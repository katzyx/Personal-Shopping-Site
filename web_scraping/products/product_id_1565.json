Give it a minute and that feeling will subdue. My partner likes it because it is visible and can be seen during application. I like it because I have not been burnt and felt my skin is protected. I have tattoos I don’t want to fade, I have scars I don’t want to deepen. This product has kept things realistically well persevered. Aging is natural, no magical cure. This product will serve its purpose for protecting you from sun damage at a reasonable rate. Recommended for active people. I apply this before bike rides, long walks, runs, and beach time."

Second time I used it (less than a week after opening it), the lotion came out separated as a clear greasy liquid as well as chunks of lotion. Can't say I'd pass on the recommendation, sadly - especially for a product of this price point."

I wore it through water and hardly reapplied, everyone I was with couldn’t believe how well my sunscreen worked. I couldn’t believe it. I am very fair and never tan for reference.

Sure maybe it's not tinted or unseen, but it works just as well and does not break out my acne-prone skin.

Besides, I’ve never found a sunscreen that doesn’t burn so, will keep looking once this one’s out!"

Oiliness isn’t a big concern when I’m running, but it’s clear that this wouldn’t work for me as a daily sunscreen because it makes me very shiny. But by far the biggest issue I have with this sunscreen is one I don’t fully understand - 3 or 4 times I wore this for a run, it turned a fluorescent yellow colour. My friend asked me what I had on my face because it looked like I had glow in the dark paint on my face. It also stained the collars of my shirts yellow. Not sure why it went yellow - it doesn’t do it every time, but it happened enough that I ended up throwing the rest in the trash. Strongly recommend skipping this one."

PROS - Works well for the body only. Thinner formula makes it easy to apply. - Smells nice, pleasant lemony scent (at the cost of potentially irritating your skin)  CONS - Absolutely unsuitable for the face. Very greasy and heavy. I could feel it sitting on my skin and it was so bothersome that I wanted to rub my face on a towel. - It contains unnecessary fragrance, which are orange peel oil and lemon peel oil. Citrus oils are co-sensitizing and don't improve the formula in any way, they are only added for scent. Dermatologist Dr Dray made a great video on citrus oils in skincare and how they are unnecessary and potentially irritating. In this PLAY sunscreen, ingredients are also listed half way down the list, which leads me to believe there is a considerable concentration of them added into the formula. This is also a Clean At Sephora product, which was misleading to me as it contains a hidden version of fragrance. - Product separates into white liquid with clear oil surrounding it. You must shake the bottle before dispensing. - Packaging. To fully tighten the lid, you have to screw it past the point where it is in line with the shape of the bottle, making it sit/store in a weird way. You also have to be careful when opening it as the product can flow out and cause a mess."

I thought I'd like this, but it's a hard no for me!  First off I don't like the fragrance. I generally go fragrance-free, but not all fragrances bother me. I don't like this one. More importantly I hate how this looks and feels on my face!! I sinks in somewhat, but left me very shiny with a really weird sticky/greasy feel. At first I applied this over skincare, then washed it off and tried reapplying on it's own to see if that'd make it less sticky/greasy - it didn't. It's possible you may enjoy the finish if you apply it sparingly, but, this is sunscreen....  I also found it stung a bit around the eyes when I applied to my whole face, which has me wondering if I'm about to develop a reaction. It'd probably work well for people with dry skin who don't have sensitivities to chemical sunscreens or fragrance (hence two stars), but I just hate how this feels on my face.  I'm planning to return this eventually, but the nearest store is over an hour away, so I'm stuck with it for now."

			"review_text": "Tried this on a recommendation from a friend. For me, the hype on this or any Supergoop spf has been completely unwarranted. The performance of this uv lotion has been abysmal.  Consistency:    Upon first buy, I perhaps received a faulty? batch because I could not get the spf to stop separating. It was not left in intense cold or heat; it was sealed prior to opening; I made sure to shake it well prior to administration. The formula barely held together, so I returned it for a new one. The second one was much better; it held together and was a fairly smooth lotion on application, as it's intended to be.  Scent:     Mild, spf-y scent that did not bother me, personally.  On Application:     Yes, stinging eyes. Yes, greasy residual feeling. Yes, mild cast.  TLDR; for price point to quantity to performance, this product is subpar. Do yourself a favour (ESP MY BIPOC FRIENDS!) and invest in an Asian spf. Your skin and bank balance will adore you for it. Eg. Rohto's Skin Aqua UV Moisture Gel, Beauty of Joseon's Rice Relief, Isntree's Water Sun Gel, Isehan's Mommy Mild UV Gel, Round Lab's Birch Juice Sun Cream (this last one is more pricey tbh), etc etc."

I was in the ocean playing in the waves and surfing so I would highly recommend this lotion especially since it's reef safe. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because my skin definitely became shiny with the feeling of a coating of sunscreen on it BUT it's pretty rare that this doesn't happen when applying sunscreen. I have combo skin and it never dried out or broke out and I preferred this to the unseen sunscreen just because I could see and feel where I put the sunscreen on my face. My eyes also burned a bit when in the ocean but was hard to tell whether that was because of salt water or sunscreen - I'd still buy it again purely for the fact that my skin tolerated it well and I never burned."
