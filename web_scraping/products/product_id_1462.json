This was a first for me. I gave this product more chances but it'd make me hate it more and more each time. The other products were pretty bad for the prices as well.

It looks so cute when you use it on your eyelids, cheeks, and lips at the same time!! I usually do that as an everyday look now because it's very buildable so you can control how pigmented you want it to appear. I don't use any makeup brushes just my hands to apply it. I use the more powdery side for my eyelids. I made a huge dent in the product so I'm going to have to buy a new one soon!"

I‚Äôm loyal to tower28 blush but more times than not I end up putting too much. Canyon is perfect for me.  When I apply it, it doesn‚Äôt show up too bold but I can build it up if I want to. And it‚Äôs great that it comes with 2 finishes. I love it! One more thing to note is that it‚Äôs scented. It‚Äôs a sweet scent but not over the top."

For a velvet-matte finish, I tapped the compressed cream formula onto cheeks with fingers. I have tried the balmy formula onto my cheeks with my fingers. The sheer side is a great buildable formula and gives a cheeky gloss look. I have layered both for formulas for my own custom finish. With either formula, it is best applied with a flat-bristle brush. This has skin-soothing camellia extract to soothe the skin. It blends and melts seamlessly into the skin. I love the natural, yet dewy cheek! I highly recommend this easy and the go blush duo!"

To me, they both have a slightly dewy finish - I‚Äôll have to play around with them more. They‚Äôre easily applied with fingers, and take a little bit of blending but nothing major - I think fingers would be easier than a brush for this product.

			"review_text": "I have been on the hunt for a nice red-based blush, and I have to admit...phew, this is a good one. Definitely don't be intimidated by the bold color of this product. With a light hand, this can actually be a very natural looking blush...even on fair skin. I'm including a photo of it applied with a stippling brush. I can't get over how easy this was to work with!  Part of me questioned whether this would work on deeper skin tones, but I then swatched this on my hand (see photo). Yep, she is buildable! Frankly...this is a fantastic formula. It doesn't pill over powder, it buffs right into the skin.  As for the things you should know: I have a dry skin type, so I feel that I am unable to attest to how it will wear on oily skin. It wore well on me but...just about everything does (if it doesn't, then we have big problems!) I will also note that it has a candy like scent, and the word aroma in the ingredients - a smidge of a pet peeve, just say fragrance!! So I would proceed with caution if you tend to react to fragrance.  Additionally, the price is a bit high in my opinion, but I would say you aren't just paying for a blush. You are paying for an experience: the packaging is kind of hard to explain, but it's shockingly cute in person. It's heavyweight, with a strong magnetic closure (STRONG - it snaps shut!) I think it's adorable, but I can see it not fitting into every vanity. It does indeed feel inspired by the DJ creators of this brand, if that makes sense lol.  Overall, I would recommend this for those who have been struggling with blush application. This was such an easy cream blush to apply, whilst I have felt some others are tricky. I received this complimentary from Simihaze, all opinions are my own."
