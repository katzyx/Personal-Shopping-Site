I did notice something that wasn't listed,this pencil does wind up if you twist the small plastic end. However, (Sephora) it does say it's sharpenable so if you desire a point you're in luck.

There is no way you can sharpen this pencil because the solid part is a really tough plastic, and it just doesn't work for how soft this pencil is.

            "review_text": "I've always been searching for a lip liner that combines intense pigmentation with staying power, and the Make Up For Ever Artist Color Pencil Extreme Waterproof Lip Liner in Caffeine certainly delivers on both fronts.  Firstly, the pigmentation is outstanding. With just one swipe, the color payoff is rich and bold, allowing for precise definition without needing multiple passes. This makes it effortless to outline and fill in the lips, whether I'm opting for a natural look or something more dramatic.  What sets this liner apart is its waterproof and transfer-proof formula. Once applied, it truly stays put throughout the day. I've tested it through meals and drinks, and I'm impressed by how well it resists fading or feathering. This reliability makes it a go-to choice for long days when I need my lip color to stay intact.  The texture is another standout feature. Despite being waterproof, the liner has a surprisingly creamy consistency that glides on smoothly without tugging at the lips. It feels comfortable and lightweight, almost like a second skin, which is crucial for all-day wear.  The shade Caffeine, a nude with a velvet matte finish, is versatile and complements a wide range of lipsticks and glosses. I often wear it alone for a natural look or as a base to enhance the longevity of my lip color. The matte finish adds a touch of sophistication without feeling overly drying.  The Make Up For Ever Artist Color Pencil Extreme Waterproof Lip Liner in Caffeine has become a staple in my makeup routine. Its exceptional pigmentation, waterproof formula, and comfortable wear make it a must-have for anyone looking for a reliable lip liner that won't disappoint."

I finally found a lip liner that stays put and lasts. It holds up for about half my work day, I feel like after lunch it starts to fade slowly. I hope they come out with some pink and berry shades of this line up, because I would buy them all.  :) This starts by going on creamy and dries down very fast. It feels a little drying on my lips but it's bearable, especially for the long lasting results. I only use this to line my lips, I don't fill them completely in."

I did not notice any scent, so if you're someone who is sensitive, this will work nicely for you. The stay power is there, and if you fill your lips with this, or a matte lipstick, it's transfer proof. In this photo I paired it with a regular lipstick which did eventually fade, but the liner was still in place. It's very pretty, and I think I need to check out the different shade options.

I loved that the color lasted the entire event I went to, which is incredible for me to be able to wear eyeliner without worrying about touching it up and without smudges on my lips.  The finish is velvety, super soft and matte on the lips. I'm enjoying using the Artist Color Pencil on its own, it's worked really well for me."
