I had been searching for something to help calm my eczema flare ups that would occur around and even on my lips, my nose as well as my under eye area and eye lids. Needless to say it was very painful and in those specific areas I couldn’t use my medication to treat as much as I would with a body breakout. This was my lifesaver. I use it everyday and when I am in the middle of a breakout I carry it with me to reapply throughout the day. I also started using their eczema face and body wash, it pairs really well with this cream too!   Just and FYI, I didn’t take any pictures of my flare ups at there start or the worst, the first picture is of a minor flare up."

			"review_text": "This winter has been aweful for my skin, leaving me with eczema all over my face - around my mouth, sides of my nose, inner and out corners of my eyes, my forehead, temples, hairline and chin/neck area. I used this cream and it worked. It didn't break me out (like other thick eczema creams do), great for watery and sensitive eyes, and was quick to absorb. I also have not seen an eczema cream out there with 5% colloidal oatmeal (most are at 1%) so this stuff is extra strength. My husband also used this on his forehead (he had dry itchy red bumps) and his forehead cleared up quite a bit overnight. I used this morning and night, two pumps each time to also cover my neck, and I could not be happier with the results - the large eczema patch in the middle of my face is gone. And my hair line eczema also calmed down significantly. I still have a few patches here and there but i dont see peeling and dont feel itchiness anymore. I honestly love this product and would buy it regularly, however.... This is quite expensive for a small bottle, and I can't open and use up the remaining product so i feel like there's waste. I also don't like that this is not refillable, though I'm not sure if this is meant for long term use. Also I don't think it's worth using on your body as it will not last a month if used twice a day. Side note: it has a grainy texture which I actually liked. I also liked the subtle scent of the cream, almost like olive oil? Overall, this product is great and I really like the formulation, but the packaging I'm not so sure if it's the best because I cannot open the bottle and scoop up any remaining product."

We have tried every non-steroidal cream to try and help with this, but none worked completely.

None of them worked. Finally, I discovered this product. Within minutes of my first application, I could tell it was working. After applying it again the next morning, there was a significant difference in the color and texture of my skin. Within 72 hours, my entire face had cleared up. At the moment, if I stop using this product for more than 2 days, my eczema flares back up. I've been struggling the past several months, and within days, this brought me the relief I needed."

I will continue to use it to see how well it can actually clear. my particular case of eczema is moderate so I don't expect it to be 100 percent effective.  the one drawback is while working on the skin barrier, my skin is very itchy still and I really have to fight not to scratch because it is working but it doesn't really calm the itch sensation. possibly exacerbates it to a degree.  I would purchase it again though, I do look significantly better in a short amount of time."

			"review_text": "I’ve been struggling with eyelid dermatitis since October 2023. Started as a small patch, was treating at home with different creams from the drugstore. By February 2024 I had a massive flare and both my eyes were literally red swollen panda eyes up to my eyebrows and down to my cheekbones. I did have to go in a steroid cream, but after the flare went down I saw a dermatologist who recommended this eczema balm. I was hesitant to try it because of all the bad reviews with the reformulation, but bought it anyway.  I like it, it hasn’t made my dermatitis flare up again (I’m now off the steroid cream). I don’t find it particularly hydrating though, and I’m not a fan of the slight gritty texture. I top it with the skinfix barrier repair cream (also recommended by my derm), and the two products work well together. I’m not sure if I would have wanted to try the original formula, only because I did try Vaseline, aquafor and baby aveeno eczema balm and they all made my dermatitis worse so for my particular case I think super occlusive products don’t work. This reformulated version is much lighter as it’s more cream based. A little goes a long way so I think this will last be a while. Good ingredients too. 4 stars because I wish it was more hydrating and had a smoother texture."

Something I loved about the old formula is that it was great at locking in hydration and preventing transepidermal water loss. The new formula is thin and lightweight, a significant and disappointing departure from the original. I understand things need to be reformulated sometimes, and Skinfix has claimed that this new formula is allegedly more effective at treating eczema, but this was such an extreme departure from the original that it's a shock. This feels like a standard, lightweight moisturizer now, which can be found in abundance, and whatever other ingredient changes that may have been made in combination with the texture change have rendered it ineffective for me. Not just ineffective, but rather it has, in fact, made my skin worse. Also, if you filter out the reviews that were made by people who were gifted this product by Skinfix, not a single review from a verified purchaser is positive."

Whereas most skincare items I apply would typically irritate areas with eczema, this one feels very soothing.  I would especially recommend this to anyone with combination or oily skin because it’s not at all heavy or greasy, it absorbs quickly, and it leaves a matte finish.

However, this new formula upon application made my skin feel like it was on fire and caused my eczema to flare up and made it even worse. The old formula was almost like Vaseline, this one is more like a cream. I will say that I do like the pump packaging a lot better than the old squeeze packaging, but please bring back the old formula!!!  Old on left side of picture, new on right side."

In terms of the actual product, I thought this was going to be a stick balm type of product, so I was surprised to see the pump. The balm is a thick, mint green cream with no fragrance. I used it on the dry patches on my body and it definitely helped make them feel more moisturized. I’ve used it a few times so far and it hasn’t clear any of those dry patches up or anything, but it does provide itch relief that I sometimes get with them.

What sets this product apart is its unique blend of natural ingredients like chamomile, calendula, and colloidal oatmeal, known for their anti-inflammatory and healing properties. These ingredients work together to calm irritated skin and reduce redness, providing a noticeable reduction in itching.  I appreciate that the Eczema+ Dermatitis Relief Balm is fragrance-free, making it suitable for even the most sensitive skin. It doesn't feel greasy or heavy upon application, and a little goes a long way, making the product last longer than expected. I've noticed a significant improvement in the overall condition of my skin since incorporating this balm into my daily routine.  Gifted by Skinfix."

The texture of the balm glides over the rough patches easily and penetrates pretty deep, I was able to feel the itchiness substantially subside after a couple minutes.  My skin felt like it was not only protected but after using it a few days the patches weren’t as bad and I’ll take that as a win/win! I’ve only tried one other brand years ago and this balm works extremely well almost better in regards to the softness I felt on my chin. I’m just thankful to have found something that will be cost effective for me to continue using! One thing I did notice and am grateful for is a little dab will do ya!!

This fall/winter has been brutal so far and I was really feeling discouraged until I discovered this balm. I decided to take a chance, my last chance, and boy am I glad I did! I wasn’t expecting a miracle because until we get to the root cause nothing will “fix” the eczema, but it provides my daughter relief and that is all I can ask for. We have been using it twice daily with some added applications as needed. As you can see from the pictures, the skin on her knee is starting to actually heal and I’m not sure I’ve ever seen it do that without using the steroid cream. I will say, I am not a fan of the bottle. I’ve had a few occasions where I couldn’t get the product to come out, which can be frustrating with a squirmy toddler. But I will take the frustration if it means my daughter isn’t up all night itching. I will definitely be repurchasing!"

I do recommend using a little extra at nights as I would while I wake up in the morning with super moisturizing skin.    I received this product complimentary from Skeepers and Skinfx in exchange for my honest review."

I am new to this Skinfix Eczema + Dermatitis relief Balm, and it's been a welcome addition! This “balm” is incredibly soothing and effective at calming my itchy, irritated, weepy skin. The balm absorbs quickly, leaving no greasy residue. I have been using this product for a week now. I apply it behind my ears morning and night.  At first application, there is a sense of burning. Probably because my skin is cracked open raw.  But this goes away not too long after applying.  What I love about Skinfix Eczema Balm: * Fast relief: The balm starts working immediately to soothe and calm my skin. * Long-lasting hydration: My skin feels soft and moisturized for hours after applying the balm. * Gentle and effective: The balm is formulated with natural ingredients, so it's gentle enough for sensitive skin. It contains 5% colloidal oatmeal which I have found is vital for soothing eczema relief and skin protection. It also contains jojoba oil, macadamia seed oil, squalane, shea butter and ceramide.  * Visible results: I've noticed a significant improvement in the overall health and appearance of my skin since using this balm. * It has helped me to stop scratching my eczema, which prevents further irritation and scarring.  Overall, I am pleased with this product and do recommend Skinfix Eczema Balm to anyone struggling with eczema or atopic dermatitis. It's a gentle and effective product that has made a big difference in my life thus far. I do have another tried and true brand and product that I use regularly. Yet, this Skinfix will be added to my collection of effective skincare products. This product was gifted by Skinfix."

What impressed me the most was that it wasn't greasy at all and had a very subtle scent. Using it was a breeze, as I only needed to pump a dime-sized amount onto my palm. I have eczema on my lower back, and I noticed that the itching subsided after applying it for the second time. It provided my skin with much-needed moisture and a comforting sensation, especially on the dry patches. One of the things I loved about this product is its versatility - I could use it on both my face and body. Overall, I highly recommend this product!"

It helped soothe and reduce dry scaly irritated skin on my neck , and it completely cleared up a patch of eczema on my roommate’s back in only a couple of applications. It’s really nice because it’s so unobtrusive once you put it on, and it’s effective as well!

So I was really excited to see that skinfix had a new relief balm designed for eczema and even more excited to get to try it.   I’ve never used anything that was so instantaneously soothing on my hands. No stinging, no red lines, it just made my hands feel about 90% of the way back to normal on the first use. I’m so happy to have this available for the rest of the winter and am excited to try it on areas other than my hands as my eczema inevitably flares up.

I have tried so many different creams and lotions to alleviate the itching, but nothing has worked as well as this balm! It felt soothing immediately upon application and quickly remedied the itching. This product is honestly quite a bit more expensive than what I would normally spend on a body lotion, but after seeing (and feeling) the results, I will definitely be repurchasing this! The cream is thick and has a light green hue. It has a strong, neutral smell to it that was not unpleasant. It did not cause any burning, itching, or irritation when applied over sensitive dry areas. I like that the balm can be used on both body and face skin. It is incredibly gentle and soothing. It contains ingredients like colloidal oatmeal and ceramides and is free from fragrances and harsh ingredients. The only minor complaint I have about this product is that the pump has been a bit inconsistent. It can be hard to get product out and sometimes I have to pump multiple times to get any out. Hopefully this will improve as I continue to use the product."

I have eczema on my face and body, and this balm has helped to soothe and relieve my symptoms significantly. The balm is thick and creamy, but it absorbs quickly into the skin without feeling greasy. It has a light, pleasant scent that's not too overpowering. I like that it's also fragrance-free, which is important for sensitive skin. I've been applying the balm to my affected areas twice a day, and I've noticed a big improvement in my skin. My eczema flare-ups are less frequent and less severe, and the dryness and itchiness that I often experience have been significantly reduced. My skin overall feels calmer, smoother, and more hydrated. I appreciate that the balm is formulated with natural and gentle ingredients like colloidal oatmeal, ceramides, and hyaluronic acid. These ingredients work together to soothe irritation, strengthen the skin barrier, and lock in moisture. This makes it a great option for sensitive skin like mine. One of my favorite things about this balm is that it's so versatile. I can use it on both my face and body, and it's effective at relieving a variety of eczema symptoms. I've also found that it's helpful for other skin conditions like psoriasis and dry skin."

It comes in an airless pump bottle and dispenses and applies very easily. There’s no added fragrance but you get a light scent from the colloidal oatmeal that an ingredient. It instantly soothed my irritated skin and left my skin soft and itch free."

Only takes me about 5 minutes to fully rub in. I also am not scared of getting oil stains on my clothes with this on because it really does dry very quickly. I personally don’t find it has a fragrance which is a plus especially when dealing with my eczema. Overall, I truly does seem to give me some relief and help out my skin. I’m excited as we head deeper into the winter months to have this on hand. I was offered by skinfix."

This balm has calming colloidal oatmeal and I love that it’s steroid free. It’s so easy to apply in the stick format, and I love that it’s safe for my eyebrows and face, and rest of body. This is mess free and soothing for when I have breakouts from weather or stress. I like that it doesn’t have a smell either. I love the balm and stick format—it’s so easy to apply."

I slip this product into my bag for super itchy emergencies like the wintertime or whenever I’ve been scratching my skin like crazy the night before. Great for any inflammation or just dry, patchy skin in general on my arms, back of legs, and back of my neck. Love that this is actually 100% clean and there’s no artificial fragrance in the formula. Definitely helps with my skin from being flaky."
