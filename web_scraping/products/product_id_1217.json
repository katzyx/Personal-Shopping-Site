			"review_text": "Got the jumbo bottle last year, it lasts for a veryyy long time!   I use it with my hands directly to apply, I feel like with a pad most of the product will be wasted.  This is good and effective, however. It can BURN your skin! It will feel really tingly burning if you go over any open/sensitive spots like a popped pimple :( (I know we all get tempted to do that lol) or small accidental cuts from dermaplaning.  Otherwise, I would recommend to use as a toner, just keep in mind it is HARSH! build up your tolerance slowly!"

			"review_text": "I bought this product for the first time a few years ago when my oily, dehydrated skin was riddled with post-acne hyperpigmentation. I was desperate and after doing my research, I was down to two products. One was Glow2OH and the other I can’t remember. (I never had to go back for it so I can’t remember.) This product gently helped clear my deep skin of my cheetah spots without compromising the integrity of my skin.  Upon reflection, I realized that my skin never looked as clear as when I had this toner in my routine. I am embarrassed to say I have strayed in the years since, but my next purchase will be this toner. I need it back on my shelf."
