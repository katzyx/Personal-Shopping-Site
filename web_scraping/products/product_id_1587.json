			"review_text": "Was curious to see if this was an hourglass dupe - definitely less “inner glow” and more shimmery than hourglass, but not chunky or glittery. I use the pink shades as a blush topper and the bronze shade as a bronzer topper and they blend beautifully on top of other powder products. Only complaint is the bronzer shade is way too orange too use on its own on fair skin."
