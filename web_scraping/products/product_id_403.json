I’ve been struggling with my skin for a while, both with breakouts and a depleted barrier, and this helped to heal and prepare my skin before makeup aplication. All of my other products settled so great after using this, and my skin was radiant and refreshed. Did not cause ant breakouts, instead soothed my skin. Love this so much!!!"
