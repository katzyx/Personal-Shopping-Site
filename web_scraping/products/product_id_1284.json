I started using it every other night, applying a small amount to a cotton pad and gently swiping it over my clean, dry face. There’s a slight tingling sensation, but it’s not uncomfortable.  Within a few weeks, I noticed my skin was smoother, with a more even tone and fewer breakouts. My skin feels softer and looks more radiant. After a few months of use, I’ve received numerous compliments on my glowing complexion.  Paula's Choice Skin Perfecting 6% Mandelic Acid + 2% Lactic Acid Liquid Exfoliant is a fantastic addition to any skincare routine. It’s effective in improving texture and tone while being gentle enough for regular use. If you’re looking for a reliable exfoliant, this one is definitely worth trying!"

My skin feels better and hurts less to the touch. So the bigger pimples are almost gone and now there’s the small pea sky ones left."

			"review_text": "The product has a lightweight, slightly viscous texture that feels smooth upon application. I found it absorbed quickly without leaving a greasy or sticky residue. Over the weeks of consistent use, I noticed a subtle reduction in the appearance of fine lines. The mandelic and lactic acids gently exfoliate and promote cell turnover, which helped in softening the fine lines, especially around my forehead and mouth. There was a noticeable improvement in my skin's texture and tone. My skin felt smoother, and the rough bumps I previously had were significantly reduced. The redness and slight hyperpigmentation I usually experience seemed less prominent, contributing to a more even complexion overall. One of the most impressive changes was in my skin's luminosity and radiance. The exfoliant effectively removed dead skin cells, revealing a brighter, more radiant complexion. My skin looked more vibrant and had a healthy glow, which was a welcome change from its usual dullness. In summary, Paula's Choice 6% Mandelic Acid + 2% Lactic Acid Exfoliant made a noticeable difference in my skin's fine lines, texture, tone, and overall radiance. It’s a gentle yet effective product that suits my dry skin and addresses my concerns with redness and hyperpigmentation."

I started off with using this twice a week and noticed immediately my whiteheads and blackheads diminish. I don’t do more than twice a week simply because my regular routine maintains enough. You only need about three drops to fully cover your face. I’m so confident in the results I took a picture of my skin using my phones back camera to truly show how even my skin looks. I have oily, acne prone and sensitive skin. Normally my face is full of small pimples, fungal acne and enlarged pores. With this added to my consistent routine, it has changed for the better plus!

If you also have very sensitive skin you may want to start with 2-3 times a week at first to see how your skin reacts.

It’s softer, smoother and I’m excited for more results with continued and consistent use!! I usually use a makeup wipe or cleansing balm to take my makeup off, cleanse my face then use this and am always shocked that dirt/makeup is still coming off! This stuff really works well and I’m confident it’s doing amazing things for my skin! Also, LOVE that it comes with a safety seal (that’s a huge must for me with my skincare)!"

			"review_text": "I've been using this leave-on exfoliant for a few weeks now, and I couldn't be happier with the results! The texture is lightweight and slightly viscous, making it easy to spread evenly over my skin. I apply it over my face and neck with my fingers or a cotton pad, and it absorbs quickly without leaving any sticky residue. It’s simple to incorporate into my routine, and there’s no need to rinse it off, which is a big plus.  I've noticed a visible reduction in fine lines. They appear softer and less pronounced, which has given my skin a smoother, more youthful look. The exfoliant has significantly improved my skin's texture. It feels much smoother to the touch, and the overall tone of my skin is more even. Dark spots and discoloration have diminished, giving my complexion a more uniform appearance.  One of the most impressive changes has been the increase in my skin’s luminosity. My skin looks brighter and more radiant. The dullness I used to experience has been replaced with a healthy glow that gets noticed! I highly recommend taking pictures in natural lighting to truly capture the amazing transformation. It's incredible to see the before-and-after difference without any need for photoshop.  This product, with its blend of mandelic and lactic acids along with yarrow extract, has delivered on all its promises. It gently exfoliates, smooths texture, softens fine lines, and brightens my skin. The added benefits of supporting the skin’s microbiome and barrier with a fermented antioxidant blend make it a standout in my skincare routine. If you're looking for an effective and gentle exfoliant, this one is definitely worth trying!"

The 2% salicylic acid from Paula's choice also doesn't work for my skin because it just dried me out, but didn't minimize or prevent my hormonal cystic acne. I was hoping that this combination of acids would help, but it's just not doing much after twice daily use for almost a month.    At night I use the Derma E 10% acid peel after double cleansing, follow it up with a 10% glycolic acid peel pad from Bliss and then follow that up with this exfoliating liquid, a hydrating serum, and the Shani Darden peptide moisturizer and it has taken so long to even get my acne to a point of no longer being painful. I had been using benzoyl peroxide for the past 15 years until we found out that it degrades into benzene.   This product might work for someone with mild acne who just wants to make sure they're not clogging pores further after washing their face after working out or something? My face had built a significant tolerance to acids as I can use 10% glycolic acid nightly with no issues of burning or even dryness."

The 6% mandelic acid +2% lactic acid liquid exfoliant works great on my combination skin to combat breakouts, smooth my skins texture, and doesn’t irritate. My skin always looks brighter the day after I use this at night. It’s a thin consistency that dries down quickly and layers well underneath my night cream. I haven’t gotten any irritation or burning, as are both pretty gentle exfoliants and were even recommended by my dermatologist for sensitive skin that has active breakouts.

The combination of mandelic and lactic acids provides a gentle yet effective exfoliation that has noticeably improved the texture and clarity of my skin.  What sets this exfoliant apart is its ability to target multiple skin concerns. The 6% mandelic acid helps with uneven skin tone and discoloration, while the 2% lactic acid works to exfoliate and refine the skin's surface. I've noticed a reduction in hyperpigmentation and a smoother complexion since incorporating it into my routine.  One of the standout features is its lightweight, liquid formula. It's easy to apply and absorbs quickly, making it suitable for both morning and evening use. The absence of a strong fragrance is also a plus for those with sensitive skin.  I appreciate the thoughtful packaging with a dispenser that ensures precise application and minimizes waste. The product has lasted longer than expected, considering a little goes a long way.  While the price point is higher than some drugstore options, the quality and results justify the investment. If you're looking for a versatile AHA exfoliant that addresses various skin concerns without irritation, Paula's Choice Mandelic Acid+ Lactic Acid AHA Liquid Exfoliant is worth considering for your skincare routine."

This product works wonders and is super easy to use (I just apply it on clean dry skin after cleansing and before moisturizer). I have oily skin that gets clogged super easily and this exfoliator didn't cause any irritation/clogged pores. My skin is looking and feeling super smooth, glowing and I see some of the pigmentation dissapearing.  Overall amazing product!   I've received this product complimentary in exchange for my honest review."

Liquid exfoliants don't need to be used daily of course, but they do take some time to work - this is not overnight. Also remember to wear your spf & protect your skin.

I have noticed a slight difference in the fine lines and wrinkles on my face, but not a drastic difference. My face does seem brighter after using the product for about a week. The consistency of the product is smooth and easy to use. It can be easily applied to your face and neck with your finger tips, however, I find it easier to be applied with a cotton ball or cotton pad. If you do not like to use a facial sunscreen use with caution. It is recommended to use a broad spectrum sunscreen rated at least 30 SPF. The reason sunscreen is recommended is due to the alpha hydroxy acid (AHA) in the product, as it can increase sun sensitivity, and possibly even sunburn. Overall this is a good product. I can see myself using other products from this line."

This product has become my go-to solution for achieving a more even complexion, even though I don't reach for it as often as I would like due to its scent.  The liquid exfoliant has a powerful formula that gently removes dead skin cells and unclogs pores, leaving my skin feeling incredibly smooth and renewed. I've noticed a significant improvement in the overall texture of my skin since incorporating this product into my skincare regimen. It has helped to minimize the appearance of rough patches and has given my skin a youthful and radiant glow.  However, the only downside for me is the scent of the product. While it's not overpowering, it's not particularly pleasant either. This is the only reason why I don't reach for it as often as I would like. But, the results it delivers definitely make up for this minor inconvenience.  If you're looking to achieve a more even skin texture and improve the overall appearance of your complexion, I highly recommend giving this liquid exfoliant a try. Despite the scent, its powerful formula will leave your skin feeling smooth, rejuvenated, and ready to take on the day."

I did some research on liquid exfoliants because my skin can be sensitive to certain things and I did not want to ruin my skin. I was surprised at how gentle this product was on my skin. I only use it at night 2-3 times a week and honestly, after the first use my skin did feel and look fresh and clean. There was this slight glow to it. I'm excited to see how this can benefit my skin long term."

			"review_text": "I recently tried the 6% Mandelic Acid+ 2% Lactic Acid Liquid Exfoliant and I have to say, I am thoroughly impressed with the results. As someone with sensitive skin, I am always hesitant to try new exfoliants, but this product proved to be gentle yet effective.  Firstly, I love that this exfoliant contains both mandelic and lactic acid. Mandelic acid is known for its ability to penetrate deeper into the skin without causing irritation, while lactic acid helps to brighten and hydrate the skin. Together, they make a powerful combination that leaves my skin feeling smooth and looking radiant.  The liquid formula is easy to apply and absorbs quickly into the skin. I have been using it twice a week and have noticed a significant improvement in the texture of my skin. My pores appear smaller and my skin feels much softer. I have also noticed a reduction in the appearance of dark spots and acne scars.  One of the things I appreciate most about this product is that it is free from harsh chemicals and fragrances. It is also cruelty-free, which is a huge plus for me. I have not experienced any irritation or redness while using this exfoliant, which is a rare find for someone with sensitive skin.  I also love that this exfoliant comes in a dark glass bottle with a dropper, making it easy to dispense just the right amount of product. A little goes a long way, so I can see this bottle lasting me a while.  Overall, I highly recommend the 6% Mandelic Acid+ 2% Lactic Acid Liquid Exfoliant to anyone looking for a gentle yet effective exfoliant. It has become a staple in my skincare routine and I will definitely be repurchasing. Give it a try and see the amazing results for yourself!"

I feel like this is probably targeted more for those people who can't tolerate a higher level of chemical exfoliation or who are just getting started with using actives in their skin care routine and need a well-formulated beginning product.  I'm accustomed to using more potent actives in my skincare routine so this probably doesn't have quite the same impact on me that it might on someone else.

When i saw that this new exfoliant has Mandelic which is more gentle, i was more hopeful. I was not disappointed and tbh it even exceeded my expectations! I feel like this works for my dry skin than the original (BHA) formula. The effect is really noticeable the following day. My skin feels smoother and it helped with my overall skin texture. I am not new to acids so i jumped to 2x a day and my skin was fine with it. I only skip it on Tretinoin nights. Best way to apply for me is using my palms and patting on my face. Not a big fan of the scent but not a deal breaker considering how it smooths my skin!"

Four stars because the price and because I believe the percentage is less than similar products that are less expensive.

This product is a true game-changer for my skin! First off, the combination of mandelic acid and lactic acid in this liquid exfoliant is brilliant. These ingredients work together to gently exfoliate my skin, promoting cell turnover and revealing a brighter, smoother complexion. Unlike harsh scrubs or peels, this liquid exfoliant is incredibly gentle and non-irritating, making it suitable for even sensitive skin types like mine. What sets Paula's Choice apart is their commitment to science-backed formulas. I trust their products because they are backed by research and formulated with high-quality ingredients. This exfoliant is no exception. It's fragrance-free, alcohol-free, and doesn't contain any unnecessary additives, which is a huge plus for those with sensitive or reactive skin. Another standout feature is the lightweight texture of the liquid. It absorbs quickly into my skin without leaving any greasy or sticky residue behind. I simply apply a small amount to a cotton pad and gently swipe it across my face and neck. It's so easy to incorporate into my skincare routine, and I love how it preps my skin for the rest of my products. Since incorporating this exfoliant into my routine, I've noticed a remarkable improvement in my skin's texture and clarity. My pores appear smaller, and my skin feels incredibly smooth and soft to the touch. Additionally, I've noticed a reduction in the appearance of acne scars and hyperpigmentation, which is a dream come true! Furthermore, Paula's Choice is a brand I trust and admire.

I don't use this every day just when my skin needs a pick me up, usually every 2 days, but could be used up to 2 times, depending on the skin needs. I can see the improvement in my skin appearance.

Liquid Exfoliants are somewhat new to me, I've only tried 2 others aside from this one, but the difference here is that my skin was not irritated after the first few uses. When first applying it to a cotton round, I liked that there was no fragrance and that the liquid consistency was easy to manage. It didn't burn upon application to my face or leave any residue whatsoever. It felt as gentle as water and looks like it as well, but the results I saw in the morning were impressive. I tend to get rough bumps around my jawline that only go away after manual exfoliation, but the problem with manual exfoliants are that I always break out the next day. Paula's Choice 6% Mandelic Acid + 2% Lactic Acid Liquid Exfoliant smoothed my face out overnight on the first use. After the next use I could see more evening out of my skin tone, making my face look alive, glowing and healthy. The craziest thing is that my dark spots are fading, especially above my lip where I have melasma areas. I haven't used it long term yet, but I'm so excited to see how much clearer my face can look. I'm 36 years old so it's a struggle wanting to have the skin I knew most of my life and seeing the signs of aging. This is very promising!"

I can even feel by touching my skin, how much softer my skin is and it clearly helped my fine lined as well as they are no longer as pronounced as it used to be. Most importantly I tend to have melasma and this gentle exfoliant does not seem to disrupt it nor make it come back. Much saver than other acids I have used! Extremely pleased with it!"

I'm happy to report that this does not sting my skin on application, and yet does deliver results.  I prefer to apply this liquid exfoliant with a cotton pad as it does have a very watery texture. As there is no added fragrance, this has a bit of a skincare smell (for lack of better description). It is using 6% mandelic acid, which is quite a gentle exfoliant, paired with 2% lactic acid - I appreciate the disclosure as it's both reassuring for my skin type and also allows me to monitor the progress of these levels. Given my skin type, I have stuck with using this every other day although the brand suggests usage of up to twice daily. I would recommend you use this at whatever frequency feels most fitting to your own needs.  Even with alternating day usage, I saw results on a stubborn discoloration patch (note: it was fresh, which is always easier to bounce back from than long-term spots). I'm overall very happy with this release and think it offers an in between option vs stronger or more gentle exfoliants."

I find patting it in works best, has a slight acid smell, but looking at the ingredients, its understandable! This is definitely a lighter liquid exfoliant so you can use it daily and it won’t purge or sensitise your skin (UNLESS you have sensitive skin- then use it once a day or once every two days!!) Lastly, for the price point, I find it worth, especially cause four-five drops is enough for the whole face! I would recommend if you really just need help with fine lines and darks spots/post-acne scars!!! Dropping a star because while the price point for 3ox is valid when comparing to Paula’s Choices’ other products. In general, it still is a hefty price tag."

It’s fitting that  this 6% Mandelic Acid+ 2% Lactic Acid Liquid Exfoliant from Paula’s Choice was my first product to form an opinion of their skincare. Exfoliating is my jam and I was stoked to test this baby out! 🖤  This is a gentle leave on AHA that smooths my skin tone and texture with zero irritation. My skin feels smooth, refreshed and cleansed, without feeling tightened. I like to use this the day before I dermaplane and my skin always looks and feels amazing!! It is a great, gentle exfoliant. I really love exfoliating products and so far I’m impressed with this one from Paula’s Choice! It was definitely a great intro product for me. 🖤"

It's a game-changer for those with sensitive skin like mine.  The formula works diligently to remove dead skin cells, unveiling a radiant and more , luminous ,even-toned skin texture. I’ve also noticed a reduction in the appearance of dark spots and uneven skin tone. Unlike some exfoliants that can be drying, this liquid formula is non-drying and leaves my skin feeling very hydrated. I have also noticed a reduction in fine lines and wrinkles. The liquid formula makes application a super easy process. I use a few drops on a cotton pad, and it glides effortlessly across my skin. It absorbs quickly, leaving no residue or stickiness.Very pleased ! 10/10 !"
