The product is gentle and extremely effective, you are visibly able to see the difference directly after use. The product has a rather strong citrus scent so if you like citrusy smells this product is a no brainer for you.  Application is so unique for an exfoliant, the spray applicator makes it rather easy to target areas of your skin such as your neck or chest. I like that I can control the spray and the amount used.  My skin looks brighter, fresher and noticeably tighter after using this product. The following day my skincare and makeup applied amazingly and lasted even longer throughout the day, thanks to this peel.  I would definitely recommend purchasing this product if youu2019re in the market for an effective yet gentle exfoliating product. I am so grateful to have received a full sized product to review from BzzAgent for free in exchange for my honest review."

I was so hopeful because I try not to let one trial influence my testing experience. Sadly again my eye was so swollen and hurt. It might be a bit to concentrated. I donu2019t normally have sensitive skin so I was so surprised!"

Your dead skin comes off as your scrub. It is very fragrant so if youu2019re not a fan of citrus it may not be for you. If youu2019re looking for a great exfoliant for your face and neck, this will work for you."

Products works well, you can feel it exfoliating as soon as you start rubbing it in. Easy to use and washes off instantly which I like. It did not irritate my skin or break me out.

I usually exfoliate during a hot shower or bath so my skin softens as it makes the exfoliation process effortless and satisfying as you see the dead skin roll off.   This product gave similar results where after applying and massaging the skin, I felt little rolls clumping up. However, Iu2019m not sure how much of it is product vs dead skin. Also, rinse well, preferably with a cleanser as the product is a bit sticky and will leave a residue.   The applicator says itu2019s a spray but itu2019s more of a heavy squirt. I feel like aiming with it is hard and I got it straight in my eye the first time.   Do I see an improvement in my skin right after? Not really. Maybe with consistent use youu2019ll see results but I still prefer natural exfoliation methods that give you real results with having the added chemicals to my routine."

Iu2019m trying to imagine that I purchased this as Iu2019m using it, and it is a bit pricey but I still feel really happy with it. I really enjoy exfoliating my skin (younger me used to love the famous apricot scrubs but as Iu2019ve matured Iu2019ve moved onto gentler but more effective products).  This peel spray feels so gentle, but it works instantly. In the shower I spritz all over my face, let it settle for a few moments, then gently rub my skin. It immediately u201cpillsu201d and rinses off easily. My skin feels noticeable smoother and softer every time! And visually it looks refreshed. My skin isnu2019t too sensitive but can easily become red, and I donu2019t get any redness from using this. There is also no drying effect or stinging at all, and my skin seems to soak up my moisturizer more afterwards.  Iu2019ve tried other exfoliating peels from different brands, and none are as gentle as this while still feeling super effective.  I like the spray formulation, itu2019s super quick and mess free. The whole process takes less than a minute and my skin feels amazing after!  There is a lemony scent that I enjoy, even though Iu2019m not a big fan of scented products for my face. I could see some not enjoying it as much, but for me itu2019s not an issue at all. The price might deter some people but thereu2019s enough product to get many uses out of it, and for me itu2019s like an instant facial so definitely worth it. Iu2019m really happy to have tried this product and would definitely buy this on my own now."

I was skeptical about smoother skin after one use, but itu2019s completely true!  I havenu2019t used it enough yet to say whether it helps with wrinkles, but my skin felt clean and soft after use.  You can see and feel the old skin rubbing off under your fingers - gross but satisfying!  It has a mild and very pleasant smell.  I probably wouldnu2019t use it every day, but will use 2-3 times a week in the shower.  It is easy to apply, just spray onto your face and rub in with your fingers. I would buy this product rather than a harsh exfoliant."

Iu2019d prefer to apply a thin layer than to spray it. For me, the application is a deal breaker so I wonu2019t finish it."
