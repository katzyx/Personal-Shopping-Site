I have sadly and mistakenly overlooked this shade for what it is.  It's the BEST lip topper, because it's got different colors of glitter in it, giving it that holographic quality.  It brings extra oomph to any lip, but I've used it with browns and pinks.  The brown lippies look bronzed and pinks were golden.  By itself, the gloss is pretty, but nothing terribly exciting oddly enough."

It goes on beautifully, smooth without being sticky, and the shimmer was consistent. For myself, I like it best over a deeper colour lipstick, as I found that this colour was more nude on me, and I prefer to go darker with my lippies. It makes a beautiful topper, which is how I'll use it in future. I plan to try other Pat McGrath lip glosses after trying this one. Lovely."

I've owned several of these glosses, paid for by my self over the last several years as well, though they are all cream shades.  This was not a shade I would have chosen for myself, and I'm kind of glad that I was sent it.  The base colour is lightly peachy, but a 'my lips but better' shade.  The sparkle in this is pink and gold as advertised.  I can not feel any of the glitter in this formula when I rub my lips together.  The gloss itself feels a bit plush when it's applied and doesn't accentuate any dryness.  The gloss fades over time in a nice way, and is easy to re-apply without a mirror.  It doesn't dry out my lips after applying several times throughout the day.  There is a slight scent to it that dissipates after a minute or two.  It's a sweet smell.   I'll be purchasing more, likely most in the cream formula, however I'll pick up a few glitter and shimmer versions as I see shades that appeal to me."

Its listed as a glitter, but I felt it has more of a light shimmer but not a full on sparkle like some other shades. In this photo, I’m wearing as a topper over a lip tint.

I have a couple of these Pat McGrath Labs lip glosses in my makeup collection and was thrilled to receive Bronze Divinity as part of a holiday gratis last year. This is my honest and authentic opinion, as a Sephora Beauty Insider Community Ambassador after having worn this gloss for the better part of the last month.  WHAT I LIKE:  * Goes on easily and smoothly, which was surprisingly nice for a thicker gloss - it doesn’t feel heavy, goopy or tacky * Wears comfortably * Smoothing & hydrating  * Adds a beautiful, glossy shine to lips  * Has a slight blurring effect on the lips * Color is beautiful on its own or as a topper - it’s a shimmery bronzey nude with pretty, rosy gold undertones  * Fairly long wearing for a gloss - I can get about 3-4 hours with it, even with sipping on water, coffee & tea throughout the day, though of course there’s some fading and wearing away   AREA(S) FOR IMPROVEMENT:  * While Pat McGrath offers a good selection of shades in this line, I wouldn’t mind seeing the range expand even more.   FYI:  * The thickness of the product makes my lips feel nourished while I have on the gloss   BUY 🛍️ or BYE👋🏼?:  * A definite BUY"

			"review_text": "I received the shade Bronze Divinity as a gratis from Sephora but I have used the Pat McGrath glosses almost since they came out. It’s a thicker formula but it’s not sticky and doesn’t bleed on my lip lines. This shade was a little intimidating in the tube but I loved it once I applied it. It makes my lips slightly darker and more brown with a beautiful pearl finish. I wouldn’t have purchased this myself based on the color but now that I have it, I would definitely recommend it to almost anyone as I think it would suit most skintones."

The best thing about this product is the outer packaging and the smell of the lipglosses (smells like vanilla cake)  The formula is so thin, it almost feels like a tinted lip balm.  The shine is very lackluster… and when removing the product from lips, it leaves this waxy film coating on the lips. There’s nothing moisturizing about this formula. It’s so thin, the color creases on the lips. And when looking at the gloss, it’s hard to detect which brand it is since “PML” logo very small and the color is on the bottom with a sticker. Actual product feels VERY CHEAP.  I prefer FENTY beauty gloss bomb, MAC lipglass, morphe Madison beer lipgloss over this product.  Save your money… or invest in PML gel lip liner. Formulation is top tier with their lip liners"

It’s a reddish brick MLBB shade, without being an in-your-face red. I’m very pleased with the result, it makes my lips look naturally full and pouty.   I do find the gloss a bit sticky - I tend to prefer glosses that have more slip, but fully realize the stickiness is what makes the color last on the lips so I’m not mad at it. I have other glosses that are very  sticky (such as MAC Lipglass or Bare Minerals Lip Lacquer) I never reach for those because I can’t stand how gross and sticky they are; the PMG lip gloss isn’t bad and I’m fine with wearing it all day. In fact I’m planning to purchase a couple more colors in the future. The color lasts a few hours on my lips as long as I don’t eat or drink, and also it has zero discernible scent or taste."

While not opaque, this is very pigmented. With lip glosses, I prefer a sheer color that I don't have to worry about escaping my lip line.   Dare to Bare: Pretty standard, very wearable, no-fuss warm nude.   Divine Rose: My favorite shade of any lip product ever, a wonderful cool toned dark-ish neutral that is the color I wished my lips were. I have bought this twice and used them up. I love it. You need it. Now. Buy it!  Sunset Rose: More neutral and peach than divine rose, a little lighter too. Wearable!  Pale Fire Nectar: Clear looking base with obvious pink sparkles. Super pretty, not gritty. I prefer to wear this over another lip product to give it that extra beauty.   Peach Perversion: Perfect summer shade! I love this one, it's a slightly pinker peachy nude and very sheer with a hint of shimmer (not glittery)"

It sheers out but gives a smooth and even application. It's thick enough to feel nourishing, but thin enough that it doesn't smear and transfer everywhere. It's not stringy, sticky, or goopy either. It's just a perfect lip gloss formula. I wish the packaging looked and felt more luxe for the price but with the performance I can't complain."

I also wanted something natural looking so I was trying to avoid glitter. I was definitely hesitant to spend $28 on a gloss, but I’m so glad that I did. It feels good and looks even better! I have finally found my holy grail. I started off with one to try and now I have three and want more! If you like this you will probably love Estee Lauder’s oil infused lip gloss/topper.

They do feel sticky... but they are lip glosses and that comes with the material. They don’t smudge and bleed either. The colors are so beautiful and they make your lips look spectacular (both on bare lips and over lipstick). They also stay on for a long time, resist liquid wear when you drink and leave a nice stain when faded. I guess I now am a lip gloss junkie!"

You’ll have to reapply of course but I don’t mind. I have Love Potion (cool pink nude), Dare to Bare (pale peachy nude) Aliengelic (clear flips pink), Astral Moon Flower (sheer blue with pinky/purple flip), Earth Angel (shimmer champagne nude), and Pale Fire Nectar (coral flips pink). It’s like picking between my favorite child honestly but I wear Love Potion a lot for work, Dare to Bare with smoky eyes, Earth Angel also for work, and Pale Fire Nectar screams summer. The only glosses I like as much are Surratt, but his are stickier (but will last longer due to this)."

The applicator is very nice, I have the uncommon opinion that I wish that the applicator carried less product on it!  I like less gloss on my lips, but most people would normally have a liquid lipstick underneath or bigger lips than me to cover and/or like a normal amount or heavy gloss coating unlike me.  I can just easily slide the applicator on the edge to help it out and my problem is solved.

My lips don’t feel dry or uncomfortable. Mega shine packed in a tube and totally worth the splurge!"

PERFECT AMOUNT OF OPACITY. It creates a smooth glassy finish. More importantly. THE COLOR. Since it isn’t purely opaque it lets the true colors of your lips shine through creating the most brilliant deep rose you have EVER SEEN. I honestly think this will look STUNNING on every skin tone.

It's like it kind of melts in a bit (hard to describe), not like some glosses which just have that weird sitting on top of your lips, thick sticky feeling. The pigment is rich.  When I first looked at the picture of Blood 2 on the lips, I was like...hmm they must be using it as a topper over lipstick. Nope!  It seriously looks JUST as red and lush on your lips as it does in the advertising.    If cool toned blue reds suit your skin tone- this is everything for you.  I also own Flesh 4 and Flesh 6.  Those have become my go to nude glosses.  (I'm a hazelnut chocolate shade, and they look SO good on me.)   I've received countless compliments this gloss.  Even my husband who is used to me in gloss, actually hit me with a Wow your lips look really good today. He notices it every time I wear any of the 3 shades I own.    But seriously if you're on the fence because of the price- try her lip gloss trios.  That's what I did and fell so in love I ended up buying the 3 shades I mentioned above. I will be purchasing a few more shades. These are a staple in my collection now."

The gloss felt juicy, smelled great, and was smooth and far from sticky. The glitter wore away naturally, not conflicting with any other colors I wanted to wear later.      It is a gloss, so it's probably not going to stay through a full meal, but you may get lucky -- honestly I'd believe it with this stuff.

I put this over a red lip to give me a glossy Marilyn Monroe pout and it’s my favorite lip topper I’ve ever tried. I always struggle with gloss over matte lip due to it running or being too liquidy of a gloss. This product just turns your lips into wet buttery gloss without running, getting too thick and weird on the lips... just straight up heavenly.

Her products are outstanding, both in quality, appearance, longevity, and experience of luxury. I am just so blown away by the brand. The astral glosses are my absolute favorite. They are stunning to look at and are unique and undupable. The blue and purple (available on her website) astrals are a lot more subtle on the lips. They add a slight sheen of blue (or purple) and are gorgeous when layered on top of her matteTrance lipsticks. Or any lipsticks for that matter. It'll turn your $5 drugstore lipstick into a spectacular and original shade. If you buy any of these glosses you must buy one of the astrals - it's so worth it. They last an incredibly long time and are a good value. And it doesn't look like glitter - just a very lovely shine. I am 44 years old and it doesn't look ridiculous - she sparkly and beautiful. Just be careful with the applicator - when the cylinder is brand new/full, sometimes the doefoot brings up a little extra gloss and it can splatter. This is particularly important with the Flesh4/6, darker, glosses."

I was completely GAGGED to find that it was a fully transparent high shine (like the level of shine that you get from literally a single SWIPE is insane the transformation exceeds explanation you just have to see it in person, I would recommend swatching in stores). When on the lips and out of the tube I didn't really get duochrome per se, but I DID get a gorgine pink-ish shimmer that complements my skin tone beautifully. The colour is somewhat similar to that of the Fenty Beauty Killawatt Foil highlighter in the shade sangria sunset, or they at least pair well. Do not concern yourself with the price tag; the shine lasts and so does this product. I find that using a simple lip balm like carmex or even just petroleum underneath really helps that shine stay glimmering for longer periods of time. I reapply like a madman (but thats because its a nervous habit at this point), and the tubes last me about 1.5ish months. Apply like a normal person and I have no doubt that this will last at least double that."

Those were the only colors of interest. It is loaded with shimmer! It has a sheer base and lots of shimmer that looks amazing in indoor and natural light. I like how you can build up the intensity. 2-3 coats is what I go for. It has a sweet smell, long wand, and sturdy tube. The lip gloss lasts a good amount of time. If your eating or drinking, you will need to touch it up more than a lipstick because it has a glossy (wet) formula. So of course it will wear off quickly when touched. When you do touch it up it doesn’t feel or look clumpy. It’s very comfortable and I love how it does not have a gritty feel. I don’t usually have that issue with the high end glosses I use in general. I want to touch on those concerned about sheerness. The ones with clear bases like Gold Allure, Blitz Gold, and Aliengelic aren’t “sheer” because they don’t have an opaque color base. For instance Paraphernalia is a pastel purple color and it is the only one I would consider sheer (you need 2x the coats- so like 4-5 coats) to build up the base color- purple. It does show up as light purple eventually but it’s a lot more work. I’m more of a gold lip gloss person. I will continue to buy Gold Allure, Blitz Gold, and Aliengelic. It’s definitely a quality lip gloss and has a thicker formula."

It sits on the lips so comfortably without feeling sticky or goopy. It adds a lovely glossy look with a pop of color."

It encourages (more like push) me to investigate everyone’s opinions… keep in mind this is just that, my opinion on the product. First I was so excited to receive the product, overly excited based off all the good reviews. However, the price tag is horrific for the quality – great for the color! ha-ha the color is the best part, it look very nice on my brown skin. The formula, I’m not so sure about. It was not loose, but defiantly not thick enough to last an hour, it dried up very fast I would say 45 mins and lost its shine. The smell- regular chocolatey. The packaging average eye catcher, the box it come in could be slimmer actually pretty big for the product. I over all appreciate the product, just not sure I will be buying this specific product from her line again.. maybe next time I will try the high lighter!"

The applicator is fabulous. This looks beautiful layered over other, more pigmented lip products but I had hopes that it would be pigmented enough to wear on its own. It just isn't. There was nowhere I could swatch this beforehand, so I ordered based on the photo and other reviews that said these glosses were pigmented. Maybe it depends on the color you choose?

It doesn't feel gritty at all like you'd suspect with all the reflect in it. It applies silky smooth. The only downside is that it doesn't wear for very long,although it wears down well. If it was more long wearing, it would be 5 stars. The price is steep, as is all of PM's products, but I would highly recommend (as with all of her products)."

This gloss also lasts along with the pretty sheer pink sparkly color for longer than any gloss I have that is not necessarily a lip topper. The applicator is perfect for the product and gets the right amount of gloss to my lips with one swipe top and bottom, plus it feels so good while you’re putting it on. I normally cannot wear pink lipstick or gloss, but this gives the hint of pink in a nude my lips need.  I love this gloss and when I get rich I will buy more, lol!"

The color Flesh Fantasy is a super pretty your-lips-but-better shade that is perfect for summer. The tube is super generous for the price. My only minor complaint (teeny tiny) is the applicator is flexible rather than fixed so it took a few applications to get used to, but I also like a very sharply defined lip.

I'd say the color is true to the photo. If you put on a lot it looks kind of metallic, but light handed it just looks sun kissed. I don't mind the sparkles. It's a good amount. If you're planning on kissing your boyfriend and eating, you might wear the gloss away and end up with some glitter. But to go out and wear it normal for a few hours or as a topper to a pale lipstick, it's great! And also with a tan, I love it."

Only reason I wouldn't give it five stars is to me there is nothing drop dead amazing about this lip gloss to spend $28 dollars on.

Except for I swatched Blood in the store and that one seems to have the craziest pigment of them all. But the more sheer pigment on the rest make all shades wearable without being crazy. Gorgeous mirror like shine. My absolute favorite thing about this lipgloss is that it wears off completely evenly, no weird color/white rings on the inside of the mouth either, no residue... what magic is this??! So this makes it easy to reapply! It does not bleed outside the lips at all! It feels like nothing on the lips no matter how many layers I put on, And my lips are so soft since I’ve been using it. In terms of how long it lasts: the pigment lasts for an hour on me, and the glossy look lasts forever, at least 3-4 hours which for a gloss is nuts. I like to reapply often for that gorgeous mirror shine and pigment, and I do not mind at all. What’s important is that it does not build residue after reapplying a few times, and that it does not feel heavy or sticky at all. Love this gloss and it has its own little special place in my collection compared to other high end brand glosses."

These glosses, especially the shine ones like aphrodisiac, smooth out your lips like no other... and thats saying something because I have very textured lips. I loved the color of both, aphrodisiac is the perfect everyday pink for my fair olive skin and aliengelic had a lot more personality to it than I expected-- the pink glitter really pops and makes it much more unique than your run of the mill gloss. The formula is unlike any other gloss I've tried: feels moisturizing, isn't sticky (unless you try to wipe it off or it wears almost completely off and you dont reapply), and it doesn't start to feel clumpy or goopy after being on your lips for awhile. I also love the large, curved doe-foot applicator-- the gloss smoothes easily across your lips. Its also worthwhile to say that I am a lipgloss hater/skeptic, I hate the stickiness and the fact that my hair is constantly getting stuck on my lips, but these glosses have changed my ways. I honestly can't see whats not to love, except for the fact that once you have one you'll want them all and your bank account will likely suffer."

I've tried many and for a while liked the Bite Lipglosses colors before they changed their color offerings. But the problem with their formula and many is that it was too sticky. Like gummy sticky.  I think of all the glosses you can't really fine something that won't ever be non sticky necessarily but this wears much more comfortably on the lips than other glosses that I've tried. The color goes well with my foundation color (Rainforest of the Sea: Light Medium Sand). Ugh, now I am tempted to get more from this brand."

Want something fun and bright pale nectar fire or twilo! Want something for every day? Bronze temptation or divine rose! These colors are glide on smoother than butter, are long lasting without being sticky and keep my lips so moisturizer! They don’t disturb your lipstick underneath either. I love to wear it on its own to show off the sparkle in some of the colors! Worth the price and a pocket friendly if you’re looking to try a pat McGrath product. You get a good amount too so that helps! Go for it!!!"

It’s a sheer gloss with a pink glitter that only truly shows in theatric lighting. The gloss itself is a medium-thick body, non sticky formula that I like. The large doe foot applicator is probably the best part of the packaging. Wouldn’t recommend for summer daytime use but more for going out at night. Isn’t as high impact as anticipated but I may try another color in the future. If you don’t have any glosses, try it! If you are a collector of gloss, you’ll probably still buy it but it will sit on the shelf."

It looks very beautiful in the tube and it swatches nicely on a hand, but once applied on the lips it just look meh. I mean it is beautiful, but nothing like online or hand swatches. It has a nice wet/glass finish. It is not very pigmented and the shade looks too sheer on the lips by itself. Unless you layer and layer and layer. I had to redip 3 times to get a nicer more opaque color, but at that point it becomes too wet looking, almost as if you swiped oil on your lips. It is ok when used on top of a lipstick, but still doesn’t look as I was hoping to, so I’m not keeping it.  Though it is a light, nice lip gloss that would work fine if I wasn’t looking for a specific color/look."

Lipgloss, however, is always iffy (especially with such a colour). I am BEYOND impressed with this lipgloss. It has amazing colour payoff and the colour is extremely brightly pigmented. I love this lipgloss, I would get the whole range if I could."

Divine Rose is the perfect my-lips-but-better shade for me with just a hint of shimmer. Aliengelic is such a WOW for a clear gloss. It looks like a gloss version of my Rituel de Fille Ara eye soot."

I am a fan of so many features of this product... color, brush applicator, quality (not sticky and feels light on the lips) and the amount of product in the tube.  It also looks great layered over other creme/matte lipsticks.  The only negative for me is the price but it is Pat McGrath and to be expected from this line.  I can see why every tube is sold out!"
