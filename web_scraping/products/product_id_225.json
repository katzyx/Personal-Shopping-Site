I couldn't help but laugh as I went in store looking for something to help my chapped lips and was told by the consultant this was the go to product.  So, I naively purchased it.

I still love my Laneige, but now I also love this one. The Cay Skin lip mask has no smell or flavor to it. It is very nourishing and feels good on the lips. It is also thicker just like the Laneige one, but this one has a little more slip to it. It is also long lasting. I use these lip masks during the day also, so they are very versatile for me. Cay Skin, please make this lip mask with some scents and flavors also. Sometimes I love to have some fruity lippies on me. :)"

I always check labels and did check this label before I purchased, so I didn’t see anything that was even mildly suspicious to me. When I returned the item, the sales associate immediately said it’s probably the sea moss. I have no idea if that’s the issue or not, just a heads up to anyone else who may be trying this."

I’m pleased with the generous amount. If I had to pick one thing, I wish this came in a tube with an applicator similar to the SPF one. I want to take this with me on the go all day long but I don’t want the container to get nasty. I also got the SPF lip moisturizer, the two are a bit different. The SPF one doesn’t taste quite as good as the lip mask.With all that said, this is still a 5 star product and is worth every penny. I will definitely be buying some more of this!

This Cay Skin lip mask is it but even better I might dsay??? I I use it at night and even after washing my face in the morning my lips still feel so soft and hydrated throughout the day.
