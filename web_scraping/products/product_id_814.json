It’s a great treat yourself every now and then type of hair treatment before you get in the shower; not some thing I would use every day but some thing I would use 2 to 4 times a month as an extra treat for my hair. I will continue to purchase this product because I really do think it makes a difference in my hair. I was not paid for this review and these words are my own.

I massaged it in and let it sit to work its magic for 15 minutes before getting into the shower.  I had no issues washing it out even though the directions said you may need to shampoo twice.  The great news is this stuff really works.  My scalp is no longer itchy.  I am using it weekly to keep my scalp healthy and moisturized.  If you have an itchy scalp give this product a try.

The new version, I absolutely adore though. It's more oily than the old one, so I have had to wash my hair twice when using it, which is why I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5. It smells a little citrus-y, whereas the old one had no distinct smell. I really like the new scent. But my hair! After using this, my hair was just so soft and it even helped with frizz.

I did have to wash my hair three times to get the oil off, which I didn't particularly like, but my scalp did feel great afterwards. The minus one star comes from the fact that the next day my head was way to oily. This could have also been due to the extreme heat here in Texas. I don't really notice a big difference between the formulas and I will continue to use it and update my review. Thanks JVN Hair for sending me the free product.   I also have to add that anytime I use JVN products, air dry cream or Instant Recovery serum, the shampoo, etc. I always get compliments on my hair!

JVN states that the residue is due to the turmeric powder settling over time.  Now they’re using turmeric oil.   I can feel the difference in just the first use.  After the first shampoo, my hair didn’t feel stringy when rinsing.  It felt softer and supple.  After the 3rd shampoo/rinse, it felt slightly stringy, but not as much as the previous formula. I also felt my shampoo was able to clean my scalp better with this new formula.  It seems my shampoo, which has argan oil, was able to mix better with this new formula when massaging my scalp; therefore, rinsing was easier.   I’m rooting for this new formula.  My hair feels softer and cleaner with it.   (in the pic, the bottle on the left is the new formula, the bottle on the right is the old formula. You can see the color difference, which hopefully means a better emulsion of the turmeric. )"

I am so grateful to feel like I have some control back over my hair growth and quality.  As a bonus, my hair feels softer and stronger in general.   I was worried that it would be a hassle to use, but it really feels like such a self-care moment. I have come to appreciate how it slows me down and gives me time to massage my scalp and sort of reconnect with myself during a busy day when I'm usually rushing around to get ready.   And I really love how trustworthy the ingredient list is and the knowledge that JVN is such an environmentally-conscious company.  The complete scalp oil is such a simple yet effective part of my hair routine... I can't believe I went so long without it! I'm on my 2nd bottle at home, and always bring the sample size along when I travel."

I recently got highlights around my face and this oil really makes them POP! The color of the oil is slightly darker than the previous formula (I had a bottle with a little bit left in it so I could compare it) but I don't think that change in color affects the product or the result in any way. It still works like before, and I'm going to continue using it to see if any long-term benefits have improved.

I apply this oil (3 droppers) and then go wild with a scalp massager, wait 15 minutes, then double wash + condition my hair and WOW. My scalp feels so much cleaner, and as a bonus I've got more volume from the roots and my hair is softer than when I use shampoo+conditioner only. I've been using the old formula for a year and a half and was sent the new formula last week to try out.

It recommends leaving on for 10-15 minutes. I applied, taking time to massage my scalp and gently scratch with my fingernails. Then, I sat down and read a book! I took time out for 15 minutes to just relax and read a book and let this oil work its magic. Yes, this oil is moisturizing, yes, it nourishes your scalp, no it is not greasy but more than all of these obvious things, it gave me a time to truly relax. Don't waste this time staring at your device. Read a book, lay down in shavasana, sing! Whatever it is that makes you feel cared for, do it, while you use this treatment oil"

The hemisqualane is also very nourishing. I have dry patches around my hairline and notice they flake less when I use this product. I would like a squeeze bottle with a nozzle for more precise application. The dropper and glass bottle can be a little cumbersome to manage. Overall, it's worth a try and a nice addition to level up a wash day routine."

I had experienced some mild flaking which was more noticeable because of my dark hair, but I have not noticed any flakes since using this product. I've also notice a bit less hair loss and breakage which is a great bonus."

I was a little skeptical of using a hair oil on my very fine hair. most oils usually weigh my hair down and are hard to wash off. not this one! I have to use an anti dandruff shampoo in my routine, which helps my scalp but leaves my hair all dry and frizzy. JVN Pre wash oil not only cleared up the build up, it made my hair so soft and manageable. I really like it so far :)"

I’ve used the oil for a few months now, and apply every other day and leave on for a bit longer than the recommend time. It has helped reduce the amount of hair fall and breakage when I brush and wash my hair, and helps with my occasionally itchy scalp. I have naturally oily hair, and this oil surprisingly helps make my hair feel extra clean when I wash it which helps stretch my time between washes to every other day instead of daily."

I massage it in to my scalp and let it sit for 15 minutes before showering. I was pleasantly surprised that this oil not oily soothes my scalp but clarifies and hydrates it. After the second use, I noticed fewer flakes and less scalp itching. My hair also feels softer and looks shinier. This is definitely being added to my hair care routine!"
