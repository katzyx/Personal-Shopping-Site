I do feel as though my hair has had a bit more volume but what I love is that it hasnâ€™t changed the texture or consistency of my hair in the process. My hair is very fine and almost completely straight, and I want volume but usually forgo volumizing products because of the grittiness or almost dirty Feeling when I use them. But using this concentrate in conjunction with the shampoo and conditioner has given me a great result."
