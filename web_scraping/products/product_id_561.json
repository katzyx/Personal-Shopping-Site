			"review_text": "Review for GHD Platinum+ Styler  I am extremely disappointed with my GHD Platinum+ Styler 1‚Äù, which I purchased on October 27, 2022, from Sephora Canada. After just over two years of careful use, the styler completely stopped working, showing a red beeping light and refusing to turn on. For a product with such a high price tag and strong reputation, I expected far better quality and durability.  What makes this even more frustrating is the warranty process. If you‚Äôre in North America, you‚Äôre required to pay for shipping to the U.S. to have the styler repaired or replaced under warranty. And if you‚Äôre out of warranty, your only option is to throw it away, as there‚Äôs no other recourse.  For a brand that markets itself as premium, this is incredibly disappointing. Not only did the product fail far too soon, but the hassle and expense of dealing with the issue make it even worse. I trusted GHD to deliver quality and reliability, but after this experience, I would not recommend their products. Save your money and invest in a brand that stands by their products and offers better customer service."

First, quality: This straightener feels cheaper and flimsier than it should for the price. & Not that it matters, but the start-up sound is also somehow worse (rattly like a kids toy almost). The cord is not substantial, and barely weighs enough to make the swivel actually move to prevent getting it tangled.   As others have said: there are gaps between the plates, and if you have fine hair, it WILL get caught and stuck in there. (Perfectly sized, horizontal sections can prevent this... but you're out of luck if you use this to curl / style at an angle).   Performance: Quick to heat up, leaves a nice shine. Curved edge is effective (if you avoid getting hair caught). I would not consider this to cause heat damage.   For reference, I have a ton of fine-medium hair to my mid-back that is chemically straightened."

I‚Äôve always used straighteners from the drugstore, so this was my first experience using a higher end, more expensive hair tool. For reference, I have naturally wavy, somewhat frizzy hair, and I occasionally like to straighten my hair. While I did not find it easier or faster to straighten my hair with this tool, I did notice a huge difference in the end result of how my hair looked after using it. When I‚Äôve straightened my hair with other straighteners, my hair usually ends up frizzing up and forming slight waves again after a few hours. I didn‚Äôt notice this at all with the ghd. My hair stayed completely sleek, silky and straight until the next time I washed it. I have to say that it is highly effective as a straightener, but I wouldn‚Äôt use it in place of a curling iron. It did an okay job of adding waves to the ends of my hair, but I found it quite difficult to use for curling the full length of my hair. Maybe I just need to try a different method, but beware that there is a learning curve if you want to use it for curling. As a straightener though, I highly recommend it only if you have the money to spare."

I was amazed at the tool the color limited edition, sound on bleep, and light. Also included were heat proof plate guards, so convenient! The straightening was even and worked well. Frizziness was lessened and curling was what I want and expect from a tool. My hair looked thick, shiny, healthy, and not stressed from overheating. This smart Styler was easy to use, smaller width-wise but I can take this everywhere, and still have the results I want. This style reaches required temp in 20 seconds so time is on our side with this ghd styler! Alongside the benefits to my hair, this Styler has three safety features. The wishbone hinge and rounded barrel create a snag free easy approach to getting ready, apparently somebody noticed the hurdles we go through to get ready! I can do different styles, waves and curls with this one tool. Although it took two to three passes in my hair for the straightening that I need, the benefits outweigh the drawbacks with this styler."

I have exclusively used a CHI for at least 10 years and have never thought to purchase a new one as I thought it was the ‚Äúit‚Äù flatiron to have. Boy was I wrong! This flatiron somehow smooths my hair while also straightening. My hair feels softer after flat ironing than it did before and I love it! I also feel that it takes fewer passes to straighten my hair. The flatiron is also very pretty and sleek looking as well as lightweight. I like that it comes with a rubber cover to cover the endplates. The only con I have found about this flatiron is that it plays a little tune when turning it on and off. When I am getting ready in the morning while my husband is sleeping, I don‚Äôt really like this feature as I don‚Äôt want it to wake him up. Otherwise, it doesn‚Äôt really bother me. I love this flatiron and it has now replaced my trusty CHI!"

So it makes this magical princess like melody when it turns on (hold the interior on button for 3 seconds, don't just tap it once) and again when it turns off. This is actually smart and safer becuase some folks may think they turned off their flat iron when they didn't so the sound makes it more obvious. I admire the white color, love white over color just becuase it matches with everything. The plate is typical one inch which is ideal but I prefer a longer plate. This did straighten my hair beautifully and effortlessly. Typically I would go over my hair multiple times to get it straight straight but with this it was just 3 times which means less hair damage people. loooonnnggg plug in cord, unnecessary for me but I'm always close to home and never traveling so. Turns hot within seconds! No need to wait forever for it to warm up. Saves time. Great quality. Nice size."

It‚Äôs usually because I washed my hair the night before and was too tired to blow it out which happens.  üòÇ  I used a detangling spray on my damp hair after washing and let it air dry.  I slept with my air dried hair up in a loose top knot. For reference, my hair is at about a 2c, is thick stubborn and very prone to frizz. It‚Äôs also color treated all over along with balayage highlights.  That mess you see is usually the state of my hair before I style it in the morning. I plugged it in and pressed the power button located in the inner portion of the flat iron.  The button lit up and made a sound indicating that it is on.  The light indicated that it was ready for use instantly which was a surprise to me.  This styling tool seemed very ergonomically designed and felt good around my hand, causing me not to strain my wrists which suffers from carpal tunnel syndrome.  It was also weighted but not heavy. Before using the ghd Platinum +, I sectioned my hair and sprayed each section with a heat protectant right before I passed it with the flat iron.  My main observations during usage was that the flat iron was not incredibly hot like some previous ones I have used even in or around the temperature that the ghd platinum + remains in (365 degrees) and my hair cools down to the touch after each pass almost immediately.  There was no sizzle and smoke coming out of my hair so it was incredibly gentle in heat but took only two passes to achieve the results I wanted.  The hair straighteners that I‚Äôve used in the past took higher heat and more passes to get my hair straight which I know definitely causes major damage in my already vulnerable color treated hair.  It took me about 25 mins to finish my entire head of hair when I normally take about 30-40 mins with other flat irons which was a very pleasant surprise.  After usage, I applied hair oil to my mid lengths and ends for"

I was pleasantly surprised when I plugged the flat iron in and turned it on to find that it took less than a minute to heat up. I like that this styling iron automatically heats up to an optimal styling temperature so I wasn‚Äôt as worried to use it on my bleached hair. I naturally have very straight hair, this styler did a good job at decreasing frizz and making my hair look super shiny and smooth. I cannot stand when there are buttons on the outside of styling irons because I tend to touch one and the iron will turn off or I‚Äôll increase/decrease the temperature on accident.. So I really like how there is only one button on the inside and I don‚Äôt have to worry about hitting other buttons unintentionally while I‚Äôm styling my hair. Definitely recommend!"

This brand was well researched by me a few years ago but I went with a CHI in the same price range and honestly I just told my mom she can have my old CHI because I‚Äôm switching to this one full time !! I straighten my hair most days as it‚Äôs a weird texture that doesn‚Äôt hold a curl AT ALL so I‚Äôm always on the lookout for good products. I paired this with CHI ironguard 44 and Verb ghost oil and my hair is flawless for going on three days. Love that the plates are ‚Äútight‚Äù in the machine so it doesn‚Äôt pinch my hair, the plates looked a little short to me at first but didn‚Äôt affect any styling. Best part is the auto temperature as I always put my CHI too high and fried my hair lol seriously 10/10 and the price is super reasonable for the product you receive !"

The tool gives the most beautiful curls. There is definitely a learning curve. I took me a couple tries. My hair is flat and the curls I got from the tools were effortless and gave my hair volume. They were even holding up on the second day. The tool is round on the edges to give the most beautiful curls. I also tried to straighten my hair and the iron did an amazing job.  The tool has a predictive technology monitor for temperature control build in. It definitely works, because I had less heat on certain parts of my hair. It did an amazing job straightening and curling.   I would purchase the ghd platinum plus because it did an amazing job with the curls which I did not expect.  It is easy to travel with it because the tool is small and doesn't take up much space and it's lightweight. I can highly recommend it to anyone that is thinking about purchasing it."

I LOVED the way that this straightener made my hair look and feel afterward. My hair did not feel brittle or damaged. It completely eliminated the frizz, and I did not have to go over the same spot several times to get my desired look. The way this straightener operates is next level genius! I will be giving away my old ( other name brand) straightener and make this my new go to. I would highly recommend this straightener."

Not only is this the best straightener i've ever used, but it's the best curler too (better waves than my NuMe wand). I was a little hesistant about the temperature limit (I usually crank it to 410), but this straightener does wonders! It heats up in two seconds and I don't feel the need to have it hotter at all. Long story short, I'm in love. I've read other reviews that theirs broke within a year.. hoping thats not the case. But if it is- I'm going to just buy a new one lol."

For me, it works great! I do have fine hair, and it doesn't fry it sizzle or make me feel like it's taking forever. It's apparently designed to not snag your hair in the wand, though I did get my fine hair caught once or twice, not a huge deal though and not horribly snagged either.

I think this is the softest my hair has ever felt. i find myself touching it all day long when i straighten it and i never did that before.  this straightener gets the perfect amount of hot, it isn't sizzling my hair but it is straightening it even better than my chi!"

I‚Äôm telling you, this iron makes your hair healthier actually it uses less heat and somehow does a better job than any iron I‚Äôve ever used! I have wavy color damaged hair and I usually have to take at least 6 different times before my hair is straight and I can move on to the next section with this iron I literally had to do it one time ONLY with this iron and I did t have to use any serum! My niece is bi-racial and I used it on her hair so that I could see if this straightener was really all it was cracked up to be and it IS! It works for ALL hair types! Perfectly, no serum, less time to do my hair more time for other things. This flat iron goes right through my wavy color damaged hair one time with little to no effort! I love it! My friends are all begging to use it but I won‚Äôt let it out of my sight but I will donate all of my Chi‚Äôs and all other flat irons I‚Äôve got! I love this one so much I don‚Äôt need any of them anymore! I‚Äôve finally found something that works! Might I add that it saves money on Power because it only takes like 2 minutes to heat up and then it‚Äôs good to go! I received this from Influentster but I‚Äôd still buy it with my own money if I was allowed to use it once!"

So I watched a ton of tutorials for this specific model....my hair curled...for like 2 seconds. By the time I got to the top layer, the bottom layer was almost completely straight. I ended up only being able to get any curl to stay in by applying a ton of product...and then it just looked bad. When I tried to use it for straightening, the plates made indents near my roots as it's hard to get close to the root.... I even thought I might just be having a bad hair day...but no, I plugged my old babyliss in and everything curled (and stayed in) fine.

It also works great for curling hair, loose bouncy curls. No reservations on recommendation. I just hope it lasts longer than the Gold Styler.

Every time I plug it in, I get a red light and beeping or it‚Äôll make the noise like it‚Äôs heating up then some sort of beeping will come on until I turn it off. I‚Äôve tried every single plug in my bathroom, room, everywhere. I have a $300 straightener that I literally cannot use. I‚Äôve emailed the company MULTIPLE times and get the same automatic response every time - to send it back, but I have to pay for shipping to the US and I will be without a straightener for 2 + weeks. Even though I‚Äôve sent the company videos of the issues. I‚Äôve had to buy a cheap straightener off Amazon, just so I can send this thing back.  I should have done more research first because once I experienced this issue, I googled it and it‚Äôs a common issue. I straighten my hair everyday and I wanted to upgrade to a good straightener that would last me a very long time so I figured this was a higher price for higher quality... or so I thought. PLEASE do research before buying this product so you don‚Äôt end up with a $300 paper weight like me."

But it's no better than a $30 hair straightener from any big box store. It snags and catches my hair. There's a ton of frizz and flyaways. I'm using Bumble and Bumbles primer, Olaplex styling products and Moraccan Oils leave in conditioner. A hundred dollars or more of specialty products. So I was thinking I should have better results than a high schooler with a generic straightener. But no. Honestly, I'm left wondering if this is even an authentic product or if I got a knock off from Sephora because this is no where close to what I expected from the price point or popularity of this straightener. I'm returning it."

Honestly, I've been using this straightener for a few months now and it actually does feel like it's healthier for my hair. It glides across each strand so smoothly & doesn't snag any of it. I only have to do one pass to get it super straight. I can't explain it, it just feels like it's healthier for my hair.   My favorite thing about this flat iron is that it easily adds any type of curl or wave and allows me to get super straight and shiny hair without extra heat. It only reaches 365 but feels the same as if I were using a straightener that reaches 450.   I have a full review and demo of this flat iron on youtube.

It also does not have a temperature dial. For reference I have wavy, frizzy, medium-to-thick hair (Italian descent). I ended up giving it to a friend and I'm back in the market for another.   If you have thick hair or lots of hair and need a bit more heat in your tools, this probably won't be the holy grail for you. The search continues for me."

This straightener died on me about a year and a half after purchasing it. I was not overusing it, I only used it roughly 1-2 times per week for about 2 minutes (I have straight medium fine hair).   The quality of the straightener was nothing special. I found it almost made my hair greasier than my other straighteners, and pulled a little on the hair too much.   Would not recommend. Would not purchase this brand again. You‚Äôre better off going to Marshall‚Äôs or winners to find a better version that will last longer."

However, I found that it snagged my hair ALOT, but it did smooth it nicely. I worried about damage because of the snagging. I stumbled up on the GHD, and decided to give it a try. OMG!!! It is amazing. I was hesitant to spend this money on a flat iron with only 1 heat setting. I love how quickly this straightens my hair with what feels like zero effort and minimal damage. I was worried that only one heat setting would not be able to straighten my hair. I was wrong. I just do a couple passes and I am finished. My hair is left smooth and soft with no snagging or burnt hair smell. I recommend this for anyone but especially for those with coarse, curly, and color-treated hair, since our hair is already more vulnerable to heat damage. I also used this to curl my hair, which I NEVER did with a flat iron and the curls turned out beautiful. Before this purchase, I was considering the Dyson Corrale, but I think I just saved myself some money because this is an incredible tool!"

The plates pull up my hair when I‚Äôm sliding it through even though they feel smooth to the touch. And what‚Äôs worse is that the wishbone handle does not help the plates push together flush at all!   I‚Äôve included a picture to show that the center of the plates touch and not the top or bottom edges. No matter how I wiggle them up or down while heated.   the top and bottom of the plates do not touch. This is actually causing her to fall out of the top of the iron when I glide it through where I normally might encounter this problem at the very bottom of the iron plates.   Its bulky head, weight and the fact that the top and bottom of the plates don‚Äôt touch make it really hard to do any fine detailed smoothing around my roots or front of my face and to move sections of hair evenly through the plates. I didn‚Äôt bother trying to curl with this...  with my fine hair it should be pretty easy to get a smooth iron like this to work well but this thing sucks. Maybe coarse or thick hair would be more forgiving of its deficiencies in design.  Hard pass."

There‚Äôs only one heat setting and it works really well for my hair. I love how quickly this product heats up. It comes with a heat protective cap for travel. It has auto shut off. CONS: there‚Äôs only one heat setting which some people may not like. The white design isn‚Äôt too easy to keep clean. When I create waves or curls, there is a bit of frizz that comes with it. The price is insanely high."

As other reviews have shown the plates do not touch, and as another review wrote, shame on you GHD.Having read this in the reviews I also noticed this on the floor sample in the store but I decided to try it anyway. I had to squeeze the handle extra hard to get a good pass through - it actually started to hurt during the first use. Very disappointing. You would think an engineer somewhere would have figured out this is a flaw. Also, the hinge does not open far enough, there is a very narrow space with which to grab the hair. I don't know why it is so hard to come up with an ergonomically friendly flat iron that does not damage your hair too much. If the technology has not been discovered so far, maybe that means we should not be using a product like this on our hair, haha."

It also hasn‚Äôt snagged at all yet, which the classic did a lot. I like that it comes with a cover to protect the hot plates from touching anything while it cools down.   The one thing that was weird was the grip. At first it felt like my hand was sliding forward on the styler but  now I‚Äôve figured it out. It takes a few times of use to used to it.   Some people complained that the plates don‚Äôt touch and they are not supposed to. They do not need to clamp down on your hair to get good results. And it‚Äôs better for your hair if they don‚Äôt.   Overall, I really love this product, but would say the classic is a great choice too if you want to save $100."

It heats up quickly, and looks great. the hinge mechanism is one of the best I've ever tried, extremely sturdy and as it says, the plates always remain aligned. I already have nearly pin straight hair and mainly use this to remove ponytail lines or if I slept on it funny, or to flatten occasional layers I don't like - it works quickly and easily.   One big issue I've had with this since the beginning is that it just doesn't feel like my hair glides through the plates very well. It has always felt very sticky, to the point where I've never used it to curl my hair since it sticks so badly. It's definitely the plates, not product I'm using. I've also been getting the red light on it since my first couple months owning it, which comes on when it's having trouble regulating the temperature. I find that by unplugging it and plugging it back in it goes away. After 2.5 years I also find my hair is now getting caught in the edges of the plates and pulling. I've just bought the BioIonic 10x and so far love the vibration which gets my hair through extremely smoothly with no stickiness or pulling.  2.5 years ago this was one of the best on the market. I wouldn't suggest buying it now though as I think there are better options."

It does seem to have a little (?) less heat than my last flat iron but it works like a charm and hopefully is better for my hair. I have used this iron pretty much every day for 4 years now and it still works perfectly. I can also curl the ends of my hair with it quite easily because of the curved barrel (my fav look to hide damaged ends), which is great because I never have to buy a curling iron.

The speaker sounds really cheap for such an expensive product. I will say this is a little tough to curl hair with. You just have to make sure you turn through your hair slowly so it can heat evenly through all of your hair. I attribute this to the lower heat that allows less damage to your hair. I love that this straightener also comes with a cover to keep it closed and protect the product. When I straighten my hair with this iron I don‚Äôt feel like I am pulling at the strands in my hair, which is very appreciated!  All in all I feel this iron is a bit overpriced, but it does a great job heat styling with little damage to hair. I received this product complimentary for testing purposes."

My main issue with previous straighteners is the metal plate getting caught/pulling on my hair and so far I haven't experienced this with this straightener! I also love how fast I can straighten my hair with this styler (~5 mins) so perfect for someone that's always on the go. I also tested this on a friend with extremely curly hair and it took less than 30 mins until she had pin straight hair when usually it would take an hour! Overall, this is an extremely nice styler and gives you better than salon results! However, it is very pricey and I believe that there are cheaper straighteners out there that'll give you results that are just as good!"

So it became inconvenient at some point and i stop using it for more than 1 year.   Now some times it works very well. Sometimes it does.  This is the only thing its bother me.

It does not straighten curly hair well, although you would assume so with the platinum plates. I liked it to style my hair the day after I straightened it, but I would definitely not recommend it solely as a straightener. Because of the texture of my hair, I would not purchase this tool unless I had money to blow. Just not a realistic product for me, since I already have styling tools that work better. A main factor for me was the lack of heat adjustment. Also, it was hard to figure out if it was on, had automatically turned off, or was already off."

I've noticed that my ends are considerably less damaged than before and I can therefore (though I shouldn't) go longer between trims. I have long, coarse hair with a bit of wave in it and mostly use a straightener so that my hair doesn't 'puff up' as it dries, so take that as you will. What I am NOT a fan of is that my hair gets caught in the plates sometimes. I also wish that there was somewhat of a temperature control, as I really think this needs to get hotter to really straighten more than just wavy hair. I think because this isn't an option, that might be why my ends are better, but I'm not convinced that's the only reason. In the end, I wouldn't repurchase. I'm happy I have it, because it taught me that investing in my hair tools pays off, but there's probably better out there."

The styler does not get hot enough to keep my hair wavy. I have never had this issues with my old straightener or when using my friends. My waves would typically last until I washed my hair.

			"review_text": "To start, I received this flatiron via the Influenster program for testing purposes. Here are my thoughts.   Packaging: I'm a sucker for good packaging and this flatiron felt luxurious and nicely designed. Very polished and well built. I didn't worry about the flatiron being damaged in any way as it was secure and well protected. The flatiron itself looks very sleek and of good quality. It fits in my hand comfortably even though it's larger than my current flatiron.   I was fascinated by the built-in temp control. I wasn't sure how it would be able to adjust to my hair and not be too hot. I think it's pretty cool but felt like it was always a bit too hot for my hair. It always steamed while I used it. Though, I've never used a flatiron of this caliber before, so it could be me holding it to my hair a bit too long.   The iron has one button and makes a sound when activated. Which is kind of great for those who leave irons on by accident as this one has a verbal confirmation it's on, up to temp, and off. This guy gets up to temp quick. When I say quick, I mean like 10 seconds or less. It glides across the hair really nicely and my hair doesn't get caught on anything weird.   I have fine, thin hair, so it doesn't take much to make it straight. This iron does it quickly but doesn't stand out as different from my normal flatiron. On the flipside, I use my iron to curl my hair and this one makes great curls with lots of volume. Which surpasses my old iron by a lot as the curls hold all day.   Overall, it's a quality item with a unique feature. Which I do really like, but do wonder if it's worth having zero control over the tempurate as it seems to run hot for my hair type. It's also really pricy. I'm fortunate that I was given it for review, but otherwise, I could live without it."

			"review_text": "You guys, finally there‚Äôs a straightener that forces me to actually take care of my hair. I‚Äôve had insanely curly hair my whole life, and one of my favorite things to do is straighten it. The problem is that I always turn my straightener up to the hottest temperature it will go to, and I end up frying my hair. I thought that because of my curls, I needed the heat up that high. Then i was introduced to the ghd platinum , and I realized I WAS WRONG. First of all, the sound this straightener makes when you turn it on makes me feel like I‚Äôm the richest girl alive, it‚Äôs so cute. Second, this thing heats all the way up in SECONDS. When I heard the beep I was like, NO WAY, and I tested it on my hair and BAM, it worked. This straightener is amazing and sleek. It didn‚Äôt pull out my hairs and no hairs got stuck in the sides of the plates (which always happens to me). Really, this straightener has changed my life. The only downside is it takes a litlleeeeee longer to straighten my hair than it used to. But to save my hairs strength, color, and durability, it‚Äôs worth it. I received this item for free in order to review it."

Since I‚Äôve used the Ghd styler a little other a month now my hair has never felt better! My stylist even noticed an obvious difference when i went to see him, I had no split ends!!! The ghd styler adds both volume and shine to the hair, unlike other hair tools I used in the past the styler makes my hair feel so soft and fluffy. I normally use a straightener to create beachy waves in my hair, this styler has been the best for creating those! I‚Äôve been getting compliments everywhere I go.  I highly recommend this product!"

I reluctantly started my search for a new straightener. At first, I thought I might just purchase the same one as before, but I decided to branch out and consider upgrading my straightener to one that was more expensive and modern. After lots of research, I finally decided on the GHD Platinum  Professional Performance.   On my first use of the straightener, I was blown away by how fast it heated up, how quickly it straightened, and how SHINY my hair looked. I always knew that the quality of the straightener makes a difference on the results, but since my previous one was also for professionals, I thought I was already getting the best results. I was wrong! This straightener is a serious upgrade. It is so, so silky smooth on the hair. It never 'catches', it just slips over like butter. One pass straightens my hair perfectly. I was initially concerned that there is no temperature dial, but honestly, this straightener doesn't need it for my hair type (2A/2B). My hair looks so shiny, so glossy, and so healthy when I am finished styling.   If you are considering this straightener, I highly recommend. I have noticed significant results after using it, and I used other professional straighteners for years. It heats up so fast, glides over the hair effortlessly, and leaves it soft and shiny. My hair has never looked so good!"

I can‚Äôt speak to how long it lasts being that I‚Äôve only had it about a week or so, but I highly recommend based of the quality."

			"review_text": "I bought this to replace a 6-year-old BioIonic One Pass. The One Pass still technically works, but I've always HATED it and don't understand the positive reviews. The silicone strip pulled my hair and damaged it -- until it fell out and the sharp metal gap yanked my hair and tore it apart. My hair stylist uses a GHD and my hair always looks so healthy when he cuts and straightens it, so I got tired of having damaged hair I decided to get my own GHD. So far, I love it! The plates are super smooth and glide so easily -- which really cuts down on the damage. My hair has looked infinitely better since I switched over to the GHD Platinum . It heats up insanely fast and definitely gets hot enough to straighten thick wavy/curly hair like mine. Some people complained that the plates don't touch. Mine do, so if you get one that doesn't, then I'd suggest exchanging yours. All in all, I'm very happy with my purchase and would easily recommend GHD over BioIonic."

I have very thick curly bleached hair and this straightener has cut the time it takes me to do my hair in half. It is very gentle and does not pull, it also doesn‚Äôt fry my hair. I usually straighten my hair and use dry shampoo on it for a few days and it stays pin straight. It‚Äôs also very durable, I‚Äôve dropped it twice and it still works (haha). I have been getting so many compliments on my hair whenever I use it. It makes your hair look like you got a professional blow out. Stop wasting your money trying other straighteners, splurge a little and get the best one you can get! I received this product for testing purposes from influenster!"

There‚Äôs only one button to turn it on and off. At first I was worried because I usually put my old straightener to 410 degrees but this straightener took less than 15 seconds to warm up fully (the straightener makes a noise when it turns on, heats up all the way and turns off) and it definitely was hot enough for me hair! Only downfall I would say is the price is a little expensive but it‚Äôs worth it!"

Do your research. Look on all places they are sold. Most of the reviews talk about how it will break, especially their own website.
