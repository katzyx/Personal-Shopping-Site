I didn’t give 5 stars just because it doesn’t exceed the blushes I already have. BUT it’s still equally as good!"

			"review_text": "Hands down— Gucci Beauty has made the best blush I’ve ever worn. It’s hard to believe this is the brand’s first blush. Literally the creamiest powder blush I’ve ever used. Because I’ve been tanning recently, I chose 09 Intense Plum & I’m so happy I did. I’m obsessed with the shade. It’s pretty both sheer & bold. More speaking, Gucci blush is very buildable. Even better, this blush blends very easily; almost melting into the skin like butter. I’ve included swatches of Intense Plum— the left showing one layer & the right showing two. With & without flash. In addition to being creamy & blendable, the formula of this blush is extremely hydrating while maintaining a matte finish. Also, the packaging is super cute & includes a mirror making it travel friendly, which is awesome. Before deciding how much I loved this blush, I wore Gucci blush during a night out & also at work while exerting physical labor. I noticed it was much longer lasting than I originally assumed it would be. Even after sweating for a bit with a sheer application, it still looked fresh— closely resembling being naturally flushed. The only downside is the price point as it may seem a bit steep to the budget friendly makeup girlies. But I promise, it’s worth it. All in all, I definitely recommend this blush to anyone who appreciates great, high-end makeup products!"

			"review_text": "The Gucci Blush de Beauté in Intense Plum feels like the perfect mix of old-school glam and modern elegance. The packaging is stunning—light pink and gold with such a chic, girly vibe. It’s the kind of compact you actually want to show off, not just toss in your bag. The shade Intense Plum is everything—super pigmented, so you only need a little for a soft, everyday look, but it builds beautifully for a bold, dramatic vibe. The texture is smooth and blends like a dream on both cheeks and eyelids. No scent, which is a big win for me. It’s honestly such a luxe product, and I can’t wait to try the other shades!"

Personally, it is hard to find blushes that suit my skin but this is almost a perfect shade for me since it blends well in with my contour and bronzer!"

You do not have to use a lot to achieve a nice rosy cheek, but this blush is definitely buildable if you like more color coverage. With the small amount needed to achieve the look I like, this blush is going to last me quite some time!"

I finally got to try it and can say that it definitely lives up to the hype.   The formula is smooth, blendable, and buildable. You can create a subtle or more intense look, depending on the occasion and your likes. My makeup artist suggested I try the peach shade and she was so right, it is really flattering for most complexions! It adds this touch of warmth, which is great for the cold winters! I know the price might be a bit high since it is a luxurious product, but the well-pigmented formula and stunning packaging are worth it, if in your budget, especially if you like luxurious items.  I'm planning on adding more shades to my collection soon! I really loved this!!"

I purchased 01-Silky Rose earlier this year and found that it is too bright and surprisingly too cool in color for me.  I was disappointed, because I don't think any of the other permanent colors would work for me if 01-Silky Rose didn't (02-Tender Apricot would definitely be too orange for me, and 05-Rosy Beige looks like it would be too gray).  I was incredibly excited to see 10-Soft Peach released for the holidays!  I ordered it, and I absolutely love it.  It is a fantastic every day blush color, but the color can also be built up in intensity.  The formula of this color is also just as good as the formula of the permanent colors.  I really hope that 10-Soft Peach is added as a permanent color - I really feel that it fills a gap in the current lineup of colors for this blush, and I want to be able to repurchase it when I run out!"

I wouldn’t necessarily call this “plum”. So people with darker skin tones should be mindful of the color palette when selecting.

I remember reading something Diana Vreeland wrote a long time ago...if you want to feel good about your face put on blush, if you want to feel good overall use a loely scent.I got the coral but it didn't suit me even though I'm pale olive, this pink just gives such a lift. I doo like to do a wash on my eyelids too. Very simple and healthy loking. I adore the packaging. I bought on the Klarna plan (it is pricy, ets' face it) but I love seeing it on my shelf, makes me feel like a glamourous socialite from the 60s. Nice mirror in the compact, too. It just perks me up and the colour lights up my face. It's been over a year and I've barely made a dint in it so I'd say it's pretty good value even though it's the most expensive blush I've ever owned. Totally worth it."

			"review_text": "For reference, I have combination skin: oily and eczema prone. The pictures included have zero filters or alterations.  This is a soft, blendable blush with a sheen of luminosity. Shade 4 leans more orange than coral-pink on my medium olive skin. Shade 4 would flatter anyone with an olive, neutral, and/or warm undertone with a fair to medium skin tone.  PROS: -The pearl finish leaves a fresh gleam without any chunks of glitter or obvious sparkle. -I swatched this around dry patches/textured areas of my face. The shimmer didn't emphasize the texture and it didn't catch onto any patches. -The packaging is sturdy with a secure clasp. I'm able to pop the latch open without issues from my long nails. It feels like it would last a couple of drops. -The blush is buildable so you can control the intensity of color. It makes it great for a beginner and those who prefer a soft finish.  MINUS 1 STAR: -The price. You'd have to be a fan of luxury to justify paying $49 for a blush. Full disclosure, I received this for free as a training product. I personally would wait for a sale to splurge on buying 1 shade.  NITPICKS: -The blush is buildable, BUT it took a bit for it to show up on me. The soft wash of color it gives and the fact that most of the shades have a white pigment base means that the blushes cater to lighter skin tones. Shades 6, 8 and 9 have richer pigments for those with more melanin rich skin than me. Anyone can wear any shade, but I don't personally reach for blushes that I have to build up a ton. -It blends better over a powdered face. I sometimes apply powder blush before I set my face for a dewy finish style of makeup, but this didn't work with that technique. Versatility is more of a personal preference for me, so this might not apply to everyone's style."

Once you take the blush out of the box, it will reveal a gorgeous little compact! Yes, it’s actually a little compact, it has a mirror. That was a fun surprise! The color is so pretty and the texture is smooth. There is a bit of a scent that I would say is some type of floral. I don’t tend to love floral scents but I was fine with this one. I took one star off because as beautiful and feminine as the color is, it will easily wipe right off the skin with a tissue. So to wear this blush successfully, I’d recommend a good setting spray and perhaps keep the compact on hand for any possible touch ups-maybe that’s why it’s a blush with a built in mirror! Considering the price point, I would have liked it to be more long lasting but it’s overall a very nice makeup product and if you are okay with possibly reapplying throughout the day, then this just might be a good fit for you!"

It worked on top of bare skin as well (good for me since I don’t wear foundation on the regular). It comes in a small compact with a mirror so you can easily keep it as a travel touch up item. Personally I liked the formula since it was pigmented but also blendable. However the color (true pink) was really not for me. I have light medium skin with warm undertones and this pink color just did not look great. It doesn’t look terrible and I can still make it work with a light application and by adding other blushes, but I would definitely consider getting this in another shade for blush. As eyeshadow it works well, but wouldn’t be my first option. I still have other blushes that I would prefer over this one, but it makes for a good gift. Overall I think this is a good product (with a hefty price tag) as long as you find a shade that works for you."

The color pay off I found to be wonderful. 1-2 swipes and I got my desired pigment. The formula wasn’t chalky at all. Which with a matte formula , I somewhat expected it to be a little more chalky, but it wasn’t. I actually found the formula to be quite silky. Didn’t apply patchy either and was fairly long lasting (when set). Blended out pretty effortlessly too. The color silky rose was a pretty spring time pink for my complexion.  My only negative is that I wanted to be  “in love” with the packaging but just wasn’t. The packaging looked a bit more juvenile than luxury and felt plastic/cheap. The mechanism to open the blush also isn’t the most accessible for those may have a disability or trouble with dexterity/ fine motor/joint issues."

This blush is so gentle to apply and although it has very nice pigment, layer by layer I decide the intensity of the color unlike others. 3. This contains Hyaluronic Acid that helps hydrate the skin and also has a floral aroma that I am in love with.   And honestly the list can go on because I'm with it, this one has a very functional mirror, the size is perfect to carry everywhere, there is no loose powder after each application even when I applied it with a brush. Also, when I use it as an eyeshadow, I have used my fingers to blend it and again I can say that it is a very functional product and highly recommended.

It also has a hydrating formula with ultra-thin powders that is suitable for all skin types, which is great for me since I have sensitive skin! It has been infused with Shea Butter, Hyaluronic Acid and Black Rose Gold to create a second-skin feel once applied. This is a scented product and I do like the scent, it isn't overpowering and once applied you can't smell it but if you have skin that doesn't love scented makeup products this is something to keep in mind. I love that I can use it both on the eyes and cheeks and for a product that is on the expensive side I love that you can get a couple of different uses out of it. The powder itself has a luminous matte finish and it applies so smoothly and blends with ease. It's long wearing and holds up for the day without the need to reapply. It adds a healthy look to the cheeks that I can't get enough of. Great product!!"

The blush glides onto the skin effortlessly, delivering a smooth and velvety finish.

With just a light swipe of the product, you can achieve a subtle flush of color that can easily be built up for a more intense look. The shade range is also impressive, offering options to suit a variety of skin tones.One of the things I appreciate most about this blush is its longevity. Once applied, it stays put throughout the day without fading or becoming patchy. This is particularly important for those with oily or combination skin, as it means you won't have to worry about constant touch-ups.If you're in the market for a high-end blush that will elevate your makeup routine, look no further than this beauty from Gucci."

In past experiences - I found that you might be paying for the luxury brand name rather than the actual quality of the product. This blush actually exceeded my expectations! I love a buildable powder blush that I can add on top of my liquid blush or just on its own on a bare face for a little pinch of color. This one does great on both occasions! It is pigmented just enough, and is the only blush in my collection that I have seen last on my skin all day. I was shocked. I've been obsessed with the super girly pink color lately and now this has legitimately been the only blush I have been using since I got it. I did receive it for free in exchange for my honest review. I genuinely recommend it! And I genuinely use it every day (as you may be able to tell in the photos!). A little added bonus is that the packaging feels so luxe 😍"

You see, dear reader, this blush has become an integral part of my daily beauty ritual—a secret weapon that adds a touch of sophistication and allure to my complexion. Let’s dive into the details, shall we? The Packaging: A Luxurious Prelude From the moment I unboxed this gem, I was captivated. The sleek, golden compact exudes opulence, and the embossed Gucci logo feels like a whispered promise of elegance. It’s the kind of packaging that makes you pause, take a breath, and appreciate the little luxuries in life. The Shade: Warm Berry, Like a Sunset Embrace Now, let’s talk about the star of the show—the shade itself. Warm Berry (06) is a harmonious blend of plummy-red richness with a satin finish. It’s as if the blush captured the essence of a sun-kissed berry at twilight. When I sweep it across my cheeks, I feel like I’m embracing the warmth of a cozy fireplace on a chilly evening. Texture and Application: Silky Smooth and Effortless The texture? Oh, it’s divine. Silky-smooth, finely-milled particles that glide onto my skin like a gentle caress. The pigmentation is semi-opaque but buildable—perfect for those days when I want a subtle flush or when I’m channeling my inner vixen. And blending? Child’s play. It melds seamlessly, leaving no harsh lines behind. Longevity: A Blush That Stands the Test of Time I’ve put this blush through its paces—from morning meetings to late-night soirées—and it never disappoints. It clings to my cheeks like a devoted companion, refusing to fade or lose its luminosity. Eight hours? Pfft. It laughs in the face of time. Final Verdict: A Love Affair in a Compact In summary, the Gucci Beauty Warm Berry (06) Luminous Matte Blush is more than makeup; it’s an affair—an intimate connection between me and my reflection. It whispers sophistication, romance, and a touch of mystery. So, my f"

I love more of a luminous blush more than matte because my skin is normal to dry."

The color is a light, peachy pink that is the stuff of dreams for a super fair skinned girl like me. Its color is reminiscent of nars famous shade, the staying power on Gucci’s is much better in comparison. I still have the rosy, lit from within glow at night that I buffed on to the apples of my cheeks at the beginning of the day, which is some seriously impressive staying power for a powdered blush. For clarity, the formula does have a bit of shimmer, which adds to the overall luminescence the blush gives you. It is so incredibly pretty on different skin tones, adding just the right amount of warmth without being too much. Finally, even its packaging is a work of art. It’s luxe and gorgeous while still being very well made, this will hold up well in your makeup bag/purse and on the go which is an important factor for many. Highly recommend!"

Blush de Beauty is buildable, and you might need to add a few layers, especially if you are used to using a highly pigmented liquid blush. I’m obsessed with the very subtle scent, which can only be smelled up close.

It also lasts me all day, so I don't need to reapply which is another great thing. This blush is actually my color, & it was quite pigmented. The color I chose was intense plum, & let me tell you I was not disappointed. I literally took my brush & dipped it  in the blush every so slightly before applying it to my face, & the color was  really pigmented when i applied it which is amazing. I was seeking for a blush that leans more towards a heavier rosy pink & red tone, & this delivered. I generally apply blush to my cheeks and nose, so I hope the photographs show how cute this blush is. I definitely recommend you this blush even if it is a bit on the pricier side because a little bit of product goes a long way.  The color is stunning & it’s long lasting what can get better than that?"

A touch on the eyelids that matches the cheeks makes a very soft and sweet look.  The real difference is the addition of hyaluronic acid and shea butter that prevents the skin from drying out.  It is lightly scented, which I like, but some might prefer unscented make up."

I had all shades, the pinks, when lightly applied, are all pretty close, just subtle differences, so you can pick up any.

It’s very highly pigmented so a little powder goes a long way, and the product should last a long time. I put a little on my fingers and blended it onto my cheeks and eyelids - it’s multi-use, you can use it as an eyeshadow too. It looks extra pretty having your eyeshadow match your blush and with the easily buildable coverage you could experiment with different looks like intense eyeshadow and subtle blush. You really can achieve both subtle and dramatic looks with this blush and everything in between. You could wear it every day and for special occasions alike. It’s a really good quality product with an excellent satiny smooth powder texture that is easy to use to create whatever lovely look you’re going through.

			"review_text": "When I think high end, Gucci is a brand that instantly comes to mind! I expected great things from this blush, from name alone. Let me start by saying I’m not a blush person. Maybe it’s that my skin already gives off a pink glimmer or that I am just scared of not using it properly(I was a kid in the 80’s so I have good reason to believe this, if you remember blush from the 80’s) I was a bridesmaid in a wedding and the MUA applied blush. I didn’t hate it but I also never really invested time into learning how to apply it so I didn’t look like a circus clown. I chose this peach shade, hoping that it wouldn’t expose more of the redness in my skin. At first, it looked like I applied it too heavily and was about to have orange stained tears rolling down my cheeks. I blended it out into a soft peach color and actually liked the results. Maybe I will start to ease up my hesitation on blush now. Other stand out features to this product is the packaging! This is exactly what I would expect from Gucci. Beautiful gold features with little gold stars. The Gucci name imprinted into the blush and the prominent logo on top of the compact. It looks quite stunning amongst my makeup collection.  *I received this complimentary of Influenster to try out and give my honest opinion about*"

The packaging of this is absolutely gorgeous - a rose gold and pink compact with a mirror inside. However it’s a little hard to get open and I was afraid I was going to nick the inside with my finger nail trying to get it open. When applying to cheeks it goes on like butter, so silky and smooth! I’m not sure why it’s called luminous matte, I would describe this as just plain old matte. There is no glitter/sparkle or anything like that that would make this appear anything other than matte. It blends so nicely with buildable coverage if you want a more pigmented look. Usually powder blush doesn’t last that long on my skin without applying over top of cream blush but this lasted for almost 4 hours on its own before starting to fade!"

The formula of this blush is beyond stellar. It’s silky smooth and adheres to your skin so naturally. Another major perk is that it looks just as fresh and vibrant at the end of the day as it does when you first apply it — which is a hard thing to find in most blushes. I also love that this blush has a slight sheen to it but isn’t sparkly. This makes it the perfect choice for everyday wear. It’s also very blendable and lasts a long time since a little bit goes a long way. In my opinion, this Gucci Blush is fully worth the hype. It does have a slightly higher price point than most blush options on the market, but because it lasts so long and holds up so well throughout the day, I think it’s worth the splurge. Also, it comes in so many color options so there’s a good match for just about everyone. Please note that it is fragranced, for those who are sensitive."

Intense Plum is a midtoned berry shade with a neutral undertone and satin finish that gives a healthy glow to the skin without any glitter, shimmer or sparkle. The pigmentation is buildable but even with a heavy hand, doesn't look cakey or powdery. It gives a natural just in from the cold flush to my vampire pale skintone but will also work across a variety of others.  I also own True Pink, Rosy Beige and Silky Rose (purchased all 4 myself) and can't recommend the line enough; you won't be disappointed, whichever shade you choose!"

True Pink is a classic bubblegum shade with a strong cool undertone, buildable pigmentation and a satin finish without any glitter, shimmer or sparkle. I love that it gives a natural flush and healthy glow to my vampire pale skintone but this shade will suit others as well.  **True Pink is a color dupe for Dior's Rosy Glow blush in Pink but the recent reformulation is terrible so I would definitely recommend buying this instead."

I did find that the blush lasted longer on the cheeks with the use of face primer and setting spray. It wore well after 6 hours with a little fading and I already have received compliments while wearing it.

The only con I can think of really is how small the product is by volume compared to the price (it's around the size of a mini blush) but that tends to be the case with luxury brands so not a surprise. it is also scented which i know isn't preferred for some - I'm usually not a fan of fragrance in makeup myself, but the gucci scent is heavenly imo so I don't mind it at all, but something to note if you're sensitive to scented makeup."

I got it because I was on the hunt for a replacement for my favorite blush that was discontinued. The formula is very nice, and it diffuses easily. The color is a nice warm medium pink that works for my medium olive skin tone, but I'm not sure it would work for anyone darker than that because as I apply more layers, it develops a pearly finish that can start to look chalky. My other major gripe is that the packaging doesn't feel luxe at all, and at this price point, that's unacceptable. It's mostly plastic and quite bulky, and the clasp doesn't actually close properly so it's only a matter of time before it breaks. Blush is my favorite makeup item so I've tried a lot of them and I'm not afraid to spend on a good product, so trust me when I say that once you cut past all the hype, this product is just okay and you can definitely find cheaper and better. I wouldn't repurchase or recommend."

I was so excited to try this blush but I've found it incredibly difficult to work with. 05 Rosy Beige is pretty sheer, which is fine, but when I build up the blush, I find that it doesn't build up evenly, and I get uneven application. I've tried tons of brushes and keep getting the same result. IMO, if you're looking for a product similar but easier to work with, pick up Pat McGrath Fleurtatious. In the attached photos, nearest my wrist is PM Fleurtatious, nearest my elbow is Gucci 05 Rosy Beige"

Love to see Gucci and Sephora embracing makeup as something not just for femme-presenting folks) and this is the first and only blush I will ever wear on my eyes because it doesn’t make me just look super stoned and red eyed for once.

Not only does this warm berry color look wonderful on a lot of different skin tones, it glides on smoothly, blends out easily, and lasts quite a while.

I love that this compact is so cute, small, and simple, making it easy to use, and carry around in your purse. This formula is also true to color, and is very light as well. A little goes a long way, so it’s definitely buildable. Another thing I love about this blush is how easy it goes on the skin, I have not only used it as blush, but also as an eyeshadow. And wow the amount of questions and compliments this little blush as gotten me. Let me also mention that this blush is lightly scented, it has a nice clean floral smell that does wear off after a while. So no lingering scent. But it does smell amazing, not like those other blushes that smell the chemicals.  I am completely obsessed with it!!! It’s a must have in your makeup bag!   (This blush was sent to me by gucci)"

			"review_text": "The first thing that caught my eye about these blushes was the packaging - the compact is beautiful, which is not surprising as Gucci Beauty has done an exceptional job with the presentation of its beauty products. But, what about the actual quality and performance of the blush? Here's my honest and authentic opinion as a Sephora Beauty Insider Community Ambassador after having it be my go-to blush for the past 5 days.   WHAT I LIKE:  * Soft, silky texture* Buttery smooth application  * Blends easily  * Buildable coverage  * Beautiful packaging  * Good lasting power - the color stayed on my face, with minimal fading or transfer, for about 7, sometimes 8, hours on most days.   AREA(S) FOR IMPROVEMENT:  * The shades in this initial release offered a nice variety for my fair-to-light complexion, but it would be great to see the shade range expand to include colors deeper than 06 Warm Berry (which, by the way, is gorgeous!). * I had some difficulty opening the compact and was afraid I'd dig my fingernail into the product when I did. It'll take some getting used to, for me, at least.  FYI / ADDITIONAL THOUGHTS: * 05 Rosy Beige (sometimes called Rosy Tan) is a neutral-to-neutral-warm dusty-rose/mauve brown shade.  * I found the finish of this blush to be more on the satin side - it's not matte nor luminous, despite its name. Looks natural on my skin; no shimmer or glitter particles. * Has a noticeable floral scent; I don't mind it and it does fade away, but those sensitive to fragrance, and especially to floral scents, might want to pass on these blushes.  BUY, BUY, BUY or BYE-BYE?  * I'm happy I picked up this blush and there are a couple of other shades that have caught my eye. That said, this isn't a must have but a nice-to-have item, especially if you like Gucci Beauty or luxury beauty products."

The formula melts into the skin and gives you a subtle natural luminosity. This is a gorgeous blush. The packaging is very nice as well. Although not a deal breaker for me, it unfortunately has a fragrance which I don't particularly care for that fortunately seems to dissipate after a while."

I not only used this on my cheeks to bring some natural glow to my face, but also applied this blush on my eyes. I love how versatile this product can be used and that it has a luminous matte finish. There were no issues with this blush breaking apart or any fall out product left behind. This blush is so lightweight feeling. The packaging is absolutely top end gorgeous. You can tell right away when opening the box that this blush is no joke. I looked up the price of this blush and I would most definitely purchase this in the future, now that I've had the opportunity to try it. The locking mechanism works great and does not open up while it is in my cosmetic bag. My skin type is a combination of dry and oily. I also like how they incorporated three amazing ingredients. Hyaluronic acid, shea butter and black rose oil. All three ingredients give the benefits that my skin needs when using this blush. I would highly recommend buying Gucci blush."

It didn’t look cakey, it was smooth and blendable, and a perfect color for fall! I worked a full shift at work and have worn it for over 12 hours and it is still as vibrant as when I first applied it! My only complaint is that it does seem a little tricky to open, but it could be user error..the product is also scented so if you are sensitive to fragrance you might now like this product. I personally really like the scent, it smells like a fruity floral perfume. Overall it is  a wonderful blush and I’m happy to have it in my collection."

I is a luminous matte which is also blurring on the skin but with a more natural finish. I cannot put them down. I put on bate skin to try the color and I'd wear these without a foundations for sure.  the fact that they look gorgeous on the eyes for a monochromatic look, chefs kiss*.

Packaging is glam, sturdy and perfect size to carry in my purse. The shade I got is Rose tan  and I couldn’t pick a better color myself. It’s so natural yet brings my face and make up alive. For me blush is a must! Even on my most basic makeup days I have to have blush, otherwise I look plain and death lol (I blame it on my beige undertone skin color) This rose beige tone is perfect for light medium skin tones. Tbh, at first the color looked a little to deep for me, but it’s not! once applied it melts into your skin so beautiful and effortless that looks like your natural color peeking through. Plus, this is labeled as a cheeks and EYES product, so I gave it a test and -even though I have super oily eyelids- it looks so beautiful and it holds in place all day long. This is a winner for oily skins. Given the price, I think it’s perfect you can use it for more than just blush and it comes handy when you’re on the go or want to create a monochromatic look. Perfect to carry it with you everyday everywhere.  Thanks Influenster and Sephora for such a wonderful treat."

It was so hard to narrow down the colors I wanted because even though my Sephora had them they were not out on the gondola yet. I decided between warm berry and sweet peach and did a buy online pick up in store. Warm berry is the perfect shade for a Fall or Winter look. It applies a lot lighter than what you see in the pan but still has a gorgeous rich berry tone to it.  The packaging to open the blush can be tricky. Sometimes I found it easier to open then other times. It is pricey for the amount you get but if you can get it during a sale I would pick it up right away."

Lets hope this time all goes well that way I don't have to try to remember every exact word I wrote for a third time around! Lol I want to say first off this is one of the first times I've used a blush on my lids and didn't feel like the chalky powder formula of it completely stripped them of all their moisture. That inturn created God awful creasing, which this didn't at all. This silky, smooth formula smoothed across my lids seamlessly, and this color I received is great for the upcoming season of fall. Like clothes this time of year, you can layer this up, and down as well depending on your complexion, and ability to coordinate. I also had worn this on the apples of my cheeks and used a fluffy brush and blended it out towards my temples, and when I tell you don't knock it till you try it, I'm serious because at first glance after I had put a light sweep onto my apples I thought to myself oh man, what the heck am I gonna be able to do with this stuff her e? This is not a good color for me at all. I didn't want to except that I had to really get on my favorite sites and write bad reviews on a good product due to a color mishaps, so I decided to just go ahead and get out my brushes and go to work softening it out, and once I did I tell you I am so glad that I didn't just leave it at that and be done cause if I would've, I would've missed out on a really great product that's multipurpose, and great feelin on my skin. Thank you so much for reading my review and I hope that this helps someone who's just not too sure to close their eyes and just make the leap. Trust me, you'll not regret it. Looking forward for more products to review so look for reviews as I get some more products coming in. Xoxos"

The shade “warm berry” is a lovely deep shade with a hint of brick that will be perfect for fall. I was really impressed with the finish - it’s called “luminous matte” and I loved how natural it looked. I’m loving the monochromatic look lately, so I also used this blush to add a wash of color to my eyes. I’ll definitely be checking out the other shades!"

It’s important to bring up that all shades can be used for a rush of color on cheeks and eyes. I apply this blush every day for any occasion, parties, work and so on. Amazing product!"

			"review_text": "I received this product free from Influenster and Gucci for my honest review. And the truth is that Gucci gave us a blush in a covetable compact that’s so pretty it’ll make you want to take it everywhere with you. And that’s the idea. The compact itself has a good weight to it and does not look or feel cheap. Gucci did it right with the materials they chose for the product.   I got to try out Tender Apricot 02 which is such a beautiful peachy color. The coverage is light but buildable; both translucent and pigmented. On the days you might want just a flush of color, it’s not a blush you’ll have to heavily blot after to get some of that pigment off. It has a beautiful velvety, smooth texture. It’s great for creating a number of different looks and they encourage you to use elsewhere on your face. The peachy color did wonders on my eyes when I used it. Just a little bit on my lids and it brightened up my eyes.  It’s definitely a versatile compact that’s perfect for stashing in your bag (day/night) for little touch ups. The small size makes it perfect for evening bags.   Final verdict: this is the compact I’ll be bringing with me for my long summer nights out in Greece. Not only is she pretty and worthy of my Euro travels, but she works well, too. Win, win!"

It's a sweet pink shade called radiant pink. At first I thought it would be too light for my skin but it's the perfect shade for daytime with one quick brush or fun Barbie pink for evening with a couple brushes.  I put a little on my lids and cheeks after a base of tinted sunscreen and headed out to do my errands. It feel light and adds the ideal amount of shading for a casual daytime look."
