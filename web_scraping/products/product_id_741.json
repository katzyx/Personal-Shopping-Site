When I bought this I used it once a week and it made my skin look refreshed and glowy. But when I realized this was taming my acne I started using it daily as a spot treatment on my problem patch. After months of this area getting worse and spreading further, I finally have ZERO breakouts after only 1-2 weeks of daily use !!!! I’m not sure if this is recommended for daily use but I don’t see any irritation or redness, so I will be continuing as the results are unbelievable! I’m so thrilled with this product I will definitely be exploring the rest of their line.   The price point is so reasonable and a little product goes a long way!"

			"review_text": "Acne prone, combo ( drier in winter, oily in the summer)  I used this mask for about 3 months (may-july): At first, I noticed a slight difference the following 1-3 days after using the mask on my nose and T-zone area. It felt smoother and I thought that this mask was working and helping reduce my whiteheads and work on my blackheads. To be honest, I never really saw a change in my blackheads, but my nose did feel a lot smoother to the touch in the days following the mask treatment. I noticed my forehead (T-zone) area start to get a little bumpy but I thought it was natural purging. During this time, I would do the mask about once a week on my t-zone and the rest of my week consisted of a hydrating barrier restoring routine.   Then, I decided to use this mask on my entire face, stupidly thinking that the reduction in nose texture meant that it would help my entire face. I started breaking out pretty badly, but I thought it was again just my skin reacting to the mask. Again, I was only using this mask once a week with no other actives. The rest of my week still consisted of a hydrating barrier restoring routine. Then my skin started breaking out so badly, I have never had such a bad breakout in my life. I always considered my acne to be decently present with one or two pimples on my face (either healing or new ones) at all times with residual acne scars; in addition, I always broke out way more on my left side compared to my right side.   This breakout was so bad; it spanned both my cheeks with about 20 new cystic acne and pimple spots on each side and also my forehead. It felt like FIRE, it was so itchy, I wanted to scratch my face off, but my skin was literally hot to the touch and painful. I had three new pustules on each side almost every day, and the cystic acne was raging. From August to current day (December), I have finally healed most of the breakout and I have been left with so much scarring. This mask may work for some people, but please use with caution."

			"review_text": "I was urged to try this during one of the in-store events that featured this brand. I am completely new to this line, and at this price I figured it wouldn't hurt to try. I have combination, aging skin, and I usually use a detox mask about once every week or two to deal with the oily portions on my face. I have a high-end brand ($$$ in price) I like to use, but honestly it's not very practical for weekly use. I tried this when I felt I needed a mid-week pick-me-up on my nose and my first impression was that I could tell it worked, but I didn't really feel blown over. I tried it another time when I needed a full-face application and that's when I realized the efficacy of this. For this price range, this is a solid workhorse to have in your skincare cabinet. A little goes a long way, too. It definitely held me over until I went in for a deeper treatment with my favorite luxe product. This is a reliable back-up to have on hand and I'm glad I gave it a try!"

As a WOC from the Caribbean, hydration, radiance, and maintaining that “island glow” is a non-noticeable for me, period!  I have been consistently using Korean skin care for over 4 years, with Innisfree being one of my more recent addition which I having been consistently using for almost 1 year.  I have sensitive skin and avoid heavy oil based products.  After numerous trial and error, I decided to try Innisfree’s Green Tea line which is more on the water based side.  I am soooo happy I took the chance because my skin love and soak these products up, leaving beautiful radiant/glowing skin.  My skin be skin-in’ hunty! I recommend all the products in this line if you are like me with sensitive skin and appreciate clean, hydrating yet moisturizing products.  CON: The only product I didn’t care to repurchase (and I have gone through 2 bottles) is the Vitamin C.  I personally did not see a difference after using for 2 months consistently AM and PM.  Hence the 4/5 star review.  If they improve their Vitamin C potency, definitely a 5/5 line for me.  I hope this review was helpful🤎"

There are a lot of people complaining if you look for it, even people who don't have sensitive skin like me.This made my skin red, puffy, and irritated- it was enough for me to stop using the mask after two tries. Worst part is I don't even have terribly sensitive skin and even if you don't take that into account people without sensitive skin were reacting. Since I don't wanna leave you folks stranded for those of you looking for a good recommendation I recommend supermud from glam glow that was a really awesome product they used to have. Do not buy this subpar product folks, I am sooooo glad I didn't do this right before the semester happened because my face is so unbelievably red and I'm gonna need time to fix this."

It didn’t feel like it was burning and I don’t really have sensitive skin so I’m not sure why it left my face so red but it was worrisome. The redness ended up going away after an hour or so. I can’t speak on how well it actually works since I’ve only used it once and that was 8 hours ago but right away, my skin was softer (I struggle with textured skin) and my pores look less clogged which is greats bc that’s why I bought this mask!

I’ve gotten so many samples where I can’t really get an idea of the product bc they’re so small. Recently had a big breakout (mix of starting my period and had a weekend full of drinking and fried food!) so I decided to give it a try. Blew my mind. I have really large pores on my nose that almost look like really light freckles when you get close. I use a lot of expensive products to clean & maintain my skin. This product helped with my breakout (which I expected) but also drastically minimized the color and size of my pores (not expected). Used the mask again a couple days later and pores/breakout got even better!  I’ve thrown a lot of nice stuff on my face over the years trying to hack away at the pores but this mask did it in two goes - definitely buying a regular sized product and including it in my routine"

Overall my skin has never been better, it's completely blemish-free (I struggled for a long time) and I am happy to find a very pleasant and basic face mask to add into my weekly face routine."

I’m big on texture, so the creaminess of this mask was ideal. It minimized the look of my pores, too—so it provided a great pre-makeup base. The innovative use of volcanic clusters was also a great touch for me as a dermatology/skincare aficionado. I would absolutely recommend using this face mask!"

Felt lovely on the skin until... I started feeling what others describe in their reviews as the cooling sensation. I jumped right on to Sephora to figure out what else is in this clay mask. And there it was, the AHA. The AHA property is not marked on the bottle nor on the box it came in. I then proceeded to get this off my face immediately, not because it is bad but because I used an exfoliator the night before. As some other reviewers said this made them break out and it's because if too many frequently used products have AHA or BHA in them that will make skin upset and cause breakouts. I am surely willing to use again but next time do so fully informed. All that being said after the apx 5 mins I had it on, my face feels nice and my pores look a little smaller."

The Innisfree Super Volcanic AHA Pore Clearing Clay Mask is a game-changer for anyone seeking a deep cleanse and refined pores. Its volcanic clusters and AHA formula work wonders in absorbing excess sebum, exfoliating the skin, and reducing blackheads and whiteheads. The mask's smooth texture makes it easy to apply, and it dries quickly without causing discomfort. After use, my skin felt noticeably cleaner, smoother, and more refreshed. Innisfree has truly delivered an exceptional product that lives up to its promises, making it a must-have in any skincare routine. Its smell is almost non-existent and it does work as promised. Would definitely recommend to family, friends and anyone seeking clean (and clear) skin!"

My skin is so much smoother than it was before I started using it. and it lasts forever, I still have 1/3 of the jar left and another jar in stock because I know I'll continue to use it for the forseeable future. It's inexpensive and I would recommend this product to anyone"

It dries down nicely - it doesn’t really get that “tight” feeling, but you can feel the acids tingling a bit - or at least I can; I have somewhat sensitive skin lately. Which brings me to my next point: this really exists in the sweet spot for me — it’s exfoliating and pore clearing, but also hydrating and doesn’t irritate my skin at all. I’m very impressed."

If you want better result then you might want to try Fenti cookies n clean. I use both of those products depending on how much my face requires that week. If I feel good then I use this one, if I need more I use Fenty.  Fenty of course is a higher price point so I like to have this to supplement that cost. This mask should be good for all skin types as It just pulls out the crap in your face to make you feel more clean and pure than a cleanser really does."

The mask is cooling and refreshing and leaves your face visibly smoother and pores are visibly smaller - however, it does not leave you feeling you dry or tight which I appreciated. I have oily skin and have breakouts from time-to-time (mostly cystic and around my period) but this has kept my skin in check and is a nice treat after a long day. I absolutely recommend you try this, especially for its price point."

This is my honest and authentic opinion, as a Sephora Beauty Insider Community Ambassador.   This is a no muss, no fuss, get it done creamy, light charcoal grey hued, kaolin clay based mask that when used once or twice per week on the oiliest parts of my combination skin (nose, chin and jawline) gently but effectively exfoliates, clarifies, deep cleans, softens and smooths skin in under 20 minutes, without leaving it overly dry or tight. All for under $20 ($15 + tax). A little goes a long way so you get a lot of bang for your buck with this beauty.   Consistent use over time, whether as a spot treatment or applied over a larger part of my face, has helped with maskne as well as periodic breakouts. It’s been an amazing ally in the fight against blackheads and breakouts. As far as clay masks go, this is in my top 3! 🏆   Simple and simply effective. A must have for me. Highly recommend.👍🏼"

I feel after more uses I'll be able to see more of a difference in my skin but I was reading this like article like reviewing some products and in the article it said I could use this as a spot treatment and I have had these stubborn little bumps on my chin and I wasn't expecting it to get rid of them because they have been there for so so long but the next day OMG THEY WERE literally  GONE like there is still 1 or 2 bumps but this stuff is amazing as a spot treatment and as a mask."

It certainly helps to control oil, but isn't overly drying. There actually aren't that many volcanic clusters, but the ones that are there provide a bit of physical exfoliation, too.

I typically don’t use clay masks because I have quite an extensive skincare regimen and regularly use other exfoliants (AHAs and BHAs), Retin A, and the occasional nose strip to clear out any pesky leftover blackheads.  So I used this recently (accidentally kept it on much much longer than directed but no big deal, I often intentionally do that anyway), removed it, and was left with THE cleanest skin I’ve seen in a long time!  My pores were literally non existent.  They were just gone.  I proceeded with my serums, etc and my skin was glowing like the stars.  It was a beautiful sight lol.  So I just ordered the full size jar.  I do realize the effects won’t last forever but hopefully they’re cumulative over time, just like the effects of other skincare products used regularly and religiously.  I’ll be adding this to my skincare regimen and will use a couple times each week.  I had no issues with dryness after using this, and I’m 60, but I also use several serums twice a day, including hyaluronic acid, and just a small amount of La Mer moisturizer, so I keep my skin in pretty good shape and noticed no excessive dryness from using this product ….just really tight pores:).  I’d definitely recommend trying, especially at such a reasonable price point and with Sephora’s generous return policy if it doesn’t work as well for you .."

I use it before showering (much easier to rinse off), then cleanse with the indie lee Brightening cleanser (also my holy grail) and my Foreo.

I don’t know what it is but i loved the texture of the mask, it was so thick and smooth snd it spread so easily , great for taking those face mask aesthetic pictures! There was no overpowering smell like most face masks which i loved- great for my sensitive skin. Taking it off is just like a regular clay mask- a pain lol. Honestly just after one use it made my skin feel so much smoother and brighter, especially those rough blackheads on my nose which i was surprised by! I honestly really loved it, will definitely be purchasing again✨"

I just need a simple pore cleaning mask so it fits the bill nicely for that need. I don't know that it would help with acne or other issues, but I don't think it's advertised to do so...

The texture is thick, and a little on the dry side.  However, it spreads well.  I apply this only where I need it, which is basically my T zone.  I apply it so that it is opaque.  It dries in about 10-15 minutes.  (It isn't one of those clay masks that dries down so much that is is uncomfortable.)  It rinses off really easily.  The best part is that really reduces blackheads.  I've found that the ones on my nose have significantly decreased in size.  Plus, this is helping reduce a stubborn one I have on my forehead.  And of course the price is excellent.

I have been using it for about three weeks twice a week now, and I can definitely say it has minimized the appearance of pore size and reduced the incidence of blemishes. My skin feels very nice and smooth once I wash this mask off. I really enjoy that, unlike many other clay masks, it doesn't get uncomfortably tight and dries out your skin. This mask also has a cooling effect, which I found very soothing!  If you are looking for a weekly/twice a week treatment that feels good, serves an exfoliating purpose, and helps reduce the appearance of pores, this is definitely for you!  Some things to keep in mind, if you're interested in this mask: - Pores can't be physically shrunk nor do they just open and close at will. Masks like this just temporarily reduce the appearance by exfoliating pores. If you have more visible pores, they will not magically disappear, but this mask will significantly help shrink their appearance. Like with any mask, that effect is temporary and most visible in the few hours/day after using the mask; however, I found the effect on pore size to be longer-lasting with this mask than with other clay masks. - This mask is both a chemical and physical exfoliator, so while it does not tighten as much as other masks, it is super important to get some moisturizing ingredients on your face asap!"

After a few uses I couldn’t be happier or more impressed with this mask. I was monitoring the Sephora site for months waiting to buy this full sized. I even debated buying directly from innisfree because this is just such a fantastic product. Finally I got my hands on a full size and I couldn’t be happier about it. This mask will have you hooked after first use! I’ve been using this for about 3/4 months now and it will be a permanent part of my skin care routine.  This mask glides on with ease. It’s not too thick that it’s difficult to spread or anything like that. It’s smooth and soft on application. It spreads so nice and even that it feels luxurious. It also dries very quickly which I really appreciate it. After rinsing my skin feels so soft and smooth it feels irresistible!! I didn’t experience any crazy purging or break outs after using. I just love what this mask does for my skin. I have noticed that since I started using this mask about once a week the break out I do get a less frequent and I experience little to no white heads. I couldn’t be happier with this mask and I absolutely highly recommend. You can’t beat the price and what it does to make my skin super soft supple clean and clear! Don’t hesitate to buy this before it sells back out!"

Probable culprit :mask uses vegetable oil, so that would likely explain my own breakouts in any event lol every cheap drugstore/Sally brand I've used has worked way way better than this. Don't like to waste though so will use up as a detox foot mask once a week or so come summer. Please guys, minimize waste wherever you can. If you find a clay mask too drying etc for your sensitive skin, you can use it as foot detox, armpit detox, and even for your scalp to suck up greasy oil once a week!

I wasn’t blown away but I think it’s a really good clay mask to help clear skin and excess oils from your pores. Takes awhile to get off but that’s like most clay masks anyways. If you’re looking for a nice mask that makes your skin feel clean and firm afterwards, but don’t want anything too strong or want to pay a lot, this is the mask for you! The size is also really good for the price!"

Because of my dryness, I only put it on areas like my nose and chin, where my pores were most problematic, but it didn't really do anything.  I did however try it on my boyfriend who does have oily skin and it seemed to work really well on him, especially his nose. Wow, when the mask dried (which it does so well, hard to describe but it's so smooth like second skin), his nose was covered in dark wet-like spots from his pores. Very oddly satisfying to see that. He enjoyed it. The only thing is its affects don't last long, so this is a mask you would have to keep using on a regular basis to enjoy its affects. That's just not for me.  By the way, it smells beautiful, but could really do without the walnut powder."

The volcanic clusters do not really add a lot of texture to the mask. It does not dry down, or leave my skin tight, even if I have left on for a little long. It is adequate at getting into pores and helping to clear them out. I have used once a week for the past 6 weeks, and haven't noticed any positive change to my skin versus any other product. My partner who has oily skin also used, and it was okay, but the lactic/glycolic acid was too much in addition to his face wash and moisturizer. Keep in mind that this product does contain these AHAs, so if you are sensitive or if you are using some already, you might have to alter your routine."

I leave the mask on for at least 15 minutes, until dry to the touch. After 5 minutes, my pores are very visible because the volcanic clusters are pulling the oil out of my skin! It’s very interesting to watch and the mask feels very rejuvenating and cooling. There is pretty much no smell at all which is also a plus! Obviously there is no magical mask that will eradicate all your acne and fine lines but for $15, this mask visibly shrinks my pores and leaves my skin glowing and bright.

Unlike the orchid cream and the green tea serum, the clay mask has no scent - it just smells like clay. Other clay masks I have used sometimes have clumps or pieces of material so it does not feel nice or makes it difficult to spread onto the skin. This mask has a very smooth consistency and it spread very nicely onto my face. It dries into a light grey colour and tightens like other clay masks. It washed off nicely without the need to scrape off pieces or heavy rubbing. I really enjoyed this mask and will continue using it. #trywithtopbox #freeproduct"

This clay mask however, is not nearly as drying. I only applied a super thin layer on my face with more focus on the poresnon my nose. It was easy to spread on your face without getting super thick or heavy. Washing this off was a relatively quick and painless process. I noticed my skin didn't feel dry or tight afterwards and my skin felt smooth. My pores also felt a little less clogged.  I think if you are looking for a clay mask that is on the gentler side and have sensitive or acne prone skin, this might be the mask for you! #freeproduct"

			"review_text": "I received a full-size version of this mask with innisfree's Volcanic Holiday Set. People had been raving to me about this product, so I was excited to see what the hype was about!  So now that I'm going to school again, I have to wear a mask all the time, which doesn't give me maskne, but it definitely isn't the best thing ever for my skin. Wearing a mask all the time definitely makes my pores a lot more noticeable, since there's more dirt and oil buildup, so I was intrigued to see a mask that supposedly clears pores.   Some people may not be impressed by the size of the container, but this is a VERY DENSE mask, and you really don't need a lot! At $15, this product is actually a VERY good price - most innisfree products are very affordable and a great value!  This mask was super easy to apply - it spreads really easily, and you don't need much to cover your face. Once it was on, I didn't feel any sort of burning sensation - in fact, the mask actually felt quite cooling and refreshing, which was an added bonus, since it isn't specifically a cooling mask. Another great thing about this mask is that you only need to leave it on for a relatively short period of time - 10 minutes - so it's great for people on the go!   After washing the mask off after it had been 10 minutes, I noticed that my pores looked significantly smaller and, as a result, my skin looked glowier! A lot of clay masks can be drying, but my skin actually felt hydrated after using this, which is amazing! I didn't notice any redness or bumps on my face, which I've experienced with other clay masks, especially the first time that I use them. This product is also fragrance-free which is really good for people with skin sensitive to fragrance.   In conclusion, I think that this mask is a great product for anyone and everyone - it clears pores and makes them look smaller without being overly drying, and makes your skin look really soft and smooth at a great value!"

I got a free sample of this and it’s sitting in my cart now as a full size. I feel like this produced near instant results and any remaining clogged pores were easily extracted (sorry derms!) afterwards. I’ve literally paid 2-3x as much for a less effective product. This one is amazing  Note: moisturise afterwards so that your skin doesn’t over compensate for the drying effect of the mask and recreate the problem it was meant to solve"

It works much, much better at getting the gunk out of the pores on my nose than clinique’s charcoal mask. And while I love The Ordinary’s salicylic acid mask, it’s pretty rough on my skin, and this is much more gentle. $15 is a steal! A little goes a long way."

			"review_text": "This product gives me mixed feelings. (got the trial size for free from a promotion) After consistent use for 3 weeks here are my thoughts:  PROS: -I love how it isn't stripping for a clay based mask. I was able to use this on my not-as-oily areas without any dryness.  -It also chemically exfoliates using glycolic and lactic acid, and it doesn't sting my skin.  -THE PRICE is unbeatable. $15 for such a large bottle, that probably will give you enough to last for 3-4 months if you use it 2-3 time a week.   CONS: - It contains WALNUT SHELL POWDER. This is the same kind of stuff in St. Ives scrubs... As long as you don't rub your skin when washing this off you should be fine, but it still is unsettling to know it exists in this product. -It has Fragrance. Most people tend to avoid fragrance since it can be irritating, but I personally don't mind it in a wash off product like a mask. This does have a hefty fragrance smell though...  Overall, not a horrible product. It personally did not give me much results besides making my face feel more clean and oil free without over stripping it. If you're looking for something just for fun and affordable, this is a pretty solid product."

I mainly didn't like the fact that it has some ingredients that are not clean to me, like PEG's, drying alcohol, walnut shell powder which can be abrasive, etc. At least there is no parabens or sulfates or other bad ingredients that I don't like. I just wish it was cleaner. It's a good price for what you get it's only $15 for 3.38 fluid ounces. If they worked on the ingredients which would also help with my somewhat sensitive skin, I would definitely give this a higher rating. I appreciate getting this gifted by Innisfree for my honest review."

Most pore cleaning clay masks make your skin feel super tight and dry both during the time you use it and after you take it off, but this one didn’t give me a tight feeling because it doesn’t dry down like other clay masks!! It still feels hydrating and comfortable when you wear it and my skin felt soft and clean afterwards!!! The clusters are soft and don’t feel irritating at all  Using this mask also makes it really easy to extract blackheads afterwards! Would definitely purchase this on my own and 100% recommend"

Normally I steer clear of clay masks because I have dry skin and they tend to pull oil out, which is the opposite of what I want in a skincare product. Not only does this product NOT do that, it's actually very hydrating. The application is SUPER SMOOTH for a clay mask, it glides on and the product stretches really well, a little but goes far. When it dries down it doesn't tighten up like most clays do, another great sign it isn't drying you out. After the time is up you just add a little water and massage it to get those little clusters to kind of exfoliate as well. Was easy to rinse and it left my face as smooth and ready for my night routine as good as some of my much more aggressive masks do. Innisfree is quickly becoming a favorite in my regimen. This product was gifted by innisfree to me for my HONEST review."

The mask left my skin feeling firm and clean, and also helped reduce the appearance of my nose pores, which are the most visible pores on my face. Also, my face produces quite a bit of oil/sebum around my nose and under-eye area, which the mask helped remove some of the excess gunk. The scent is quite mild, so I doubt it'll bother you.

It's a creamier, not so thick formula compared to other clay masks.  So it was easy to apply all over the face.  What's the time was up to remove,  I added a bit warm water to start and started massaging.  It does feel exfoliating.  I was surprised it didn't overly dry my skin out, but I still went in with a good moisturizer.  You could also use a good facial oil instead of a moisturizer to follow after the mask.  This innisfree pore clearing clay mask does have some good key ingredients, lactid acid and Jeju volcanic clusterss.  If you have dry skin like I do, then I recommend only using this no more than two times a week.  Maybe even once a week just depending on how your skin feels after.  Also don't forget to moisturize after.  I've already recommended this innisfree clearing clay mask to a family member who is having a big pore breakout.  As far as how it felt on my skin, it didn't make me itchy, irritate my skin, or any tingling."

I used a spatula to apply evenly and you can only wear twice a week. You let it sit on your skin for 10 minutes. You can see small pieces of volcanic clusters in the formula. Never tried a clay mask and i do see a difference in my pores it did reduce them, doesn't make them go away."

The product goes on really smoothly, and I only need a little bit to fully cover my entire face. This mask does a really good job drawing gunk to the surface. I can see my pores through the mask in some places, and it gets darker where oil is being drawn to the surface. Because it is drawing things to the surface, it can create a bit of an it gets worse before it gets better effect on the skin, so I did notice some new blemishes after using. When washing off, I really like the volcanic clusters because they help scrub your face to provide some additional exfoliation as you're washing it off the face. Overall, this is one of the best clay masks I've ever used because it works exactly how I want my clay masks to work: absorbs oil, shrinks pores, isn't overly drying, and is obviously drawing things out of my pores and to the surface of my skin."

			"review_text": "This Jeju Super Volcanic Clay Mask was gifted by Innisfree to review!  This clay mask is deep cleansing; formulated with absorbent Jeju Super Volcanic Clusters and AHA, that helps clear pores while it exfoliates.  Ingredients: Their key ingredient Jeju Volcanic Clusters, are finely ground hardened volcanic lava that helps absorb excess sebum. While Lactic Acid exfoliates dead skin cells and minimizes the appearance of pores.  Now this product, like a few other controversial products does contain Walnut shell in powder form. It’s not very high on the ingredient list, and unlike other brands that have use it in exfoliators- this mask isn’t rubbed excessively over the face in scrubbing motions, so I don’t think the skin will suffer from any lesions it can make. However, I DO know that people can be allergic to this ingredient so I would definitely be careful if you have had any allergic reactions to nuts or skincare products containing nuts!  My Experience: I actually quite enjoyed this mask. It was thick in texture and easy to apply with fingers or a spatula. It didn’t dry to some hard rock like texture, which I loved because I hate feeling like my facial movements get restricted. It was easy to rinse off after 15 minutes with warm water and I have zero complaints about my skin!"

I love this mask!   This product is especially good for oily skin, which I don’t have. But if you do, you’ll love this.   The container it came in is awesome! Once I’m finished with the product, I’ll clean and reuse the jar for something else because it’s so cute.   The mask has a slight sense that is light and airy. It’s definitely not overwhelming.

I was happy to accept and to review since I had used it in 2019 and enjoyed it.  My ipsy one didn't say 2x so I thought it was different, it was not.  I really enjoy this mask.  I have very dry and sensitive skin and this leaves me feel super soft and actually a bit hydrated.  It also helps clear away dry patches.  It has a slight  mud mask smell but its so faint you can barely tell.  I have a good sense of smell and its very light.  This mask does have a tendency to pull impurities out of your skin so for me I find I get several break outs 2-3 days after using it.  You can use it as an all over face mask or even a spot treatment.  I was shocked at how inexpensive it was compared to other mask's I like that are double if not triple the price so I can see myself re-buying this when I run out of the newest one I have.  It comes in a cardboard box and the tub is actually plastic which is nice.  Its a heavy little guy so you get a ton of mask in this product, enough to mask twice a week for several months."

It is formulated with natural ingredients including Jeju which has helped with my large pores. It is a great exfoliant as well which leaves the skin super hydrated after each use. After 3 applications, my pores now look much smaller. I have been using it twice a week and each time, I left it on for 15 minutes. If you want to get a soothing sensation, you can keep the mask in the refrigerator, and it will last longer. Highly recommend this if you are looking for a clay mask with purifying properties"

Both of which are great clarifying and astringent agents. After using the mask I noticed a great difference in the appearance of my skin. My skin looks more bright and feels clean and soft after using this mask. I noticed there are AHA in this product which helps with exfoliation of dead skin cells. It also has glycerin which is a humectant and helps moisturize the skin. Unlike other clay masks, this degreases the skin without drying it out. Last thing to mention is that I did not notice a fragrance, and it comes in a big jar that lasts a while."

Innisfree gifted me the Innisfree Pore Clearing Clay 2X with Super Volcanic Clusters to test and review. I was really excited to try this mask out because I found it to be very interesting that its formulated with super volcanic clusters. I applied the mask on my freshly cleansed face and I found the clay mask to be very comfortable on the skin. It’s feels very lightweight on the skin. On my cheek area, I found the mask to feel a little tightening but it’s most likely because that area of my face is the softest.  I love how soft and creamy the texture of the mask feels when I’m applying it unto my skin. It dries fairly quickly when applied. I usually just leave the clay mask on for about ten minutes and I use this product twice a week and so far I’m seeing great results to my skin. I found that cleansing the mask off in luke warm water was a breeze. After continue use, I’ve noticed that my pores have dramatically diminished. I can barely see my pores and my skin feels very smooth to the touch. Other face masks can be too drying on my skin. Innisfree Pore Clearing Clay Mask doesn’t dry out my skin at all. It’s the best clay mask I’ve tried as of yet and I’ve implemented it into my everyday skincare routine."

Packaging was easy to open and easy to close, even with wet hands. My face didn’t feel overly dry even after taking it off. I notice that my pores were reduced in size and I even rubbed toner across my face to see if anything was left and sure enough, every bit of dirt was off my face.

I was genuinely hesitant to try this mask because it contains walnut shell powder. However, I still decided to try it and I was not disappointed! It applied so nicely on my skin—super buttery and smooth clay but there are some small grainy pieces. I only left it on for 5-7 minutes because it started to tingle (probably because of the lactic acid) and it was already dried. I had to wash it off super carefully and gently because I was scared that the grainy pieces were going to damage my skin. However, once I finished washing the mask off, my skin was SO smooth. It did irritate a pimple that was on my face but that didn’t bother me because my skin has never felt smoother. My pores were also invisible as well. I this mask is such a good mask to have if you do not have sensitive skin and you want to exfoliate and clean out your pores! I really liked this mask but I will probably not use it too often, as it is a very strong exfoliant for my skin."

Clay masks can sometimes be a little too drying to my skin (especially with seasonal changes) but this one left my skin feeling clean and refreshed.

			"review_text": "Packaging: The packaging is nice and attractive, it comes in a small jar which is easy to open by twisting anticlockwise. The jar is lightweight and compact which makes it easy to take it on the go.  Usage: We all know the benefits of using the clay masks, it rejuvenates, exfoliates, stimulates, and improves circulation in our skin. I have sensitive-combination skin it works great on my skin. I really like this multipurpose clay mask which exfoliates, cleanse and brighten the skin. This has a soft creamy formula that spreads evenly on the skin. It is enriched with finely grounded Jeju Volcanic clusters and lactic acid which absorbs all the oils from the skin, exfoliates dead cells, and minimizes the appearance of pores. This is easy to use all you need a quarter-sized scoop out of clay and Spread the mask evenly on your face and neck. Leave it on for about 10 minutes and then rinse it off with lukewarm water. This removes all dead skins and deeply cleanses the skin by removing dirt, soaks up excess oils, and unclogs the pores. I see a difference in my skin in just after a few uses, my skin looks so clean, fresh, and smooth. It gives a natural and healthy glow to the skin. It cleanses the face thoroughly and it does not dry out the skin like other clay masks. This is free from all the chemicals and works absolutely fine for every skin type. Use this mask 1-2 times a week to get the best results. Overall I am happy with this and highly recommend this to everyone to go be it a try you will definitely see the good results after a few uses.   Make sure you apply the moisturizer after washing, to moisten the skin. I got this complimentary from Innisfree. However, all the opinions are my own."

It’s amazing to get rid of that dull skin from wearing a mask all day! It cleans out my pores and leaves my skin super matte. It is quite drying though because it takes out EVERYTHING from your skin (all impurities) so I highly recommend going in with a heavy moisturizer afterwards! The volcanic clusters really do their job. I highly recommend this for a weekly face mask for those with combination to oily skin."

This is a thick, rich clay mask that contains real Jeju volcanic clusters as well as AHA(Alpha hydroxy acids) that work to exfoliate the skin and clear pores. The jar is quite small but a little goes a long way and there is quite a good amount of product in the jar despite how small it looks. I have dry skin but this product has actually worked really well with my skin type and hasn't overly dried it, nor has it irritated my skin. I apply an even layer on my skin and leave it on for around 15 minutes then rinse it off-- it doesn't Harden to an uncomfortable level like some masks which I really enjoy. After every use my skin looks noticeably healthier and feels so smooth and soft. I've also noticed a decrease in the pores around my nose, which I'm very happy about. If you have dry skin like I do I would recommend using it once a week to not overdo it."

This is a deep-cleansing creamy clay mask—formulated with absorbent Jeju Super Volcanic Clusters™ and AHA—that helps clear pores while it exfoliates. I have a huge problem with my enlarged pores and blackheads. I used this mask on clean skin and it felt light for a clay mask and good on the skin. My skin definitely felt smoother after the first use. Applying it to my face it actually felt grainy, which I was surprised about. You want to be gentle when using this mask because it tends to be a bit abrasive to the skin. It has a really nice cooling effect that lasts even after you've washed it off. Based off my first impression, I really love this mask so far. I love how smooth this mask makes my face and every time I use it my skin feels immediately so much softer. I would say if you have dry skin (I do), just use it on your areas with enlarged pores. I just like to use it on my T-zone. My nose and chin really are my problem areas and this mask definitely helps clean them out and hopefully reduce black/white heads over time."

Other masks really turn my skin super dry on application ,though I have combination skin still I feel the dryness, which was not the case with Super Volcanic Clusters Pore Clearing Clay Mask. I am really pleasingly surprised n just one application I could feel the difference in my skin. My face looked for clean, no greasy or dry feel, the moisturizer absorbed to my skin so well that my face glowed more with health as its more hydrated now.  It worked as a face scrubber plus mask. I can surely recommend this mask ."

It absorbs excessive oils, it's full of minerals, and is a natural exfoliator due to fragments of lava that hardened into Volcanic Clusters.  You want to be gentle when using this mask because it tends to be a bit abrasive to the skin. I applied mine with a spatula because this one does not come with one.  It's best not to put your fingers directly into a jar of facial product to avoid spreading bacteria.  You can leave this on 15-20 minutes to get the full benefits from it.  I left mine on for about 15 minutes then gently washed away with warm water.  It left my normal skin feeling a bit dried out but also extremely soft to the touch. After applying serum and moisturizer my skin felt terrific. I recommend this product to those without extremely sensitive or dry skin because again,  it's a bit abrasive and it does remove natural oils."

This is unscented and cruelty free. It is easy to apply and best results if you work fast and create an even application. I didnt see any crumbling or any itchy sensations during the 10 minute wait time like I have experienced with other clay rinse off masks. It dries quickly and at the end of 10 minutes my skin feels slightly firmer. Upon rinsing off it was easy and washes away leaving my skin very soft. Feels renewing and rejuvenating. This is a unique clay mask because it has volcanic clusters. It is not that noticable to see the clusters while applying but rather when rinsing this off it is like a light exfoliating without stripping my skin and not drying it out. I really enjoy this and plan to use a couple times per week. I have combo skin type and it works out great. Added clarity and smoother skin. I am always impressed by Innisfree products!"

First of all, I really like the slick packaging, it is a matte black glass jar.  The clay mask applied smoothly and offered a slight scent which is pleasant. I have sensitive skin so sometimes clay masks can be too much for me. They either have strong smells or they burn my skin when I have it on. I left the clay mask on for 10 minutes as instructed, I did feel a cooling sensation while I had it on but it did not cause any rash or discomfort. I massaged it a little bit before washing it off. It left my face feeling clean but not tightening to the point it hurts."

I’ve tried other pore clearing masks and this one is by far the best I’ve tried. I struggle a lot with my pores and this will definitely be my go to face mask. It’s also way better than pore strips. Pore strips hurt and barely do anything but this mask is amazing. It applies smoothly and evenly on the skin especially with a silicone mask brush I have. The packaging is also amazing it’s high quality and I truly love anything from innisfree.  This is a wash off mask so if you don’t like wash off masks it’s not the one for you but if you’re willing to try a wash off mask definitely try this one. I feel that a face mask couldn’t get any better than this one. I also struggle with acne so I’m hoping this mask will help with that a little in the long-run too. It also comes with 3.38 fl. oz./100mL which is a great amount. I’ve never had a mask with that much product before it’s amazing. It’s basically filled to the brim too so definitely get the amount of product plus more for the price."

My holy grail mask is a volcanic mask from a name brand, except several times the cost of the innisfree clay mask, so I was definitely interested in putting the Super Volcanic Clusters Pore Clearing Clay Mask to the test. The innisfree mask is an easy to apply, medium consistency product. I did not feel tightening of my face as it dried. Once I washed my face, I ran my hands over my face and did not feel the amazing softness I feel with my HG mask, but I am still pleased with this product and will alternate between both products so I can stretch out my other mask. I did not see any immediate changes and for me, I prefer that with a mask product. Given more uses, I may feel differently, but as of now, I am undecided if I will purchase this product after this jar runs out. I received this product from innisfree for review purposes."

It's a pretty small jar, only 3.38 ounces, but a little goes a long way. I have used it twice so far on my entire face and there's only a small amount missing from the jar. It gives you such a luxurious feeling and leaves your skin looking noticeably better, less oily, almost a matte finish and definitely cleaner after just one use. When dry, the mask doesn't tingle and it gives you a minimal tightening sensation, nothing too crazy or uncomfortable. When it's time to wash it off, you just get your fingers wet with warm water and swirl it around. It has a very soft, fine exfoliating effect. The volcanic clusters help absorb extra sebum and the AHA helps to exfoliate and minimize pore size. To use, I put this on my face and let it sit 15-20 minutes. This clay mask worked great for my combination skin. What I also love about Innisfree is that it’s a great, very affordable brand delivering effective products!"

Have purchased this twice before getting it as a gift to review! This is a great clay mask that contains volcanic ash from a volcano in South Korea. It also contains lactic acid to help dissolve away dead skin cells as well as combining 6 different skin concerns into this one mask. I use this product by first making sure my skin is clean by using a face wash first, then when my skin is still lightly damp, I put the mask onto my face. You only need a little bit each time, so a little really goes a long way. U can keep the mask on up to 15 minutes and will maybe feel a tight and light tingling, cooling sensation. After you remove the mask, your face will be chilly and clean. I love that this mask doesn't strip the skin and actually gives your face a pretty moisturized feeling afterwards. The only downside is that since the mask is grey, it'll stain and dry out your face clothes if you choose to use then when removing your mask. I light to wet a clothes and massage it into my skin to remove the mask so it'll exfoliate my skin too. I would suggest using an older face clothe or one that isn't too light in color since it isn't the most gentle on clothes."

It hydrated and makes my skin looks younger. Amazing mask . The mask was gifted by innisfree. Thank you"

One swipe out of the container and a couple of extra dabs for less than covered spots, and my face was as coated as it need be. Truly impressed by how dense it is. The texture isn't uncomfortable or overly tightening either. Rinsed off easily, and be sure to massage it into the skin before a complete rinse.   I only felt cooling around my mouth, but this isn't a deal breaker for me as I wasn't really looking for that. The pore factor yes, and this it did well. Some of them are straight up blurred -- seemingly non-existent. And it did take out smaller black heads and sebaecous filaments.  Is it a miracle? No. Is it worth the price however? 100% yes. For the record I do use a lot of other skin care products, so this isn't going to cure your large pores, black heads, sebaecious filaments, etc. It might help though!"

It got to the point that I could squeeze any random spot on my cheek and my pores would expel tons of gunk. I did a ton of online research and purchased the following products: - Murad Clarifying Cleanser - Innisfree Super Volcanic Clusters Pore Clearing Clay Mask - Peace Out Salicylic Acid Acne Treatment Serum  I’m four days in and have noticed an immediate difference in my skin. I use the cleanser, with a cleaning brush, and serum twice a day, but have only used the mask once.

There is a tingling sensation when you put it on and it still does manage to draw things out and leave your face feeling super-clean. I use this once a week at most because I don't like drying out my already dry skin, but it definitely feels like it pulls stuff up. In the long term, this is a good once-in-a-white product for people who are battling long-term acne and are still waiting for their prescriptions to finish purging.

I have been getting crazy blackheads from wearing my mask all day at work, so I needed something to help! I am astounded with how well this worked. My under the chin and chin blackheads are gone and it made it super easy to extract the blackheads on my nose. The lactic acid and very fine walnut shell *powder* (not shards of shell) gently exfoliated, so my skin was nice and smooth and I followed with a hydrating mask. *TIP* I also used the Caudalie Beauty Elixir (though you could use a spray bottle with water) to not let the mask fully dry, this helps prevent a clay mask from drying out my skin. I can be sensitive to some physical exfoliants, but my skin didn’t react adversely. Definitely a must have!"

It does have walnut shell powder in it which some say can cause micro tears however, in truth any physical exfoliant has the ability to damage the skin if it’s harsh. I found this to be on the gentler side. I also want to mention the price which I was very pleasantly surprised by at 15 dollars.

First, I used a face wash cleanser, then a toner, then I used the sample I received in my order. It is really thick and creamy. Rubbing it onto my face was very buttery and smooth. I know that the instructions say to leave the mask on for 10 minutes, but I was reading a chapter in my book, so it took me 30 minutes. There really was a cooling sensation as advertised. The mask became hard and started creasing, which made me happy that it was soaking into my skin and cleaning it and that's it time to rinse off. It did take a lot of effort to wet it and rinse it off my face because it's thick, then again, I'm glad that it wasn't thin and watery, so I won't complain much, just notifying you....the finished result was my skin feeling OH SO SMOOTH and matte. My oily skin wasn't shiny like a glazed donut anymore! I highly recommend this product and would even buy it. I just saw the price and think it's worth it. One of the budget friendly charcoal masks on Sephora (that actually works)!!!!!"

I was able to go in and remove any previously stubborn blackheads and clear out some clogged pores. I will definitely be buying the full sized version. And the price range for this brand is simply unbeatable. I am looking forward to trying more from Innisfree. Also it is pretty thick, but spreads easily- so a little goes a long way.

After a couple of minutes of sitting on the face, it has this subtle cooling sensation and you can really feel it when you go to wash the mask off which I really like as well. Gives you spa vibes. After washing off the mask after my first initial use, I noticed I had two, small red pimples on my right cheek that weren't there before and that's when I realized this stuff really pulls the gunk out!

The clay itself seems to deep clean my skin but without leaving it tight or dry like other masks I have used, and that is due to the green tea in the ingredients I think. I feel like it tightened my pores and made my makeup look better the next day.  Another thing I really like is this is a very thick consistency of a clay mask in a cute little jar, and it is very easy to apply to your face. A little goes a long way with this product. I'd recommend this to anyone who is looking for a clay mask to keep their pores clear but also not overly dry, maybe good for combination skin types like mine.

This clay mask worked great for my combination skin. I like to apply the mask on clean (dry skin) and wait around 10-15mins for it to completely dry (as the mask dries, it gives of a cool tightening effect that I enjoy). Then I like to take a little warm water and massage my skin in circular motions (1-2mins) and then wash off with lukewarm water. Overall I really enjoy this mask! The packaging is small (perfect for travel) but since you need just a little per use (I use this mask 2x a week), this bottle should last a while. Its a super gentle formula that doesn’t dry out my face and leaves my skin feeling super smooth. Not to mention it’s sooo affordable!! I highly recommend!"

It's very easy to spread and one thin coat will get the job done. It has no scent, which I LOVE, and it dries quickly. When it's time to wash it off, you get your fingers wet with warm water and swirl it around, and this has a very soft, fine exfoliating effect. I have fairly large pores on my nose, but they are noticeably smaller and my face is less oily after using this mask. I honestly love it. I try a lot of skincare products and generally end up using them once and forgetting about them, but I genuinely love this product so much that I will use this entire tub and then buy another one."

Feel: The most important thing for me with clarifying masks is that they don't burn the skin as they dry and this was very gentile. Time: It took about 10 minutes to completely dry and had the usual clay mask feel. Removal: I definitely think it's not an easily removed mask and it took a few passes of water and scrubbing to get it off.  Result: My skin felt very clean, I saw a reduction in my pores immediately.

I really loved how smooth the packaging was and the fact that the product didn't have a strong scent - a bit on the earthy side but almost undetectable. It was extremely easy to spread over my skin and washed off with ease. After just one use my skin appeared just oily and noticed a marginal difference in the size of my pores."

Normally clay masks leave my dry skin feeling really tight and extra dry, but this product didn't do that at all.  It didn't feel harsh or stripping and left my skin smooth and clean.   To use, I put this on my face and let it sit 10-15 minutes then massaged into a lather before rinsing.  It's also important to note that there isn't much of a scent with this product.  Normally I get some kind of burning or minor irritation from the majority of the masks I use, but this one was such a breeze and didn't cause me any issues.  It cleaned my pores and left my skin glowing!  There was no redness or irritation after, either. I didn't feel like I needed to slather my face is a thick, heavy moisturizer after using which I really love because it gives me more freedom of when I can use it.  This mask is definitely a winner and I couldn't be more impressed with Innisfree."

			"review_text": "I received this product complimentary from Innisfree, however my reviews are always 100% honest.   Out of all the products in the Innisfree Pore Clearing line, this one is my absolute favorite for a couple of reasons:  1) This product actually works! I have combination skin with my t-zone being oily while other parts of my face can be dry/flaky if I do not both chemically and manually exfoliate routinely. This mask was gentle enough to use all over my face - it worked well at balancing my oily t-zone while also not being too drying on the other areas of my face.  2) The formulation is just amazing - lots of chemical exfoliants are present in additional to the mechanical exfoliants, making this a great product for weekly use to give your skin an instant refresher. What makes this product even better? It has zero questionable ingredients in it including the absence of parfum/fragrance.   3) The price point for the quality. I have tried so many products similar to this over the past couple years that can be upwards of 3-5 times the price of this one, and actually prefer this/find it equitable to a few of the more premium-priced comparable.  All in all, I definitely would recommend this for pretty much anyone. I also have sensitive skin and did not find this to be irritating, or cause any redness whatsoever, hence just another reason why I gave this a solid 5/5."

I assumed they would all be great for my skin. I struggle with small blackheads from time to time and occasional acne. After getting my skin care routine in order it has really helped to balance out my skin and I have not gotten acne and only have occasional blackheads. So I like to use a charcoal or clay mask 1-2x a week to clean all of the sebum out of my pores. I think everyone should use a charcoal or clay mask atleast once a week-no matter what skin type you are!! Seeing that this mask had clay and volcanic ash made me really interested in trying it! I can honestly say I have never tried a product with volcanic ash. The mask was somewhat hard to apply to my skin. It was creamy but it was very dry. I was able to cover my entire face, I am just used to very creamy masks. Applying it to my face it actually felt grainy, which I was surprised about. It felt fine while I had it on for the 10 minutes. It did not burn or bother my skin at all. Once it came time to rinse it off was when I noticed a HUGE problem! It actually HURT to rinse off! It felt like tiny pieces of glass while rinsing my face!!! I have used exfoliating masks before like the Origins Rose clay mask that uses jojoba beads (very good ingredient for exfoliating!) I have also used sugar and coffee scrubs but realized that they are too harsh for skin. I went to look up the ingredients in this mask and it contains WALNUT SHELL POWDER!!!! That is HARSH on skin and it is no wonder it hurt my face while rinsing it off!!!! Through out the entire day my skin felt and looked inflamed, it burnt and it did feel like there were tiny scratches all over it!!! I used a moisturizing mask immediately afterward and layered on heavy moisturizer after that and again at night. I will NEVER use a mask with shell powder, sugar or coffee again!!!"

I had a sample of this that I used 3 times and I was really pleased with the results, smooth, clean skin and visibly smaller pores. It is a thinner consistency so it's easy to apply and also remove. I like this just as much as my Origins charcoal mask or my Fresh umbrian clay mask, so I checked Sephora to see the price of the full size. 15$!? I ordered one right away, as I feel it gives me the same results as the other two, more expensive options. Also, it has no fragrance which is nice. Highly Recommend!!"

I love to use this mask after taking a warm bath, so that my pores are open and ready for it. I don't know, but it gives you such a luxurious feeling, and leaves your skin visibly better, less oily, almost matte and cleaner after one use.   When dry, this clay mask doesn't tingles and gives you a minimal tightening sensation, nothing crazy nor uncomfortable. My skin looks amazingly good and juvenile after every use, that I just want you to experience it for yourself.  Recommended!!!"

They both already have lactic acid in it so I think the addition of salicylic acid is a bit over kill, definitely go with this one if you have more sensitive skin as this is was not harsh on my skin at all. I actually fell asleep with this one for a few hours and my skin did not dry out. I definitely notice a reduction of pores and maybe about 10 minutes after washing off, I notice more blackheads on my skin coming to the surface that I then use my fingers or a tool to extract."

I have combination type skin and suffer from the occasional breakout... this product truly delivers immediate results! Afterwards, my bumps have significantly decreased and my pores are almost non-existent!! Unlike other clay masks, this does not make your skin feel tight while it's on or after washing it, so it's safe for sensitive skin. Definitely reccommend this over other masks!"
