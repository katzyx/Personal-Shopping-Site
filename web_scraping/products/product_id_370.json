I tried it again this week, and again, the same results - break out badly, and now will take time for my skin to recover.

I used shade 2.5N which I felt was the perfect match for my skin tone. I used this for about three months before reviewing. This is a great option for anyone looking for a high-quality, easy-to-use foundation. The product has a lovely, subtle fragrance that adds a luxurious touch without being overwhelming, and the sleek, cute packaging makes it feel even more special. The stick format is incredibly convenient, allowing for quick and precise application, and it blends effortlessly for a natural finish. One of its best features is that it doesn’t feel cakey on the skin, offering solid coverage without a heavy feel. However, I’ve noticed that sometimes it doesn’t sit evenly, especially on drier or textured areas of my skin, which requires a little extra attention during application to ensure a smooth finish. Overall, it’s a reliable and user-friendly product that delivers a beautiful look, but it’s important to prep your skin well for best results."

			"review_text": "I used to use exclusively Dior but branched out since the pandemic. Generally speaking, I think Dior makes solid complexion products for my skin tone/type but this one stands out to me. Personally, I hate doing a full face of makeup everyday and this toes the line perfectly for a daily concealer/foundation. I swipe under my eyes and a little on my forehead and chin, then blend with my fingers and I look a bit more put together. Overall, I love how versatile this product is, I can use a brush or beauty blender or just my fingers when applying; and I can use it as a targeted concealer with my regular foundation. I especially like how the formula feels very light and more like skincare than layering a thick liquid on my face. It's a convenient size to throw in my purse compared to other foundations that I was unlikely to reapply throughout the day. 10/10 from me."

I notice I don't really need much product to even out my skin tone. It smooths out beautifully, works well with my other products (Makeup by Mario bronzer, Natasha Denona concealer, and Patrick Ta blush). It lasts ALL DAY. It doesn't cling to dry patches, it doesn't break up in my T-zone, and makes my skin look yummy and hydrated. Note that I haven't used setting powder with it, just the One Size setting spray.

It blends nicely, and the finish is more satin. I had to mix mine and sheer it to make it work. It's also very pricy for the small amount, but that's to be expended with luxury brands. Maybe I would have had better results if I had gotten a lighter shade. Overall, if you're in the market for a Lux Stick foundation, this is pretty on par with others."

I'm pretty oily and foundation tends to separate towards the end of the day, but this one is surprisingly hardy (not perfect, but I'm veryyyy oily). I pair this with the danessa myricks translucent blurring balm powder and blend it out with the dense saie buffing brush and my skin looks phenomenal and like I'm not wearing anything.

I am very fair complected and I usually have to order the lightest shade in most makeup products but this one was actually a little too light for a skin tone and makes me look a little more ghostly than usual. I do appreciate a line that offers a wide range in terms of skin tones though because finding shades that aren’t too dark for me can be really challenging. That being said, the foundation is very buildable and provides decent coverage to the face. It is easy to use and blends fairly well. It does leave the skin on my face feeling a little weird. In some areas my skin ends up being a bit dry and in other areas, I think my skin tends to get more oily. The makeup doesn’t really set well either so I wouldn’t say that it is as long lasting as some of the other makeup products I’ve used in the past. I’m not a huge fan of the fact the product is scented either but at least it is a subtle, pleasant scent. Overall, it’s decent but I’m undecided on whether I would want to buy it."

I even set it with powder and after 5 hours, I was so oily looking and I could see the foundation breaking down. it doesnt set on its own and even with powder, it transfered when I touched it. i didn't  love the scent but i like that it dissipates quickly and that it didn't break me out. it's also really expensive for how much product you get. it only has 3/4 of an inch of product."

But, it worked for me just fine. Granted, I’ve had a tan while using it, but in the future I wouldn’t want to pick a color based on the color matching chart online, because going off of that, the color I picked should’ve been way too dark.

I wouldn’t say that it was an exact color match for me.    ‭The undertone of 1.5N leans towards a yellow or warm-toned ‬undertone. I was surprised to see that it swatched lighter on me than the 1N shade.  The foundation sticks have a medium consistency that builds up to full coverage pretty much immediately. If you have dry skin, my recommendation is to not apply too much and keep it really light in coverage.   To get a natural look: moisturize beforehand to minimize any texture from dry skin. Place a couple of lightly applied dots across your T-Zone and any red areas before blending out with a sponge. Finish with hyaluronic setting spray.

			"review_text": "Shade Name: ‭1 N‬ ‭Neutral – Very light with neutral undertones.‬   Actual Shade: ‭Closer to a light-tan, cool-toned neutral. This is not a fair or lighter skin ‬shade and it does not directly correspond to what is typically expected from a 1N shade in other brands. For reference, I usually wear a Glossier G11 or a Make Up For Ever Y225 and this shade is NOT a color match for those.   ‭ Undertone: Shade 1 leans towards a peachy undertone with cool-‬toned elements.   ‭ Color Depth: Despite expectations based on numbering, ‬Shade 1N appears to be a darker shade than 1.5N due to its undertone. This shade may be better suited for someone with the lightest “tan” skin tone because of its deeper, peachy hue.‭ I would ‬say that Dior’s 1N may reach up to 2.5x darker than your average 1N shade.    ‭Swatch Recommendation: ‬  - ‭The product looks different on the skin than how it appears in the ‬tube. - ‭Swatch in person. Test on your face and neck, not your just on ‬your wrist or hand. Test on spots of redness and on your T-Zone to know for sure if a cool-toned neutral is right for you. Compare it against your neck to see if it looks too dark. - ‭Swatch directly on your neck if you struggle to see tone ‬differences in various lighting situations.   Consistency: The Dior foundation sticks are of a medium to thick consistency, yet are still soft, creamy, and ultra-blendable.   Scent:  The foundation has a subtle scent of blooming iris flowers that I found to be very refreshing and pleasant. I personally love that they’re scented, as it adds that extra luxurious touch that you don’t often see brands bother with. My combo-dry skin didn’t experience any sensitivity or irritation from the added scent ingredients.   Full coverage: These foundation sticks are marketed as buildable to full coverage, but I personally found that it’s too easy to reach that full-coverage point and end up accidentally applying too much product onto the skin. (Don’t draw lines, just blend out a few dots!)"

I would recommend this especially if you're looking for a quick and easy product."

Dior is a staple in my makeup collection so I was extremely excited to test out this new product! Packaging is so lux and smell is divine (per usual). Upon initial application I was surprised because it felt so heavy. I have large pores on my nose with combo skin and this foundation didn’t do me any favors… it sank into my pores while also weirdly sitting on other parts of my face. Most of it slipped off my face after a few hours of wear. I thought it might’ve been my skincare so tried it multiple times with various products.  In short, I had the best results when I used a gripping primer followed by a pore filling primer and used a dense brush.  I’d say the coverage is buildable with a natural, radiant leaning finish. With proper priming and setting it does withstand the Texas heat!  Do I recommend it- depends… if you’re looking for an aesthetic makeup product to display on your vanity- yes! For me, I probably stick to my other Dior products. I just feel that for the price I shouldn’t have to try so hard to make it work. Not a bad product, just not for me.   *this product was sent to me by Influenster in exchange for an honest review."

Whether I’m going for a soft everyday look or need something a little more glam, Dior Forever Skin Perfect has me covered (literally!).

As with high end products, this does have a scent which fades once you put it on but I still think it’s unnecessary to have scented makeup. The formula itself is easy to spread, but it is slightly thick. I could tell right away that it was not the best color match but that doesn’t affect my opinion. Blending it out was fine and the coverage is a little more than sheer. I applied it a couple of different ways both times straight on to the skin with the stick but I tried once to blend with my sponge and then with a brush. The time with the sponge looked a little better blended out than with a brush. I wore this three times, once without primer, once with primer & again without. On my skin, it lasted a good 6 hours without the primer, as I usually wear face makeup without it, before it started to look a little cakey. With primer, it seemed to stay a little more but not much. Everyone’s skin is different so your mileage may vary there. Overall, I don’t think this converted me into a stick foundation person and it’s not a favorite, it’s just average. If you can test it in store, then it’s worth checking out."

The coverage is great. Typically I’m only looking for a light cover and will do the stick very lightly and blend it in, but it would also be easy to lay on thicker if you’re looking for high-coverage. I’ve been noticing if I use it on top of my skincare routine it’s easy to have a Dewey finish, but I’ve also tried it when my skincare has been set and it leaves a more matte like finish. Highly recommend!"

At first glance, the packaging makes it seem like you're getting a lot of product, but once you twist it out, it’s clear that the amount inside is quite deceiving. There's far less foundation than you'd expect for the price, which is frustrating given how amazing the formula is. Dior, if you’re reading this, please consider giving us more product in the stick!"

It would be a shade that I could possibly wear during the summer if I am out in the sun a lot, as it matches my really tan skin. 🖤  This summer I was inside more so it was too dark for me. I did however do a few wear tests inside and really like the creamy formula, dreamy scent and how Dior Forever Skin Perfect wears on my dry, maturing skin. I have also used it as contour so that I don’t waste it and it’s worked really well as a contour for me. 🖤  I definitely will purchase this in a more idea shade. 🖤"

I feel like this will be perfect for the winter months, just maybe a little too luminous for summer/fall in Vegas…it’s still hot af. I’m going to continue wearing though!"

The coverage is very blendable and I really like the fact it's in a stick, making it easier to travel with.  BUT my one big issue is pretty darn big. I love fragrance in products but this one is so strong. And it lingers. If you are sensitive to fragrance, I, with a heavy heart, cannot recommend this one.  Honestly, I think the fragrance can be a major turn off for most people. But if you can handle a floral fragrance, this formula is stunning.

As pictured I am unfortunately breaking out BAD atm but aside from that the actual product does what it says , I have dry sensitive acne prone skin and this didn’t irritate me one bit , no lines or pores were emphasized given it claims to be blurring I’m really impressed , HOWEVER for me the concealing claim was not gonna do the job for my under eyes I’ve added my pic with one under eye w and w/o the Dior stick. My last criticism is that it showed up and the product was loose from the packaging and smudged but I was able to snap it back in pretty easily so I’d say maybe a one off but I’ve been wanting to sample a Dior foundation for awhile now and this has definitely made their base products seem promising and this is a beautiful skin like foundation stick perfect for everyday and awesome for travel and touch ups, Great job Dior"

Dior Forever Skin Perfect Foundation Stick in Shade 1N  I’ve been using the Dior Forever Skin Perfect Foundation Stick in shade 1N for a few weeks now, and I’m absolutely impressed. As someone with fair skin, finding the perfect match can be tricky, but 1N blends seamlessly with my complexion.  The texture is incredibly smooth, gliding effortlessly over my skin without feeling heavy or cakey. I love how versatile this stick is; it’s perfect for both full coverage and light touch-ups throughout the day. The finish is natural with a subtle glow, which I appreciate since it doesn’t look overly matte or dewy—just a nice, healthy radiance.  One of my favorite things about this product is its portability. The stick format makes it super easy to carry in my bag, and it’s great for quick touch-ups on the go. It also doubles as a concealer, which is a huge plus for me.  Overall, the Dior Forever Skin Perfect Foundation Stick in 1N has become a staple in my makeup routine. It’s definitely worth the investment if you’re looking for a high-quality foundation that delivers on both performance and convenience."

However, it might be a bit difficult to remove at the end of the day... I guess that's why it offers 24 hours of coverage! On oily skin I noticed that the foundation faded sooner, and it does transfer a bit. The scent is subtle and pleasant, not overpowering, and it comes in 18 shades, giving more of a chance to find one that matches better with your skin."

The formula doesn’t emphasize texture like a lot of stick foundations tend to do. It has a heat and humidity resistant formula and definitely has a “blurring effect” on my skin. Dior claims that it can be used as foundation or as concealer for on the go touch ups. I have only used it as foundation, not as concealer but I am excited to try it in that way. This product does have a scent to it, a very luxe scent. But it does not last long and it only present when applying. The packaging is great for on the go convenience and feels luxurious. Overall, I love the effect it gave my skin and I definitely recommend. I received this product complimentary from Influenster but all opinions are my own."

I picked it in the shade 3.5N which is definitely too deep for me most of the year, but I wanted it to be a good summer shade and winter bronzer and I’m totally satisfied with it for both functions. The shade is very neutral, with appropriate depth for a 3.5 and the coverage is quite full but has a beautiful natural finish. It does deepen slightly on me after blending, but I wouldn’t call it oxidation. The coconut and other oils make this a creamy seamless application and blend though it looks gorgeous all day and doesn’t get patchy or slip and slide. It doesn’t need to be powdered on my normal/dry skin. The packaging is somewhat lighter than I would have expected, but the price and quantity is appropriate for what you get. There is a scent when first applied (typical of Dior) that fades away in moments and can’t be detected later. I adore this product and have already purchased it in my winter shade to use as concealer as well."

I even wore this while working out once accidentally. And it literally didn’t move. I can’t say enough great things.

The color still had a hint of yellow undertone even though it says cool, which may be attributed to my own skin color. Many products like Fenty and YSL always end up looking too yellow on me. Givenchy Prisme Libre and Chanel colors are a great match for me. I took off a star due to the skin irritation. I have autoimmune diseases that cause sensitive, dry skin. The scent was a bit much for me, but it is a pleasant one. Applying it… made my skin burn. Too irritating and had to return. Having said that, I think it would work well for most people with other skin types."

The convenience of this stick format makes it incredibly easy to apply and blend, whether I’m at home or touching up while out and about. The formula is creamy and glides on smoothly, giving me buildable coverage that looks natural and flawless.  What I love most is how versatile this foundation is—it’s perfect for a quick, light application, but it can also be layered for more coverage without ever feeling heavy or cakey. The finish is absolutely gorgeous—radiant yet natural, with just the right amount of glow. Plus, it’s long-lasting, keeping my skin looking fresh all day without the need for constant touch-ups.  Another huge plus is how it feels on the skin—it’s lightweight and comfortable, almost like I’m wearing nothing at all. It also doesn’t settle into fine lines or emphasize pores, which is a major win. Dior has really nailed it with this stick foundation—it’s luxurious, effective, and super easy to use. Highly recommended!"

I'm ok with that though because of how it enhances the skin. Just stunning and SO easy to blend with a damp sponge. It takes a lot to impress me - foundation-wise - but this one really is a stunner."

The finish is natural and slightly luminous, giving my skin a flawless, airbrushed look that lasts all day.  What I love most about this concealer is its versatility. It’s buildable, so I can use it for everything from spot concealing to full-face coverage when I want a more polished look. It blends seamlessly, whether I’m using a brush, sponge, or my fingers, and it doesn’t settle into fine lines or crease throughout the day.  The staying power is impressive as well. Once it’s on, it doesn’t budge, even in humid conditions or after a long day. I also appreciate that it’s infused with skincare benefits like wild pansy extract, which keeps my skin hydrated and comfortable.

It can be worn alone or set under powder, either way skin stays smooth. it doesn’t feel dry at all, yet  gives great coverage. Only small complainant is the smell, which I know is diors thing, but it could be toned down for this."

The shade matches my skin tone perfectly (a light-ish tan/medium), blending in smoothly for a natural look. It does a great job of blurring imperfections and covering breakouts.  I find it easy to apply – I just use it on specific areas of my face and blend with a brush or makeup sponge. It gives my skin a youthful appearance that I love. The finish is smooth and natural, never looking cakey or heavy.  The packaging is sleek and convenient, making it easy to carry around for touch-ups during the day. Plus, the scent is amazing and adds a nice touch to my routine.  I never really liked using foundation until now, but this product is perfect for me. If you’re looking for something that offers great coverage without feeling heavy, I highly recommend the Dior Forever Skin Perfect Foundation Stick."

I kept forgetting to grab it out of my mailbox, and finally when I did, I was surprised that its shape was still in tact. It would be perfect for someone who does their makeup in the car like I do. It does smell a bit perfume-y, so I wouldn’t recommend it to someone who is avoiding scented cosmetics. Other than that it’s great. Would try it in my true shade."

The shade range is smaller than the other foundation lines, I usually wear 2WO , but this one does not carry it so I went with 2.5n which was perfect a little lighter but nothing that bronzer can't fix, plus it will work perfectly for winter. I didn't go with 2W Because it looked a bit to warm. Other than that I LOVE this foundation and will repurchase."

A little goes a long way, but this foundation doesn't leave my face looking cakey and unnatural. I thought it would really settle into fine lines/creases and cling to dry patches a lot worse than a liquid foundation does, but that hasn't been the case.  I've tried applying it with a brush, my fingertips, and a sponge.  When applying with fingertips, it sometimes pills on my fingers, but blends effortlessly into my face and seems to melt right into my skin.  I've worn it as a concealer, using just a little bit where coverage was needed, and also have worn it as a full-faced foundation. The coverage is definitely buildable.  I think I prefer applying it only where I need it, instead of to my full face, especially during really hot summer days. It's such a good match that the edges just disappear, you can't tell where the makeup ends and my skin begins.  It seems to hold up well in humidity and while sweating, especially when using a primer. It does transfer a bit, but not nearly as much as some of the other foundations I've used.  I'm enjoying this foundation a lot more than I thought I would and I look forward to doing my makeup now because it's such a simple process compared to my normal makeup routine. Perfect for summer, perfect for travel....I've finally found a foundation that I love and will absolutely be recommending this to friends. I will be purchasing a new stick when this one is all used up."

I would not recommended this if you have sensitive skin as the perfume is overwhelming."

The first thing that struck me about Dior Foundation was its lightweight formula. It feels incredibly comfortable on the skin, almost as if I'm not wearing any makeup at all. This is a huge improvement over my previous foundation, which often felt heavy and cakey after a few hours. Dior Foundation stays put without settling into fine lines or creasing, which is a game-changer for me.  Another standout feature is its buildable coverage. Whether I'm going for a light, everyday look or a full glam finish, Dior Foundation delivers. It evens out my skin tone perfectly and covers any imperfections without looking unnatural. The finish is smooth and slightly dewy, giving my complexion a healthy, glowing appearance.  I also appreciate the range of shades available, making it easy to find a perfect match for my skin tone. It blends effortlessly, whether I use a brush, sponge, or even my fingers. Plus, it doesn't oxidize throughout the day, so the color stays true from morning to night.  Overall, Dior Foundation has become my go-to product, effortlessly replacing my old favorite. Its superior formula, excellent coverage, and beautiful finish make it a must-have in my makeup routine. I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a reliable, high-quality foundation that delivers stunning results."

It held up well for a few hours, but I have really oily skin now with the summer heat, so after maybe 4 or 5 hours I applied some quick powder to get rid of the slight oiliness. It is so easy to apply, especially when you are on the go. I recommend blending it out with a fluffy brush, but it also turned out fine with just my fingers.

The smell of this foundation is another level. I fell in love with the smell and it is loud and very nice as if you’re smelling perfume. Now, I want to talk about the product itself and how it goes on my skin. First, having a foundation stick can help a lot by applying on the face. The foundation is really blending but not full coverage. I thought that the color is not suitable for my skin color as you can see in the picture but after blending, the color blends with the skin color giving you a super natural look and keeps your skin hydrated. It didn’t last more than 2 hours outside in the hot weather. The packaging looks adorable, high quality and suitable for Dior."

First off, the packaging is timeless, chic and sleek I cannot wait to take this on my upcoming trip. Now let's get into the product, I matched the stick to my Forever Glow Foundation shade, which is 6W, so this stick is flexible meant to match a variety of shades across the various Dior foundation lines. I was skeptical but nevertheless I followed the color chart, and it definitely worked! Once blended I was left with the most beautiful natural skin like finish not too matte not too dewy it was as if I just had a great skin care regime and to have that much coverage and to still look that natural it CRAXZZY. I asked my fiancé how it looked, and he responded that had I not told him I was wearing foundation he would not have known. Just to make sure the lightning wasn't playing tricks on me, I photographed outside on a sunny day and same thing just beautiful flawless skin! I applied the Dior Contour stick; Charlotte Tilbury Flawless Finish powder the Dior filter glow on top and all these things were not needed I was basically experimenting on how well the foundation played with other products and wore this for the day which was hot and humid. I'd say I wore at least 10 hours at the end I legit did not want to wash my face off. This review is long because I want the ladies to try this. Honestly this is going to be my forever foundation I hope and pray that the only thing they do is add more shades other than that PLEASE DO NOT change this formula!!  I'm buying a backup maybe two just to be sure I'm not without it that's how much I love this stuff. Try it ladies you won't regret!"

			"review_text": "I recently tried the DIOR Forever Skin Perfect Foundation Stick in the shade 1N Neutral. Overall, I would rate this product four stars out of five. Shade: The 1N Neutral shade was a tad too dark for my complexion. I also found that the 0N shade, as pictured by the company, appeared practically white on their company photo of all the shades. This made finding the perfect match a bit challenging. Moisturization: While the foundation provided a nice finish, it did not feel as moisturizing as I had hoped, but nonetheless was so beautiful on the skin! I just happen to have dry skin so I lean for more moisturizing products.  Overall Performance: Despite these minor issues, the foundation itself is very nice and luxurious. It offers good coverage and blends well, making it a solid choice for those looking for a reliable foundation stick. I hope this feedback is helpful for future product improvements. Thank you, DIOR, for your continued commitment to quality. The packaging is adorable and is on my display!"

Product blends smoothly onto skin. Product feels lightweight on skin and does seem to blur out pores. It does have a fragrance typical Dior fragrance, doesn’t bother me. With just 1 layer I get light medium coverage and does not emphasize texture. Does build up to a medium coverage without being patchy. Has a really beautiful soft glow and natural finish.

To my surprise, it was very easy to apply and blend seamlessly into my skin.  To truly gauge its performance, I applied the Dior Forever Skin Perfect foundation stick without any primer. My T-zone tends to be dry, while the rest of my face is normal to combination. Applying 2-3 swatches across my cheeks, nose, chin, and forehead provided ample coverage that blended beautifully. However, I ended up applying a bit too much, resulting in a slightly cakey feel on my skin—this was more due to my application technique than the makeup itself.  Notably, the dry areas of my T-zone did experience some pulling, suggesting that using a hydrating primer or ensuring a well-moisturized skin beforehand would be beneficial. Even so, the foundation did impressively minimize my pores and conceal hyperpigmentation around my face.  The finish of the Dior Forever Skin Perfect foundation stick is dewy and quite beautiful, imparting a filtered, radiant look to the skin—perfect for those wanting a naturally luminous complexion.  Sensitive individuals will appreciate that this foundation is fragrance-free, catering to those with fragrance sensitivities or preferences for unscented products.  The stick packaging is exceptionally convenient for travel and touch-ups, and as depicted in the attached photo, the product quantity is generous, ensuring longevity and value for money.  The Dior Forever Skin Perfect foundation stick offers ease of application, impressive coverage, and a radiant finish. While it may require a bit of experimentation to find the ideal application technique for different skin types, its travel-friendly design and skin-enhancing properties make it a worthy addition to any makeup routine."

When this first arrived, I was so excited to try this out that I tested this on my bare skin. And when I say bare skin, I mean absolutely no skincare products or skin prep. Imagine my surprise when I was impressed to see how this performed. The foundation stick glided onto my bare face with complete ease, the creaminess of the formula was an immediate notice. I wasn’t sure how much to use, and didn’t want to use a lot as this was for mere excitement testing purposes. I didn’t need a lot of the formula to provide a full coverage experience. I simply used a beauty blender to blend, noting that it blended effortlessly. I was shook at my reflection. My bare skin. My bare dry skin. And it looked amazing. I couldn’t wait to use this legitimately, with my skincare routine and prep! You just know you have found something special when it performs that well on bare skin.   Since then, I’ve used it as I would any of my foundations. I’m in absolute awe of how my skin looks with this formula. The formula feels really nice on the skin. Feels almost natural, like I’m wearing nothing despite the insane coverage. My skin still looks like skin, but far more better. The appearance of my pores was noticeably minimized. My skin is naturally dry, so I’m happy to that this formula is hydrating. There’s no caked appearance. The formula provides an ideal version of my skin’s appearance. This stays perfectly intact throughout these hot, summer days where sweat is of the norm.   This would be a perfect foundation for me if there was SPF in it. I say that as someone who already has SPF incorporated in their routine. However, in the foundation market that is highly saturated with options varying all over the spectrum in terms of pricing, there are a lot of foundations that are a fraction of the price that offer SPF.   This is a pleasant introduction to a foundation product from Dior. I see that the hyp"

However, I have one gripe about the actual product, and that is that it is scented. I do NOT like having scented makeup products, and this has a powdery, floral scent to it. Granted, it's not super strong or overpowering, but I still don't want that all over my face.  Second, I unfortunately received the 3N shade which ended up being too dark for my skin, and also very warm, in my opinion, not neutral. This may work for me as a sort of contour or bronzer, but I'm bummed this doesn't work for my normal foundation shade."

When I received the product the outside packaging and tube was fine, but when I opened it the bullet of foundation wasn’t secured in the tube and the foundation got everywhere as shown in the photo. I believe for this product you can buy a refill and that’s why it easily pops out. Keep that in mind when purchasing online, I would recommend buying in person. The formula itself is pretty easy to work with, the foundation doesn’t have much play time so I recommend applying in sections and blending as you go. I found brush application to work the best. Finish is a soft matte/natural finish. The product works well with all of my other products and it stayed put pretty well. Most stick foundations can look cakey in my opinion, but this one really melts into the skin. The foundation has fragrance, which doesn’t bother my skin (and I like the scent!). I would recommend this product if you’re looking for a high end foundation."

However, I have one gripe about the actual product, and that is that it is scented. I do NOT like having scented makeup products, and this has a powdery, floral scent to it. Granted, it's not super strong or overpowering, but I still don't want that all over my face.  Second, I got the 3N shade which ended up being too dark and warm toned for my skin. This may work for me as a sort of contour, but I'm bummed this doesn't work for my normal foundation shade."

When this first arrived, I was so excited to try this out that I tested this on my bare skin. And when I say bare skin, I mean absolutely no skincare products or skin prep. Imagine my surprise when I was impressed to see how this performed. The foundation stick glided onto my bare face with complete ease, the creaminess of the formula was an immediate notice. I wasn’t sure how much to use, and didn’t want to use a lot as this was for mere excitement testing purposes. I didn’t need a lot of the formula to provide a full coverage experience. I simply used a beauty blender to blend, noting that it blended effortlessly. I was shook at my reflection. My bare skin. My bare dry skin. And it looked amazing. I couldn’t wait to use this legitimately, with my skincare routine and prep! You just know you have found something special when it performs that well on bare skin.   Since then, I’ve used it as I would any of my foundations. I’m in absolute awe of how my skin looks with this formula. The formula feels really nice on the skin. Feels almost natural, like I’m wearing nothing despite the insane coverage. My skin still looks like skin, but far more better. The appearance of my pores was noticeably minimized. My skin is naturally dry, so I’m happy to that this formula is hydrating. There’s no caked appearance. The formula provides an ideal version of my skin’s appearance. This stays perfectly intact throughout these hot, summer days where sweat is of the norm.   This would be a perfect foundation for me if there was SPF in it. I say that as someone who already has SPF incorporated in their routine. However, in the foundation market that is highly saturated with options varying all over the spectrum in terms of pricing, there are a lot of foundations that are a fraction of the price that offer SPF.  This is a pleasant introduction to a foundation product from Dior."

The color fits great with my skin tone. Love the effected."

Man was I surprised with this foundation stick! I put a couple swipes on my face and then blended it out with a damp beauty blender, and it just melted into my skin like butter. it is completely undetectable on the skin and gives a natural  finish. Overtime throughout the day, the coverage remains the same, which I would say is medium buildable. however, I do get a  oily throughout the day. This foundation really just looks like skin from the beginning of the day until the very end. I don’t mind that it gets oily because I prefer a dewy/natural look anyway. One thing people might not like is this does have a very strong fragrance, which is common in luxury makeup.  And of course, like with all Dior packaging, it is gorgeous.￼I was so pleasantly surprised with this foundation, and I look forward to continuing to use it!"

Dior is one of my main foundations in rotation each day, so needless to say, I was thrilled at the chance to try this foundation stick before it's even launched in stores.  The packaging is attractive with a fancy snap lid cover with a decorative silver topped cap.  The scent is Dior's typical signature scent, which is a floral smell.  It fades quickly upon application, but I don't mind the scent.  On the box, it doesn't say which application method is preferred, so I tried it using a brush and then my fingers to see which application worked best. A brush, in my opinion, sheers it out too much as it is very emollient. My fingers worked best as it gave me more control of the coverage.  It is buildable.   The shade was a bit too dark, but  I had to pick an available shade, and it was the lightest available to choose.  I pictured two swatches for comparison. The first swatch is the Dior Forever liquid foundarion in 0CR, and the second is the new foundation stick in 2CR. You can see a huge difference in the color, but fortunately for me, it's a great summer shade for when I self tan.  Once I applied it, though, I was able to sheer it out enough to where it didn't look bad.  It does have decent coverage and camouflaged my pores well, which is a deal breaker for me if it doesn't.  It is very emollient and gives a natural glow. It borders on matte but does have a radiance to it without giving the glazed donut look.  It did last all day long and stayed in place. Blush, bronzer and concealer played well with it.  I think I'd be happier if I got my actual color, but I must say, it's a nice foundation. You can't go wrong with Dior. Will definitely swatch in store once it makes its debut."

Well, I got this foundation stuck in the mail and omg! I used it as a concealer and for little touch ups here and there and it was perfect. Thank Gd, I chose the correct color. It made my skin velvety and not too slick and shiny (I prefer a matte nonshiny look.) I didn’t even have to go in for powder hours later. I get oily on my nose but that was to be expected.

I’m a foundation snob because I have combination, maturing skin - & this is EVERYTHING I need. I received this in the middle of heatwave in NYC; & this has withstood intense humidity and extreme heat ALL DAY! I don’t know what type of magic formula this is, but it’s hands down the best thing I’ve ever used. I usually use skin tints in the summer; but this is so lightweight, it’s better than a tint. A little goes a long way and it provides FULL coverage. I accidentally chose a color that was a bit lighter than my skin (1CR) and it blends like a dream. I don’t know how it manages to blend into my skin so seamlessly. I’ve used it with my fingers, a sponge, and a brush and it all works beautifully. I used it with and without a primer and it’s just magic. My skin looks flawless like I’m walking around with a blurring filter. It hydrates my skin, while giving me a matte finish. The way it blurs pores by my nose and all my little lines is straight sorcery. It’s a glowing natural finish that also conceals and brightens. It’s ideal for no-makeup makeup looks; but is also buildable for a stunning full glam look. This is worth every cent! The luxurious, gorgeous tube it comes in, is the cherry on top. Dior does it again with beauty excellence. This one was gifted free for my review, but I intend on getting color matched and using this regularly. It’s a MUST have for warmer weather!

If your dark complexion you might find it harder to find a shade since Dior only release 5 dark skin colors, I took one star off because of the lack of inclusivity.

This has a strong floral perfume scent when applying it so I wouldn’t recommend this to anyone sensitive to fragrance. I don’t know that it will be good for every skin type, I think it will give people with dry skin a lot of texture, it definitely exaggerates my dry patches and makes certain parts of my skin look worse. It has really nice coverage it will do a good job covering up discoloration and hyperpigmentation and even out the complexion. I believe this retails for around 100 dollars which is a huge step up from their other foundations. I don’t think it is better than the other luxury options that are less expensive."

			"review_text": "I received the Dior Forever Skin Perfect Foundation Stick for free from Influenster and Dior in exchange for my honest opinion.   Sadly, I was disconnected from the internet when the claim popped up, so I ended up getting a shade that’s a bit too dark for my complexion. However, I’ve been testing it out as a contour (shown in picture below!), and I really like the feel of the formula and how blendable and pigmented it is. The texture is very smooth and it's easy to apply with a brush.  I was still interested in testing this out as a foundation, so I adjusted the tone to make it lighter using a white color corrector from L.A. Girl. I mixed the foundation with the color corrector on the back of my hand and applied it with a brush. The white mixing pigment isn't supposed to change the formula or texture of the foundation, so I got a good sense of how it wears throughout the day.  Initially, it looked really beautiful on and gave a blurred/smooth look to the skin. I would say this is a medium-full coverage foundation, and I didn't have any issues layering other products on top of it. It's advertised as a 24-hour wear foundation, but in my opinion, after about 10 hours, it started looking more textured and very shiny, as you can see in the picture (I included a before and after). I have dry skin, so that was a bit surprising since I usually only notice a bit of shine around my nose after wearing makeup for longer periods (8+ hours).  Honestly, I think I prefer using this as a contour rather than a foundation. I'm not sure if the color corrector changed the formula or the way this wears throughout the day, so it would be hard to give my final opinion without trying it in my correct shade. Still, I would say that other foundations I own have lasted better throughout the day. Overall, I don't think this is a bad product—I appreciate the ease of applying a stick foundation compared to a liquid, and I will definitely continue to incorporate this into my routine as a contour."

As for the finish, I think it looks good, but I could see all my pores and I wasn’t a fan of that. So if you have texture skin like me, make sure you have a good primer and that it helps minimize the pores. That way the foundation can look more smooth.

I don’t usually wear very full coverage foundations for everyday and I feel like you have major control over this product depending on how you apply it. At first, I used a brush to blend it out and it gave a nice sheer coverage that I wanted for what has been a very hot week. Then I went in with my finger and applied a little more to some spots I had on my face and it immediately covered it! I used a hydrating primer as well as a powder over it and I didn’t notice any separation throughout the day. The cap feels pretty sturdy so I’d feel comfortable throwing it into my bag and reapplying to whatever needed it. All in all, I didn’t find this to be too heavy on my face that I immediately wanted to wash it off! I almost forgot that I was wearing anything! I highly recommend it!"
