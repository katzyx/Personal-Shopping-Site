			"review_text": "I’ve tried a lot of setting sprays in my time—some made my face feel like a grease trap, others left me looking like I’d just jumped into a pool (without the fun of swimming). But this one? It’s like a force field for my face.   First of all, let’s talk about the sprayer. I’ve never felt so pampered by something that wasn’t a spa day.   Now, for the magic: my makeup stays put. All day. ALL DAY. I went to a wedding, had a few awkward moments with the in-laws, and ended up at a bar where someone spilled a drink on me. My face? Unscathed. Meanwhile, my friend’s makeup was sliding off like it was auditioning for a role in a horror movie.   By the time I got home, I expected to look like a sad, melted version of myself, but nope. My makeup was still as intact as it was when I first applied it. I might actually start using this as a metaphor for commitment. My makeup and I are in this together, no matter how many times I accidentally rub my face on my sleeve. Or forget I used liquid blush and give my white shirt wearing boyfriend a hug.  If you’re looking for a setting spray that holds your face like it’s got a restraining order against sweat, THIS IS IT. My makeup’s got a better chance of surviving a zombie apocalypse than I ever will.  Keep in mind I definitely recommend making an impenetrable makeup shield with your setting powder of choice and this setting spray!  I hope your highlighter is blinding and your gloss is glossing 💋"

			"review_text": "*disclamer I'm basing this review on 2 time uses* i bought it mainly to keep my makeup fresh and for it to stay. let me just say it DELIVERED. i only wear cream blush and bronzer, and sometimes light concealer or hilighter. As we know, blush is usually gone after 20 mins but it stayed trough my 8h shift AND school air 💪 only down side is it did not survive my nap on the couch. my blush what pretty much gone wich is understandable. i did wear a lill bit of eyeshadow that day and it creased so bad wich never happened before. i also did set my whole face real quit with a brush and powder to even out the spray. make SURE to shake the bottle first to avoid random drops. has a light smell, not a bad smell, not a good smell but its gone after it dries"
