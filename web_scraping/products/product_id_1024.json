			"review_text": "I really like oil and solid perfumes, they seem to last a long time on me and are subtle and not up in your nose. I usually dab near my underarm so perfume is not wafting around and only people close to you will smell them. I am not keen on overly sweet florals. I have used the No. 4 Bois de Balincourt previously and love the beautiful cedar scent, however i feel it is too heavy for spring and summer. My take on the other scents in the sampler: No. 09 Vallee de Farney - nice balanced fragrance, citrusy and green and a hint of cedar No. 13 Nouvelle Vague - I probably won't use this one much, although it is nice, the coconut is redolent of the beach/sun lotion. High summer and seaside resorts only No 14 Icila -summery but not too sweet, predominantly jasmine odor Antridris Cassis - I did not like the top notes at first, almost reminded me of insect repellent. But this one gets better as it wears. Unusual, year round scent The small sample size is good for me, I don't use much, and it's perfect for daily use and travel."

			"review_text": "This is a wonderful sample set. I much prefer oil-based perfumes as in my experience they last longer, are less overwhelming, have a consistent scent, and release more fragrance if your temperature increases. The scents are very good, clean, natural, strong but gentle (fragrant, not cloying or overwhelming) and most importantly, non-toxic. Most perfumes contain harmful ingredients listed as fragrance or parfum due to trade secrets, but the lack of regulation means most designer perfumes have endocrine disrupters, carcinogens, and chemicals that can cause repro harm or dysfunction. I was so happy to read that this company is very careful about what it includes in its fragrances. This is also the first time I’ve ever tried a perfume sampler set and not immediately started sneezing at something in it. The company uses beautiful sustainable packaging and makes effort towards carbon offsets and sustainability. The ingredients are chosen to be safe for the environment and for you. The set includes unisex perfumes, although some seem more traditionally masculine or feminine to me. I and the person I am sharing this with both found several scents we really like in the sampler. This would make a great gift, especially for someone who prefers more natural fragrances. I’m looking forward to testing them out for length of wear and layering the different fragrances."
