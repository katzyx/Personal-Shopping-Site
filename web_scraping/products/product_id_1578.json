			"review_text": "T3 SinglePass Curl X has an extra long barrel making hard to reach areas easier to curl and allows you to curl larger sections too. This has 9 different heat settings at the turn of a dial. With my medium hair I use setting 3-4 but I can go up as high as 6. The tip remains cool for easy control. It’s lightweight. Auto shut off after one hour in case you forget to turn it off. The cord swivels 360 degrees so you don’t get tangled and irritated lol. And it’s traveling friendly being auto world voltage.  I love this makes curling the back of my head so much easier and quicker."
