I discovered that it's best applied to damp hair. While the product lacks clear instructions regarding application on dry or damp hair, given its watery consistency, I opted for damp hair. Living in humid Florida, I found it effective in taming frizz temporarily. However, its scent is somewhat off-putting, and I wasn't particularly fond of its texture. While it's worth trying out, personally, I didn't notice significant improvements or benefits from using this product."

What I liked was the ability to customize the products to my specific hair needs. Choosing my hair goals and fragrance was a fun touch. The shampoo did a decent job of cleaning my hair without leaving it feeling too dry.  However, the conditioner mask didn't quite live up to my expectations. While it made my hair soft, I was hoping for more defined curls, and it didn't quite deliver on that front.  Another drawback for me was the price. It's on the expensive side for hair care, and I'm not sure if the level of personalization justifies the cost.  In summary, it's not a bad product, but it didn't wow me either. If you're looking for a personalized hair care experience and don't mind the price, it might be worth a try.  Gifted by functionofbeauty"

			"review_text": "Gifted! I'm thrilled to share my experience with this remarkable anti-frizz product! Dealing with tangled curls has always been a struggle for me, but this product has completely transformed my routine. Since incorporating it into my haircare regimen, I've noticed a significant reduction in tangles and knots. Not only does it effectively combat frizz, but it also seems to create a protective barrier that prevents my curls from tangling throughout the day. This means less time spent wrestling with my hair and more time enjoying its natural beauty. I appreciate how lightweight the product is, as it doesn't weigh down my curls or leave any greasy residue. Instead, my hair feels soft, smooth, and incredibly manageable. If you're tired of battling tangles and want to embrace smooth, frizz-free curls, I can't recommend this product enough – it's a true game-changer!"
