			"review_text": "After my daughter and I used this product (about two weeks later, after using three times head washing and conditioners a week), it left soap grime in the bathtub. I have to scrub daily to avoid dealing with soap bars that flake out when they come too low. I wish the company had a soap saver bag to reduce soap grime or could specifically reformulate the soap to avoid it."
