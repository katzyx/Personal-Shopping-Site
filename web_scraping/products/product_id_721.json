It's unscented too so no irritating perfumes. I personally find it a bit rich for under makeup, so I mainly wear it on no-makeup days or at night. I was surprised by how well this moisturizer pairs with potentially drying active products! I do use a Retinol every other day, and have found applying this moisturizer about 5 mins after that has done wonders to prevent most of the irritation (dry flaky skin, redness), while still allowing the Retinol to do its thing. It's affordable too and lasts for months (a little goes a long way). I've tried far more expensive brands and still prefer this simple moisturizer hands down"

I saw the reviews and got a bit scared, but I must say, this is a lovely moisturizer. Most moisturizers I use make my skin feel oily and heavy, but not this one. It absorbs into my skin well (and fast), and my skin feels softer after using it. It doesn’t make my face look shiny so I don’t feel gross wearing just the moisturizer out in public. Don’t find that it pills or looks weird under makeup. I didn’t have an issue where it burned my face. I really hope the sale price is for cyber Monday and not because this product is being discontinued, it’s my new favourite. I definetly will repurchase. Love this, and I will check out more of this brand."

She states that I was having an allergic reaction; stop using the products and treat with Aquaphor with hydrocortisone; also, take Flonase, Claritin or Zytec to help reduce and treat the allergic reaction. It’s been two weeks as of today and my left eye does not hurt as much, the white bumps are gone, but now I developed an internal stye in the bottom lid of my left eye. Hopefully, it will resolve on its own. I returned both items , including the free samples. I’ve used The Ordinary for at least five years and never had a problem. I’ll just stick with what’s been working for my skin."

I deal with cystic acne which also triggers some skin-picking, and the surface of my skin is scarred in many places from it. I also deal with dryness and eczema patches from time to time. Needless to say I'm pretty content with this moisturizer and impressed with the brand! My skin feels quenched. Sometimes I use a second layer if I'm having a flare-up of eczema or having an itchy acne day.   When I started using this product I was also using an acne medication and literally every product I tried with any ounce of moisture power made my face burn, itch or remain dry. This was the first product that actually left me feeling good after cleansing and didn't drastically hurt my wallet. Could be I was using the wrong products before though, so I may have confirmation bias here. I've since stopped using that medication and the moisturizer remains my staple.  I've decided to try other products from the Inkey List skincare line to see if it benefits my skin in other ways, so I consider that a win!"

I came on the Sephora site and searched and landed on this one because of price and reviews (I’m not loaded - I can’t afford Tatcha. I wish.)  Here’s the thing, I don’t have sensitive skin but this made my skin react. It got red. It got irritated. The cream just feels like it sits on top of my skin, never sinking in. I have finally moved it to the ‘if desperate’ pile which usually just ends up getting tossed once it hits the expiry date. I wanted to love this because the reviews on the inkey have been great and the prices aren’t bad but alas, this specific product was a no for me."

I have really dry skin and no moisturizer has ever hydrated as much or as good as this one. It literally has similar effects to when I put on a  retinol at night, except it repairs your skin barrier instead!! Seriously give this a try!!!!!!

I have mature oily skin, and my face usually looks horrible (it looks as if I applied Crisco all over) with most moisturizers, but not with this one. It helps during the healing process when my face sheds. Once my skin heals and it's oily again, I use the new cream from Lancome (Renergie HPN 300 peptide cream), and the Thomas Roth (white bottle) peptide serum along with the mineral mattifying SPF from Goop. That combination makes my skin look normal, with a satin finish, so it's not shiny nor dull. It almost looks perfect, like my husband's skin lol.

I battle with having a dehydrated skin condition (different than dry skin type btw) every single winter and the past few winters it’s been harder to deal with. I finally realized with my more mature skin that the products I had been using just haven’t been enough to help hydrate and protect it, especially my moisturizer as that is supposed to be your main skin protector. I almost went for a much more expensive moisturizer, but I decided I can save myself some $$ if this ends up working really well for me and if it doesn’t I can then always try one of the more expensive brands that I’ve also been eyeing. Well I am here to tell you that I am SO glad that I made that decision and chose this face cream! Does it smell great? No of course not lol as it’s fragrance free, so I will admit I do miss the fragrance that was in my other moisturizer. That isn’t to say that it smells bad though. I think I may get some rose water or something similar to spritz on top just so I can get some fragrance on the days that I’d like some lol. I did opt for fragrance fee though as I’ll be starting retinol and I really wanted a face cream without any added ingredients that may cause some irritation to that “treatment.” Does it work well for dry skin, or dehydrated skin for that matter that can become a little sensitive or irritated due to the dehydration? The answer is heck yes it does!!! Going on it feels so smooth and creamy but not heavy. It really does help to hydrate my skin and calm it down if irritated from the elements. Hands down I would recommend to anyone who has the same skin type/condition as myself."

It works for all skin types including sensitive skin."

When I say it’s basic I don’t mean in a bad way, sometimes you just need a cream that does one function super well and I feel like that is this cream. It moisturizes and locks in that moisture without being heavy or greasy. Only reason I’m ranking it 3 instead of 4 stars is that I wish the hydrated look lasted longer… i have super dry skin and I have other creams that give me a more hydrated look for a longer period of time. I think this product would be best suited for normal/combination skin. Perhaps people with very dry skin could use in the warmer months of the year."

I was not a fan of cerave, Cetaphil or la Roche posay. I seen this pop up and the reviews were all incentivized and those that weren't were just complaining about the reviews that were. I have used this moisturizer for the past week and I really like it. My face tends to react fairly quickly to products and so far no new breakouts. It is not a super thick moisturizer nor is it a super thin one. In my opinion it is right in the sweet spot of a moisturizer that can be used day or night and will ultimately do what you need it to do: moisturize. I have very dry skin especially around my nose. I noticed that the flaking I normally experience has decreased. It soaks in really well with a thin application and doesn't disrupt my makeup. I also have put on a thicker layer at night and my face still feels moisturized in the morning! I have not noticed any type of smell. I have definitely found a replacement for the Rhode with this product and will happily repurchase when I am finished! Knocking one star only bc I hate jar packaging!"

The dryness I usually feel is really uncomfortable and this cream helped reduce that dry feel. The cream made my skin feel supple and helped improved skin elasticity. I saw that this cream really helped reduce my skin’s appearance of fine lines, which has appeared after I turned 40 . Intense cold and dry weather where I live, harms my skin barrier and makes my skin red and sensitive at spots. This cream formed a beautiful protective layer on my skin protecting and repairing my skin barrier, and thus helped reduce my redness and sensitivity. This cream texture is rich and luxurious. White in color, it is on the denser side, yet it applies and absorbs very well. It is not at all sticky."

As someone with dry and sensitive skin, I am always on the lookout for moisturizers that are hydrating, soothing, and gentle on the skin, and this moisturizer ticks all the boxes. Firstly, the formula of this moisturizer is lightweight and non-greasy, making it perfect for daily use. It absorbs quickly into the skin without leaving any residue, allowing for easy application and layering with other skincare products. Despite its lightweight texture, it provides intense hydration, leaving my skin feeling plump and moisturized throughout the day. One of the standout ingredients in this moisturizer is squalane, a natural moisturizing factor that helps to replenish and restore the skin's moisture barrier. Squalane is known for its ability to lock in moisture and improve skin elasticity, resulting in a smoother and more supple complexion. I have noticed a significant improvement in the overall hydration and texture of my skin since incorporating this moisturizer into my routine. Another great thing about this moisturizer is that it is formulated without any unnecessary additives or fragrances. It is free from parabens, sulfates, and artificial fragrances, making it suitable for those with sensitive skin or those who prefer clean and minimalistic skincare products. I appreciate that the formula is gentle and non-irritating, as it does not cause any redness or breakouts on my sensitive skin. Overall, I highly recommend Inky List's New Moisturizer to anyone looking for a lightweight yet hydrating moisturizer. Its gentle formula, effective hydration, and clean ingredients make it a standout product in the skincare market. Give it a try, and you won't be disappointed!"

I have only been using it for a few days and thus far, I think it’s a good product. That being said, if you’re looking for something exciting or innovative, you may be disappointed. It’s a basic, fragrance-free moisturizer that contains tried-and-true ingredients, such as shea butter and glycerin. Although it’s thick and creamy, it doesn’t leave me feeling greasy and it definitely does hydrate, which I appreciate. They describe this as a “ceramide-rich” moisturizer, but it only contains one ceramide (Ceramide NP), so I would have to disagree with that description. Comparatively, most CeraVe products include three. They also claim to be using “next-generation Bio-Active Ceramides,” which, according to the brand, are superior to traditional ceramides. I have never seen any other brand make this claim about the ceramides in their products, so I don’t know how true this is. Ultimately, if you’re looking for something that’s hydrating, affordable and sensitive-skin friendly, this would be a nice option. If you’re looking for something with a lot of antioxidants or active ingredients, you may want to pass on this."

			"review_text": "AMAZING moisturizer!!!! Seriously I worked at Sephora for many many years, about 7 years as a shift manager and beauty consultant,  and have tried EVERY single skincare product they have that obviously was for my skin, I don't like anything that's glowy, or made to make u look shiny or too hydrated, I like products that do the MOST and help your skin GET better but not at a high price!! which u would think everything at Sephora is expensive lol its NOT and this brand THE Inkey List IS truly incredible!! This 1 and The Ordinary is really amazing products at a lower price!!! I was in my late 20s early 30s when I worked there, I'm 34 now but DONT look like it at all AND THIS is part of the reasons why!! But also bc I have SUPER SUPER oily skin, big pores, and I USED to have Cystic Acne when I started working at Sephora, but while working there obv u get to get samples of things to try and I tried it ALL, from a 400$ serums and creams to a 5$ one lol and THE ONLY thing that worked to take my Cystic Acne away was Hyluranic acid!!! I always thought my skin didn't need moisture bc it's SOO oily, BUT it does in fact it needs more than u think!!! So instead of using all my treatments first after washing my face, I followed the Inkey Lists routine that they have on most of their bottles, and RIGHT there was where I found out I was doing it ALL wrong!!! lol smh I was applying treatments first after washing and not hydrating my skin bc I thought oh now that all the dirt and makeup is off I HAVE to put a treatment on right away so it can really get into my skin and my Cystic Acne,  NOPE WRONG!!! BIG mistake bc that was drying my skin out even more and making my Cystic Acne worse!!! So when I started using Hyluranic acid OMG it has changed my life!!! NO MORE CYSTIC ACNE!!!! That was a couple years ago and I haven't had ANY Cystic Acne since I started using Hyluranic acid right after washing my face!! THEN I go in wit the treatments and serums and moisturizers and oils!!! amazing!"

I use a very strong retinoid in my routine and it dries out my skin like crazy, but this cream has the perfect formula to counteract the dryness and make my face feel soothed, moisturized, and protected. It works wonders for us, tret users, and I bet it will be a godsend for anyone with ultra dry skin or a compromised skin barrier. A steal for $20! gifted by theinkeylist"

I noticed that my skin was very soft, smooth, and more youthful looking. That was the part that’s shook me the most, the fact that my skin looks more tight and lifted. It’s a very rich, thick texture and a little goes a long way. Definitely recommend for anyone but especially those looking to strengthen their skin barrier or for those looking for a more youthful look."
