I used 370¬∞ which is a safe temperature and it did nothing for my hair. I have a thick, slightly wavy texture and that is the standard temp I use. Even the plates were kind of sliding back and forth - side to side. What a piece of junk! Stick with reputable brands and don't waste your money on this crap."

			"review_text": "I use a straightener on a daily basis so I was super excited to try this out and it did not disappoint! It really does glide on your hair, more than any other straightener that I've tried. The shine after using is great, I didn't even add any finishing products after my first use and my hair looked so silky and shiny. I especially like to use my straightener to put curls/waves into my hair and this works great, I can slide it down my hair length in one movement without any pulling. Even though I have naturally straight hair, I do sometimes like to still run a straightener through to smooth it out or put a little flip at the ends. This one tool does all of that! The super fast heat-up is great, sometimes you need a quick touchup and don't have time to wait for the tool to fully heat up. I like that the buttons are on the inside so that I don't accidently shut it off or change the temp. And the variable temperature control means I can use this on my real hair or even to touchup wigs for cosplay events and not damage them. I'm so happy to add this to my hair toolbox, I feel like it's going to speed up my morning routine! One of the photos is after I used it for waves and the second is after I straightened the waves."
