It has a gel-like texture that goes on effortlessly, blending into the skin with no tugging or stickiness at first, but it quickly transforms into a gripping, tacky finish that’s perfect for holding makeup in place.  Longevity: I noticed that my makeup lasted way longer than usual when I used this primer. My foundation stayed put throughout the day without any noticeable fading, even after several hours. The Hydro Grip Primer definitely lives up to its claims of enhancing makeup longevity.  Hydration: My skin feels noticeably more hydrated when using this primer, which is great for my dry skin. It adds a subtle moisture boost without feeling greasy, so my skin looks fresh and dewy all day.  Overall, I’m super impressed with this primer! It really does give that fresh, long-lasting makeup look while keeping my skin hydrated. Highly recommend for anyone looking for a primer that delivers on both performance and comfort!"

Infused with hydrating ingredients like aloe vera and hyaluronic acid, it helps to lock in moisture, making it ideal for dry or combination skin types. The “grip” effect is achieved through its tacky finish, which enhances makeup adherence and longevity. This primer is also known for creating a dewy, radiant base, giving the skin a fresh, plump appearance. It’s free of silicones, vegan, and cruelty-free, appealing to those seeking clean beauty products. However, some users with oily skin may find it a bit too hydrating, potentially causing makeup to slide if not set properly. Overall, the Hydro Grip Primer is an excellent choice for those looking for a hybrid skincare-makeup product that boosts hydration and ensures long-lasting wear."

As someone with combination skin that tends to have an oily t-zone AND sweat a lot in the Texas heat, I am always looking for good primer options to help smooth and prep my skin for better and longer makeup wear. This gel-like primer has hydrating hyaluronic acid along with niacinamide that helps give the skin a dewy finish before applying your foundation. It provides almost instant hydration along with a lovely smoothing appearance once applied. I love how the lightweight gel texture and that a little product is all you need. It definitely has extended the wear time and quality of my makeup even in these last hot days of summer. I am truly pretty impressed and think this will be my go-to primer especially for the summer months. It isn't heavy on the skin and I've tried it with multiple different foundations and it worked equally as well with each one."

It’s nonscented and a little goes a long way, so you only need one pump to cover your entire face. I’ve been dealing with acne breakouts and this doesn’t aggravate or irritate my skin which is nice.

Plus, the added hyaluronic acid and aloe vera leave my skin feeling plump and soothed, which is such a bonus. One thing I’ve noticed, though, is that it doesn’t work well with oil-based foundations. The first time I tried it with one, my makeup started pilling, which was a bit frustrating. Now that I know to avoid oil-based formulas with this primer, it’s been smooth sailing, but it does limit which foundations I can use. That said, when I use it with the right foundation, the staying power is amazing! My makeup lasts all day, and I get a nice, dewy finish without feeling greasy. If you're after hydration and long-lasting wear, this primer is definitely worth it—as long as you pair it with the right products!"

The gel texture feels lightweight and absorbs quickly into my skin, leaving a hydrating base that makes my makeup last all day without melting or caking. The blue agave extract really locks in the makeup, and the combination of hyaluronic acid and hemp seed extract keeps my skin feeling moisturized. I also appreciate the addition of niacinamide and aloe water, which give my skin a fresh, dewy glow. What I love most is that it’s clean, vegan, and free of harsh ingredients like parabens, silicones, and fragrance, which makes it perfect for sensitive skin. Overall, this primer does an excellent job of gripping makeup while also nourishing the skin, making it a staple in my routine."

Second in humid SC, it will rub off more easily outdoors under the course of an hour or less. But to be fair most people aren't going to wear makeup to an outdoor event like a petting zoo.

The Hydro Grip Hydrating Makeup Primer by Milk Makeup is a standout product in the realm of makeup primers, offering impressive hydration and staying power. Its unique, gel-based formula is infused with a blend of hydrating ingredients such as aloe water, hyaluronic acid, and cactus extract, which work together to provide a smooth, dewy base for makeup application. The primer's grip technology creates a tacky layer on the skin, ensuring that foundation and other products adhere more effectively and last longer throughout the day. One of the primer's key benefits is its versatility; it works well for various skin types, including dry and combination skin. The lightweight texture absorbs quickly without feeling greasy, making it ideal for those who want a hydrating boost without compromising on a matte finish. Users also appreciate the primer's ability to minimize the appearance of pores and fine lines, providing a flawless canvas for makeup. However, some users might find the initial tacky feeling slightly unusual, though it usually fades as the primer sets. Overall, the Hydro Grip Hydrating Makeup Primer is a reliable choice for anyone seeking to enhance makeup longevity while maintaining a hydrated, fresh look."

This groundbreaking, award winning, silicone-free primer not only smooths skin but it also gives makeup an ultra grip that keeps it locked for up to 12 hours. And what’s more is that it also locks in hydration to keep skin looking absolutely fabulous!! Plus, it contains some of the best ingredients like the widely popular niacinamide and hyaluronic acid for moisturizing and hydration, hemp-derived cannabis seed extract to visibly smooth skin and blue agave extract to help form an invisible layer to help grip and lock in makeup. This has been my go-to primer every single day and I cannot begin to explain just how much I love it!! My makeup looks better than ever and I don’t have to worry about reapplying anything. One of the best- if not THE best- primers out there!!"

I thought this at first pump was very gel like and sticky. I used a couple of pumps at first and it seemed to rub pretty smoothly just felt tacky but that’s what you want in a grip primer so your makeup will stick to it and hold and also depending on how long you wait to start your makeup the tacky does absorb pretty well and becomes more of a smooth and hydrated base. I did prep my skin before this also. I thought my makeup went on pretty smooth with no issues but did look kind of cakey in certain spots especially if I put powder on it. I wouldn’t use powder makeup with this because it can peel which was strange but I also tested that out on my hand. I thought that overall my skin and makeup looked fine but maybe just a little bit rough in spots but by the end of the day it still held up pretty well and I tested this out when I went to a fair on a hot day and decided to do my makeup so was sweating. It definitely looked rough which was expected but also held better than I expected so I give it credit that I feel it did decent. I overall feel it works better with than without if you prep correctly with it."

The primer sinks into the skin almost instantly, creating a smooth and even surface. It's lightweight and doesn't leave any greasy or sticky residue.   One of the most impressive qualities of the Hydro Grip Primer is its ability to extend the wear time of your makeup. I noticed a significant difference when using this primer; my foundation and concealer stayed put all day long, even through sweat and humidity.   As the name suggests, the Hydro Grip Primer is extremely hydrating. It contains a blend of hyaluronic acid, glycerin, and aloe vera that leaves the skin feeling supple and refreshed. I found that it helped to minimize the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles, giving my skin a more youthful glow.  The Hydro Grip Primer works well with a variety of base products. I tried it with both liquid and powder foundations, and it performed equally well with both. It didn't alter the coverage or finish of my foundation and allowed it to blend seamlessly into my skin.  The Milk Makeup Hydro Grip Hydrating Makeup Primer is an absolute must-have for anyone who wants a smooth, hydrated, and long-lasting makeup base. Its innovative formula glides on effortlessly, creates an even canvas, and keeps your makeup looking fresh all day long.

It's especially appreciated by those with dry or combination skin types for its moisturizing and long-wearing properties. However, individuals with very oily skin might find it a bit too hydrating."

This primer made the rest of my makeup separate all over my face, and I looked splotchy & awful. This is the only new product that I was using; I was already using the rest of my makeup & skin care products before I tried this primer.  I started seeing videos on social media saying to use water-based primers, like this one, with other water-based makeup. Well, the primer I used before this Milk one is also water-based (according to the internet), and the rest of my makeup never separated like it does with this Milk one. I do not have the money & interest to waste in changing the rest of my makeup to find products that will play nicely with this primer.   I followed the instructions in letting the primer set for 60 seconds. I applied with my fingers. It feels slightly tacky/sticky when applied, but I didn't mind since it dries. Sometimes it would pill. For being called Hydro-grip, I don't feel that it did better at gripping or holding my make up in place or helping it last longer than other primers. It made my make up worse.  Sadly, it was past Sephora's return window when I finally gave up, so I wasted money & have 3/4 of a bottle left. I regret buying the full size vs. the mini, but I didn't think it would be this bad because it was highly rated."

I didn’t change anything else about my routine and my face makeup did not budge every day I wore this makeup, including days that had 80% humidity and temperatures in the 80s. I’m so impressed and shocked at how well this worked."

One standout ingredient in this primer is blue agave extract, something I've never tried before. It's amazing how it locks in moisture and gives my skin that extra boost of hydration. Plus, it’s packed with hyaluronic acid, a favorite of mine for its skin-plumping and hydrating properties. What I appreciate most is how this primer blends skincare and makeup seamlessly. It’s like having a built-in skincare routine within my makeup application. The lightweight gel texture feels cool and refreshing, and it grips my foundation perfectly without feeling sticky. If you’re into functional makeup products that also take care of your skin, the Hydro Grip Primer is right up your alley. It’s a must-have for keeping your makeup looking fresh and flawless, even on the hottest days."

Overall, I'm thrilled with the Hydro Grip Primer and will continue to use it as part of my daily routine."

I've tried countless options, from silicone-based blurring primers to hydrating serums, but none have quite delivered the results I was looking for - until I discovered Milk Makeup's Hydrogrip Hydrating Makeup Primer.  From the moment I first applied this primer, I could feel the difference. The gel-like formula glides onto the skin effortlessly, providing an instant surge of hydration that leaves my complexion plump and dewy. Unlike some primers that can feel heavy or create a tacky base, the Hydrogrip primer has a lightweight, almost undetectable texture that allows my foundation to apply seamlessly on top.  One of the standout features of this primer is its ability to grip and hold onto my makeup. I've noticed a significant improvement in the longevity of my foundation and concealer when I use the Hydrogrip primer, with my makeup looking fresh and radiant well into the later hours of the day. This is a game-changer for me, as my dry skin often causes my base products to break down and emphasize flakiness by midday.  Beyond its functional benefits, I've also grown to love the soothing, calming effect the Hydrogrip primer has on my skin. The formula is infused with nourishing ingredients like cactus flower, which helps to hydrate and plump the skin, and green tea, which provides antioxidant protection. I find that my complexion feels instantly soothed and refreshed after application, with no irritation or unwanted shine.  As someone who previously struggled to find a primer that could combat my dry skin without compromising the longevity or appearance of my makeup, Milk Makeup's Hydrogrip Hydrating Primer has become an essential part of my daily routine. It greatly transformed the way my foundation applies!"

This has a lightweight, gel-like consistency with a slightly tacky feeling. I could feel this primer slightly after applying, but the feeling goes away after a few minutes. I applied my skin care as normal, essence, serum, moisturizer and sunscreen and added this as the last step before my makeup routine. This gave my skin a slight luminosity, but did not make my skin look oily. I did a full face of makeup and it lasted through a night out at dinner and a concert, about eight hours. I did have one smudged area where I had scratched my face, but where I did not touch, my makeup looked the same as when I applied it. I even tried a tissue test to see how much my makeup transferred, and it was minimal with this primer. My makeup applied smoothly over this and I noticed no pilling when I used brushes and my fingers to blend my makeup. The application looked great and I found this to be a nice base to work off of. I really enjoy the design of this packaging, as the product was easy to dispense the amount needed and the pump helps to keep things sanitary. Plus, this looks great on a vanity. I would recommend this primer and I think I may have to pick up the matching setting spray to finish my makeup looks with."

I've experimented with cheaper alternatives, but none compare to the results I get with this primer, so I'm willing to invest in it until I find a suitable alternative.

			"review_text": "I got this primer to try because I loved the fact that it was clear in color. Unfortunately, I will not be buying this product again. The first thing off the bat is how expensive the product is. For someone who doesn't use makeup much, the size is perfect, but for 20 USD, I could probably find a clear one for cheaper at the local store. The other thing I learned after receiving the product is all the harsh chemicals that are in this product which makes it unsuitable for everyday wear. And before people come at me for this one, I am aware most makeup products do include questionable ingredients, for some it's great, but for others not so much. Like most products, this primer has phenoxyethenol which is an endocrine disrupter making it not the safest product to use especially for younger aged girls. Furthermore, there were several ingredients in this product that are considered irritants. I usually do not pay attention to chemicals being labelled irritants as anything can irritate the skin based on the individual's skin; however, I learned with this product that it did indeed irritate my skin. With the first dab of the product, I could feel my face burning from the product. There are other chemicals I could rant about, but I think I mentioned the main one that's good to avoid. I think this was a really neat product to try and the packaging is cute, but it will most likely be a one time purchase for me."

			"review_text": "I was initially drawn to the Milk Makeup primer due to its positive reviews, stylish packaging, and the appeal of a natural product. However, my excitement quickly turned into disappointment after using it consistently.  Pros:  Attractive packaging: The bottle design is sleek and visually appealing. Natural ingredients: I appreciated the commitment to natural ingredients, which initially influenced my decision to purchase. Cons:  Pilling issues: The major drawback I encountered was the primer causing pilling with whichever foundation I used. This issue persisted, and it became evident that the primer was the culprit. Review: Despite the positive aspects, the pilling problem significantly overshadowed any benefits the primer offered. It was disheartening to invest in a large bottle only to find that it negatively impacted the application of my foundation. I tried various foundations, but the issue persisted consistently.  I had high expectations given the brand's reputation, but unfortunately, the primer did not live up to its promises. If you are considering this primer, be cautious about its compatibility with different foundations.  In conclusion, while the Milk Makeup primer may work well for some, my personal experience with pilling has left me hesitant to recommend it. It's essential to consider your specific foundation and skin type before investing in this product."

For the most part, I was able to see that impact loud & clear, but transparently noticed a couple of pitfalls. While my skin initially felt much more hydrated and the primer served as a great base, my skin sensitivity and eczema quickly caught up with me after just a couple of uses. Unfortunately the product triggered some dry, red and flakey skin and caused a bit of irritation. For this reason, I would triple check the ingredient list and ensure it lines up with your routine and skin concerns. I'd say this product aligns better with oily/combo skin vs. dry/sensitive, so just know where you land on the spectrum and the potential impacts."
