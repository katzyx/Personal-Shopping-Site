There is very minimal tingling, so if the tingling / burning sensation of other plumping glosses bothers you, you’d probably like this one just fine, but I personally like to feel it “working” a bit more.  Top photo is before application, middle is immediately after I put it on, and bottom pic is about 15 minutes after applying the gloss. There’s some plumping, but very minimal. On the fence if I’ll return to try something else or keep because it’s still a nice gloss. If you’re looking for something that’s really going to make your lips pop, this isn’t it, but if you’re just looking for a moisturizing gloss with a pretty sheen, you’ll love this one."

The plumping though is truly AMAZING!! I know products don’t work for every person, but wow oh wow, I cannot say enough good about this one. I’ve gone through 3 bottles and just tried the golden shimmer version too. I like to put it on at night also cuz I wake up with plumper, softer lips.

			"review_text": "So, I enjoy viewing products I LOVE and address the 1 Star reviews. I purchased this from Buxom Cosmetics' original site and have been wearing it ever since it arrived. I can say that if you don't feel the tingling sensation, your lips have to be numb. To me, the tingling sensation feels like my lips are itching so it made me look in the mirror and that's when I noticed it... my lips were so plump and juicy! As long as I wasn't having an allergic reaction, the tingle does not bother me.  As far as the texture, this is definitely not sticky. This is coming from a woman who LOVES sticky lip gloss and this isn't it. But this is probably the only non-sticky lip product that I actually love. It's smooth. it allows your lips to breathe and have time apart from each other when you talk. I applied this on my lips when they were dry and cracked and this lip gloss instantly smoothed and hydrated my lips.  The last thing I want to address is the application. Someone gave it 1 star and said that it gave them some kind of irritation around their lips... Sweetie, the directions specifically say to be sure to apply it only on the inside of the living of your lips. Don't go near the outside. Don't rate something 1 star if you cannot properly read the packaging and use it the way it's intended to be used.  I do favor the original plumping polish and creams, but this lip product is like a new race or ethnicity coming to America. You gotta give it a chance for what it actually is (based on its claims) and not for what you want it to be. This lip product is not claiming to be a Buxom Cosmetics Plumping Polish or Plumping Cream. It is PLUMP SHOT. A collagen-infused SERUM. Technically, it's not a gloss. It's a lip treatment. And this is the best lip treatment I have ever tried."

Someone mentioned an old lip product I loved in the questions section and I agree that this is similar in effect and feel. Feel is nice- just heavy enough w out being too thick. It also has a slight plumping and smoothing effect, enough to be noticeable but w out the extreme effects of some other brands that plump while turning the edges of your lips a weird inflamed red. I use it before bed and in the morning and have noticed my lips looking healthier altogether. Perfect as we start moving out of masks in my state."

I have used Buxom's lipgloss in dolly and I feel that the gloss has more of a plumping effect. I didn't really see a huge difference, I already have nice lips but I wanted a little mmph, and this didn't give me that. Compared to too faced, this doesn't really plump.   Compared to Too Faced plumping gloss, this has 1/3 of the tingling stingy sensation. If you find Too Faced plumping products too intense, the Buxom plump shot may be better for those who are sensitive.   The consistency is between a balm to a gloss, it is less sticky and shiny than a gloss. It is very similar to Selena Gomez's rare beauty lip glosses. You can definitely use this under other lip products, but if you do that just use one coat (you don't want to have product build up). If you want to wear this alone, I like to apply twice on my upper and bottom lips.   I can say this did keep my lips hydrated and soft. I apply it at night and wake up with soft lips.   Now on the packaging, the applicator is decent. I can't tell how much product is in the container, the bottle is very thick, so I feel like for the price, there should be more product."

I wouldn't say it's a gloss because it feels like the serums I use on my face. It's also not sticky at all! It coats the lips very nicely, and I can see my lips plump up, lines smoothed and turn a nice cherry red. It does have a tingle, but it is not uncomfortable, and the scent is very nice; it reminds me of Christmas time peppermint. I would say this plumper works! Compared to the too-faced plumper, I lost my interest in it, and this buxom one beats it hands down!

			"review_text": "It has a very nice texture, not sticky at all, kinda like an oil but a little thicker, glides very smoothly. The applicator is a little hard and doesn’t pick up a lot of product. The tingling is bearable, nothing terrible. It DOES plump, I’d say for me, even better than Dior. Be careful with the application because if you get it on the outer part of your lips it will burn a little an change the color of the skin like a burn. I really liked it and think I will keep it as a treatment since it feels hydrating as well."

BE CAREFUL because I accidentally applied it on the upper lip area between the nose and it swelled up weird and it was an annoying feeling that looked like a red spot."
