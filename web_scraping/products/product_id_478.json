Itâ€™s not too thick, it doesnâ€™t leave a weird residue after a bit and it is SO soft! And the honey vanilla sent smells just like a maple bar itâ€™s delish soft."

			"review_text": "I consider myself to be pretty obsessed with lip products.  I thought after I went through my 5th or 6th vanilla Laneige, I thought I could safely say it was my favorite.  My only hesitation with Farmacy is the honey flavors/fragrance of the products, just cause honey isn't my favorite smell.  But, the flavors of the Lip Smoothies I've tried here--Pear Kiwi and Apple--they are the most pleasant smelling/tasting lip products I've ever tried.  They are so clean smelling, and there isn't unneeded sweetener added, I believe.  Let me also say that there is zero taste of lip balm' in this product--that is something that drives me crazy.  Fenty Skin Plush Puddin' has a faint taste of lip balm that is unpleasant to me.  If you love the thick, dense feeling of that Plush Puddin', by the way, you'll find this product to be the opposite of that.  I enjoy both products, but Lip Smoothie is much more of a pleasant experience.    Now, the formula is VERY soft and 'melting'.  It almost feels like oil on the lips, but not greasy or slimy.  It's a much more thin formula than I was expecting, and I was unsure about it at first.  But, after a couple weeks of use, I knew it was the best formula I had in the house - out of too many to count.  I felt like I was applying Laneige all day just out of habit, but I don't need to reach for the Lip Smoothie nearly as much.    I say if you've been on the fence about this one, just consider the one point I've made:  what this product does while on the lips is very impressive--so the wear time isn't the only thing to consider.  A thinner product may not seem to last quite as long lasting as other lip butters you've used, BUT...my lips are so hydrated after using this, I don't need to constantly reach for others.    The packaging is glass and pretty heavy. also much nicer than tubes or plastic.  This product deservers more attention."

Farmacy is one of my favorite brands, all of their products smell amazing, especially their lip balms, and they work so so well. Lots of lip balms that I have tried, like Laneige, have not worked for me, so when I tried this I was surprised by how well this worked on my lips. Itâ€™s such a smooth, buttery lip balm, itâ€™s so soothing."
