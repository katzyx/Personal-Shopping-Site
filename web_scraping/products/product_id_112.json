This one just says Laughter is the best cosmetic. I guess the joke's on me because the cost isn't mini. I will continue to use as it's the only blush that doesn't inundate with pigment."

			"review_text": "The Good: This blush has been around for a while, to the point where I remember buying my first one of these probably over a decade ago now a young teen girl entering the makeup world. This product has one of those nostalgia factors for me. I stopped using this blush for a while and moved on to other things but recently I got a mini of this and I was reminded all over again why I used to swear by this blush back in the day. This is a fantastic and gorgeous blush for fair skin girls. It has buildable coverage and looking so natural on the cheeks. If you're going for a no makeup makeup look, this is for sure your blush. If you're looking for a beautiful blush to wear on a first date, this is your blush. If you want something subtle but naturally stunning for the office, this is the blush. I will definitely be rebuying the full size once I get done with the mini I currently own.   The Bad: This blush formula is excellent but it only comes in this one color on a consistent basis. Therefore, although this works for me I doubt that it would really do much for darker skin tones, which is a shame. This brand should definitely make a darker version of this to be more inclusive. Also, the packaging is paper and it stains easily, it's also clunky and takes up a lot of room unnecessarily. No blush should ever take up more room than loose powder.  The Ugly/Honest: The brush it comes with is unusable and that money should have gone into creative a more travel-friendly and durable packaging for this product. The lack of shade variety is honestly puzzling for such a staple product that has been around for such a long time. Packaging needs a revamp into this decade, desperately."

I already purchased a new box for when this one finally runs out. This  product was the #1 reason that my wedding day makeup was a huge win.  This blush is NOT too dark for my snow-white skin...it brightens up my whole face without looking bronzer-y. Although there is a tiny amount of shimmer, it does NOT make my face look like an oil slick (like highlighting powder often does). It's a very subtle and tasteful shimmer. Most people probably wouldn't even notice the shimmer, I don't think.  Dandelion has become like a setting powder for me due to my paleness. I apply this all over lightly, THEN apply a blush in a little bit darker shade on my cheeks.   I absolutely love it.  If you are pale like me, I think you'll love this as much as I do. :)"

The only problem is the price as it is a little steep but it is definitely worth it especially because it doesn't contribute to any excess oil on my face and would not harm any skin type. I have medium skin that is usually a bit paler without a suntan (but when living in Los Angeles you can basically get a suntan anytime of the year).

If you are someone who never uses blush, this is the blush for you!  This is literally a hybrid between a powder and a blush, almost a non-blush blush, if that makes sense. The color is very buildable and is the most soft, natural looking color of pink I‚Äôve ever seen. I have light olive skin and prefer a very natural makeup look, and in the summertime I can use this all over my face similar to a setting powder. I can use it all year round as a very natural looking blush that instantly perks up a dull or tired looking complexion.  I do understand that for people with darker complexions and women of color, this blush might just not show up on them. It‚Äôs always worth testing in the department store if you can; even if you don‚Äôt like it as a blush you might consider it as a brightening setting powder."

My daily makeup consists of a natural face w/ light contouring, a simple cat eye with some white shimmer/sparkle in the center of my top and bottom lid as well as the tearduct highlight area. Since I use a shimmer on my eyes I don't like using a blush that is also shimmery. I received the NARS orgasm as a gift but I rarely use it because it is so shimmery. After talking to my sister about this she let me try her Benefit Dandelion Box o' Powder Blush and I fell in LOVE!! Not only does it have a beautiful, light fragrance but it also has a beautiful colour. It's sheer enough to look very natural but you can also build up the colour with more layers. The only downside to this blush is the containers design and the brush it comes with (hence, the four stars). I'm not sure which size I have but it is quite small which makes it a little inconvenient to use a kabuki brush which is what I use for blush. The brush that it comes with fits perfectly in the little box, however, it feels a little rough and I don't like the coverage it applies; it doesn't do a good job blending up and out. Overall, I highly recommend this blush although I would recommend to buy the larger container so that you can use the brush of your choice to apply it. It has such a lovely smell as well and as someone who tends to break out easily it hasn't irritated my skin at all. LOVE THIS PRODUCT!"

When I first tried it on at home I fell in love with this adorable blush! It smells great and adds a perfect touch of pink to my cheeks. There is little to no fallout and is housed in a sturdy cardboard case. The travel size brush is soft with some firm bristles that pick up the powder perfectly and fits into the box, but my favorite thing about the brush is the size.

It is the most flattering blush I've ever used. I like it even better than Nars orgasm. If you just need an everyday blush for a no-make up fresh look. This is it. If i'm going out, or need a more dramatic look, I'll use it as a highlighter and just brush a little bit as a finish over the darker color. They say radiant and brightening. It's true. I think it's flattering because, even though it's a pale pink, it's not whitish, or ashy. It does't lighten, it just adds a dose of petal pink and maybe just a hint of gold shimmer.   I just saw that they have a liquid, too. I think I may get that to layer underneath. It looks like people have recommended it in the reviews.   Also, people with darker skin shouldn't be afraid to try this blush. It truly seems to work with all skin tones. When I'm in the sun, I get dark fast. It's just as flattering. Thinking about it? Give it a try. It's so pretty."

It is quite small, but of course it is the travel size. I read many many many reviews saying it was way too light. That is not true. Yes, it is not as pigmented as many blushes, but it definitely shows on my skin. It really brightens my face without making me look like a clown or too overdone. The brush with it works fine, but I prefer using my go to blush brush. This is the perfect everyday blush. Perfect for school, or those who don't have the money to purchase multiple blushes. It's great for youths who want to enhance their natural beauty. This is a pretty neutral color and I think would look great on anybody. Again, this is a NATURAL BLUSH. On darker skins, it could be used as a highlighter, but I don't recommend it. If you want to use it as a highlighter, it's way better to buy an actual highlighter. There is a slight shimmer in it, All in all, this is a great go-to blush, perfect for any natural look."

I have really fair skin in the winter and it's the perfect natural pink that gives you a pinky, rosy glow without being overpowering. It also smells heavenly which is always a plus! I also like that it wears well throughout the day; it probably isn't as long-lasting as something like the Tarte amazonian clay 12 hour blush buuuut it still holds up nicely over the course of wear.

I have a feeling this is one of those products that works better for people who have paler skin year-round. The formula was lovely, but I wish it was more versatile for my skin tone. I found that because my skin tone changes quite a bit the Dallas powder from benefit suits my skin tone much better than this one, and it's much more versatile!"

As a highligher, it's also too subtle as i prefer them with more shimmer, and i didn't spend money on this to just use it for an all over powder. I would've been happier if it brightened up my face as an all over but i didn't notice any changes.  I love benefit but this was a fail for me.

I also use the posie tint on my lips for a lip stain then after it dries I use the dandelion plush lip gloss over the posie tint. After I am done I have this angel pink glow look that I LOVE!

The only reason I did not give this product 5 stars is because it can look a bit ashy if you over apply. If you go too sheer, it may also disappear on your skin. Overall, I love dandelion, it gives me a beautiful rosy glow and I love that it's not over the top shimmery. If you are light to medium complected I strongly recommend this!"

			"review_text": "I love Dandelion! I have used this blush for years and I have nothing but good things to say about it. Well, mostly good things to say. The one tiny, little, itsy bitsy thing that bothers me is the staying power of this blush, but I will get into that later.  So, what is it? It's a beautiful pink shimmer that I have found to be flattering on MOST skin types. Sadly, since this is a fairly sheer blush, I would imagine that it might not show up that well on darker skin tones, but I do not know that for a fact. What I do know is that this works well on my friend who is VERY VERY pale, and on me. My skin is on the lighter side of medium/lighter olive-ish (I am mixed, so exact skin tone is a tricky subject). It gives you a dewy look with a SUBTLE shimmer, so don't be expecting anything crazy.  I like the little brush that comes with it. While I loooove my Bobbi Brown brush set and my Real Techniques brush set, I am not so much of a snob that I would thumb my nose at the tool that is included. I tend to use my other brushes, but this one is perfectly usable, and definitely functional.  And the smell! As anyone that has read my other reviews knows, smells are are a BIG deal to me. This smells lightly floral. It is very pleasant and it fades quickly, but it is nice while it is around. Not enough to irritate my allergies or my sensitive skin, so that is a big plus.  The only con? The staying power. I have not had the best luck with getting blushes to stay on my face for extended periods of time, and this blush is no exception. I do have to reapply after a few hours (assuming I am not being lazy), but I normally do, so it is not an issue for me. Just don't put this blush on at 5am, and expect to still see it when you get home at 7pm."

			"review_text": "Since I am extremely fair, I am using this more as a blush than a highlighter, but can see how it works as both. It is a very soft, pale ballerina pink with subtle shimmer. It is not heavily pigmented, so it takes a couple of sweeps across my cheeks to give me a soft pink flush. I also use it around my temples, nose, and chin to create a nice glow. On the skin, this leaves just a whisper of baby pink with a slightly luminous finish. You can layer it for more color, but it is always going to be light. It can start leaning a little chalky with a heavy application, so be sure to blend. The formula is a finely-milled powder, but it does not fly everywhere with a swirl of the brush. It does have a flowery scent, but that does not transfer to your skin. I am very sensitive to fragrances and this does not bother me at all. I'm not the biggest fan of the cardboard box as it does not seem luxurious and is a little awkward to open. It is also kind of bulky and takes up more room than I'd like in my cosmetics case. But, you do get lots of product for the money. If you are fair and looking for just a hint of pink, this is a great blush and highlighter. For those with a darker complexion, this is probably a highlighter/brightener only. I am really enjoying this for a sweet and natural look. I love this paired with Dior Addict Urban lipstick which is a sheer, pale pink lipstick with soft shimmer. They look like they were made for each other."

I sweep on my cheekbones, over my bronzer, and I look really beautiful. This stuff gives me a subtle glow that u can wear day or night. The faint, pale pink makes me look healthy and happy! Also, because it is a lighter color, it atually helps my sunken cheeks look fuller and more youthful! One suggestion: toss the brush it comes w aside. You really wont get a decent application with it. I use a bigger, fluffier powder brush. I swirl it around in the box, blow a bit of the excess off, and then swirl on my cheeks! Presto chango!

The brush picks up just the right amount of product and applies a nice, even dusting to my cheeks.

Great for summer. These Benefit Boxes always last me months. It takes a long time to hit pan on these blushes/bronzers. So They are worth the price.

It gives you that perfect baby doll cheek look. Very natural, everytime I wear it my friends ask me what I'm wearing because I look polished. I wear this alone (feels so light and almost creamy) and sometimes with Nars Blush in Deep Throat to add a little oomph. The scent smells like roses which I love but might turn someone off. While the packaging is odd it is very effective. With the fine powder blush you always get some sort of scraps left over when you use a brush and you end up losing product. The box packaging keeps the fall out inside so you don't lose the powder, ingenious! I find the brush it comes with is pretty much useless but I don't know many people who actually use the application tools that come with makeup. I've been using it for almost 7 months consistently almost everyday and I have yet to put a serious dent in it and I really put it on. I like applying it twice because it really makes you cheeks look gorgeous. However I am fair skinned and I don't know how this would work on darker complexions. If you have a darker complexion I would definitely hit up your local Sephora and play around with it. I highly recommend it, the price is justified by how well it works, great functional packaging and the lasting power of it not only on your face but also in how long the product will last you in the long run."

Since embracing my pale roots I have made the transition from bronzer to blush as bronzers now looks very unnatural and muddy on my skin.  It has been hard for me to find flattering blushes. I've had a lot of misses with my purchases. For example, the renowned nars orgasm looks way too pink and unnatural on me. A lot of other blushes are either too intense, or chalky...  Benefit dandelion is by far the most flattering colour for me! It's amazing actually. Its very hard to use too much unlike my nars sin which I am actually scared to use because it ends up looking too much more times than not.

The pretty light pink color is perfect for fair skin.  The color is a light pink with a medium amount of fine silver shimmer. For those looking for a matte blush or looking to avoid shimmer altogether, I wouldn‚Äôt recommend this. However, the shimmer is very fine and not very noticeable once applied. The blush is compacted in the box but picks up on the enclosed brush very easily. The brushed included with the Benefit brushes are my favorite blush brushes that I‚Äôve ever tried- they create a perfect glow on the cheek. The powder goes on smoothly, lasts all day long, and does not irritate my skin. Even when I notice my foundation or setting powder looking a little dull after a long day, this blush is still going strong."

I've tried it as my blush but now I think I'm going to switch to using it as my all-over face highlighter. The only downside I would say is the fact that if you layer a little more on your cheeks for a pop of color, I feel it starts to look powdery. I even wiped some of it off and used a clean brush to buff the rest into my skin, in an effort to combat the powdery effect, but it didn't work that well. I can see the product clinging to my peach fuzz and that is a no-no for me. I use Bobbi Brown blush in Apricot daily, and I like it better because it's pressed very hard so it doesn't get powdery, no matter how much you apply. I'm still going to use this product, I do like it. However; I am a little dissapointed with the way it applies because the color it gives is so pretty!

And by little, I mean LITTLE. I'm scared that one day I'll just dry the whole thing out within 2 weeks of purchasing it.  But, it does boost my self-confidence, and it DID give my face a luminous glow while also adding a nice flush of color. I have medium, fair/tan skin, and it goes very well. Though, for a cheaper alternative ($28 is a LITTLE much for this sort of thing) I would just use light blush."

It's nothing against Benefit, I'm just one of those people who finds a brand I like for something and I stick to it (i.e. lipsticks all come from Buxom, eyeshadows from Urban Decay and Kat von D, etc). Then I decided to get the Benefit little looks 500 pt perk in store a week or so ago. It had a mini badgal mascara, a mini that gal and a full sized dandelion.  I had actually been considering looking for a lighter, pinker blush. I typically use Nars Lovejoy on the recommendation of one of the girls at my local store but as I got more color into the summer it wasn't standing out much on my skin. I wanted something light but that would stand out. Dandelion, my accidental find, did just that. I have a light-to-medium skin tone and it really does run that gamut depending on the time of year and the amount of sunlight I've been seeing.  Dandelion is a very subtle, pretty pink when I use it as a blush. It stands out just enough for me to notice it but not enough for it to draw attention to itself. It both brightens my face up and adds that hint of color that makes me look happier. I may very well be in love."

			"review_text": "I purchased this product after I read that Isla Fischer (the redhead from Wedding Crashers) uses it as a blush. I have a skin tone that is not quite as light as hers, but still pretty fair. Unfortunately for me, this shade is a little too close to the color of my skin. Since the product is so sheer, that means I have to apply a ton to make it look like a blush. For the longest time, I thought the product wouldn't work for me since I was only using the brush it came with. Recently, I've discovered that using a very dense, tiny kabuki brush gives me enough product for it to show up as a blush. As a blush it has a nice luminescence, since it's just shimmery enough (never glittery). Conversely, if I use an enormous powder brush, it is sheer enough that I can use it as an all-over highlighter. I love the brush itself, both the design and the quality, but I simply can't get it to work with this product on me. Unfortunately, that means that it isn't as portable for my purposes (I have to bring along an extra brush). I do love the feel of the brush, so I'll probably start using it with a light bronzer.  Overall, I think the boxed powder collection idea is great. The products are incredibly portable, the quality is excellent, and the smell is lovely. Also, even with daily use, they will last you forever. I'm just not 100% sure about this color. My mom uses the Coralista blush, and whenever I've borrowed it from her, I've been very impressed. In retrospect, rather than choosing a product that works as both a blush and a luminizer, I wish I'd gotten one of each. While this product serves both purposes, I don't feel that it does either exceptionally well. Instead, I'd call it a decent blush and a decent luminizer (in my case, only when I'm not using the brush that it came with). Of course, everyone's skin is different, so I'm sure there are women who look phenomenal in this. Even if you don't love it this color, I would definitely recommend looking into the boxed powder collection."

A single stroke of the excellent brush that comes with the powder gives my skin a beautiful look. Since it highlights, it detracts from and disguises any skin imperfections. And for those of us over 30, it takes back time. I can't say for sure if it's the pure innocent pink color, or perhaps something more difficult to define, but even when I apply it ever so lightly on my pale skin, my skin looks younger and radiant.  Sometimes I use Dandelion over Benefit's That Gal primer and sometimes I use it alone. Either way, I'm very happy with the results. My skin looks fresh and young. It's wonderful that such transformations can come from a box of powder.  Dandelion is one of the best powders available. It works well with my pale complexion, and can be layered for even more depth. I also like to layer it over a pale bronze primer in summer, so that I end up with a little bit of natural color. Dandelion can be the beginning of so many styles. I've used Dandelion now for about three years. I know I can depend on it to make me look great no matter what the season or event."

It gives me a rosy glow that doesn't look overdone and the shimmer is barely noticeable. I can wear this blush with any makeup look and it works so I am happy its such a versatile product.  My own gripe is the box, its adorable but I would have preferred an old fashioned pan like regular blushes come in as that would make it easier to get the product. I also tossed the brush as I find a bigger fluffier brush that I got from Quo works way better and is more functional."

I'm not a fan of modern coral-colored blushes because I have a more classic style and I prefer a more pinkish hue. The ballerina pink color of Dandelion is ideal. These boxed powders by Benefit are top quality, smell great, and since you get a lot of product, they're totally worth the expensive price. I know I'll be able to use this blush for years. The only thing I don't like about it is the brush it comes with. In my opinion, the brush it comes with is too wide for the precision application I like, so I use my Bare Escentuals blush brush instead."

This looks great combined with bronzer all dolled up or is great to throw on in the early mornings with no other makeup just to look refreshed. The little box is easy to throw in a purse or clutch, especially because it comes with a brush. The only thing I dont like about the box-shaped holder is that once you get down to the end there is only stuff left in the corners. Here's the easy fix - take a Q-tip and just break it off so it's in loose pieces and that little bit will last you for another week or two."

My skin is a light yet golden color if that makes sense so I couldn't really see it. I love the bubblegum pink color but too bad I couldn't see it.

I'm NC30 (medium-light complexion with golden undertones) and this product just came into the mail today.  ------------------ Physicals: The brush is a little harsh for me, however I am used to the too faced Kabuki brush which is very soft. However I feel that the shape of the brush works with the box and applying the product on my cheek.  The box is smaller than I thought it would be. It's about a cube an inch and a half around. The blush is deepset into the box, so I feel as though using it is somewhat awkward.  The powder is extremely soft. Softer than all the blushes I've ever purchased. ------------------ Usage:  Really pretty color! It brightens my face up! From far away, it looks like a light LUMINZER, and makes me look very awake. However if you peer into the mirror up close, the blush does not blend in with your skin, and you can tell there is a powdery material sitting on your cheeks. This is not noticible from 2 feet away.  I put it on approximentally 3 hours ago... and even ontop of foundation it no longer looks like I have it on. You can tell SOMETHING is there, however it is very faint. You will need to reapply after 3hours. For the record I have combination skin."

Normally, I wear Cover FX's Golden Peach as a blush during the summer as my face gets darker and Tarte's Flushed during the winter as I'm very fair-skinned when not in the sun. However, I just wanted something different and more illuminating for the coming cooler weather this year. Benefit Cosmetics has been a hit or miss with me. I LOVE Erase Paste as a concealer and I love the creme eyeshadows, but I've had some other meh moments with other Benefit products. Sooooooo...last night I ventured over to the Benefit products because I had heard some good things about Dandelion powder. (My daughter LOVES Georgia Peach). I tried both the Coralista, which was way to orange on me, and the Dandelion. Dandelion gave me such a pretty pink and natural flush and the illumination was extremely subtle so I purchased it on the spot. This morning I used it over my CoverFX Creme Foundation in C20 and am SUCH a happy camper. Where has this blush (even though they call it a powder) been all my life? This color is a keeper! No clown cheeks. Not too much color. It is just absolutely perfect! I'll tell you when Benefit gets it right, they get it right! I hope this is never discontinued! If you have fair skin with cool undertones, this is a beautiful blush. It does look darker in the box, but once you apply it--it just makes this lovely transformation. Oh..BTW, I used a large blush brush to apply. The brush it comes with may be cute, but it is totally useless. Benefit should just charge three dollars less for this product and d.q. the brush. Just my opinion!"

It's also fairly expensive, but based on how long it has lasted, it's worth the price. (I never used the brush, so I can't comment about that)"

I think this product is better for someone with lighter/fair skin tones... and I'm more of a medium. So, for $28 dollars, I decided to return it since it didn't do much for me.

This brings some life back into my face. For me, after the intial steps of foundation (if i decide to go with foundation that day), and then blush, leaves my face still somewhat lifeless. A sweep of Dandelion makes me appear more lively.  I've been complimented that I often look so glowy. (Excuse the lack of a better word, but that's a compliment straight from the mouth of a boy!)

Every single age group will benefit from this powder. It's a pink pressed highlighting powder that gives skin a brand new innocent look with the stroke of the brush. Because it's a highlighting powder, it also detracts from any skin imperfections. But more than that, for those of us over 30, it takes back time. I'm not sure if it's the pure innocent color, or if it's something more difficult to define, but even a light application makes skin look new and radiant.  I sometimes use my Dandelion over Benefit's That Gal primer, and sometimes alone. Either way, it the results are awesome. My skin appears dewey and fresh and young. It's amazing to contemplate that such phenomenal results can come out of a box.... Skin looking so fresh can be the basis for a multitude of make-up styles.  Another idea for you: Benefit's Benetint and High Beam are products that would really well under Dandelion. Draw the OUTLINE of a circle on your cheeks with Benetint. Do one cheek at a time, and do this quickly, as Benetint is designed to dry pretty quickly. Then draw a line across the top of the Benetint OUTLINE with High Beam, Benefit's liquid high lighter. Blend quickly. The apply Dandelion over it. The results are really beautiful and would work well for everyone. This look is perfect for day to evening, and can be the basis for an evening out, or special occasion, once you add your style with eye make-up.  Dandelion is probably the best powder available from any company. It's my favorite. If you could have only one powder, this would be the one that I'd recommend. It can be the basis for so many fantastic looks. You'll love this. It's truly awesome."

I had swapped Dandelion away because I wasn't using it in the summer but decided to re-purchase it and it was a great idea! Dandelion is a great blush and highlighter for my really pale winter skin because it is slightly cool-toned and very sheer, which keeps it from looking too obvious. A little dandelion on my cheeks and the bridge of my nose and I look considerably more awake and fresh. Sometimes I like to layer Dandelion with NARS Penny Lane cream blush for a really sweet, pink-cheeked look that works well in the winter when the cold makes me flush anyway.

Anyways, it sat in my make up drawer for a few months before I used it again and voila! It was amazing! How did I ever live without this before!?  I use this as an all over powder more than anything. I swipe it first on my cheeks and forehead and then sort of blend it out from there. This gives me an absolute glow! My skin goes from sallow to incredible with a few strokes of the brush! If I don't feel like applying blush, I just sweep this a few more times on my cheeks and it looks great. The other thing I find wonderful about this is how well it blends into my skin. For some reason, powders of any kind make me look cakey, but not this! It is flawless!  The only problem I would have is that the brush is not my favorite (although, at least it actually came with a brush) nor the boxy packaging. It totally is a part of the Benefit style, but can be clunky in the makeup bag.  I hope Benefit never discontinues this!!! (Lol...have I used enought exclamation marks on this review? :P )"

Surprisingly, the Thrrrob was not as intensely pink as I had expected, and this is another color that I can wear well. I like the fact that the box packaging keeps the extra powder inside without losing any product while you use a *real* long-handled blush brush to swirl over the powder cake. The boxes are only approx. 2 x 2 inches, so they are smaller than I expected. While I love the colors and consistency, I do not feel this is worth almost $30!

Unfortunately, the paper box is a poor container for a product that will last so long. Because of the frail container, I do not carry this item in my purse. The good thing is that the color lasts long on me so I don't really need to have it with me.  It's described as a luminizer, but I don't think that is very accurate. It is a blush.  I really don't think this would work on all complexions, but it's terrific on mine.  It is a product I would recommend as a great starter for a teenager who is beginning to use make up, because it would take a lot of effort to put too much on--it's that sheer.  Very natural and doesn't seem to be either warm or cool, so it probably works with a full range of eye/lip colors. One of my favorites."

It's not the horrid bright pink but the sheer-but-its-there pink. It almost looked like the kind of flush you get when you're in love. this time, the compliments were whose the guy? or wow, your face is really pretty tonight or the one i get most: your face is really attractive nowadays, what's your secret? I KID YOU NOT.  i know it may not work for everyone, but it did for me. and it's so great that i just felt like i had to share with everyone. try it on first and see whether you like it!"

			"review_text": "I'll admit it... initially, I was drawn to Dandelion because the box just looked so gorgeous. The fact that it's made out of a durable cardboard doesn't bother me at all. So I immediately snatched it up and excitedly took it home to see what kind of wonders it would do on my face. Once I was finished taking in the beauty of the lid, I lifted it up to reveal a square-ish, stiff brush that's included for sweeping your cheeks with. It's seperated from the highlighting powder by a clear plastic liner so that you don't need to stick your hands in powder every time you need to use the brush. One sweep of this magic substance made me feel just like a princess, I'm not kidding you. The brush is very structured & packed together and quite truthfully, not exactly the best face brush out there, but I have no significant complaints about it because it applies the perfect amount of shimmer to my cheeks. It's not luxuriously soft, but not scratchy and course either, so my face doesn't get irritated by it. A couple loose strands of hair may fall out of the brush in the first couple of uses, but it's not really a problem because you can just brush them off of your face. Even though I'm asian, my skin is still exposed to a lot of sunlight, so I'm actually quite tan, which makes this powder not show up as well. However, I'm satisfied with the subtle glow it gives me, because I'm not the type of person who likes to go over-the-top for day makeup, and even then, I don't even have make up on 99% of the time. If I layer this over a little blush, it shows up more and makes my face look like it's BEAMING WITH SUNSHINE! :D Try it, it looks utterly gorgeous over blush, and doesn't look glittery or tacky at all. It takes only a second to sweep this almost-translucent pink powder over my cheeks, and I should add that it smells absolutely delicious as well. I'm not sure how to describe it; the scent is not too sweet but still pleasant, has a floral tinge to it, and smells a little like fresh lemons on a breezy day. Its fragrance isn't overpowering though; you only notice it when you're brushing it on. Even though this highlighting powder does not show up dramatically on my face, I still take joy in sweeping a bit of this on my cheeks whenever I need a mood lift. The boost of happiness that I get whenever I brush on this powder is itself enough to make my purchase more than worth it. Benefit's Dandelion is love in a box."

It sparkles and shimmers and it's a light wash of pink. Just the blush I was looking for. I gave it 4 stars because of the price and the packaging. I agree that the packaging needs to be more durable. I like the brush but it did shed bristles on my cheek at first application. But I wanted it so bad that the price didn't matter so much. I did expect the container to be larger but it was very small. I'll keep using it and looking pretty for as long as I can!"

This product has gotten mixed reviews as a blush, but I am really liking it! I am not used to blush products staying in cardboard boxes, but I do like that the higher sides help to contain the blush dust (which really is not much). I don't like the brush that comes with the product. I tried using it a few times -- bristles came off on my face. Although the brush did help me to apply the product a little heavier, I thought it removed some of my underlying makeup in the process. I switched to my fiber optic/skunk blush brush and it works great! I can build the blush coverage wtihout overdoing it, or go lighter for a more natural look. I think the product quality of Dandelion is nice and I do not need to re-apply during the day to keep the color on my cheeks; it holds up well on me. I don't know how to describe my skin tone except to say that I'm a pale-ish warm. I do like this product/shade and would consider repurchasing."

A client of mine actually asked me how my cheeks keep that soft pink glow... DANDELION OF COURSE!! :)"
