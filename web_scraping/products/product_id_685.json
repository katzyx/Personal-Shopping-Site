I have pretty round shaped eyes and I can imagine that could be why I‚Äôve always struggled keeping the corners down. This eyelash glue is so strong, I don‚Äôt have to worry about my eyelashes ever peeling up during the day! I also like how it is easier to tell when the glue is tacky with this one because it gets a little translucent when it‚Äôs ready.

PRO: stays on and does not come off CON: the tube gets a little funky after a while and the glue seems to thicken. This makes the bottom 1/4 of the glue unusable   ***TIP! I know this lash glue is difficult to remove so here‚Äôs what I do and it works wonderfully. After washing my face and removing my eye makeup with an eye makeup remover, I‚Äôll dip a cotton swab in the eye makeup remover, swipe the excess remover on my hand and then gently rub or brush the cotton swab through my lashes (like when you‚Äôre applying mascara). This technique helps get rid of all the glue and it sticks to the cotton swab(s) so I can just throw them away mess free!"

I do a couple uses on each set of falsies and then pick off the glue with my pointed tweezers. Only annoyance is that sometimes there are tiny balls of glue at the base of my lashes that don't come off with eye makeup remover, have to go in with the tweezers and be careful to pick them off without stabbing myself, but I think this happens with all lash glues.   No smell, big pro compared to the duo."

My eyes and eyelids are fairly sensitive and can water easily and this glue has given me the least amount of problems. You can reposition the lashes if needed and sometimes take the lashes off completely and move them if you have to without reapplying the glue. It‚Äôs a sting hold and keeps my 3D mink lashes on all day or night long. I rarely have issues with the ends of the lashes lifting anymore too. Taking the lashes off is easy, just be careful when pulling the glue off of the lashes. My only complaint is that I went through the product pretty quickly and the brush bristles somehow got glued to each other making application harder as time went on. I‚Äôd still recommend and can‚Äôt go back to any other brand!"

I had searched for latex free options because I knew that the latex had to be the problem and I must have developed an allergy. I heard great things about the house of lashes glue and it was really the only one that peaked my interest. IMMEDIATELY my eyes didn‚Äôt swell or twitch or water anymore and I was able to wear falsies again. But the best part is it really really sticks your lashes on great and isn‚Äôt a mess to use. You only need the littlest amount of the glue on your lash, wait for it to kinda go green and tacky and stick it on with no budge. What‚Äôs great to is that it does still have a sort of tack and stick once fully ‚Äúdried‚Äù down so if for some reason it does loosen per say a crying sesh it will easily stick back without the need to re-apply the glue."

The glue inside the bottle dries up quite fast so it‚Äôs kind of difficult to really get a good amount of glue onto the brush, but no big deal because a little does go a long way.

I apply black to the lash strip and a super thin line of clear to my (clean) eyelid and after applying the lashes I set with my eye shadow and wear a lightweight mask over my eyes when I go to bed so the lashes don't get squished by the pillow.  The glue stays flexible and the glue is easy to remove from my skin with makeup wipes and from the lash by just pulling it off. This glue has allowed me to wear lashes every day and I don't have to worry about removing and putting back on in the morning when I sleep over anywhere, the multi day wear has also greatly improved my eyelid skin.

Not to mention with duo clear it would turn white and gunky on my lash line and can't fool anyone that my lashes are naturally long and gorgeous. So I tried this glue, and I'm torn. Am i doing something wrong?? My lashes will stay where i put them all day long unless i keep itching the inner or outer corner of my eye. BUT!! It never dries down for me? Like when I touch the lash band on my eye it still feels tacky? and it never dries down? I've worn lashes for like 16 hours (bc Vegas) and it would still be tacky. I've adjusted the amount of glue and used clean lashes and it would still feel tacky. Idk if it's me or the lash glue."

			"review_text": "This product and I have a love/hate relationship, but I find I can‚Äôt function without it... so only you can choose for yourself. I only first used false eyelashes recently.. because I was always so intimidated by the process. However, I found it changed my whole look, and I could wear so little makeup & still look made up - so it‚Äôs worth the effort. But finding the right glue was clearly the issue, and duo and drugstore brands were allowing corners to pop off. So as always I went with YOUR suggestions & got HOL in black which works esp well because I wear liquid eyeliner in black. The upside is JUST as you all say... the hold is AMAZING.. doesn‚Äôt compare to other brands and I never have to worry, those lashes are staying in place. NO MATTER WHAT. However I REALLY struggled my first tube. I was still clumsy with lashes & my glue tube would be in one hand and end up sitting sideways, tipping etc and I had it drip on my white bed, a pink sweater, and I‚Äôm not kidding even my cat at one point. If you‚Äôve been to see La Brea tar pits it mimics that - the stuff the dinosaurs died in because they couldn‚Äôt move. It‚Äôs NOT coming out of fabric, ever and its STICKY. So the tube opening becomes sticky over time & wand tends to dry w/clumps if you don‚Äôt close up often. Learning to apply properly is so essential because where ever the first place you touch it to will leave a small line of ‚Äòtar‚Äô on your eye that you then feel compelled to take off, and as people mention, this requires a strong oil based remover. However then you would have oily residue there. So I have found keeping q tips around with some alcohol just in case I make little mistakes. Yes it isn‚Äôt great wiping that near my eye but for me I just found it works, I‚Äôm sure each person has their solution. So now I know, lashes on before any other eye make up, before any decent piece of clothing, and very careful application taking my time to do it right with instruments that put them in the correct place first time."

However, if you have super duper oily lids like I do, the oils will mingle with the glue and mix together. It makes the glue all sticky and makes the corners of my lashes slip and slide. When this happens, some of the dissolved glue would get in my eyes and make them sting. This only happens to me when I wear lashes for a long amount of time (10+).

I have tried every single eyelash adhesive there is, most of them are white, they are supposed to dry clear but u can still see the glue( not attractive), so I started searching for the best black glue I could find and a lot of them get hard which irritates your eyes, you can feel the glue literally poking ur eye and when it‚Äôs time to take off those types of glues ..let‚Äôs just say GOOD LUCK..they end up taking ur natural eyelashes with it! Other black glues I‚Äôve tried just don‚Äôt adhere well. however the Sephora house of lashes eyelash adhesive is better than the more expensive glues out there that are similar to it but still  can‚Äôt compare to this one. It‚Äôs rubbery when dries which means it holds them in place until u take them off and when you do it‚Äôs not painful and I have noticed my eyelashes are actually growing back since using this product (the other glues I‚Äôve tried kept ripping them out:( ) I love it! It works the best for me and I have tried them all.. I have been doing fake lashes for I‚Äôd say about 15 years now (before it became as popular as it is now) so I‚Äôve had my fair share of experience and time to try just about everything to do with lashes/lash glue. Take it from me.. buy this glue if u want your lashes to stay put, feel comfortable, keep your natural lashes all the while being able to play around with beautiful fake ones.. I so wish someone could have told me this or I found this product sooner than a year ago because I had pretty long/thick natural lashes and from all the terrible glues.. I lost most of them, thanks to this one I am now growing them back. I use to think the damage I did to my natural lashes was irreversible but thnx to this product I now know I was wrong!"

I also like how it starts out a green color darker than the vial before you spread it on the lash band and it begins to dry. As with all black adhesives, I‚Äôd caution to be careful because the color intensity is extremely dark, more so than a lot of liquid liners."

They unfortunately took them out of the store I work at so i now have to get them online :( but I stocked up and bought 5 extra !! Looooveee."

Haven't really tested how water proof it is but I've cried with it on and my eyelashes stayed on so that's good. No complaints besides the first bottle i ever bought leaked everywhere the first time i used it but it that could be my fault hasn't happened since although it was difficult to clean up. Last quite a long time but does eventually dry out but for only $11 its not a problem to buy a new one. I will never use another lash glue, wish it came in a clear formula though."

HOL has a great formula and I like the applicator. I think I'll try the clear glue next though - I've smudged a couple times with this and then it's hard to fix."

I‚Äôve gone swimming with this glue on and they‚Äôve stayed on as well. If you are debating on spending th extra four dollars or so for a more expensive glue, do it. You won‚Äôt regret it. Any other eyelash glue at sephora is horrible. Hope this helps!! ‚ù§Ô∏è"
