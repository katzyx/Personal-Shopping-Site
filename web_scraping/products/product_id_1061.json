It looked more peach in the packaging, but once applied, it has a pretty peach-pink look. The product is blendable, which I LOVE! I use a brush for it, and it works GREAT! This is not splotchy at all. The pigment is amazing! The more you add, the darker it gets. Personally, I‚Äôm not very good at applying blush as I‚Äôm still learning, so I apply less and am very careful. It does not have a strong smell. The packaging is cute and simple. The product is easy to access and can be used until the very end. Highly recommend, 10/10!

The color is a fabulous shade of cool pink that looks so natural and glowy when applied. It‚Äôs very pigmented but blends in nicely creating a beautiful glow. I‚Äôve never tried makeup by Mario before, but I‚Äôm beyond impressed with this product! The texture is so lovely too, and it looks like it would last a very long time! I would absolutely recommend and repurchase it!   This product was gifted to me by Influenster in exchange for my honest opinion."

			"review_text": "This is my first time trying out Makeup By Mario and their blushes though I have always been curious. I know this formula has received many great reviews so I was hopeful. At first, I did not like this at all. It seemed to disappear into my skin and did not last at all. I even tried it the way Mario says to apply (which is over powder) and that did not work. However, when I finally found an application method that worked, not only was it bright, pigmented and glowy, but it held up after a few hours. For those wondering, I used a dense blush brush, didn't blend out too much, and set lightly using finishing powder and a big, fluffy brush. If you can afford to splurge, I would definitely recommend trying at least one shade of these blushes. *This was sent to me by influenster but my opinion is unbiased and honest."

			"review_text": "I was very excited to receive this product in exchange for my honest opinion! I received the shade paradise pink. Upon first opening the package, I was impressed by the sleek design of the packaging. I was also impressed by the fact that the blush product is the size of the packaging, oftentimes I find that the amount of product is small relative to the size of the package but that was not the case here! The shade of pink is very bright and vibrant. It is incredibly pigmented and a small amount goes a long way! As a person with light/medium skin, this shade was a bit too intense for me. I don‚Äôt want to rate it based on how it fit me as I believe a better fitting shade for my skin tone would‚Äôve also received a 5 start review, so my review is mainly based on the product itself. I do think this shade would look better on someone with darker skin.   The blush is very blendable and easily glided across my cheeks. I didn‚Äôt pick up any scent and was very pleased with its longevity. I will definitely be trying out these blushes in a shade that better fits me."
