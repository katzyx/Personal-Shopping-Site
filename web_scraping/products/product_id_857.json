			"review_text": "I have been using this hair oil for years and was shocked when I recently purchased this new bottle from sephora. Kerastatse changed their formula to what feels like a watered down version of the previous hair oil, price went from $20 to $30 and it's literal trash. The hair oil used to be the perfect amount of thick and luxurious and would leave my hair soft and shiny. This new formula is pure liquid, feels like water in your hands and does nothing at all for my hair. This new hair oil feels like a watered down version of their previous hair oil. Super disappointed as this was my go-to hair oil and will need to switch to a different brand. The price also went up 33%. This bottle used to cost $20 at sephora and now costs $30 and the product is total garbage now. I have no issue paying $30 for hair oil if the product was worth the cost but this hair oil formula is completely different and embarrassing on Kerastase if they didn't think consumers would notice they cut corners on their new formula. Do not buy. If you want higher end hair oil, switch over to Shu Uemera."

			"review_text": "I tried the original one in the glass bottle and it was amazing. The concentration was lighter and it smelled amazing! I could not keep my hands out of my hair. The “new formula” feels a little more dense. The smell is a bit odd. Plus the increase in price is really a dealbreaker. I wouldn’t have minded paying the increase if it still offered that amazing formula. But it just seems like they’re cheapening out the quality of the product just to make a few extra dollars. I will not be buying this new version. I’m sure there’s better options on the market. If they kept old formula absolutely! But this isn’t worth the price and quality."

It would actually be the first time I bought a full sized based off a sample. BUT, after looking at the reviews - it looks like the price has gone up, the product amount smaller, and the formula changing. So now I think I will pass. So sad."

That's the main issue I have is finding that perfect amount to use for best results"

And before I could use half a pump now I have to have to use a whole pump. Old bottle lasted me nearly a year, this one didn’t last three months. Guess I’m done with kerastase back to the drawing board for a new oil"

			"review_text": "I received this product free from influenster in exchange for my honest review. Kerastase is a well-known hair care product brand especially for those of us who damage our hair with bleach. The packaging is very nice and sleek and looks great on your vanity. My one complaint is that I had to look up directions on how to use it because they are absolutely tiny on the box. Some oils are better off being put on while wet and others are best on dry hair. This particular oil you can use on damp or dry hair. I absolutely love the way my hair feels afterwards. I use it on damp hair and I start my ends and work my way up to the roots. My hair is damaged because I bleach it and add fantasy colors. This makes it feel like I have absolutely no damage to my hair. It smells absolutely wonderful with a gourmand scent that does not overwhelm your senses. This is my second product from Kerastase and both have an absolutely amazing. I do have to say it can be on the pricey side but you do not need to use much of the product to get the results that you want."
