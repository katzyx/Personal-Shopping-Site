			"review_text": "2024 TF VD repackaged Honeymoon quad.  This is his iconic wet/dry formula and one of the better color stories in the lineup.  First, the embossing is my favorite part--I'm a sucker for cute details! The package is red and comes with the standard pouch but in red.  Second, the formula has strong pigment payoff with all the shades. The blendability was effortless with both synthetic and natural hair brushes. I used the shades wet & dry. I did use my finger for the more red shade in the palette.  Last, this is just a repackaged quad but with a price markup. You do pay more for the LE package change and embossment. If you don't own it and you're ok with the price tag, it's definitely one of the more popular and beautiful quads that's worth owning."
