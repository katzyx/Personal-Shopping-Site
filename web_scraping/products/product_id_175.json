	"ingredients": "Alcohol Denat., Fragrance, Water, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Alpha-Isomethyl Ionone, Ethylhexyl Salicylate, Limonene, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Hexyl Cinnamal, Citronellol, Linalool, Bht, Alcohol, Tris(Tetramethylhydroxypiperidinol) Citrate, Ext. Violet 2 (Ci 60730), Red 33 (Ci 17200), Yellow 5 (Ci 19140).",
	"how_to_use": "Suggested Usage:.-Fragrance is intensified by the warmth of your own body. Apply in the creases of your knees and elbows for a longer-lasting, stronger scent..-After applying, avoid rubbing or dabbing skin. This breaks down the fragrance, causing it to wear off more quickly..-If you prefer placing fragrance on your wrists, be sure to reapply after frequent hand-washing, as this tends to rinse off the scent..-Replace fragrance after 12 months. Expired perfumes more than a year old lose the integrity of the original scent... Eau de Toilette or Eau de Parfum?: .The difference lies in the volume of perfume oil. While EDT contains five to nine percent, EDP contains more, usually eight to 14 percent. EDPs, therefore, last longer and smell more intense.",

			"review_text": "As someone who loves a good gourmand scent, this perfume is a sweet little treat without being over-the-top. It gives me cherry vibes with a soft, powdery finish-very feminine and playful. It's the kind of fragrance that makes you feel effortlessly put-together, like you're stepping into your soft girl era. That said, the longevity isn't the best. It fades after about 4 hours, which is a bit of a letdown because I like my perfumes to last all day. But if you're okay with reapplying or you don't mind a lighter scent, this could still be a great pick. What really stands out to me is how youthful and girly it feels-like the perfect blend of sweetness and sophistication. It's giving brunch with the girls or a casual day out when you want to smell fresh and flirty. I still like it. Burberry"

Disappointed because I would have used the winter discount on a different perfume if i had known they were so similar. I kept the elixir because it lasts most of the day on me. Both are sweet scents and smell almost identical, but this one has a teeny tiny bit of a more floral scent or a fruity scent. Again, same smell but only subtle difference. On a side note, the elixir is stated to be a stronger scent but if anything it’s actually a tad softer"

It’s the perfect balance of fresh and refined, and I find myself reaching for it for both everyday wear and special occasions.

It kicks off with this super juicy mix of berries—sweet, but not over-the-top—like a perfect summer smoothie. Then, as it settles, you get these soft floral vibes from jasmine and violet that make it feel a little more grown-up without being too serious ;)  The base is where the magic happens—it’s warm, musky, and just cozy enough to feel like a hug in a bottle. Plus, it lasts forever, so you won’t need to keep reapplying all day. The scent isn’t too loud, either—people will notice it, but it won’t take over the room.    The bottle is simple but super pretty, with its blush pink tone giving total “clean girl” and “coquette” vibes. 🎀🦢  All in all, Burberry Her is playful, chic, and so easy to wear. Whether you’re running errands or heading out for drinks, it’s a go-to scent that feels fresh and fun every time. 🩵"

The scent lasts a good 6–8 hours, which is impressive, but it’s not as strong as I’d hoped for a luxury fragrance—I’d describe the sillage as moderate. The bottle design is sleek and elegant, perfectly capturing the modern yet timeless essence of the brand.  Overall, it’s a beautiful fragrance for those who enjoy sweet, fruity scents with a hint of depth. If you’re looking for a signature scent that’s feminine and versatile, Burberry Her is worth considering!  (Incentivized)"

I’ve tried a few Burberry perfumes before, but they weren’t really for me. This one pleasantly surprised me in every way. It’s light, sweet, and not too strong - everything I look for in my signature scents.   I wore it for a week to see if my opinions changed, but I actually found myself liking it more. It lasted for several hours throughout each day, which is nice since most scents dissipate too quickly. I think that this will become a regular part of my perfume rotation! I really like the sweetness of this and got several compliments throughout the week. Will definitely look into purchasing a bigger size once I run out."

However, throughout the day the scent becomes more complex and quite lovely. As the berry scent fades, the earthy undertones begin to come through, which adds complexity and, dare I say, allure. In general, this is a well-built perfume with great throw and longevity—I never had to reapply it and was still getting compliments towards the end of my work day.  Burberry has branded this perfume with a light pink colorway, but if I were in charge of the marketing for it, I would use more velvety and lush purple tones.  This perfume is a bit flirty for work, but I think it would be perfect for a spring or summer weekend in town.  I was given this sample from Influenster in exchange for my honest review."

This is the perfect perfume if you’re ready to graduate from using body spray and you want something that’s not too perfumey and musky.

It has a little of everything…. It was my favorite. The second one has a bit more sweet gourmand notes in it with a little floral in there. The third one smells more clean and fresh with a little sweet floral notes as well. They’re all unique but they all smell so good. I think I would buy a full size of the first one to start off.

I will start by saying that I was really excited to try this as I have been on the hunt for a new fragrance and Burberry is a very distinguished brand. I really wanted to like it but unfortunately it just wasn’t a fit for me. When I first sprayed it on my wrist, it had a soft, powdery, slightly sweet scent. Perhaps it’s my chemistry but after a minute or so, it took on a very artificial smell. I thought that it may be due to my soap or lotion so I tried it several times over the next few days, being certain to not apply anything else to my skin but still found it to be unpleasant. In terms of staying power, it also did not last very long and after a couple hours, there was little to no trace of it.  And so my search continues for the perfect fragrance."

I've got a ton of expensive perfumes that I've collected over the years and never had a problem with smells changing that much unless they were really old. This one smells totally different and not that great and its only been a year. Deff not thrilled about this and the price I paid only for it to smell not great with half a bottle left.

The sweet smell this has is definitely similar, on me at least (maybe my skin just likes vanilla), so if you like that one I think you'd enjoy this one, and vice versa.  I will say it does initially feel like the sweetness is a bit much for hot days, but it does become really light after you give it a little to fade. I think it's kind of just the nature of fragrances with vanilla notes, so I'd still recommend it for hot days if you don't mind that. Alternatively this could work nice for a night out or a date just because of the vanilla. It lasts quite nicely, and while it doesn't stay horribly strong it's still noticeable and the smell is very nice. I definitely think I'm going to use this for when I go out with friends and family"

More than a decade passed and this perfume brought me down memory lane. It's super light, feminine, creamy and fruity but in the lightest way.

It’s been 2 days and I can still smell it faintly. I will be repurchasing it in a full size because I am so in love. If you like the scent of jasmine and/or fruity scents, try this one!"

It’s a no-brainer — soft, feminine, lovely, does NOT induce headaches when oversprayed, can wear it in the summertime without gagging that it’s too sweet/strong/cloying.  Men seem to love this one (likely because yes, it’s soft and feminine).  It’s sweet but definitely not overly sweet.  I can’t stand sweet perfumes (they actually make me nauseous) but this one isn’t in that category.  It’s a timeless scent and can be worn by young and old alike.  It also layers & blends beautifully with vanilla scents.  I think even those who get this as a “blind buy” will love it.  As for myself, I’ll likely have this one in my collection for a long time.."

This smells exactly like the Kate spade, but without the gross Metallic smell and I am IN LOVE. 100% new favorite. I cannot stop smelling myself.

Everyone hates the smell of hospitals right but as we sat in the waiting room all I could smell was my friend. I asked her what she wearing and she replied Burberry Her. I was blown away because she lit up the entire area. It’s a warm, sweet, beautiful scent. A show stopper for sure! A few weeks later I went to Sephora at pentagon city mall just to browse. My sister wanted a new Jo Malone scent but needed assistance. Another sales associate approached me and I told her a few of my favorite scents, Baccarat 540, Bond New York Nights, Tom Ford Black Orchid she in turn recommended Burberry Her. I grabbed it and have been wearing it every day since."

The musk note is what really makes the two similar. Burberry her differs because the sweetness comes from the berries and almost fades into a sweet soap/clean scent with the musk. BR540’s sweetness is more from that cotton candy note. If you like a fragrance that is more feminine go for Burberry her or Burberry her Intense and save some money."

			"review_text": "STAY POWER: I've tried many many many fragrances as I am a former Fragrance Expert and Salesperson and this is one of the only fragrances that I've tried that stays through the day and night. I wake up with the fragrance still on me from the day before with no reapplication. If you have an issue with fragrances lasting with your body chemistry, try this one! BTW, not all Burberry fragrances are like this one. Her EDP is truly unique. I've tried literally all of the other Burberry women's fragrances and none last like this one does.  PRESENTATION: The bottle is certainly boring and not as interesting as other brands. It's not pretty to display like a Carolina Herrera or Marc Jacobs fragrance.  SCENT: It's a soft, sweet and feminine, but woody and warm fragrance. The top note is of fruity, dark berries with a hint of a feminine floral scent. Underneath all of that and as the day goes on, lies the warmth from what i believe to be sandalwood. The fragrance evolves into a more sexy and sophisticated scent throughout the night which contrasts the sweet and feminine scent from the first spray.   SIZE: I purchased the 3.3oz many many months ago and I still have most of my bottle. You don't need a lot as the fragrance projects very well, but if you do like to spray a lot it's not so strong that you'll offend everyone around you.  OVERALL: Definitely recommend for those who struggle with keeping a fragrance on their skin. Might bother sensitive noses or people who take to fragrances very well. My body does not and will make the scent of almost any fragrance disappear within 30mins (except this and Delina Exclusif by Parfums de Marly). So, big fan, it's my signature scent. Will continue to repurchase. Definitely recommend it to anyone looking to get their money's worth in a fragrance!"

If you're a seasonal rotator, I could see this being a great addition to your spring or early summer collection.  Fragrances don't last too long on my skin (3-4 hours just spraying the chest area once or twice) unless they're really strong or super warm and musky. Her Parfum lasts about 5-6 hours on my skin. I like to spritz once on my clothes if I know I'm going to have a long day and it's never too overpowering. Just get it -- so worth the hype.

I wonder if I just got a bad batch? either way, I hate it, which is a shame because it sounded like something I would love. I had the same issue with Elizabeth Arden Green Tea and Fig, I wonder if there's a common ingredient in the mix that my nose doesn't agree with. definitely try it in a store if you can, I'll probably try it again someday from a Sephora tester in hopes that I just got a bad bottle."

However when I first wore it I HATED this perfume and couldnt wait to take a shower to wash it off. I went back to try the perfume again (idk why) and for some reason, I really liked it? I think its because I gave it time to dry down and let it linger on my skin and it smells really nice on me. I've been wearing it almost every day because its grown on me."

I tested it by asking my boyfriend to smell my arm and he also stated that he could smell it. By far the longest lasting perfume on my skin that I have ever tried. Fragrance usually lingers on my clothes but I have not found a fragrance that stays put on my skin quite like this one. The smell is delicious. Not too sweet, not powdery, and this transforms with the dry down on my skin into this subtle woody/fruity scent in the best way. It is feminine, and classy. Definitely worth trying."

In my opinion this scent is much more versitle - you can wear it to the office or a night out, any time of the year. I prefer fruity and musky/woodsy scents to floral, and I truly get the best of both worlds with this scent: the top scents are very fruity (strawberry, currant and raspberry stick out to me) but the warmer notes like vanilla, amber, musk, and cashmere compliment the fruity scents so well. You don't need a lot: just one spray (or two) and done. 10/10 will continue buying"

One of my favorite scents is Marc Jacobs Daisy Love, which unfortunately has NO staying power, so I started searching for a similar scent that might last a bit longer. I came across a rec on another site for this one, which has similar notes (berry top note, floral mid, woodsy base). When I first applied it, I was FLOORED. It smelled even better than Daisy Love, and I thought, this is it! I’ve found my signature scent.   Not five minutes later, those first gorgeous notes faded, and the perfume became a powdery nightmare. It reminded me of this cheap perfume that came in a pink bottle that was all the rage when I was a teen. I don’t even remember what it was called, just that it smelled like baby powder. That’s what this smelled like. I was devastated. How could something that started so beautiful turn so horrible?  And, to my chagrin, I got the staying power I wanted with this one because it did not fade for 8 hours, even after I aggressively scrubbed my wrists."

To preface, I have been a long fan of Pink Sugar for its potently sweet and long-lasting scent, but I’ve been craving something with a dash of Chanel’s professional floral scent and this is the perfect union. It’s sugary sweet in a way that is not immature, blatantly dessert-like or overpowering, but enough to mask the traditional floral scent at its core. I was told it lasts 5+ hours on the skin and 8+ on clothing, and I’d have to agree. The spray itself is a mist, not a quick shoot from the bottle which is oddly satisfying and luxurious. Every time I inhale I smell the complexity of sweet and floral in a combo that is perfect for the office, the every day and every season, as it is not offensive to the nose or warrant for a sneeze. I can’t get over how beautifully sophisticated this fragrance is and it has instantly become my signature scent. (This is a unisex fragrance in my opinion)."

For reference, I have used the original Viva La juicy as my signature scent for more than 10 years. I use other perfumes now and then but ive never tried a fragrance that made me want to switch over.  It is so warm but not musky; it is floral, citrusy and comforting. It could easily be worn as an every day scent without being over powering. It would be great for special occasions too. And it’s a little more sophisticated than my juicy scent. I will be making the switch to this as my new signature scent!!"

For the younger kids who may not know that smell, I feel like a strawberry milkshake is a close representation of the Burberry Her opening. I really enjoy the fragrance and it lasts pretty long on my skin and clothes. As it dries down, the berry starts to fade and you get musk and amber. I never picked up any jasmine or violet, but that could be because of the way the fragrance was blended.  This is another one created by Francis Kurkdjian and I've heard comparisons between Burberry Her and Baccarat Rouge 540. While they share a similar DNA, Burberry Her is much more playful and fruity. I wouldn't mistake one for the other and they both have their appropriate time and place.  Burberry Her is a beautiful scent and I love it as a woman in my 30's. With that being said, I feel like this one is really well suited for a teenager just branching out into more complex fragrances or someone in their 20's. If I were younger, this would definitely be signature scent worthy."

Burberry Her was naturally flattering and I didn't have to constantly spray it on throughout the day. Received numerous compliments on it from friends and family. Overall, this is my new go to.

While some may not like that the scent will linger on clothing, it’s such a pleasant scent I couldn’t be upset about it. The sample size is perfect for carrying in a bag for touch ups throughout the day. I don’t typically like drowning myself in perfumes and scents, so a little goes a long way for me.

The imagery of this perfume is girly-early 20s, mini skirts, carefree love. when I out it on, I got raspberry and musk. my first impression was that, while that's a nice mix, with musk adding complexity to girly fruity raspberry, it was just an odd combination. As it dried down, I got strawberry milkshake, candy, and fli stone vitamins as a powdery, chalky note. That's not to say that it's awful, but it's just a really youthful fragrance, smells like something a 17 year old who loves London fashion and longs for maturity, but secretly loves her saccharine vices, would wear. Sillage is decent-My boyfriend could smell it sitting a few feet away from me. I could smell it 8 hours later if I sniffed my wrist, but it sticks best to clothes and hair."

I'm in a hot part of the country, but feel like this floral, spicey, musk would be improved by wear in a slightly cooler area.   This is a healthy, playful musk with a sexy floral trail.

Cloud has this quality as well, which I think is what gives them relatively similar vibes. This, however, blew me away! It has that resin-like feel from first spray through the drydown, which is outstanding with the strawberry dominated top notes. I don’t necessarily get the ice cream/sorbet typed strawberry here, but I saw someone say jammy, and I feel that describes it wonderfully. Strawberries with caramelized sugar, that melts into a not too sweet cream that gives a really beautiful dense feeling to it. It doesn’t drydown to any bandaid or antiseptic smell to me, but it holds up very, very well. I haven’t worn a Burberry fragrance since high school, but I’m so happy to have this. It’s definitely worth a try if you’re looking for a new signature scent!"

I couldn’t believe it lol. I wore it about five times and each time he instantly noticed I had it on and was all over me.   The layers of this perfume are complex and each one is different than the next. On my skin, it starts off clean and sharp with a lingering scent of jasmine. Then, as it sits, that smell disappears (unfortunately because it’s my favorite note) and turns into a sweet berry smell. That smell lingers a while and then you begin to smell the vanilla and amber a bit more.   I’ve owned Burberry perfume and I’ve never smelled a sweet scent from them, so I was pleasantly surprised. It’s not sickeningly sweet like teen spirit, but it’s a mature, warm sweetness that comforts you and entices you at the same time. I liked it when I smelled it, but I’ll admit that my husband’s love for it made me like it more. He politely let me know he’ll be buying me the full bottle."

I used to love extremely sweet scents but haven’t reached for perfumes like that in a while, so this reminded me of a more muted sweet scent I would’ve worn back in the day. I really enjoy the sweet, fruity notes with a perfect balance of softer, more sultry notes that complimented each other perfectly. I typically don’t love floral scents alone as they are too strong, but this scent was lighter and didn’t bother me whatsoever. I even received compliments when wearing the perfume. As for the negatives, I received half a vile of a small sample, so it was hard to fully test and review since it lasted maybe 3-4 wears. Additionally, I noticed that the perfume did not have a long staying power and I felt that it wore off by the time I got to wherever I was going after application."

After spraying the perfume on my wrist, I still smelled the undertone of musk and cotton, but the scent had much more depth overall. I guess the best way to describe it is a warm and fuzzy scent. I enjoy the floral scent that comes out when actually on my skin. I probably wouldn’t purchase this based on the cost. It has a beautiful, classy bottle, but it’s a pass for me. I do think it is worth trying it out to see if it works for you!"

It’s not unpleasant at all, and I’ll spritz my sample on for a change of pace, but overall, it’s very sweet - I prefer subtle, smoky florals. The most notable scent is a very bright, sweet scent that reminds me of pink rock candy or a Jolly Rancher, followed by an ending floral note. The bottle is pretty on it’s simplicity, and I think the price point is fair. The fragrance lasts a long time."

The fragrance was very strong. The product description does say that the scent is bold, but I personally think it goes beyond bold, to overpowering. Both my mom and my husband did not like the strong smell, either. The perfume had a strong alcohol scent upon first spraying it and it took a while to dissipate. Even after the scent wore off a bit, it was still overpowering; I smelled my wrist after I’d been wearing it for nearly five hours and the scent was still strong enough to make me sneeze. On a positive note, the fragrance is very long-lasting. However, I’d caution anyone with allergies or a sensitive nose against buying this fragrance since it’s so strong."

At first I was a little bit unsure because it was so strong, but once it settled down and mixed with my natural chemistry it was very light and subtle. It smells like a mix of floral and berries, with a slight woody hint. The description of the scent matches it pretty perfectly. I do wish that I had a little bit larger of a bottle to sample, because the scent fades away rather fast compared to other fragrances. I got a couple of day's use out of my sample bottle, so a few more day's worth would really give me a better idea of if I want to purchase a full sized bottle or not. Burberry fragrances are a little bit pricey, and I like Brit and London a bit more than this one. I definitely recommend this if you like floral scents.

I’ve have purchased Burberry perfumes in the past and this one hands down might be my favorite. It’s a sweeter scent perfume but not overwhelming. It’s on the lighter side and I think it’s perfect for everyday use.. when I first tried it on everyone in my house asked what it was and they said they loved it! Definitely purchasing the bigger size bottle ! Highly recommended to everyone looking for a new go-to scent I received this product complimentary for review purposes."

Once that sweetness fades and the clean scent comes out then it’s a good one. I just wish that sweetness wasn’t there at all. I got a sample complimentary from Influenster"

It has a beautiful light floral scent but my one complaint is that it is overwhelmed by a powerful sweet, musky smell. Unfortunately, as the perfume wears, the floral is all but lost and the sweetness really begins to stand out. However, I have to say this is a perfume that does grow on you after awhile. At first I didn't see myself wearing it but upon several days of wearing, I decided that this is a very sexy perfume. I think this is something you could wear out to a club or on a nice date with someone. I don't think I would wear this to work because I think that requires something fresher and brighter. This perfume though is the perfect sultry scent to wear with a slinky dress and bold eyeliner. And this perfume lasts really well, I don't find the scent fading after a few short hours which I find is a common issue with many luxury perfumes. All in all, this perfume is a 4 star find for me. It definitely has a lot of great aspects that I think many people would like."

However, the deep floral, woodsy and blackberry undertones that balance each other are kind of overshadowed by the new recognition of baby powder smell that I can’t un-smell. It’s not bad, but once you smell it you can’t not smell it. I definitely  know people who would like this, so I would recommend it for them, but You should definitely try it before you buy it. This was a sample provided by Influenster, but since it was such a small sample (typical free .05 fluid ounce sample you get from stores), I can’t actually review anything about the packaging bottle or presentation."

I wish I would have been able to try it out a few times to really see how it wears and to make up my mind on it.  At first spray, its alluring a d not overpowering, it's very feminine and floral with hint of a berry to it. As it dries down it smells musk like. It's a very interesting combo of smells/flavours.  I used it on my wrists,  behind my ears and neck area and it was gone. I would have loved to try it a couple times in my hair, and on my clothes just to get a realistic feel for it.  I love scents and all kinds of them. This is very feminine.  This would be something you could wear to work, or somewhere where you're in close proximity to others without it being too much like some scents do.  The wear time on it seems a bit short.  All in all this will be a nice scent to add to your collection."

The bottle is meant to recall the brand's first fragrance, 1981's Burberrys for Men, but in blush pink. It does smell young, and it does smell blush pink.. Her Eau de Parfum is the embodiment of the Londoner attitude, adventurous, spirited and bold. It's a dedication to the city of London—a beautiful, bustling, creative metropolis that's eclectic and full of life.Burberry Amazing fragrance"

I find it just so lovely. You can definitely pick up on the berry notes and it's not overly sweet. It's very well balanced and long lasting too. It would definitively be the perfect scent for everyday use. I absolutely love it!  I received a sample of this product complimentary for testing purposes but all opinions are truthful and my own."

With soft floral notes reminiscent of a early summer evening in a garden, and strong fruit undertones (dark cherries and a burst of citrus,) this is an excellent choice for daily or formal wear. The scent is a bit strong, especially on your pulse points, and should be used sparingly.    Due to the nature of my product, I can’t review the packaging, but Burberry is well known for their classic glass designs.   My husband absolutely adores the scent of this perfume, and stated that it is by far the best scent I have ever worn, including Díor and Lancôme scents. “It’s a very sensual scent,” to quote him.

I really don’t think I’ll purchase this for myself because of the spice at the end but it does last a long time and it does have a nice smell. It’s just not something I’d prefer.

But I didn't wash it off or anything because I wanted to love it too lol. Then it happened all over again, mom's walked past, and I was like you smell so good! So, I tried it again, and this time no bueno, I washed it off. I recently gave away a full bottle of D&G the one because it made me feel the same way. Two of the notes in it, that are the same in this are amber & musk. I don't like Amber, but I love musk the two combined is a no go for me."

I love the fruity opening and it fades down to a beautiful fresh but slightly sweet powdery scent. I would have to say I wish it lasted longer. I feel it is not an overpowering fragrance compared to some of my other perfumes, it’s a light fresh fruity scent that is beautiful for any time of year."

I sprayed this on the insert that came in the VoxBox and left it on the kitchen table. Later I was sitting in my chair in the living room and started asking my husband what cologne he was wearing and why it was so strong. That day I got a migraine and had to go lay down. The next day I was sitting at table and smelled it again. That’s when I realized it was the fragrance! So to me this smells very masculine and my head told me it was a no go.

This is something that I would classify as being a signature scent because you could easily wear it to work, in the evenings for a night out and its light enough that you could just wear it running errands without feeling overly done up.

March, and I was quite surprised, because I wanted it but I already have crazy amount of parfumes and wouldn't buy it myself :)   It is one of the rare parfumes with jasmine that I like, because it's not too heavy and overpowering. The scent combo is unusual and weird, but it smells great on me - he is sniffing my hairline even as I write this :)   It stays on for decent amount of time - I sprayed it in the early afternoon and now it's evening, and it's still there. I have already added it to my (not so small) list of favourites."

I believe its because this one has a lot of natural ingredients. But I recommend  testing it out in the store before buying it ;)"

Warm like being outdoors in the fresh air with hints of blooming flowers on the wind. Idk, it’s just gorgeous. If you haven’t smelled this yet, please do! The wear time is decent as well.

Thanks to Sephora for giving samples, I was able to get this scent “approved” by my husband as he cannot even walk into the store without getting a migraine. He bought the large bottle for me this Christmas.  SEPHORA, PLEASE KEEP CARRYING THIS SCENT!!!"
