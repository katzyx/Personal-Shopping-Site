This shower oil transforms into a luxurious, milky lather that gently cleanses while leaving my skin incredibly soft and moisturized. The subtle almond scent is both soothing and invigorating, making my shower experience feel like a spa treatment.  One of the best parts about this product is how it pairs perfectly with the L'Occitane Almond Milk Concentrate. Both products are enriched with almond oil, which is known for its nourishing and softening properties. After using the shower oil, I apply the body milk concentrate, and the combination leaves my skin feeling silky smooth and deeply hydrated. This duo has become an essential part of my skincare routine, especially for keeping my skin soft and supple all day long.  If you're looking for a shower oil that not only cleanses but also leaves your skin feeling pampered and moisturized, I highly recommend trying the L'Occitane Cleansing and Softening Shower Oil. And for the ultimate skin-softening experience, don't forget to pair it with the Almond Milk Concentrate!"

First off, the smell is giving more cabbage patch doll scent (IYKYK) than almond or even wet dog as some people said. It's not my fave, but not terrible. I've been enjoying that I can both wash AND shave with this so I've used less product in my showers this week. It's not too runny like straight up baby oil, so I haven't spilled any.  Also leaves my skin pretty soft and not oily at all. I did still moisturize my skin after I showered, but I feel like if I skipped a night of moisturizing, my skin would still be soft in the morning because of this. The price is pretty steep so I'm not 100% sure I'd pay full price for this, as I'm sure there must be something comparable at a better price, but I would potentially purchase if it were on sale and I'll definitely be looking for a more affordable similar product in the near future!"

I like to have sudsy soap to begin with when lathering all over my body. I started to put it on my loofah to get it sudsy beforehand and I did enjoy it more that way. I saw a review about how they use it for shaving their legs and that might be a more fitting way for me to use it, so I will try it. When using this oil, the scent has a nice lingering effect after your shower and you can have it even extended if you pair this with one of their lotions or body creams."

I have sensitive autoimmune skin, a lot of allergies/sensitivities and am super sensitive to scents sometimes (even ones I love), and I’ve had no issues with this, which makes me super happy. The smell is not overpowering, but feels warm and mood boosting. The smell feels familiar for some reason. I’m thinking it reminds me of Laura Mercier’s Gourmand scents like Almond Coconut, Vanille Gouremand, Amber Vanilla, etc. so if you love those, you’ll definitely love this. It reminds me of buying the LM gift sets during the holidays years ago, which I loved, but sadly a lot has changed with LM’s prices skyrocketing, packaging shrinking, etc. So this is a great alternative for a lower price point, similar scent, better form factor, and still amazing quality. Love the matching lotion oil too! The entire line would make a great gift! Highly recommend!"

It’s so easy to use, so basically this is a shower oil, not a body oil. So you apply on your body by massage it slowly, or by using a loof, and it will foam like a body wash. Then rinse it off, and you will see how soft your skin feels after, it’s incredible, and smells so nice. It leaves the skin so hydrating, and relaxing. I also love the packaging in a nice bottle with a dripping cap so classy. This is definitely a must have in your skincare routine. Your body will thank you for it especially if you have dry skin."

With dry skin, I must moisturize constantly to avoid an ashy skin tone - which I definitely don't love. This shower oil, however, has been a game changer for me! When I used it for the first time, I was expecting a greasy feeling, but was pleasantly surprised by the lightweight, moisturizing lather it created. The scent is light and hypnotic, leaving your skin feeling cleansed, soft and supple. I've even begun using this oil as a base when shaving my legs and arms!

It’s not bad necessarily, but I tend to use more floral scents so this scent is out of place in my toiletries and is a bit stronger than I would like.

			"review_text": "L'Occitane en Provence Almond Shower Oil is an exceptional bath product that elevates the everyday shower experience to a spa-like indulgence. One of its most notable features is its non-sticky formulation. Unlike many shower oils that leave a greasy residue, this one transforms into a soft, milky lather upon contact with water, which rinses off cleanly without any stickiness or annoyance.  The effectiveness of this shower oil lies in its luxurious texture and the way it gently cleanses the skin while providing deep nourishment. Its rich almond oil content ensures that your skin feels soft, hydrated, and beautifully scented with a delicate, sweet almond fragrance. This makes it an excellent choice for those who struggle with dry or sensitive skin, especially in challenging climates.  Another remarkable aspect of this product is how well it pairs with L'Occitane en Provence's Almond Milk C Concentrate. Using the shower oil first sets the stage for deeper hydration. After showering, when the skin is still slightly damp, applying the Almond Milk Concentrate locks in the moisture provided by the shower oil. This combination works synergistically to provide an intense, long-lasting hydration, leaving the skin feeling incredibly soft and smooth.  The almond shower oil is also noteworthy for its luxurious, pampering feel. The sensory experience of the almond scent and the silky texture of the oil adds a touch of luxury to your daily routine, making it a small but significant self-care ritual."

It does not thoroughly clean your skin; just adds a layer of moisture to it. It’s an extra step in your shower, and I think there are products out there at Target/Ulta/Walmart that both cleanse and moisturize deeply at a much lower price point and still with a great scent.

I have pretty dry skin so incorporating this into my routine has been the best decision I've made in awhile. Highly recommend you will feel so amazing afterward and just feel luxurious in general while using this. (:   ONLY ONE CONCERN - It does not lather the best, so I sometimes I tend to feel like I'm using more than I should to fully coat the body, hence the reason for one minus star. None the less will repurchase forever and ever.  P.S It's also AMAZING to use as a replacement for shave cream."

If you want glowing skin, lingering parfume and serious moisture, put your money towards the actual body oil or Concentre De Lait body Cream.

Unlike many of the other L'Occitane shower and hand cleansing formulations, this one does not leave your skin feeling dry. However I sometimes find it a bit too emollient as a shower product and tend to use only in winter when my skin can really use the extra boost of hydration, especially my lower legs. I follow with the 'Almond Supple Skin oil' to really lock in that moisture.

A little went a long way and it truly created such a smooth and silky surface to shave on. I saw so many people complaining about the scent, which I found to be extremely subtle & not overbearing at all so if you didn’t love the scent I definitely didn’t find that it lingered for a long time on the body. Also, it claimed to have an Earthy/woodsy scent and I think that’s a fair way to describe the undertone that you smell alongside the primary almond scent. I saw another reviewer comment on the fact that a lot of people hated how this lathered & how she had thought that was just a simple user error (-I agree & the application was actually my favorite part about this product). It does lather on “sticky” but in a good way haha. The more water that is added, the more the “stickiness” is broken up and becomes a smoother/milkier oil so I found it nice that it starts really thick that way you can kind of control how thick or thin you want it by getting more directly in the stream of water or less. The reason I gave this product 4 stars rather than 5, is because although it definitely made my shaving experience feel a lot more luxurious, I don’t know if for me personally I would want to spend the money on a product that doesn’t give very lasting or long-term results especially for this price point. My legs definitely felt “softer” as they claimed and really smooth but you could probably honestly get more out of an oil that is meant to stay on your skin once you’re out of the shower rather than just rinsed off."

At first, you might think it’s doing wonders for your skin because it will be silky and shiny.  However, after continued regular use over a few months, I realize it’s actually causing a lot of issues. It has greatly clogged my pores. I use this mainly to shave my legs, under arms, and bikini area. These areas of my body all now have tiny uncomfortable bumps.  Secondly, my skin has gotten very dried out. One of the first few ingredients in this oil is a sulfate - absolutely proven to be drying when used regularly.  Overall, this cheap and damaging oil is just hiding behind a fancy label and the idea that oil will make your skin shiny in the moment. But beware, it has ingredients that will do more harm to your skin in the long run."

You have to step out of direct water flow, then rub it on your body. You have only seconds to use as soon as it comes into contact with water. Leaves skin supple and extremely smooth and soft. Smells absolutely decadent. Works extremely well as a shaving oil, which I only use it for. I was lucky enough to buy the 16.9 oz bottle with the pump when they carried it a few years. Just found on the Loccitane website they send refills for the 16.9 oz bottle. Will be buying that very soon!! Never want to be without this product."

Just when you try and use this to get antiperspirant off, it does not work- and it is not something I would recommend unless you have very dry skin because although it is great for shaving, I usually end up using a body wash after again in specific areas just to avoid the build up of oil and the smell it creates when it hits my body chemistry.

Some say wet dog, and I don’t smell that as much as I smell a sorta plastic-like scent. Actually it’s very much the same sickly sweet smell of the rubber used for the scary Halloween masks one would try on at a Target or Walmart. Another person said it smelled of old cigars which I can definitely agree with. I wish I could attest to how well the product works... but it was recommended to me as a wet moisturizer so, with that said, I’m not using the product as intended.

I always had naturally soft skin but people obsess over rubbing and smelling me.  I actually now have to learn to say thank you instead of I know.  For over 7 years now this is all I use, I ran out one day and used my roommates Dove bodywash and ended up in front of my OBGYN the next day, I was in chemo and became allergic and over sensitive to chemicals.  This is the only thing I never got a reaction from and I love that it's also a shaving oil.  Sorry to hear that a lot of people do not like the smell.  It is similar to Almond and a soothing Vanilla scent.    I use regular Almond Oil to old my skin after showering and always have the body wash refills onhand that I get from l'occitane.  LOVE IT!"

Plain shower gel doesn't remove greasy sunscreen, and you still feel greasy when you get out of the shower, and you still smell like sunscreen. Yuck.   This oil works wonders. It doesn't lather, but it removes sunscreen easily from legs and arms. Kind of nice to add to my shaving cream for my legs as well.   The smell- it does smell like almond, but when you rinse it, you DO get a bit of that wet dog smell. It doesn't bother me terribly, and it doesn't stay with me, either, so I'm OK with it. If scents tend to stay with you you might want to rethink this oil, but I have dry skin, so scents tend to evaporate off my body pretty quickly. So the wet dog thing isn't enough of a bother for me to give up the cleaning power of this oil!"

I'm not a big fan of the smell of this, and I  have yet to see this milky foam it advertises. There's some very minor lathering, but if you like your shower products to be sudsy at all this is not for you.  I am a fan of how it makes my skin feel, though. Between winter cold and radiators, my skin us usually very dry after a shower. But this stuff leaves it feeling really soft and smooth. I don't know how well it would hold up to summer sweat as far as cleaning goes yet, but it's just about perfect for the current weather.  I may add a drop or two of essential oil to improve the scent (i don't like the brand's shea smell either, so haven't tried that shower oil). But even if I don't, its relatively faint and doesn't linger on me, so it's not a deal breaker. I got the travel bottle to give this a try and will likely  order a regular size once it's gone."

I bought the small size, and I use about a quarter amount for nearly my entire body. I thought for sure it would leave an oily residue and leave me feeling icky and like I need to take another shower, but this is an amazing formula. It turns into this milky consistency that is cleansing and as you're rubbing it in you feel a slight warm sensation and you can feel the oils a bit. After you rinse it the slight-oily feeling dissolves in the water and my skin is left feeling clean and hydrated. I absolutely love this stuff, and I'm glad I purchased it just in time for winter.

It doesn’t really lather (and because it doesn’t lather, I feel like I have to use a lot of product) and it doesn’t feel like I can really “wash” my entire body with it— I mostly just use it on my arms, chest, and legs after I’ve already washed the rest of my body.

I immediately went back to get the bigger version.  I still have KP but it doesn’t look as ‘angry’ as before.  It’s alot smoother and I’m only on day 3.

The smell is good but when it is combined with water there is a little bit of a wet dog musk smell. This is common with oil cleansers as the wet dog smell is caused by the oil in their hair meeting the water. The smell doesn’t really linger and my husband didn’t think it smelled bad at all. It is pricey but it lasts a long time and is great for dry winter skin. If you are looking for a richly scented and highly moisturizing body wash / shave oil this is a great product to try."

And just as previous reviewers have stated, this is so hydrating you can absolutely forgo lotion and still have soft, supple, HYDRATED, addictively touchable skin for the rest of the day.  Here's the issue: this is by no means a replacement for regular soap. Not because it doesn't get you clean- it absolutely does. But if you use it on parts of your body that you dont normally have to moisturize regularly, you WILL get body acne from this. After the first day, I started using this everywhere and ended up with acne over my thighs and chest, needless to say I never had breakouts in these places before.  My regular routine is about a quarter sized amount, that is enough for me to get my arms and calves. I'm not even 3/4s the way done with the bottle yet. And I'm not exactly a skinny girl... Remember, this is a cleansing OIL, the second water touches it, it spreads like crazy so a little goes a LONG way. I love this stuff and I'm never going to be without it."

I have the big bottle with the pump and I buy the plastic refill bags to save a little money. Still, I agree that it’s a tad pricey but it’s worth every penny. Aside from loving this as an all over body wash, I have completely ditched my shaving cream and use this instead and OMG my skin has never felt smoother after a shave. I have (sadly) coarse and thick hair so my razors go dull quickly and I’m prone to ingrown hairs. This oil has prevented me from razor burn and helped keep my skin silky smooth and I have less ingrown hairs now. Also, it smells delicious!"

The smell is pretty luxurious, I was surprised of how foamy-ish it gets when applying on your skin, which is nice. The formula is a little sticky, which really reminds a shower gel which have dissapointed me because I was looking for some real oil. The main reason this doesnt gets a 5 stars from me is because when you get out of the shower after applying and rinse with water, your skin doesnt feel really oily as I would expect from a shower oil, comparing to coconut oil for example.

Would not be much a problem if I skip the lotion which I always do. I was going to stock up on it while the sale is on going but it has sold out. So I can start saving money to buy me another bottle and one for my little boy too."

This isn't soap, so it is a lot like switching to a hair product that doesn't lather up. I does turn a milky white color when you emulsify it in your hands. It takes a small amount in each area, I use three small amounts per shower. It leaves your skin feeling nourished, and takes care of dry skin beautifully, and lets me skip the post-shower lotion. Its great for winter and summer, and I use it after swimming, or visiting the beach since that can be so drying to the skin.

I may have previously reviewed this but I wanted to re-review it because I finished the bottle. Since I got this around Christmas time I got it in a value set with the almond lotion and it was a great price for the two of them however after using this entire bottle up I would not repurchase it unless it was in a gift set. It smells kinda of like almonds in that it is reminscent of the jergens almond/cherry scented lotion but less sweet more real smelling. It does lather up but I would not say that it is a great lather but there is a small amount of foam. It works best if you use it with a loofah or some kind of scrub device otherwise the foam is basically non-existent. This took me about 3 to 3 + 1/2m months to use up and I was getting sick of the lack of lather so I started to use it as a shaving oil and it worked really well for that purpose, my skin was never smoother and my shave lasted longer. So I gave it 4 stars because it worked so well as a shaving oil, but as a moisturizing in shower cleansing oil I didn't like it as well in winter/colder months I needed to use a lotion after I got out of the shower to have enough moisture so I wouldn't recommend it to those who need to use lotion after showering because this won't solve your problem or make your routine simpler."

That fades into slightly less dry, tight skin on my upper legs and arms which then fades into dry-to-normal skin on my torso. Like an ombré of dry to normal skin, so if that's you too - you need to try this immediately.   It smells wonderful (sweet almond), lathers best with a shower poof, and applying directly with your hand before shaving legs changes your whole shave-game. Even with the seasonal dryness, I don't get itchy if I forget to moisturize after shaving. It feels like I already did.  If I forget the balm-to-oil to remove my eye makeup before I shower, I've used this and then followed with my usual face wash and gotten perfect results too.   This also doesn't strip my self-tanner. Since I'm pretty fair and social life is built around pools in the Texas summer, this is a big plus too.   I'm always trying new products and love to keep up with the different skincare, hair, and makeup trends, so it's rare to have a product that works so perfectly that it makes the repeat purchase list for me. There's maybe 4 items on that list, but this is one of them and has been for 5 years now during summers and winters. (Still try new things in Spring and Fall!)  Last thing - I also credit this stuff for keeping me stretch mark-free through 3 pregnancies which is how I found it in the first place. A Sephora cast member recommended it though I was looking for a different item, and I went for it. SO glad for this product."

My skin was so much soften after just one use and shaving with this stuff made shaving so much easier for me. My legs are ridiculously sensitive and it is almost painful to shave my upper thighs for some reason nowadays. I spread a little tiny bit of this on my leg, rubbed it over my entire leg and voila!!! Shaving was a breeze!! No pain whatsoever and my legs were super soft! The smell is great, too, very pleasant. It reminds me exactly, of the Jergens body lotion, the original scent. Do yourself a favor and get your hands on this stuff ladies and gentlemen!! Xoxo"

I don't mind the smell at all, it just has a faint almond mixed with soap scent, so I don't find it as bothersome as others say it is. You're not going to smell like almond oil if that's a concern. I didn't rate it five stars just because I wouldn't rely on this fully as a cleanser unless all you've done that day is lounge, and also because I personally thought it'd have more of a lotion effect. However, I put argan oil on after when I have the time and I feel like a dolphin who's been swimming for 23 years and just broke the waters surface. It's an incredible primer for moisturizer. So I do consider it a good investment because I enjoy being a human version of silk fabric."

Honestly though since it's mostly natural I'd be shocked if it lathered well in the first place. Anyways...  Smell is not bad. Doesn't smell like almond extract but has a very light perfumy smell that lingers on the skin but doesn't trail with you all day. It has a very runny consistency and does not lather well with a loofah or shower poof. I found the best thing to do was put it directly on my hands and rub on my body, then get my poof wet and scrub away. That seemed to work well. If you've never used a shower oil before, be prepared to feel like you didn't get totally clean. You won't have that squeaky clean feeling but in truth, unless you're filthy, the warm water running on your body cleans you enough. In fact, when I used this the first time my skin was so hydrated when coming out of the shower that I hated it and felt like I didn't get clean at all. But after you towel dry you realize that you are totally clean and it doesn't leave a filmy residue and your skin is not red, itchy, or taught from the warmth of the shower. It takes some getting used to. The skin on my arms and legs is pretty dry and I did feel like I still needed to put lotion and a body oil on to feel fully moisturized. However, I think if you have normal skin then this could be enough for some people. Overall, not bad. It does exactly what it claims to which is more than most brands. You get what you pay for."

I also had to use a lot of this product in order to feel fully cleansed. It was alright, but I really wouldn't repurchase. I'm actually using this on my 4 year old daughter during her bath time. She's got sensitive skin and it doesn't irritate her or make her itchy.

(Not to mention possibly waste quite a bit) It isn't a foamy body wash like most are use to, but it packs a mighty moisturizing punch! I have terribly dry skin on my body, mostly my legs and feet but combo skin on my face. This winter I had terrible dry patches on my legs that was itchy and made my olive skin look flaky. I tried so many body scrubs and butters that I was disappointed with I actually started making my own bath and body products. I was using a sugar scrub in the shower then when I got out I used a thick body butter, still the next day my skin would feel dry again. I thought I would try this oil because it looked interesting and had good reviews.       The way I applied this was after I used my regular body wash with a loofah I poured a couple of drops onto each section of my body and rubbed it in with my hands. I apied as the very last step before I actually got out of the shower. I actually turned off my water to rub this in so it could soak into my skin and wouldn't rinse off immediately. Then I used a body butter bar that I made for the shower (with beeswax or candelilla wax, grape seed, sweet almond, jojoba and fractionated cocunut oil plus Shea and kokum butters, see Natures Garden on YouTube for a great recipe and video) and rubbed the butter bar over the shower oil. It is basically like a heavy duty lotion bar with butters and waxes to seal in moisture. I then turned back on the shower to a lukewarm temp so that some of the oils and butters wouldnt all be washed away. After I got out I patted dry and didn't use ANY lotion or body butter on my body which is extremely rare. My skin felt so silky smooth and even the next day my skin was smooth and moisturized and didn't feel or look dry at all. I am really so impressed by this, i havent found anything so effective that lasts. It is more expensive than what I usually pay for bath products, but a drop or two for each section of your body is all you need. I bought the small travel bottle to see if it would work for me and I have used many times and only used about 25%. I will definitely be buying the bigger bottle. It has helped my skin tremendously. You will love it as long as you are looking for a moisturizer and not a body wash."

I haven't used this in Fall or Winter, so we'll have to see then. Results: This shower oil is pretty viscous with oil consistency and doesn't lather up into big foam. The smell is very nice and sweet, but it doesn't last on my skin as long as I'd hoped. My skin seems hydrated (but not to the point that you can forget the body lotion).

Two weekends ago I was lucky enough to go to L'Occitane and purchase the 500 ml bottle with the pump. It is absolutely to die for! I use it to shave my legs and as a body conditioner. After I have cleansed with my shower gel I massage this into my skin and let it sit for as long as I can wait. It leaves your skin feeling so soft. It's expensive so it's a once a week treat. Wish they made a perfume that smelled like this. I could bathe in the almond scent!"

My one fault I could find, is that there isnt much of a lather...somewhat, but not a lot. That being said- it could be the mesh loofah I use, which I am switching out for a reusable cloth one. I am hoping that will hold the oil better and allow me to optimize my use. I find myself using quite a bit of the oil to achieve covering my whole body. I am also aware that this is an oil, not a soap, and may just work differently than the body washes I am used to. Also I know that the chemical put into soaps and shampoos to activate a lather is very harmful and drying for your skin, so I definitely prefer to be on the safe side and not harm my skin or my health. Overall I think this is a good product and I plan on purchasing it again and exploring what else there is in the L'Occitane line as well as what other shower oils have to offer."

Because it's a cleansing oil, it rinses clean unlike shaving creams and foams, making it perfect for shaving after washing.  I have never gotten a closer and smoother shave with ANYTHING else I've ever used. I have tried a couple of other products after discovering this, but have always gone back and will never use anything else. A little bit goes a long way, too. I usually use less than a dime sized amount that sufficiently lathers one full leg. Once rinsed off, it leaves your skin incredibly soft.  I will say, the very first time I used this, the smell was very off-putting. I'm not sure if the fragrance has been toned down over the years, but the fragrance is now much softer. Or perhaps I'm just desensitized to it, I don't know. Either way, the end result makes it worth it."

It also smells very good, but not too strong and the scent doesn't stay on your skin.  Since it is so pricy, I save it for when my skin is especially dry or when I know I won't have enough time to moisturize after getting out of the shower. If this product was just a little cheaper, I'd give it 5 stars for sure. I am not against spending a lot on skincare, but not when I go through the product as quickly as I go through this."

It still feels wonderful and after I rinse it off and pat dry I can get away with not moisturizing my whole body if I am in a rush, which I would not be able to do without this.  I love the scent of this. I do not like the smell of almond extract, and am sensitive to fragrances, but this scent is lovely and subtle, and for me it is a nice treat to go to bed smelling like this lovely oil.  If you are looking for something that has a lather I would not recommend this, you would need to use quite a bit and that would be expensive. For those with dry skin I would definitely recommend this as a gentle wash for most of your body. I will definitely continue to use in the winter months."

However, after integrating this into my shower routine, my dryness is greatly lessened. I continue to see improvements as the weeks wear on. It is also useful for shaving too.  My only qualm is that this is much more expensive that I would like. There is a larger size, which is cheaper per ounce. However, i don't think I will splurge for this except for in the colder months."

The problem is that it smells funny and I couldn't put my finger on it at first but I think it smells kinda plastic-y. Since the Sephora reviews seem to be mixed on the smell, I wonder if whatever ingredient creates the scent gets old quickly? Anyway, I really really wish I could find a shower oil like this that doesn't smell funny. I may see if I can smell a few bottles in the store..."

There is a lingering, very light scent afterward that is very comforting and pleasant, and I noticed that my skin did not itch or feel as tight after using this as it normally does after a shower. I moisturize religiously and therefore rarely have issues with dry skin (even in winter) and I didn't have to apply quite as much lotion after showering with this. This isn't expensive at all, and I am definitely considering re-purchasing after my sample has run out.

This is my new favorite brand at sephora. You should also consider buying some of the other products from this company. I recently bought a gift set for myself that also included this product. the hand creams from this company are wonderful. This product however lathers wonderfully in the shower and is easy to use. my only complaint is that for 25 dollars this product goes very quickly because of the small amount thats in it. I bought this a week ago from the date of this review and already 1/4 of it has been used. Overall, this brand is just wonderful and you should try it out if you like almond scents"

I was hesitant being the kind of person who always needs to moisturize right after because my legs get itchy (dry). This shower oil blew my mind away. Not only did I get a close shave; my legs were EXTREMELY soft and hydrated. I only applied a bit of moisturizer on my knees really because I'm so used to applying some afterwards. B-E-A-U-T-I-F-U-L.

I bought a travel size bottle of this after falling in love with the smell of L'Occitane's Almond Supple Skin oil (it's the same scent) and ended up purchasing the full-sized bottle within a week. In my opinion, the smell is divine, so much so that I don't even wear my signature perfume that much anymore!  I have very dry skin on top of a pretty common condition called keratosis pilaris, which causes tiny rough bumps to show up on occasion on my arms and legs, especially when the weather is super hot or cold. Of course I can't give medical advice and nothing cures everything, but subjectively, I've seen a major improvement in the month I've been using this to shower, which is more than I can say for other products. In conjunction with dry brushing and using the Supple Skin Oil, this stuff has made my skin look better than I have seen it in a long time!  Also, after reading some other reviewers' opinions, I decided to try using it in place of shaving cream when I shave my legs and underarms, and I have to say that it has given me a closer, smoother shave than anything I have used before, didn't dry my legs out, and didn't clog up my razor like some of the other natural types of shaving cream do.  If you're on the fence, go for it! You'll be so glad you did! If the price tag stresses you out, be advised that you need very little product each time you use it; I've used less than 1/4 of my bottle in 3 weeks and still have most of a travel-sized bottle as well."

I was surprised by the fact that this functions more like an extremely smooth body wash than an oil; although it comes out like an oil in your hand, when applied and rubbed to the body, it turns into a subtly gel/cream consistency, making it much easier to adhere to the skin. I wouldn't say it lathers per say, but it definitely could function as a body wash, although I use it after cleansing with normal soap. The scent is not overwhelmingly sweet as I worried it would be, more of a soft marzipan undertone. It leaves the skin feeling like butter, and although the price point is a little high for the bottle, I think this would me a luxurious gift, and doubles as body wash and moisturizer,which helps to justify the price."

So first of all I did not go in planning on buying this, but once we got in there and smelled it, there was no weighing options. I had to buy it based off of smell alone. I even bought the big 16.9oz bottle for my boyfriend! (...he likes to smell good too but uses way too much product sometimes :-) ) After we left the store, I went straight to the shower to try it out, and it was instantly transformative on my skin! My skin tends to get very tight right after a shower, and with this oil it didn't. I used this before I shaved and it made my legs so smooth for about almost two days which rocks!  As for the smell, it smells like candy almonds, and on my body chemistry it tends to lean on the sweeter side, but on my boyfriend it tends to turn more musky. He already has had compliments from guys (!) that his cologne smells good, but he'll tell them that it's a shower oil instead.  Worth the money in my opinion, and I will definitely be buying this again when I am done."

After realizing that our old shower products weren't doing the job anymore and searching through a number of new ones that all made moisturizing claims we landed on this one.  L'Occitane Cleansing And Softening Shower Oil With Almond Oil is just different. It has a really pleasant but subtle smell that's appropriate for both sexes and it the most moisturizing body cleanser I've found. It IS pricey, but not as pricey as some other less effective shower creams/gels I've tried, and it's worth it. It leaves skin feeling clean, soft and comfortable.  It does lather, but not like a more detergent based shower gel/cream so you really do have to use it with a sponge or loofah to get the most mileage out of it. Once you've tried it and know you love it the larger 16oz pump is well worth the money.  This is a fantastic, and in my experience, somewhat unique product. Well worth a go."

I get the moisture I need, without the extra oily feeling, so even on my rushed or lazy days, I do not have to worry about dry skin.  It does have a nutty smell, but I love the way it smells and I personally do not find it overpowering. Also, the smell does not stay on the skin very long, so it will not interfere with other scents if you choose to wear perfume or lotion after applying this oil.  Lastly, the way it gently lathers makes it perfect for shaving, but do not expect a shaving cream type foam, because that is not the case. Hope this helps. Happy shopping!!!"

During the summers, I don't even need to use any body lotion or oil/moisturizer after I shower because this is moisturizing enough.

I had all but given up on ever being able to shave my underarms without some sort of irritation/inflammation disaster, and believe me, I tried it all. Homeopathic, every item available at Sephora, men's creams and funky gels and oils and serums-- everything.... Nothing worked. Then I received a free sample of this with another purchase and decided to give it a shot. I read that it could be used for shaving, figured everything else had been a wash and I might as well try it and, well... it was amazing! I can wear tank tops and swimsuits and not have to worry about horrifying locals when I reach up to fix my hair! No more painful bumps or itchy skin! I am a true believer, and love this product. I keep a little one around for traveling and a big one in the shower.  The main key is that when you use this (for shaving or otherwise) is to not be too stingy. Use enough that you get a rich, thick foamy oil and it does wonder for shaving and problem dry areas on skin. And good news! The scent is light enough that if you are sensitive to smelly lotions and oils (like me) this won't bother you at all. Anyway, try the small one and give it a shot! It's a little bit epic! :)"

If you've never tried the product before, you may want to go in-store and smell it before you buy it just to make sure you like it first. I have used it after exfoliating scrubs in the shower to add a layer of silky moisture, but I find that it works best for shaving; it does not leave me with itchy razor bumps, nor is it too oily. It provides the perfect amount of oil so that I can shave and it makes my skin super soft. Thumbs up from me - I'll be going to my local store to buy some!"

The shampoo has just the right amount of foaming action, but is not foamy like some cheap products. It feels great all over the body, and rinses clean. The dispenser size is a good value, but the refill is a great value! It comes in a larger pour container, and fills the daily shampoo container as needed, helping reduce the overall cost.

Quality, great fragrance that is absolutely not perfumed, and long-lasting cleaning and refreshing power -- whether for a morning shower or an after-workout clean-up.

Once you're finished using it, your skin is so smooth and soft. One thing from the description that I sort of disagree with is the suggestion that you can use the gel for shaving. I guess if you're out of your regular shaving cream, you could use it, but I would not suggest it, especially since it's rather pricey. For cleansing and hydrating, however, this stuff is perfect!

It starts as an oil but it won't be slippery or make your tub an oil slick.

It foams up beautifully, smells incredible, washes away cleanly without any residue. It is expensive but a little goes a long way. My bf commented about the softness and 'touchability' of my skin.

			"review_text": "I'll be very honest; at first, I was disappointed with this product. I'm giving it five stars though because, once I learned how to use it, I was amazed at the results and found that none of my initial problems with it were long-term. Here's my (very thorough) take:  I bought this because I wanted something more moisturizing. I started using this in Shanghai in the middle of the summer. Shanghai's summers are INSANELY humid and hot. Switching from soap to oil is not a bad idea in and of itself, but switching from soap to oil in the middle of the summer is a terrible idea. On especially hot days, the fact that I was showering with oil meant that I was smelling like fried food. This was disappointing too because the product truly does have a pleasant smell. It's true; it smells like an almond cookie.  *However,* the fried-food smell went away before too long, and I think it's because I started using the product differently. Here's how I've used it and found a lot of success:  Massage onto skin with your bare hands. (This will mean you'll go through the bottle faster; I think a bottle lasts me about three months.) Then, use a cloth or a bath puff to build up the lather and to exfoliate. This is VERY IMPORTANT because, when you switch from soap, your skin will still be used to the drying effects of the soap and will be producing a lot of oil for a while, to which you will now be adding even more. If you are not careful to exfoliate once you stop using soap, you will probably have a few weeks of breakouts. Just a warning, but this doesn't HAVE to be a problem if you exfoliate. Getting away from soap seems to be better in the long run though, since soap is so stripping, and stripping is aging. Just remember that; it's worth figuring out how to use this and getting through any adjustment period.  The lather with this product is really minimal, so if you apply it directly to a bath accessory rather than your body, you aren't necessarily going to get clean; you need to make sure the product gets on your skin. For best effects, apply to your skin as you stand away from the spray in the shower; otherwise, it will rinse off immediately, you will waste a lot of it, and, again, you won't get clean.  After you rubbed it on and scrubbed with a sponge or a bath puff or whatever it is that you use, *then* rinse it off.  People debate about the smell. I have a super-sensitive nose, but, yes, I do smell the almond oil on myself after getting out of the shower (others might not). The fragrance barely lasts though, so if you want to emanate a fragrance, use perfume.  You won't be greasy at ALL, but you will be amazingly moisturized. In fact, on a lot of days, I don't even have to put lotion on my legs after shaving. I'd prefer a product with more of a fragrance too, but nothing I've tried beats the moisturizing effects of this. It's awesome to be so soft without having to use any lotion (saves money and time!).  I will keep using it. However, if, next summer, I find that I'm smelling like fried food again (even after learning how to use it properly), then I'll save this as a winter-only product.  Hope that helps!"

I like that it completely dissolves deodorant and makes shaving smoother. It does soothe dry skin and leave it very soft and comfortable. What I don't like is that it doesn't smell at all like almonds to me (it's not a bad smell, it's just not of almonds), and it's very expensive. A little bit goes a long way, but still...$24 is a bit steep for 8.5oz.This is a good product but I will probably try for something cheaper & with a scent I like better next time."

The consistency is very similar to olive oil but it thickens to a creamy texture when you rub it into your skin. It feels great. I have sensitive skin and this doesn't strip my skin like most other cleansers.  An additional benefit...I had surgery about a year ago which left me with a large and exceptionally sensitive scar (aka I can't rub it or even have strong water pressure on it). I wear a lot of sunscreen which can lead to build up that is quite difficult to clean off without scrubbing/ rubbing. This cleanser is perfect for this!! I put quite a bit on my scar as soon as I hop in the shower. I leave it on while I wash my hair and the rest of my body. I put my water pressure on low and gently aim the water at my scar. The cleansing oil immediately comes off and takes all residue/ dirt with it. It's gentle and wonderful. This is literally the only product that cleans my scar so effectively and gently. I cannot recommend this enough."

If it is cracked and rashy, then a couple of days of this make it clear up pretty well.  This is the only product that seems to have made a difference in my dry skin, and I would be lost with out it.

I'm kind of lazy and never tend to remember to cream, but with this, I don't need to."

I also went through an illness that left my skin extra dry and sensitive. The L'Occitane Shower Oil QUICKLY corrected all of those skin issues. It doesn't strip the skin's natural oils but it doesn't leave an oily residue on the skin (or in the shower) either. It is low foaming but effective. The scent is very pleasant."

I thought it would have more of an almond or amaretto scent, but it smells more like slightly sweet olive oil than anything else. It works well for shaving, although it is obviously not as thick as a regular shaving cream. All in all, this is a nice luxurious body wash to give as a gift or save for a rainy day, but it does not perform better than a drugstore shower oil of lower cost.  I have oily skin, so I don't use it on my face or neck. I still feel like I need to use a moisturizer afterward on my feet, elbows and knees. It rinses clean and doesn't leave much of a residue."

I use this every morning now and my skin feels NATURALLY soft and moisturized and healthy, not oily. Moisturizing after is FINALLY optional Honestly Ive never felt my skin feel this good. It makes your skin incredibly smooth and soft.  Smell is nice and soft, unisex. As is the bottle. My boyfriend could use this and his roommates wouldn't make fun of him.  It is not a typical lather, its a nice cleansing milky consistency. Wash and rinse as usual and go. Im proned to sweating, oily skin, and also sensitive arms and back. Oily or scented washes always make me break out on my arms and back. This product keeps me feeling clean and has caused no breakouts whatsoever.  I read some reviews that this product makes them feel oil coated on their skin. I havent experienced that, I havent had any problems with oily skin or oily coating after. I've experinced a wonderful and moisturizing skin treatment. I would say if you feel coated use a more lathering cleanser once a week or every other week. This wash is definitely worth using.  The only downside is that with my loofah the bottle goes quickly. Im going to try a sponge. That said, if I dont overdo it, the bottle should last me all winter, PERFECT. I dont like the price, but if I can stretch the quantity by using a better sponge, I will be buying this always. New favorite bath product. I love it so much Im buying a whole lot more from L'Occitane, Im sold."

I didn't understand how an oil, being thin, could serve as such a great body cleanser.  This product's unique viscosity was the first thing that I noticed... it was simple to spread across the body. As soon as I added water, it became not foamy, but MILKY- in a very nice way. Rinses clean and leaves me smooth.  As soon as I step out of the shower, I normally FEEL like I need my moisturizer- especially if I've just shaven. With this, I feel comfortable post-shower, and can apply moisturizer at my leisure. Actually, I think I will save money on body lotion, as I need to use less after showering with this oil.  Did I mention it smells AWESOME??? I will never use a shower gel as long as I can get my hands on this awesome, oil-turned-cleansing-milk!"

Initially this has that same great scent, but there's another fragrance beneath it that I don't particularly like- probably something to do with the foaming. Speaking of foaming, the shower oil does foam up a *little* and warm up in your hands as you apply it. It works very well for shaving and it definitely leaves your skin hydrated- if you don't have particularly dry skin you may not even need to moisturize after showering with this. I think it's great!"

This shower oil is different because when it comes out, you think that you are showering with what you would fry chicken. It however creates a foam that leaves your skin so soft and smooth!! It does not produce tons of lather, but nothing that is good for your skin does. I will never be without this during the winter. I am interested to see how this does in hot summer months, but then I could see keeping this as a shave gel for those months, as well as after swimming with chlorine. Love love love this!!

I bought this after seeing it in a magazine (Lucky), and I hoped against hope that it would help relieve the dry itchiness that is my usual winter condition. This product was everything I hoped and then some! It smells fantastic. And it's runny like oil when you first dispense it, but then you rub it into wet skin, and it lathers up like a body wash. After you rinse it off, it leaves a light film of oil that sinks into your skin and hydrates it all day long. My boyfriend even commented about how smooth and soft my skin is lately. I put it on as the last step before I get out of the shower every morning. My only complaint is that this stuff doesn't come in a 5 gallon vat because I'd totally buy it in bulk! I highly recommend this product to all women everywhere."
