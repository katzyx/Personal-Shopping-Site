			"review_text": "I bought this product in the hopes to add some shine and manage my frizz and it works extremely well. I have fairly coarse, thick hair, this is still heavy enough for me, although Iâ€™d imagine it works the best on finer hair. The consistency of the mask is pretty nice, I find I have to use a fair amount but thatâ€™s to be expected as my hair is pretty long. What I will say though, since everyone raves about the scent but doesnâ€™t describe it, itâ€™s very light but honestly kind of has a hint of pencil shavings mixed with weak perfume. If that makes sense. Not unpleasant or anything just kind of strange."
