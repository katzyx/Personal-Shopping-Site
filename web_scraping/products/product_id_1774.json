			"review_text": "I have the old version of this discovery set that contains more and some different scents, so take this with a grain of salt if you will, but honestly its kind of just disappointing. I love clean, floral, and fruity scents, but only 2/7 scents are ones that I would MAYBE consider wearing from the set I own, and those specific two perfumes aren't even included in *this* set!   Lotus pear is particularly disappointing, and their scents that say they're vanilla smell pretty much like nothing. Other than that I've found that most of their scents just smell like something that would be used to freshen the smell of a porta-potty.   Patchouli citrus and Blackberry lily are the only two scents from the original tester pack that I would MAYBE consider wearing and they're not even included in this tester pack... I would not risk it."

I made the mistake of buying this set blindly and bringing it with me to Cuba so I could have a variety of scents to choose from. In my opinion, they were all awful! Nothing pretty, feminine or even sexy about any of them."

			"review_text": "Tiny, cheap samples unlike other discovery sets like Tom Ford. Sadly, I was only able to get 2 of the 5 to even spray more than once, so I have no idea whether I like them or not. Buyer beware! I‚Äôve been buying Vanilla Woods since it was released. Ironically, that‚Äôs 1 of the 2 samples that worked! The other one was Coconut Sun. I could see people liking that especially for summer, just not for me. I was really excited to try all of them, especially the new Vanilla Amber. I‚Äôm disappointed in this poor quality of this set in terms of design and quality testing. I spent $40 with tax to test 2 samples‚Äîthat‚Äôs $20 each! I actually see the value in discovery sets and buy them a lot to test out ne fragrance LS. Between the hefty price increases, poor longevity of fragrance and need for constant reapplication, and this and the discontinuation of the Blueberry scent that I regularly bought for a bff and cousin, I‚Äôm a little more than disappointed with an otherwise absolutely phd no brand and miss the high quality products I so fondly loved for the past decade or so. It makes me wonder if my favourite fragrance will be useable and of the same quality. Very unfortunate. I think I‚Äôll take a break for a bit to see if quality improves to what the standards used to be."
