This superfood facial smells like a light tropical fruity tropical paradise in a jar it smells amazing and is not overwhelming for anyone who is sensitive to scents. This melts right into your skin from the moment you put it on , it’s not sticky , it buttery and smooth and gives you a dewy glow. This can be worn under makeup and without makeup.  No pilling and extremely moisturizing. Safe for all skin types from my own personal experience. This is the best moisturizer I’ve used and would highly recommend it. This helped clear up the dry patches on my skin and this has become part of my daily routine and forever will be part of it. This is a product you absolutely NEED if you suffer from dry skin , Eczema or anything of that nature. This feels very light weight and not heavy good for morning , day and night!   RATE ✨ 10/10"

The ACV toner by Elemis was great until it really was not, but this product was free in return for an honest review so I figured why not give it a try. Currently, I struggle with acne and acne scars. I’ve yet to find a product that could help clear my skin out until now. This cream is thick, and has a luxurious feel; So it wasn’t necessary to lather on. After washing my face, I put some on and got ready for bed. When I woke up in the morning my skin was soft , fresh and the redness that usually partners with my acne was dramatically reduced. I was genuinely very impressed and didn’t make the connection at first until I was consistent with the product. Only downside, I am not a big fan of the smell. It’s a fake fruity type of smell which I’m not a fan of , but I’ll deal with it for the results."

It may feel tacky at first, but let it soak in and allow the great combination of cocoa butter, shea, and citrus to nourish you while you sleep. The tropical scents from banana flower, lime, and citrus may be better suited for a refreshing morning facial treatment, which is the reason for my 4-star review. I believe a more relaxing aroma would be better suited for a nighttime facial cream. Also, the front label highlights camu camu but I can’t parse it out on the ingredients list. Elemis allows its products to be tested on animals where required by law, but does no animal testing of their own during production.  I received this product free via Influenster in exchange for an honest review."

Created for all skin types to address dryness, redness, & uneven texture. Key ingredients: Camu Camu (has vitamin C for a healthy glow), Cocoa Butter (provides fatty acids & hydrates skin), & Banana Flower Extract (contains antioxidants protecting skin from free radicals).  My experience: I have combination-oily, acne prone, sensitive skin. I’ve been using nightly for a week, especially on days when I’m  wearing makeup during the day & applying retinol at night. This a beautiful, rich cream with a lovely fruity bubblegum scent (reminds me of hubba bubba gum). This is sinking & absorbing well with no stickiness or greasiness. My skin is plumped & hydrated instantly. I have been waking up to glowing, clear & brighter skin in the morning. I had concerns this would cause me to breakout but I’ve experienced no breakouts. It really helps to lock in moisture after using retinol.   Overall: Don’t sleep on this cream (see what I did there). This is a great facial mask at night to rehydrate skin deeply & leave it plumped, bright & clear even after using strong products like retinol. I haven’t experienced any breakouts despite it being a thick cream & it smells of fruity bubble gum. 5/5 for me! Thank you for sending me this Elemis, it’s a new nighttime staple for me!"

My skin feels so soft and hydrated throughout the night, and it has been so helpful. I love how soft and healthy my skin looks first thing in the morning, after using the facial the night before. This facial has been such a great addition to my nighttime routine and I highly recommend giving it a try!"

It contains camu camu and banana flower to provide antioxidants like vitamin C as well as butters and oils like shea and cocoa to moisturize. I liked that the texture was slightly thicker than a gel cream but still very light and easily absorbed. I noticed that my skin looked smoother in the morning and hydrated but not oily. This also contains bentonite clay to help absorb excess oils which I suspect is why I tend not to get a lot of shine with this. This clay can be drying though depending on skin type. Overall I liked the texture and smoothing effects with this cream but wished the fragrance was a little less noticeable."

However, I did experience some mild tingling initially, likely due to the potent oils in the formula. Despite that, I love how it revitalizes my complexion overnight, making it a must-have for me"

Rich in antioxidants, it helps fight free radicals, reducing signs of aging and providing a protective barrier. Its antimicrobial properties help maintain clear skin, and its soothing, hydrating qualities make it perfect for revitalizing tired skin.  After using the Elemis Superfood Facial, I woke up looking incredibly refreshed. I just popped on a little BB cream—no concealer needed. My skin felt soft, nourished, and radiant. This product is a game-changer for a healthy, glowing complexion."

In the morning my skin has been so soft and I feel like it has been helping reduce those annoying little fine lines from fatigue and environment. I like the fruity scent but prefer no fragrance, in 2024 is it necessary to add fragrance to cosmetics? I like the ingredients of: Camu Camu, shea butter and banana flower extract.

Over the course of a week, this product became a nightly ritual that I eagerly looked forward to.  First impressions mattered, and the luxurious feel of the facial oil immediately won me over. The texture is light yet nourishing, sinking effortlessly into my skin without any greasy residue. It's packed with nutrient-rich ingredients like broccoli seed oil, flaxseed oil, and daikon radish extract, which gave me confidence that my skin was getting the best of nature's offerings."

It was a surprise that the jar is only about a third full, but based on others, this seems to be the normal amount and not a jar missing product. I saw some are mentioning the scent as a negative and it does have added fragrance along with natural scents, so I'd say avoid this if you are sensitive to fragrance. I like the scent and it doesn't seem to be too strong though. I don't even smell it once it is applied."

I often struggle with creases on my skin in the mornings from my pillow, but with this cream, that issue is a thing of the past. It feels as though it forms a protective shield over my skin, keeping it smooth and supple. Highly recommend!"

Initially, it feels just like a regular moisturizer when applied, not like a typical mask, which made me doubt its effectiveness. However, the next morning, I was pleasantly surprised by the transformation. My skin looked incredibly hydrated and plump, with fine lines appearing diminished. The pigmentation of my skin appeared brighter, and overall, my complexion seemed more refreshed and clear.  This overnight facial is perfect for the night before a significant event such as a wedding or special occasion, providing immediate, visible results. I wholeheartedly recommend the Elemis Superfood Midnight Facial—it's a must-have for anyone in need of a quick, effective skin boost. 10 out of 10!"

This had a very soothing feeling when you first apply. The mask is lightweight and absorbed well. I took a stat off for the scent—that was the only thing I didn’t love. I found the scent to be a little overpowering. I find many Elemis products to have a more spa-like essential oil/herby scent and this one was a much stronger floral/fruity scent. I am not very sensitive to fragrance but my first impression opening the package was that the scent was strong. If someone was very sensitive to scents, I would want them to know that before they tried this product. Otherwise I would 100% recommend. Very effective and high quality product!"

This prebiotic overnight cream promises to leave skin silky soft, radiant, and moisturized by morning, and I can wholeheartedly say it delivers on those promises.  The texture of the cream is luxurious—it's rich without being heavy and absorbs beautifully into my skin. As someone with combination skin that tends to get dry patches, I appreciate how well it addresses dryness without causing any greasiness. The blend of camu camu, cocoa butter, and banana flower extract works wonders. My skin looks noticeably brighter and more even, thanks to the vitamin C from the camu camu, and feels deeply nourished due to the fatty acids in the cocoa butter.  I also love that it's formulated to tackle redness and uneven texture, which are my main skincare concerns. After just a few uses, my skin feels smoother and more balanced. I wake up to a complexion that looks refreshed and healthy, and the soothing scent is an added bonus that makes my nighttime routine feel even more indulgent.  Overall, if you're looking for a powerful yet gentle overnight treatment that leaves your skin feeling like silk, I highly recommend giving the Elemis Superfood Midnight Facial a try."

It has the lightest sorbet texture and smells like an amazing berry dessert. I also like that it nourished my skin with plant antioxidants and vitamins. This is one of the best night creams I have ever tried. Though I was gifted by Elemis and I genuinely loved this product."

The blend of energizing Camu Camu, moisturizing cocoa butter, and nourishing banana flower extract works wonders on my skin. I can really see the effects of the vitamin-rich ingredients, especially the boost in radiance and the minimized signs of fatigue. It leaves my skin looking refreshed and glowing.  The cream itself is light enough for nightly use, but still feels luxurious on my skin. It's a perfect balance of rich and decadent without being too heavy, which I appreciate. I look forward to applying it each night as part of my skincare routine.  Overall, I highly recommend the Superfood Midnight Facial to anyone looking to rejuvenate their skin overnight. It's been a game-changer for me, and I'm loving how my skin looks and feels each morning!"

It's such a luxurious feeling product, absorbs nicely into the skin, and wake up to more hydrated supple skin. I use this every other night and have had great results!"

I have dry skin and it absorbs fully, making my skin feel silky soft, replenished with moisture, and fresh when I wake up. It's very moisturizing and hydrating. Don't get me wrong, I've tried so many moisturizers but this one is above all. It sounds too good to be true but what I'm saying is per my experience and what suits my skin. The creaminess and richness of this product are amazing. Very nourishing sleeping cream. The scent of this product is lovely and very satisfying. I recommend this product for all skin types especially if you have dry skin."

			"review_text": "I know it is hard to trust reviews where the customer receives a free product. But please know I am really providing my genuine thoughts. I’m a customer too and it can be hard to go through all the reviews and determine what is true or not.   I am going to start my diving into product consistency, my skin type, and how my skin reacted to this product (overall quality).  First off, I will repurchase this with my own money. I was really surprised by how much I loved this. I own the Elemis cleansing balm and love that but have never tried other products from their line.   The consistency is silky (medium thickness). It absorbs super easily and applies nicely on a serum. What I like is this does not sit on top of your skin. For example, I am not a fan of the drunk elephant polypeptide cream because it just sits on your skin. This actually absorbs!!  I have used this product for two weeks. I am about to turn 26 with oily to dry skin. Aka my t zone gets breakouts but other areas are dry. I use tretinoin about twice a week in conjunction with exfoliants (microexfoliant, and paula’s choice). I do find that my skin barrier is not always happy. When I used this I was absolutely stunned my how my skin loved it. I truly felt and saw I woke up with my skin looking hydrated.   I will say that this product is GREAT for hydration. Especially after a day where you exfoliated. Whether this is good for signs of aging, I’m not sure. The ingredients in this product point more to hydration then combating fine lines (aka you want to use more peptides or skinceuticals has a phenomenal cream).   I truly loved this.   The one con is this is fragranced. So if you have sensitive skin this might not work for you and might cause a flare. That did not happen to me after exfoliating but it has happened with other fragranced products in the past. The scent itself is not overbearing and I enjoyed it."
