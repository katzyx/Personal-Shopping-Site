The product is expensive, and the shampoo alone is completely ineffective. To see any results, you have to buy additional products like a mask conditioner, which only drives up the cost even more.Even after buying the extra products and mixing them with the shampoo and hair mask as instructed, the result was awful . My hair felt like a rock after washing! I couldn't even run my fingers through it.  I am beyond disappointed and will never purchase this shampoo again. Save your money and avoid this product at all costs."

I need a lot of product just to completely cover my scalp and although it works as a shampoo should, it feels like I need to use half the bottle for that to happen. I added two mix-ins, neither of them worked and didn’t make this shampoo any better. It’s not a bad shampoo but you’re better off buying a drugstore one for cheaper if considering this shampoo."

Too moisturizing and it looks weighted down and greasy. Not enough hair love and it comes out very angry and straw-like.  My hair fell IN LOVE with this shampoo (the whole set really). Adding the concentrate is super easy (I went with shine). When working the shampoo into a lather, my hair behaved. If your hair gets cranky here too you know exactly what I am talking about. I knew this was going to be a winner even before following with the hair mask (also amazing btw).  The shine is incredible. I wish I could capture it better on camera. Even more than the beautiful shine, is the softness it gives without weighing my hair down. Even my ends, that definitely need a trim, are looking better. There is also a very pleasing light floral scent left behind that you catch little whiffs of."

The Recovery Shampoo is enriched with arginine and works with different amino acids in each hair type formula. I tried this shampoo along with the shine enhancing hair gloss goal concentrate mix-in and the visible and lasting benefits were so impressive, but the scent just was not my favorite. Overall I’m extremely impressed with my first experience with function of beauty."

Plus, I love that this shampoo is free from harsh ingredients like parabens and sulfates, giving me peace of mind knowing that I'm taking the best possible care of my hair.  After using it for a few weeks, I noticed a significant improvement in the overall health of my hair. It looked shinier, stronger, and much healthier. I really can't recommend this product enough!

These products were gifted by Functionofbeauty, and I'd love to share my first and second impressions after using Function of Beauty products twice already. But before I do that, I want to emphasize that the fact that these products are sulfate and silicone-free, vegan, and naturally derived is a huge plus, as you definitely don't want any chemicals in your hair products that come into contact with your scalp!  I have straight hair, and I got the recovery shampoo tailored to my hair type. It's formulated with lysine and has a rich-lathering formula. My hair has become pretty thin due to the frequent use of heat for straightening and curling, mostly because I do a lot of on-camera work. Consequently, the damage is visible in the condition of my hair and in some obvious split ends that I have to trim every three months. The first time I used the shampoo and the conditioning mask without the enhancing hair goal concentrate was to see the difference, and my hair felt incredibly soft and much stronger. I guess the right word to describe it is healthy. I really loved how it felt – very clean, with a fresh scent, and my hair just felt so different compared to how it was before. The amount of hair with split ends was reduced significantly, and that was one of the biggest goals that I wanted and expected to achieve when testing the Function of Beauty products!"

I used this shampoo in combination with the oily scalp mix in and my hair is feeling so good and silky. My Hair is naturally straight, but this also smooths any flyaways I have. Absolutely love!

The formula, lathers  nicely, and works well for my hair type. The scent is a white floral and very pleasant. I opted to add the oily scalp booster and noticed a little improvement."
