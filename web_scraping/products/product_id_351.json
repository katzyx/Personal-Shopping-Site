			"review_text": "I was initially anosmic to this, but I put it on the other day and just felt so warm and cozy. It has a bit of an oily scent sometimes, and that‚Äôs all I could smell at first, and I figured I was just smelling the base and was nose blind to the main perfume. The second time I wore it, I got an ‚Äúoil‚Äù scent still, but it was more of a warming massage oil, and it smelled like being in a cozy spa at an expensive, trendy hotel. It‚Äôs the strangest scent, and it‚Äôs at not a perfume in the classical sense, but it has an aura about it that undeniably improves the feeling of the world around it. If you‚Äôre into strong scents, this is probably not for you. Other things around me like trees and food smell better when I‚Äôm wearing this. That‚Äôs something I‚Äôve noticed with ‚Äúskin scents,‚Äù but this one in particular. It‚Äôs also great for layering under things. You‚Äôll just smell warm and clean (but not in an aquatic or citrus way)."

Bought the small size and was disappointed. First of all the texture was wildly watery, smelled strongly like spirits/ some kind of salicylic cleanser, very different from the soft, more oily and concentrated sample. I saw some of the reviews warning me but i was to entranced by the scent of the original that i figured whatever modifications made wouldnt matter because it smelled so heaenly. I was wrong and  disappointed. More than angry im very sad lol"
