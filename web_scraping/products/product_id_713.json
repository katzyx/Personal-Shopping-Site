My only star loss is in hotter months (I live in the Deep South for context where it gets insanely humid) I experienced some smuding under my eyes with it. Had no issue with that outside of the summer. Overall love it, not clumpy, and really easy to remove formula."

Never in my life have my eyes been irritated like they were when using this. The burning was AWFUL, made my eyes water down my face, and turned my eyes red. This mascara also doesn’t seem to dry, so by the end of the day it is smeared all over your face with barely any product in your lashes. Not exactly what it’s cracked up to be."

My only concern is the strong scent of the formula—it’s noticeable when applying, but it does fade once on. While it doesn’t linger, it’s still something to consider if you’re sensitive to scents. Overall, though, it’s a solid mascara with great results!"
