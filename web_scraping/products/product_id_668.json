It wouldn't be so bad if it dissipated quickly, but it does not. I could even tolerate it if it actually did something, but after completely emptying the bottle I can say with some confidence that it made no real difference (for me). It certainly wasn't worth the headache it would frequently cause due to its stink.  However, it is also one of the few anti-aging products that I could use on my redness prone, fussy, sensitive skin without any issues. This is considered a retinol alternative, so if you can't use any other kind of retinol, maybe give it a try and hopefully it works for you."

They recommended this product as a “softer alternative” to retinol so I gave it a go. And this is by no means a cheap product so I was hoping that it would work. Unfortunately it left everywhere I usually get oily bumpy and I had a lot more pimples appearing. Although it was leaving my cheeks feel much softer.

For reference, my skin type is: normal with a slightly dry t-zone, smooth, rarely breaks out, single deepening fine line on forehead, and noticeable hyperpigmentation. The results from the serum post two-week use have been deep hydration and some fine-line improvement. The fine line is still present, for now, but the depth has smoothed out very subtly. I apply the serum in the morning and evening. A single pump dispenses enough serum for my entire face and neck. The serum spreads easily, absorbs into my skin well, and doesn't leave a tacky film. It works very well with the rest of products I apply (moisturizer, foundation, sunscreen). The serum has a very light natural-herbal scent that doesn't linger. I find the scent uplifting. It dissipates by the time I apply foundation. Bakuchiol is the eleventh ingredient down from a host of ingredients. Thus far, this has been a gentle and non-irritating serum for me that I don't mind continue to use to see the full result after continued use. The serum was provided complimentary by Herbivore but my experience is honest as required."

Skin has definitely felt firmer and smoother (I’ve been using in tandem with Aquarius moisturizer and lapis oil during the day). The scent on this one is definitely different than other herbivore products I’ve tried, a bit fruitier. Smell isn’t very strong, but definitely there."

It has a thin creamy texture, has a light purple hue to it, and absorbs easily and quickly into the skin. My issue with it is that it has quite a bit of fragrant components, which is something my sensitive skin does not appreciate. The smell is not too strong, it's slightly sweet and fruity, but it's there."

This is by far my favorite serum that I find myself reaching for the most. Has a nice & smooth texture when applying. Woke up the next morning and my face felt great! Definitely recommend those who are on the fence with this one!"

Personally, test use by myself and family members Would like to give my zeal and honest opinions of this product, leave my authentic thoughts and feelings about the product we have tried and this is exchange the product. I received it as a gift, complimentary from Herbivore Botanicals. This is a nice Moon Fruit Serum. Notice lightening of the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles. I put about a dime-sized amount on my face and it gets instantly absorbed. Amazing serum with zero irritation and without negative results.  I like the ingredient with the five flavors of traditional Chinese medicine herbs. It promotes collagen production for firmer-looking skin. The serum makes my skin soft, smooth, and moisturized at the same time, it's very nice. I love Moon Fruit Serum so far so good."
