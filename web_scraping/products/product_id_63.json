After shaking it and testing a drop on my arm, I knew it was a waste of money. The product was still separated and the way this looks after you spread it reminds me of something oily. It’s weird and not cute at all. I love the pink color, but it is not worth it."

I like it better than the similar charlotte tilbury or Dior products.   Overall: gorgeous for pasties. I'm not sure how well it will work if you have more melanin. I'd try in person"
