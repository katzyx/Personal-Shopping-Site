This is huge for me!!!!  - My skin is super dry, so hydrating moisturizer is a NEED for me. This Isle Glow is so hydrating and lightweight. It’s a perfect combo for hot summer days when you want the hydration but you don’t want thick heavy products sitting on your skin while you’re sweating away!! And it doesn’t look greasy at all! Gives a perfect glow ✨ - I’m brown so dealing with white cast is a thing for me. The tint on this product is just the right color, no white cast just a perfect blend of color to enhance my skin tone. Overall I’m in LOVE!!"

I took this with me on my vacation to Hawaii and didn’t experience any burning on my face. This with their sunscreen balm make a perfect no makeup dewy look. This has a strong glow factor so if that’s not your thing maybe looking for something more matte but I think the flower the more hydrated the better. Has excellent skincare ingredients as well which I love because it makes it better than any old sunscreen. Had a very sheer tint to help cancel out MILD redness but I still used concealer for my dark circles. I love this product. The packaging is great. One thing to note, you may have to tap it upside down when first getting it or you may think you have a faulty pump but   Definitely recommend, especially for dry skin girlies out there."

I only use Vitamin C serum and sunscreen, so I’m not sure if the product would be different on top of foundation, concealer etc. There’s no smell to the product and it doesn’t irritate my eyes when I apply it around my eyes. I’m really impressed with this product.  My only complaint is with the packaging. The product is in a metal cylinder that becomes slippery  when you have the sunscreen on your hands, so I had to put small rubber hair bands around it to give it grip. It’s also impossible to see how much product you have left. I do think it’s great they used minimal plastic."

I was impressed that this wasn't like that at all! It has a nice natural glow. I like wearing this as my base with a little concealer where I need it. It's my go-to routine for summer. I also love the texture, it's not too thick but it still moisturizes my skin without feeling too heavy. I think this would be great to bring on vacation with you. Great ingredients and packaging!"

It's less noticeable from across the room, but when I look in the mirror, there's a noticeable artificial shimmer on my skin. There's also a very strong classic sunscreen smell that's fine for body products but that I'd prefer not to have on my face. I can also feel the product on my face during the day. It doesn't feel irritating per se, but it feels like something I don't usually wear is there, which I try to avoid.  If you like the glow, this is probably a great product for you.

It also leaves my skin feeling hydrated and soft throughout the day. And let's not forget the SPF 45 - it's a lifesaver!  One of the best things about this moisturizer is that it includes sea moss and niacinamide in the formula. The sea moss is super nourishing for the skin with tons of vitamins and minerals. It keeps my skin looking bright and healthy while providing antioxidant protection. Niacinamide helps to even out my skin tone, minimize pores, and diminish fine lines and wrinkles. Talk about a power duo!  I would totally recommend this moisturizer to any of my friends who are looking for a daily SPF that won't break the bank.

What I didn’t enjoy: the scent (I have a sensitive nose and prefer unscented products), and sometimes it pilled. Other than that, I would recommend this to anyone looking for a glowy moisturizer!

It blends very nicely and leaves a really pretty glow that is perfect for your face (I like having a bit more dramatic glow on my body). I am SO happy that this doesn't leave any white cast but also isn't tinted enough to doesn't stain my clothing or my hats! It's the perfect middle ground. The smell isn't super strong like sunscreen, and I love a product that also doubles as skincare. I don't know much about sea moss, but I love niacinamide. I'm definitely more of a chemical sunscreen girl over mineral sunscreen because it's more breathable, so that's why I figure this one works for me, and I love that it's also a Clean product!!!"

This sunscreen is lightweight, goes on easy, and doesn't have the typical sunscreen smell or white residue. It has a slightly tinted hue when you first pump it out of the bottle but then goes on smoothly and just gives a nice glowy look. I'm sure in the summer time it will look great with a bit more color on my face. Overall, I like the face lotion a lot and it will be a new staple in my morning routine."

I didn't think much of it, thinking that there must be something in the air that day. But then I used it again today, and it started happening again after I applied it. I washed my face thoroughly (RIP all my other products I had on at the time :( ) and did everything the same except this product. No eye watering.

I read a couple other reviews and I think you trade the white cast of SPF for a slight shimmer with this product. I am always looking for a SPF that doesn’t look like I’ve just slathered mayonnaise all over myself and this made me look good and protected me. A good point to remember that SPF is temporary and you must reapply- SPF 45 means you are only protected for 45 mins so as far as reapplying went I was never super shiny or greasy."

On one hand, there is glitter in here and I find that the glitter comes off when I touch my face throughout the day (I do touch my face a lot so it is noticeable when the glitter gets on my hand). If I set my face with some powder and a setting spray, it does last long and glitter doesn’t tend to wipe off. I also find that this product needs to be shaken super well to mix for the best wear. This is something that can be overcome, but I would recommend unscrewing the pump and stirring the product with it before using for the first time because the more this product mixes together, the less noticeable the glitter is.   On the other hand, I do love the way this wears on my face. It looks super glowy and there is no white cast from this product so it would look great on all skin tones. I don’t have any problems with this affecting my moisture barrier and my acne doesn’t react to this product at all.   If this is a product that interests you and is something you would wear everyday, I would recommend it. However, do be aware it may take some trial and error to get this to perform at it’s best."

I have not noticed any pilling and it absorbs fairly quickly; it doesn’t transfer especially if you’re applying appropriately by patting into the skin.

This product is AMAZING! There was no pilling, greasiness, or glitter everywhere as some reviewers stated.  I thoroughly shook the bottle before dispensing, then rubbed two pumps between my palms before applying to my face. The application will look shiny for maybe a minute tops, but dissipates shortly after leaving behind a great natural glow.

It makes my skin look amazing!“ Well, I could not argue with that! He is much fairer than I am, but it looked amazing on both of us! He has no idea that I am going to hide my full size bottle so I can keep it to myself! It is perfect for those days when you don’t want to wear make up or just want to get a few extra minutes of sleep and skip putting on make up. I like that it is SPF 45 because mini sunscreens are only SPF 30. Excellent deal! I did not have trouble with transferring or stinging if I began to sweat. I hope to see more from this line!!!"

It left a glowy finish that May be too much for oily skin. - It worked perfectly under my makeup, helping to show a glow from within. Even used by itself looks beautiful. CONS - It has a slight scent. It smells good in my opinion but, as some people are sensitive to essential oils, they should make the products without them.  - It is not transfer free, so if you touch your face, you will see the product on your fingers and it can transfer to your clothes. - It has bergamot oil that can be a photosensitizer and that’s why I give just three stars. I have melasma and I don’t want it to get even worse because of an unnecessary ingredient on the list. Cay Skin, please remove that ingredient, because the sunscreen is gorgeous!

You need to let the CAY Sunscreen settle for a few minutes before directly applying your makeup or other products. Stipple and bounce your product on top-instead of rubbing motions. I use this product as the last step to my daytime skincare regimen. As for the clumps-I warm up one full pump between my fingers and then press onto my skin, then I'll smooth it out.

Consistency: If you do not shake it, and I mean shake it vigorously for like a solid minute, then it will be chunky gold flecks and oil.

Obviously I cannot say what this looks like on other complexions, but if you are similar to mine this should look beautiful on you.   Quality: This does not pill on me. With or without makeup on top, I have not experienced that at all. If you are oily, you will likely be oily by the end of the day with this on. Reapplying was not an issue and I did feel it protected me well against the sun when I wore it outside.  All in all this is the sunscreen you wear if you want to be seen. You wear this if you want to look extra good, show off a bit, either naturally, or in addition to makeup. A day date, brunch, day party, rooftop , etc., this is the sunscreen you wear. This is not sunscreen you wear to go hiking. Would it protect you, yes, but there are more options that require a bit less maintenance. This is a special occasion sunscreen.

Additionally, if you are very fair, this may look way too bronze.

It looks like it should be a tinted moisturizer, but on your face there’s nothing more than a sheer sparkle. I also don’t have sensitive skin, but within seconds of applying, I get a burning/itching feeling. It’s got to be from some strong chemical ingredients as the product on my fingers removed some of the print on the bottle. (Paint remover?!) Hoping to return"

The sunscreen itself is composed of chemical sunscreens Avobenzone, Oxytosilate (sp?), etc. that are known eye and skin allergens. And then it’s packed with cheap perfume agents Limonene, Geraniol et al. The “island glow” is a little bit of mica and spray on tanner. Honestly, I can buy products of equal or better quality and performance at my local drugstore for a 3rd of the price and BOGO. I’m disappointed, and I have no idea why this brand would choose to lead their launch with a product that is so poorly formulated and mediocre."

I don't notice any strong smell and it sinks in easily. One thing to note is that I can't use concealer (Merit) alone over this because the finish is completely different and it will be very obvious, so I have to use either nothing after this or my concealer then powder over everything and set it with my Rare Beauty mist. It's really great for those rushed no-makeup mornings though. Love this so much that I just purchased their wildly expensive spf lip balm."

Also, to my combo skin pals out there who are afraid that chemical SPF will make your break out - this one did not. It has a lighweight texture with a very subtle tint which I would assume will work for the most skin tones.

It’s not really a big deal, it just means that i have to properly mix the product before putting it on my face. Also, for anyone wondering what the difference is between the two lotions, I think this one is more light weight and has a dewy finish, whereas the other one has more of a thick sunscreen feel and doesn’t leave as much of a dewy look.

I love that this felt like a light moisturizer because it left my skin looking dewy and feeling refreshed. Tbh, I almost felt the need to put on two layers because I was so used to the heavy feeling of other sunscreens. Made me wonder if something this breathable could actually protect my skin from the sun. I like this one and will probably use it as my winter sunscreen or during dryer seasons and climates"
