			"review_text": "this blush has gotten so much hype, so i was honestly shocked that i didn‚Äôt fall in love with it. my main issue is to do with the shade, which is very subjective, so ill first explain what i think of the performance and formula. it is pretty matte, which personally didn‚Äôt sit very nicely on my skin, but it may work better if your skin is not dry. i will note that i have never had this issue with other  matte cream blushes (i actually typically prefer them). however, it is long lasting because it is so matte. it blends out well and has a very nice level of pigment, so it is very user-friendly. it has a LOT of very large gold shimmer particles (that are not shown or mentioned ANYWHERE in the product images or product descriptions). i found the shimmer to be so glittery and chunky that it accentuated texture on my skin.   i decided to purchase this because they launched a limited edition shade (coquette) described by sephora as a ‚Äúcool soft pink‚Äù and described by WA as a ‚Äúpeachy pink.‚Äù I have very fair skin, and so i was happy to see this shade because the others are too dark for me. they don‚Äôt have WA at my local sephora, so i ordered this online. when i received it, the blush looked way more warm toned and peachy than i expected, but it still looked like a promising shade. i was SHOCKED to see that when i blended it out on my skin it went from light peachy pink to a true orange with a hint of pink. i tried to just not blend it very much to prevent it from turning orange, but it stays way too intense and pigmented if i don‚Äôt actually blend it out a normal amount. it is way too orange to suit my skin tone, so i will have to return it because i will never be able to use it. i would have kept it despite not liking the formula if the shade was usable for me, but sadly it would just collect dust if i kept it.   If you have a truly pale skin tone, i highly suggest not buying this blush, specifically shade coquette. i can see how some people would like this blush if they fo"

The formulation is buildable and has a skin like finish that doesn't need to be set with an additional blush for staying power. I have a feeling this will be my go-to for a long time.

I am not a fan of clean beauty, and I had purchased this in another color (petal) that ended up being warmer than expected, so I returned it. This is a beautiful, sophisticated formula and a beautiful color for fair, cool/neutral skin. I love the luxe magnetic packaging, and the color payoff is actually nice and buildable. It is not greasy at all, and it can be applied directly to the skin and blended out with my fingers. The only issue I have is that I have so much makeup that I'm afraid this will go bad before I finish it, and with it being a limited edition color, I can't even replace it, should I want to. This is the only color that appeals to me in the line, unfortunately. I think the people who say theirs smelled bad are right, such is the issue with clean beauty preservative systems, and I only got this because it was new stock. Mine smells fine (for now) - hopefully it stays that way for a while!"

It is definitely a good quality blush, it blends well, the color is pretty. And I will definitely use it up with no complaints, but I don't think it is unique or necessarily worth its price in any way. The packaging is on the luxe side, and feels heavy. If you like to treat yourself, go for it. If you are expecting something super ground breaking, this is not it. I also think in terms of color and texture it is very similar to Honest Beauty's cream blush in Rose Pink. That blush is fraction of the price but wears and looks basically identical."

I love it!   I've only tried the shade petal so far, and it's just the most perfect natural looking flush that would work on most skin tones. It's just the right level of pigmented - not so pigmented that it's difficult to blend, and pigmented enough to have noticeable colour. It blends like a dream and has a very beautiful, natural looking satin finish. Not matte, but not shiny either.  Granted I haven't been wearing it every day, but I don't think this product has bothered my skin at all or broken me out. The packaging is also super nice and has a really luxe feel to it - it's heavy, and the magnetic lid is a nice touch. My one gripe is the price - it's just a lot of money for the amount of product. Is it SO much better than any other cream blush that you must absolutely pay the price for this one? No, it's definitely a luxury purchase. I'm not sure if I'll repurchase or not. I do really like that it's skincare oriented blush (which most aren't) and done well, but it is worth the premium for that? Idk."

			"review_text": "I'm almost mad at how much I like this! Do I want to own and love a $48 blush? Absolutely not. But here we are! I am obsessed with the shade Poppet so much but I doubt I'll try other shades. The pigmentation and uniqueness of the color are part of why I love it, but some of the more neutral colors don't feel like they would be worth it to me. Here's why: I was honestly having buyer's remorse about purchasing such an expensive blush, not really intending to use it also as a lippie, since rarely do these types of 2-in-1 products actually work out the way I think they will. Usually, the color and/or consistency are great on one, and bad on the other. I also wasn't expecting the consistency to be something that actually stayed on long enough to wear on my lips. Well, here we are, with me loving a product that I'm still mad about the price of :)  This shade is *gorgeous* on my cheeks and lips and stays on my lips WAY longer than I thought it would. Something so creamy usually flies right off my lips the second I take a sip of coffee, but this stuff sticks around! It doesn't have the staying power of, like a true matte lipstick, but I didn't expect it to and that's not how it's marketed. I'm more shocked at how well it leaves a little blur or color, well after it should have come off. Here's where the cost/shade becomes really important for me - because the shade adds a nice wash of color to my lips and I just don't think any of the shades would show up very well. If I want to use it as both lip/cheek, it has to be a brighter shade. Anything more neutral would just only show up on my cheeks and its wayyyyy to expensive to just be a blush. If It didn't stay as well on my lips, I'd be returning. Bonus points for the magnetic lid (why don't we have more of those!?!) but minus one star for the amount of product - the tube can (and should) hold way more, given the price and honestly it feels rude to charge that much for such a small amount when the tube holds double."

I'll try Poppet.  If you are fair like me, do not assume that a paler color will be the right choice.  It's only the right choice if you want a barely-there kind of look, which if you have more natural color than me might work fine.  On me, petal made me look like a vampire. Color aside, I thought this seemed slightly patchy on my combo skin. I'll try the color Poppet and see if I do better with that.

It truly blends out into the most seamless cheek color. It can be made subtle (even Poppet on my fair skin!), or built up to be impactful. It's hydrating feeling but doesn't seem greasy. I find it pretty long lasting even without setting with loose powder or a powder blush, but setting it does make it last even longer. I just can't imagine a more perfect cream blush, but I wish the price tag wasn't so hard to swallow. That said, I know I'll have the other shades in my collection before long."

It's crazy. This blush is so highly pigmented and it lasts ALL DAY. All. Day. I haven't used one single other blush since I bought this and while other reviews say there isn't much product I can tell that even with daily use this stick will last me a year. Full disclosure I won't be using it as a lip product, only blush. If you buy it I highly recommend using a fluffier blush brush. I tired a fuller slanted brush and even being light handed it came out too strong. The fluffy brush looks perfect for a natural blush look."

It looks intimidating, but I believe this color would be flattering on most if not all skin tones.  The formula is dewy but not overly dewy. It's very flattering. My mom loves it so much I got her Dou Dou (heeheehee) as part of Christmas. I want to get Petal for myself during the next sale.

			"review_text": "As with Atelier's entire line, the packaging is gorgeous and substantial. The color options are appealing, but the color I have--Petal--described a dusky rose nude of sorts, runs a bit warm for me in person.  Because I don't use setting powder and use a BB cushion and very glow-promoting base products, it's difficult for me to wear blush in general. Though I've found that some blush tints can work over my cushion foundation without removing product, they usually don't last long. (I have yet to go for powder blush, which would be the logical solution, because I find using powder anywhere besides my eye area to prevent smudging does not bode well for my dry skin.)  Anyway, though this blush stick did not remove my foundation, I wasn't a huge fan of the way it played with it. Additionally, the color was a bit to warm for me. The formula seems creamy and nice, and I think this would be well-suited for those who don't use bb cream. I will try this again on a bare skin day, or if I wear actual foundation. Otherwise, I'm sure my sister would be thrilled to be gifted this!  Three stars, mostly because this isn't suitable for me!"

Application is easy, because it‚Äôs in a stick format. It blends out so easily even just with a finger. The color petal is the perfect tone for a pale person such as myself, but because it‚Äôs so blendable I‚Äôm not afraid to try darker or brighter shades. The finish makes your skin look healthy and youthful. My favorite part is that I am able to wear it on a bare face without it looking out of place. My only issue is that sometimes I forget I‚Äôm wearing it and I touch or wipe my face. A layer of powder would probably help with this. I did accidentally get it on my clothes once, but it luckily washed right out. IG @dontwastethemakeup"

The color of it is beautiful and I can apply it lightly to my lips, or as blush on my cheeks or I can apply it more and get even more pigment from it and make the color more colorful and noticeable. I like to use a lip brush to apply to my lips because I just feel that it‚Äôs easier to apply this way, and I use a blush brush to apply it as blush to my cheeks, and it blends out so beautifully when I use it as a blush. I am really liking this product and I love that the container it comes in is magnetic so I don‚Äôt have to worry that the lid will come off in my purse."

The blush is easy to warm up and apply and it just looks so beautiful on the skin. The product blends very easily and so gorgeously as well. You can put on a very natural amount or easily build it up for a more dramatic look. You can get a lot of use out of it as well. Plus it's a clean product!

I love that it's more like a multipurpose stick and it can also be used as an eye shadow or to give you a little color on your lips. It was blendable and easy to build up the color too.

I thought it was cheeks only. But I don't think it's clean enough to smear lip and face product from the same container anyway, so I'll still with this as a blush only."

I say lucky because Westman Atelier‚Äôs Baby Cheeks Blush Stick has made its way to my top 3 blushes of all time.  From the packaging to the application and wear time are pretty perfect.  I am absolutely in love with the packaging.  It is simple, but classy and highly portable.  Application was simple and it took little product to get the effect that I desired.  The color is buildable and super blendable.  Frankly, application was a dream.  The color also looked great on my fair-to-light skin.  There is nothing that I would change about this product and I highly recommend giving it a try."

This cream blush blends very nicely and seamlessly so if you‚Äôre going for a makeup no makeup look then you need this blush. I also used the cream blush on my eyelids and lips but it caused a reaction on my lids. I love the blush but I wouldn‚Äôt recommend using it on your eyes if you have sensitive skin. I don‚Äôt usually get a reaction from using products on my eyelids but it might contain an ingredient that shouldn‚Äôt be applied to the eye area. Also, check my last picture, I included a shot showing how much product is in the tube. The packaging is very deceiving.  For the price there is very little product but I feel it‚Äôs worth it since the quality of the blush itself is nice. But not everyone wants to pay that much for such little product. I think it‚Äôs important that we should be able to see exactly how much product is in the tube before we spend our money so I wanted to show you guys. In conclusion, I loved this blush on my cheeks and lips so I would definitely recommend it to everyone!  #complimentary #westmanatelier #vitalskincare #babycheeksblush @Influenster @westmanatelier"

The container itself is luxurious and the magnetic cap is fun. But I don‚Äôt think it would stay on well if I drop this product into a makeup bag and travel with it.   The color is good - very buildable. And I don‚Äôt have to use much, so it should last a long time (if it doesn‚Äôt melt in the Arizona heat). It has a good texture and doesn‚Äôt feel sticky."

I love the minimalist aesthetic of this so it‚Äôs beautiful on my shelf, but it also has an easy, magnetic cap which makes opening and closing the container a breeze. The color of this blush - I got Petal - is such a great neutral dusty rose color. A little goes a long way so I can‚Äôt use much given how pigmented my cheeks are already but it blends in with my natural cheek color so well. I apply this blush under my foundation, in order to even out the pick in my cheeks since the color is blotchy naturally. I also use this product on my eyes and lips.

It blended nicely and has excellent color pay off! the packaging is exceptional as well. I love the feel of the matte gray component and the magnetic closure."

Let‚Äôs start with the packaging, it‚Äôs giving me classy vintage Dior vibes, but the actual product comes in a matte gray tube with a magnetic top (I see you, Kim K vibes). The shade itself is stunning, it looks dark but once you blend it it melts perfectly into your skin. I‚Äôve tried a few cream blushes lately but this one is by far my favorite and worth every penny! Don‚Äôt think just buy!"

The packaging is heavy duty with a magnetic top and a sleek modern chic vibe. Just as the other products these have natural, cruelty free ingredients. These products contain Jojoba Seed Oil and various fruit extracts. Despite the moisturizing ingredients and the fact that the products are applied directly to the skin like a stick, I am surprised to notice that my foundation was not moved at all. Therefore, there is no need to worry as the blushes do not move any concealers or foundations. For someone who is combination/oily this was a big win! I would definitely recommend!"

One tiny gripe that I have about it is, when I opened it, the product touched the top of the lid, but that‚Äôs not a big deal, because once I used it, it stopped doing that. The color and pigmentation of the blush is absolutely perfect for a dewy look. I love that it blends in seamlessly no matter where I put it, and so far it stays really well. My skin started becoming more dry over the years, so a lot of blush would emphasize my imperfections, but this does not do that. I also love the color I was given. Having a cross between rosy and peach is what I feel looks best on my complexion. I know that whenever I run out of this, I‚Äôm running to get more. I‚Äôm also debating on purchasing more colors as well."

I prefer to apply this with a dense, flat-ended brush, which makes application quick and seamless (the WA foundation brush is perfect).

I think it'll go bad before I get through the whole stick. I bought Poppet about two weeks ago and I can't believe how much better it is than Minette. I understand some of the reviews I've read about this blush now. If each color is vastly different, then maybe some are terrible and some are amazing. Poppet is amazing. Minette is really good but not as good as Poppet.   Poppet is much creamier and the pigment is a lot more saturated than Minette. I've used it 5-6 times since I got it. I tried layering it with a blush from Menagerie cosmetics (Agarita) and together they lasted about ten hours on my face. Poppet lasts about 6 hours on its own before I see noticeable fading. I think it looks really natural on me, not like I'm wearing a ton of blush. At the same time it gives me enough of a flush where I feel like I'm made up. I included a photo of me wearing Poppet. This photo was taken about an hour after application and I used Poppet with all cream products and a very light dusting of powder. I have light/cool/olive skin, which is why this blush doesn't look as bright on me.   I definitely recommend Poppet and Minette but you should definitely read the color-specific reviews for the colors you are interested in since some of them differ!"

I'm medium to light Asian skin tone and have very dry skin.  The colour only lasted 45 min!! The smell reminded me of rancid grease (probably bc it's all natural).  My fav cream blush is Bobbie Browns coral which i think is discontinued.  If I had to choose between this or Milani cream blush, Milani wins hands down.  Milani has no rancid smell and the colour lasts longer.  If i was to keep this, I would end up going through a stick a month and then tossing out this massive plastic and metal tube which is not recyclable. for clean make up... i find this an oxymoron and you will have to use a lot of product to get any colour therefore going through many tubes of this product vs Milani or bobbi brown.  i want to try Fenty since i hear it has good colour pay off.

Normally I go for more red/terracotta colors because of my Olive/medium coloring but I decided to try Poppet based on some YouTube reviews and I have to say it‚Äôs gorgeous on my skin. I thought the vibrant pink would be too bold but it creates such a natural, healthy look and is a more realistic color for if I were actually blushing. Bichette is simply beautiful too. I can see myself reaching for this product (both colors) for days when I‚Äôm not wearing any makeup but need some color (cheeks and/or lips), or for no makeup makeup looks (I never really do heavy or full coverage makeup).

Let me just tell you: After wearing it for the first time, I pretty much ran here to add a positive review because I love this product so much and cannot understand why it isn't rated higher.   I bought the color Poppet, which is the bright pink. I'm about as pale as pale can be with neutral undertones, so I was nervous it might be too overpowering - not so. Poppet leaves the most beautiful healthy looking pink flush, somewhat reminiscent of Bobbi Brown's pale pink powder (which also looks shockingly pink in the pan) I used to use years ago. I think this color could probably flatter any skin tone. I used just one tiny stroke on each cheek, then blended it in easily with my fingers. It is pricey, for sure, but given how little I had to use for one application, I image it will last a long time.  And speaking of price... This stuff feels expensive. Maybe that doesn't matter to some, but if I'm paying for a luxury item, I want it to feel like one. The packaging in weighty and the cap goes on with a satisfying magnetic clasp. Baby Cheeks makes my morning a little more no fuss, but it also makes me feel fancy while using it. Highly recommend!"

Very not psyched about the price, but it is on another level to similar products. I previously used glossier blush and then tower 28 blush. Both were easy to use but darker in the packaging and less pigmented so blending is achieved by really spreading out the product, which subsequently leaves lighter patches if your technique isn't perfect. Upon switching to westman atelier the difference is huge. It is very pigmented and does not pull off the cheek when you blend it around. It's effortless and takes less than a minute to apply to perfectly flushed results. If you're like me, and desire the simplest and most effective makeup routine possible, this product is a winner!"

It blends poorly: I get patchy coverage regardless of the brush I use (goat hair or synthetic; pom-pom, flat, round, or angled), the amount of product I apply, or my application technique. I rarely have this problem with blush‚Äîcream, powder, or liquid‚Äîso I‚Äôm confused by this one. I love the Poppet color, but it fades away 90% within 4 hours of wear. No point reapplying it since it‚Äôll look patchy anyway. I‚Äôve used too many better cream/stick blushes to let Westman Atelier slide in this category, especially at their price point.   I haven't tried using this product on my lips because the color probably wouldn't last an hour there, and it'd feel too drying. I'm giving this product 2 stars for the lovely (though short-lived) color and the fact that it didn't cause a bad skin reaction. But I'm surprised by how badly this blush performs."

			"review_text": "I have all of these except Chouchette and Minette.  My skin is light olive /neutral, very dark eyes, dark hair. I love these as blushes and quick lip color. My favorites are Dou Dou and Poppy.  Petal is nice but not wow (for me, it didn't add anything to my collection b/c I already have nude pink blushes).  Bichette is warmer, more rust (still a brick red color) than it appears in the photo and swatches.  Poppy is intimidating but blends beautifully and brightens the face.  I like applying these with the Westman Atelier baby cheeks blush, or the Zoeva 110 face brush.  Works well with fingers, too.  The only thing I don't like about this is the packaging. I wish it was a smaller diameter to make it easier to carry and store - the grey tube seems so fact when compared to the stick of blush. The other thing I don't like is that magnetic closure....if you only have one Westman Atelier cheek or face product, I'm sure it is fine...but if you have several products, the magnets will repel each other, so they need to be a few inches apart on top of your vanity.   I also have some of the Merit blushes and I know people are curious about how they compare to the WA blush stick.  The Merit blushes are packaged such that they are smaller and lighter so that's a plus.  I do like the dark berry/red in the Merit line better than Bichette and I think the Merit blushes feel lighter on my skin and they blend out more easily and sheerly.  I have to be much more intentional with the WA and application takes longer.  For the foundation stick, my preference is Merit...but for the blushes, I like all of the above!"

It's pretty creamy, but I don't apply this directly to my cheeks. I take a brush and use it to pull some product from the stick, and then apply by stippling it on. I then blend with powder and it sets nicely. The longevity of this blush in this color is very good. It wore all day on top of foundation for 8-9 hours and it didn't fade. So, even though this is a pricier blush, it's actually very good. I definitely recommend this color!"

The color was super light, the glitter was a lot and the worst part was the smell. I actually love some smells on cosmetics. Makes it feel expensive and nice but this was overwhelming. Definitely not for me. Thinking of getting another color which might not hv glitter but am super reluctant due to the smell."

Especially this formulation - I thought that at least if the glitter stayed localized to where I applied the blush it would be fine, but I checked back in the mirror 2 hours later and while the color itself stayed put perfectly, the glitter had migrated ALL OVER MY FACE, making me look like a ball of microglitter!  No thanks. This would be a lifelong keep if they removed the glitter, though."
