			"review_text": "Patrick Ta's Major Dimensions III eyeshadow palette is a stunning collection of highly pigmented and blendable shades. The creamy liners are a dream to apply, and the neutral tones are perfectly curated for creating effortlessly chic everyday looks that flatter a range of skin tones. The sleek and sophisticated packaging elevates the overall experience. However: The price point of this palette is undeniably steep. While the quality is undeniable, it's difficult to justify the cost for many. Overall: Despite the hefty price tag, Patrick Ta's Major Dimensions III is a beautiful palette that delivers exceptional performance. If you're seeking high-quality shadows and are willing to invest, this could be a worthwhile addition to your collection. Key takeaways:  * Pros: Highly pigmented, blendable, creamy liners, beautiful neutral shades, sleek packaging  * Cons: Expensive I hope this review is helpful!"

			"review_text": "Upon picking this up, I got home excited to use it. Once I got my brush on and putting it to my eye I can smell this sourness coming from my brush thought ok weird. I swap another color and put on my second layer on again same smell coming from my brush. I smell the palate nothing stunk but only the brush. So I grabbed a new brush swap another color and same thing so not sure if the palate is old or molding? Will be returning this as I have done some research come to find out this brand is known for mold!? I wonder how long this palate has been sitting on the shelf before picking it up. But am disappointed as I really wanted to like this product. As you can see on the picture there is dots looking like mold on the black creme. For the price and the hype sorry but I have sensitive skin and my eyes has been acting up since the swap. I rather go back to my Anastasia Soft Glam for the price her palate is more pigmented too compare to this. Too bad I wasted my 20 % on this."

I couldn't believe how easily this was to work with and how beautiful I looked this would be the perfect matte wedding eyeshadow or even a everyday . I absolutely love this one.  sometimes you just need to experience things for yourself because had I listened to all the reviews I would have skipped this."

I’ve tried this with them without the cream base underneath. That’s in this pallet. They look really pretty on but then Several hours later I look in the mirror and I don’t see much eyeshadow. I don’t know if it just disappears or if the pigment fades or whatever. I’ve also use this with a eyeshadow, brush, dam and with urban decay all nighter spray. I really want to like this a lot, but I’m on the fence. I also wish this came with at least a couple of shimmers to make the colors pop."

This is - to my absolute shock and delight - perfection! - with both warmer and cooler shades that all play well together, formulation that goes on like butter with no fall off and coverage that is just right to allow for lighter to more saturated application. One of the rare neutral palettes where I'll use almost all the shades included making it the very happy end of my hunt for one palette that does it all for the mattes and one I can see working with a variety of skin tones."

The warms are too orangey for me. I am fair with blue eyes, so usually coppery brown tones look good, but these are really orange, like disco trendy orange, not a good neutral. In general I'm finding the extreme matte of these hard to blend and work with. I don't usually struggle putting on shadow, but these are um, difficult to make look right? It's just never going to be a go-to palette for me, not worth the price. I love Tartes palette of similar colors but with a few mildly sparkly light shades for highlights. I've had that one a few years and love it.  Those last forever on and are easy to work with, not so with the PT palette."

They are not dry formulas. It is very easy to blend. The cool brown next to the black is patchy. They are not suitable for use with a moisturizing primer. On the contrary, something drier is better. So, take it into account. If you have an oily eyelid, I can't recommend this palette. Successful selection of shades. I think it's a must-have. The packaging is luxurious and beautiful.The fingers are obviously marked in some areas.So, for those obsessed with everything looking perfectly clean it is chaos (I appreciate the detail that it is not completly metallic, unlike other Patrick Ta products).

I wear neutral to neutral warm foundation, but the way the bottom row pulls on me is so grey and dead. If you're cooler toned, maybe the bottom row would look better on you.   I also just don't see a big benefit to the creams in the palette, they don't hold up well enough to use as a liner without smudging.   I thought this was going to be my ultimate palette as I typically am a matte nude type of girl on a daily basis, but there are a solid 5 pans in here I probably won't ever use so at $70, I'll be returning.

I have not put this palette down. I was so excited that it came early,  that I've already done 4 looks just playing around with it. I found these shadows just blend themselves literally did all the work for me. I am so glad the brand did an all matte palette.

I do also have the makeup by mario palette and that palette is very chalky in comparison to this, so if you are debating between the two get the Patrick Ta one! I love that there are cool AND warm tone shadows in this palette. I was very iffy about the gel eyeliner as I have monolid eyes, and if it's not waterproof I will not use it.

			"review_text": "I was sent this palette by Sephora and Patrick Ta as a Sephora Beauty Insider Community Ambassador.  I prefer cooler tones so was excited to see a neutral palette that had both cool and warm tones and very much enjoy the layout of the shades.  I found the packaging to be weighted and the mirror worked great.  Pleased there was a shield over the cream shadows to prevent fallout from getting into the creams.  I first used this palette on a video call with Sephora make up artists giving direction and found that the look came out looking cakey.  The shadows themselves are VERY creamy.  It was far too easy to pick up way too much shadow.  I played around with it after that using a MUCH lighter hand being sure to pick up way less shadow and the looks weren't as intensely pigmented but looked much better in real life.  I chalk the first cakey look up to learning how to use the formula.  The cream shows were far too dark for me use as a base and when I did try, they would just lay on top of the skin, if I used less of the cream product it looked patchy on the lid.  Using the cream as a liner worked great and it was easy to line the eyes, however if I touched my eyes through the day, the liner moved, it never set, even with a powder over top.  Overall this palette has a beautiful colour story, but the cream shades aren't for me and no matter which primer I did use the mattes creased on me after only a few hours, no matter how light handed I was.  I do normally get creasing with most shadow formulas, however it usually takes longer than a few hours for this to happen.  I'm sure this could be an every day palette for some, however for me it wasn't a hit."

They are so buttery and so easy to work with. I also like that he includes 2 creams. I have the major dimension II and soon will also buy major dimensions I to complete the set. I love he gave use both cool and warm tones! Most of my other neutral palettes are warm. This is perfection."

However, its patchy application with a brush and messy results when applied with a finger left much to be desired and not worth the hassel. Despite the beautiful initial color, the disappointment followed as it began to fade and crease within a mere 6 hours. While the powders felt luxuriously soft, the excessive fallout and short wear time, lasting only up to 8 hours, marred the overall experience. Furthermore, some shades proved difficult to apply evenly with a brush, making the application process more challenging than expected. These are my honest thoughts as a Sephora Beauty Insider Community Ambassador. I did receive this as a Gratis from Sephora. I did not test the black shades."

However, the mattes are the best I have used. They blend in seconds, the cream/white are so pigmented you can nearly do a cut crease with them alone, and the cream shadows function great as bases and liners. I love having the option to do both cool/warm tones and it pairs well with single shadow toppers like the viral space cowboy by UD or Ritz by CP. Do I enjoy having it? Yes. Is it a must buy? No."

It’s a perfect palette for any occasion and I think I must have for any make up collection!"

This has very quickly become my everyday palette. The mix of cool and warm shades make it perfect for any look. The shadows are VERY pigmented. I habitually tap my brush off and it gives it a light look or you can build this up to look more dramatic. The cream shadows also have good pigment. I like to use these as smudged eyeliner along my top lash line and they apply/blend beautifully over the powder shadow.  I like to focus more on how a shadow performs than the packaging, but I know a lot of people do carry about packaging. It really does feel like a high end palette. It’s heavy and sleek and the large mirror is great for traveling.  I know this can be a high price, but out of all the palettes I’ve tried I haven’t found one with such high quality. Patrick really perfected matte eyeshadows and I don’t know how anyone will top this palette! Considering I use this everyday, I would definitely spend the money to repurchase it.   I recieved this from Influenster and Patrick Ta in exchange for my honest review."

The colors are all neutral colors that work well alone, or with other eyeshadows, as a blending or crease color. The shadows are very pigmented, smooth, and blend well. They are fairly easy to work with and look stunning on the eyes. The cream products are lovely as well. I tend to use them as eyeliner, and then I set it with a matching shadow from the palette. I could also see them working well as a base for a smokey eye. Overall, this has become my new go-to, everyday staple palette, and I will be continuing to use it."

I have used this pallet with and without the cream base and they still crease and fade. Not as bad than without. You can make some really pretty looks with this pallet. Going to try with a few eyeshadow primers to see if it helps the creasing and fading."
