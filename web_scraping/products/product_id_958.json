Wears very nice throughout the day as well, every once and a while you can smack your lips and still feel a generous amount of it on and it stays silky and smooth. Almost like it clings to your lips. When applying it does feel thick however, which I got used to very quick but was hard to enjoy. I bought the cherry vanilla, and it has a very subtle scent, which was great because you dont smell it all day. Almost like a cherry bubblegum. After a few moments when you apply you can feel a slight cooling sensation on your lips that doesn't burn. It also has a different type of applicator which I thought I would love but it grabs way too much product for myself personally, and then everything gets messy when I try and put some back. The bottle didn't spill when I let it bounce around in my purse which is a plus but it also came half full due to the shape of the bottle and applicator (with the wand in the bottle it looks full, but when you remove it there is very little product in the bottle). I've also used this when my lips were cracked and it hasn't bothered my skin at all, but I wouldn't call it 'nourishing'. 0 colour payoff. All in all, it's a very basic and boring gloss and I'm not sure it's worth $34 but I also didn't hate it. If it was cheaper I think it would be a lot more worth it for what it is and does."

I love how the wand is curved so that it contours to your lips for an even application.  It does tingle a bit when applied but that feeling goes go away after 5 minutes or so. I did notice that my lips looked fuller in about 5-10 minutes.  The formula is not sticky and glides on smoothly.  It wore well by itself for more than 4 hours.  I normally hate lip plumpers and avoid them because they make my lips look too puffy but this one wasn’t bad and gave my lips a fuller look without it looking un natural.  I got the color Lavender Sorbet which is a pretty lavender pastel pink color. Definitely worth a try if you are looking for a glossy lip plumper."

It lasted me over 4 months wearing it on week days and sometimes at home because it feel really nice and cooling. I already have natural big lips so I can't really tell if the plumping worked but I don't really care. I would %100 give this a 5 if it had more product, it lasted me quite a while more than others but maybe they were using it generously. This is really good if you're willing to repurchase and if you have the money too since it is pretty expensive. Again love the minty cooling affect, looks really nice, but I wish it had more product for the amount of money it costs. (I bought the normal 3.3 ml size)"

It smoothed out my lip lines and made my lips feel bigger. However, I repurchased in the shade Cherry Vanilla and as much as I love the product, I am beyond disappointed. The bottle came less than half full. One use and there is barely any product left in the tube. The tube also doesn’t seem to twist completely closed on this one. Maybe I got a bad bottle but other reviews show that there is barely any product immediately after opening. I didn’t think this was an issue with my first purchase, but maybe the quality has gone down. For $26 I probably can not justify buying a product that is barely full, as much as I love it. I will be on the lookout for something else that’s similar."

If I were to repurchase I do not think I would get the same color again it is too bright of a pink I feel as if a subtler one would be better for me. It also leave your lips very moisturized which I enjoy. Overall it is a bit pricey but it's worth it."

It lasts, one coat suffices, the smell is good, it tingles but doesn't burn, the color is opaque, and it's pretty hydrating for me. However I had to take off 3 stars just for the packaging/amount. All the comments saying it's not filled all the way are right. The applicator is wide so it allows it to get the gloss on the sides. But, it picks up so much product that most of it stays stuck right below the stopper. I don't use it much (average twice a day) and I feel like I'll be out within the next month. Mind you, I bought this 2 weeks ago. The applicator is also shorter than the bottle so it can't reach a quarter of the product at the bottom. If the applicator was longer and the product was filled to the top, I'd repurchase. If you have $26 to spend, I def recommend. But if you want something that will last you a while, this aint the one."
