			"review_text": "I purchased the mini size and it was indeed very mini. I was SHOCKED that I paid $13 for a sample sized tube of mascara. I don't know how many applications I'll be able to get out of this bottle but it can't be many. the product overall is ok. It has a strong floral scent that I don't love and the brush is weird because some bristles are brush like while others are stubby. I'm sure there is a reason for this but I think I prefer my cheap, Walmart mascara."

Overall, though, it’s a solid mascara with great results!"
