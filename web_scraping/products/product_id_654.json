Very gourmand indeed, and I love that.  A sophistocated gourmand at that.   BUT one star off because once this dries down, it becomes a little boring, and frankly, I know a much better vanilla that is a lot like this one that is also clean and strong and never boring (Commodity Gold Bold).  When Queens dries down, she's a powdery cocoa vanilla, then a powdery brown sugar.  Also, this is weak on the woods note.  It is heavily powder gourmand.  So, to me, this is really close to being fabulous, but it just doesn't make the cut.  So close."

It somewhat reminds me of Ormonde Jayne's Ormonde Woman. it's heady, yet clean, woody yet bordering on gourmand without being sweet. It's rather lovely. And, as a note, I absolutely despise vanilla in perfumes and most gourmands, but I didn't notice the note mentioned in the description somehow, and went ahead and purchased it. I'm so glad I did - it's very well-balanced and well-blended. I got the smaller size to start but I'll be back for the full-size soon!"

It’s a powdery woody musk, mostly sits close to the skin but has a little projection to people sitting very close to you. Lasts 3-4 hours on the skin, lingers a little longer with moisturized skin. My trick is to use a thick lotion then dab some vaseline onto pulse points (wrists, inside elbows, behind ears, neck) and then spray perfume. Don’t rub your wrists together or anything, just let it do its magic as is. Excited to try others from Henry Rose now!"

Definitely smell in store or try the travel size before blind buying. It’s very heavy/rich, I get mostly a warm/sandalwood scent with a bit of lightness almost? A bit of floral but not much. It’s very unique! I always pair it with a vanilla lotion to tone down the heaviness. The best part of this perfume is the lasting power. Perfumes usually only stay for like an 1hr max on me, but this one lasts for 6+ hours. It’s very strong and projects, I can actively smell it the entire time I’m wearing it, even when I’m not trying too. Which I love. It’s a really good quality perfume, it just depends on if you like the scent or not."

But even after drying down it still screams I'm wearing perfume! not what is that lovely scent? if that makes any sense."

Each one fits all of my many moods, but this one is the best so far. This is one that I will be wearing all year long. Gifted by Henry Rose in exchange for my honest review."

Before it arrived I did some research and was surprised to see that it's from one of the actresses I feel is a real person. Michelle Pfeiffer comes across during interviews as someone who understands normal day to day life, she just happens to be Hollywood royalty. Keeping this in mind once the package arrived, I was completely blown away by the complex simplicity of this fragrance. When you first smell it you're not sure what, where, how, why, who?! It's so subtly in your face. Yes, that is a contradiction but so is this perfume. It's masculine yet feminine. Gently strong. It lives up to everything you expect from a unisex fragrance. I am extremely feminine and it totally worked for me. To confirm my suspicion that even a very masculine person could pull it off, I asked my husband to use it one work day. He said people kept complimenting him on how he smelled. Same reaction I received. What was really fun was the day we both wore it. Others could tell our fragrance was similar, but never believing it was the same one. It totally works with ANY pH. Highly recommend this perfume. An overall great buy, not to mention a wonderful company. A+"

The longevity is medium to high which is amazing for a clean perfume, most I've tried don't last more than 4 to 5 hrs while this perfume lasts me 7 to 8 hrs and even longer on clothes. The projection is medium and during drydown feels more personal, although is marketed as a unisex fragrance it doesn't lean masculine at all.

I guess this could be an office scent for a man and more of an evening scent for a woman. It isn’t too bold but does project. I do not feel like it lasts over 3-4 hours on my skin, but slightly longer on clothes. Overall it is very easy to get along with. Gifted by Henry rose."

This is followed by a heart of yelling yelling, and Jasmine, which adds a floral and powdery sweetness finally the fragrance settles into a warm base of sandalwood and benzoin, adding a rich and woody depth.

The vanilla is sweet, but not cloyingly so, and the musk is lighter. The floral notes peel through after it dries. I spritz one squirt on my wrist and one on my neck and that’s all I need for the day. The scent isn’t overwhelming or strong, it’s soft and lovely, and I look forward to wearing it every day."
