	"about": "Fragrance Family:Earthy & Woody.Scent Type:Warm Woods.Key Notes:Sweet Violet, Palo Santo, Ambrox.Fragrance Description:Glossier You Doux is a soft, skin-scent-enhancing, woody fragrance that opens with sweet violet, followed by a precious blend of woody palo santo, frankincense, and smoky myrrh‚Äîheightened by a warm, musky base driven by ambrox..About the Bottle:The bottle is an objet d‚Äôart in its own right. It is crafted in-house at Glossier; it has the real thumbprint indent of the designer. So just like the scent, the bottle of Glossier You Doux is unfinished. It needs you to hold it to complete it..About the Fragrance:Impressions of You are not scents you wear to become someone else. Instead, they are skin-scent enhancers, meaning they smell a little bit differently on everyone. With musky, warm ambrox and ambrette base notes that wear close to the skin, they let you leave your unique impression.",
	"ingredients": "Alcohol Denat., Fragrance/Parfum, Water/Aqua/Eau, Hydroxycitronellal, Eugenol, Limonene.",
	"how_to_use": "Suggested Usage:.-Spray scent as desired on your pulse points: your neck, behind your ears, your wrists, and more..-Allow fragrance to settle for a few moments rather than rubbing it in as this can disrupt the scent..-Apply post-shower and after moisturizing to aid absorption for a longer, stronger scent impact.",

It has a subtle musky and powdered quality, but in such an amazing and refined way.  I can't believe a scent with such elegant, clean-girl vibes is available at this price point‚Äîit's an absolute steal. For context, before discovering Doux, I had three perfumes in my regular rotation, all completely different from one another: Poppy & Barley by Jo Malone, Chance (the Eau de Parfum one) by Chanel, and Th√© Noir 29 by Le Labo.  I‚Äôm shocked that Doux is the most affordable of them all because I can‚Äôt stop wearing it! I get endless compliments, and despite being a subtle fragrance, it has an impressive projection. I‚Äôve tried wearing the traditional You in the past, but it didn‚Äôt last as long on my skin. Doux, on the other hand, is incredibly long-lasting. Even when I can‚Äôt smell it on myself anymore, others still notice it and compliment me!  The scent is hard to describe, but it perfectly embodies the quiet luxury aesthetic‚Äîrefined and unique. I‚Äôm obsessed!"

Immediately afterwards, all I get is pickles. Projection is very quiet - this is the kind of perfume that others will only smell on you when they hug you. Longevity is surprisingly strong (lasted almost a week on a paper tester and a full 24hrs on my wrists) although that probably wasn't great for me because that meant I smelled like pickles the whole day. Don't listen to tiktok, everything there is aestheticized and/or advertised. If you can, try on in store before buying."

On my skin, it‚Äôs beautifully palo santo-forward with a creamy undertone, creating a scent that feels like wrapping yourself in a cashmere sweater‚Äîsoft, luxurious, and comforting. If you‚Äôre not a fan of woody or musky fragrances, this might not be for you, as it leans heavily in that direction. The response to Doux seems pretty divided, but while the original You felt universally appealing, this new iteration offers a more tailored, personal vibe while still capturing that unmistakable essence of 'you'."

This has officially replaced both of them! It's very similar. I swear if you like those you'll love this. Doux is less masculine and spicy than those scents, definitely not an exact dupe for either.

This fragrance feels like an extension of myself, enhancing my natural essence rather than masking it.  The initial burst of sweet violet is like a gentle hug soft yet comforting. As it unfolds, the earthy notes of palo santo come through, bringing a tranquil, almost meditative quality. It reminds me of walking through a serene forest, surrounded by nature's calm. As it evolves further, the hints of incense and myrrh create a rich, deep atmosphere that invites reflection.  One of the most delightful surprises has been the lasting power of this scent. Throughout the day, I find myself still enveloped in its presence. Over time, the fragrance softens, becoming more subtle yet incredibly rich, like a cherished memory that lingers in the air. The warm base of ambrox clings to my skin, making me feel grounded and at ease.  And let‚Äôs talk about the white bottle it's a beautiful piece in its own right. It feels personal and unique, as if it‚Äôs waiting for each of us to make it our own. In essence, You Doux isn‚Äôt just a perfume; it‚Äôs a tribute to individuality, reminding me that my scent is an integral part of who I am, and I really love it."

The mom noticeable characteristics of this scent are its smokiness, incense notes, woodiness, and a tad bit of sweetness. It does not have the heaviness of a strong men's cologne at all. It is still very much sweeter than anything like that. If you like those kind of notes, then this is for you.   The negative: It doesn't last very long. It's longevity is maybe 3 - 4 hours maximum despite it being an eau de parfum. I would expect this longevity from a scent that is an eau de toilettte. After that, your nose has to be pressed against your arms skin to smell it."

At first spray I wasn't sure if I really liked this scent, but after I let it dry down and mix with my skin, I absolutely loved the way it smelled. It's a very soft and feminine scent, has strong floral and woodsy notes,  and ends with a powdery smell. I love the way all the notes come together, it really is a lovely perfume. It makes me feel calm and cozy, and reminds me of what a high class, sophisticated woman would smell like. It lasts a long time on my skin and it's strong without being too overpowering.

I feels like it's screaming I AM WEARING PERFUME EVERYBODY!!! As opposed to You, which just melts into my skin and gives me an overall I smell good smell, if that makes sense. I feel like Doux is wearing ME, I am not wearing IT.  I never make reviews but I feel so strongly about loving You and I've had strangers stop me and buy it on the spot. People love it, as do I. Doux could easily bother people at work if they're sensitive to smells. It's... a lot. Pass on this one if you love You. It's nothing like You. You reigns supreme!"
