I have it in Rosé N Brunch, Dancing Queen, Jubilee, Red Velvet and Spiced Latte. I now use powder blushes only to set THIS. Not that it needs setting, with the matte powder-like finish that nothing sticks to. Note that this is INSANELY pigmented, so I have to apply with a dual-fiber stippling brush (not fingertips), I barely touch the pot with my brush and I immediately start blending. Truly a great product, I can see why it won Allure Best of Beauty."

It's creamy, but it dries down to a soft, matte, almost powdery but still creamy finish. Again, so different, but so fantastic. On both lips and cheeks it's not drying, and feels beautiful on.   I ADORE the soft, diffused finish of it. I mean, look at the photo! Bold, but still soft. There's no harsh lines, just the softly blushed color you're very likely to see on someone in a John Singer Sargent painting.  This is, hands down, my absolute FAVORITE new product! 💐🖤"

			"review_text": "I have oily skin with pores and texture, so I figured this would be a great cream blush for my makeup routine. First off, the formula is quiet innovative and impressive and I think DM is doing amazing things for the makeup space. The shade is beautiful and color payoff is great as well. But my issue with this blush is the same as the blurring balm powder. If you oily skin then this technology can work really well, but if you struggle with DEHYDRATED skin in addition to being oily, then this product may not be for you. Because it is so mattifying and blurring, it clung to my texture and pores, and ended up being super patchy and hard to blend in. Unfortunately, this was a disappointment, but I do still think Danessa is doing amazing work and creating products that aren’t just copy and paste from other brand formulas."

			"review_text": "I am 43 & do not wear makeup often, but when I do, I just love a peachy cheek to give my light skin some color & accentuate my baby blues. I always avoid cream blushes because I have VERY oily skin, some redness/acne scarring & large pores, for they always add more unwanted oil/shine, & accentuate pores, YUCKY. My go-to tarte clay blush ran out months ago, so when I recently came on my Sephora app to get more, I opted to look at other options before purchasing. I came across this Yummy Skin Blurring Balm Blush from DANESSA MYRICKS BEAUTY, which is a newer cosmetic company I have never heard. Although it is a cream formula, after reading all the promising wonderful things this does, such as oil reducing, mattifying, & actually blurring pores & fine lines (not just filling in), I skeptically decided to give this a try. Due to my light skin tone & other features, I went w/Bellini, a poppy golden peach.  Ladies, especially my 40+ mature oily skin crew, this cream to matte POWERHOUSE of a blush ACTUALLY does EVERYTHING it says it does, & BEYOND! Not only does it glide on smooth, it actually blurs pores instead of filling & accentuating them, & finishes to a soft, non-cakey matte w/long lasting GORGEOUS color.    I definitely found my new go-to blush (bye tarte, it's been a decent 6 years). If you're not sure what shade to get, they even have a chart that recommends shades for your skin tone range w/modeled images. BRAVO DMB, BRAVO! I now have to check out their other products, for if they work as wonderfully promised as this does, you have me sold.   In my picture, snapped 4 hours AFTER application & WITHOUT photoshop, I prepped w/my usual toner(Claudaile works MAGIC) & moisturizer(MUDMASKY Serum Moisturizer), then MILK Pore Eclipse Mattifying Primer & Laura Mercier Tinted Oil-Free Skin Perfector Moisturizer before applying blush. Oh, & brows by REFY Palmade, filling in my scarce, thin brows beautifully.  DO NOT HESITATE, BUY THIS MAGIC-IN-A-BLUSH NOW!"

I apply high on my cheeks with a stippling brush because a little goes a long way and as an older makeup enthusiast I am always cognizant of the risk of a Mommie Dearest look.    I also use this as a lip product and it is lighter and sheerer than the pigments in the tube so I generally wear it sheered out alone.  I only wish there was a cool rose toned option with intensity midway between this and Dancing Queen."

I absolutely LOVE it, but I can see how this product could highlight flaky, dry skin on those who choose to ignore a good skincare routine. So do that first, then try this!   I have insanely sensitive, dry, rosacea-prone and hormonal skin. I’ve been using Bellini, Dancing Queen and the Universal shade and all three products beautifully blur pores and manage my oily t-zone throughout the day.

I applied the blush quite intense and no bronzer so you can see the shade. In one picture I have applied it also as lipstick (disregard the messy application, is to see the color) PROS: - Hello pigment: this is such a pigmented formula! A little goes a long way so it will last forever. - Creamy and silky texture. It has a very pleasant texture, so silky! - Soft matte finish that looks so natural. - It feels hydrating on the skin - Super long lasting: it lasted like just applied the entire day. - So versatile: you can use it as blush and as a gorgeous lipstick. I haven’t used it as eyeshadow but it may not even crease because it looked perfect on the lips. - Gorgeous packaging: both the cardboard box it came in and the plastic package look so beautiful and they allow to easily see which is the shade.  - It has great price for the amount of product and its quality.  CONS: - I haven’t found any! I am sharing my honest and authentic opinion as a Sephora Beauty Insider Community Ambassador"

It’s a true matte but my skin is a bit oily so it’s kind of satin for me.   My top cream / liquid formulas at the moment are: rare beauty blush, nars multiple stick in Maui and this yummy skin blush. I also love the yummy skin balm powder in shades 3 & 4 and am holding myself back from getting universal one. These products hold up on my oily skin over spf and all that skincare goodness and in the heat, no melting."

I bought dancing Queen because I wanted a bold purpleish blush but it ended up being more red, like a maroon color, and on fair skin, I ended up looking like a clown. It didn’t blend out enough to make it work. So basically, nice formula, but be careful with the colors and swatch them in store, dancing Queen is much more red then it looks online so I would imagine a lot of the other colors run very warm as well."

I got the soft terracotta shade Jubilee, and I honestly feel like it is the perfect amount of pigment. You can build it up for a punch of color on the cheeks, but don’t be intimidated thinking the pigment is too much— it does blend out! I’m pretty pale, and I can easily sheer out the color so it doesn’t look ridiculous on me. Because of the versatility of the pigment level, I feel like the formula truly can work for many skin tones. My only issue so far is that the blush can look patchy on my skin. I have to carefully place and blend the blush for it to not get patchy. I wish it’d be a little more effortless to work with, but maybe I haven’t figured out the best application method yet!"

The Yummy Skin Blurring Balm Flushed is a wonderful kit addition, it’s light weight but buildable so getting your desired color pay out is pretty easy, and the blurring effect it provides is a genius touch in addition to it giving a matte finish which is my preference. It also gives an effortless flush of color to the cheeks & of course like most of her gems can be used multiple ways even on the lips. I opted for this shade because it’s warmer & gives me kind of a bronzy build that I can use alone or with other products I layer  It’s soft but gives that photo finished pop of color that we all love. This is something I’ll keep in my kit, because it certainly will be utilized!"

My first time using it I applied too much and I quickly learned that less is more with this product. This blush lasts a very long time and doesn’t budge. The matte finish is great and looks natural.

I did attempt to apply on my lips but not sure if my lips are just dry they made them drier and the color wore off quickly but the color pay off is still worth it! Also how long it wore for a cream!  Great for an everyday color. I did receive this product as a gift complimentary from danessa myricks but my review is honest."

What’s innovative of this product is the texture although it applies balmy/creamy after drydown it has a matte finish.

It has a balmy texture that turns a bit melty and then sets down to a matte powder finish. Once applied to the cheeks they blend quite nicely but when they set they set so I would recommend working one cheek at a time. Because these set down to that blurred powder finish, the lasting power is incredible. They last all day giving you a flushed, blurred and beautiful cheek. They are also extremely pigmented so start small and add intensity as you like. I love the brightness and vibrancy of the colors and would love to see a shade expansion for more muted dusty shades as well since the formula is fantastic. They also look and wear really nicely on the lips. Overall a great versatile product that can be worn for a gorgeous monochromatic look!"

You can apply this with a brush, fingers or a sponge my preferred method is to tap on with my fingers and then blend it out with a brush.

			"review_text": "This product was gifted by Danessa Myricks Beauty.   I received the new Yummy Skin Blurring Balm Powder Flushed in the shade Primadonna. The Primadonna shade is a hot pink color that looks intimidating in the pan, but easily blends out for a natural flush.   This is meant to be used on both cheeks and lips, but for me it will remain a cheek product. This has to be the most unusual in a good way cream blush I have ever tried. They call it a balm instead of cream, and after trying it I understand why. It literally felt like a lip balm when initially applied. But it quickly dries down and lasts.   My one word of warning is that these blushes are highly pigmented, and thats great. While they do blend out, if you have lighter skin you might want to go in with a light hand. And be careful about putting it on bare skin. At least with the shade I tried, I noticed a tendency to stain.   I will absolutely be trying some of the other shades."

It is very pigmented but easy to control and build so you can have it as intense or as soft as you want! You can use either a brush or your finger, either way you will get a gorgeous soft matte finish. When applied on the cheeks it does not lift makeup and is very easy to blend. On the lips it is lightweight and feels comfortable; no dryness or stickiness. You can even add gloss on top if you want! Very beautiful product and I can't wait to see what comes next!"

You can easily just tap your finger into the balm and start tapping it onto your skin and it blends seamlessly! It looks really fresh and glowing on the skin. The balm really just adapts to the texture of your base underneath. So, if you want it more matte, just apply it over a matte base. It will still offer a natural glow or the skin but not look as dewy. This is such a luscious and luxurious formula! I’m totally obsessed with it! I’d love to see more shades in this blush formula!

You need a teeny amount - like a dot on a fingertip - & it blends SO beautifully and looks so natural! I love it SO MUCH, and what’s more, this Rose & Brunch shade works with BOTH cool and warm-toned looks! It has just the right balance of pink & brown so that either is pulled forward depending on your skin tone & what other colors you’re wearing that day. LOVE LOVE LOVE!!! Also, don’t be confused by the “matte finish” description - this does not look dry or powdery, just natural but not shiny."

I was able to make it work by using a very light hand as the formula is extremely pigmented. I’ve also found that it’s really really pretty as an eyeshadow! I am tempted to try out a lighter shade that would work better for my skin tone."

As someone who has yet to own a product that works so well for blush, I was very excited to try this. I want to start this off by saying, if you like the Blurring balm powder you will LOVE THIS. Because the product is so pigmented, I have found myself at times sheering out the product when I want a natural flush. To use this, I generally rub my fingers directly into the product and lightly tap in onto my cheeks. You can use a brush but for some reason I like finger application best. Don't be mistaken though. This isn't just a blush. It's good for the eyes, nose, and even lips."

I tried the shade Rosé and Brunch and it really complimented my skin tone. It has a matte finish and is blendable but the product dries down pretty quickly. When I apply a bit too much product, I’d like to lightly go over it with a bit of foundation over the top to help melt the products together and have a more natural appearance. I really like how i can go in with a blush brush since it has a wide opening but also like how I can simply use my fingers to apply the product."

In the photo I'm wearing golden hour all over the apples of the cheeks, and I actually had to go over it with my foundation brush to tone it down just a little because it was that intense. The formula is smooth, super buildable, doesn't crease or apply unevenly over many different base products. I would recommend picking one shade that you really like and sticking with that one!"

The shade Bellini is probably my favorite at the moment of the 3 shades I’ve tried (also Primadonna + Dancing Queen are stunning!). Bellini is a perfect shade for every single look and color story in my opinion. My favorite method of applying these is by tapping them into the skin with my fingers because it really melts and becomes one with the skin. I also enjoy using Danessa’s microfiber sponges or the Elf  stipple brush for application to the cheeks. No matter what method you choose the pigment lasts all day and it feels weightless on the skin. For wearing these on the lips you can tap them on for a more blotted flush or build it up for a fully opaque matte finish. It’s super comfortable on the lips since it blurs but is super thin + has great lasting power. Balm Powder Flushes has very quickly become a staple in my makeup routine because of how versatile every shade is across all skin tones + with how incredible the formula is."

The packaging says to apply with fingers, which does work but I found using a blush brush helped give me a more subtle color. I think I may have used too much on my cheeks the first time and it looked blotchy. My second use with a brush was so much softer and more natural looking. When applying to my lips, I liked using a lip brush to make cleaner and more precise lines around my lip. The color is buildable. I tried the primadonna color - which is a little bright and probably more appropriate for the summer or nights out. I’d probably opt for a softer rose for everyday use. For reference, I’ve shared a photo. I’m only wearing a little foundation and the blurring balm powder on my lips and cheeks."

Picked up the orange shade called Golden Hour, as it looks to be a red toned orange and it looks absolutely beautiful on my pink/red skin. Was able to build it up after the first layer 'set' which didn't take long, maybe 30 seconds. It's all the benefits of applying a cream blush that feels and looks like a powder blush when wearing. I wore it for 11 hours, part of that time was wearing a face mask, took a 30 minute walk in the rain where my face/makeup got soaked and it still looked amazing. The only thing that made it come off my face was rubbing it with a cloth or with my cleanser/makeup remover. Am definitely interested in picking up another shade of this and would highly recommend."

I prefer to build up the intensity so I swirl just the tip of my beauty blender in the component to pick up just a tiny amount of the blush. Then I press it onto my cheeks and tap it out using my sponge. I prefer to use my sponge versus a brush for this product.

This is long lasting , highly pigmented and beautiful . Don’t let the daring shades scare you off though because you can really go in sparingly and build up the preferred saturation you want with any shade . Finish wise you get a really lovely skin like result that’s not fully matte which I do appreciate ."
