I have it in Rosu00e9 N Brunch, Dancing Queen, Jubilee, Red Velvet and Spiced Latte. I now use powder blushes only to set THIS. Not that it needs setting, with the matte powder-like finish that nothing sticks to. Note that this is INSANELY pigmented, so I have to apply with a dual-fiber stippling brush (not fingertips), I barely touch the pot with my brush and I immediately start blending. Truly a great product, I can see why it won Allure Best of Beauty."

The texture is unlike that of any other product I've ever used. It's creamy, but it dries down to a soft, matte, almost powdery but still creamy finish. Again, so different, but so fantastic. On both lips and cheeks it's not drying, and feels beautiful on.   I ADORE the soft, diffused finish of it. I mean, look at the photo! Bold, but still soft. There's no harsh lines, just the softly blushed color you're very likely to see on someone in a John Singer Sargent painting.  This is, hands down, my absolute FAVORITE new product! ud83dudc90ud83dudda4"

First off, the formula is quiet innovative and impressive and I think DM is doing amazing things for the makeup space. The shade is beautiful and color payoff is great as well. But my issue with this blush is the same as the blurring balm powder. If you oily skin then this technology can work really well, but if you struggle with DEHYDRATED skin in addition to being oily, then this product may not be for you. Because it is so mattifying and blurring, it clung to my texture and pores, and ended up being super patchy and hard to blend in. Unfortunately, this was a disappointment, but I do still think Danessa is doing amazing work and creating products that arenu2019t just copy and paste from other brand formulas."

            "review_text": "I am 43 & do not wear makeup often, but when I do, I just love a peachy cheek to give my light skin some color & accentuate my baby blues. I always avoid cream blushes because I have VERY oily skin, some redness/acne scarring & large pores, for they always add more unwanted oil/shine, & accentuate pores, YUCKY. My go-to tarte clay blush ran out months ago, so when I recently came on my Sephora app to get more, I opted to look at other options before purchasing. I came across this Yummy Skin Blurring Balm Blush from DANESSA MYRICKS BEAUTY, which is a newer cosmetic company I have never heard. Although it is a cream formula, after reading all the promising wonderful things this does, such as oil reducing, mattifying, & actually blurring pores & fine lines (not just filling in), I skeptically decided to give this a try. Due to my light skin tone & other features, I went w/Bellini, a poppy golden peach.  Ladies, especially my 40+ mature oily skin crew, this cream to matte POWERHOUSE of a blush ACTUALLY does EVERYTHING it says it does, & BEYOND! Not only does it glide on smooth, it actually blurs pores instead of filling & accentuating them, & finishes to a soft, non-cakey matte w/long lasting GORGEOUS color.    I definitely found my new go-to blush (bye tarte, it's been a decent 6 years). If you're not sure what shade to get, they even have a chart that recommends shades for your skin tone range w/modeled images. BRAVO DMB, BRAVO! I now have to check out their other products, for if they work as wonderfully promised as this does, you have me sold.   In my picture, snapped 4 hours AFTER application & WITHOUT photoshop, I prepped w/my usual toner(Claudaile works MAGIC) & moisturizer(MUDMASKY Serum Moisturizer), then MILK Pore Eclipse Mattifying Primer & Laura Mercier Tinted Oil-Free Skin Perfector Moisturizer before applying blush. Oh, & brows by REFY Palmade, filling in my scarce, thin brows beautifully.  DO NOT HESITATE, BUY THIS MAGIC-IN-A-BLUSH NOW!"

I apply high on my cheeks with a stippling brush because a little goes a long way and as an older makeup enthusiast I am always cognizant of the risk of a Mommie Dearest look.    I also use this as a lip product and it is lighter and sheerer than the pigments in the tube so I generally wear it sheered out alone.  I only wish there was a cool rose toned option with intensity midway between this and Dancing Queen."

After reading what other people are saying, I agree that this project is absolutely incredible IF you are bringing your skincare routine A-game to the party. I absolutely LOVE it, but I can see how this product could highlight flaky, dry skin on those who choose to ignore a good skincare routine. So do that first, then try this!   I have insanely sensitive, dry, rosacea-prone and hormonal skin. Iu2019ve been using Bellini, Dancing Queen and the Universal shade and all three products beautifully blur pores and manage my oily t-zone throughout the day. I use the colours on my cheeks and lips, and the universal on my t-zone, chin and forehead. No reaction, no BS and no concealer - see for yourself.   Totally recommend if you incorporate high-quality, regular exfoliation and a proper moisturizer."

I am not disappointed at all! For reference, I am in my mid 40s, have fine lines and wrinkles, enlarged pores and hyperpigmentation. I have normal to dry skin in winter, normal to combo in summer. I applied the blush quite intense and no bronzer so you can see the shade. In one picture I have applied it also as lipstick (disregard the messy application, is to see the color) PROS: - Hello pigment: this is such a pigmented formula! A little goes a long way so it will last forever. - Creamy and silky texture. It has a very pleasant texture, so silky! - Soft matte finish that looks so natural. - It feels hydrating on the skin - Super long lasting: it lasted like just applied the entire day. - So versatile: you can use it as blush and as a gorgeous lipstick. I havenu2019t used it as eyeshadow but it may not even crease because it looked perfect on the lips. - Gorgeous packaging: both the cardboard box it came in and the plastic package look so beautiful and they allow to easily see which is the shade.  - It has great price for the amount of product and its quality.  CONS: - I havenu2019t found any! I am sharing my honest and authentic opinion as a Sephora Beauty Insider Community Ambassador"

Itu2019s a true matte but my skin is a bit oily so itu2019s kind of satin for me.   My top cream / liquid formulas at the moment are: rare beauty blush, nars multiple stick in Maui and this yummy skin blush. I also love the yummy skin balm powder in shades 3 & 4 and am holding myself back from getting universal one. These products hold up on my oily skin over spf and all that skincare goodness and in the heat, no melting."

I apply it with my fingertips for more control and precise placement, since the brush can pick up too much product, but if applied under foundation, I can get away with using the brush since the foundation dilutes the color down. I was pleasantly surprised to find that it has matte finish; more often than not cream products can leave an oily finish, but this is not the case for these blushes. They last long on the skin too. All in all, a great product. Complimentary from Danessa Myricks Beauty in exchange for an honest review."

Iu2019m pretty pale, and I can easily sheer out the color so it doesnu2019t look ridiculous on me. Because of the versatility of the pigment level, I feel like the formula truly can work for many skin tones. My only issue so far is that the blush can look patchy on my skin. I have to carefully place and blend the blush for it to not get patchy. I wish itu2019d be a little more effortless to work with, but maybe I havenu2019t figured out the best application method yet!"

The Yummy Skin Blurring Balm Flushed is a wonderful kit addition, itu2019s light weight but buildable so getting your desired color pay out is pretty easy, and the blurring effect it provides is a genius touch in addition to it giving a matte finish which is my preference. It also gives an effortless flush of color to the cheeks & of course like most of her gems can be used multiple ways even on the lips. I opted for this shade because itu2019s warmer & gives me kind of a bronzy build that I can use alone or with other products I layer  Itu2019s soft but gives that photo finished pop of color that we all love. This is something Iu2019ll keep in my kit, because it certainly will be utilized!"

You just need the smallest amount. I recommend using your finger to initially tap the pigment on, and then using a clean brush to blend it out. The formula is quite nice, as it is a balm so it is easy to pick up on your finger, and then it blends onto the skin very matte. If you are looking for a long lasting blush, this is it! I am giving 4 stars since it was a bit challenging to work with because it is overly pigmented and I had to remove my base twice before actually figuring it out.

I used a damp beauty sponge and lightly dabbed, absolutely start where you want the most pigment. Not a bad idea to dab on back of hand first. Once you figure out what works for you it's gorgeous.

It has a balmy texture that turns a bit melty and then sets down to a matte powder finish. Once applied to the cheeks they blend quite nicely but when they set they set so I would recommend working one cheek at a time. Because these set down to that blurred powder finish, the lasting power is incredible. They last all day giving you a flushed, blurred and beautiful cheek. They are also extremely pigmented so start small and add intensity as you like. I love the brightness and vibrancy of the colors and would love to see a shade expansion for more muted dusty shades as well since the formula is fantastic. They also look and wear really nicely on the lips. Overall a great versatile product that can be worn for a gorgeous monochromatic look!"

It's definitely a balm that melts upon contact with the warmth of my fingers. I apply it with clean fingers directly from the packaging even though it's not the most hygienic way but it's my favorite way. It is a super lightweight formula that glides on effortlessly. I just have to do very light taps on my cheeks and I'm done. It is easily blendable and doesn't separate my foundation underneath. The pigment is so long lasting, too! A little goes a long way in terms of color and product. The packaging isn't heavy or luxe feeling but the product inside definetely is. It's a beautiful blush and formula, and the prize is well worth it!"

The Primadonna shade is a hot pink color that looks intimidating in the pan, but easily blends out for a natural flush.   This is meant to be used on both cheeks and lips, but for me it will remain a cheek product. This has to be the most unusual in a good way cream blush I have ever tried. They call it a balm instead of cream, and after trying it I understand why. It literally felt like a lip balm when initially applied. But it quickly dries down and lasts.   My one word of warning is that these blushes are highly pigmented, and thats great. While they do blend out, if you have lighter skin you might want to go in with a light hand. And be careful about putting it on bare skin. At least with the shade I tried, I noticed a tendency to stain.   I will absolutely be trying some of the other shades."

You can use either a brush or your finger, either way you will get a gorgeous soft matte finish. When applied on the cheeks it does not lift makeup and is very easy to blend. On the lips it is lightweight and feels comfortable; no dryness or stickiness. You can even add gloss on top if you want! Very beautiful product and I can't wait to see what comes next!"

I am really blown away by these shades. I am light-medium skinned with a yellow undertone and this blush really makes my cheeks pop! I haven't loved a blush so much in probably 10 years."

You can easily just tap your finger into the balm and start tapping it onto your skin and it blends seamlessly! It looks really fresh and glowing on the skin. The balm really just adapts to the texture of your base underneath. So, if you want it more matte, just apply it over a matte base. It will still offer a natural glow or the skin but not look as dewy. This is such a luscious and luxurious formula! Iu2019m totally obsessed with it!

It has just the right balance of pink & brown so that either is pulled forward depending on your skin tone & what other colors youu2019re wearing that day. LOVE LOVE LOVE!!!

I like to use my fingers to pick up some product and warm it up a bit on the back of my hand, then I take my fluffy blush brush and blend the product onto the cheeks and the results are stunning. The color pay off is absolutely amazing so using this technique work great for me. I also love how beautiful the blurring effect is. My cheeks never looked this good! Another great tip is you can apply a bit of powder foundation with a fluffy brush after using the blurring balm to soften the look of the blush a bit more."

Because the product is so pigmented, I have found myself at times sheering out the product when I want a natural flush. To use this, I generally rub my fingers directly into the product and lightly tap in onto my cheeks. You can use a brush but for some reason I like finger application best. Don't be mistaken though.

I apply it like i would a cream, with my fingers or a brush.  It is very pigmented so a little goes a long way.  You tend to get some skin peeking through so it looks pretty natural.  After applied it's not really greasy and it sets down almost to a satin powder. I like this but I don't know if I would repurchase because it performs like a lot of other cream products."

I literally feel like coming back to my face once I start applying blush. I simply cannot go without it, and even on the odd day where I donu2019t wear makeup, I still apply some blush. I tried the shade Rosu00e9 and Brunch and it really complimented my skin tone. It has a matte finish and is blendable but the product dries down pretty quickly. When I apply a bit too much product, Iu2019d like to lightly go over it with a bit of foundation over the top to help melt the products together and have a more natural appearance. I really like how i can go in with a blush brush since it has a wide opening but also like how I can simply use my fingers to apply the product."

The shade Bellini is probably my favorite at the moment of the 3 shades Iu2019ve tried (also Primadonna + Dancing Queen are stunning!). Bellini is a perfect shade for every single look and color story in my opinion. My favorite method of applying these is by tapping them into the skin with my fingers because it really melts and becomes one with the skin. I also enjoy using Danessau2019s microfiber sponges or the Elf  stipple brush for application to the cheeks. No matter what method you choose the pigment lasts all day and it feels weightless on the skin. For wearing these on the lips you can tap them on for a more blotted flush or build it up for a fully opaque matte finish. Itu2019s super comfortable on the lips since it blurs but is super thin + has great lasting power. Balm Powder Flushes has very quickly become a staple in my makeup routine because of how versatile every shade is across all skin tones + with how incredible the formula is."

The packaging says to apply with fingers, which does work but I found using a blush brush helped give me a more subtle color. I think I may have used too much on my cheeks the first time and it looked blotchy. My second use with a brush was so much softer and more natural looking. When applying to my lips, I liked using a lip brush to make cleaner and more precise lines around my lip. The color is buildable. I tried the primadonna color - which is a little bright and probably more appropriate for the summer or nights out. Iu2019d probably opt for a softer rose for everyday use. For reference, Iu2019ve shared a photo. Iu2019m only wearing a little foundation and the blurring balm powder on my lips and cheeks."

After a few minutes I could tell what and where I need to improve. Because if you rub too much you wipe the product off partially.

I can't feel it on my cheeks, itu2019s very lightweight and dries to a sort of powder. I also use it on my lips and top it off with gloss at times.  Canu2019t wait to get more colors!

It's a relatively new innovative ingredient that keeps oily skin controlled, without a powdery/makeup-ey look. I have extremely dry skin and this is my first product that I've tried with upsalite. And wow I love it. It blurs the skin, makes texture look incredible, and evenly applies the color. It's fantastic, never patchy, creamy to the touch, and very unique. I will say if you have Fair-light skin go in with a light hand as this product builds a lot. There's quite a bit of pigment. It's even beautiful tapped onto the lips!"

If i want more pigment, I can add it, making me suspect this would work on all skin tones.  Additionally, I cannot believe it but this does seem to have a gentle blurring effect? It is VERY flattering on my skin, which is amazing as I have dry skin. This is the only blush I've worn since I received it and let me tell you...that is saying a lot with my huge collection.

Picked up the orange shade called Golden Hour, as it looks to be a red toned orange and it looks absolutely beautiful on my pink/red skin. Was able to build it up after the first layer 'set' which didn't take long, maybe 30 seconds. It's all the benefits of applying a cream blush that feels and looks like a powder blush when wearing. I wore it for 11 hours, part of that time was wearing a face mask, took a 30 minute walk in the rain where my face/makeup got soaked and it still looked amazing. The only thing that made it come off my face was rubbing it with a cloth or with my cleanser/makeup remover. Am definitely interested in picking up another shade of this and would highly recommend."

It's not sticky at all, balm like and dries down to a beautiful powder finish. It sits well on top of makeup without ruining your makeup.

The description is accurate in that it is the perfect tone for my fair skin! It's a beautiful cream texture that glides onto my cheeks effortlessly. I prefer to build up the intensity so I swirl just the tip of my beauty blender in the component to pick up just a tiny amount of the blush. Then I press it onto my cheeks and tap it out using my sponge. I prefer to use my sponge versus a brush for this product. I've found it easier to attain a more flawless airbrushed look using the blender vs a brush. The color is lucious and dewy and it lasts on my cheeks all day long."

I really like the color, it's like a very flattering peachy coral that can make a statement on its own. I kept my makeup minimal and let the blush be the bright color accent. It has good staying power and I noticed very minimal fading at the end of the day, maybe a little bit but the blush was definitely still there.
