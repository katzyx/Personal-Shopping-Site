Formula is so creamy and blendable, even more so than Rare Beauty or Fenty in my opinion. 4 stars because the shape is a little awkward for nose contouring. I apply directly onto my skin when I want full-glam, or I apply it first to a brush if I'm going for a softer look. It's actually so creamy/dewy that I need set my face with powder bronzer, but I'd rather do this than have a patchy application. I have the shade Harmony for a true bronzed look."

The lightest color would be the only other color that would be close but it is too light. So I need a color in between. 2. It broke me out on my forehead where I applied it after 1 day of use.

I'm a fairly pale girly, but this gives me the perfect amount of color without that orange or over the top bronzed appearance.  The only complaint I have (and this is more of a user error) is that you have to be very careful when placing the lid back on. I accidentally scraped a chunk off the side because I didn't properly align the corners of the triangle. This is a super soft formula, so just be aware of that and you're all set!"

Now as far as the product itself is concerned, I do not get the hype whatsoever. This is hard to blend and very blotchy.

Iu2019ve tried other sticks and I can safely say this one is the creamiest Iu2019ve tried. Because this shade is a bit dark for me I build the color up so it can match my skin tone. It does blend out well but when you add product on top it does get quite patchy. The undertone is also very orange. I think the formula is decent but the color could be less orange.

For application, I recommend swipe a little onto the back of your hand, stipple and blend a little onto your brush and apply into contours of your cheek or wherever you'd like contouring. It blends smoothly and stays all day. You'll have some time to play with the product because of its creamy texture. It applies evenly and you can also build it up. I am pretty oily so I will still set this with my bronzer in order for it to last 8+ hours without any creasing, oxidation, patchiness, and fading. Amazing price for how much you get. I got two colors because I get dark brown in the summer and light yellow in the winter. These shades don't look orange as most bronzers do on on my Pacific islander skin tone. Lys Beauty is a very underrated makeup line that deserves more hype!!!"

You can keep the product heavily pigmented OR you can keep blending into the skin to sheer it out completely. It has a smooth texture that melts down nicelyu2026 Not too quick but also not too hard to blend. Itu2019s a balanced formula that doesnu2019t require too much work. I recommend for beginners-advanced makeup artists or beauty enthusiasts. My favorite way to apply this product is by swirling a soft but dense cheek brush on top of the product and then applying from the brush to the cheek bones. Itu2019s such an easy formula you can draw straight into the cheeks from the component if you wish."

Itu2019s highly pigmented, a little goes a long way and blends like a dream. Since this product is so pigmented. I love using this under my foundation, that way the color peeks through without being too much. My only con would be the size and shape of the packaging, you could easily apply too much if you apply this straight to your face, I suggest applying on your hand and using a sponge or brush for application."

            "review_text": "I am a light neutral olive, not too pale and not tan enough to be in that category.  I was really glad to see that this bronzer doesnu2019t have any sparkle in it.  Therefore, I use it like a natural sunny contour.  This is a really unique means of application.  Itu2019s a cream, but the kind that doesnu2019t feel all melty.  It turns to a powder finish, but not in the way that it simply sits on top of the skin if you know what I mean.  You can apply it directly from the stick and utilize the tip of the triangle to make sharper lines.  You can also just rub your fingers on it, pat a sponge, or wipe your brush over it.  Surprisingly, I enjoy using a brush!  I typically use my fingers, but using a brush to blend it all out really diffuses the look.  Iu2019m not too used to wearing bronzer and definitely not really used to contouring in the traditional sense, so I thought it was like too orange at first.  Honestly, thatu2019s just me being overly sensitive about seeing the bronze color.  A little goes a long way, so you can really tailor it to your liking.  I absolutely love how it looks on the forehead in particular, looks like a beautiful sunkissed tan look.  I prefer how this looks with a full face if Iu2019m going all over, but I like to use a tiny bit to give some life to my face especially on mornings where I just cannot lol.  I highly recommend this product and the price point is reasonable, as I feel this will last a long time.  Itu2019s very convenient to take around with you since itu2019s not a large pan, pot, what have you.  Itu2019s lightweight but doesnu2019t feel or look cheap.  You can bring it with you for a quick touch up if needed and blend with your fingers.  Very forgiving formula :)"

I would definitely recommend this Bronzer and contouring stick."

Being fair skinned, I always get nervous that bronzers will make me look orange, but the shade Motivate is more neutral and looks natural with my cool undertones.  If you are looking to get a lighter application, I have a few tips.  Angle the stick to produce a thinner line.  Apply the bronzer to the back of your hand and swipe on the face with a brush to better control the amount of product used."

I got the shade light which I usually do in cream bronzers. But this is too light. This shade is intended for someone that has very fair skin. I have light skin and this barely shows up on me. So I tried it on my face anyways and it just looks dirty. Like I got dirt smeared on my cheeks. Itu2019s awful. Itu2019s thick too. But it does blend out very easily. I like that. Iu2019m not sure what to do. Medium looked too dark so I would have to go to Sephora and exchange it. Donu2019t know if itu2019s worth it. I have so many cream bronzers I love. This one just didnu2019t make the cut. Plus it has a really yellow greenish undertone. I didnu2019t enjoy it at all. Ya itu2019s not as expensive as the CT cream bronzer but it was a waste of money in the end because of how bad it turned out to be. Iu2019d say give it a try if your very fair skinned. You might really enjoy. But if you have a pink undertone this probably will look terrible. As it did on me. Sucks because was excited for this one. Unfortunately I did not like this at all. Gave it 2 stars for how well it blends even though itu2019s a thicker formula. Hope this helps!"

I'm really fair skinned and this shade works for the days that I want a more natural look but on the days that I want a chiseled look, I'll be using a darker shade. This is a great product to use when you'll be sweating because it holds up really well. It doesn't lift my Foundation either while applying it. It's a twist up stick but it locks in place after each turn which helps save product. I think the cap has a magnet in it because it doesn't fall off at all but if not it at least snaps in place. The entire thing was designed perfectly. It's another amazing product made by lys! I definitely recommend it."

I'm really pale and a lot of times these make me look orange or like I have dirt on my face. But this is the absolute pert shade for my skin tone. It gives me a beautiful sun kissed glow! It blends out perfectly and is also buildable. So I can have a light subtle look or go dramatic and sexy! It's perfect!! It lasts all day without fading and looks amazing by the end of the night.

All of these methods work for this bronzer!   Harmony is perfect for my light medium skin, and it would probably still work on some shades darker than me. When just looking at it in the tube, I thought it would be too warm on me. However, once it's applied on my face, it ends up being more neutral, which I prefer.
