Formula is so creamy and blendable, even more so than Rare Beauty or Fenty in my opinion. 4 stars because the shape is a little awkward for nose contouring. I apply directly onto my skin when I want full-glam, or I apply it first to a brush if I'm going for a softer look. It's actually so creamy/dewy that I need set my face with powder bronzer, but I'd rather do this than have a patchy application. I have the shade Harmony for a true bronzed look."

I do think it blends well, but I will have to return it for 2 reasons: 1. The color I purchased that would work best for my skin tone is too warm/orangy. I need the color to be a little more cool. The lightest color would be the only other color that would be close but it is too light. So I need a color in between. 2. It broke me out on my forehead where I applied it after 1 day of use.   All in all, I don't think its a bad product, its just not for my skin type or skin tone."

I find the shades to be really good colour's too! I usually can't find good bronzer products for my undertone. After some time though, mine lost it's gliding trait and became hard to blend, but I think it mightve been a storage issue (I usually had it in a colder dry room) so I would watch out for that if you live in a colder dryer climate!!!"

It blends beautifully  3. The shape allows me to make controlled and consistent lines (especially important for nose contouring) 4. The color is beautiful. I'm a fairly pale girly, but this gives me the perfect amount of color without that orange or over the top bronzed appearance.  The only complaint I have (and this is more of a user error) is that you have to be very careful when placing the lid back on. I accidentally scraped a chunk off the side because I didn't properly align the corners of the triangle. This is a super soft formula, so just be aware of that and you're all set!"

I‚Äôm a deeper medium skin tone, so I fingered I‚Äôd just keep Harmony and give it a shot.  First of all, this is NOT a contour! It‚Äôs beyond WARM! Not sure why they even call them contour sticks because the majority of their color range is warm tones. Makes no sense to me. Now as far as the product itself is concerned, I do not get the hype whatsoever. This is hard to blend and very blotchy. No matter what I blend it with and what I‚Äôm wearing under it, it‚Äôs ALWAYS hard to blend out and blotchy. Of all the bronzers and contours I‚Äôve tried, and I‚Äôve tried way too many, this is my least favorite."

I‚Äôve tried other sticks and I can safely say this one is the creamiest I‚Äôve tried. Because this shade is a bit dark for me I build the color up so it can match my skin tone. It does blend out well but when you add product on top it does get quite patchy. The undertone is also very orange. I think the formula is decent but the color could be less orange.

It blends smoothly and stays all day. You'll have some time to play with the product because of its creamy texture. It applies evenly and you can also build it up. I am pretty oily so I will still set this with my bronzer in order for it to last 8+ hours without any creasing, oxidation, patchiness, and fading. Amazing price for how much you get. I got two colors because I get dark brown in the summer and light yellow in the winter. These shades don't look orange as most bronzers do on on my Pacific islander skin tone.

You can keep the product heavily pigmented OR you can keep blending into the skin to sheer it out completely. It has a smooth texture that melts down nicely‚Ä¶ Not too quick but also not too hard to blend. It‚Äôs a balanced formula that doesn‚Äôt require too much work. I recommend for beginners-advanced makeup artists or beauty enthusiasts. My favorite way to apply this product is by swirling a soft but dense cheek brush on top of the product and then applying from the brush to the cheek bones. It‚Äôs such an easy formula you can draw straight into the cheeks from the component if you wish."

Therefore, I use it like a natural sunny contour.  This is a really unique means of application.  It‚Äôs a cream, but the kind that doesn‚Äôt feel all melty.  It turns to a powder finish, but not in the way that it simply sits on top of the skin if you know what I mean.  You can apply it directly from the stick and utilize the tip of the triangle to make sharper lines.  You can also just rub your fingers on it, pat a sponge, or wipe your brush over it.  Surprisingly, I enjoy using a brush!  I typically use my fingers, but using a brush to blend it all out really diffuses the look.  I‚Äôm not too used to wearing bronzer and definitely not really used to contouring in the traditional sense, so I thought it was like too orange at first.  Honestly, that‚Äôs just me being overly sensitive about seeing the bronze color.  A little goes a long way, so you can really tailor it to your liking.  I absolutely love how it looks on the forehead in particular, looks like a beautiful sunkissed tan look.  I prefer how this looks with a full face if I‚Äôm going all over, but I like to use a tiny bit to give some life to my face especially on mornings where I just cannot lol.  I highly recommend this product and the price point is reasonable, as I feel this will last a long time.  It‚Äôs very convenient to take around with you since it‚Äôs not a large pan, pot, what have you.  It‚Äôs lightweight but doesn‚Äôt feel or look cheap.  You can bring it with you for a quick touch up if needed and blend with your fingers.  Very forgiving formula :)"

This creamy Bronzer stick comes in the trademark LYS triangle shape which lends itself wonderfully to bronzing and contouring. I can apply with a brush or directly to my face using the edges and tip for more precise contouring and the broad side for bronzing along my cheeks and forehead. The formula feels super creamy and blendable while applying and has a lightweight satiny finish. The shade was easy to match and works well with my skin tone. I would definitely recommend this Bronzer and contouring stick."

Being fair skinned, I always get nervous that bronzers will make me look orange, but the shade Motivate is more neutral and looks natural with my cool undertones.  If you are looking to get a lighter application, I have a few tips.  Angle the stick to produce a thinner line.  Apply the bronzer to the back of your hand and swipe on the face with a brush to better control the amount of product used."

I got the shade light which I usually do in cream bronzers. But this is too light. This shade is intended for someone that has very fair skin. I have light skin and this barely shows up on me. So I tried it on my face anyways and it just looks dirty. Like I got dirt smeared on my cheeks. It‚Äôs awful. It‚Äôs thick too. But it does blend out very easily. I like that. I‚Äôm not sure what to do. Medium looked too dark so I would have to go to Sephora and exchange it. Don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs worth it. I have so many cream bronzers I love. This one just didn‚Äôt make the cut. Plus it has a really yellow greenish undertone. I didn‚Äôt enjoy it at all. Ya it‚Äôs not as expensive as the CT cream bronzer but it was a waste of money in the end because of how bad it turned out to be. I‚Äôd say give it a try if your very fair skinned. You might really enjoy. But if you have a pink undertone this probably will look terrible. As it did on me. Sucks because was excited for this one. Unfortunately I did not like this at all. Gave it 2 stars for how well it blends even though it‚Äôs a thicker formula. Hope this helps!"

It glides so smoothly every time! The shape of it is perfect for sculpting. I get the perfect sharp contour every time. It being a triangle makes it perfect for my face. I can use it flat to glide perfectly across my cheeks and jaw line, then use the points to sculpt my nose without using too much. I'm really pale and a lot of times these make me look orange or like I have dirt on my face. But this is the absolute pert shade for my skin tone. It gives me a beautiful sun kissed glow! It blends out perfectly and is also buildable. So I can have a light subtle look or go dramatic and sexy! It's perfect!! It lasts all day without fading and looks amazing by the end of the night. I almost never want to take it off. But when I need to, it comes off easily and leaves my skin feeling better than before. It's seriously the perfect product! I cannot wait to get more shades!"

I've tested it many different ways: applying the stick directly to my face, blending with a sponge, blending with a brush, picking up product with a brush first. All of these methods work for this bronzer!   Harmony is perfect for my light medium skin, and it would probably still work on some shades darker than me. When just looking at it in the tube, I thought it would be too warm on me. However, once it's applied on my face, it ends up being more neutral, which I prefer.   I am super happy with the longevity of this cream bronzer as well! Even though I have been getting oilier during the summer, this has lasted on me all day."
