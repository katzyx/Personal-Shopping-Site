	"how_to_use": "Suggested Usage:.-Build your base with the matte powder shadows. .-Pick up metallics and cream shimmers using a brush in small circular motions. .-Apply on lids for an illuminating finish. .-Build an extra layer using your fingers or a sponge brush for a high-shine foil effect. .-For a soft pearlescent glow, apply the pearl gloss hybrid to bare lids using your finger or a flat brush...Huda‚Äôs Hacks:.-For deeper shades, blend is your friend. Brushes are super important to get a smooth finish in the crease and across the lid. .-Not all deep shades have to be bold and graphic. Blend out the deep mattes with a fluffy brush to give definition and shape to the eyes without overtaking the entire makeup look. .-For soft daytime looks, build a light base using matte shades, adding shimmer across the lid using your finger, a flat brush, or a sponge applicator. .-The metallics and pearl gloss hybrid can also be used to contour the lower lash line. Add to inner corners for a soft highlight to keep eyes looking big and bright.",

The ‚Äúcream marble‚Äù shadows are exquisite and some of my favs ever.  I use ‚ÄòMoon Magic‚Äô and ‚ÄòSelf Love‚Äô for my inner-corners and always get compliments!  I don‚Äôt use the glossy one ‚ÄòLove Stone‚Äô as much as I should and even after this time it hasn‚Äôt dried out!  Honestly my favourite palette I own <3xo"
