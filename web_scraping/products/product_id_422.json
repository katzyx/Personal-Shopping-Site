I have thick and crazy hair and anything other than one, even a chi has always taken so long to straighten that I had given up on the whole idea when my babybliss straightener got lost in a move. I've tried so many others and literally want to cry. I hear amazing things about this straightener although to be honest I haven't personally tried it. I'm begging sephora to please gift me one, a straightener of any kind that's similar in quality to the babybliss. I'll write u reviews forever on any and everything for the chance to be gifted  one.  My life has seriously been depressing and my style and self esteem has become non-existence without my straight hair to make me feel beautiful.  I'm begging u to plz plz help me feel like me again with this one item. I can't afford 300 bucks to spend on one to have it not work how I want It or need it to.  Send me the bill I'll pay it if it delivers results.  Thanks so much for reading this xoxo"

Some products I have notice (especially straighter) do not have that capability, but this straighter does! I also love how fast it takes to heat up! Especially since I am on a time crunch, it definitely helps. Lastly, I just love how fast it straightens my hair. For reference, my hair is coarse, frizzy, and slightly wavy. Because of that, I have a difficult time with finding a product that glides through my hair smoothly - this straighter doesn’t have that issue. No pulls, makes my hair smoothly fast and efficiently! Highly recommend 🥰 complimentary from Drybar but my 100% honest impressions."

Ok done. Sent the flat iron back to them and waited almost 3 weeks for the new one. Had this new iron for 8 months, it started making a sizzling noise and smelled really bad! Broke again. One of the plates did not get hot. I sent in my iron 16 days ago and it is going to take a week for me to get a new one… another 3 week process. Don’t bother buying this iron.

There is NO reason to straighten your hair at 365 or 425 -- which are the common heat options for single or dual temp straighteners -- if your hair will straighten at lower temps. High heat is horribly damaging to your hair if you don't have thick coarse strands. I set the Tress Press at 220 and it works perfectly for me and doesn't fry my hair. Love this tool."

When I was looking for something with a bit more power to get through my changing hair texture, this flat iron came highly recommended by the Sephora associate. I was hesitant about the cost but had a good experience with some of Drybar's products so I took the plunge. It worked okay for little while. Never fully combated my new texture but it did the job well enough! And then it died. Midway through a full straighten. As I was getting ready for a wedding. 5 months after buying it. Unfortunately, I don't think I'll be repurchasing."

My daughter recently had a blowout at a Drybar salon and her hair looked spectacular! I headed to Sephora to check out the Drybar potions, so to speak, to see which one could help me hold a curl since I could never get or hold  the kind of curls my daughter got for minutes, let alone days, as she had after her blowout. Gina at the Mall of Ga store saw me looking bewildered in front of the Drybar section and came to my rescue. “It’s the tools,” she said. I have to admit I was a bit skeptical and was really not prepared to shell out this much cash for a flat iron when I had a perfectly good one at home. She grabbed a couple of bottles and this iron and led me to the makeover area, sprayed some Hot Toddy over a section of my hair, ironed it, and said “feel your hair.” I could not believe my eyes nor my fingers! My hair was so smooth, shiny, bouncy, soft, and I could feel no product whatsoever in my hair. I was floored! She continued working on my hair and told me that Drybar has videos on you tube for how to make curls using the iron, which is what I had been looking for. A few sprays and strokes of the iron and my hair looked better than I’ve ever seen it! Full, soft, shiny. Who is this anyway staring back at me in the mirror? I headed back to the Drybar display, snatched up an iron and a couple of products at Gina’s recommendation. The next morning, I washed and styled my hair with my new flat iron, curling it at the ends and spritzing with The moneymaker hairspray. Got complements on my hair all day long, even got asked BY A HAIRSTYLIST who does my hair!!! I should mention that I have never been particularly good at styling hair, so this says a lot. I feel like this has opened up a whole new world for me, as I can now have the styles that I’ve admired on other people for so long! Yes, it really is that good. So worth it! Thanks Drybar and Gina!"

As someone who straightens their hair everyday, the Tress Press is quick (straight the first round) and it leaves your hair feeling silky, rather than dry like hay which many other leading straighteners do. I don’t feel guilty straightening my hair anymore because the Tress Press gives me healthy looking and feeling hair. No frizz and no worries of burning your hair off. I recommend this to everyone."

However I used this twice and the paint around the plates already started chipping, a lot! When the devise heats up I noticed the place where the plates are turns a different color yellow, almost a burnt yellow. But once it cools off it goes back to normal. However this was after only two uses, so I’m wondering how long it would take for the color to change permanently. Also it pulled and tugged on my hair, definitely uncomfortable and not a single pass! This also feels cheaply made and not a long term device. Listen to the negative reviews, and buyer beware!"

The biggest no for me was the fact that this is very uncomfortable to use. I honestly think it was starting to give me carpal tunnel symptoms. The barrel is very chunky and slippery and hard to comfortably press the plates together. It also doesn't give me the straight look I'm going for. Since it's curved around the plates and the plates are so small, it would always curl my hair under, not straight. The plates are also very short lengthwise, so you literally have to work with tiny 1 sections each time. For someone with thick hair, that can take forever! It also did not keep my hair straight - my hair would start to curl within an hour or two. For the price and brand, I expected a lot better. The only nice thing about this iron is the vibrant yellow colour. Would not recommend."

I washed my hair today and was too lazy to sit down and blow dry it so I decided to air dry it. Then my door bell rang and my order arrived! Busted this baby out to take it for a test run right away. Took me 15 minutes to straighten my hair (heat to 410F as suggested by the manual) and I got the same results as if I were to blow-dry. Now I have two options: blow-dry (takes 20-30 minutes) or let air dry on lazy days and straighten my hair for the same effect in 10-15 minutes!  I have yet to try to do curls/waves with this but I'm sure it'l turn out pretty good."

When I first straightened my baby hairs that surround my face, they didn't straighten nicely and I found it hard to straighten closer to the root with this straightener; however, with time I got the hang of it.  My mother, who's usually straightened my hair pin straight (when I want to go for that look) told me that it looks a lot like my sister's naturally straight hair the second and third time I straightened my hair. As I continued to use it, just at a temp of about 380-410, the results turned out a lot better.

			"review_text": "Okay, first let me start by mentioning that there are *two* drybar straighteners. The Tress Press digital iron ($150) & the Smooth Operator iron ($125). The Smooth Operator has had several reviews left under the Tress Press review thread & seem to be the handful of negative experiences. This straightener (Tress Press) has adjustable heat & if put on the hottest setting of 450 f, literally reaches the temperature within 5-10 seconds, instant! The plates are titanium & if you have previously used a tool with ceramic, these take some getting used to. The ceramic slides easier for sure, but the titanium w negative ions are much better on your hair (seals cuticle, tames frizz, less damage) & distributes heat more evenly so once you get the groove of the titanium the ease will no longer be a concern. It's like upgrading from a tricycle to a bike, sure one is easier, but the other more functional. Also, the iron automatically shuts off after an hour, & has a generous cord length & even has a memory so it will always turn onto the temperature setting you prefer. If you curl your hair w a straightener, this will keep your curls even longer & wraps easily with little tugging. I even tried straightening my hair after curling a few pieces to see how good it worked & if it could reverse the curl. It actually flattened out completely & looked like I started straightening from the get go! Overall I'm very impressed & so so happy I upgraded from my decade old Chi (which surprising is still going strong). Now I just hope this one has a lifespan the same."

I have the Buttercup and adore it, and while on vacation had to purchase a straightener to touch up before a wedding, so I figured I'd splurge. I have thick, wavy hair that is generally too soft and heavy to hold curls, so straightening is my go-to. I had sprized a small about of Drybar's Triple Sec on the roots of my hair and went at the bottom with this, and just a slight mist of Triple Sec on the bottom hair totally gunked it up set to 400. After heating it up super hot and using a towel to get the gunk off, I turned it back down and tried doing my hair again - and this time, it barely straightened. It creased my hair when I tried to turn it under at the end and it didn't fight my wave at all.  My Chi may be 10+ years old, but it straightens so much more effectively than this iron.

I also noticed that I need to press the on button several times before it turns on. Sometimes it doesn't work at all and I need to unplug it and try again.

The Chi’s I have had in the past haven’t had the option to adjust the heat, which I didn’t really care for because why subject your hair to the high heat when it isn’t needed? Plus, I could have all kinds of volume going on and the Chi would just wipe it out. I can use this on 300 degrees (just got it today, and plan to try it on even lower settings) and it smooths my hair VERY nicely with leaving the volume. Even my husband mentioned how much he likes my hair tonight (and he NEVER notices much change in my hair.  I was extra surprised because I really don't care for drybars styling products, as I feel they make my hair feel gunky and don't really do that much for it  Bonus points that it comes in my favorite color."

I'm still trying to get used to curling with it, as this one tool is replacing my Jilbere straightener and my Hot tools curling iron, both of which I have had since being a freshman in HS. The only reasons I am giving 4 stars is because I think that it's not really worth the 150, it didn't blow me away. Also, it's tough to get used to for curling, and the curls didn't turn out that well. But that may come with time and more getting used to styling with it. I just have to get to know it better. Bottom line, if you are looking for an all-in-one tool, this isn't a bad choice. I imagine it will last for a long time (fingers crossed) and become second nature for me to use."

It takes less time than my previous straightener however I notice my hair doesn't stay straight for as long. Usually I need to touch it up after work or the next day. That being said it's still great. I love that I can customize the temperature and save it so it always heats to that level. It leaves my hair feeling soft each time I use it.

I love that the controls aren't on the handle but in the middle of the straightener so you don't accidentally turn it off while using it.  So far I've only used it to curl/wave my hair - took a bit of getting used to because it's much different in size compared to my old straightener, but it works great! Glides quickly through my hair and leaves it frizz-free, a definite plus because my hair is so thick/coarse generally.  Love this device, for the price you can't go wrong!"
