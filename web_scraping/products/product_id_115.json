I have never had this issue before with any curler before, even much cheaper ones worked. Beware of the BioIonic website as it only posts positive reviews but if you read other platforms, you will see that this is a huge problem for many.

Bc of Sephora’s crappy return policy of 30 days from date of purchase, not date of arrival, I am outside the window to return. My husband ordered it as a gift during  the sale and it took 2 weeks to arrive. Then when he gave it to me, I only had a couple days to try it. I was expecting to love it and did not rush to use it and now I wish I had. It took me a few days of using it to realize how awful it was and I’m stuck with it now. Do not waste your money. I will go back to using my broken T3 bc it is faster and holds curl so much better."

I prefer wavier curls because I like to keep my length, but I never was able to master the twist and drop technique that's really popular right now. I decided to purchase this iron because I saw lots of hair dressers on TikTok using it. This iron achieves that twist and drop look without any effort on my part. I curl my hair like usual! Every curl is smooth and stays for days--and I have pin straight, hard to keep a curl, type hair. If this broke tomorrow, I would place an order immediately. I don't think it compares to any other hot tool out there."

I plugged this in as soon as it was delivered, and I IMMEDIATELY got the results I have been to get for years. This iron is soooo easy to use, and your hair doesn't get pulled at all.

			"review_text": "First off, I've only been using this iron for a few weeks so I can't speak to the longevity of the product. However, what I can say is I am so impressed by my results so far! I have thick, coarse, medium-to-long hair and this makes it so smooth and soft. It glides effortlessly through my hair and my hair doesn't get snagged anywhere or create any unflattering crimps, because the clamp is not too tight and the texture of the plates are so silky. With the long barrel, it would be very hard to get tangles or have hair spill over the end as you curl. So it's very beginner friendly for someone who is not used to a standard curling iron with a clamp. For me personally, all it takes is for the iron to be heated to 390, a little medium hold hairspray to set, and these curls will last for days! Of course on the second day, it goes from a full curl to more of a soft wave.. but that soft wave looks great and lasts a full 3 days. Personally I wash my hair twice a week so I haven't really tested longer than that. I'm sure that as with any iron, results will depend on hair type, technique, and the products you use in conjunction with it. For me I'm very pleased. Overall, I was apprehensive about the price but as long as this iron holds up over time, I think it's a terrific investment."

But when I use cheaper curling irons, (same temperature) the curls will stay for at least 2 days with no touch ups and no hairspray.
