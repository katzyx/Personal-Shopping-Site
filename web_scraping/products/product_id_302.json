	"how_to_use": "- Spritz 1-2 times directly on the pulse points, such as your wrists, inner elbows or sides of the neck. Pulse points are warmer areas of the body that act as natural diffusers when emitting a scent. .- After application, allow the scent to air dry. Rubbing or dabbing will break down a fragrance and cause it to wear off more quickly. .- If you wear fragrance on the wrists, be sure to reapply after frequent hand-washing. .- Properly store your bottle to extend its shelf life, including recapping after each use and avoiding direct sunlight.",

Moisturized well, used an oil base and after around 3-4hours unnoticeable. Granted it is a dabber, but still cannot justify a full size bottle. I loved this fragrance the most (out of 3) because it was unlike any others I have. I have been exploring unisex scents and this reminded me of a Moroccan oil for your hair.  Sucks because I really really really love how neutral the fragrance is. Have thought about the bold version, but the notes seem really different. Overall, it is a great, friendly, and unique fragrance."

The price tag is a bit expensive for the longevity to only be about 4 hours (with 1 spray, I'm sure it'd last longer with more) but the scent is well worth it. It starts warm and powdery with a bright burst of foresty greens from the Juniper Berries. The dry down is the PERFECT creamy, vanilla, amber. This would be amazing to layer with also, I paired it with Kayali 28 and WOW. I have well over 40 perfumes so it's a big thing to say this makes top 5."

This is a scent that I bought on a whim, and I was pleasantly surprised by how much I liked it. It has a rich, warm, and spicy aroma that reminds me of luxury and success. It's not too overpowering, but it definitely makes a statement.  One of the things I loved about Gold Expressive was how it made me feel when I wore it. I felt like I could take on any challenge and conquer any obstacle. I felt like a boss, in the best possible way. I enjoyed lathering myself with it before going to work or meeting friends. It gave me a boost of confidence and charisma that I really appreciated.  However, there was one thing that prevented me from giving Gold Expressive a perfect score. The scent didn't last very long on me. It seemed to fade away after a few hours, leaving me disappointed and wanting more. I wish it had more staying power, because I really liked how it smelled. Maybe it's just my skin chemistry, but I felt like it could have been more durable.  Overall, I think Gold Expressive is a great fragrance for anyone who wants to feel assertive and dominant. It has a wonderful smell that is both sophisticated and sensual. It's not for the faint of heart, but for those who want to make an impression. The only downside is that it doesn't last very long, which is a shame. But if you don't mind reapplying it throughout the day, you might love it as much as I do."

I would describe this as the grown-up, refined version of the Pink Sugar and Juicy perfume group. For the smell, I think skin chemistry plays a bigger role in this frag. On my skin, the initial smell is a musky, woody, slightly sweet scent. Then it dries down and smells like a very sweet vanilla (I think someone mentioned vanilla frosting, which I think is pretty accurate), with a very soft sandalwood in the middle. I think if you're going for a gourmand with some depth this is a perfect option. On my friend it didn't smell as sweet, more cologne-y, but still feminine."

Some define this as a masculine scent. The sandalwood lends itself to that. I have met men who wear similar style colognes. I find the initial scent overly sweet like a vanilla icing, which can be helpful if you are looking for a masking scent. Vanilla sugar is the dominate scent in the profile. There is something about it that makes it atmospheric. Like the lobby of a boutique hotel in Miami Beach or a department store of fine leather shoes. I will wear this occasionally, but the alcohol isn‚Äôt as balanced as I would want."

Bold is very different from the other 2, heavier and with added spices. I personally do not enjoy Bold at all.

I was pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed Gold Expressive on the tester strip, it smelled like a less sickeningly smoky version of By The Fireplace for reference. It smells like a vanilla, baked good in the fall/winter season. However, the projection, village and overall longevity of this fragrance is comically horrendous, and does not merit the price. This fragrance or that of the Personal line would likely be great bedtime fragrances where you can spray it on, feel good, connect with the colder seasons and not be overwhelmed by the scent in bed. This is not a fragrance I'd expect to last more than an hour at any time, so if that is a detriment, which it certainly is for me, then I'd go for a more potent vanilla fragrance. One recommendation I have would be Angelique Noire from Guerlain (significantly more expensive) or Vanillaa Diorama from Dior Privee (Also quite pricey) for the best, long-wearing, stunning vanilla."

It is a warm smell that is pretty sophisticated, kind of uni-sex, but isn't over powering. I feel like it is hard to go overboard with this. It reminds me of an old-fashion which is my favorite drink. Has that warm whisky smell with vanilla undertones."

It's very gender-neutral in my opinion, something that you'd love to smell on a boyfriend, or a girlfriend. Sweet and warm, but also a bit earthy and musky at the same time. It makes me visualize a wood cottage out in the mountains mid-winter, sitting on a leather couch decorated with pelts, in front of a roaring fireplace.

I always get compliments and am frequently asked what I'm wearing!  The only issue I have had is with the travel size sprays. I purchased 3 online through Sephora (on separate occasions) and every single one had leaked though the packaging, leaving an empty vial. I don't know if the cap and spray is too flimsy, but it was beyond disappointing to receive an item like that, more than once. Sephora was helpful in exchanging the items for me."

It lasts all day but not in a walk by someone or walk in the room and smell it up kind of way. I tuck my hair behind my ear and get a whiff or deliberately smell my wrist. My children smell it when they hug me. I told them both how good it smelled and had them smell it and they both were wowed. He is 8 and she is 3. I use to have numerous scents across all the different families but after having kids and increased allergies it is hard to find something I want to smell all day, even if I like it. I wouldn‚Äôt mind if air smelled this way. I did get a sample but after I purchased the Commodity Storybook. I will never have enough of this and plan to buy the bottle before I run out."

I was wrong, it is not too fancy for me. I judged it too soon, let it settle and dry and it smells like GOLD (perfect name). This is my new PERFECT going out scent that has my precious creamy vanilla swirled in. I went home with a sample and was so obsessed i later bought the travel size. Its almost gone and im most definately purchasing a full size. I wore this during my stay in vegas with my girlfriends and now all i can think of is vegas-sexy, sun, money, sweet temptation. I couldnt pass up sharing a review because this perfume is so amazing to me. LOVE! Its a strong enough and beautiful enough scent to be worn alone, but something i like and would recommend for a summery beachy vibe is to top it with Bobbi Browns, beach."

I wore the same fragrance for years, it's no longer being made. I found this after months of searching. It has a gentle vanilla/spicy smell that works for me; I cannot wear florals at all. It is not overpowering or overly sweet; I do not like when  fragrance wears me. I can wear this everyday, feel like it smells like me. Fragrance is an investment to me. If it were less expensive, that would be great, and i'm not sure I need to spend $300 on a bottle of perfume. But this product will last for a year, perhaps? So it's an investment I'm willing to make. I asked friends for their opinion, people who would say that's too strong or nope, keep looking. I get compliments from people who don't like fragrance. That's a winner for me."

I wear Flowerbomb, ysl black opium, Michael kors Sexy Amber, jadore, tocca florence, u get the picture.  The latest favorite was MK Amber, and I still love it but this one seems to be safer for the everyday office.  When I first put it on for my husband to sniff on me the first word out of his mouth was  mmmmmm creamsicle, which I wouldn't have ever thought of.  We all smell different descriptions, but I took his as a compliment since he is a very simple man who hates perfumes/colognes but his favorite ice cream is a creamsicle : )  I know this is a winner bc he usually coughs with disgust and waves at the air whenever I spray any perfume to go to work, but not with this.  This is warm, soothing, and pleasant.  It's not a snowstorm, but a lovely fluffy soft layer on your skin.  It's not a full on sexy, but definitely can be on the sexual spectrum with a mysterious you may not see me, but you feel me atmosphere.  I can smell the not so heavy vanilla bean and other notes.  I was close to giving this 4 stars only bc I wish it were a tiny tiny bit more heavier, but then again that might change everything that's so great about it.  For me, it doesn't last all day long, but maybe that's just my chemistry.  I plan to layer it and take it from there.  I will be buying the full bottle since my sample is gone.  my newest obsession. ....."

Once it's on, it develops into a lovely, spicy-(not too) sweet smell. A bit of vanilla and bourbon that really comes out once on the skin.  It's not cloyingly gourmande.  I will definitely be buying this again in the larger size once I run out of the smaller travel one I have (which will be soon!).  My only complaint is that the scent doesn't last as long as I'd like.  By the time I'm into the afternoon at work I can't smell it at all.  Seems to be a problem with most of the Commodity scents."

The perfume IS light, but I find that the sillage is still noticeable to those around me, and it lasts for many hours before fading into a very soft skin scent. The fragrance is never in-your-face pungent but it stays with you throughout the day. It's hard for me to imagine anyone being offended by this perfume as it doesn't veer into full gourmand territory, and the fragrance doesn't smell synthetic in the slightest.

When this is the main scent and you spritz some other perfume from Commodity's line (I've so far tried a good layer of Gold with a light spritz of Whiskey, Moss, or Wool, and each variation works well with my body chemistry), you end up smelling distinctively good, unique, and special.

Furthermore, I am a fragrance geek, I own at least 150 perfumes ranging in price from 39.00 to 300.00 and I research what goes into them to create the smell.

I do not own this fragrance, but I own Jazz Club so I passed on purchasing this. Try both out and see which one matches your chemistry."

			"review_text": "This is my new favorite fragrance! It has a warm elegance to it, with a lot of amber to it. It does not smell gourmand to me as described, more soft and cozy and rich, like a cream colored cashmere blanket, or a faux fur throw. The fragrance reminds me of something my mother wore when I was in grade school. The first whiff gave me a huge flash-back to that time in my life, but I can't put my finger on quite what it is. But I love it. It's beautiful and perfect. Not spicy or sexy. Just soft and elegant.  My only regret? It doesn't last long at all. Maybe 4 hours. Every Commodity perfume I've bought only lasts a couple hours. But the smells are so fun and unique that I'll just keep spraying."

			"review_text": "bought (travel size) blindly, as no testers are available at any of my local Sephora stores. not something i'd normally do, since purchasing fragrance based solely on an online description is exactly like buying wine you've never tried based on the label's description.  in this case, it completely worked out. the very 1st word that comes to mind when i smell this is chic. it's warm & soft (but not too soft). don't think i love it enough to drop the cash on the $100 full size, but i'm very very happy with the travel size, and would definitely get it again.  for reference...my absolute favorite fragrance is Dior Addict (the original), so if that's too powerful for you, this is a mellower alternative."

			"review_text": "I hate to ruin the 5 star run, but I can't quite go there. I purchased this without bothering to sample, after all, it featured a good number of my favorite notes: amber, sandalwood, vanilla, tonka beans, a touch of musk works, so long as we aren't going all 80s, Jovan Musk! Side note, but is it just me or does every note list these days start with Bergamot? lol Any way, when I first tried this fragrance, I immediately patted myself on the back for a good call. Although I did naturally wait for the dry down and was still loving it...later on, something stuck me as wrong! I started to worry if I really did like this scent, there was suddenly something that reminded me of...what? I couldn't place it. Since then, I have decided that although that discordant note does hit me once in a while, I still really enjoy this fragrance. As I look at the full list now, I am suspecting that it may very well be the camphor that is throwing me. Not that I am a traditionalist, I do often like things that are a bit edgy or non-conformist...but is camphor a note that I would pick when designing a scent, thinking maybe not. So all said, there are 10 notes listed for this fragrance and I think that I am enjoying 9 out of 10 (so yes, mathematically, 4.5 should be my rating! lol), just occasionally struck by that one note! And, what the heck, perfect is boring!"
