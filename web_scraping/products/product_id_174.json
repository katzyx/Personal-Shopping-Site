			"review_text": "I received the perfume set from Influenster to review.  I love the idea of layering the scents.  I tried them one by one also.  The pink Her is sweet, which is not my go to.  The Goddess is slightly musky and definitely one that enjoyed.  I found that the tiny bottles made it difficult to apply, so I only used a very small amount because of how it‚Äôs applied.  I might even use these and layer them with a 3rd perfume.  The size is great for travel.  On my most recent work trip, I took them and was so happy that there were no leaks.  The tops just pop on and off."

I think this set would make the perfect stocking filler gift. I love the packaging simple and easy slide out box. The bottles are nice, however I really wish mini bottles could have a spray mechanism. The tops are a bit hard to get off that‚Äôs my only real complaint. Also the Burberry Goddes bottle feels a bit more expensive and presents more luxury to me than the Burberry Her bottle. Burberry Her is a very fruity floral scent to me. I would wear it more in spring/summer. Burberry Goddess is a more rich vanilla and amber scent to me. In my opinion it‚Äôs a more everyday or year round scent. I find both to last fairly well throughout the day and have received  compliments on both. Overall I think the set is quite versatile with two very different scents which can be worn for different moods or occasions. I would definitely recommend this as a nice gift for any woman."

This is such an easy reach for and it last a good 6+ hours on me. This fragrance will garner many compliments.  Now Burberry Her is that it girl. She is fun, fruity and flirty. With top notes of strawberries, raspberries, blackberries, a bit of sour cherry lemon, orange and black currant. Her opens with a rush of strawberry that begins to dry down to a whipped strawberry milkshake. This is such a juicy fragrance that is sure to get you a compliment or two. This is definitely a favorite Burberry Her is a sure winner if you love fruity fragrances like myself she does not disappoint."

The Goddess scent is very vanilla, but a mixture of vanillas that give it a certain depth that you don‚Äôt expect when reading the description. The packaging is nice and I will get a lot of use out of this one. I would rate it individually at 4.5 stars."

Its beautiful jasmine and amber scent is incredibly sexy and feminine. I have never been a big fan of the warmer scent families, amber, vanilla, musk, etc...but the way they layered the subtle amber scent to the jasmine is... *chef's kiss*! I have approximately 50 fragrances in my collection and the only scent that my husband will stop what he is doing to smell my wrists or neck is Burberry Her. I also get so many compliments when I wear it. If you like alluring scents, this is a must for your collection!  Next is Burberry Goddess. It initially sparked skepticism in me, given my aversion to most vanilla perfumes. However, this fragrance defied expectations and became a truly enchanting experience. The blend of lavender, vanilla, and a subtle, woodsy note (perhaps patchouli) is simply beautiful. From the first sniff, a wave of unexpected joy washed over me. The scent is rich and evocative, conjuring up heartwarming memories of my grandmother. This is a testament to the power of scent. While it's a stronger fragrance, this is a positive attribute for me. The longevity is impressive, with the scent lingering beautifully throughout the day. If you're hesitant about vanilla perfumes like I was, I encourage you to give this one a try. It's a beautifully crafted fragrance that is both comforting and uplifting, making it a perfect choice for those who seek a rich, long-lasting, and truly memorable scent."

First off let me say that this sample set is a dabber and not in a spray bottle so that might have affected my experience with the perfumes.   Burberry Her is light and fruity and soft. I had to bring my nose to the points where I put it to smell it. It‚Äôs a nice none offensive scent that is mass appealing. Would probably be good in office spaces.   Burberry Goddess is a vanilla. Thicker scent than Her. But I could only smell it well in the opening and I am not sure if I went anosmic to it or it just faded. It is unfortunate because it‚Äôs a beautiful scent. Also, my friend wears this as one of her signature scents and I can only smell her when I meet her which is usually when we are going out and then I can‚Äôt smell her anymore. ü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è."

			"review_text": "Burberry Her and Goddess are truly an indispensable collection for any season! Her, with its upfront fruity notes like strawberry and cherry, feels to me, delightful and light, despite the warm, woody base notes that anchor it. This fragrance feels like a perfect choice for the warmer weather of Spring, especially. It's a great way to start the day with a fresh, invigorating scent that can carry you through until evening.  Goddess, on the other hand, is a more robust and denser fragrance. It opens with a rich, spicy note of ginger, balanced by the sweet, creamy vanilla. This feels like a bolder, colder weather fragrance, perfect for those crisp autumn or winter days. It's a scent that commands attention and leaves a lasting impression.  But the true value of this collection lies in its versatility. These fragrances are not just beautiful on their own, but they also complement each other beautifully when layered. Together they make a unique fragrance that is beautiful and unique!   In the time I've been using these fragrances, I've noticed that I get more compliments when I wear them together. And the best part? A few drops in the morning have lasted me from 7 am to 8 pm during a busy work day. I've found that with other fragrances, I often need to reapply midday or even several times throughout the day. But these two have a power and longevity that's truly impressive.   So, whether you're looking for a fresh, light scent for Spring, or a rich, spicy fragrance for Fall, or even if you're just looking to expand your fragrance collection, Burberry Her and Goddess are a collection you won't want to miss."

I like that the shape of these mini sizes are exactly like the full size version as opposed to the cylindrical sample tubes that most brands send out.

I have heard good things about both Burberry fragrances and wanted an easy way to try both. This would make a great gift for someone who enjoys gourmand fragrances.  Personal thoughts: I love Her - it has a bright berry bubblegum note with a sophisticated touch to it. I've never smelled a fragrance quite like this one before. Goddess, while not bad by any means, felt harder for me to approach as it has a stronger projection and a dry intensity despite being a vanilla scent. It is well made, but maybe too grown up for me? Regardless, I feel open to sharing and even giving away my tiny Goddess bottle since the packaging is so well made. I do not regret this purchase!"
