I may lose 1-3 hairs compared to the ”ouchless” black plastic/rubber kind that is difficult to remove, breaks and pulls way too much of my hair. One star off for the price; but worth not having the pain on my scalp and hello I need all the hair on my head. Bought it during the sale period."

These are actually amazing, I never knew I could love a scrunchie so much. It's a splurge but it was worth it."

But I'm so glad I caved and got them during the holiday sale. Now I kinda regrate that I did not get more! Such a noticeable difference! No more pulling and breakage. So gentle on my long fine hair. Would recommend for anyone that wants to grow their hair longer."
