While shopping in Ulta, a girl next to me told me I needed to smell this perfume and raved about how amazing it smells.  However, there was no sample available to try.  On my next trip to Sephora, I tried the sample and was instantly in love.  I feel this perfume is subtle, warm, cozy, musky, and perfect for cooler weather.  It is a beautiful scent.  I later purchased the travel size, too, so I can put it on after the gym in the A.m.  Since I am in Arizona, I want to enjoy this perfume as much as I can before it gets hot."

The lavender cools this vanilla down the perfect balance for me and never feels too warm, sweet or overwhelming, even in the spring and summer! This could be a signature scent hands down. I will probably always have this in my collection from here on out ✨🙌🏽✨"

Scent - the vanilla smells authentic and luxurious. There is a hint of warm spice to it and it balances well with the vanilla.  Wear test - I sprayed once in the evening and the scent lasted the next morning. A little goes a long way and didn't smell overpowering.  Overall comments and review - seeing this product is an Allure 2024 Best of Beauty Award Winner, I decided to purchase this. I'm glad I did and I feel this scent is great for anyone interested in adding a vanilla scent to their collection, a scent that can be used any time of the year, or a gift to someone who wants to discover a signature scent. It is worth it for a good vanilla perfume, and Burberry Goddess is perfect. I would highly recommend."

It smelled like coconut and buttered toast and just grew during the day and gave me such a headache.  I could not wait to take a shower and get it off.  I realize that what I probably liked in store was the mix of the five fragrances I kinda mixed together when sampling.   Whoops."

It's a very soft and calming smell. I love the lavender and vanilla together! I don't smell much spice in this, but maybe that's just because I'm used to much spicier perfumes like Glossier You? Anyways, I would say this is 100% a safe blind buy. I think this scent would smell lovely on anyone. This smells expensive. Not like your typical cheap vanilla body spray that smells sickeningly sweet. I would say it's a more grown-up version of vanilla. Not as gourmand as I thought it would be, and I'm not mad at it tbh. I find myself constantly sniffing my wrists when I put this on. I haven't been complimented on it yet, but I work from home and hardly go anywhere, so what can you do 😂"

But I'm not here to discuss eau de toilettes or toilets, this is about a magnificent Eau de Parfum which I have only just discovered. On my clothes I can often smell it even the next day. On my skin however I need to top up at least twice in order for this to last me a full day. Projection isn't extraordinary but then again I do prefer closer to skin scents. If you can pick up the lotion too and make sure to apply it before the fragrance, it definitely makes it last longer in my opinion. The ginger note gives it a subtle spicy kick and when it dries down there is a lot of Vanilla-Cocoa if that's your kind of thing (I know it's mine!). I do own a number of Vanilla's such as Guerlain's Vanilla Bosca, but overall I prefer this one! I think it's the Lavender in here that really sets this apart from other vanilla's. Cozy, elegant, not overly gourmand and definitely a compliment getter!   ~ My Top 5 Beauty must-have list ~  1. Hair Loss Treatment: ‘Divine Herbal’ - Hair Oil  2.

			"review_text": "As an energetic fragrance aficionado, I've experienced various aromas, however none very like Burberry Goddess. From the second I spritzed it on, I was spellbound by captivating smell easily mixes complexity with exotic nature.  The primary thing that struck me was the inebriating mix of flower and woody notes, which make an amicable orchestra that moves on the skin. With each whiff, I'm moved to a tranquil nursery blossoming with jasmine and magnolia, while inconspicuous traces of sandalwood and golden add profundity and warmth to the scent.  What genuinely separates Burberry Goddess is its capacity to bring out appreciation any place I go. It's exceptional the number of praises I that get while wearing this scent. Whether I'm going to a party or basically getting things done, individuals can't resist the urge to ask about the charming fragrance that encompasses me.  Additionally, the life span of this fragrance is unrivaled. Indeed, even following a monotonous day, the fragrance waits gently on my skin, leaving a path of charm any place I go. It resembles having my very own quality of refinement and appeal.  All in all, Burberry Goddess isn't simply a scent — it's an encounter. Its heavenly fragrance has an enduring effect, making it perhaps of the best scent I've at any point had the delight of wearing. Assuming that you're looking for a scent that radiates tastefulness and earns praises easily, look no farther than Burberry Goddess."

			"review_text": "Obsessed, if this was a cake I'd eat it! I bought this with my own money in a Sephora store, not incentivized, and honestly wish that I bought an even bigger size or the gift set. I have never bought a perfume so fast after spritzing it on my coat at Sephora. This is such a beautiful, well-balanced, and rounded vanilla trio, with a sprinkling of lavender on top that leans more sweet and airy rather than a heavier fougere--reminds me a bit of having a nice hot creamy, milky tea, for some reason. No weird off-notes here, everything's very delicately blended imo. Projection is very mild, but when you move, others will smell you. Spraying 4-5 sprays on my clothes means I can smell it from half a room's length away, and well until the next day. I think this is one of those fragrances where you might be nose-blind faster, but definitely everyone can still smell you. Longevity is a little better, lasting for around a day. The lavender notes are more prominent at the beginning but disappear in the drydown, a little intense right now at first spray, but that will probably round itself out as my bottle oxidizes. Maceration in a dark cool space may help, as it does with all vanillas; I've only had it a few days and the vanilla's starting to smell a wee bit stronger than when I just opened the bottle and the lavender's much less sharp. The store tester was beast-mode vanilla so I expect it to smell like that in a few months and some. The vanillas eventually fade off into a warm ambery scent in the drydown, which I love. The vanillas also seem a little different--not Tahitian or island-y generally with freshness, but sort of honeyed and gourmet--they read a lot foodier and pastry-like than I expected. Might buy another bigger bottle before the sale is over, before any reformulations or batch changes occur, I like the particular bottle that I got in-store and have noticed that sometimes post-covid batches of perfume at Sephora can have a lot of variability, unfortunately."

People say it doesn't last - but if you spray it on your clothes it will stay for days! I am always spraying under my collarbones, so it stays well and gets on my clothes too - no problem. Compared to other Vanilla perfumes, this (and Mugler Alien Goddess Intense) are my most favorites (I favor them over mainstream Tom Ford perfumes).   The thing is, it's tender and subtle and it doesn't smell perfumy - not like a signature perfume, not like obvious. So if you like perfumy smells (Libre for example, is very perfumy to me), you might get dissapointed. It is too vanilla (haha!). For me, I want to smell good and I don't care if someone recognizes my perfume or not, as long as everyone remembers that I am pleasant :) I would say that for perfumy girls - check out Alien Goddess Intense by Mugler. It seems to be that they are relatives, but Mugler smells like a signature perfume! But first, check it on your skin, don't buy it blind lol"

This fragrance is simply amazing. The staying power is unmatched on the skin and clothes. As much as I love vanilla, the trio made me worry it was going to be basic/generic/simple...but I was sorely mistaken. It is sophisticated, cozy, and complex. I don't consider myself a lavender fan, so i was hesitant but it creates a great balance. I've always wanted a signature scent, and I think I finally found it. Never stop making this!"

			"review_text": "This is literally just a basic vanilla. I was given the opportunity to review this by Topbox, which I am so very appreciative of, but I have to say, Burberry Goddess is nothing but a basic vanilla. I was so excited to smell it after all the hype on social media, but when I finally did I was severely disappointed. I kept smelling my arm to make sure I wasn't going crazy. My cousin, who was also with me and smelling it had the exact same reaction. Its a fairly soft scent (unless you overspray) so the projection was decent (not a lot of sillage, but also not necessarily a skin scent). It lasted for about 3-4 hrs, turning into a skin scent at the 3hr mark. It is fairly inoffensive, so that is a plus, but it isn't very unique.  A fragrance like this will always garner compliments because people tend to like sweet smelling fragrances and vanilla helps in that area, but its honestly not even that sweet. To me, the price is abysmal for such a basic fragrance. If I am going to pay this price, it better be unique and have something special about it. Unfortunately, I don't believe this fragrance is any of those things. I have a fairly decent-sized fragrance collection, and I don't know if it is just because I have smelled a ton of fragrances, so it may seem basic to me, so that is also a possibility. But I definitely know you can find much better vanillas for a MUCH better price. So even if the smell is better to you than I am describing, the price isn't worth it, in my humble opinion; especially for a designer fragrance.... this is getting into niche territory.... ain't nobody got time fo dat."

Either way, I love it, it is long lasting to me and I will repurchase.  It is a warm, soft feminine vanilla. Definitely try the travel size first to see if you like before making the plunge on the full size."

If you layer it with Goddess, it definitely extends it without changing the scent more than any other fragrance I’ve found.  It’s identical minus the lavender of goddess.    found that"

Considering that I love vanilla scents but also want something that smells a bit more mature/professional than BBW warm vanilla sugar or vanilla bean noel, I was really excited about this. Upon initial spray, the scent is beautiful. I will say that I don't get much vanilla- mostly ginger to be honest. But the scent is nice, and while I was applying some my sister mentioned how good it smelled. However, I can't get more than about 2 hours out of this perfume, if that. I've tried everything- applying on top of perfume oils, applying straight after lotion, spraying clothing all over, etc. Nothing gets this scent to stay. When applying on top of the Nemat vanilla perfume oil, it initially smells amazing. By the end of the day, I can still smell the Nemat on me, but this perfume is totally gone. If this were a cheaper perfume or a body spray I'd understand, but considering how expensive this is I really wish the scent lasted longer."

I normally am not crazy about vanilla scented perfumes but this fragrance is so luxurious and sweet. It also has staying power. Lasts all day and into the evening however I like to add just a touch more in the evening. Burberry Goddess is a winner in my book. I think this will become a true classic. So many girls ask me what I am wearing. They love this sweet fragrance as much as I do. Thank you for the opportunity to try this amazing perfume @TopBoxCircle."

I smelled it and immediately fell in love! I purchased the travel pen spray that same day and used it for a week to make sure I still enjoyed it. I definitely do, have received so many compliments! I purchased the 3.3 oz gift set! This will definitely be my go to scent for the foreseeable future. It smells kind of similar to Sol de Janiero original bum bum cream (Cheriosa 62) but a more mature version of it."

What I love about Goddess is that wonderful woody vanilla tone with just a hint of lavender. It sets the scent off perfectly and brings attention to me throughout the day.  When I wear it, I seem to feel noticed. Maybe it’s all the compliments I receive, but I enjoy it.  I appreciate that it is not overwhelming in smell, just perfect for being noticed throughout the day.  Props to Burberry for making women feel noticed. It’s a wonderful feeling."

Simple doesn't have to mean cheap smelling and Burberry has hit the nail on the head again for me. I agree that you need to let this dry down before you make a decision. Body chemistry is always a big factor with perfume in my experience. The scent lasts an ok amount of time, I wish it stayed a little longer. Love love love."

			"review_text": "very kindly gifted me to try by Burberry. Titled quite simple Goddess ⚜️ this is Burberry’s first refillable fragrance!  A Gourmand fragrance designed to reflect the power within, the journey of self discovery taken along a path of confidence, strength, and kindness   Crafted with 3 distinct vanillas, all collected by hand, dried in the sun for 5-7 weeks and, finally, matured in wooden boxes. These are enhanced with a luminous lavender.   ⚜️The distinct notes ~ * Top - Vanilla, Lavender, Cacao and Ginger * Middle - Vanilla Caviar  * Base - Vanilla Absolute  💭 Before I even open this bottle, can we please take a sensoral moment to appreciate the warmth, and depth of the entire package! The look of a liquid gold encased in this elegant, timeless bottle.    Now you may have heard, I’m a bit picky about my vanillas, so part of me is afraid to even try this.  What if I don’t like it? 😢🥹   Here we go ~  No need to fear, this, this is what a vanilla should always and forever be.   At first pass, just in the air, I’m transported to a timeless cafe, perhaps in France? With the doors open and the aroma from beautiful baked confections passing by me in a light breeze.  I can close my eyes and almost taste the gloriousness  When I apply it, the lightest breath of lavender pulls back the sweetness, letting it fully develop and mingle with the cacao, giving it more depth and it just matures from there. This is not your average vanilla, this is the pinnacle! It emits warmth, sensuality, power, and just raw strength  I have found my favorite gourmand fragrance. I have found my favorite vanilla fragrance, and must congratulate and thank Burberry, as well as Amandine Clerc-Marie, Master Perfumer, on a truly glorious fragrance and for allowing me to share in its beauty"

Thank god the scent doesn't last longer than an hour otherwise I would've showered to get it off me.

An easy and beautiful fragrance to wear for any occasion! For me, the longevity and projection are great, I can smell it all day long! It’s a little different from the other Burberry fragrances, but as long as you like vanilla I think it’s a pretty safe blind buy! For reference, a few of my favorite vanillas are JHAG Vanilla Vibes, Ralph Lauren Beyond Romance, Alien Goddess, Kayali Utopia Vanilla Coco 21, Kayali Vanilla 28, and the 7 Virtues Vanilla Woods!"

I love it so much I also purchased the mini spray for travel/my purse. I didn’t find it at all cloying/too sweet & it definitely didn’t smell like a candle OR an “old lady” :) Really lovely scent."

The first spray, you are enveloped by vanilla, gourmand, sweetness, smoothness, floral, luxury, opulence, and sophistication.  Even though I usually prefer sweet, fruity scent profiles, I love this perfume. It’s not an overwhelming sweet vanilla, and it finishes with a floral scent.  I received compliments from everyone. I even got my coworker to buy this perfume. My boyfriend can’t stop smelling me. I can’t stop smelling myself. My mom is sensitive to smell and highly critical yet she has approved this smell as well. Loved by many.  I appreciate the travel-friendly size of the bottle, especially its archive-inspired design of the bottle. Simple yet elegant like its smell. It’s also vegan if you’re clean-beauty conscious!  Burberry states: “Gourmand scent led by a trio of vanillas and enriched with luminous lavender. The vanilla is collected by hand, then the beans spend five to seven weeks drying in the sun, before being stored in wooden boxes to mature and develop their sweet, signature aroma.”   There’s even a slight disclaimer that the color will change because the perfume contains vanilla."

The scent is all about sweet vanilla, and it sticks around for hours, which my boyfriend absolutely loves.  But what makes it extra special is how intimate it feels. It's like a beautiful secret you can share with someone special. When you smell it, you can't help but feel closer to them.  At first, it's simple and inviting, but as time goes on, it turns into this complex mix of scents. There's a hint of lavender that makes it interesting.  My partner adores it, and honestly, so do I. It's not just a perfume; it's an experience and a feeling. It's like capturing a special moment with every spritz."

The staying power last around 6 hours. I have been complimented several times and asked what I have on while wearing this perfume. My husband who usually doesn’t care for perfume loves the scent of the Burberry goddess. Even my 22 year old son loves it and bought a bottle for his girlfriend. The bottle is a beautiful classy glass. This unique gourmand fragrance is made with a vegan formula led by a powerful trio of vanillas. On top, a vanilla infusion with woody tonalities, at the heart a vanilla caviar with a rich sweetness, and at the base a vanilla absolute enriched with luminous lavender. I would recommend this perfume to anyone that is looking for a beautiful true vanilla scent."

The words that come to mind is golden goddess so they done a great job with the name! My favorite perfume is ysl libre intense so if you're a fan of that line, you will also like this one. The only complaint I have is that it doesn't last as long as you would expect a parfum to last, which seems to be par for the course for most perfumes nowadays. You have to spray every couple of hours on the skin but it stays much longer on clothing although faint. This would make a fabulous gift! I'll definitely be repurchasing when I run out!"

I'm not a big fan of vanilla scents so I was surprised I liked this one...then again to me it doesn't smell like vanilla till the end of the day. Literally the only Burberry perfume I like, not a fan of their others. Had to give it three stars though because it does not last on skin. If you spritz your clothes you're fine and by the end of the day you'll smell like vanilla because although it doesn't initially smell like vanilla it does when it dries down. I sprayed this on my elbow pits, neck, and behind my ears...drove 40 minutes to see a friend asked her how I smelled and she couldn't even tell I was wearing perfume that's how bad the staying power of this perfume is. I then went to a sephora with her to show her the perfume...sprayed myself again in store and within an hour I smelled like I wasn't wearing anything. I truly love the way it smells but I don't think I'll repurchase because it doesn't stay on. I think I'd rather wear sol de janeiro 40...it smells like gentle fluidity gold by MFK (another vanilla scent...again I swear I don't usually like vanilla) because all though it doesn't smell the same (beautiful in its own way) at least by the time I get ready for bed I still smell like it."

I love the gold detailing that complements the ambery/golden color of both the glass bottle and the intoxicating juice inside. I think there's a good amount of perfume oil in the bottle because there's a glow it gives the skin after it dries down. This is lovely to wear all year round but will be great in the fall--- as all gourmands are. This is not cloyingly sweet though. This is a sexy, feminine, comfy warm hug. It's vanilla on vanilla on vanilla, which I  love...but it's more complex---expensive vanilla. It's aromatic with so much depth. The vanilla is spicy. The lavender is gentle instead of masculine. I prefer to spray it on about an hour before stepping out so as to allow it to settle into my skin and clothing. I also like to spray a little of it on before bed. Top notes are vanilla infusion, cacao, ginger, and lavender; middle note is vanilla caviar, and base note vanilla absolute—A great gift for a gourmand lover! It’s also vegan."

This Burberry Goddess fragrance exceeded my expectations. This is not your basic vanilla fragrance. You get the warm, rich, characteristics of the vanilla with the faint bitter and almost buttery smooth smell of caramel. Paired with this rich sweetness is the elegant notes of flowers that tone down the the vanilla that can be over bearing in other products that are vanilla based.  There are the perfect combinations of aromas in this perfume that make it super feminine and also alluring. I have worn this almost daily since receiving it and have had many compliments. Overall, it  is an elegant, classy fragrance that is suitable for daytime or nighttime and lasts up to 10 hours without having to reapply. I am very pleased with this fragrance and would definitelyrecommend it."

Burberry Goddess's intoxicating scent is housed in an eye-catching square clear glass bottle with a gold Burberry medallion in the center and topped with a gold cap. The fragrance itself is a golden liquid, which pulls the entire gorgeously golden Luxe packaging together! The box is just as beautiful as the bottle, a pale pinkish-champagne colored box with a golden label in the center. The presentation of Burberry Goddess is stunning!

I definitely get the warmth of the vanilla but then also something else, which I assume is the floral/lavender component. As it dries down it does get a bit more vanilla-y but never cloying, never in-your-face vanilla. There's always something else that balances it perfectly and makes it a sophisticated fragrance instead of I just poured vanilla extract all over myself, if that makes sense. I'm definitely going to be wearing this all fall and winter (though I think it could be worn all year), just ordered the full sized bottle. The only negative I have to say is that it only lasts about 4-5 hours on me, which is about average. I do find spraying it on my clothes helps."

I won’t say it smells bad, because it definitely does have a captivating scent to it and it smells expensive and of wonderful quality. That being said, I personally feel that it has too strong of a caramel/vanilla scent. Upon spraying, I immediately noticed a sweet vanilla smell. After a few moments, all that I could smell was pure caramel. I’m not sure why, as I don’t believe this has any notes of caramel in it. I know others love the smell, and I even got compliments while wearing it, so I know it smells great to some! But on a personal level, I couldn’t get past the super sweet caramel smell, as I felt like I was a walking candy display. I know that every scent reacts differently with every persons skin, so this may not be the case for others. While I wouldn’t reach for this often, I can see certain occasions where this may work well. Would I recommend? Yes, as I think others may absolutely love this perfume. Would I personally purchase? Unfortunately, no, as I don’t feel this scent suits me."

Personally on me, the vanilla becomes a warm, powdery, sweet that is very clean and versatile. Definitely a fall/winter scent dominantly but could also be a daily wear if that is your style.

However, the final stages of drydown, when the fragrance settles on the skin, might be somewhat uninteresting. I reapplied it a few hours later, and it turned out to be decently good.

The tricks I follow are - use an oil first, then spray and do NOT rub, let it dry. I’ve used MYTH by Ellis for a while - layering them is absolutely amazing. I use MYTH as a base scent, I don’t love it alone. Together it was an absolute dream! It makes this last longer and takes this luxury to the next level. I hope you get to give it a chance!"

It definitely has the perfect amount of vanilla (it’s very much there too) with very subtle fresh herby smell. This is perfect for business attire, date nights or night outs, it’s a very “mature” smell if that makes sense. I felt super confident and extremely happy with the long wear.

The perfume is extremely long lasting, my husband commented that I leave a trail of perfume as I walk even after an 8-hour day outside. I personally prefer the more balanced vanilla-wood mixture after about 3 hours of wear. The initial heaviness of the vanilla makes me think this scent is more suitable to fall/winter.

This is fine if you’re okay with that but if you don’t have the time/don’t want to carry a bottle all day it could be a problem. It did work wonders on my shirt, however - I’m not sure how it binds to the fabric but my clothing kept the smell for days.

It is sophisticated enough to be your Girl Boss fragrance for work, and just sultry enough for date night with hubby. I have never worn a more beautiful fragrance or felt more elegant wearing one (even my Chanel!).   The bottle is gorgeous, and as a HUGE plus, refillable!

I normally prefer fragrances with fresh, fruity, floral, woody, and green notes for the most part, so when I was given this fragrance in exchange for my honest review by Influenster and Burberry, I did not expect all that much. However, I have to say that it may have changed my opinion on at least vanilla heavy fragrances because I did really enjoy this one after wearing it a few times. I didn't get too much lavender, and it mostly came at first spritz. After a bit, I got a pretty rich and decadent, almost chocolatey vanilla which then dried down to be a little bit more boozy. On my skin, this lasted quite a while. I'd say about 7 hours later and people around me were still commenting on it. And, I got so many compliments on this one. I am big on fragrance and I wear a nice perfume every day, but I have never gotten so many compliments as I did with this one. It seems like it's a real crowd pleaser and would probably be a great gift. So although it's something a little different than my usual jam, I still think this one deserves 5 stars. I will note though that the name could have been more original, especially given the fact that Mugler already has an Alien Goddess that is also vanilla heavy, and the packaging in my opinion could be better. It looks like something Versace should have released maybe 10 years ago. However, that doesn't change the juice inside and it's what's inside that counts, right?"

For the most part it is not a skin scent until the very last which I'm guessing was at about six hours. I haven't cared for Burberry fragrances in the past and they've somewhat been nose tweakers but they've really stepped up their fragrance game in my opinion and their recent releases have been enjoyable.

My mom even sprayed it in her laundry room and it smelled so good for days! I’ve had other nice perfumes in the past, and this definitely compares in both scent and longevity."

So far, Burberry women's perfume has many different product lines. So choosing for myself a suitable scent is very difficult. And now by accident I was given a perfume bottle from this brand that was just launched in early August 2023, with a very luxurious name. Burberry Goddess ... not only the name but the design is also really eye-catching. Square perfume bottle. With transparent glass design to reveal the juice. The juice is light yellow in color. The lid and the sticker are all gilded to create a luxurious feeling, symbolizing the noble sophistication, honoring the woman with the name of the goddess... A really great gift for boyfriends, husband gift to his wife or girlfriend....The next thing when I lightly spray the perfume on my hands I feel a warm and sweet aroma combined with the freshness and purity of vanilla and lavender. fragrance, creating a gentle and refreshing melody from the first moment.. The scent lasts a very long time, can keep from 8 hours to 12 hours after I sprayed it on my hands, after 4 times of hand washing it still remains. the scent is faint...I really appreciate this new product...Once it's over, I will consider buying it again and will be a gift that you and I can buy for your loved ones on Christmas. next..."

I’m a fan of YSL Libre and all of the flankers, so I was excited for a different take on lavender/vanilla. Thankfully, this one is very feminine and less masculine than Libre. The ginger is a nice addition, you can definitely reach for this all year. Fresh for warm weather, sweet enough for cold weather. I’m excited to try this one again after it’s macerated for a month or two and it’s 60 degrees outside. On the other hand, the pricing is a little steep. $100 for a 30ml is a little ridiculous, especially for a regular edp with iffy longevity. Designers shouldn’t be asking for more than $89 for a 1 oz, especially when strong fragrances with amazing performance like Good Girl and La Belle are at $73. Will I still purchase it? Yes, because I'm a collector and it’s a beautiful scent."

As someone who personally loves vanilla scents, one spray on my wrist was all it took for me to fall in love with this gourmand fragrance! I sprayed it on both wrists and behind the ears, wore it to work the whole day and got compliments. I definitely felt beautiful and confident wearing this scent. It can come off strong though to someone with a sensitive nose. A little goes a long way with this scent. The bottle was designed to be refillable, which I think is really conscientious. I'm really glad I got this to try for free."

Overall, a very pleasing and not overwhelming scent. This is vegan and the vanilla is sourced from Madagascar!   2. The Wear The first spray seems intense but after a few minutes it softens. I honestly like how it smells as a fades through the day. If you like a heavier wear, you do need to respray every few hours.   3. Design & Packaging  As a beauty packaging designer, I think the bottle design is well elevated. It looks rich and expensive in a simple sleek style. There’s a lot of details in the cap, spray nozzle and logo. The gold and warm color bottle matches the scent well."

Burberry Goddess, the newest edition to the esteemed Burberry fragrance lineup, is as close to perfect as it gets.  Its layers of vanilla are comfortable and cozy, but the hint of lavender keep it from being seasonal.  This is truly a year round scent.  Goddess is sophisticated, but not stuffy. Judging from the range of people I received compliments from while wearing it, this perfume is ageless too."

I’m pretty particular about fragrances and generally wear citrusy, light, clean fragrances (Diptyque Eau Des sens, Le Labo Matcha), so the vanilla notes—which get top billing—made me think it would be too creamy and rich. But this is a vibrant, bright vanilla. While vanilla is the star of the show, it’s not cloying or sweet but layered nicely with floral notes that make it more effervescent than one might expect. And it dries down into a scent that blends nicely with the skin while also being prominent enough to get wafts all day. I am a fan. I still prefer bright, more clean fragrances for everyday but will be wearing this for special occasions, since it feels a little more special and romantic. But I think if you gravitate towards vanilla fragrances you’d have no problem using this as a daily wear. It’s inoffensive and bright enough not to overwhelm (and only a couple small sprays go a long way!).   Full disclosure, I got this as an incentivized review but as someone who is VERY picky with fragrances this is my very honest opinion. Pleasantly impressed!"

The scent is categorized as an Aromatic. I was surprised that it wasn’t a gourmand with all that vanilla but once I smelled it, I understood. The opening when I first sprayed reminded me of YSL’s Libre. It wasn’t the sweet, typical vanilla you might imagine. It’s deeper and more like the actual vanilla plant. That makes sense since vanilla caviar is the seeds and pulp that are scraped from the inside of the pod. This was a heavier, warm scent but it wore more lightly than I expected. Overall, this is a great addition to my collection. It works great when layered with a variety of other fragrances. I liked how it really focused on vanilla in a unique way. While in the bottle, you might think this smells like a traditional more heavy, perfume-y mature scent, but I suggest wearing it to really experience the nuances because as I said, it didn’t wear heavy at all on me. The projection and longevity were both on the low end; I personally prefer stronger scents that last forever. I’d love to see other similar scents that show different sides of an ingredient. I’m dreaming of a chocolatey cacao scent, which I think would be amazing as a set with this perfume!"

I was looking forward to trying this perfume because fragrances with Vanilla can be a hit or miss at times.   I like the bottle’s design, classic but luxurious and can see this sitting on top of my dresser. I like that the bottle can be refilled.  The scent at first can smell intense once sprayed but with time the scent tones down in intensity which I like. I don’t enjoy an overpowering Vanilla scent and at first was worried this would be the case.  The description for the perfume mentions Top: Vanilla Infusion, Lavender; Middle: Vanilla Caviar; Base: Vanilla Absolute but I cannot smell anything Lavender in it.   The scent is long lasting. I tested it out in different times and each time I could still smell the perfume lingering by the end of the night.   I received the 1.6 bottle and see that it is priced at $129 so I do find it to be  a bit pricey. So if you are not a fan of the Vanilla smell then this would definitely be something to pass on.  If you love the Vanilla scent or Burberry brand then I would say this is definitely worth trying.  I would personally prefer to use this during the Fall/Winter time instead of summertime. So I think I will use it more during those times."

Cons Scent is nothing innovative for fragrance fanatics Performance really declines after 1-2 hours  Pros Non-offensive scent Leaves a light sweet vanilla scent on the skin Perfect gourmand for summer Elegant & simplistic bottle design Refillable bottle  Other notes: Since this is a vanilla scent, liquid might change color over time.  I see this as a perfect gift for a recent collect graduate or anyone’s first designer perfume. Scent is strong but still light enough to wear in the summer heat (just don’t over spray it). Perfect for summer nights . Overall a non-offensive scent that can be worn every day and any season, I quite enjoyed wearing it and will definitely be reaching out for it frequently."

There are hints of lavender, sweetness and vanilla. It tries down to a beautiful vanilla that is not overly sweet or musky. It is a very complex fragrance that is perfect on its own or layered with another fragrance. It is extremely long lasting but is not strong. It is very light making it perfect for summer or for someone that wants a more subtle fragrance."

This perfume smells like the feeling of falling in love next to a fireplace: warm, romantic, and lingering in the air for hours and hours. My first impression was a woodsy musk, but spraying it on my skin revealed layers of sweet vanilla that give off a sense of softness. However, this perfume is anything BUT soft in terms of potency: it comes on strong and stays on long. I tried one spray on my neck and one on each wrist, but in the future I would be more likely to do a half spray on my neck and one spray rubbed between my wrists since it has such an intense initial application. Hours into wearing it the fragrance is still definitely noticeable but has turned into an elegant sweet musk and I must honestly say I LOVE it! I’ve never had a perfume stay on this well or make me feel so empowered, and I’m extremely picky with my perfumes. Nevertheless, Goddess by Burberry is so mesmerizing that I’m looking forward to wearing it out just to show it off!"

Vanilla is the most prominent scent and I couldn’t really pick up lavender notes or it just smells mild to me. It smells woodsy, classy, sophisticated, and elegant, just like the glass container and packaging. I like vanilla perfumes but I prefer it mixed in equally with other scents and not as the main scent. This perfume lasts for about 6 hours or so then becomes a mild scent at the end of the day. I just did one spray on my inner elbow since it smells overpowering in the beginning. This perfume will do well in the fall/winter. It’s pricey but give it a try and see if it’s worth it for your preference/taste."

Most smell very overstimulating, tacky & childish, but Goddess by Burberry really elevated the standard by providing the perfect mixtures of vanilla. This is NOT your stereotypical vanilla perfume & I am in love!  Goddess has an elegant hint of vanilla lavender, hint of a sexy woody version of vanilla and lavish sweet & rich vanilla.  The lavender note definitely makes this perfume unique by adding a fresh scent to the sweetness, so it’s not too overpowering.  Another reason why I adore this perfume is because it’s refillable. Yes, once you spray away to an empty bottle, it allows you to refill it with its unique design. (The refill is of course sold separately).   Since it’s a perfume, it’s oil-based which lasts longer on the skin. I’d say this perfume is very loud, so one spray goes a long way… which I LOVE. It’s a sprinkle of fun, flirty, sexy & elegance. So run, don’t walk & grab yourself one... It will absolutely be worth your while!"

From the moment I sprayed it on, I was captivated by its alluring and elegant aroma.  The fragrance opens with a burst of fresh and fruity notes that instantly uplift the senses. As it settles, the heart of the scent reveals a delicate floral bouquet, which adds a touch of femininity and sophistication. What sets this perfume apart is the warm and sensuous base, featuring hints of musk and amber that linger beautifully throughout the day.  What I love about Burberry Goddess is its versatility. It's perfect for both daytime wear, adding a subtle aura of luxury to any occasion, and also transitions effortlessly into evening events, exuding an air of confidence and allure.  One of the best aspects of this perfume is its longevity. I found that a few spritzes in the morning lasted well into the evening, keeping me enveloped in its enchanting essence without overpowering others around me.  The packaging is also worth mentioning. The elegant bottle with the iconic Burberry check pattern adds a touch of class to any vanity or handbag.  In conclusion, Burberry Goddess is a true masterpiece that makes me feel empowered and effortlessly glamorous. If you're looking for a fragrance that embodies sophistication and allure, this is a must-have for your collection."

It does smell expensive and elegant.   For such a warm scent, I found that it didn't last as long as I expected. If I spray it on the in morning, it's usually not noticeable by the mid-afternoon.

Fragrance bottle is designed to be refilled and that is something I love, and vegan formula? I’ll definitely be purchasing this later on."

I generally am not super fond of vanilla based perfume solely on the fact that my step mother wore it most of the time so it feels a little mature to me.  That said this perfume does smell very different than your Grandma’s vanilla perfume.  The vanilla and lavender mixed together make it not as sweet and more of a warm vanilla bean smell.  It’s almost like I can smell toasted marshmallows in it too.  I think it would be great to wear on a date with my boyfriend or a night on the town.  It smells luxurious and fancy, like I would imagine a bronzed Egyptian Goddess would smell while she’s sunbathing on her balcony overlooking the pyramids.

I dab on my wrists and neck at 6 am, and when I come home at 5 pm you can still smell it. I have never had a perfume last this long before. The bottle looks stunning on my counter top also, as it’s a simple and elegant design. Burberry really crafted a winner here.

This is definitely sweeter though because of the vanilla which is what I like most about this fragrance! This is a love for me! 😊👍🏽  I love how elegant and sturdy the bottle is. It definitely exudes goddess vibes and makes me feel like one when I wear it. 🥰  I get 9hrs+ wear out of this fragrance. It also has calming qualities because of the lavender.

I have been wearing it day to day or out and about it’s truly versatile. I noticed that the longer she sits the more creamy and smoothe the  vanilla becomes so I’m very happy to be picked for this campaign.

The scent isnt too heavy or strong and would be great for any occasion. It lasted most of the day, maybe need to reapply if going out in the evening. The bottle has a very clean, luxurious feel and is also refillable which is a nice feature.  The only criticism about this perfume would be is I noticed when I first spritzed it, there's was a slight chemical smell, but it went away almost immediately.  Overall, its a delightful fragrance and would definitely recommend."

One little sniff will automatically have you rolling your eyes back with desire. I can't stop smelling my own wrists lol. It does however need a mid day renewal spray since it does fade off.

			"review_text": "I received this product through Influenster .  The Burberry Goddess Eau De Parfum is a fragrance that promises a captivating and alluring experience. Upon trying it, I found myself unsure with the overall performance and scent.  Firstly, the longevity of this perfume is quite underwhelming. Within just a few hours of application, the scent fades away completely, leaving no trace behind. This lack of staying power is disappointing considering its relatively high price point.  Moreover, the fragrance itself does not live up to its claims of being captivating and goddess-like. The initial notes are pleasant enough with hints of floral and fruity undertones, but as time goes on, it becomes overwhelmingly sweet and cloying. It lacks complexity and depth that one would expect from a high-end perfume.  Additionally, the packaging feels cheap and uninspired. The bottle design lacks creativity or elegance that one would associate with a luxury brand like Burberry."

It lasts all day on my skin so you don't need to spray a lot, one or two sprays is enough. It seemed to get sweeter after a few hours on my skin. I could also still smell the lavender after a few hours however it did seem to slightly fade over time. I am a vanilla lover so I was very happy to receive this in my VoxBox. It is probably a safe blind buy if you are also a vanilla lover, but if possible,  I would definitely recommend testing it first. As a comparison, it reminds me of Mon Gerlain but with more vanilla and freshness and less lavender."

			"review_text": "Thank you so very much Influenster and Burberry for my free perfume to review yes absolutely free!!! Inside of the box was a beautiful bottle of 1.6oz Burberry Goddess perfume. Fun Fact, it hits store shelves today (Aug 1st, 2023) so be one of the first to go grab a bottle. Trust me, you will be so sad if you don't, because the smell is absolutely amazing. The packaging is high end and so beautiful. The scent notes used in this beautiful smelling perfume are vanilla with a touch of lavender. There are 3 different vanilla notes in there. One is vanilla caviar- it has a sweet rich and animalic vanilla scent. The second is vanilla absolute- this is a darker and richer scent, enhancing the fragrance with a mysterious milky aspect. The 3rd vanilla note is a vanilla infusion- It's the brightest woody vanilla scent. There are also touches of cocoa and ginger. The note that is the strongest is the vanilla notes. The first inital sprays are on the stronger side but as it settles and dissipates a bit, the smells are heavenly!!! to say the least. I was running a few errands yesterday and so many people (men and women) kept stopping me to ask what scent I was wearing. Ladies, the smeel drew them in. I live in Vegas so it is extremely hot here. I was worried that the scent wouldn't last throughout the day in the heat, because we all know that sweat has a Tendency to wash away even the finest scent. To my excitement, the scent lasted all day long, well into the evening. I love Burberry Goddess and will absolutely repurchase again and again. Thank you Burberry and Influenster. I found my new signature scent. Also on a side note, if you like layering scents, I have paired the Burberry Goddess perfume with the Sol Janerio Brazilian Crush *62* spray, and omg, the mix of the 2 is an intoxicating scent. The smell of the 2 is like nothing you have smelled before. Warning ⚠️ you will literally be addicted lol."

If Burberry Her is a bit fruity for your taste, or you want something equally as amazing but a different vibe - I definitely recommend to try out goddess! It is seductive and in charge. The staying power is a 10 out of 10 as well. I feel so sexy wearing it, and my boyfriend commented on how much he liked it without being asked! Rave review from him! I can still smell it on my clothes, even after a long day of errands or shopping. This is an incentivized review in exchange for my honest opinion, and I do wholeheartedly love the scent! Another wonderful fragrance by Burberry💛"

Paired with this rich sweetness is the elegant notes of lavender that tone down the sweetness of the vanilla and add depth and curiosity. The lavender really give this fragrance some mystery. I have worn this every day since receivingit and have had many compliments. The scent profile is an elegant, classy daytime fragrance that lasts all day into the night.

I have actually been wearing this exclusively since receiving it as a VoxBox item and it's become my favorite warm scent. The ONLY reason I gave it 4-stars (and I considered giving it 3 actually) is that the scent lasts about a half day and then it becomes so light that you'd have to put your nose on your skin to smell it. So, for the price, it definitely need more lasting power. Maybe spraying on clothes would let it linger longer, but I don't want to risk damaging the fabrics I'm wearing. By far the scent of this is a 5-star scent though."

When I saw that there was vanilla in the ingredients I was positive I was gonna hate it. However! To my surprise the vanilla is not overpowering it graces the overall scent with lace blanket of vanilla giving it a hint but not taking over as the the star of the show. Its a great blend of the vanilla and whatever else is in it. Perhaps lavender I'll have to check later. Either way, this perfume gives me a pep in my step, and really makes me feel like woman, a goddess. I move different when I wear it, I feel like a literal ethereal baddie thats in her peace and unbothered. My partner loves the scent too. Personally, this will definitely be a go to for me in fav perfumes along with YSL Opium. If you do like that you'll probably love this.

Burberry Goddess is very elegant in the scent and bottle design. The vanilla caviar and warm vanilla make a light beautiful blend that lasts. One great thing to mention is the bottle is refillable!

It reminds me of HER mixed with Goddess. Don’t think this one suits my skin and overall preference of EDPs, but glad I received it and will use during the fall season."

			"review_text": "I received Burberry Goddess for free for testing purposes. That said, here are my thoughts:  The packaging is very pretty, with a gold label with black lettering. It looks high end. The bottle is elegant and classic. It’s well made, and fits in beautifully to my perfume collection. Outside the cold top and center, the bottle is transparent, which works nicely as the perfume itself is a pretty amber. From a sustainability standpoint, I appreciate that it’s reusable.  The scent is a warm, heady smell at first sprit, with vanilla and woodiness forward. As it wears, it fades more into a softer, sweeter vanilla scent. The woodiness gets subtler, but keeps the smell from being saccharine. It sort of reminds me of a grown-up, luxe version of a vanilla body spray I used as a teenager—it’s nostalgic for me, so I see that as a plus. The lavender notes are not particularly strong, so if you want a lavender-forward perfume, this may not be the best pick.  The scent is not overpowering at all. It gets fairly subtle after the top notes wear off, but lingers nicely. It’s pretty much gone after 5-6 hours, so you may want to reapply. I have pretty nasty allergies, and it doesn’t trigger them either which is a plus. About two spritzes on pulse points is plenty.  I have gotten multiple compliments on this one, which doesn’t happen to me too often—a guy who I was passing on my way into work told me I smelled amazing, so that’s a win!  I think this would make a nice gift, especially for someone whose scent preferences you aren’t familiar with, given how much of a crowdpleaser vanilla is generally."

Vanilla is such a classic scent and this Eau De Parfum is anything but usual! It’s lovely soft musk is still bright enough for summer but warm enough for fall and winter too! I’m a season fragrance lover and look forward to changing my fragrance with the seasons, but this one could easily carry you through all of them! The bottle is gorgeous with gold accents and the creamy vanilla color of the perfume. It does say that there is a hint of lavender but I don’t smell that at all which I actually am glad for!  The only thing I have to say about it is I wish the soft, elegant fragrance lasted a touch longer for me. Other than that, I’ve found myself reaching for Burberry Goddess every day!"
