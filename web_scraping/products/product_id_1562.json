			"review_text": "Basically, I'm not someone who uses a lot of skin products. I tend to want to squeeze out every little pimple or blackhead except that it leaves marks on my face. So I wanted to try a complete daily facial treatment to see if it would help me no longer touch my face constantly to remove every little imperfection. When I first applied the complete treatment, I felt like there was a thick layer on my face throughout the day and the lactic acid lotion made me somewhat itchy. After 1 week of use, I was surprised to notice that my skin was much smoother than at the start and the lactic acid lotion no longer had a tingling effect. I've been using the complete treatment every day for 1 month now and I LOVE IT! My complexion is brighter, I no longer even feel the products on my skin and the eye contour cream is my favorite. I don't even feel the need to put on makeup before going to work, I feel like my face is more illuminated and healthy after 1 month! I love it and I no longer touch my pimples and blackheads. I recommend 100%!"

My skin has never felt softer, more hydrated, and the texture/pores are significantly improved.

			"review_text": "My skin is fairly sensitive and dry. I used this nighttime and the morning routine religiously for a month. My skin erupted with deep, hard pimples on my cheeks and jawline. I have never had pimples on my cheeks in my entire life. I would develop at least one new pimple every day.  Once I stopped using it, the new pimples stopped popping up. I loved the smell and feel of the products but the natural scents reminded me of lush skin care which I can’t use because natural doesn’t mean gentle.  A lot of natural products are very harsh on sensitive skin. It’s a big no for me. Although it’s marketed for dry skin, I think it dried me out. Im very disappointed at how harsh this products are.  The eye cream was the absolute worse thing I have ever put near my eyes.  My eyes burned and my eye area has never looked more dry.  My eyes were red and irritated.  Floored that this is marketed for eyes."

I can't review that one but I can the rest of them.  I have seen significant improvement from using these products over time.  It wasn't right away but it is a buildable improvement.  I absolutely love the good genes - it is such a good product despite the slight sting.  The face oil doesn't feel heavy and so my face isn't glommed down with product.  I apply in the order i am supposed to but I do leave a couple of minutes in between each application to allow the product time to settle.  Such a good purchase,"
