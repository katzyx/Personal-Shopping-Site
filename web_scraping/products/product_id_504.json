			"review_text": "I absolutely love this body cream! I used it during my recoveries from two rounds of plastic surgery earlier this year‚Äîa tummy tuck, some lipo 360, a breast lift, fat transfer, and BBL‚Äî all in all, a ton of body contouring, and it was nothing short of a lifesaver. While I obviously didn‚Äôt use it on surgical wounds, it became an essential part of my routine for managing the intense swelling that comes with recovery on the lower half of my body while I used the lighter fenty line lotion on the upper half of my body (the lotion absorbs a little faster over sensitive adjacent regions during the lipo burning feeling, also highly recommended).   Swelling during recovery can really strain your skin, leading to dryness, irritation, and even fissures. This cream kept my skin thoroughly moisturized, soft, and resilient, even during the most challenging phases. It absorbed beautifully without feeling greasy, and I truly believe it helped prevent any skin issues while my body was under so much pressure.  If you‚Äôre undergoing a similar procedure, or if you simply need a deeply hydrating, skin-loving product, I can‚Äôt recommend this enough. It made all the difference in my recovery and left my skin feeling amazing. A must-have!"

The scent doesn't last, but the shimmer and the way it moisturizes do last. Also, a little bit of product goes a long way. For designer lotion, it's middle of the road for me, especially for the cost of the large size. I wouldn't buy it again."

I was a little disappointed that they decided to only make a tiny version this year, and brought out Toasted Marshmellow. I'm not sure if some have had a bad batch, or what? Mine does not smell like play-doh, or anything of the sort. What the scent reminds me of, is the Toasted Marshmellow from Bath and Body Works. I really do like this Toasted Marshmellow scent. It's not overpowering, the formula seems to be as shimmery as last year. I hope to stock up on this before it disappears."

It left me feeling really sticky, and the residue on my hands doesn't feel great. The scent isn't one I'm a fan of, either, it's kind of a generic fruity/fresh scent. Honestly it's reminding me a lot of drugstore body butters- it doesn't feel like a $50 product, and I'm a bit surprised that most of the other reviews are so great. I will say it doesn't pill up, which is my main gripe of cheaper lotions.  I got the holiday trio set, and I'll probably not return it because I would like to try the other 2 (cinnamon & vanilla) because I at least like the scent of those and maybe the shimmer formula will feel better? But I've been a pretty loyal Sol De Janiero user for many years, and far prefer their creams in any variety to the Fenty."

			"review_text": "I‚Äôve live in New England and have very dry skin. I typically use thicker products like cocoa butter, eucerine body lotion etc. but I wanted something a little more lux so I finally caved in and bought this. I was skeptical about the size/price of this but a little goes a long way, like another reviewer said you can make this stretch by applying on  damp skin.   This is very hydrating and my skin drinks this right up. It does leave a nice glow. In my opinion I don‚Äôt not feel greasy, my skin is hydrated enough to where I do not need to reapply throughout the day.   After a couple days of consistent use my skin is noticeably smoother and softer.  I‚Äôll use this for my winter body moisturizer and in the summer I think I would be able to use this every other day since it‚Äôs so hydrating orrrr I‚Äôll do something more lightweight like the fresh grapefruit body lotion daily.   If you struggle with dry skin and do not mind a thicker product, I definitely recommend trying this product. Rih did her thing! I wish it came in a value size. If you don‚Äôt like it, just return or exchange for another product within the return policy time frame."

The fragrance is light and fresh and the best part is that it does not clash with any perfume or other scented body products. I should mention that I'm a 57 year old women and my age had started to show in recent years.The thing that bothered me the most was the crepeness on the tops of my thighs.So we are a year in and my skin has been utterly transformed!!!!!!My skin looks and feels 20 years younger!!!!! Its soft and supple and after some dry down, my skin feels silky and looks soft and supple.  FENTY!! Please don't ever change the formula of this because I plan on using it for years to come and not only will I use it but I'll continue to recommend it to everyone!!

I ordered this lotion & another from Sephora. Tested both with and without adding an oil. The other lotion was awful, but this was heaven!  Using lotion by itself and with added oil, it helped keep my skin to hydrated and supple. The consistency was medium thick, went on smooth, soaked in without needing to rub to hard and the smell was divine! No rash or allergic reactions. The packaging was good too.  My only issues was though it soaked in well, I was still a little slick for mins after. Not greasy, but a min layer of moisture. Regardless, it eventually completely soaked in and didn't stain clothes. Other issue is the price. Super expensive for what I need daily.   I normally shy away from celebrity brands, but this was a game changer for my dry skin."

I never try body lotions/creams, because they never live up to the moisture and glow from my beloved childhood skin products.   Butta Drop is IT. This thicccccc cream literally melts into the skin. Leaves skin so soft and supple (for a long time) and has the most gentle of scents. It is quite pricey for the size, but honestly I think it‚Äôs worth it. Not for every day use in my mind: I use it as a treat/when I‚Äôm looking for a lift for events, going out, etc. Helps me justify the cost. Worth it. Perfect for your skin. Do it."

Cons:  - a little thick for my liking. I hate taking a long time to put on lotion this definitely isn‚Äôt the thickest but still a little too think for me.  - softens but does not offer extended moisture for really dry skin like mine if I don‚Äôt apply right away out of the shower my skin is so dry - not enough product for price ‚Äî overall pricey for a daily lotion  - doesn‚Äôt offer that skin softening effect like other cheaper old school Shea/Cocoa butter lotions  Overall I won‚Äôt be repurchasing because i don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs worth the money. Maybe if it was improved and the price point was a little lower. I guess I‚Äôd recommend if you don‚Äôt mind the thicker formula and the price."

When I run my hands over my skin, my hands look greasy because the lotion is just sitting on top. Maybe someone with drier skin than mine would do better with this."

I applied this right after my usual shower routine or after using the Buff Ryder scrub. This oil-rich cream softened and moisturized my skin well, making it supple and elastic. Unfortunately, after sometime, the skin felt borderline greasy. I like my moisturizers to get absorbed into the skin, which this doesn‚Äôt do. The oils just stayed on top of my skin and never really got absorbed. I was almost expecting this cream to leave a ‚Äòsweat mark‚Äô on my office chair (I know, gross!). Thankfully it didn‚Äôt, but that was the feeling I was getting every time I sat on my chair. Also, it‚Äôs supposed to have a tropical fragrance, but it‚Äôs barely noticeable. Not just on the skin, but even in the container, there was almost no fragrance. So I gave it a shot, but won‚Äôt be buying this again. There are other body creams in the market that are way more effective at a much cheaper price point."

When it does (10-15 min maybe?‚Ä¶my skin is normal to dry, but not flakey). If you use too much, I could see it turning into a slip and slide type situation but a small amount is wonderful.

			"review_text": "I was hesitant to try Fenty Skin in general despite loving everything else Rihanna does, but I decided to buy this randomly and I'm so happy I did!  The oil cream is sooo silky and smooth and has a ton and I mean a ton of staying power.   My dry eczema prone skin drank this up (I do not have an outbreak now just mentioned for skin type comparison) and I was soft for nearly an entire day before reapplying. I'm curious if there are long term  benefits to this because I really like the way I feel and I hope it lasts.  It's also a great massage cream. my boyfriend enjoyed it very much and he usually hates the feeling of lotions.  I took a star off because I feel like it should have come with an applicator and for the price I think it could be bigger, but I'm still going to repurchase. A tube version that's more travel friendly would be cool too."

The best though, is about 6 to 8 hours after spplication, my skin is incredibly smooth and baby soft.  Worth every penny of the price."
