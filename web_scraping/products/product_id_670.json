			"review_text": "The price point is the main draw at $60 for a mini name brand collection set, the store didn‚Äôt have any of these scents to smell before purchasing which was a gamble. However, these scents can be best compared to gaps 2010s collection. The orange scent was the most appealing but wouldn‚Äôt recommend some paying that price just for the brand name that smells like low grade mall toilette"

			"review_text": "Gorgeous product. While I didn't love all four scents in the set, the ones I did like were classy, sophisticated scents that could be reapplied throughout the day without becoming overwhelming. I was also very pleased with the product value; the mini bottles are so beautiful, would make cute curio pieces once the perfum is finished, and this set is a great way to sample high end perfume without committing to a full bottle before being ready to. This would make a great gift for a perfume lover and Hermes fan!"

It is a great way to test different kinds of perfumes. The only reason it‚Äôs not 5 stars is because they‚Äôre a lot smaller than what the product photos made it look like."

I didn't love all the scents, but a couple of them really stood out and became my new favorite (as in, if I would buy the full size bottle) - which is exactly the purpose of these smaller sizes. In comparison do other luxury scents, I was very pleased with this"
