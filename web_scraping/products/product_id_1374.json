			"review_text": "I included two photos: The one with makeup and a headband is after using my regular aerosol spray, and the close up one with no makeup is after using this product. I am unimpressed to be honest. No matter how much I use it doesn't prevent my hair from having that separated look. I tried massaging this into my bangs throughout the day and at the end of the day you can still see the grains. The smell is very minimal though and it goes away after it's applied to the hair which I like quite a bit. It has a sliding plastic sheath that goes over the brush so it's easy to put the cap on (like a retractable Kabuki brush) so I'm not positive the reviews saying it's hard to put the cap on know that it has that feature (or maybe it was recently added). You also do not open the bottle and dip the brush in the product– you simply just invert the brush, tap it into your hair, and the powder comes from the canister through the bristles, no disassembly required. Overall it's a nice idea but up close it looks like I have dandruff and no amount of massaging makes the grains disappear. It's a no for me."

I have dark auburn/warm brown hair and it was leaving a whit cast on my hair until I realized it was my own fault because I kept forgetting to twist the product so no more was coming out. Now I twist open tap a couple times then twist closed way better. Still slight cast but it cleaned without residue and wasn't too obvious. NOW here is a trick I found for dark hair people out there. I used my colorwow hair filler and scrapped it into the powder pot and shook it really well to blend....Zero white cast and a filled in hair line!"

The packaging is simple and effective. The brush makes it easy to apply through my roots. The only reason I took away one star is due to the powder not being easy to blend into my dark hair. This product has saved me on days where my head gets a bit oily and I want to push one more day before wash day. It gave my hair a little bit of volume and feels nice to touch. I’ve been keeping it in my pool/ beach bag. Would definitely do a refill of this product."

But be wary, then you take the lid off, quite a bit of product will be on the brush and in the lid. The fragrance is really clean and refreshing. The color of the powder is an off-white beige shade, not sure if I’d reccomend for dark hair. It works well. Leaves a bit of a residue but does absorb oil. After two weeks of regular use, I didn’t notice a detoxifying effect but other than that I enjoyed it"

I love the applicator because the brush is soft and gentle so it easily gets to the base of my hair. It also doesn’t over apply, the powder comes out pretty sparingly so I can measure it rather than over apply and get too much. I noticed using my fingers to rub in the powder around the roots gave the best results because it left no sign of shampoo and it gave me extra volume.

I apply it directly on the scalp, let it work for a bit (or overnight) and brush the excess in the morning. It does not make my scalp itchy and it gives my hair a nice refresh. Highly recommend!"

There’s no real clear instructions on the box or the product itself, so that’s one thing that could be improved on. Although rather straight forward, I wanted to be certain i was doing it right. The packaging is cute, compact, and innovative. I found it difficult to get the powder to come out evenly unless the bottle was perfectly straight upside down. Once applied, it did absorb some of the oiliness in my hair and i liked the cooling sensation from the peppermint. It definitely gave me some volume, but I could definitely feel it in my hair almost like a texturing powder feeling if you know what i mean. I have dark blonde hair and it left my scalp looking a little chalky, which was okay since my hairs light enough, but if you have darker hair i could see this being an issue. Overall a nice product to have as i think it will be more cost effective in the long run once you get the hang of the powder form."

Enter Rootist Clarify Dry Shampoo Powder, and suddenly it’s like an instant wash in a bottle. Where did the oil, sweat, and tears go? Who knows! But they can stay gone, that’s for sure. This dry shampoo gives my hair a fresh, clean feel and look, banishing any trace of greasiness. It’s super easy to apply, blends in perfectly without leaving any residue, and leaves my hair feeling light and refreshed. Plus, it has a lovely scent that’s not overpowering but just enough to keep my hair smelling fresh.

When I saw this product, I was really excited because it seemed like a great idea. However, the execution kind of sucks. You really have to work to get the dry shampoo onto your hair. I wasn't able to get enough on, and especially for the ends of my hair, it was difficult. After working on my roots, my stands especially the ends looked greasy. It takes quite a bit of effort to get the powder onto your hair. I understand why aerosol dry shampoo is so popular; a couple of sprays and you're done. This product, however, makes the process tedious. I wish they had put it in a container where you could dip a brush in yourself—that would’ve been amazing. Overall, the dry shampoo itself is fine. Your hair looks okay, and the smell isn’t as strong as some dry shampoos, which I appreciate. But it's really hard to get enough product out for your hair to look clean. Maybe this would work if you used it the day after washing your hair to extend the clean look. But if you try it once your hair starts to look greasy, it’s more effort than it’s worth. And for those who are wondering I have straight fine hair. I don’t normally look greasy until three days after washing my hair. The only reason I will recommend it is because it does not use aerosol."

			"review_text": "I love The Rootist Clarify Dry Shampoo Powder for several reasons. Firstly, its innovative packaging with a built-in brush makes it incredibly easy to apply precisely where it’s needed, ensuring minimal waste and maximum control. This feature sets it apart from traditional aerosol dry shampoos, which often lack precision and can leave a noticeable residue.  The product itself is a standout due to its high-quality, talc-free formulation. It uses Rootbiomic Ferment, a blend of fermented roots, mushrooms, and vitamins, which not only absorbs oil and sweat effectively but also promotes a healthy scalp environment  . Additionally, the inclusion of magnesium carbonate and allantoin helps to manage oil and keep the scalp hydrated without disrupting its natural balance ."

As someone with wavy, medium-thick hair, finding a dry shampoo that works well without leaving a white cast can be challenging, but this product delivers perfectly. From the first application, I noticed how effectively it absorbs oil and sweat, both instantly and throughout the day. My hair feels clean and soft, and I love that it doesn't disrupt my scalp balance or build up in my hair. The ferment-infused formula seems to be really gentle and beneficial for my scalp. The application process is straightforward and mess-free. The non-aerosol, refillable packaging is perfect for on-the-go use, and the precision brush makes it easy to apply directly to my roots. After tapping the powder onto my roots, I simply massage it in with my fingertips, and it blends seamlessly without any residue. I also appreciate the clean ingredient list, free of talc and packed with natural extracts. Overall, The Rootist Clarify Dry Shampoo Powder has been a game-changer for keeping my hair fresh between washes, especially after workouts. Highly recommend!"

That was my mistake, not the product itself. I do like the idea it comes with a brush to take off excess dry shampoo you might leave instead of your hands.

A very convenient applicator includes a brush that makes it very convenient to apply and distribute dry shampoo throughout your head. The smell is very pleasant with slightly minty notes. After application, you need to massage a little at the roots of the head with gentle movements. Thanks to this, you will see how the fat content at the roots begins to disappear and volume increases. After using this shampoo, the hair looks healthier and the volume at the hair roots increases. The feeling of incredible freshness and lightness will not leave you throughout. It is also very convenient to use this dry shampoo after training in the gym. A very compact and reliable assistant. I recommend this super shampoo to every girl."

A healthy scalp is my top talking point when it comes to many clients creating a healthy hair care regimen. I inform customers that a healthy scalp will indeed help them on their journey to having healthy hair. Hair care is a process that requires you to have different products and routines that will give your hair the best results. It has been scientifically proven that a healthy scalp plays an integral role in achieving healthy hair growth.  As a proud member of the curly hair community my regimen over the last 10yrs+ has changed based on my hair and scalp needs. I have fine curly hair with a medium density plus I sweat excessively in my scalp regularly. I began to use The Rootist Dry Shampoo Powder on the days I worked out and to my surprise it refreshed my hair perfectly. It removed the excess oil from my scalp and hairline allowing me the ability to restyle my hair with ease. I used the product two times a week by lightly brushing the dust where needed.  This product removed the excess oil in my scalp and hair strands which allowed me the opportunity to fluff my hair from the roots and give my hair the volume I love. I would recommend this product to anyone who is looking for a dry shampoo. It didn’t leave a residue or white flakes on my hair which was an added plus. It also is compact and easily fits in my gym bag."

As a beauty professional, I am always on the lookout for products that not only deliver results but also prioritize the health of the hair. This dry shampoo powder exceeded my expectations in both regards.  Firstly, the talc-free formula is a game-changer. It effectively absorbs excess oil from the roots without leaving any white residue, a common issue with many dry shampoos on the market. The lightweight powder blends seamlessly into the hair, providing an instant refresh without compromising on texture or volume. It's perfect for those days when you need a quick pick-me-up but don't want to sacrifice the natural feel of your locks.  What sets the Rootist Dry Shampoo apart is its clarifying properties. The purifying ingredients not only absorb oil but also detoxify the scalp, leaving it feeling revitalized and clean. It's a fantastic option for individuals with oily or sensitive scalps, providing a refreshing sensation without causing irritation.  The packaging is also worth mentioning. The applicator allows for precise application, ensuring that the product is distributed evenly at the roots. The sleek design makes it easy to carry in my beauty kit, making it a convenient solution for on-the-go touch-ups.  In terms of fragrance, the Rootist Dry Shampoo has a subtle and pleasant scent that isn't overpowering. It leaves the hair smelling fresh without clashing with any other fragrances you may be wearing.  Overall, the Rootist Talc Free Dry Shampoo Powder Clarify Purifier has earned a permanent spot in my beauty routine. Its talc-free formula, clarifying properties, and convenient packaging make it a standout product in the realm of dry shampoos. I highly recommend it to both clients and fellow beauty professionals looking for an effective and scalp-friendly solution."

Cons: I didn’t love how it made my hair feel - kind of gritty/dirty, though that’s personal preference and a feature that is hard to avoid with dry shampoo products. This also made my sensitive scalp itchy, which is my personal experience with certain scalp products, but would probably be fine for someone without such sensitivity.

Because of this, I was so excited to try The Rootist, especially their dry shampoo.  I absolutely love and swear by dry shampoo, specifically because using a product like this can prolong hair color and can preserve dry brittle hair. But, this was the first time I had experienced a dry shampoo delivery system with a brush.  Immediately, I was sold!  I love having a brush to deliver the powder at my roots because it allowed for accurate application and a built-in brush to work the product through my hair.  I have found with a spray dry shampoo, my scalp gets flakier and although the oil is gone, my hair still looks dirty.  I noticed with this powder that was not the case and my hair was able to have that clean shine without my scalp suffering. I do wish there was a way to fully use the brush without adding more powder, but not enough to cause me to stop using this amazing dry shampoo.  I also love the size of The Rootist’s dry shampoo, it is perfect for traveling and the price point cannot be beat!"

I can see how others would love it but I don't care for the way it left my hair thick and icky feeling. It just wasn't for me. But, that doesn't mean that it won't be amazing for others!"

It definitely is more modern and fresh. I was expecting more volume or more of a just washed effect than what it provided but overall, I would recommend."

			"review_text": "As someone who only washes her hair maybe 6 times a month, I live and breathe dry shampoo! This one is super handy, as it is lightweight and portable, therefore very convenient for tossing in my gym bag or purse for on-the-go touch-ups. I also appreciate that it is talc-free... my scalp doesn't get itchy, and I don't have to mess with other undesirable side effects of that frequently used ingredient. I dig the brush applicator too because it helps me spread the product diffusely and lightly dust area without having to worry about applying too much powder. A no-brainer for the busy gal."

			"review_text": "I have been using The Rootist dry shampoo powder for a few weeks now and I am very impressed with the results. It is easy to apply, just brush  some on your roots and massage it in with your fingers or brush. It instantly absorbs oil and dirt, leaving my hair feeling fresh and clean. It also adds volume and texture to my fine, limp hair, making it look more lively and bouncy. The best part is that it does not leave any white residue or make my hair feel dry or stiff. It has a subtle, pleasant scent that is not overpowering or artificial. I love that it is made with natural ingredients like rice starch, baking soda, and biotin, which nourish and strengthen my hair. It is also vegan, cruelty-free, and free of sulfates, parabens, and phthalates. The bottle is cute and convenient, and a little goes a long way. As a skincare expert, I would definitely recommend this product to anyone looking for a natural, effective, and affordable dry shampoo powder."

The brush application makes it so easy to apply in the area I need it most & I don’t have to worry about inhaling an aerosol spray. Also like that it doesn’t take much product so it should last longer than normal spray dry shampoo!"

I am also someone who works out a lot and I often try to extend the time between washes for hair health and to be able to style in between washes. This powder makes it really easy to do so and has helped to keep my hair from looking oily and greasy. What I love the most is the applicator it makes it really easy to target places that you need the dry shampoo and stops it from spreading to places you don’t need. Super easy to use and very efficient. Quickly and easily takes all the oiliness look away! Love it!"

			"review_text": "When I opened the package of the root ist dry shampoo powder, there was a lot of product on the brush. If I decide to take this dry shampoo on a trip, it will have me worried to know container could get open and make a mess. The powder does what it is supposed to do. I applied a little bit around my scalp and it absorbed the oils, blended great with my hair and there was no white residue. Product has a minty scent and is amazing but packaging needs work. I wish the brush would of have like a twist to make the brush together and place the cap on top easier."

			"review_text": "Well, I'll admit, I don't tend to use a lot of hair products, besides my already go to items. Because I dye my hair all types of crazy colors, so I can't afford to mess up anything that will either wash away my crazy colors or cause buildup on my scalp. I do have an oily scalp, and figured this would in extending the time in-between the days I wash my hair and don't.  (I don't wash my hair everyday) to be frank, this dry shampoo made my hair feel stiff. The application process is effortless, the brush is nice and smooth. The residue on the hair is minimal, which is a plus. I'm definitely not crazy about it though. Perhaps my hair/heard aren't the best for this type of product. I do recommend trying it out, if you have an oily scalp, who knows, it might work for you!"
