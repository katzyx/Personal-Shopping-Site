			"review_text": "The perfect bronzer and blush palette for light-fair skin tones. Me and my sister are two different shades, her skin tone is more darker-olive, she hates how the blush looked on her, but it think it looked quite nice on my skin. Nevertheless if this is a palette you been eyeing down. Get it! Itâ€™s worth it for the price or even a nice gift for the holidays :) shipping took 2 weeks to get here"
