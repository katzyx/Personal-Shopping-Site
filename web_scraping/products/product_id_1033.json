			"review_text": "This is a beautiful set, and a great deal.  I really enjoy this perfume and the sweet and smoky combination. This is so perfect for fall. Highly recommend to anyone who enjoys gourmand scents with a bit of smokiness.  The smoky note is not overwhelming. This really does remind me of sitting out by a campfire, roasting marshmallows, and all of the fall goodness. I wish there were body butters or lotions to layer with it.  I enjoy layering it with the Bath and Body Works Bonfire Bash shower gel and body cream."

			"review_text": "To the reviewer below me, the value of the set is $139. A 30ml bottle is $85, 10ml spray is $35, and a 7.5ml mini is between $15-20. You save $20 if you were to buy all 3 separately. My husband and teenage son, both really like this fragrance, and I like it it too, it just smells differently on them. The 30ml is great for my husband. The 10ml is great for my 15yo, and the dabber is perfect for me. If you have a similar situation, the value is great."
