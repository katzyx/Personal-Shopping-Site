My long time Aveda dual powder that I used for years is no longer available (due to discontinued - really Aveda why? ) and I am lost at what to replace it with.  I usually used two Aveda dual powders that fit side by side in a compact holder (lighter for under eyes and darker for my face) but thinking the shade I got would work under eyes and go a shader up for face but I am still trying to figure out to return or repurchase a darker shade as well.  I really didn't like the last of the powder, and it left a shine halfway through the day.  Then  I would have two compacts.  If anyone used to use Aveda please let me know what you have made a switch to."

However, it did work well for me as a dry powder over foundation.  Maybe I needed a darker shade but I won't buy this product again, especially not for $50.

			"review_text": "I had high expectations since there were so many good reviews, but honestly was very disappointed.  Just for background, I am in my 20s, have a VERY oily nose, and normal skin everywhere else.   First, as soon as I open the box, the scent of baby powder was SO strong. I applied one side with a brush, and the other using the sponge it came with.   PROS: -After 5 minutes, I did notice my pores were gone, all blurred.  CONS: -The scent started to give me a headache. It doesn't wear off until an hour after application  -Both sides (sponge & brush) barley had coverage. The sponge offered a little more coverage, but still barely any. -The product was nearly gone after an hour and a half.  -The product did bunch around my nostril areas  Overall, this product seems more like a setting powder rather than a FOUNDATION powder. I would not even call this a foundation powder. So if you're looking for a product that will blur pores, set your liquid foundations, this is perfect. But if you're like me, looking for a quick powder foundation to apply when in a rush, or going to a place you just want a quick natural fix-up, this is NOT the one for you."

There is a light scent when it is first applied but that goes away within a few minutes. There are so many shades to choose from so you are sure to find your perfect skin tone match."

It doesn't cling to dry patches, both powder and cream products blend beautifully on top and a light mist of setting spray keeps it looking great for at least 7 hrs.  There is a slight floral fragrance but I don't notice it after application and it's never irritated my ultra sensitive and reactive skin.  In terms of shade matches, although 90 and 100 have the same level of lightness, I prefer the slightly cool undertone of 100 to the true neutral of 90.  I can't recommend this enough and think it will work on a variety of skin types. **For reference, I'm 41 with combo dry skin and my best foundation matches are MAC NW10, Estee Lauder DW in 1C0 Shell, YSL All Hours in BR10 and Fenty 120"

Unfortunately, I don't think I'll be able to. The price tag is so big I'll definitely have to go through the hassle of returning it. Pretty bummed, I love it so much, its just the smell! :("

I use the included pad to apply over my primer, and I let it set for 3-5 minutes before brushing off any additional product.

I use spreading motions for basic all over coverage (even a perfect base for eyes!) and a blotting motion with the sponge on little spots that need extra concealing.

This product sounded promising (I was only going to use it dry), but it ended up being Okay at best. If you have flawless skin, or use it as a finishing/setting powder after your regular foundation, this may be enough coverage for you... It wasn’t for me. It’s far too pricy to still want more after I’m done piling it on. I also didn’t care for the scent - while not obnoxious, it lingered most of the day, and I could do without that. I returned and exchanged for BarePro."

It's hard for me to find a product that perfectly matches my skintone and has the right amount of coverage to use over tinted moisturizer, and in that regard this fit the bill.   But... I actively avoid using this product because the scent is SO off-putting and strong. It doesn't go away, in fact if anything it lingers ALL DAY, to the point that when I wear it I find myself self-consciously paying attention to people I interact with for signs that they can smell it, too.   If there were a non-scented version of this, I'd be a customer for life. But as it stands, this will be relegated to the bottom of my makeup bag with the broken eyeshadows and stubs of liner pencils, where it belongs. Bleugh."

Far superior to any other powder foundation. It's buildable, provides good coverage, and I'm fair with pink undertones;  I have a lot of redness and blotchiness that needs covering. Where this product is superior however is its staying power. I apply twice per day, and it takes me right through the evening hours with no touch ups. The colour matching is superb (and really true to life on Sephora's site), and the scent is signature Lancôme. This is my new go-to daily foundation and I highly recommend it as an lighter alternative to liquid foundation."

It provides even, smooth coverage, feels weightless, does not clog my pores or cause any breakouts (i am prone to breakouts). Does not look thick or heavy (my husband often thinks i am not wearing any makeup at all). Goes on matte and leaves me shine free for majority of the day. It looks very natural. I love it!!"

I had extremely oily skin and this powder would contain my oil for a good part of the day without a primer, without a matte foundation. Now that I’m on acne medication, my skin is more combo and the Dual Finish still works like a dream. It does not cling to my dry spots in the winter, nor does it break apart in the humid summer months. I will say it’s NOT sweat proof (but what is). On weekends, I use Dual Finish as a finishing powder over my foundation and translucent powder and it does not look cakey. It sits beautifully on the skin. I highly recommend Dual Finish for anyone of any skin type."

Before application and after skincare I do blot away any residual moisture so I don't experience the cakey face look. Doesn't enhance my enlarged pores which is a plus because I don't like relying on primer. My only complaint.....the fragrance! It doesn't dissipate after application. It lingers for several hours on the skin which is annoying. It doesn't make me ill but I imagine it bothering someone sensitive to fragrance (pregnant beauties, those with asthma). I wish they made it with it because it's so incredibly loud."

However, I have to confess that I quite like the scent, if only because it's tied to the nostalgia I feel because this product was my very first high end purchase. I was eighteen, and before this product I was only using drugstore items. This powder was a major milestone for me, and when I put it on for the first time I immediately felt grown up, (the geriatric fragrance kind of helped - ha!) I have since used many, many other kinds of powders on the market and have loved many of them, but decided to come back to this one for old times sake. My skin is oily in the T-zone, and this powder doesn't do much at all to control that. If you have dry skin, this product will be terrific for setting your foundation without looking cakey."

I went into Sephora to do a color match & the girl did a great job assessing my skin & my preferences by asking a lot of questions. And she used the color ID tool which said I have a lot of yellow in my skin. My favorite has always been powder foundations--I hate the way liquid foundations feel & look on me, even tinted moisturizers or BB/CC creams. I have very oily skin & bad acne. So after trying many different shades in many different brands, this is what we landed on. One shade just blended right in, we couldn't even see it whereas other formulas showed up as orangey streaks on my jawline. This line of powder foundation has soooo many shade choices, it's great!  The scent, I must say, is really overwhelming. It smells like powdery old lady perfume. But I will try to ignore that since it blends in so well. The scent goes away & the coverage lasts pretty well for me. I unfortunately have to wear medical masks at work because I'm a nurse so no matter what foundation & blush I wear, it will inevitably come off on those masks but this one seems to do ok or at least better than some others.   It is not a good formula for concealing. I have tried it on some dark post-acne spots & it does not conceal effectively so it's a somewhat sheer formula, only able to blur minor flaws & even out your skin tone. I have to use a thick concealer first then dab this lightly all over afterward using my beauty blender. It can sometimes look a little too powdery at first, but it eventually melts right in & looks smooth.  I use oil-control cleansers, oil-control toner, matte formula moisturizer, topical acne prescriptions & Benefit primer plus this product as my foundation & this seems to be a great combination for my oily skin. I will continue to use this since it has proven to be a perfect match for my skin tone as opposed to other products either looking too pale or too orange for my fair skin. It looks like it will last forever too."

I love MUFE Duo Mat 178 for setting, but this I can actually use as foundation and it looks flawless and natural as if I used a medium/full coverage liquid. When I'm lazy or in a rush, I can use this alone (over a primer/spf/moisturizer), put on some lips and feel beautiful. You can truly build it from sheer to medium/full.

I started wearing Lancome Dual Finish powder foundation almost 20 years ago, when I was a greasy, zitty 13-year-old, and it worked wonderfully without making my skin worse. Now, I am a super dry-skinned, zit-free 32-year-old, and it still works great! Having had my skin on both extreme ends of the spectrum (from extremely oily to extremely dry), I can honestly say that this works well for both skin types, from my experience.  When you first apply this powder foundation, it is going to look slightly powdery, and the coverage seems to be medium. However, once five minutes have passed, the foundation will have warmed up against your skin and melts into the skincare products that you applied beforehand, giving you the most beautiful, smooth, full yet natural coverage ever, without any of the powdery appearance.  This powder foundation is scented with the classic, powdery perfume scent (think baby powder), but I find it beautiful and something about the scent just makes the product feel more elegant to me.  I'm also impressed by the wide shade selection, which consists of tones that are realistic. I love this powder foundation and have used it through my teens, 20s, and now 30s."

			"review_text": "This is one of the best powders I've used! It was a bit difficult to get a color match, but that's true for my olive undertone skin with any face powder/foundation products. I settled with Sand III (I'm a Tawny in ELDW for reference), after trying it in Ecru, Honey and Amande. It's not a full coverage foundation powder like Make Up Forever's Duo Mat or Too Faced's Cocoa Powder Foundation, but with a solid tinted moisturizer or bb cream coverage, this powder works its magic. The powdery finish it gives creates a soft-focus over my face, although my natural oils do seep out through the day. While it's not a product that controls oils, I love the fact that you get double the amount of product in this compact compared to the standard amount you get with face powders from any other brand. It means I can touch up as often as I want without worrying about the product running out too soon! It is light enough in coverage to not cake up with multiple touch ups I find. I have only used it dry, because the only time I tried it wet it created a weird discoloration over the pan of powder, which kind of ruined my compact. So I haven't really tried a full coverage look with this powder, but even when it's dry I find that it's quite build-able and can cover broken capillaries and redness well, but not my acne scars or dark circles under my eyes. I use a concealer to cover those, but I end up having to do this when using pretty much any other product.  It's just such a classic product! I love seeing it sitting pretty on top of my vanity. Something about it screams 'timeless' to me. Even the fragrance in the product that seems to raise red flags, is something reminiscent of a time when such things were in vogue. While the scent is quite strong, I find it very pleasant and it doesn't irritate my skin or anything. I'm glad I found a color that I'm comfortable with and feel so good using it as part of my daily routine. Love love!"

It does have a kind of old lady makeup scent, but once I got used to it I couldn't really tell anymore, doesn't bother me at all. Using it as a finishing touch, it does set my makeup and help to keep the shine off my face. However, in the late afternoon, sometimes when I reapply it, it cakes just a little bit around my nose. But I think that's probably due to my skin being a bit dry by then, so I do have to kind of even it out with my fingers or tissue. May help if used with a mist or something.

Let me tell you, this was the best purchase I have made in a while. Not only is my skin pretty much acne free (occasional breakout here and there) but this actually does what it says. I apply dry over a tinted moisturized for a light, natural look and it looks gorgeous. When I want to spot correct or have a little more coverage, I simply wet my brush with my Urban Decay setting spray, give it a few dabs in the powder and apply. The coverage is great, but still feels like I'm wearing very little makeup at all and it looks natural. Not to mention, it will last ALL DAY. Only on really hot days to I have to give myself a little refresh in the afternoon. It does have a strong, somewhat old lady-like smell, but it fades fast and you get used to it. I highly recommend this product!"

I do notice that if I use a mattifying primer I tend to get less oily throughout the day. I use this with a nice quality Kabuki brush and apply it in swirling motions. It's build-able coverage as well so I dab a bit more on blemishes, etc. and it NEVER looks caked on. This has never caused me any skin problems and I'm very prone to breakouts and harsh ingredients.

That's the beauty of it though. If I want to wear it alone, I use a concealer and this over the top (use the sponge for a more full coverage or a brush if you want a little more medium type coverage). It is beautiful like that for every day. If you want a really full, perfect face, use this over the top of your foundation as a setting powder. Literally EVERY imperfection will be covered. I like to buy this in the fragrance-free version when possible. I do think Lancome tends to over-fragrance things sometimes. Overall though, this really is the best powder I have ever used. I can't believe this is the first time I have ever written a review on it considering I've been using it for over 10 years. This is great for normal/oily/combination skin. I have no experience with dry skin but I'm sure with the right moisturizer this will work for you too.

By far that was their best foundation, although a little gimacky with the vibrating applicator. Sadly that was discontinued, but this is the next best thing. It feels great, very light and provides just the right amount of coverage. It is a bit pricy though since it only last a couple of months (tops) and unfortunately hasn't SPF, but it's still a great product.

She works for the brand and was extremely helpful in shade selection. I can honestly say I've never had a powder match so flawlessly. I wear Buff II and it is virtually impossible to see on my skin. It blends beautifully over liquid foundation with little effort. I wear it in combination with Estee Lauder Double Wear and get excellent coverage and long wear out of this duo! I didn't notice the scent in store but did the second I got home and panicked thinking it was going to be awful and ruin the product for me but I was wrong!

I was weary, to say the least. I always found that powders made every line and hair (hey, we all have them!) super visible. She put it on me and I was hating it. HATING IT. Then she spritz some UD setting spray...and my face was FLAWLESS. The powdered settled on my skin and it looked amazing.  I bought it and on my way home I was thinking I would probably return it. Well, I haven't. I'm a convert. I get complimented on my skin (my skin, not my makeup) every single day. And no touch ups. At all.  I'm taking away one star because without setting spray, this wouldn't work for me. Also because it says you can use wet, but I haven't figured out how yet. It just gives the powder that dried up film on the top. I find a brush works best.  Also of note, this product is super fragranced. It's powdery and flowery, which I happen to like (it makes me feel like an old timey actress), but if you are averse to scents, you might want to skip it."

Although its a powder, it feels creamy, which is great for my dry skin.  I don't wear it on its own but I use it to set all my foundations and tinted moisturizers and it never EVER looks cakey like many other powder foundations. Also, my skin is quite dry but this powder never looks powdery or clings to dry patches.  I'm sad they discontinued the fragrance free version, but I don't mind the scent, which is lovely. I just don't think fragrance is necessary in cosmetics, but that's just me. If you've got dry skin, but prefer a semi-matte finish and are looking for a good setting powder, stop by your local sephora or department store and give this a try. Highly recommended and I will never go without 2 or 3 shades in my makeup stash!"

I have to hold my breath when I use it. I don't want to waste this product because it works so well. I probably will finish it up.

I'm giving it 4 stars because of the fragrance. When I first started using it, I did find the fragrance very off putting - quite frankly, it smells like an old lady. However, it started to not bother me as I continued to use it, and you can't smell it once it's applied. However, I am still of the mindset that your powder does not need to have a scent...just saying."

It looks a little too powdery when first applied, yet it has mineral oil in it so your skin gets greasy pretty fast. It is heavily fragranced too, though you can get the fragrance-free version on the Lancome website I believe.  Though there are a range of colors, I have trouble finding a good match for my light skintone. The shades in the 1 range are too light and the 2 range is too deep. Most of the colors are peachy or pink. I can't find one that is a true neutral. Even Matte neutrale (the most neutral) is still peachy on me.  Make Up For Ever's Duo Matte powder foundation is just a million times better than this - much more natural finish, better coverage, better at keeping oil away, and nice colors."

For more coverage, I have used it with a denser brush like a kabuki. I have also applied this lightly over tinted moisturizer. it does give me a matte look, but without making it too dry I which it made my skin itch. I work long hours (10+) and it doesn't need much touch up. I can also wear this powder foundation with primer or none. I highly recommended this, as there are so many uses to it.

I am new with make up, so I did my research on Sephora to see which powder foundation has high ratings and read reviews on the cons/pros. I decided to use this for my first powder, and I do not regret my decision at all. The price is a bit pricy but since Lancôme is a high product company, I thought $40. isn't that bad. When you open the product the outside is a beautiful plastic black with the gold near the opening, it looks very classy The product does come with a small flat circle soft sponge material to pick up the powder and a nice big mirror on top to use. I have darker skin than most asians so I got the Matte Wheat II. The product does stay for a long time (I have oily skin especially near my nose). It not only looks great but it smells wonderful too. The powder does not come off too easily when you pick it up which is a great factor, if you are scared the powder will get everywhere. I can't wait to buy more once I use all of mine."

I was intrigued with the idea of using a powder compact as foundation eliminating the need for regular liquid foundation. I admit I have yet to try using it with a moist puff, but I did simply try it as foundation by using it directly on my moisturized skin. The coverage was excellent, however, at my age (64), I found it accentuated some wrinkles especially near my eyes. So, I need to be careful where I apply it. Now I put some on the apples of my cheeks, nose, jawline, temples. forehead, and the middle of my chin, but avoid my eye region, laugh lines, and marionette lines (boohoo--wish I had a slight facelift to soften the latter two areas.) It looks smooth and silky when I'm done. I also apply it with a very light touch in the same spots when I where my Clinique BB cream when we're going out in the evening. I think it looks great and it lasts all day &/or night without any touchups. I have combination skin with classic T-zone oiliness though in winter it's minor. The color is a perfect match for my fair skin (the lightest one). I'm going to get another one to keep in my purse--Bravo Lancome."

This can be used over a good quality facial moisturizer to prevent your skin from drying out- just make sure the moisturizer dries first or you could have streaking of the powder and you also make the powder stick to the powder puff applicator.

This product is terrific because it is buildable in coverage (all the way up to full), lasts all day (12+ hours), does not settle into lines, does not cake, and has a really wide shade range. I'm very fair complected, and I've always had to blend my foundation past my jawline because my neck is so pale. Not anymore!

I gave it 4 stars because its not super covering (although ive never tried it wet), but i figured it wouldn't be since i dont want it to be obvious im wearing something. even though it's a tad pricey, ive had mine for over 6 months and its not finishing any time soon. i use a big brush to apply and have occasionally used the one included. i too love the smell and have always trusted lancome with good products for my skin."

I KNOW there's an abundance of amazing powders out there, so I decided to go into my local Sephora. For $40, I demand amazing coverage at least for 5 hours.  I suggest going into your Sephora and trying this powder because everyone's skin is different. What works for your skin, may not work for mine and so on.  My Sephora consultant recommended Laura Mercier. As soon as she sampled it on my face, I was sold! I felt so weird breaking up with Lancome, but we'll still see each other...as their mascara is amazing."

It smells HORRID! I do not understand why people think this smells good. It smells like an older, much much older woman. I cannot stand the smell. Last, it is not long wearing, likely due to my oiliness which was not at all controlled by this powder.

The possibilities are absolutely endless with this powder - it can be used wet or dry (depending on coverage needs) as a foundation, though I personally prefer using it dry as a good coverage foundation. Truly, the best part is that it doubles as a pressed powder with a MATTE FINISH - so if you tend to get oily it will help to control mid-day shine!

On the lancome website they sell both scented and unscented versions, but I can't seem to find the unscented on the Sephora website. If you don't like powdery-smells or scent bothers you, I wouldn't recommend this. I'm going to return it and give the unscented version a try."

Therefore I would not recommend using this as a blotting powder. I do have combination skin with an awfully oily t-zone, normal cheeks, and very dry skin around the mouth area. Yes, my skin is a nightmare to deal with. On my oily areas, this powder does not hold up too long, maybe 2-3 hours. It's perfect on my normal cheeks. But the dry areas around my mouth and on my jawline become extremely flaky and with the color of the foundation, the flakes are even more pronounced. I do apply heaps of moisturizer (a very thick and creamy moisturizer I might add) beforehand and my skin is just fine but this powder soaks up any moisture I have there. I do still like this powder, I find using a primer helps a lot. I like the rosy smell. I do not use the puff provided, I use a blush brush for lighter application and more of a natural finish even over foundation to set. I would repurchase."

			"review_text": "This product is insanely great. I have very interesting skin-- some days it's bone dry, other days it is shiny. Sometimes my skin looks so clear I am tempted to wear no makeup, and other days I have a wild break out. I can honestly say I have come back to this powder and have loved it in all of these circumstances for years!!! It is amazing!  It comes with two ways to apply it-- A fluffier, lighter powder puff thing, which I love for the days I just want light coverage to set my skin and avoid shine. Then, it comes with a heartier spongey foam applicator, and this is the one I tend to use more. It allows you to really apply it and achieve the coverage of a foundation.  I am very weary of foundations as I absolutely can't stand cake face or an obvious color difference, but this powder has allowed these issues to almost always be avoided. Even when I lay it on thick (on days I feel pimply or red) people still tell me I have beautiful skin and that I look glowey. They never say, oh your makeup looks good. Instead they tell me my skin looks good! It also is sheer enough that I can wear my dark summer color well into the fall. I do however need to get a lighter color for winter, as my summer color is now just too dark on my paler untanned skin.  Something to keep in mind is that it may be important to try colors on in the store. I am of swedish descent-- I am very fair naturally, but somehow I tan very well and get pretty dark in the summer months. My summer color is matte sable IV, and when I saw this compared to other colors I was shocked-- thinking it was so dark!! But, it works for me, so that is why I recommend trying colors on, as you never know what will look good.  Another thing to keep in mind that this powder does look a little cakey to me initially IF it is applied with a brush! I went in with a friend to get her to try this, and the employee put it on her with a brush. It looked a little too obvious that she had makeup on and not as velvety smooth as this usually does. However, after about 30 minutes it seemed to set in and looked perfect as usual.  VERY HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!! LOVE LOVE LOVE"

It works to take the shine away from your moisturizer so you are left with a matte medium coverage. I always apply this dry and with the round sponge it comes with. I did try it wet but that didn't work for me, it looked unnatural. I also like this product because its easy to apply and doesn't require a lot of time, steps or brushes. It also has good staying power throughout the day.  It comes in a variety of shades so you should be able to find a match (not sure about darker skin tones though-it may be more limiting). I have some of the fairest skin and this is one reason I've stuck with this product as the lightest shades work for me, where as 95% of all other foundations seem unnatural or one shade too dark for my skin tone.  I took one star off because sometimes if your skin is dry or flaky this powder won't look as natural or nice as a foundation. So you just have to be careful of that.  This is probably my most used make-up item and most repurchased as well so for that reason alone I'd recommend trying it out to anyone, esp if you've been eyeing it for a while or just want to try something different then liquid foundation."

After it dried i had some patches of cakey makeup. when i use it as a dry powder with the puffer it makes my face VERY cakey. I cant return it because i used too much of the product trying different ways to get coverage. I read all the great reviews about it saying how natural and easy it is to build coverage, but not in my case. I have naturally dry skin which is why i stay away from powders but i moisturize with two of lancomes moisturizers and i use a good primer so i thought this would work. this has been the only thing from lancome i have been very disappointed with. i guess you get what you pay for."

This is a more neutral color which really helps even out some redness. Partly, I know that this is one reason I love it so much. (A great product that doesn't match your shade will never look good.)  I've only tried using it wet a few times, and don't really care for it that way. It seems too much gets lost in the sponge, and it has less coverage that way. It stays on best dry over a light moisturizer.  I love this foundation, so I don't know why I keep trying other brands. (Maybe I'm looking for that impossible-in-real-life look the models have.) Every time I try another brand, I either throw some away or use it up then go back to the Lancome.  I've used both the regular and fragrance free, and aside from the scent, they're exactly the same. And the fragrance-free is really completely without any fragrance at all."

One for application as a powder and another for application as a foundation (which I haven't really used yet). It comes with a whole selection of shades, too.

The product has a very light, clean, fresh scent. Although I primarily use this dry as a light powder foundation to even out my skin tone and mattify my face, coverage is very buildable (both wet and dry). I do have a few scars and imperfections on my face, and this does a good job of covering them up without drawing attention to these areas. The powder goes on very smooth and looks very natural, especially on normal to oily skin.  In the winter, like any other powder on my dry, winter skin, it does sit on top of my face a bit more and look more noticeable, but this is very easily fixed by applying just after moisturing or applying the powder wet for touch ups. This is not a fault of the product though, it is not drying or irritating to my skin at all!  It seemed expensive to me, but this product is truely fantastic and worth the price (and that says a lot because I have a student budget). With everyday use (and I use this frequently to control shine throughout the day), it lasts me at least a year (though I do tend to buy a fresh one instead of digging into the pan).  I would recommend this product to anyone!"

Their are a few cons that go along with it however, but not enough to give one star off.. since it's sort of unrelated to the actual performance of the powder. I bought it in matte honey, which was the darkest color they had in the store. I have a medium skin tone. PROS: Color blends well, goes on super smooth, leaves a matte finish and controls shine better than ANY powder yet! i never thought it was possible. Skin is left looking near perfect. Coverage is really good for a powder, too. Comes with two different applicators, one for lighter coverage (I have not tried it yet) and another for more coverage (a sponge which I like). CONS: The smell of the powder is pretty strong for the first 30 minutes or so. I've never experienced that, and I really don't care for it. It's not a gross smell, however. Also, I wish the sponge applicator fit in the compact, since that's what I use. It's a little too thick to keep the compact closed. NOTE: I have only used the powder dry, not wet."

I went around the Sephora store, trying all the powder foundations, and found that this and Clinique's version have the softest, smoothest feel and offer the best coverage. (And both actually come in colors pale enough for me.) I got this in Matte Porcelain I, which is described as a warm shade, but I find it to be neutral. My skin is neutral/pink, and it matches perfectly. I don't use it as foundation, but as a setting powder over my foundation, and I don't look cakey or like I'm wearing a mask. And because it's matte, it keeps my oily skin from turning shiny. Beautiful powder, and, like all Lancome products, it smells good, too!"

I used to wear loose powder (Clinique) but found that the coverage was too light and didn't last long enough. This powder is very fine and matches the yellow undertones in my Asian skin. Plus it's much easier to carry around for touch-ups than loose powder or foundation. I haven't had the problems expressed by other reviewers like dryness. I've just purchased this product in the summer time so I haven't been using a primer or moisturizer prior to applying. I do use a toner right before, though, so that might explain why I don't have patchy dry areas."

I highly recommend and I am pick! :)"

However my skin becomes oily after 2 hours of applying this foundation and wears off very quickly. It only has a light-medium coverage and doesn't cover my acne scars at all. I bought the Matte Linen which is supposed to be yellow-based but it still looks pink on my face compared to my neck. Lancome foundations (whether liquid or powder) never work for me. I will return it tomorrow."

I bought a color that didnt work out, and returned it for another color. It was really easy to exchange the two. Anyways, don't pay attention to the colors on the website! they look so different in person. I cant believe the difference of looking at the colors in the store and online. They are totally inaccurate on here.  but, the foundation is wonderful and i can wear it over my lancome liquid foundation or alone. I love it. I wear the matte ecru color..which again, does NOT look like this in person. I recommend going to the store or lancome counter before purchasing online."
