I bought him this cleanser and the face moisturizer as a gift and he absolutely fell in love with it and uses them both daily.  He works landscaping and construction so this really helps get in his pores and facial hair and removes all the excess sweat dead skin and grime from work and smells incredible.  He tried to pretend he didn’t love it as much as he does until it started to run out and asked for more.  The smell is great and it works incredibly we even fight over it while on vacation!"

Then because is shaves his head (no hair left), I encouraged him to add sunscreen everyday in the morning, on face, neck and head. He  has very light skin. When I bought this cleanser for him, I didn't think he would go for it, but as he started using it, he never went back. Now this. little lives in the shower and it has been replaced over and over again for new ones once it runs out. The smell is light and not noticeable much on the skin. I recommend it!"
