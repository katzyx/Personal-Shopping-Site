I had previously used a Kiehl‚Äôs eye cream for a few months and I only saw very minimal improvements under my eyes.   I started using this about a week ago, and my under eyes have drastically improved. They look brighter, smoother, and I need less concealer for a beautiful finish.  The first night I used it, it felt a little warm under my eyes. I didn‚Äôt get a rash or any other symptoms, so I kept going and nothing bad has come of it and it no longer feels that way. I have slightly sensitive skin, but if you have very sensitive skin or don‚Äôt want to take any risks, I‚Äôd suggest skipping this product.  I‚Äôm excited to see the improvements over the rest of the product, and if it keeps going like it has been then this will definitely be a repurchase!"

However, it has been GREAT for my puffy, dark under eyes--it really makes a huge difference. My main gripe is that, for this price, the packaging should be absolutely perfect. While initially I really enjoyed the  product dispensing style, I have found that almost daily some product gets stuck and crusty in the tube...that means I have to get rid of that product, it's gross, and I'm afraid of eye irritation. I think packaging really needs improvement."

Enter Caudalie Vinoperfect Eye Cream, a much-hyped solution promising to brighten, tighten, and rejuvenate the delicate skin around the eyes. Here's my honest take:  Pros:      Lightweight Texture: The cream glides on smoothly and absorbs quickly, which is great for daytime use under makeup.     Hydration: It does provide a decent level of hydration without feeling greasy or heavy.     Packaging: The sleek tube is hygienic and travel-friendly, making it easy to use on the go.  Cons:      Limited Results: While it claims to target dark circles and brighten the under-eye area, I didn't notice a significant improvement even after consistent use for several weeks.     Price: Considering the somewhat lackluster results, the price point feels steep compared to other eye creams on the market.     Fragrance: Though it's subtle, the fragrance might be a concern for those with sensitive skin or a preference for fragrance-free products.

Cons: It can be hard to squeeze out the right amount. I find that it's either too little, and it's hard to spread, or it's too much. If you squeeze too much and get it too close to your eyes it will burn. I also find that using too much makes it hard to sink in. It's a VERY thin line between too little and too much.  Overall: It's a good eye cream that gets the job done. It hasn't done anything for my dark circles or fine lines but I wouldn't expect it to. It hydrates my orbital bone area and that's enough for me.  I used this product once a day in the morning. I have normal/dry acne prone skin.

Needless to say, I was excited to try this product out of Caudalie‚Äôs 3 undereye options (Premier Cru ‚Äì anti-aging, Resveratrol Lift ‚Äì puffiness/firming, Vinoperfect ‚Äì all dark circles).  Ingredients ‚Äì The 3 ingredients hyped up are Viniferine (reduces undereye circles), Niacinamide (hydration), and caffeine (brightens), but it is also free from fragrance, silicone, PEGs, parabens, and mineral oil.  Product applicator ‚Äì even at room temperature, the ceramic applicator tip is a standout feature that has a cooling effect while also ensuring smooth coverage.  Usage and results ‚Äì I found the product to be gentle and refreshing from first use. I have sensitive skin (especially under my eyes) but I did not experience any irritation/stinging/burning. I especially appreciated that it did not prevent the smooth application of makeup, which I have experienced with other undereye creams in the past.  So far, I have used the eye cream 2x/day (AM and PM). Since Caudalie itself claims ‚Äò86% saw their dark circles visibly brightened‚Äô after a 56-day trial, my expectations were managed as far as how long it may take to see results. All that said, after just under a month of consistent usage, I have not YET seen a change that would show a significant difference in pictures (since I find that to be a good way of monitoring results for any type of under eye cream). However, I plan to continue to use it because I want to give my skin the full length of recommended time. I also just genuinely like the way the product feels ‚Äì it has a unique combination of feeling like it both tightens AND hydrates, first when being applied and then upon absorption.  For those reasons alone, I would recommend trying it, with the caveat that it is not a magic eraser for undereye circles (but nothing is!).

I also suffer from severe dark circles that make me look constantly tired and much older than the rest of my face. This cream gave me almost immediate results making my skin look hydrated and smooth and making my dark circles less noticeable every time I use it. It has taken years off my appearance by making me look well rested and making my eyes hydrated and moisturized. Most eye creams make my eyes even drier and leave me with dry patches under my eyes. this one gives me a nice healthy glow from within appearance without a trace of dryness.      It's a lovely lightweight formula that's silky smooth and absorbs almost immediately. There is no sticky feeling and it gives me a beautiful base for applying my makeup with no pilling whatsoever. I love the applicator. I keep mine in the fridge and it's so refreshing in the morning. It wakes my eye area up and makes me look well rested. The ceramic tip makes the product glide on smoothly. The moisture and hydration lasts throughout the day and i haven't had any dry patches since I started using this eye cream. It has a pleasant light fragrance which I enjoy.         I look forward to seeing the results after two months since that's when they say the full effects can be seen. I will definitely be keeping this in my skincare routine. I have discovered the best way to keep your concealer from creasing under your eyes is to improve the eye area so you don't need the concealer!

Vitamin C, Niacinamide, and Caffeine do have brightening properties, and I saw a little bit of difference in the couple of weeks I was using it. I do wish I could have seen a bigger difference, but that might just take time! I also noticed the puffiness that generally appears in the morning has eased. Overall, this is a great product with good ingredients that didn't aggravate my sensitive skin and left my under-eye skin feeling replenished and renewed. I received this product for free from Topbox in exchange for an honest review!"

You only need to press lightly and use the cooling and relieving ceramic part to spread it into the eye area. If you apply too much pressure, it can cause too much cream to come out and accidentally get into your eyes, which can cause a slight burning sensation. To avoid this, it is recommended to apply the cream gently.   I've started keeping the eye cream in my fridge and have noticed that in the morning, after applying it, my eyes feel more awakened, less puffy, and hydrated. I've only been using it for a short time, but I'm already enjoying how it's working so far. I hope to see more significant results in the future regarding my dark circles and fine lines."

As I get older I have been noticing more lines around my eyes and have been trying different products. I have been using this product for a months now and I noticed that the lines around and under my eyes are getting so much better! I like that for the first time a product that actually delivers what it claims to do actually works! It is helping to reduce the puffiness and the fine lines around my eye area and is also making it smoother and softer. I love the texture of this cream slides on smoothly and is hydrating, cooling, and absorbed easily! I also keep this in my mini fridge the applicator cools me down so much if my eyes are puffy!  The Key ingredients are: Viniferine, Caffeine The Formula: 97% natural origin ingredients Ophthalmologically tested Fragrance-free Vegan  Retail: $55.00 I highly recommend trying this product!   #topbox #topboxcircle #eyecream #caulalie #redheadangel70 @redheadangel70"

For whatever unknown reason, I could not get the hang of using the sort of applicator tip of the tube, I could never get the product to go where I wanted it to, and generally just ended up making a mess of things. I decided to just apply a small dot and then work it in gently with my finger instead (haha). Not only was the skin underneath my eyes much brighter and more normal looking, but it also felt hydrated and a lot softer.

It is lightweight, moisturizing, penetrates fast and is not irritating on the rare occasion it gets into my eye due to user error. It also actually works - my dark circles have faded considerably. I like the applicator, however the grooves in the back somehow catch excess eye cream, which is unhygienic and wastes product. Lastly, it may seem pricey, but a little bit goes a long way, so it is worth it in my book!  I received this product for free from Topbox Marketing for testing and review purposes."

As someone who has tried various eye creams, hoping to find the magic potion that combats dark circles, puffiness, and fine lines, I approached this product with a blend of skepticism and hope. Texture and application are where this eye cream truly begins to shine. The cream has a lightweight, almost serum-like consistency that glides onto the skin effortlessly. It absorbs quickly, leaving no greasy residue, which makes it a perfect companion for both your morning and evening skincare routines. For someone who juggles a busy schedule, I appreciate that it sits well under makeup, serving as a smooth primer for concealer. The true test, however, lies in the results. Caudalie's Vinoperfect line is renowned for its brightening properties, thanks to the star ingredient, Viniferine, which is derived from grapevine sap.

Dark circles and puffiness have always been my main concerns, and finding an eye cream that effectively addresses these issues while being gentle on the skin can be daunting. However, after incorporating this product into my routine, I can confidently say that it has exceeded my expectations.  Brightening Power: The standout feature of the Caudalie Vinoperfect Eye Cream is its ability to brighten the under-eye area. Enriched with Viniferine, a natural ingredient derived from grapevine sap, this cream effectively reduces the appearance of dark circles, leaving the skin looking noticeably brighter and more radiant. With consistent use, I've seen a significant improvement in my under-eye area's overall tone and luminosity.  Hydration and Nourishment: One of the key benefits of this eye cream is its deeply hydrating formula. Infused with moisturizing ingredients like hyaluronic acid and olive squalane, it provides long-lasting hydration to the delicate skin around the eyes, helping to minimize the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles. The lightweight texture absorbs quickly into the skin, leaving it feeling smooth, supple, and refreshed.  Gentleness: I have sensitive skin, particularly around my eyes, so I'm always cautious when trying new products in this area. I'm pleased to report that the Caudalie Vinoperfect Eye Cream is incredibly gentle and non-irritating. It's ophthalmologist-tested and fragrance-free, making it suitable for even the most sensitive skin types. I've experienced no stinging, burning, or redness, which is a huge plus for me.

			"review_text": "As someone who received the Caudalie Vinoperfect eye cream for testing purposes, I have some honest observations to share  Active Ingredients: The first thing that struck me was the minimal list of active ingredients. Given the product's claims, I expected a more robust formula. Unfortunately, this lack of potency made it hard for me to believe that it could effectively address concerns like dark circles.  Dark Circles and Genetics: Dark circles around the eyes can indeed be influenced by genetics and the depth of our eye sockets. While skincare products can help improve the appearance, it's essential to manage our expectations. The Vinoperfect Eye Cream's claims seemed ambitious in this regard.  Applicator Design: Now, let's talk about the applicator. Instead of a convenient roller ball, the cream comes in a standard squeeze-out tube with a tapered plastic end. Unfortunately, this design dispenses **way too much product**. It's wasteful and frustrating, especially when you're trying to be precise with application.  Formula Disappointment: Considering the minimal active ingredients, the applicator woes, and the product's lofty promises, I would have been genuinely upset if I had purchased this eye cream myself. It falls short of expectations.  As someone who values transparency, I can not promote a product that doesn't live up to its claims. While I appreciate the opportunity to test it, I believe it would be unjust to recommend the Caudalie Vinoperfect eye cream to others due to its price and lack of impressive anti-aging ingredients.Remember, skincare experiences can vary, and what works for one person may not work for another. Personally, I will only purchase eye creams that contain retinol. √íur eyes are the first place to age! Always consider your unique skin type and needs before purchasing products."

I primarily use this at night, so it gives my nighttime routine a more spa-like feeling when I'm using this. While I like the idea of the applicator, but I find that it makes very little difference in actually rubbing in the product (I always end up using my fingers) and I do find that this eye cream takes slightly longer to soak into my skin than some others I have used. Since the formula is relatively thin for an eye cream, I do find that this can spread out quite a bit, but I don't have any issues with it stinging my eyes!

I have been using this eye cream for only 2 weeks so it's a bit early to see massive results as far as brightening of under eye darkness. It has niacinamide which is a proven skincare ingredient but niacinamide is something that takes time to see results.  The cream itself feels very nice. It is lightweight, spreads easily into a smooth layer under your eyes, and absorbs and dries quickly. In using this I have not had any stinging, burning, irritation, or watery eyes at all. It leaves your eye area feeling hydrated and refreshed.  Now the applicator tip is amazing! It feels like a mini luxury massage for your eyes. Even if the tube is sitting out at room temperature, the applicator tip feels nice and cold. Apply a small amount under they eye and use the applicator to massage it around(you can use your finger for more control, but you won't get that nice cold feeling) and it dries quickly with a slight tightening effect as well. I haven't seen too much in the brightening of dark under eyes, but I know it is something that takes time. However I will continue to use this because it feels very luxurious and hydrating, and I love the cold applicator tip.

Its formula, enriched with niacinamide, initially intrigued me with promises of brightened under-eye areas. After consistent use, I noticed a gradual reduction in the appearance of my dark circles, which lent a refreshed and more awake appearance to my eyes. However, the cream's texture was slightly thicker than preferred, requiring extra effort to ensure complete absorption. Additionally, while the results were promising, they took several weeks to become truly noticeable, demanding patience from the user.

I was a bit skeptical that a single product can tackle all different types of dark circles. From what I have experienced and learned, it is the combination of caffeine and the massage head on the product that stimulates circulation. I did enjoy the little massage head but there‚Äôs a small gap between the hole from which the cream passes and the massage head where the cream gets stuck. I wish that it would come in a smooth one piece. I also noticed that while it was hydrating, it is not really moisturizing. A lot of people use ice cream to moisturize the eye area since it tends to get dry. If this product had more moisture retention, I would definitely settle for it as my holy grail, given the effect on the dark circles.

True to the Caudalie name, this eye cream is exceptional. I‚Äôve been using their Premier Cru line I got in Paris but when I ran out of that, I bought the Vinoperfect serum and my skin is so much brighter. I was just about to buy this when it arrived for testing and it‚Äôs just as good as the serum!!! It gives me that refreshed woken up look as it brightens my complexion and helps with my dark circles. It‚Äôs super light application for under makeup so it‚Äôs not accentuating my fine lines like another popular brand does. Run- don‚Äôt walk- to get this product.

Infused with niacinamide, this cream intrigued me with its promise of illuminating the delicate under-eye area. Upon consistent use, I was pleasantly surprised to witness a gradual reduction in the appearance of my dark circles, lending a refreshed look to my overall complexion. However, I found the consistency to be slightly thicker than anticipated, requiring a gentle tapping motion for proper absorption. While the results were promising, it's worth noting that patience is key as noticeable improvements took a few weeks to manifest. Despite this, the brightening effect and the nourishing feel make it a worthy addition to any skincare routine, particularly for those battling stubborn dark circles.

I have used Caudalie premier cru eye cream and had positive results with that but this is going to be my new holy grail! Whether it‚Äôs stress, hormones, genetics or the combination of the three I have always had noticeable dark circles. Honestly it just makes my eyes look tired. I‚Äôm sure that we have all used concealer to try and cover the dark circles that will inevitably show through at some point during the day. I hadn‚Äôt found anything that actually faded the dark circles. I have only been using this for about 10 days so I didn‚Äôt expect noticeable results at all. Skin care including eye cream takes time. I must say that for the first time in years I didn‚Äôt have to apply tons of concealer under my eyes! My eyes look brighter, the dark circles are almost completely unnoticeable. This cream is much thinner than premier cru and both are great for different reasons. This has the consistency of a lotion which I love! You barely have to use any at all for coverage. It sinks into your skin very quickly and doesn‚Äôt pill. The way I apply it is with gentle tapping of my middle finger being careful not to pull or tug the delicate under eye area. You can apply it with the applicator but I prefer to use the applicator after I have put it on with my finger. I keep it in the refrigerator and it is cooling and so soothing. This will last a long time and I‚Äôm so excited about my results already! If you are on the fence, buy it!

I have used a lot of eye creams, serums, etc., in the past trying to find one with the right active ingredients that will help waken my tired eyes. When I started using Caudalie Vinoperfect Dark Circle Brightening Eye Cream with Niacinamide, I immediately knew I found my next holy grail! I love the metal applicator for a nice cool application. This is an extraordinary treatment that helps firm, depuff, brighten, and hydrate after just 1 use. I noticed my skin feels brighter and more awake. The texture of the eye cr√®me is very soothing and delicate. I use it in the morning and at night. I pat it onto my skin around the entire eye area, in a gentle circular motion with my ring finger. Its overall formula is so gentle and absorbs seamlessly around my eyes and they look and feel more hydrated while I feel a tingle from it firming. My eyebags have significantly reduced and my dark circles have really started to diminish making my eyes look brighter. I use this twice a day, in the AM and PM, and have no  sensitivity. With makeup, I wait one minute to fully absorb before applying. My makeup then goes on flawlessly without any pilling because my eye is smooth. A little product goes a long way so the pump really helps with applying too much! Ultimately, this has given me a brighter, healthier, energized, looking glow under my eyes and I am enthusiastic about continuing to use this to see ongoing results!"

My favorite thing about this cream is for sure the ceramic tip. Using light massage on your face (or of course your entire body) is so good for blood flow, collagen production and lymph drainage.   The benefits of the ceramic tip is the cooling effect due to the wand and, enhances the visible brightening results.  I am super excited to use this eye cream 2X daily (both AM & PM) and I am truly hoping that with consistency, I will see these results for myself!  I highly recommend you try! ü©∑ü§çüíØ"

It has a nice lightweight satiny feel at first, but I do notice a subtle tightening effect once it dries. It's not too bothersome, especially when layering my other products, but I would not consider using it before bed. It does do a decent job of smoothing out my eye bags with a brightening effect.  Overall, I would give it a 5 out of 10 for not being the best I've ever tried, but it's also certainly not the worst."

			"review_text": "As a skincare enthusiast always on the lookout for effective eye creams, I decided to try the Caudalie Vinoperfect Dark Circle Brightening Eye Cream with Niacinamide. However, my experience with this product left much to be desired.  While the brand's reputation for natural ingredients and skincare innovation intrigued me, the results fell short of my expectations. Despite containing niacinamide, known for its brightening properties, the cream failed to deliver noticeable improvements in reducing dark circles or brightening the under-eye area.  One of the main issues I encountered was the consistency of the cream. It felt lightweight upon application, which I appreciated, but it didn't seem to absorb well into the skin. Instead, it left a slightly greasy residue that made it challenging to layer with other products or apply makeup over it.  In terms of hydration, the eye cream provided adequate moisture, but it didn't offer the level of hydration I was hoping for, especially for a product marketed as brightening. Over time, I didn't observe any significant changes in the appearance of my under-eye area, leading me to question the effectiveness of the formula.  Additionally, the packaging, while aesthetically pleasing, was not very practical. The tube design made it difficult to control the amount of product dispensed, often resulting in wastage.  Although the Caudalie Vinoperfect Dark Circle Brightening Eye Cream may work for those with minimal concerns or as a preventative measure, it's unlikely to provide satisfactory results for those seeking targeted treatment for dark circles or significant brightening effects.  In conclusion, while the product isn't necessarily bad, it falls short of delivering the promised results. Given its lackluster performance and relatively high price point, I would recommend exploring other options for addressing dark circles and brightening the under-eye area."

Caudalie is known for their use of grape-derived ingredients, and this eye cream is no exception. The Viniferine, derived from grapevine sap, is a key ingredient that helps to brighten the under-eye area and reduce the appearance of dark spots. I appreciate that the brand prioritizes using clean and effective ingredients.  Another aspect that sets this eye cream apart is its packaging. The sleek and hygienic tube ensures that the product remains fresh and easy to dispense. A little goes a long way, so the tube lasts for a decent amount of time.

Caudalie is one of my favorite skin care brands and the one I have had the best results with. This eye cream does not take ages to work either. I have dark circles under my eyes and sometimes concealer doesn't cover them completely. This is a great base for my under eye concealer too. I've been baking my concealer for ages but it really wasn't necessary with using this as a base. The ceramic tip on this one works better for me than the metal tip on the Premier Cru cream. As I get older my skin around my eyes gets thinner and more sensitive to some products. I experienced no reaction to this cream at all, even with caffeine being a main ingredient. The final verdict is that I absolutely recommend this eye cream if you have dark circles under your eyes that never seem to go away or get lighter. I always leave fair, object and honest reviews and this one is no exception.   I received this product for free from Topbox Marketing for testing and review purposes."

Our eye areas are SUPER sensitive areas to begin with and the skin is super thin so everyone should be careful about what they put around their eyes and mouth!! I'm so amazed at the products Caudalie keeps coming out with. The only reason I took away 1 Star is because I feel like $55 USD is a lot to pay for an eye cream.

I am in my mid-thirties and when I was coming up as a teenager we just didn't have this whole skin care/makeup trend that we have now. As preteens and teenagers they are getting into it and all I can say is that I am 100% JELLY! I WISH I had taken better care of my skin in my teen and early adult years. Instead I quite literally baked it out in the sun at the pool and the beach and even *cringe* at the tanning salons. This product is a lifesaver if you have been anything like me in your younger years. What I struggle with the most NOW I feel is the redness in my face. I've tried to not wear makeup and just do my skincare routine and let my skin do its thing but I just don't feel comfortable going out daily with basically red skin (mainly my cheek areas: and let someone say something to make me blush - it's OVER. My face is TOTALLY BEAT RED - ALL OVER. Which is why I literally LOVE this product. It has three main ingredients in it: niacinamide (you may also see it called nicotinamide). It's basically just a liquid form of B3 (in this product) and it was pretty much made for me as it's main benefit is to NOT CAUSE SKIN FLUSHING! The next ingredient it has in it is Viniferine - which is a molecule that actually TARGETS and brightens dark spots. It's PERFECT for women like me who LOVE to be outside and even exposed to the sun for long periods of time because it's non-photosensitive! The last ingredient is caffeine. And you may ask well, obviously caffeine is in most kinds of coffee so what could it possibly do for my skin? The answer is it actually reduces blood flow to your skin which in turn makes it appear tighter AND brighter. It has anti-aging properties and can also smooth the appearance of any of those pesky wrinkles that may pop up on ya one day! GO GET THIS PRODUCT. LIKE IMMEDIATELY. üòÇ"

It's not scented, it doesn't feel heavy or sticky, it doesn't leave a residue behind. Immediately after using for the first time the skin under my eyes felt more hydrated and moisturized. The applicator is perfect for tapping the cream into the skin and always feels cool and refreshing. It is great for wearing under make-up,  my concealer applies and blends easier and doesn't look as cakey because my skin is so hydrated. I have mild to moderate dark circles under my eyes and within a few weeks of daily use they are noticeably reduced. I feel that on most days I could skip concealer if I wanted because my dark circles just aren't an issue. I've used a lot of different eye creams that have promised to brighten and hydrate but have always been let down, this is my new holy grail eye cream. I look well rested, brighter and have even noticed a difference in my fine lines. I absolutely recommend this."

When I started using Caudalie Vinoperfect Dark Circle Brightening Eye Cream with Niacinamide, I immediately knew I found my next holy grail! I love the metal applicator for a nice cool application. This is an extraordinary treatment that helps firm, depuff, brighten, and hydrate after just 1 use. I noticed my skin feels brighter and more awake. The texture of the eye cr√®me is very soothing and delicate. I use it in the morning and at night. I pat it onto my skin around the entire eye area, in a gentle circular motion with my ring finger. Its overall formula is so gentle and absorbs seamlessly around my eyes and they look and feel more hydrated while I feel a tingle from it firming. My eyebags have significantly reduced and my dark circles have really started to diminish making my eyes look brighter. I use this twice a day, in the AM and PM, and have no  sensitivity. With makeup, I wait one minute to fully absorb before applying. My makeup then goes on flawlessly without any pilling because my eye is smooth. A little product goes a long way so the pump really helps with applying too much! Ultimately, this has given me a brighter, healthier, energized, looking glow under my eyes and I am enthusiastic about continuing to use this to see ongoing results! #freeproduct"

The texture of the cream is nice, it applies nicely, no irritation or greasy feel. My eyes feel immediately hydrated. Now talk about how effective this cream is. I would say my dark circles are not very prominent however when you see closely they are there and dark. I do see my dark circles have lighten in the sense that my eye area look more bright and hydrated that my dark circles look light. This makes me feel so good when I look closely my eyes, dark circles are there but lighten. I think sharing the before and after pictures can not justify the improvement as its little but for me its a step towards improvements.  I will keep using this cream to achieve the better results."

I would like to see the hole where the cream dispenses on the round applicator side instead of the opposite side. I would have been less likely to get the cream in my eye if it were on the round side. Since the applicator is built into the tube it is easy to inadvertently squeeze it while applying.

I use retinol eye cream quite often, which leaves my eyes dry. Since I've also got redness and dark circles around my eyes, this eye cream is perfect for me! It's got a silky soft texture, and it goes on sooo smoothly. As soon as I apply the eye cream with the delicate applicator (then pat it in with my fingertip), my eyes clear right up! The caffeine and niacinamide in the formula are lifesavers! It's definitely one of the best eye creams I've ever tried, and it's now my favorite non-retinol eye cream! This stuff is so good! I HIGHLY recommend it. It's a total Holy Grail skincare product! #freeproduct"

Texture wise, it's incredibly light and airy, and you pretty much can't even tell it's there just seconds after original application. Although it's somewhat tinted,  it shockingly doesn't give the eye area that cakey, too much makeup look. Instead it dramatically enhances the overall complexion, easily smoothing fine lines and crow's feet, and effortlessly diminishing any under eye discoloration or darkness. As if my joy ended there, I was ecstatic to see 2 of the main ingredients are niacinamide and caffeine which usually do wonders with my skin. I noticed visible results within a few hours after just my first use. I think what I love the most with this new Caudalie Eye Cream is the purposeful metal applicator tip that remains nice and cool as to help instantaneously soothe and depuff the eye area as you apply. So many awesome attributes. #FreeProduct #TryWithTopbox"

I‚Äôve only been using this for about a week morning and night and my dark circles have faded and the puffiness has totally diminished.  This eye cream is vegan, and has two of the best ingredients, 100% natural caffeine which decreases dark circles and puffiness and niacinamides which evens skin tone and brightens. Before I was so self conscious of my tired eyes, today I don‚Äôt have to be. I received this #freeproduct and I strongly recommend it. I will be switching my eye cream to this one from now on."

It spread the products perfectly across my skin. The cream and applicator together just glides on my skin. After 1 week I cannot weigh in as of yet to the diminishing of dark circles. What I can say is it has already improved my under eye area. My fine lines have amazingly shrunk some which really blew my mind. It's not like I don't use a product regularly to my under eyes so this is just fantastic!!  It is an extremely effective hydrator too. My eyes, even after more than 8 hours, still appear hydrated, but not oily appearing either. I am very excited to see what is to come with longer use. I'm definitely going to buy more of this before this one is gone!"
