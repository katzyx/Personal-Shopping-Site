			"review_text": "Guys, if you want the best autumn/winter scent of the year, this is it. Deeply sweet, cedar pencil shavings. Frankincense and cardamom at the start, that are strong but smooth. When it softens to a lovely patchouli and cedar? Oh, it's just perfect. I have a good collection and this one has been used on repeat since I picked it up."
