			"review_text": "So.... I kind of hate gel moisturizers - I'm over 40 and my skin always leans on the dryer side nowadays, HOWEVER I told myself I'd give this particular moisturizer a shot and I'm glad I did. I'll start off by saying the first couple of uses I wasn't quite sure if I'd keep using it. The gel didn't feel as creamy as I'd like but I did LOVE The orange/pomegranate experience which made me really enjoying applying it morning and night - Since it is a gel the first couple of uses felt a little tacky but as I kept using it I noticed my skin felt bouncier - looked plump and hydrated and as I knew its chocked full of peptides I knew my skin was getting some much needed antiaging love as well. Tata Harpers products all work so beautifully when used together and when I used the resurfacing serum and the oil cleanser I noticed the gel formula moisturizer was really sealing in all that moisture and those great ingredients and I've since started using it as my staple moisturizer."

I love this moisturizer so much and it’s amazing for my super dehydrated skin. I love a thick cream and I find this one is thick enough to hydrate without clogging my pores. I love to use this at night to really hydrate and lock in moisture after a serum or in the mornings before I apply any makeup. While it is thick it is also light weight and absorbs easily. The scent is light and has a spa vibe. The packaging is amazing and luxurious and I love the pump feature that allows for a sanitary experience. Definitely a new favorite moisturizer that I love year round. I also love that the moisturizer is from a clean brand at Sephora!"

As always, Tata packaging makes me feel super luxurious and excited to use the products! The moisturizer is super lightweight and does not feel greasy. In the winter months, I usually struggle hydrating my skin with any products besides super heavy creams. However, this Tata moisturizer did the trick. It really locked in the moisture after I cleanse my skin. I have also noticed my skin stop flaking with dry patches after using this moisturizer. I use this morning and night in my skincare routine and have noticed the moisturizer sits great under my makeup everyday. I've even used this as a primer on certain days!"

			"review_text": "Tata Harper’s Water Lock Moisturizer is a multitasking hero, combining hydration and priming in one lightweight, silicone-free formula. Orange peptides and pomegranate spheres create a breathable barrier for a smooth, makeup-ready finish, while macro hyaluronic acid locks in moisture. Perfect for combating dryness and uneven texture, it simplifies your routine with its moisturizer-primer hybrid design, so no extra primer is needed when you’re applying makeup. Bonus: it’s refillable and eco-friendly! Ideal for fresh, dewy skin all day long, this product is as functional as it is luxurious.  One downside to this product is the sunburn risk. If you’re in a sunny climate or are outdoors a lot, use with sunscreen and be mindful that the AHA content may increase sun sensitivity and could result in sunburn. For that reason, I wouldn't recommend this to people in summer-like climates year round, nor would I recommend it if you're outdoors a lot. For such an expensive product, I find the limitations to wearing it a bit of a bummer."

As someone with dry skin, I’ve tried plenty of moisturizers, but this one really stands out. First off, it hydrates like nothing else. My skin feels so much more nourished and soft, and it doesn’t leave any greasy residue—just a smooth, plump finish. I especially love how it feels under makeup—it works almost like a primer, giving me a nice, even base without feeling heavy.  The pump-action bottle is a big plus for me too. It dispenses the perfect amount of product, so I don’t waste any. Plus, the scent is just lovely—citrusy with a hint of forest freshness, which is so calming and refreshing. It’s not overpowering, but it’s the perfect way to start or end the day. I’ve noticed my skin looks more balanced and hydrated, and I don’t have the tight, dry feeling I used to have. It’s definitely become a staple in my routine, and I’ll be repurchasing. Highly recommend if you’re looking for something that hydrates, smooths, and leaves you with a nice glow."

I have again, dry, flaky, dull skin that gets itchy and irritates due to being dry so finding a moisturizer that really delivers is very important to me. I really love this moisturizer and everything about it. The texture is so nice and rich but doesn’t feel greasy, it absorbs into the skin quickly and immediately leaves my skin feeling hydrated, plump, soft and soothed. It makes my face look hydrated and visibly firmer and more radiant while also priming my skin for makeup application. This product is a 2-in-1 moisturizer and primer and its performance has been great for both.  What I absolutely love about this product is not only is the jar a beautiful frosted green glass jar that you don’t have to scoop out the product, it has a pump with a hole in the center to dispense product leaving everything easy and mess free but it’s also refillable to create less waste. When you run out all you have to due is purchase the refill pod and pop it in. Like the rest of Tata Harper products the ingredients are all natural and great for your skin. It’s safe for sensitive and reactive skin as well being their aren’t harsh chemicals in the formula. These products have transformed my skin in 2 days! I highly recommend!"

It’s incredibly lightweight and gives my skin that dewy, smooth, glassy looking glow without feeling greasy or heavy basically a glass skin dream. The blend of natural peptides and hyaluronic acid locks in moisture for hours upon hours, balancing my skin’s hydration levels all day long. I love that it’s silicone free and refillable, so I’m hydrating more and wasting less (it’s giving eco-friendly vibes!). My skin feels plump, soft, and super nourished, and I’m obsessed with how fresh and hydrated I look. For some reason the green packing makes me wish this had a watermelon scent, but otherwise I really adore it. Like all of Tara’s products the packaging is also a 10:10!"

What I love most is how well this product works with my skin despite weather or environmental factors. It feels deeply hydrating in dry cold climates while not being too heavy for more hot and humid days. The packaging is gorgeous, in the brand’s iconic green and gold shades. Though it is plastic instead of glass, I do appreciate that it is refillable and mindful of being eco-friendly. And I absolutely love the pump, which is not only hygienic but also delivers the perfect amount. I think a little goes a long way as the product glides smoothly along the skin with or without the prior use of serum. I do tend to prefer fragrance-free moisturizers, and while this does have a noticeable scent, it’s quite pleasant if you enjoy floral and herbal smells."

It was nothing like I'd ever seen before and it gave me a better impression of the brand. The lid was a bit confusing at first because I wasn't sure whether I should twist or pop it off but after the initial confusion, I was able to remove the cap with no fuss. The dispenser is one of those push down to dispense ones, where it disbursed the product ontop of a surface after being pressed. The product can also be fully removed from it's original container and can be replaced easily. The product itself was good, really nice and light texture and creaminess. It wasn't hard to apply or blend into the skin, and it absorbed very quickly, sort of like a water based moisturizer. My skin felt soft and hydrated."

			"review_text": "The Water-Lock Moisturizer from Tata Harper is one of the most interesting textures for a cream -- it's thick, but MY GOODNESS ... does it soften into one of the most beautiful water-based formulas you'll probably ever encounter. But, there is one problem. For someone in their mid-20s with unpredictably reactive skin, this worked well upon first application! My combination skin was well-balanced with the oilier areas still not feeling greasy. However, the scent is definitely something to get used to. It's earthiness, which also leans floral, is very fragrant. While I LOVED the scent at first, it was a little TOO strong (especially within the first few minutes of application). But, if you LOVE fragrance in skincare, this could easily be a 5-star moisturizer for you! And, who doesn't love the fact that it's refillable WITH a 'push' top?! Still, a total win in my book!"

This moisturizer is not too heavy to use during the day, and I usually apply it after my vitamin C serum and before my sunscreen. There is also no peeling of my makeup when I use this moisturizer which is a major plus! I noticed that my skin does not peel during the winter months, where my skin gets a bit dry around my nose area. Also, I absolutely am obsessed that the packaging is refillable!

To start with, the packaging is beautiful, useful and I love the dispenser because it gives me the perfect amount of use. The second thing is that, this has a very interesting and creamy texture and the third is the deep hydration sensation that I have been able to feel. Another good aspect is that it can be used in both day and night routine. However about the unfavorable aspect in my personal opinion, it is the very, very strong smell that this cream has. In fact, I cannot distinguish a specific smell and it is certainly not a chemical smell but I am very sensitive to skincare with fragrances so I like to be honest.

It looks very elegant sitting on my vanity so I feel fancy using it, but on top of that, it's got the reusable packaging and the airless pump.

It was also a bit bulky to open. The only redeeming quality of the packaging was the pump/dispensing system that only removes the amount of product needed keeping the rest protected. Considering that Tata Harper is a luxury brand and the price of this moisturizer, I expected the packaging to match that experience. It did not. However, the actual moisturizer was quite nice. It does have the classic Tata Harper fragrance, but it was overall mild and did not bother my skin at all. It was on the thicker side, which is great for my dry skin. I feel like it was able to fully absorb over night and gave me lasting hydration for the next 24 hours. If Tata Harper fixes the package design, this would be a winner."

			"review_text": "The texture of the moisturizer is really silky. It's creamy rather than gel, but it's light enough to soak in completely. It spreads really nicely and doesn't take much to cover your whole face. Unfortunately, beyond having a nice texture initially I am not a fan. Keep in mind that I have combo leaning dry, very acne prone, textured skin. The positives: I haven't been using too long but it does seem to help to lighten my post-acne hyperpigmentation. It soaks in nicely and if used in the morning doesn't leave my face shiny or greasy. The cons: I tried using it at night because of the AHA concerns I'll mention below and I woke up with my skin significantly drier and flakier than it was before. It hasn't helped my texture at all and I think I might have more little bumps than I did before I started using; at minimum no improvement. Some possible concerns for others: it's pretty scented. It smells like a mix of herbal grasses and orange zest but it lasts even on the skin long after the moisturizer has soaked in and dried. It also contains some ingredients that I know some people find clog pores like olive oil, although it is silicone free as a plus. It has a lot of ingredients and while they're very natural that might be of extra concern if you have allergies, and some of them aren't labeled with the common name (barley isn't noted while most of the others have the common name listed). The refill isn't much cheaper than the original jar.  It concerns me that it's a moisturizer meant to be used daily or even twice a day but it has AHAs. It has a warning about sun exposure, but also should probably warn about combining with other actives. I worry that using it everyday like a normal moisturizer would damage my skin barrier from the AHA. It does feel like a gentler exfoliating option which I like but I really think the warning should be much bigger: you NEED sunscreen with this."

The texture is creamy and lightweight and seals in moisture without leaving any sticky residue when applied. Next morning my skin glows and feels silky! It also works incredible under makeup as a primer. No need for multiple products.    I have been using it after I wash my face and use my serum every morning and before I go to bed and my skin is more smoother, it looks healthier and brighter, skin tone looks more even.   Water-Lock moisturizer has a light citrus scent which is not my favorite, but thankfully it’s not overpowering. It contains AHA, you have to make sure to wear sunscreen.     This is definitely a great summer moisturizer for me, but for winter time I prefer heavier/thicker moisturizers. Great quality of moisturizer and I would highly recommend it.     * This review was collected as part of a promotion."

			"review_text": "This review was collected as part of a promotion. Really wanted to like this moisturizer, but it’s just okay in my book. First pro right away was the pump dispenser, which keeps the product clean and hygienic. I also really like the scent! The orange blossom provides a freshness which pairs well with Tata’s earthiness. But it is a bit on the stronger side, so this may not be the best scent for those who are sensitive. The biggest con for me was that the product doesn’t clearly state that it contains lactic acid. Normally I like including acids in my routine, but this time I really just wanted a product that was hydrating with hyaluronic acid and nourishing with peptides. I used it on a damaged barrier (without knowing it contained lactic acid) and it stung pretty bad. I did notice the AHA warning on the box later on, so I guess this is more user error, but again the active ingredients should be clearly labeled. I also found the texture a little on the oily side which is not my preferred consistency. It’s not a product I would use daily because of the heavy texture."

This moisturizer is incredibly hydrating yet feels lightweight on the skin. The formula is silicone-free and uses natural ingredients, which is a huge plus for sensitive skin types like mine. What I love most about the Water-Lock Moisturizer is its innovative water-locking technology. It provides long-lasting hydration without feeling greasy or heavy. My skin feels soft, plump, and well-moisturized throughout the day. It also has a smooth, almost gel-like texture that absorbs quickly, making it perfect for layering under makeup. Since using this moisturizer, I've noticed a significant improvement in my skin's hydration levels and overall texture. There's no irritation or redness, just smooth, healthy-looking skin. Plus, the subtle, natural scent is refreshing and not overpowering. If you have sensitive skin and are looking for a moisturizer that delivers deep hydration and a comfortable wear, I highly recommend the Tata Harper Water-Lock Moisturizer.

The texture is nice and creamy. My face is visibly plump every time I use it and the amount of time my face stays moisturized is way longer than other moisturizers I currently own. The packaging is so elegant and pretty. I love that it's green. I don't like the way it is dispensed and how you gotta pump it out, but that's only personal opinion. Overall, I really like this moisturizer. I also like that it really doesn't have a smell because I'm not a fan of strong smelling moisturizers. My face feels very well hydrated.

I also tested it a few times without using the serum before to see how it feels on it's own and it was light but efficient. For me it's the perfect texture/feel.

I love the way it pumps up to the top, it is an awesome way to dispense the product precisely with no contamination and no contact with air. The moisturizer feels cool and hydrating on contact and doesn’t leave me overly shiny or greasy, just a glow. The moisture lasts all day and absorbs in well, so I don’t get any pilling when I put my makeup on top.  It actually seems like it makes my makeup go on smoother.  The smell is light and has a bright sort of citrusy tone to it. I once in a while get a very tiny bit of stinging when I put it on at first, but it goes away quickly.  Other than that minor sensation at times, my skin is responding well to it and is looking very bright and happy. This review was collected as part of a promotion."

It is not an easy place to earn as I tend to be a pretty harsh critic and with my desert dry skin, I am particularly harsh when it comes to moisturizers.  Hi, I am April. A forty-five-year-old self-proclaimed beauty enthusiast with a real focus on skin care. I learned a bit too late in life that if we don't take care of our skin, it won't take care of us and now for a decade or longer, I have been on a journey of discovering what works for me and what doesn't. I face some critical challenges, dry skin and eczema among them, and I am happy to report this beautiful cream not only helped the dryness but did not affect my eczema at all, which is always a risk with a scented product.  This moisturizer looks and feels like luxury. The packaging is stunning. It reminds me of something my grandmother would have kept on her vanity, and it brought a real feeling of nostalgia.  It seamlessly combines that classic vintage style with newer, more modern technology within that helps repair and heal our skin while helping build that ever-important barrier. It also has a fabulous fresh and creamy citrus scent I adore.  It applies smoothly to the skin, absorbing quickly and leaving behind no residue. I was in love with how it felt. It felt refreshing on my skin the moment I applied it. More so, I was impressed that the claim of not needing a primer for your makeup held true. I did not need a primer after applying this. My skin looked refreshed and hydrated. I felt better. My skin felt relieved. With it being summer my skin is dryer than ever, and it really needed a drink of thirst-quenching moisture and it found it.   I recommend this to anyone wanting a lightweight formula that brings the boxing gloves when taking on dehydrated skin and doesn't back down from a challenge. A heavy hitter with a bit of elegance.  Part of a collaboration with the brand."

I have heard many great things about Tata Harper, so I was very excited to finally try it for myself!  The Tata Harper Water Lock Moisturizer comes in a green glass jar with a dispenser that you push down on and the product comes out of.  I love this style of dispenser because it keeps air out of the product, so it stays fresher longer.  It also keeps the product sanitary, since you are not sticking your fingers into the product!  I also love the once you have used all of the product, you keep the jar and just replace the product pod!  Awesome for the environment!  The moisturizer smells amazing, a light citrus smell that is energizing!  I love that this continues to help with cell turnover from the AHA.  My skin looks smoother and feels softer.  I also love that this doubles as a primer!"

			"review_text": "I have been wanting to try Tata Harper for a long time because of the beautiful green packaging and good reputation of being a real skincare company without outsourcing. This water-lock moisturizer has very interesting texture. It’s very lightweight and very silky and smooth. It is very spreadable and absorbed quickly. Once it is applied on the skin it melted and feels like a serum. I would say it works for all skin types and very good for summer. Once it is dried it locks all the moisture into the deep layer of the skin and it doesn’t pile with my other skincare products which most gel texture products do. The bottle is refillable and the dispenser is very nice and hygienic. It contains AHA but my skin didn’t get irritated at all. If you have sensitive skin you might need to apply a small amount first."

Tata Harper’s Water-Lock Moisturizer is absolutely phenomenal if you love long-lasting hydration with a lightweight feel.   It’s silky, creamy goodness in a push-pump package. What’s not to love? It’s like primer for my primer. You can wear it alone or plop it right on top of that one moisturizer you love the look of but doesn’t provide enough hydration (you know the one).   I highly recommend this product to anyone looking to lock in their skin’s moisture and redeem their dehydrated and/or fatigue skin."

I have been wanting a new moisturizer that is on the thicker side, and the Tata Harper Skincare Water Lock Moisturizer has been a great addition. First off, I love the packaging of this product - it is a jar with a lid and when you take off the lid there is a press pump. This type of packing makes the product convinent, allows you not to waste product, and most importantly doesn’t cross contaminate the lotion by using your fingers. More importantly, upon application this lotion is on the thicker side but soaks into your skin quickly, giving me an instant glow. The peptides and hylauronic acid help drive hydration into the skin, leaving my skin feeling super moisturized, plump and healthy. I thouroughly recommend this product, and will be repurchasing as soon as I finish it.   This review was collected as part of a promotion."

It did somewhat moisturize my skin and has AHA’s to help resurface any tonal issues. I had to use other creams to get to the level of hydration that my skin needed.  At $68.00 for the initial purchase and $62.00 for the refill, it just didn't blow me away. I didn't see amazing results. If you have normal skin that needs a mid-weight cream to keep moisture in and work on defying wrinkles, this may help.  For me, there are other products that offer more bang for the buck."

It’s great for every day morning and night however, I think for the price points I have other products that I like just as much for almost $70. I would like it to be a little bit more life-changing Lol. However the brand is vegan, cruelty free, gluten free and the ingredients are derived from natural sources. If those are important to you then the price may be more justifiably. The jar has a pump easy access. It is really cool that it is refillable.

All my dry skin clients have different needs due to the many factors that can cause dry/dehydrated skin. Tata Harper has made a nice moisturizer that I would confidently recommend to most for daytime and hot summer nights. This moisturizer is a light treatment to help hydrate and smooth the skin. It has a beautiful light scent and features AHA's that gently exfoliates minor skin imperfections clearing a path for the skin to receive topical hydrator into the skin. I like this moisturizer because it hydrates without feeling heavy. Great for oily/combo and normal skin types. Dry skin types can enjoy this if they live in a warm climate or can enjoy this in the spring/summer seasons. If you are a mature skin type I would use this during the day, then a more targeted treatment at night. Sensitive skins should be okay during the winter."

It has left my skin softer, plumper, not greasy, with a healthy complexion even in the Florida humidity. The packaging system is great, the only thing that doesn’t fit for me is the cap.

The scent of this moisturizer is amazing. It smells delicious and refreshing. The unique container is very practical and handy. The texture is extremely rich. This moisturizer made my skin extremely soft from the first use. I use it on clean skin every day, and I feel very happy with my soft skin. Tara Harper moisturizer is ideal to use after using a rich serum because it locks the serum on the surface of the skin as long as possible. However, I felt a bit itchy after using it. It could be because of the ingredients. The ingredients could be improved to suit all skin types. Overall, great moisturizer."

			"review_text": "I am in love with  Tata Harper  Water-Lock Moisturizer. It comes in a beautifully designed, eco-friendly refillable jar. The packaging is not only aesthetically pleasing but also aligns with sustainable practices, which I deeply appreciate. The pump mechanism ensures hygienic dispensing, though it sometimes dispenses more product than needed, so a little caution is required.  The moisturizer has a lightweight, gel-cream texture that feels incredibly refreshing upon application. It glides effortlessly over the skin and absorbs quickly without leaving any greasy residue. This makes it perfect for layering under sunscreen and makeup. I love that it provides a smooth, velvety finish, making my skin feel instantly hydrated and plump. From the first use, I noticed a significant boost in my skin’s hydration levels. The Water-Lock Moisturizer does an excellent job of locking in moisture, keeping my skin feeling supple and hydrated throughout the day. It's particularly effective during transitional weather when my skin tends to get drier. Tata Harper is known for her commitment to natural, non-toxic ingredients, and this moisturizer is no exception.  I have sensitive skin that can react to new products, but I experienced no irritation or breakouts with the Water-Lock Moisturizer. It’s gentle yet effective, making it suitable for daily use. The product's clean formulation is likely a key factor in its compatibility with sensitive skin.  My skin looks and feels more hydrated, smoother, and has a healthy glow. I've noticed a reduction in dry patches and an overall improvement in skin texture."

As time has gone by. I have noticed that my skin has been a little more on the dryer side. Since I also use retinol in my routine and that can be drying. I feel like that contributes to it as well. I have really enjoyed using this product at the end of my routine, both daytime and nighttime. I feel like it helps bring in moisture back into my skin.

I’m a desert-dweller and professional skincare writer, so I’m embarrassed to say that this product is the first I’ve tried from Tata Harper. Lately, I have an appreciation for pump-style jars because they’re more sanitary and easy to carry when traveling.   For my skin (fundamentally normal but skews dry due to Retin A usage) two pumps are sufficient to hydrate my face, neck, and decolletage. Tata Harper’s Water Lock Moisturizer has a beautiful light citrus scent and absorbs into the skin quickly. It doesn’t interfere with sunscreen or makeup either … just be sure to let it absorb completely.   Closing Thoughts: I’m especially pleased with its silky texture and inclusion of orange peptides, which lock in hydration and make skin look more smooth. The brand made this as a refillable jar, so I will probably buy a refill when next summer rolls around."

Its creamy texture melts quickly into my skin without leaving it heavy or with a greasy residue, and it has a very strong floral fragrance that does have a tendency to stick around for a while.

It also helps my skin to retain moisture without causing me any irritation or breakouts and works so well at prepping my skin for my makeup application. This is definitely an all-around moisturizer that lives up to its claims of keeping my skin moisturizered and my makeup fresh throughout the entire day. It does have some ingredients that can cause skin sensitivity to the sun, so I always make sure to protect my skin and limit my exposure while wearing it. I would recommend to all skin types as long as you are not sensitive to fragrances!"

As an avid runner, post-workout skincare is incredibly important and this moisturizer has become a staple in my routine. After my daily morning run, I apply 2-3 pumps to my face, treating it like a mask while my pores are still open. While I attend to chores around the house for about 30 minutes, it works its magic, leaving my skin smooth, soft, and deeply hydrated. It effectively combats roughness, dryness, and dullness. I appreciate its use of ingredients like orange peptides, pomegranate spheres, and macro hyaluronic acid, that together prime and smooth my skin. I also appreciate its versatility- I use it as a makeup primer on days I want to achieve a dewy glow that lasts all day. To maximize results, I alternate between using this moisturizer and Tata Harper’s Resurfacing Mask. On even days, I go for my daily run and use the Water Lock Moisturizer to indulge in its smoothing effects, and on odd days, I indulge in the rejuvenating effects of the Resurfacing Mask. This alternating routine keeps my skin looking young, vibrant, blemish-free, and feeling oh-so-soft! I recommend this for anyone who wants to achieve smoother more supple, hydrated skin or is looking for a primer that provides a dewy finish."

All that is needed for application is one pump as a little truly goes a long way, like with all Tata's products. Oh, and the pump! I love how it pumps out instead of having to put the moisturizer on my hands and apply it. I feel that it's much more sterile and healthier for the skin this way!

The jar in and of itself is impressive! The push-pump container helps with not releasing more than you'll need. It's also refillable! When distributing the lotion onto my face, it absorbs effortlessly. My face is left feeling soft to the touch. It's important to apply sunscreen, cover up with clothing that's going to protect, and limit your time in the sun when in use of this product. Preferably for at least a week. The reason for this is that the cream contains alpha hydroxy acid. The skin can be prone to sunburn and sensitivity to the sun. I certainly recommend Tata Harper's Water Lock Moisturizer for those who are wanting a lightweight, silicone-free (hydrator that primes), deliciously scented, and a cream that glides onto the face seamlessly; leaving the face feeling and looking flawless. You'll thank me later!"

I am loving the evolution of skincare to include more organic ingredients and plant-powered oils and extracts. I was pleasantly surprised when reviewing the ingredient deck for the Water-Lock Moisturizer! It is packed with extracts and ingredients like arnica, lactic acid, elderberry, calendula, beet root, shea butter, and one of my favorites-meadowsweet! I found the moisturizer to be hydrating without being too oily or almost greasy feeling, like some moisturizers with shea butter often do. I like that airless pump design of the packaging is both hygienic (since you aren’t touching the product in the jar) AND is more sustainable, since you can remove the inner part and replace that when you run out of product-meaning that the outer glass jar can continue to be reused indefinitely!"

It’s a lightweight silicone free hydrator that primes and soothes with orange peptide,pomegranate spheres and Macro hyaluronic acid! It’s best for dullness ,roughness/uneven skin and texture.This moisturizer is for normal and combination and oily skin.This moisturizer also addresses these skin concerns…dryness,dullness and uneven skin tones. So now I’m going to talk about the highlighted ingredients in this moisturizer..The Marco Hyaluronic Acid absorbs moisture and provides a conditioning effect for soft ,hydrated and healthy looking glow!Then you have Orange blossom peptides that support the skin’s natural barrier to aid with water retention and hydration. Then last but not least Pomegranate Spheres that absorb moisture to provide sustained hydration that can be locked into the skin! My 35 year old skin has never felt better!"

The pump dispenser is so awesome so I know exactly how much to apply to my skin. Once I put it on, it absorbs quickly and doesn’t make my skin feel greasy or heavy. The light citrusy scent makes it feel fresh and it makes my skin feel nice and plump. Great for wearing under makeup, I love that the moisturizer is constantly working to make your skin better, including ingredients like AHA and hyaluronic acid. Even with those ingredients, I never have any kind of irritation or rosacea from the moisturizer, which is a real testament to the gentleness of the product. This is definitely my new favorite hot-weather moisturizer!"

Those of you who dislike dipping fingers into moisturizer jars, will really appreciate the packaging.  This moisturizer, with its lightweight consistency, absorbs rapidly and leaves no sticky or greasy residue behind. It feels amazing on my dry skin, especially when applied after using the Resurfacing Mask. Living up to its name, the Water-Lock Moisturizer effectively seals in moisture, leaving my skin feeling plump and refreshed. Its dual function as a primer is a bonus, simplifying my skincare routine and aligning with the less-is-more philosophy.  Thanks to its lightweight formula, Water-Lock Moisturizer is ideal for the hotter summer month, or year round if you live in a hot and humid region like I do."

The scent was light and pleasant, and it matched the light texture of the moisturizer perfectly. I liked how it kept my skin hydrated all day.Peptides are important for keeping skin firm as we age, so I was happy to see them in the moisturizer. It absorbed quickly and didn't feel greasy, leaving my skin looking dewy and plump. The moisturizer improved the health and appearance of my skin, making it smoother, softer, and more glowy. I appreciated the pump packaging, which made it easy to use just the right amount of product. While I liked that the jar is refillable, I think there should be a way better price difference between buying a new jar and getting a refill."

			"review_text": "I am a beauty enthusiast and skincare lover in my late 30s! I was very excited to try the Tata Harper Water Lock Moisturizer! This lightweight moisturizer primes and hydrates the skin with orange peptides, pomegranate spheres, and macro hyaluronic acid.  The Tata Harper Water Lock Moisturizer is great for people with roughness/uneven texture, dry skin, or skin that is dull.  I really loved the design of the 1.7 oz reusable jar that was super eco friendly coming with a refillable pod. You only need a couple of pumps and a little bit goes a long way! The moisturizer felt super ultra light weight on my skin. It had a pleasant herbal citrus plant smell. This moisturizer is actually a moisturizer-primer hybrid, so you only need one step. It smoothes the skin locking in moisture and preps the skin for any makeup! I do advise this product may not be for people who have very ultra sensitive skin because this moisturizer contains lactic acid or alpha hydroxy acid (AHA) which helps with skin cell turnover or helping smooth rough skin texture but can increase sunburn sensitivity. So, this product may sting for some people. I highly recommend wearing sunscreen also with this moisturizer or avoiding direct sunlight or uv rays.  My personal experience with the Tata Harper Water Lock Moisturizer is that I didn’t notice immediate positive results with this moisturizer. I was disappointed in this moisturizer. At times, it left my skin a little dry and tight instead of my skin locked in with deep hydration. I have been using the Tata Harper Water Lock Moisturizer along with the Tata Harper clarifying cleanser.  I think this moisturizer is still great for people with are looking to smooth rough textured skin but don’t have sensitive skin. This moisturizer might not be suitable for some people especially sensitive skin or sensitive to alpha hydroxy acid."

It really helps keep portions in the correct amount which saves you money and keeps you from using too much product. The packaging is pretty and elegant and eco smart by being refillable. The texture of the Tata Harper Water Lock Moisturizer is great and very light weight and absorbs quickly into the skin just like you would Ike and expect. Here is my major negative review of this product, it has a strong floral fragrance to it. If you’re someone sensitive to fragrances on your face you will not care for this product. It gave me an almost instant migraine and even after I washed it off I could still smell it for hours. I did unfortunately, develop some hives on cheeks and few days later rosacea flared pretty badly. My responses are from extremely sensitive skin to fragrances so someone could use it a be completely fine an enjoy the product"

This luxurious moisturizer comes in a beautifully designed green and gold jar with a pump that can be refilled, making it not only effective but also environmentally friendly. Its lightweight formula has a pleasant fragrance and gets absorbed quickly into the skin after application, leaving behind a radiant, glowy finish. Besides being an excellent moisturizer, I have used it as a primer before applying makeup, and it has worked wonders for me. What's more, the moisturizer contains AHA, which helps brighten the skin, making it perfect for all skin types.

I have been using the Water-Lock Moisturizer by Tata Harper for alittle over a week now. And I truly enjoy using this moisturizer everyday on my skin. This has definitely made my skin smoother and more supple.  This moisturizer comes in 1.7 fl oz/ 50 ml container. I apply this moisturizer in the morning after washing my face with the Clarifying Cleanser from Tata Harper. I feel like these two products work so well together.  I like the consistency of this moisturizer as its perfect- neither too thick nor too runny. This moisturizer is lightweight and quickly absorbs into my skin, leaving no residue or sticky after feeling. I also like the fragrance of this moisturizer. It has a very mild flowery smell to it which is definitely very pleasant.  I like that I don't need a whole lot of product to get the benefits of this moisturizer. I gently push down and it  dispenses the right amount of product every time. With this moisturizer a little goes a long way as I only need two pumps for my entire face and neck.  I rate this moisturizer a perfect 5 stars and highly recommend to all those who are looking for a product made with high quality ingredients that will leave their skin softer, smoother, and hydrated.  **This review was collected as part of a promotion."

Your moisturizer is meant to nourish and protect your skin but if you’re using actives and there’s more actives in your moisturizer and sunscreen, your skin is going to write a tell all book about how mean you are. Haha! I gave this 3 stars because I think it would be alright for those not using actives. My experience was not good. First, there was no sample so I could smell it or feel the texture. I got home and put it on. I like a light citrus scent but this was more like getting hit in the face with a shovel. My eyes were watering so bad I looked like a member of the Kiss band as my “natural beauty” ran down my face. The pilling really completed the look I was going for as I’m blindly trying to find my way to the bathroom to wash it off.

I get home and look at the box and there is a sunburn warning on the side. I check the ingredients and see lactic acid. Ugh! I am so sick of brands doing this. There is NO reason that a daily use product that is left on (serum or cream) should have an AHA or BHA in it, absolutely no reason. A cleanser, fine. A product for use once or twice a week, sure. But a daily moisturizer? Absolutely not. This will hurt your barrier. I don't care if it's called water lock or that it contains peptides. They ruined it with that AHA. They likely included it because it gives an immediate glow, but I strongly do not recommend this bc of that lactic acid. Otherwise it would have been a win for combo skin in a humid climate in the summer. Tata Harper fail."

It feels protective and definitely keeps moisture in the skin all day long. I live in a very humid climate, and do not have air-conditioning, so I am extremely picky about my summer moisturizers – gels are never moisturizing enough for me or end up being sticky, and creams are too heavy for summer. This water lock moisturizer is ideal. I also love the pump jar! It dispenses the perfect amount of product and keeps germs out. Gifted by Tata Harper Skincare."

This moisturizer has an almost blurring/primer effect on the skin and pairs well with all of my other skincare and makeup  products.  The push top and refillable packaging is a huge bonus especially since the jar itself is so beautiful and durable. I don’t need to worry about contamination or feel guilty about throwing the jar away when it’s empty since all that gets tossed is the smaller jar housing the product. I’d recommend this moisturizer to anyone, young and old. It’s versatile and effective!"

I think the packaging is brilliant too, I love that with the refill system it helps keep plastics out of the landfill, there’s nothing I don’t love about this Water-Lock Moisturizer, it’s a total dream for my dry skin type! I received this complimentary from Tata Harper Skincare."

I love the Tata Harper glass packaging and that was honestly part of why I invested in this cream, disappointed to see it is plastic.

The packaging has not given me problems yet but based on reviews that may change. I would recommend this for normal/oily as well as sensitive skin if you have very dry skin I would look elsewhere while this does give my skin a plump dewy feeling it’s not the most moisturizing product I’ve used.

However, I didn’t really noticing much of a skin smoothing effect, which I was really hoping for. If there was any, it was minimal. It’s a good moisturizer, but I wasn’t left feeling blown away by it. The packaging, on the other hand, is pretty perfect. I love the design and think the packaging is beautiful and feels quality.

If you have a ton of cash to blow on facial care, you are better of with La Mer (consistently high reviews, world wide praise, and results to justify the price) or alternatively, most of the Tatcha product line.

It has a floral fragrance that isn’t super strong but I would proceed with caution if you are sensitive to fragrance.

It makes me curious about the brand and excited to try other products. I will say a con is that it is a refillable container, so it had to be assembled. It was a little tricky to align it right so that the pump would work properly. I will add that because it contains AHAs and may make skin more sensitive to the sun, I might try a different one of their moisturizers without it next."

I was concerned, however, that the product might not work if oxidized or whatever and wrote the company to inquire. But it's been a few weeks and no one has responded, which is really shoddy customer service when their product does not work as advertised.  Not sure I will buy again if I don't hear back."

Keeping my skin hydrated has always been a challenge because my skin gets dehydrated very easily but this has truly made a difference. It’s retextured my skin and I can tell after using 2x a day that my skin is retaining moisture longer than with other moisturizers. I can also say that I haven’t gotten any new blemishes in the weeks I’ve been using this. I would say it’s a light to medium weight moisturizer and using 2x a day one pump each time I think this should last me 6-8 weeks at a minimum. One pump is also enough to do my neck. The comments on the smell are confusing to me because it smells pretty unscented to me and I love citrus so I was hoping it would smell more orange-y than it does. I think this is a great staple and while I do wish it cost less I understand why based on the ingredients that it’s priced on the higher side."

Price point wise,  it is an investment into your skin, but healthy always comes at a price doesn't it?  In this case you truly get what you pay for which is quality and it's worth the price. The emollients are all natural, do not sit heavily on the skin, and are rapidly and thoroughly absorbed quickly..although I recommend applying fresh out the shower.

So when I think about it I know I have a product on and I know that it is working.  I am wondering as I use this product how the design of the pump will work as there is no straw to the bottom that allows you to get the product out. I believe it is all by suction. So when you get to the end you may have to eventually use something to retrieve the rest of your product. The product itself feels like a normal face lotion on my fingers. If they took this to the next level I would love for them to add a cooling effect to it. I may just put it in the fridge. Overall I like this product. I received this free/discount from Tata Harper for review.   The price did not influence my review.  My review of this product is based on my opinion of the product."

Recently I tried out this Water Lock moisturizer with skin smoothing peptides from Tata Harper, and I wanted to share my review with you. I personally have normal/combination skin and I'm always looking for new skincare products to try. This lightweight moisturizer claims to add moisture using water locking technology, is silicone free, and features orange peptides and pomegranate spheres to smooth skin. As far as the use of the product, I felt like it applies really well and does smooth and soften my skin without the use of silicone which is an ingredient I try to avoid. It feels hydrating and I can tell there is orange oil in it because you can smell it. It's a light smell, but honestly it bothers my eyes just a little bit and I'm not sure I'd continue using it for that reason. The other thing about this product is the sustainable use container. You get the initial jar and the refill for the jar in the package when you purchase it, and assemble the product. When you run out, instead of throwing away the whole thing you just buy a new refill pod and recycle the old one. While I think this is a really cool concept, even after watching the video on how to use the product and assemble it mine didn't go together very well. The threads didn't match up and it was hard to assemble the first time. I also don't like the press-down dispenser of this product even though it is supposed to be more hygienic than a jar you dip your fingers into. I just like to stick to pump dispensers or regular containers. Overall this isn't a bad product but I can't really say it's one of my favorites either. I probably wouldn't buy it after this runs out."

Once opening the box the pieces came separate so you have to open the cream and put the top on it, which is nice knowing it is sealed. I'm not sure if it's just mine or the design but my product does not screw all the way together. I do really like that Tata Harper produces 100% natural and non toxic formulas using as many advanced green technologies as possible. When it comes to the design, I do like that they offer removable pods so you can insert a replacement pod. The biggest thing I liked about the packaging was the top, it resembles a mirror so you can use this product wherever you are and still see where to apply it. Once opening it I noticed a strong grass and flower scent, which I am not fond of. However, I was very impressed with how light weight this cream is. It is very hydrating and feels excellent on my skin. The scent does fade and doesn't linger which is a huge plus.

My makeup applies easier and more evenly. The only downside to this product that I've found is the scent. The fragrance is a little on the strong side and smells like a mix of citrus peel and flower pollen, to me. The good news is, that it disappears very quickly (as soon as it absorbs) and you don't notice it anymore. I think this is a very nice moisturizer, but wish they'd change the fragrance.

The moisturizer is very light, gentle on the skin and absorbing well into the skin. I have a combination skin and it worked really well. But I have to be honest after about a week of using this in the morning and evening my skin started breaking out here and there. Although, i live in a very humid location (Texas) and maybe the combination of this moisturizer and humidity did it. I also used it on my neck and noticed some of the fine lines were disappearing. The packaging has it's plus and minuses. The design is beautiful and well thought through as far as only buying refills and replacing the pods but I'll be quite honest I had quite the difficult time closing the jar with the pod of refill. Otherwise, great idea to prevent contamination and easy press of a button and get a little bit at a time of the moisturizer. Overall,  still a great product I would recommend! I did receive complimentary product from Tata Harper for testing and review."

I have combination facial skin and with having to wear masks, the area around my mouth gets extra dry. After cleansing my face, I apply the moisturizer. It glides on smoothly on my skin and and absorbs without leaving my skin feeling sticky. Another great thing about this product is the packaging. The moisturizer is contained in a capsule that you insert in the jar and top with the pump that will expell the moisturizer when pressing down in it. I thought this was really neat. Once all the moisturizer is gone, you just have to remove the capsule and buy a replacement capsule. Thus creates less waste since you are not having to buy a whole new jar."

However, after using this product for about a week, I’ve finally managed to gather my thoughts and write a review. This product has a smell of oranges and grass, in that order. I’ll be the first to say, I prefer fragrance free skincare. But, I noticed some ingredients that I loved, so I thought I could ignore the fragrance. It doesn’t smell bad at all. However, three days after I started using this morning and night, I noticed my skin started breaking out around my chin and mouth. This is the only new product I introduced to my routine lately, so it definitely was the moisturizer. When putting it on, it felt smooth, so I was disappointed in the results. I don’t wear makeup, but I imagine it would “feel” hydrating. However, there are a couple things I love about this product. I love the refillable system, it’s so environmentally friendly, and it’s amazing that a large brand would implement this. I appreciate the effort!! Overall, this product was mediocre at best, but I do have a lot of respect for the brands approach to being environmentally conscious."

I hate using silicone on my skin, but I do because it gives that perfect smoothness...this delivers perfect smoothness without the silicones. It has a light clean scent reminiscent of oranges, probably due to the orange water in the ingredients. I have combination skin, and am in a constant struggle to find an appropriate moisturizer that doesn’t make me greasy. This definitely fits the bill!

During the day it’s highly recommended that you wear sunscreen and try to limit sun exposure, since it contains peptides. This moisturizer is tacky enough to use as a primer as well!

This moisturizer feels AMAZING. For a cream with no silicones, it glides on like silk(thanks to orange peptides and pomegranote spheres!)- And it absorbs fully into the skin in minutes, with no oily or tacky feeling left-over on your skin.  It works for all skin types, but my skin is SUPER DRY and this made a huge difference with the first application.

It feels smooth going on and a little does spread well all over face and neck. This does not feel greasy, and I've had no problems with the product making my face break out, or sensitivity.

I may use this often in cold weather months it will be perfect for my dry skin. I highly recommend this to anyone!!"

This lightweight, silicone-free moisturizer has a unique water-locking technology to give your skin balanced hydration. It primes and smoothes the skin with natural peptides and hyaluronic acid. Key Benefits:  Pomegranate Spheres absorb moisture and lock in sustained hydration.  Orange Blossom Peptides support the skin’s natural barrier and aid with water retention and hydration.  Macro Hyaluronic Acid absorbs moisture and provides a soft, hydrated, healthy-looking appearance.  Sugar Carbohydrate Complex binds water to improve hydration and supports the skin’s barrier. My thoughts: My first time this brand and I was very impressed! I have combination, acne-prone skin and it did not irritate it. The texture is luxurious and applies evenly giving my skin a silky feel, even though it’s silicone-free. I absolutely love the scent, which smells like fresh cut flowers with a hint of citrus...SO relaxing! It acts as both a primer AND moisturizer, so no need for multiple products! When applied under makeup I found it to be smoothing and did not pill. It’s packaged within an airless pump jar, so you don’t have to worry about scooping it out. You massage 1 to 2 pumps onto the face and neck, both AM & PM. I appreciate the sustainable refill system that has a unique refillable pod to reduce overall waste. When you run out, you can simply get the refill pod that provides 30 days of use, allowing you to save 11 jars from going into the landfill each year!!! This product is also vegan, cruelty-free, gluten-free, and comes in recyclable packaging. It’s safe to say I’ve quickly become a fan and can’t wait to see how it benefits my skin with continued use."

But at the same time I feel that the price difference between just the refill or the full container should be bigger. Anyway, I would definitely buy the refill anyway, even if it were the same price. Overall, this feels pretty luxurious without  breaking the bank. I’m a fan. I had a bit of trouble getting used to the pump in the package, but after some uses it got better. The first couple of uses I got either too much or too little product with each pump.

The texture is light and it goes onto my skin very smoothly. The peptides included in the formulation make my skin look smooth and my pores look smaller as well. The scent is light, and not unpleasant. As this product has an AHA in it, it's absolutely vital to use a sunscreen with this to decrease photosensitivity. It blends well with sunscreen and doesn't pill when other products are applied over it.   The idea of a refillable pod is very interesting, and something I've never seen before. When assembling, be sure to remove the foil from the pod containing the product, then to snap just the pod into the bottom of the cap first before screwing the cap and pump onto the external jar."

It’s feels really nice on the skin, not tacky or anything which is what I look for in a moisturizer. And the best part? It does last! I usually carry a mini version of my moisturizer around because my skin is so dry that I have to reapply so I don’t get dry patches during the day! And this works! What I also like is that you can refill it, specially since this is will be a staple in my skin care routine I like to be able to refill this.  My skin felt smoother and plumper, and did not interfere with my foundation which is a plus. It isn’t oily either! Love love love this product!"

Also the sustainable refill system is simply genius! I typically do a lot of research on a products sustainably missions and Tata Harper meets it! I followed my normal skincare routine, but added the Water-Lock Moisturizer before adding my skin oil and OMG what a difference! I always thought that I was using my oil products wrong, but I think this product has taught me that my products simply don't have enough moisture built in. I really love this product, but I really don't like the smell of citrus, so that is honestly the only deal breaker for me. Depending on how great my skin does over the next month, I may just have to learn to love the smell because the product feels amazing! It has also looks fantastic under my makeup."

WARNING: once you use it, you’ll never want to use anything else. Tata Harper hit a home run with this formula. The texture is sublime. It absorbes and leaves your skin hydrated but not oily. This is a truly modern approach to skin care. It feels great knowing that you can take care of your skin with a luxurious product, from a brand that cares about the planet. A win win on my book!"

			"review_text": "If you're a fan of DE Protini I think you'll love this as well. The two are very similar in both texture and finish. I would say this moisturizer is slightly more hydrating and I find I need to use very little product which is great. This does have a citrus scent but I don't find it overpowering and the smell fades immediately after application. I LOVE the packaging and the fact that its refillable - major props to Tata Harper for this! I did experience pilling one time but I would attribute it to user error since I haven't had issues since. I can't speak to its priming benefits as I haven't worn makeup recently but I find moisturizer is the best primer for dry skin so I would imagine it works great (for reference I have dry sensitive skin)"

No greasy feeling, no tackiness and not heavy. I seal my essence with this and wake up with soft hydrated skin. Smells like orange blossoms. One star deducted for the price. For people that break out from dimethicone and coconut alkanes, this is the solution!"
