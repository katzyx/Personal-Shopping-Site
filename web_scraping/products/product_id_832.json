It is slightly sticky though, especially when it dries down, but realistically I think no hydrating lip oil is 100% non-sticky so I don't mind it. The shine seems to last up to an hour for me before I need to reapply, but the hydration lasts for way longer. It has a strong fruity fig scent which I love but may not be ideal for people sensitive to fragrance. Overall I think it's better than the other lip oils I've tried so far (Dior, Rare beauty, Elf, Clarins) in terms of longevity, hydration, non-stickiness, tint, and packaging."

Its hydrating, perfect amount of pigment, layers good with other products, and smells amazing. I took away one star because it is a bit sticky. Definitely more of a gloss-lip oil combination. Also, the smell is really strong, so if your sensitive to smell, I would pass on buying this. This size is also extremely small, unfortunately. And it only lasts about 30 minutes before reapplying."

It feels nourishing on the lips and doesn‚Äôt just sit on top which I hate. I was pleasantly surprised by the very subtle cooling sensation on initial application. I love the fat applicator and the adorable little bauble inside the top of the component- very cutesy, very Kaja. I chose the shade Fig Smoothie and I‚Äôm so glad I did. It‚Äôs a neutral, slightly milky nude that‚Äôs right up my alley. My lips have never looked juicier! I will definitely be picking up another shade in the near future.."

The consistency is ideal and doesn‚Äôt feel sticky when applied.  The scent is quite appealing to me.  It makes the product really fun to wear."

On the lips it isnt sticky - it makes my lips look bigger and plumper without the stinging feeling of a lip plumper. It‚Äôs very hydrating so I use it throughout the day to relieve my dry lips."

The lip oil provides a subtle plumping effect, which is nice since it doesn‚Äôt have that harsh, burning sensation that some plumping products have. However, the oil settles a little sticky on the lips rather than feeling smooth, though it still manages to be hydrating. The color payoff is very subtle‚Äîit adds more of a tint than a full wash of color, which gives a natural, glossy look. Overall, it‚Äôs a decent lip oil if you‚Äôre looking for light plumping and hydration, but the stickiness might be a drawback for some."

It‚Äôs a super juicy and thick and lip oil that smells like apples, so it‚Äôs super yummy~ It‚Äôs also slightly tacky, but that‚Äôs what makes the high shine gloss finish last for hours! Careful not to smack your lips together if you get anything wet on your lips, the moisturizing ingredients might turn white for a few minutes before disappearing. A swatch of the lip oil on my arm comes out red, but if you have a slight purplish undertone on your lips, it will turn into this super natural and cute pink color. Highly recommend!!"

I tried it on and nothing..You get a slight minty sensation like when you chew gum but it goes away fast and it's very faint. It's too small for the price. I'll definitely be exchanging it for something else. Not worth the money."

I love when a brand puts out exciting and different colors so obviously I had to try out The Juicy Glass Lip Oil in Grape Glowtini since it's purple. The packaging is super cute, I love the little details Kaja puts into their products to give a magical moment; for the Juicy Glass Lip Oil that's a heart bead in the top of the tube that reflects rainbows. The doe foot is huge and soft so I feel like I'm getting enough product every time I use it and I get full coverage on each lip with one swipe a piece. The scent is phenomenal, just like a PB&J sandwich! (And not for nothing it tastes good too.) The color itself is a very light wash, it looks like an ethereal glow. There's a touch of purple but unless you pair it over something with cool tones it's very minimal so there's a lot of room to play and mix and match for a more dramatic or subtle wash of color. It is indeed juicy, and sits almost like water on the lips, it actively feels hydrating and gentle. It's got a bit of a shorter lifespan for wear but it's a lip oil not a stick or gloss so it'll absorb throughout the day. The high gloss sticks to every curve and nook giving a 3D plumping effect. My one change I might make is that once you take the applicator out of the tube it really looks like you're getting less product because the foot takes up so much space, which is a bit of a bummer because I want to get a ton of use out of it because I'm really digging it!  All-in-all it would be worth the buy for me and I want to collect all of them. A super light and refreshing lip oil that definitely delivers and looks cute doing it. I am thankful to Kaja for gifting the Grape Glowtini Juicy Glass Lip Oil to me so that I could test it out!"

I got the shade Grape Glowtini because I love the color of it, it has a slight fruity scent that I enjoy but my favorite part of the product is the applicator because the shape of it is great for application.The product isn‚Äôt sticky or thick on the lips, it‚Äôs very comfortable to wear and provides a nice shine. I didn‚Äôt know this was a plumping oil but it doesn‚Äôt have that uncomfortable plumping sensation thankfully because I don‚Äôt like those, I did notice that my lips looked a bit more plump while also staying nice and hydrated! I also think the packaging is so cute, I love the little heart in the cap, it‚Äôs such a nice touch. Can‚Äôt wait to get more of these because I love this product!"

On the contrary, it actually is pretty hydrating and it‚Äôs a lifesaver for winter months.  I find it being very comfortable and not sticky, so wearing it all day with reapplications is quite pleasant. I have the shade grape glowtini and it definitely has a pleasant subtle grape smell, plus the purple sheen makes my smile look brighter.  Overall, I‚Äôd definitely recommend this if you‚Äôre looking for a lip oil, I might even get more colors in the future.  Packaging is also very adorable."

What I have not perceived at all is that it plumping up my lips, unless only the first visual effect after the application is meant. I feel there are products that achieve that better."

When I first applied this lip oil, I immediately noticed a gentle tingling sensation. It's not uncomfortable, just enough to let you know it's working its magic. After a short while, my lips started to look naturally plump, and the effect was impressive. It's like having fuller lips without any invasive procedures. The initial glossy finish is stunning, giving your lips a luscious shine. However, it transforms over time. As the lustrous sheen subsides, your lips gradually return to their natural shade, but the hydration remains. It is a fantastic feature as it lets you enjoy the plumped effect without feeling like you're wearing too much makeup. This lip oil is an excellent choice for plump, hydrated lips with a natural-looking gloss. I highly recommend trying it out for a fresh and radiant lip look."

It does give my lips a slight plumping effect but nothing crazy over the top and since it is a plumping product it does come with that sliggt tingly feeling I love and look for in these products. It smells quite nice and goes on nicely and I like the big applicator and cute packaging"

Since it‚Äôs plumping, I was a little worried, but the tingle was barely noticeable and the results made my lips feel full and soft. The formula has no taste and a minimal scent, but a very hydrating finish that‚Äôs long-lasting. The sheer shade provides just a touch of color and life to my lips, too.

			"review_text": "I was excited to try the NEW Juicy Glass Lip Oil, I was looking into testing a lip oil for a few weeks already. I liked the idea of testing a lip oil that gives you a glossy shine and hydration. I ordered the shade Rose Hip Spritz, which is described as a sheer pink with a hint of red.  When the product arrived, I was surprised to see that the color in the bottle was more red than pink. However, when I applied the lip oil to my lips, it was much sheerer than it appeared in the bottle. It did give my lips a nice, natural flush of pink with a glossy shine, and I liked it.   The lip oil also felt really good on my lips. It was lightweight and non-sticky, and it kept my lips feeling hydrated. I didn't have any problems with my hair getting stuck on it, either. I reapplied it every 1 hour or so, but I tend to 'eat' my lipsticks and balms all the time, so it might last longer on other people.   Overall, I am really impressed with the NEW Juicy Glass Lip Oil. It gives my lips a beautiful, glossy shine and hydration, and the color is perfect for everyday wear. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone looking for a new lip oil."

It claims to plump and I can definitely see a bit of plumpness without it being exaggerated but the best part is it doesn't tingle as other plumping glosses do. It truly does have a high shine which I love and goes well on its own or with any other lipstick. It's not sticky and leaves my lips feeling very hydrated. I noticed the gloss lasts me about 2.5 to 3 hrs without drinking or eating and after it disappears, my lips feel so soft and hydrated. The doe-foot applicator is a little chubby but it applies great to the lips and also as you are pulling out the product, it sort of hugs the applicator so you don't get excessive product out which doesn't waste it nor does it get messy around the lid. I didn't find that it had any color even though it's purple unless it's very unnoticeable. I love it just as it is. The packaging is also very cute with the little charm on the lid, it gives it a nice touch."

The applicator is perfect size and goes on smoothly. I was expecting to feel a tiny bit of tingling since its supposed to plump lips & I didn't feel that. I saw maybe a tad bit of plumping (barely) but it didn't last long. I actually loved the look of it once applied, unfortunately it didn't last long, AT ALL. I feel like I would have to reapply it constantly & the bottle is pretty small, doesn't seem like a lot of product.

It's a very subtle tint but it's flattering. The texture feels like it's somewhere between a gloss and an oil as it is just slightly sticky. After an hour or two, my lips are both a bit dry and a little sticky somehow. I didn't notice any smell, but I accidentally licked my lips and it tasted like an unflavored chapstick (a bit unpleasant). I didn't notice any plumping effect, but I do have full lips."

The bottle itself is cute & has a large applicator to easily apply it. The tint gave my lips a faint color which I was hoping for. To me, it feels like a lip gloss more so than an oil. It has a very slight sticky feeling like a gloss & a light tingle for the plumping effect. But not like a plumping lip gloss that can sometimes give a burning sensation. It was more of a light cooling effect. The taste was the only downfall for me. It gave me a floral perfume taste that I just couldn‚Äôt get past. If it would have been a more fruity scent/taste then it would have been a home run for me."

The smell is so bomb and long lasting i keep trying to smell my lips lol, The oil goes on clear and changes quickly to a very natural rose color! The oil is a combo of oil and gloss texture its not to thick but also not runny at all its a perfect formula in my opinion. The applicator also allows you to get the perfect amount of product in one dip you dont have to do so many coats but you definitely can if you want! which i love! Also the packaging is super adorable!! Theres a heart shaped charm inside the cap thats so cute! 10/10 definitely recommend and im buying ALL the flavors now! Gifted By Kaja"

The packaging is cute, with a little heart in the cap, but it does rattle around which might annoy some people. The lip oil feels nice on and smells good, though it doesn‚Äôt last that long (I don‚Äôt really expect products like this to be long lasting). Since every brand is coming out with lip oils lately, this one doesn‚Äôt seem that special but if the color and/or packaging appeals to you, I don‚Äôt think you‚Äôd be disappointed in the quality."

			"review_text": "I recently tried the Kaja Raspberry Refresher Juicy Glass Lip Oil, and I am absolutely thrilled with my purchase! This product has exceeded all my expectations, and I can't wait to share my thoughts. First and foremost, let's talk about the scent ‚Äì it's nothing short of amazing! The moment I twisted open the cap, I was greeted by the delightful aroma of fresh raspberries. It's like a burst of summer in a bottle. Every time I apply this lip oil, I can't help but smile as the sweet and tangy scent envelops my senses. It's not overpowering but adds a subtle, delicious note that lingers throughout the day. Now, let's discuss the shade of this lip oil. I opted for the Raspberry Refresher shade, and I must say it's a perfect choice. The color is a beautiful, sheer tint of pink that enhances my natural lip color with a hint of raspberry goodness. It gives my lips a healthy, natural-looking flush that works well for both casual and more dressed-up occasions. I appreciate how it complements my everyday makeup looks, adding that extra touch of allure. The best part, though, is how this lip oil feels on my lips. It's like a burst of hydration for my lips, instantly quenching any dryness or chapping. The texture is incredibly smooth, not sticky or greasy at all. It glides on effortlessly, providing a glossy finish that makes my lips look plump and luscious. I love how it adds a beautiful shine without feeling heavy or uncomfortable. Plus, it's so lightweight that I almost forget I'm wearing anything on my lips ‚Äì it's that comfortable! The Kaja Raspberry Refresher Juicy Glass Lip Oil has quickly become a staple in my beauty routine. I have included pictures below showing a side to side of it applied and one side not. As well as applied fully!"

It remind me of a strawberry candy from my childhood. I feel a slight tingle but the overall application is smooth and non-sticky. The best part of this product is the cute packaging. The heart bead is a nice addition."

			"review_text": "Honestly, Kaja named this product perfectly because Glassy, Juicy, Lip Oil is EXACTLY what it is! You get that perfect juicy look to the lips with a gorgeous glassy shine but the product is not sticky like a lipgloss, it has that hydrating and slick lip oil feel. With that said, this is a product you‚Äôll probably need to reapply due to its ‚Äúlack of stickiness‚Äù, but I personally don‚Äôt mind that.  I can‚Äôt quite pinpoint the scent but it is mild and fruity without being overly sweet. I was gifted the shade Raspberry Refresher and it‚Äôs a perfect pinky coral on me. The amount of color payoff you get with this shade is exactly what I want in a tinted lip oil. Not too bold, but not nothing. Right in between!"
