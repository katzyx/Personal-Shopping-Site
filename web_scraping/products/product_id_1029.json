	"about": "Fragrance Family:Florals.Scent Type:Warm Florals.Key Notes:Jasmine, Bulgarian Rose, Vanilla Flower..Fragrance Description:No.14 Icila, a warm floral fragrance opens with top notes of ruby pamplemousse, Mandarin leaf, and jasmine. At its heart are dark plum, vanilla, and Sakura blossoms. A base of warm, sultry woods and sweet floral blossoms leave a shimmering effect, reminding you there is no better moment than now..About the Fragrance:Inspired by the French word ici, meaning here, this intoxicating scent demonstrates that every fleeting second is sacred. Icila reminds us of the gift of time that should never be taken for granted..Clean & Planet Aware:Our ambitious curation of beauty made without controversial ingredients from brands dedicated to making meaningful environmental commitments, including sustainable ingredients and sourcing, packaging, corporate commitments, and consumer transparency.",
	"ingredients": "Parfum/Fragrance, Carthamus Tinctorius (Safflower) Seed Oil, Benzyl Benzoate, Limonene, Hydroxycitronellal, Linalool, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Geraniol, Coumarin, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Leaf Extract, Benzyl Alcohol, Farnesol, Citronellol.",
	"how_to_use": "Suggested Usage:.-Fragrance is intensified by the warmth of your own body. Apply in the creases of your knees and elbows for a longer-lasting, stronger scent.&nbsp;.-After applying, avoid rubbing or dabbing skin. This breaks down the fragrance, causing it to wear off more quickly.&nbsp;.-If you prefer placing fragrance on your wrists, be sure to reapply after frequent hand-washing, as this tends to rinse off the scent.&nbsp;.-Replace fragrance after 12 months. Expired perfumes more than a year old lose the integrity of the original scent...Eau de Toilette or Eau de Parfum?: .The difference lies in the volume of perfume oil. While EDT contains five to nine percent, EDP contains more, usually eight to 14 percent. EDPs, therefore, last longer and smell more intense.",

I have very high standards and when I get a new fragrance, it HAS to meet them in order to stay in my collection!  This was my first time trying a scent from Maison Louis Marie and I was BEYOND impressed by Maison Louis Marie No. 14 Icila Eau de Parfum!!! What I love the most about it is its versatility! It is a fragrance that can be worn day or night, all year round, and for any occasion! Whether I'm heading out to a formal dinner or just running errands, this perfume consistently makes me feel elegant, sophisticated and well put-together. It starts off as fresh and invigorating, giving off a citrusy floral blend from the notes of mandarin leaf, jasmine and ruby pamplemousse. It then begins to warm up into a deep, sexy, dark plum scent with delicate notes of sweet vanilla flower before ultimately drying down into a perfect balance between warm woods and fresh floral blossoms. The longevity of the scent is also impressive, as I can still catch whiffs of it on my skin HOURS after applying it. Not to mention the compliments I receive ALL day long - from 5 minutes after I've applied it to 5 hours!   The packaging of the fragrance is also worth mentioning. The sleek and minimalistic design of the bottle is both chic and underrated, making it the perfect addition to any vanity or perfume collection. A beautiful bottle with no frill labeling, snuggly set in a gorgeous matte off-white box. The sprayer dispenses just the right amount of product, ensuring that you can apply it with precision and control. The Maison Louis Marie brand prides itself on using only the finest natural and sustainable materials/ingredients, and it truly shows in the craftsmanship of this fragrance!"

On me, it smells overwhelmingly of musky vanilla and makes me think of my grandmother. It does seem to have good staying power, which I would be thrilled with if I actually liked the scent. I'm honestly not sure who this is for, but I definitely recommend trying it in-person before buying."

The moment this beautiful fragrance springs from its dazzling glass chambers I smell the freshest flowers of jasmine with a hint of sweetness & peppery playfulness before transpiring into a heavy blanket of patchouli which exhales a strong breath before it softens. As ICILA continues to unfold its story it finally nestles into the warmth of my skin with its signature scent. Still dancing quietly with jasmine, plum and patchouli in its background It wafts forward vanilla and cherry blossoms where they linger intertwined in freshness. The fragrance lingers a few hours, but of course if you want a stronger scent, spray it upon your skin again.   This is what my nose picked up, but I imagine all noses aren‚Äôt the same when it comes to picking up scents. Nonetheless, I love this fragrance and it‚Äôs definitely one I opt for on date nights, before bed and when I want to walk in a room and my presence be known."

From the moment I became a cosmetologist, I have been super intrigued with skincare and finding new product that works for me to be able to share with friends, family, and clients. I was beyond excited to be able to try out Maison Louis Marie No.14 Icila Eau de Parfum. This Parfum bottle is so simple yet elegant which is the first thing that caught my attention. The scents that stuck out to me the most were definitely Jasmine, Mandarine Leaf, and patchouli. Something I really loved was that the box it came in had the scents along with top, mid, and base scents written on it. I love the spritzer on this because it sprays on perfectly unlike others that feel like they‚Äôre not spraying directly where I want it to. My only issue is that after a couple hours I could not smell it anymore and had to reapply.  The scent is great and one thing I truly loved about it was the name ‚ÄúIcila‚Äù which means ‚Äúhere‚Äù. ‚ÄúInspired by the gift of time that should never be taken for granted‚Äù, as stated by the brand.

I love that feeling of picking a new perfume everyday to suit my mood, the occasion, the season, etc. I also love mixing and layering scents to make them very personal to you.  The Maison Louis Marie No. 14- Icila is one of the scents that I can best describe as warm, sophisticated, sweet, yet spicy at the same time. It is such a wonderful mix of notes that balance each other so well. At first spritz I do get a bit of the more floral jasmin notes, that intertwine with some of the sweet bulgarian rose and dark plum, and then finally the dry down is that very spicy vanilla flower with the citrus of the mandarin leaf, but also the sweetness of the sakura blossom. The perfect blend of warm spicy florals.  Even with all those wonderful notes lingering, it is a subtle scent, not overpowering at all and can be worn daily, I would definitely recommend this on a hot summer night in the city enjoying date night or girls night out. It is both elegant and in some ways relaxing as well."

This is an elegant smell that I wouldn‚Äôt recommend for everyday usage. I would save Icila for big moments, such as, engagements, weddings or a first date.I say this because it is a warm scent that is woodsy and floral.  Usually, scents like these aren‚Äôt ideal for your normal day-to-day activities since it is romantic. Any perfume that has a Parisian feel to it is usually romantic.

I'm not even a freshy girl.

This evokes a luxe approachability that has people continually asking me, WHAT are you wearing?!? It is complex, yet somehow nostalgic and identifiable.   Having worked in the beauty industry for as many years as I have, you tend to develop a collection, so I consider myself a true fragrance connoisseur. I am confident in saying that this is the first parfum that upon the first spritz, I am able distinctly identify every single top, mid, and base note.   Upon first spray, the top notes of jasmine and rose burst forth in a delicate yet dramatic fashion, transporting you to a French garden at dusk. The jasmine is decadent and intoxicating, while the rose provides a subtle sweetness that balances the perfume‚Äôs floral heart.     As it settles on the skin, the base notes of warm vanilla and sandalwood emerge, adding depth and warmth to the fragrance.  The vanilla softens the perfume‚Äôs edge, giving it an enveloping sense of comfort and luxury.   For the first time, I have a fragrance that truly lasts. This perfume is unique in its ability to change with my body chemistry and mood throughout the day, pulling out different nuances and scent profiles. Maison Louis Marie No.14 Icila is a timeless perfume that commands attention without being overpowering. I will surely be keeping it in my fragrance rotation for years to come, and it may become my signature scent!  This review was collected as part of a promotion"

The packaging is one of my favorites on the market. So sleek, luxurious and compact. This is a perfume that I highly recommend."

It comes in a classy, clean bottle that is appealing and representative of this clean product.  When I first sprayed this perfume on and smelled it, I was instantly excited!!! There are just so many layers here that I get a different aroma every time I smell my wrist where I sprayed. It has a beautiful, bold floral smell overall, which makes it perfect for spring and summer! It has such a clean, fresh smell to it, like crisp morning air. I definitely picked up on a light, woody aroma as well, comparable to cedar. The combination of scents works so well with my chemistry and it lasts all day! This parfum is now one of my top choices! I recommend to anyone who loves a gorgeous, clean floral scent!"

I especially enjoy wearing beautiful, sophisticated perfumes as I work in my spa room-it is a little self care for me while helping others experience self care. I like perfumes that last a long time and you experience different notes through their wearing. With Icila, I first experience lighter and fresher florals like jasmine and Bulgarian rose. Through wearing, more of the grounded notes start to shine through-woodsy notes and a gentle patchouli. There is a beautiful vanilla note that ties everything together-not a cookie-like vanilla, but something richer and more intriguing. This perfume is perfect for wearing any time of day, and is well rounded for all occasions. My clients have been asking what perfume I am wearing, and I have loved sharing about it with them. This was a great intro to Maison Louis Marie, and I can‚Äôt wait to explore more of their fragrances!"

I have a little gourmand, some musks, some freshies, some fruity summery scents and everything in between. I also have a habit of switching out my daily wear scents depending on the weather and seasonal changes. I typically do a floral scent or something sweet like citrus or fruits in the spring and summer. This scent, however, transcends every concept I have of perfume and scents! It‚Äôs sweet, warm, musky, citrusy and floral all in one!! On me, it starts off heavy mandarin leaf and citrus. It immediately dies down to a musky floral with a rosy touch, then the remaining scent is musky and woody with some florals. I CANNOT stop smelling it!! Even if I‚Äôm just walking past my perfume collection, I stop to smell it! I‚Äôm so honored to have been able to put my nose on this perfume! I‚Äôm a first time smeller and I‚Äôm hooked on this scent and Maison Louis Marie! I love their passion and willingness to be a clean perfumery!

The latest perfume that I have been using is Maison Louis Marie Eau de Parfum No.14 - Icila. This Eau de Parfum comes in a 50 ml /1.7 fl oz beautiful glass bottle.   I like the packaging as it is minimalistic and appeals to the eye. It comes in a very simple yet pretty white box. It definitely stands out and looks beautiful on my vanity.   I like the fragrance of this parfum alot. It is very unique and different from everything I have tried thus far. All its top, mid, and base notes are mentioned on the box. But the notes I like the most are the bulgarian rose, jasmine, patchouli and the sakura blossom. I can definitely smell both floral and woody notes in this parfum. This parfum is long lasting as I can smell it for hours after having put it in. I don't need to reapply it throughout the day.   In my opinion this fragrance is perfect for the summers. It can be worn both at day or night time depending on ones liking.  Also it can be used as an everyday fragrance because its not overpowering or one can save it for a special occasion.   To conclude I really like this perfume and would definitely recommend it to others looking for a fresh, clean, floral scent. I get compliments every time I wear it.

The mental image that I got from the first spritz was like I was being transported to a floral garden somewhere in Europe in the summertime. I really liked the way that it smelled floral and zesty without being overly sweet. It is the perfect scent to wear to work and feel sophisticated. The packaging itself was also lovely, the all clear glass bottle looks clean and cute standing on display on my dresser. The nozzle also disperses the spray in a wide and even mist making it a breeze to use. I would like to recommend this perfume to any woman that is looking for a scent that is able to capture your attention while not being overly potent."

One spray stays for such a long time, and I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs because I sprayed on my skin, but after 30 minutes after spraying, it seemed like the scent got stronger. I also love the meaning behind this perfume, reminds me of how I believe there is a story behind every scent. For this perfume to remind us that we need to enjoy the now since we are already here, we need to take advantage of every second we have, such a beautiful reminder!

The atomizer is exceptional, delivering a fine, even mist with each spray.  Icila opens with a hint of citrus and gradually evolves into a delicate floral bouquet. While Patchouli can often be overpowering in many perfumes, here it‚Äôs barely noticeable. All of the notes blend together to create a complex and unique fragrance.   It reminds me of freshly laundered clothes drying in a warm spring breeze, mingled with blooming flowers. Icila is sophisticated yet playful. It‚Äôs light but impactful, making it perfect for a day at the office but at the same time it‚Äôs also suitable for a date night. Typically, clean and non-toxic fragrances lack staying power, however, I can still smell Icila on my skin and clothes hours after applying it."

			"review_text": "Maison Louis Marie No.14 Icila Eau de Parfum is a feminine warm floral fragrance that screams elegance. I love the sleek minimalistic bottle and packaging. No. 14 Icila opens with a burst of citrus, accompanied by a vanilla base. However, the citrus element is very short lived and gives way to a bouquet of floral notes: rose and jasmine. As the perfume dries down, the vanilla note grows stronger.  It is a warm and creamy scent, while maintaining its sweet floral essence throughout. Strangely enough, the dark plum note isn‚Äôt quite detectable to me when I spray it on my skin, something about my skin chemistry, but it is noticeable when I spray it on clothing. The projection of this perfume is impressive‚Äîothers can easily smell it on me. However, its lasting power leaves something to be desired. I only get four hours of wear.  Maison Louis Marie is a clean fragrance house you will feel good supporting. They are a One Percent for the Planet member and dedicate 1% of their revenue to the National Forest Foundation.  On my skin, this perfume smells better when the sun is out and the temps are warmer. There is something about this scent that makes me think of the Netflix series, Bridgerton, when I wear this. While No. 14 Icila may not have the longest lasting power, it is a beautiful scent that I recommend anyone who enjoys sweet florals, warm vanilla scents to try.    *This review was collected as part of a promotion."

True to its name, Icila uses aromatherapy to put you in moment - the ‚Äúhere‚Äù and now. The two citrusy top notes help reduce stress, while the mid and base notes melt into a warm, sultry floral scent. Usually scents that are in the spicy, woodsy family make me sneeze profusely. This is the first time a brand has perfectly balanced fresh florals with those deeper, warmer scents for a bold, but not overpowering scent. I could go on and on about this fragrance because it‚Äôs expanded my story! Applying three spritzes (one on each side of my neck and 1 rubbed between my inner wrists) of Maison Louis Marie No. 14 - Icila on clean skin leaves me smelling wealthy all day! Unlike other French-based fragrances, Icila does a phenomenal job of embodying the French culture in a bottle. I strongly recommend if you‚Äôre looking for a bold, long-lasting fragrance that balances sultry with sophistication and spicy with fresh. This review was collected as part of a promotion."

The bottle was small but don't get me wrong it's got a kick to it and a little goes a long way. The longevity is also something I love, it lasts pretty much all day on my skin! Whether worn for a special occasion or as an everyday indulgence, it exudes confidence, sophistication, and an undeniable sense of allure.

The jasmine, plum, and rose notes really stand out to me and the vanilla really comes out after it dries down. I really like the scent when I first spray it but I love the scent as it dries down and settles on my skin. It dries down a littler sweeter and woodier. The vanilla really comes to play and the result is stunning. This is such a versatile scent too. It would be perfect all year round but especially in the spring and summer months.

When it comes to florals it can be very overwhelming which is why I find this scent very unique all of the notes blend together so beautifully for a warm, elegant, sultry, fresh clean feminine vibe. Although this reminds me of spring I feel like this is the perfect scent to wear year round or even day to day because of its versatility. It has long lasting wear time and lingers throughout the day I can‚Äôt help but be reminded to live in the moment when wearing Icila."

			"review_text": "Maison Louis Marie‚Äôs No. 14 Icila Eau de Parfum is definitely one of the very unique floral-note perfume that I‚Äôve tried. At the top note, there are some sweet floral-jasmine scent but after that, you can actually notice the woody hint of the perfume. The addition of Bulgarian rose and vanilla flower brings out the uniqueness of the floral note of the perfume.  I am an avid perfume user and I would say that it‚Äôs not easy to find a perfume that can caters to most occasions and seasons, but No. 14 definitely hits the mark. The combination of sweet-woody-warm scent brings out the cheerfulness and elegance of the person wearing it. It is so versatile that I‚Äôm using it from my outings with my girl friends, tagging into office for work to little date nights with my loved ones. Thanks, No. 14 for being my new favorite."

			"review_text": "This fragrance has me conflicted because I enjoy it, but it‚Äôs not normally a scent I would gravitate towards. It definitely smells unisex, but also seems to lean a little more masculine to my nose. The front of the box for this fragrance is sleek and simplistic, and I enjoy seeing the information I‚Äôd want to see for any fragrance. It lists all of the notes formulated inside the fragrance. Due to said notes, it sounds as if it will be more feminine, but it isn‚Äôt. There are quite a few florals and fruitiness but I don‚Äôt pick up on those. To me it smells very crisp and clean, with the patchouli pulling that musky and earthy undertone throughout.  This is more of a fragrance I would want to wear on my clothes and not on my skin. At first I wasn‚Äôt too fond of this scent but it definitely grew on me, and it has this depth to it that feels sexy and confident, but in an inconspicuous sense."

It was afternoon and I was doing dishes when it delivered, I was so excited to open it and spray it on my wrists and inner elbows.. The beautiful smell of this perfume spreads immediately, it's a bit strong but not overpowering.. You can smell the warm bloom of flowers that makes me feel happy, then after few minutes it's gone.. It's like, really? That fast? I was a bit upset coz I think it just lasted for few minutes, then I go back washing the dishes by hand coz I like doing that.. While doing the dishes, wait what is that smell? That smells beautiful, that's smells lovely, I put my wrist closer to my nose to smell it and that's it.. I also smell my elbow and it smell the same with my wrist.. That surprising, my hands and wrists are wet but I can smell the perfume that I thought it already gone.. I decided to try it again and spray it on the back of my ears and neck, I really like it..It's like I'm in the garden of full blooms of fragrant flowers.. It dries down so lovely, I can smell the jasmine and vanilla, soft, a little sweet and innocent.. When my husband got home from work, he asked me what perfume I'm wearing, I smell so good and he said he likes it.. I love getting compliments especially from my husband.. The scent last long on skin but on clothes it last even longer.. And the packaging is really pretty and classy.."

As weather has transitioned into spring, I find myself reaching for this beautiful fragrance - Maison Louie Marie‚Äôs Icila No.14, a blend of juicy dark fruit, crisp grapefruit, floral notes, and a gorgeous vanilla sakura dry down.  Im usually a fruity floral girl, but this has honestly been so captivating and refreshing. Upon the initial spray it‚Äôs citrus and jasmine, and it settles down into a gorgeous plum and patchouli that reads almost savory. If it was a color, it‚Äôd be a deep shade of purple towards magenta - the same color of a freshly bitten plum, surrounded by an herb garden on a dewy spring morning. Loving how this transforms on my skin throughout the day, reminding me to remain present and focused on my here and now.

My first impression was that my expectations had been met! I love the simple and chic packaging and the notes work together beautifully to create an inviting and warm scent. The top notes give more of an earthy feel while the mid and bottom notes allow this fragrance to settle slightly warm and sweet. In theory, this fragrance has all the elements of a luxury scent. However, it would be remiss if I did not mention that, unfortunately, this scent has very little staying power. Initially, it packs a good punch, but it was almost non existent a few short hours later. I should also mention that I LOVE fragrances and have a modest collection, so this experience is a rare occurrence for me. Perhaps if this parfum was layered with the accompanying oil it would last longer. Personally, because this fragrance did not last on me at all, I am not willing to test that theory."

It is a bit different for me. Maybe not quite my taste. I think the best way to apply it is by misting it through the air and walking through it. It definitely has a stronger, longer lasting scent.

			"review_text": "From the brands' incredible history, to the family history of French botany, it's a story that twists and turns from the French Revolution to being exiled to Madagascar and all the incredible Botanical gardens etc of 200 years ago, to its founder Marie du Petit Thouars and her love of the Botanical history of her family. She has created from scent memories of her childhood and family gardens, luxury perfumes candles, and skincare. The husband and wife duo behind Maison Louis Marie are committed to clean beauty, and making amazing perfumes without all the harsh and toxic chemicals -for people or the environment- and they don't test on animals or use any animal byproducts. The company is climate-neutral certified, gives 1% back to the planet on every sale they make, and are part of the National Forrest Foundation. This is a truly clean brand that I am proud to support. Plus how cool is it that their brand mark is an original drawing by Louise Marie of an orchid discovery of his? I love it when Family history is such a big part of a brand. This new intriguing scent is called No. 14- Icila. It's got top notes of jasmine, Mandarin leaf, and ruby Pamplemousse. Followed by mid notes of rose, osmanthus, and dark plum with a base of Vanilla flower, Sakura blossom, and patchouli. The base of vanilla flower is important, it is very noticeable, So if you're not a fan of vanilla, this is probably not a scent for you. The next two scents I can smell the strongest are the Bulgarian rose and dark plum. I must say, Marie has such an incredible nose, and I appreciate her sharing it with the world. This is a perfume that when sprayed on your pulse points, like your wrist and your neck, when you walk into a room people in the back will take notice. I can almost guarantee that they will want to know what you're wearing and where they can get it. Every time I smell No. 14 I get something new from it. The longer you wear it the more you can smell all the layers."

I love that all of the fragrances play homage to Marie‚Äôs family legacy. It is a very minimalistic brand that gives a very timeless, unique and luxurious vibe.   No 14 - Icila was created to make us aware of the here and now. A great reminder of the present (and to stay present!) I am even more aware of stopping and paying attention to the small details in my day and what is going on around me - especially when I catch a glimpse of the Icila perfume I spritzed on my wrist and neck throughout the day. It truly is a fragrance that I‚Äôve never experienced before and I have no other fragrance in my arsenal to compare it to. It‚Äôs almost difficult for me to describe exactly what I smell when I put it on because it‚Äôs so different. It is timeless, invigorating and grounding.

Also, it's fabulous that Maison Louis Marie is dedicated to sustainability, clean ingredients and not testing on animals so I feel great about the brand and what I'm wearing.

I have to be mindful with floral scents as sometimes brands take floral to the extreme and it feels like a garden in my nose in a bad way. This floral No. 14 is the gold standard for how a floral scent should be made. It takes all of the best elements of a garden, including that the scents come on a breeze that you enjoy and aren't overwhelmed by. The notes of Bulgarian rose, vanilla, jasmine, pamplemousse, and sakura blossoms blend together into the perfect spring day. The bottle is also exceptionally aesthetic and sophisticated, it gives me that extra boost that makes me feel elegant and soft when I apply it. The fact that the ingredients are clean, they're made sustainable, and they're cruelty-free are the ethical *chefs kiss* when experiencing this perfume. My husband smelled this on me and immediately loved it on me. Warm, fresh, elegant, and lovely - this is No. 14. You will not be disappointed and it will transport you to a warm sunny day in spring with a bouquet of flowers in hand and a pep in your step."

From the moment I uncapped the bottle, I was enveloped in a delicate floral bouquet that instantly captivated my senses. The blend of jasmine, ruby pamplemousse, dark plum, vanilla flower, and patchouli created a sweet, yet subtly intoxicating aroma that reminded me of the iconic Viktor & Rolf Flowerbomb, but with a less sweet and intimate touch.  What struck me most about No. 14 Icila was its ability to strike the perfect balance between presence and subtlety. With just 1-2 sprays, the fragrance transformed into a delightful skin scent, lingering closely and only detectable by those in my immediate vicinity.   However, when I felt like making a bolder statement, 4-6 sprays created an enchanting scent bubble that extended to arm's length. As the fragrance interacted with my body chemistry, it unfolded in a captivating way, leaving those around me intrigued about the scent I was wearing.  What truly resonated with me about Maison Louis Marie was their commitment to sustainability and minimizing their carbon footprint.

I am what you would consider a well rounded young female, Last month I had the opportunity to experience Maison Louis Marie No. 14 Icila Eau de Parfum for the 1st time. Upon receiving it the thing that caught my eye was the simplicity of the packaging.  The packaging was not elaborate but the smell that was eluding through it was mind blowing. The scent was strong but subtle. There was a floral scent with a hint of vanilla. Instantly my mind went back to my childhood. It reminded me of my granny  who after cooking my favorite vanilla pound cake would go to the flower bed and pick some of her favorite flowers to display on the table beside the yet still warm pound cake. Wow the fragrance that came from the mix of those two scents came together like a vivid sensual vision. Once I applied the Parfum my senses began to tingle and the days of old once again returned with the happy memories of my youth.  Once I began to look over the bottle I noticed that the parfum was vegan. For the last 5 years I have used and consumed only products that were vegan, meaning no meat or animals. To be able to actually have a scent that was not derived from an animal or any of it‚Äôs body parts made it even more special to me. For the company to make such an awesome smelling product without the use of animal by products was an achievement for me. I was already hooked by the scent but to learn that no animals were harmed with the making of this gracious product. I was simply amazed. I grew up on a farm where we often had animals of all kinds so having no animals harmed means a lot to me.  I am so grateful that the makers of this scent thought of making something that was clean and great smelling for consumers like me. The scent does not fade as the day goes on. I have put this on and not had to retouch it all day."

My favorite about this perfume is that it is layerable without being too over powerful. So I like to layer two times. Keep in mind scents are different on everyone and lasts differently depending on what products your using on your body. I found a fresh shower and then spraying afterwards brings it's true form out. Give this a try! I will continue to be wearing this perfume for the rest of spring and throughout summer. Maybe I can sneak it into fall if I don't use it all by then."

Each of its notes blend perfectly together to create an intoxicating scent that is feminine and fresh. The ruby pamplemousse and mandarin leaf top notes provide a bright citrusy opening, while the jasmine gives a soft and floral touch. The mid notes of Bulgarian rose, dark plum, and osmanthus give a fruity depth to the perfume that is simply satisfying. The base notes of patchouli, vanilla flower, and Sakura blossom, give an earthy, warm and sweet finish to this scent. Icila is a perfectly balanced fragrance that can be worn in any season and at any time of day. The staying-power of this perfume is incredible as well. I applied it to my pulse points in the morning and could still smell it on myself the next day. Maison Louis Marie has created the perfect perfume!"

			"review_text": "Maison Louis Marie No.14 - Icila Eau de Parfum has quickly ascended to the top of my fragrance collection, and for good reason. As an experienced cosmetologist with a keen nose for high-quality scents, I am absolutely captivated by this lovely floral masterpiece.  From the moment I first spritzed No.14 - Icila, I was enchanted by its perfectly balanced composition. The top notes of ruby pamplemousse, mandarin leaf, and jasmine provide a vibrant and refreshing introduction. These initial notes are light and uplifting, setting a joyful tone without being overwhelming.  As the fragrance develops, the mid notes of Bulgarian rose, dark plum, and osmanthus reveal themselves, adding depth and sophistication. The Bulgarian rose is particularly notable, lending a timeless elegance that harmonizes beautifully with the sweet richness of dark plum and the delicate charm of osmanthus.  The base notes are where Icila truly shines and demonstrates its staying power. Patchouli, vanilla flower, and sakura blossom create a warm, comforting foundation that lingers pleasantly on the skin. The patchouli adds a subtle earthiness, while the vanilla flower brings a soft sweetness, and the sakura blossom imparts a unique floral twist that ties everything together perfectly.  What I love most about Maison Louis Marie No.14 - Icila is its versatility. It is light enough for daily wear, ensuring I feel fresh and confident all day long, yet it carries enough presence to make a statement for evening occasions. It strikes that perfect balance ‚Äì neither too heavy nor too light.  In my professional opinion, this parfum is a true gem, suitable for any woman who appreciates a refined and exquisite floral scent. Maison Louis Marie has crafted a fragrance that is not only a joy to wear but also an experience to cherish. Highly recommended!"

As soon as I heard that there was a dark plum note I knew that I would love this, since plum is my favorite fragrance note. The strength and sillage were perfect for the fragrance and the notes blended together like a symphony. It's a lovely warm floral and each note stands on its own while also contributing to that beautiful blend. The scent feels very elevated and sophisticated.

But is it anything special? Absolutely not. It just smells like generic perfume to me. I think the base notes are what ruin it for me; it wish they had just kept it a fresh, clean scent instead of adding the warm vanilla and woodsy notes. It doesn‚Äôt last very long either. The smell is very strong when you first put it on, but after about 20 minutes the scent is barely there. I don‚Äôt think the issue is me being noseblind because I haven‚Äôt experienced this with many other perfumes. Overall, this fragrance is fine. It‚Äôs inoffensive and generically pleasing, but really nothing to write home about."

The perfume itself is like a spritz of silk; it is light, gentle and lays on the skin like veil. it is not oily, nor is it drying to the skin. It leaves no sheen, and blends effortlessly with a mild smelling lotion. The No.14 Icila Eau de Parfum lasted for more than eight hours and into midnight without the need for reapplication; only one spritz delivered perfect distribution and intensity of perfume.   My impression of the No.14 Icila Eau de Parfum is that it is one of the most unique, long-lasting and imaginative perfumes I have ever tried. I highly recommend the No.14 Icila Eau de Parfum for all occasions and for perfume connoisseurs seeking a new, unique perfume to add to their collection."

The scent is charming and inviting.  It has a nice elevated sophistication that stands out from other fragrances that I have experienced.  It has a variety of botanical scents.  The blend is somewhat complex, but I find it works beautifully together, almost like in harmony.    To describe it, the scent feels like I've stepped into a blooming garden of botanicals.  Each botanical scent is equally strong in presence.  The scent performs a beautiful dance to my sense of smell.  It makes me pause and indulge in its presence.    It has a warm and inviting feeling.  I think the floral vanilla creates that balance of invite.  It would say this is a perfect fall and winter fragrance that sends forth coziness and warmness.    I find each layer of the top, mid, and base notes creates a splendor of admiration and curiosity.  Complex in some way because of all the different botanicals involved such as patchouli, rose, jasmine, to name a few, but the complexities truly have impressed me.    I am enjoying the complexities and the charm of this fragrance.  A little spritz can go a long way.  The scent lasts for hours.    The packaging is simply gorgeous.  I love an aesthetic glass bottle. The pump spray dispenses a nice fine mist.    Overall, a beautiful product.  If you are trying this for the first time,  I think you'll be pleasantly surprised."

She had a unique love of the French perfumers, it is a love she passed on to me and now, at age forty-five I have my collection of bottles to display.  There is something to be said for any scent. A reason why you may love it or dislike it. It invokes something from within you. Unlocking little hidden jewels of yourself. Bringing them to life within that moment. No.14 Icila by Maison Louis Marie is a stunning compilation of scents that remind us to live in the here but to also hold onto those memories. With notes that flash to life brightly with the first spritz and then mellow to a beautiful charming enveloping scent of warmth.  For me the scent is long wearing, up to five hours without reapplication. The notes I capture most frequently are ruby Pamplemousse, vanilla, and hints of those sultry, sexy deep woods. The vanilla is not a sweet type of vanilla as one might find in a gourmand perfume but rather a deeply seductive vanilla. If one dislikes vanilla, however, I would avoid this scent.  I love this scent. I reach for it often and I imagine myself, sitting outside of a beautiful little French cafe as spring has started. I have my cup of tea and a book. The weather is beautiful. Not too hot, not too cold. A bit of a breeze carries the scent of blooming flowers from a nearby park on its travels. People are walking by. Birds are singing. There is a fountain nearby and I can hear the water as it flows gently. The sky is a perfect shade of blue. It is the perfect day and it is all accompanied by this warm and luxurious scent. And I am indeed living in the now in that day because there is no phone, no rush it is pure bliss. I am happy. It is my happy place.   This is an extraordinary scent suited for anyone and is planet-friendly.   Review collected as part of a gifted collaboration with the brand."

			"review_text": "From the first wear, Maison Louis Marie No. 14 moved into the top spot in my fragrance collection. Allow me to start by saying, I‚Äôm no fragrance expert, I just know what I like. One of my most treasured fragrances is Chanel Mademoiselle but it is very sophisticated and in my opinion most  suitable for evening and special occasions.  No. 14 - Icila has many of the same notes such as jasmine and patchouli but is softer bed with ruby pamplemouse and vanilla. The best way I can describe it is that it‚Äôs sophisticated yet approachable.   The packaging is beautifully simplistic and the glass bottle looks right at home amongst my others. The fragrance lasts all day on my skin and I especially enjoy when I return to the area of my home where I applied it and can still smell it hours later.   This is my first experience with this brand and certainly will not be my last. This is a scent for all seasons and I look forward to enjoying it."

It features nice details such as the shape of the bottle and lid as well as the modern looking label on the bottle.  This fragrance has some good lasting power.  I can spray on a couple of times in the morning and still smell this hours into my work day.  I like this aspect as it gives me self-confidence that I will smell nice even at the end of my work day.    The scent notes here are warm floral notes.  The rose and jasmine pair well with the vanilla flower notes.  Some of the scent description leads me to think this might be a fruity floral, but it is not.  This is something that I would wear every day to the office or out and about on the weekends."

I have always loved having different scents for different occasions and seasons, and I have just recently run out of my go-to everyday scent for warmer weather. In my hunt for a new one, the Maison Louis Marie No.14 Iclia Eau de Parfum caught my eye and has not disappointed. I always look for scents that are warmer with notes of wood and vanilla while still being feminine and this scent embodies that while also adding florals in a way that isn‚Äôt too overpowering. Aside from loving the scent itself, I also look for a scent that is going to last throughout the day. As this has become my everyday scent, I spray it on my wrists and neck and have found myself smelling it at different points of the day which I love. I‚Äôve found that sometimes you become nose blind to scents on yourself and this parfum doesn‚Äôt do that which ensures me of its longevity and quality. Most importantly, I have gotten so many compliments while wearing this scent, and now that it‚Äôs out I can‚Äôt wait to recommend it to my friends and colleagues! Scent is one of the hardest and most personal things to buy for yourself and others so I of course recommend you go in-store and smell it to ensure it aligns with your taste, but for me I will be repurchasing this and keeping it as a staple in my collection for the foreseeable future. I am very impressed!"

I have #13 and it's one of my favorite scents and was so excited to try #14 because I just love everything the brand is about! A brand that never uses ingredients harmful for the environment or to the body, refrains from animal testing and abstains from using animal derived ingredients.   No.14 Icila is a symphony of elegance and allure. I get so many compliments when I wear it. My 13 year old daughter is often stealing it from me proving this scent can be worn by anyone!  Inspired by the French word 'ici,' meaning 'here,' this enchanting scent serves as a gentle reminder to cherish every fleeting second. I love the meaning behind this scent. I try and live every day in the moment and wearing this scent reminds me to do that! With its captivating blend of notes, including mandarin leaf, jasmine, Bulgarian rose, patchouli and vanilla flower it's the perfect combination blended seamlessly.   To enhance its lasting power, I apply 1-2 sprays at pulse points like my wrists and neck. I love it in my hair too! If you're in search of a signature scent that's as unique as you are, look no further than No. 14 Icila. It's a must-have addition to any fragrance collection. Trust me, you won't be disappointed!

I knew from the description of the scent that it was something that intrigued me and peaked my curiosity, but this intoxicating blend of warm florals has completely stolen my heart! Makes me feel like I'm in a vibrant garden in springtime in France, whisking me away on a bed of floral blossoms! The fragrance is elegantly packaged in a very simplistic box and the bottle has a classic, sophisticated streamlined design that looks stunning atop my vanity. I have worn this many times in the past couple of weeks both alone and layered with other fragrances and have received many compliments along the way. This scent is long lasting, but not overpowering, which I totally appreciate as some fragrances can be just a bit too much. Absolutely cart worthy for any fragrance lover looking for a classy new floral blend to try!"

Upon the initial application, there's a strong citrus scent that is both refreshing and invigorating. However, this citrus burst quickly dissipates, giving way to a delicate blend of light vanilla and floral notes.  What I appreciate most about this perfume is its subtlety. It manages to leave a noticeable but not overpowering fragrance, making it suitable for everyday wear as well as special occasions. Additionally, the perfume is long-lasting, allowing the soft, elegant scent to linger throughout the day without the need for frequent reapplications.  Overall, Maison Louis No. 14 Icila Eau de Parfum is a beautifully balanced fragrance that combines the freshness of citrus with the warmth of vanilla and floral undertones. It's a perfect choice for anyone seeking a long-lasting, sophisticated scent that isn't overwhelming."

I have been into niche, designer, and clean fragrances for over 4 years now and I must say that No. 14 Icila has the strongest presence of the dark plum.  Key Notes include Jasmine, Bulgarian Rose, and Vanilla Flower but I get lots of plum, Sakura blossom, and mandarin leaf too, especially upon the initial application.  The first sprays are super powerful and complex, combining several fragrance notes that slowly become stronger on each own. The opening is sweet, juicy, and fruity but with a delicate touch of vanilla and osmanthus.  The longevity is quite impressive considering it‚Äôs a clean fragrance. It lasts approximately 4 hours on my skin and longer on my clothes. After drying down, the scent is not as sweet as in the beginning and becomes this fresh, clean close to the skin scent. I think it‚Äôs more suitable for early spring and autumn/winter.  The atomizer is well designed. It sprays a fantastic fine mist that covers more skin and doesn‚Äôt squirt all over the place. And I love the minimalist, modern bottle design that comes in a paper box. It‚Äôs perfect for gifting."

The vanilla scent isn't very sweet - the fragrance overall is a fresh floral.   This fragrance is very personal. One would have to sit right next to you or give you a hug to really smell it.

My first impression of the perfume wasn't the best. To me the patchouli and rose came in very strong and those are two notes that I typically do not gravitate towards. At first it smelled a little too mature for my personal taste. Once it dried down a little bit, I really started to enjoy and appreciate the scent. The vanilla and plum enveloped the rose and it complimented it so beautifully. After hours of wear it smelled more like a musky vanilla which is one of my favorite scent profiles, so I really liked that. The sillage is pretty strong in my experience and it was pretty long lasting. I also love the presentation of the packaging too."

Overall it gives a fresh, clean ambiance perfect for daytime. I feel you can get away with using more of this perfume on all the pulse points rather than some stronger fragrances where a tiny spritz will do.  The only downside is the short longevity. It only lasts a couple hours on me. This may not necessarily be a bad thing for some people if they like to transition fragrances from day to night but I prefer a longer staying power.  Overall, it is a beautiful fragrance. The packaging reflects the understated, simplistic, yet elegant nature of the smell. It is not overwhelming and can only be smelled in close distances.

No. 14 is definitely very innovative for Maison - it boasts this wonderful floral air that is balanced by their signature base scent. This citrusy floral scent transports me to the outdoors while maintains a deeper base that would let me transition this scent from day to night as it develops on my skin.  I have worn this for about a week and have worn it out in public - I gathered about 3 people asking what scent I was wearing. I will say it is not as long lasting as their other scents, but it still does linger when you spray on your clothes.

As the fragrance develops, the beautiful floral heart notes of jasmine, lily of the valley, and white tea emerge. These provide a delicate, feminine touch that's not overpowering at all. And the base of amber, patchouli, and vetiver lend a wonderful warm, earthy foundation that grounds the scent.  What I really love about Icila is its versatility. It works beautifully for both daytime and evening wear. In the daytime, the fresh, invigorating top notes shine, while at night the deeper, more sensual base notes come through more prominently.  However, my only issue was with its longevity - I felt like I could only get 3-4 hours of wear time. And the sillage (how much the fragrance projects) is a but too light for my taste.  If you're a fan of natural, complex fragrances with a beautiful floral heart, I highly recommend trying Maison Louis Marie No. 14 Icila. It's a true work of olfactory art."

From the stunning packaging to the beautiful atomizer, this fragrance is aesthetically pleasing. At first, I wasn‚Äôt too sure on the opening due to the strong florals. I would describe it as walking through a flower field. However, once it settled down, it was intoxicating! I love how the vanilla note came out. As I wore this fragrance throughout the day, I couldn‚Äôt stop sniffing my wrist. The only thing is that I wish it lasted a bit longer on my skin. I was able to get maybe 4-5 hours of wear before it became a skin scent on me.  * This review was collected as part of a promotion"

This perfume opens with the warm embrace of jasmine, followed by the rich aroma of Bulgarian rose, and settles into a sweet, lingering vanilla flower. It's both timeless and contemporary, perfect for any occasion from casual brunches to formal events. The scent isn't overpowering but has a noticeable, inviting presence that draws compliments.  One of its best features is its longevity; it lasts all day, ensuring you smell delightful from morning to evening.

I love that the name Icilia is used to name this. From the packaging to opening the box of this parfum it's presentation is simple yet beautiful and luxe. Diving into the scent itself, I'd describe it as taking a walk through a field of mixed flowers. The ruby pamplemousse note is one I'd never encountered but lovely, and I do get the jasmine and Bulgarian rose for sure. For me the sakura blossom resonates towards the dry down and I do pick up on a hint of vanilla and patchouli. These are all blended beautifully and this is such a light, fresh, not at all overbearing scent and I couldn't be any more pleased."

This fragrance opens like a fruity cocktail: there‚Äôs sweetness, a ripe juiciness, a twist of citrus peel. As it settles, the floral notes (rose, vanilla flower, cherry blossom) bloom and heighten the sweetness. It smells familiar yet unexpected.   I enjoy this fragrance, but I wouldn‚Äôt call it a favorite. The strong florals sometimes remind me more of high-end air freshener than perfume. It doesn‚Äôt last as long as I‚Äôd like, either. If I spray it on in the morning, it‚Äôs gone by lunch, and it doesn‚Äôt linger on my clothes. I do love the atomizer, though. It sprays such a beautiful fine mist that I find myself putting on more perfume than I ordinarily would just to feel the soft cloud of it on my skin."

I was disappointed that the eau de parfum didn't linger long on the skin long.  As the day carried on I found myself searching for the scent on my skin.  I appreciated the blend of the citrus and warm notes in the fragrance as they balance each other out nicely. The citrus notes of mandarin leaf keep the warmth and richness of patchouli from being over bearing and too powerful as patchouli can be on its own.  I really enjoyed this fragrance and think it would be a welcomed addition to fragrance lovers who are looking for something that won't meet those around you before you do.  It's slightly sweet, warm and inviting scent is sure to please those who are looking for a mild and less intense parfum. I did receive this product in exchange for my review."

It has a roller ball so you get just the right amount without waisting a single drop allowing you to be in complete control of exactly where and how much each and every time. The simplicity of the design is stunning and sleek with a simple glass bottle and ivory and black label.  At first connection with my skin I right away got the rich Bulgarian rose notes that smelled almost singular. Within nano seconds the fragrance oil began to bring in its many layers, the warm indulgent vanilla and bergamot let their presence be known. As the day goes on it changes every time I smell it. It‚Äôs so much fun to see how it develops.  It‚Äôs sophisticated but easy and makes me feel feminine but in a strong way. As time goes on it builds and changes to adapt to your chemistry. It makes me want to jump on the next flight to Paris. I will keep No 14 in my collection permanently."

Most of my favorite perfumes are French and when I learned that this brand is from France I knew right away that I will be in love with it. So let's get to what I like and what I don't like. Starting with the positive, the second I spray this perfume on me it takes me somewhere else for a moment, I get every single one of those top notes, The jasmine and Mandarin leaf remind me of my childhood, I grew up surrounded by mandarin trees. And then, when I come back from my quick back in time travel I smell that Dark plum and Bulgarian rose and it makes me feel good, it makes me feel elegant. Love it ! Once it settles down you get that beautiful Vanilla, not the sweet chemical kind, this vanilla balances perfectly this perfume. Now, let's discuss the downside‚Äîit doesn't last as long as I'd like. After a few hours, it disappears from my skin but it's a cute little bottle, it fits perfectly in my purse, I carry it around and I spray it again when needed. I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a unique perfume that will awaken your senses and make you feel amazing."

I sometimes experience a headache with the flower aspects of perfume if it is too much but with the No.14 Icila it has the perfect amount of floral to it without being bothersome. The No. 14 Icila perfume lasts all day on my skin. My husband even complimented me on smelling good when I wear this perfume and he is very sensitive to fragrance.  He never compliments my perfumes and I have some good one's.So that is a huge plus in my opinion because who doesn't want to be told by their signfcant other that they smell good!

Working in the beauty industry also I feel that it's important to not just look good but have a overall clean and put together appearance including smelling good. I personally don't typically like floral or real sweet fragrances and tend to lean towards unisex or even men's colognes, more woodsy, earthy, spicy fragrances because one of my favorite notes is patchouli. I was unsure what kind of scent I'd be experiencing here with the Maison Louis Marie No. 14 Icila even after hearing what notes it held which included one that really intrigued me.. Dark Plum.. This is one of the key notes and note one I've really ever remembered seeing in any other fragrance, jasmine and vanilla flower are the two other key notes so I was expecting a more floral scent and while it does have a light floral feel to it it's not your typical overwhelming floral at all. This scent is honestly beautifully made and blended, it's soft and clean, yet stands out but doesn't scream at you. It reminded me a bit of Versace Bright Crystal and it definitely has a rich luxury fragrant feel, you can absolutely tell its made with hands that really love perfumery and nature. It's a scent that could be worn as easily in the day as it could in the night and I feel like it's buildable depending on the amount you wear and could absolutely be layered with another fragrance to switch it up easily. I love that it's a clean fragrance with 1% for the planet, you can really see the brand cares about the environment especially because you can see they truly derive what they need to make their fragrances from the environment and not just in a lab. I'm dying to delve into more of Maison Louis Marie's fragrances as this is my first out of the collection but I guarantee it won't be the last."

It smells like a luxury scent and it is quite feminine. It will be the perfect scent for a dinner night. The citrus note addition is thoughtful, because after you spray and the scent sets down you can smell a hint of it to cool it down. The only drawback I found is that the smell is not long lasting at all. It stays on for two hours maximum and disappears after that. It does not stay on cloths although for a fragrance with such notes I would expect it to last long."

Although it is a floral scent, I pick up on the sweetness that comes through with the vanilla. The fragrance lasts on me for hours and I don‚Äôt find myself having to reapply often. I also like the minimalist packaging, looks so luxurious."

I have recently started dabbling into perfumes and I am so glad I got to try this Maison Louis Marie No. 14 Icila Eau de Parfum. It was love at first spritz for me. Actually, love at first sight to be more exact. The packaging is so clean and elegant, very timeless and beautiful. I also love that they have the notes listed on the outer packaging so if you ever want to glance through, you have easy access. The perfume itself is a beautiful complex floral scent that transcends me into the glamor and mystery world. It is not very strong but still lasts for hours. I get plenty of compliments everytime i try. It can be worn during the day or evening outs but I am planning to savor it and use it on special occasions and date nights. Overall, it is an absolute win for me and I totally recommend it for anyone who likes long lasting warm floral scents."

			"review_text": "As a beauty expert, I love skincare and makeup but the finisher would be perfume. Finding the perfect scent to go with your own pheromones can be challenging at times because so many smell good but may not last long or smell different once on the skin. I had the opportunity to try No.14 Icila Eau de Parfum by Maison Louis Marie recently and here are my thoughts:   This is one beautiful multi scented perfume and I say multi because you can truly smell the different notes. When you first spray the Icila, it's a surge of ruby pamplemousse followed by mandarin. Then mid dry you get hints of rose and plum. But, in my opinion, the best part is the ending dry down where you smell the vanilla flower and Sakura blossom. This perfume also has patchouli in it which I don't care for and oddly enough, it doesn't bother me at all when blended with these other gorgeous notes. It's a very intoxicating fragrance that will turn heads and get you many compliments. This is a perfect everyday fragrance and it last all day as well. If you want to turn heads and smell like you live in the most beautiful, exotic garden around, then you need this gorgeous fragrance."

My first impression is the bottle is truly exquisite. Such a simple classic touch. The atomizer delivered such a light spritz that seemed to distribute evenly. I feel almost emotional each time I wear this scent. I‚Äôve been wearing this daily and have even found myself applying right before slipping into bed.   This bright warm floral is so intoxicating, I instantly get hit with a wall of jasmine. It‚Äôs so uplifting. I‚Äôm usually not a fan of Rose but for some reason, when it‚Äôs Bulgarian Rose I don‚Äôt get any ‚Äúsoapy‚Äù notes.   The glow of sultry woods really makes the vanilla vibe stand out. It‚Äôs not a sweet vanilla, it‚Äôs perfectly warm. I like to say ‚Äúadult vanilla‚Äù lol. I can see myself not only using this fragrance until it‚Äôs gone, but purchasing for myself. I love waking up from a great nights sleep to this scent on my sheets! It‚Äôs an instant pick me up! The dry down on my skin lasts for hours which is another HUGE bonus! This will definitely be my signature scent exclusively lol.   I love clean ingredients! Maison Louis Marie uses sustainable ingredients, a mission statement that I agree with and I do truly believe that we are not guaranteed anything in life and this scent is a reminder that life is beautiful, just like this scent!   Definitely recommend, even for those who are not usually drawn to florals"

The scent smells a lot like going into a flower shop. Typically, when I buy floral scents, I go for more rosey scents. They usually smell more feminine to me. However, this is a good scent for everyday wear. I started wearing this to work, and I received tons of compliments when wearing this product. As for the packaging, the perfume comes in a very pretty glass bottle. I am actually afraid to mishandle it. Additionally, the scent is very long lasting and not overpowering. I could smell the scent on me for hours while I was at work. The intensity of the scent is about a medium. It is not too weak and not too strong. I put on 4 sprays on the chest for reference. I highly recommend this perfume to anyone who likes floral scents and it is perfect for everyday wear."

From first look of packaging -it looks very elegant and classy with minimal design. Love that the notes are clearly printed on the top of the box  which I found really useful. Inside it has cutout setting where bottle is kept. It looks beautiful as you open . However in my case it was not the case. Upon opening the packaging I found  the lid was open, lying in a corner and bottle was under the cutout, so not a pleasant experience for me. So definitely brand need to do more work to secure the bottle so that it does not slip under the cutout packaging and  it reaches the customer as the brand planned  it and customers get to enjoys the beauty of packaging. The bottle design is also simple, classic and looks elegant.   This perfume smells gorgeous. I love the scent. Here are notes of perfume  Top - Ruby Pamplemousse, Mandarin Leaf, Jasmine  Mid - Bulgarian Rose, Dark Plum, Osmanthus  Base - Patchouli, Vanilla Flower, Sakura Blossom.  I can definitely smell roses in it. The notes are blended beautifully.  It smell so fresh and seductive. It is not a strong scent but a light one which diminishes with times. When I wore it, everyone around me liked the fragrance and I did get some compliments too.   For me it only last upto 4 hours and I tried few times as more or less the timing are same. After 3-4 hours it faded away quickly and that is the only down side for me. But overall I am very happy with this perfume as what matters more for me is the fragrance and it loved it and people around me also enjoyed it. It is a great find for me."

I can also catch some wafts of subtle vanilla and what smells like plum emanating from my skin. This fragrance is heavily floral, but in such a way that it somehow almost leans to a FRESH white floral on me. I get a good 10+ hours of this perfume on my skin in terms of longevity, and the sillage I would say is moderate. A lady quite literally stopped me dead in my tracks in the middle of the grocery store the other day to ask me what I was wearing, and I just so happened to have the bottle with me.

The dark plum note really shines, adding a unique touch that I love. It's versatile enough for any occasion, and even as a heavy sprayer, I find it never overwhelms.  The patchouli is present but not overpowering, which is great. This perfume smells fantastic straight from the bottle, but once you spray it on, it transforms into an even more delightful scent. It‚Äôs one of those fragrances that evolves beautifully on your skin throughout the day.  Longevity is another plus‚Äîthis perfume lasts all day. Even as it wears down, the hint of vanilla becomes noticeable, but it's a sophisticated, not-too-sweet vanilla.   I can't praise this perfume enough. It‚Äôs definitely a 5 out of 5 stars for me!"

This is such a delicate and airy perfume that perfectly captures the essence of being here in the moment. It‚Äôs that fragile instant that is here now and gone in a split second. Icila is a beautiful airy sweet floral scent. It has so much going on, but it is very well blended and comes out smooth and light. The scent is effervescent where you get that airy, light quality, but without sharp fizziness. The moment I spray it, I almost feel like it has some aquatic quality, but not exactly salty sea water. Icila reminds me of breeze blowing over plain water and giving that very fresh note. The next thing that hits me is a delicate sweetness mixed with flowers. I love the note of ruby pamplemousse and the juiciness it gives. I also smell plum and vanilla. I can‚Äôt specifically name the flowers I smell, but it‚Äôs a mix of white and pink flowers, almost more like just a touch of petals dipped in vanilla (not a rich floral note). This is a perfect inoffensive fragrance for spring and summer. I can see myself wearing it both on the cooler and hotter days. Icila is such a beautiful blend of scents and it is so addicting. Whenever I wear it, I cannot stop smelling myself. I am quite picky with perfumes, and especially when it comes to floral notes, but this one was love at first sniff. It is such a ‚Äúme‚Äù scent and it quickly became one of my top perfumes."

The smell is very floral with some sweet notes of vanilla in there but it's not overly sweet and the notes all play very well together. I can't use alot of perfumes because they either make me itch or the chemical smells they have to them completely overpower what little fragrance notes they have and give me a major migraine. I am also a major floral girl so this was right up my alley. I thought it was neat also that you can actually layer the different scents on their line since I was always told as a kid you never do that with fragrances so I look forward to trying it out myself. Hands down would absolutely buy more from this line."

With notes of Jasmine, Bulgarian Rose and Vanilla Flower, it smells absolutely amazing and makes me feel sexy and unstoppable - perfect for a date night, or an important occasion! The scent of Jasmine and Rose bring some freshness to the sweet vanilla and gives it a unique complexity, differentiating it from other more banal smells, and is not intoxicatingly sweet.  This is definitively a scent that turns heads and I have received many compliments when using it, from men and women.  It lasts a few hours, but not as long as other perfumes I have, which is the only downside.  I love the minimalist and luxury packaging, with some old-money vibes, and the fact that the brand uses environment-friendly ingredients and avoids animal testing.   **This review was collected as part of a promotion."

At first, the scent is very subtle, but throughout the day it blends with your skin and creates a wonderful blend. None of the notes overpower one another, which is incredibly hard to do.

Maison Louis Marie No.14 Icila Eau de Parfum has a very pretty and soft scent, it is not overwhelming and feels light and delicate. I imagine wearing this to something during the day that is a dressy, classy event. The vanilla scent is subtle and not strong like you would imagine from a perfume that has vanilla. The more I wear it the more it grows on me. Most people that have smelled it on me like it however my husband did not care for it, so I think it just depends on what scents a person really likes. I think of walking through roses when I smell it and I‚Äôm assuming it because of the bulgarian rose. The bottle is elegant yet simple and has classy written all over it. The box tells you all the scents which I really love  because it‚Äôs nice to see the names of what I‚Äôm smelling. I feel like this perfume perfect for anyone that likes soft scents."

This smell so pretty and lovely. Like a picnic date on a nice spring day and I am here for it. Not to mention the bottle it self is just beautiful.  I think my one caveat with this is that it isn‚Äôt the most long lasting. After about 3 hours it is still apparent on my skin IF I really smell the areas where I applied, but it is very faint. I think this would be a good layer scent with other rose/floral scented fragrances. Maybe even a sweet fragrance due to the vanilla flower note.  Even with the note of the longevity I am extremely thankful for have this in my collection and definitely think it is worth picking up."

If you're a fan of florals, I highly recommend the No. 14 Icila Perfume Oil, which is also super long-lasting. The texture is amazing - a velvety oil that feels very pleasant on the skin.

For me a fragrance is very personal and sets the mood for the day and I really take a moment to intentionally put on fragrance. This fragrance starts out with the floral scent with Jasmine as the most noticeable note. This scent keeps on changing throughout the day and the notes keep on developing. The beautiful dark plum and Bulgarian rose add a bit of sweetness and fruitiness to this scent. I love how it eventually blends with the warmth, smoothness, and silkiness of the vanilla flower. This scent is not too overpowering. The notes are nicely balanced and not overly sweet. It is very elegant, sophisticated, and invigorating. I love how long-lasting it is and that I can wear it day or night. Overall, a fresh and warm floral scent that is not too overpowering and perfect for summer!"

In my 40's now but this deep-rooted passion has been something I could find solace in throughout all these years. I have over 80 scents in my collection and I'm always on the hunt for more. Be it niche, designer or indie, I must sniff them all.    As a fan of the house of Maison Louis Marie, I was super excited to try their newest releases, N¬∞14 Icila Eau de Parfum. Sleek box, aesthetic clear glass bottle (in line with MLM's minimalistic packaging) and a super fine mister are all part of the fragrance experience and was I in for a treat?   The way we as individuals perceive fragrances will vary from one person to the next, therefore my experience may not mirror yours.   Icila opens with a fresh burst of grapefruit juice and green lushness of crushed citrus leaves. It awakens my senses with this slight bitterness that quickly leads me to the heart of dark, dark plum and Bulgarian Rose. She's dark, mysterious, dare I say vintage? The rose doesn't turn jammy or jam-like despite the presence of plum. The base notes of vanilla flower and Sakura simply don't come through for me - might just be my body chemistry, however the presence of patchouli is undeniable and will sure turn heads.    Icila has a wild beast projection for the first 3 hours and afterwards she slowly fades into the background becoming a skin-scent. I think this can be remedied by spraying on clothes (big plus it's a clear liquid so won't stain fabric) or hair. Could be layered with an oil-based moisturizer also for better longevity.    N¬∞14 took me by surprise: it's not a scent I anticipated from MLM.  Wouldn't consider it a safe blind purchase however, it's certainly more suited for more mature audiences - in my humble opinion. It's not your modern fruitchouli salad - definitely a unique, easily identifiable scent for special occasions."

I never rub or even blot my fragrance and let it just dry down into my skin to get the true scent.  The funny thing is; my boyfriend and walked in unexpectedly on his lunch break from work a few minutes later, not even knowing I had sprayed this, and he exclaimed ‚Äòoh wow! That smells so good!‚Äô.  Needless to say this will be on heavy rotation in my collection.

I was genuinely impressed with this perfume because of its very high quality while also being a clean, natural, vegan beauty fragrance made without any harmful chemicals/ingredients that is detrimentally harmful to the body! My first impression of the Maison Louis Marie No. 14 Icila Eau de Parfum is a fresh, modern, purely elegant, sophisticated, beautiful fresh floral fragrance that is truly intoxicating! This perfume has warm beautiful floral notes of Jasmine, Bulgarian Rose, Vanilla Flower. There are some top notes of ruby pamplemousse and Mandarin leaf. It also smelled like a fresh slight musk to it sort of like a hint of light baby powder. If you love a perfume that is mostly all floral notes you will love this perfume!  The perfume is not super strong because it is a natural based perfume not made with strong chemicals or often toxic ingredients but it did last most of the day but then the fragrance gently faded. I still prefer a more natural based perfume then a perfume made with toxic harsh ingredients!  The packaging and perfume bottle was stunningly sleek, elegant, beautiful but simple! The Maison Louis Marie No. 14 Icila Eau de Parfum came in a beautiful thin box and the perfume bottle is gorgeous!  I love this perfume because it smells like a top notch very high end designer perfume or from a high end fragrance boutique while being a perfume that is better for your health!

When you first spray this, your first thought is probably Oh no, this smells old lady because it comes off as a strong floral scent. It is  STRONG first spritz. Just GIVE IT A CHANCE TO DRY DOWN. Once it does, it is not super strong anymore. It is pretty light and comes off as a light floral with a subtle sweetness. The rose note is the most apparent, and the mandarin leaf and sakura blossom second. the scent tones down almost 80% to a nice light floral. It's very classy but fresh. If I could imagine this scent, its very cocktail party or picnic in the park in a cotton dress. One thing I don't like too much is how after application, about an hour later I feel like I can not smell it anymore, and have to keep reappling it. My husband says its very very light. So longevity I dont think is the best, but with a heavy floral perfume that's probably for the best because strong floral can be overpowering and old lady smelling.This review was collected as part of a promotion."

			"review_text": "My initial impression of Maison Louis Marie No. 14 is that it smells really feminine. Its blend of rose and jasmine provides a rather strong floral basis, along with a touch of powdery sweetness from vanilla and dark plum. The fragrance has a quite potent floral opening, which I think some people with sensitive noses may find somewhat overpowering (with can cause headache possibly). To be honest, when I first smell the scent, I felt slightly overwhelmed by the power of jasmine note. However, compared the scent's opening, the dry down was a game-changer that makes me enjoy the perfume. The floral notes gradually subsided, allowing the richness of the plum and vanilla to emerge and meld harmoniously. At this phase, the scent was more floral and fruity with a faint citrus powdery undertone. It‚Äôs fresh, it‚Äôs sweet, it‚Äôs classy and can be used all year round. I think it‚Äôs a great daily scent. The packaging is simple and minimalistic, which is what I like about Maison Louis Marie overall. I find it very convenient that all the scent notes are printed on the box, which  helps customers understand what to expect from the scent before they try it. On the other hand, I would like to see a longer lifespan as a computer. In my case it lasted for almost 2-3 hours and then disappeared. Must be reapplied throughout the day.

			"review_text": "Icila by Maison Louis Marie is an elevated, seductive fragrance. The top notes of Jasmine, ruby pamplemousse, and mandarin leaf provides a lush, floral opening to the scent. This leads to the hearty middle notes of Bulgarian rose, dark plum, and osmanthus, which provide depth and body. The alluring base of patchouli, vanilla flower, and Sakura blossom leaves a dazzling scent trail that follows for hours. Typically, clean fragrances can fade quite fast on my skin, but Icila has phenomenal lasting power and silage. The fragrance itself is incredibly nostalgic for me, it reminds me of childhood afternoons spending time with my French family members outside in their garden. Maison Louis Marie is a phenomenal fragrance house and this scent is an excellent addition for their lineup; Icila is a sweeter floral scent that still matches up with their ethos and style. Icila is a dynamic, sparkling, effervescent fragrance that I am so grateful to have in my collection!"

			"review_text": "As someone who enjoys floral and vanilla fragrances, Maison Louise Marie's Icila No. 14 Eau De Parfum is a favourite of mine. I wear it daily during my long ER shifts, and it lasts the entire 8+ hours. Its top notes include ruby pamplemouse, jasmine, and mandarin, followed by middle notes of Bulgarian rose and dark plum, settling into warm vanilla, patchouli, and sakura blossom. It creates a cosy and comforting feeling, perfect for summer when paired with a vanilla body cream. I layer it with Bath and Body Works' Simply Unwind sandalwood and vanilla scent, applying it to my wrists, elbows, and neck. I've also paired it with MLM No. 4 Bois de Balincourt and received many compliments. Overall, it's become an essential part of my daily routine. This review was collected as part of a promotion."

			"review_text": "I will admit that I am one of those types of people who can never leave the house without brows, lashes, earrings and a spritz of something. Fragrance is such an important accessory and can set the mood for the day. As an esthetician who has been practicing for over a decade, I am very mindful of what kind of fragrances that I wear when in the treatment room, and my go tos are usually fresh, subtle and rooted in nature.   Maison Louis Marie's No.14 Icila Eau de Parfum immediately starts out as a fresh and effervescent scent that reminds me of a warm and sunny spring day. I love the initial presentation of this fragrance which contains the top notes of ruby pamplemousse (grapefruit), and mandarin leaf to invoke a touch of playfulness, while jasmine creates a bit of floral to help round out the fragrance.   The presence of Bulgarian rose, dark plum and osmanthus add a surprising depth to this fragrance by lending a woodsy aroma. As this fragrance wears, the vanilla flower, sakura blossom and patchouli grounds this fragrance to create longevity and further compliments the citrus and floral aspects of this formulation. This fragrance smells like it is heavily rooted in nature, and although it has patchouli as a base note, it doesn't come off as overly heavy or stifling.     In my opinion, I think that this is a sophisticated, and sparkling fragrance that doesn't smell synthetic. If you are a person who leans towards floral and citrus with a sight nod to woodsy scents that are rooted in nature, then this is a perfect fragrance for you.   *This review was collected as part of a promotion."

			"review_text": "I truly love fragrance and was very excited for my first whiff of No.14 - Icila by Maison Louis Marie. My first impression of this Eau de Parfum was one of elegance. The simplicity of the off white packaging in itself is lovely, clean, and well thought out while the presentation of the perfume itself is equally as appealing in it simplicity and elegance, though my bottle did arrive with a small smudge on the label.   With top notes of ruby pamplemousse, mandarin leaf, and jasmine, mid notes of bulgarian rose, dark plum, and osmanthus, with a base of patchouli, vanilla flower, and sakura blossom, Icila is truly a lovely scent. The scent itself comes off as rather floral but is not overpowering. The initial spray is somewhat strong but not overly so and the scent seems to become more delicate on the skin as the day wears on and it is indeed a lingering scent, I can still smell more than a hint of it on my skin late in the evening. However, although I very much enjoy this perfume, I do wish that I was able to detect more notes of the pamplemousse and the plum, it does come across just a bit too floral for my personal taste. I would though, very much recommend this scent as it is very tasteful and elegant."

This new Maison Louis Marie No.14 Icila Eau de Parfum is so clean and luxurious. The packaging is classic and elegant. There is nothing woody in this perfume and all I smell is flowers and fruity. It‚Äôs not sweet but on a warm and deep side. Initially the plum scent dominated the whole notes and a few moments later I smell a faint powdery Sakura blossom. The jasmine came the last and stays until the end. It smells familiar but unique and it is on the feminine side to me. If you don‚Äôt like woody note in fragrance you have to try this."

It‚Äôs a fine even mist and works well with my body chemistry. When I wear it, I pick up on mainly the floral notes like the Jasmine but it has that dark plum to elevate it and give it more depth. It is a very sophisticated scent without smelling like your grandmas perfume collection. It lasted all day on me and I wore it to a Mother‚Äôs Day brunch and received tons of compliments! It was the perfect scent to wear for this occasion and put me in such a good mood everytime I got a whiff of it! This is my go to spring scent! The No.14 Icila comes in a glass bottle and the design is simple and clean but yet so aesthically pleasing. The notes are included on the outside of the product box, so you know what notes are in this specific fragrance. Maison Louis Marie focuses on quality ingredients that do not harm you or the planet, which makes me praise this brand and their fragrances even more! The Icila fragrance was inspired by the French word ici‚Äù which means here and conveys to us that we should enjoy being here in the moment. This holds true as time is precious and I had a fantastic time enjoying the fragrance while spending time with loved ones. I often relate certain scents with memories and I can see myself creating many more memories while wearing No.14 Icila!"

I am 36 with three kids and the signs of aging are creeping up faster than I would like! I love to try things to combat that while staying out of a doctors office. This perfume scent is gorgeous! It smells floral but clean. It isn‚Äôt as sweet as it is crisp and fresh. The mist is light with a fine particle spray. The bottle is lovely and looks like crystal on a vanity. The scent lasts all day and smells absolutely expensive. I receive so many compliments when I wear this. It‚Äôs a mature scent that I would recommend to 20 year olds and up.

I could also smell the hints of jasmine  and patchouli but not much of Bulgarian rose and vanilla flower. This is a beautiful fragrance for summer which will have people guessing what you are wearing. The scent will leave all the amazing key notes lingering in the air. It‚Äôs a light scent so won‚Äôt give you or anyone a headache. I also think this will be beautiful to mix with other fragrances. I like how it smells on me and I even tried it spraying on the clothes it also settles into a beautiful scent.
