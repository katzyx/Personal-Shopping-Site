			"review_text": "I've been waiting for Kaja to release true cool toned trios so I bought Taro Bubble Tea when it launched and while the shades are pretty, I'm not impressed with the formulas.  The matte shade is pigmented but quite dry and can become patchy when blending and the shimmer is actually the best of the three but it's more sheer than it appears in photos and even with glitter glue, I often end up with more sparkles on my face than eyes. The glitter formula is terrible; just big pieces of plastic glitter with no back pigment that doesn't translate to more than a few rogue pieces on the lids until they also migrate to my cheeks. All in all, the pretty color can't make up for the bad formulas and I will not be keeping it."

My eyes are still very irritated as I write this.   Shade Glowing Guava: This is a commentary on Sephora's order fulfillment and not the actual shade: I ordered this shade on Dec 26 and it arrived Dec 29. I did not have a chance to try it because arrived OPENED and was EXPIRED as of 2023-12-02. Disgusting. Obviously returned without issue.   Overall, very disappointed."

I expected a light, slightly flaky texture for the shimmers and a smooth, easily buildable matte shade. The gold shade (Wedding Champagne) is a chunky mess and the pink shade (mauve veil) is deeper than the matte shade and appears much deeper than the ads/promos. The matte shade (Velvet Carpet) is lighter than expected and not as blendable/buildable as Kaja mattes usually are (patchy). It also started to fade after 4 hours which isn't a problem I usually encounter with Kaja mattes.  I can't use this trio as a stand alone which is disappointing. Wedding Champagne looks terrible with Mauve Veil and overpowers Velvet Carpet. Mauve Veil is deeper than Velvet Carpet but they aren't a tonal miss. I just need a darker/deeper shade.  I reach for a trio on days when I want a quick eye look. It's the convenience and love for the shimmers that have kept me reaching for the trios (and purchasing more). I can't see myself reaching for Mauve Bouquet. I can't complete an eye look with just this trio and a basic (chunky) gold, pink shimmer and mid-tone plummy brown aren't unique in my collection. Wish I could rate this 0 stars as it isn't worth even 1."

The method that seems to work best is picking up the glitter on my pointer finger. I go in like I'm going to swatch it, and then pat it on my eyelid. This method seems to yield the best result and it's the one I've had the more success with. One piece of advice, make sure to have a spare brush just to wipe away any of the glitter fallout. I find that the fallout is pretty minimal, however it can be annoying when there are little spots of glitter on your under eyes or cheeks. Having something near you just to wipe it away is helpful. Solid trio, I have invested in other colors, but this one seems to be the one I mostly gravitate towards."

I find the two darker shades to be more reddish than they appear in the photo and once I applied it, it was difficult to blend away to lighten it once it set. If you’re looking for a bolder color, I think this would be great for you. It does blend well when first applied, but difficult if you let it set, so be careful with that. I really like that it didn’t crease or fade at all on my lid. My eyelids fold when open, so some shadows will rub off where it creases, but this stays put. I wish there was a more subtle brown palate with no sparkles."

I loved the matte and shimmer trios most but after seeing I can change them out it was a game changer and time for me to collect them all. all of them compliment each other in my opinion too so you can mix and match from any trio. they blend like a dream and are perfect for beginners and people on the go. I am a Kaja fan for sure and everything I've tried so far I am in love with. packaging is so cute and they don't feel or look cheap. I hope and believe this company will be around and become huge as people notice and try the brand as time goes on. I don't just recommend I am begging everyone to at least try this brand. it's worth the money and honestly it is pretty budget friendly. one trio can give you more then one look to create and like I said you can change out colours as you buy more. try them, I can't imagine living without these now."

The colors are pretty but I just don't think the 3 shades are worth the price when you can get other mini palettes with twice as many colors in similar sized pans. They are also inconsistent - the dark shade is super pigmented, the middle shade is mid, and the sparkle shade, like others mentioned, needs to be applied with fingers.   It's definitely a quick and easy eye look, I just wish you got more for your $$$."

I really don’t know much about eyeshadow and it always would look bad on me before I would use this, but after using this product I somehow manage to come out with a really beautiful eyeshadow look. Also, the yellow shade in this is a GORGEOUS toned down yellow and the shimmer shade on top looks lovely. It is pretty natural looking though.   I think the best thing about these trios is that they are very beginner friendly because they are colors that will definitely work together, and the pictures on the models (along with the little guides) help a lot! It helps me learn about shadow application and I feel like I’m getting better at makeup!"

But in person they aren’t as dark as I hoped they would be, and especially the middle brown shade really isn’t that pigmented. It’s a nice transition shade but again it’s not as dark as I hoped it would be. And then the shimmer shade barely shows up on my skin. So while the shades are pretty and they do blend nicely, they aren’t quite what I hoped they would be. I also hoped with the name “bouncy” they would have a different texture, more of a cream to powder like the Colour Pop Super Shock shadows. If these weren’t so expensive I would probably keep it but $20+ just doesn’t seem worth it for me."

The shimmer shade is more of a glitter topper without much pigment, and the matte shades are more of a neutral undertone instead of leaning warm which I would have preferred on my light medium olive skin. The shades are almost exact dupes for shades in the colourpop going coconuts palette and that’s a 9 pan palette for half the cost and maybe even better payoff. I took pictures to compare. I think I would have liked the spiked ginger one better but even those shades can be duped in another cp palette. I would say save your money and get more bang for your buck with one of theirs instead."

I’m a medium neutral skin tone and found the middle shade too cool, looked very dull on my skin tone. The darkest shade isn’t bad but very warm-red. The shimmer shade is more icy looking in person. It leans more champagne/silver than gold and is very chunky/glitter. I was expecting something buttery, easy to work with that would draw the light, but it’s just a very cool shimmer.   I can see this palette working on those with much lighter or medium, tan warm skin tones. It’s very muddy looking on my neutral skin tone and looks nothing like what it shows up as online.   I’m sure it’s sold out for a reason. But didn’t work for me or my skin tone. Both in colour theory and formula. Not a fan. Cute packaging though!"

And as someone who likes neutrals and only used 1-3 eyeshadow shades on an average day I thought the description of “neutral cocoa” would be perfect for me. I had no trouble blending the 2 matte shades and they were plenty pigmented. My reason for 3 stars is that I felt the middle shade was extremely orange on my fair skin. Based on the photo of the swatch I was expecting a neural light taupe like color.  The darker matte was a little more warm toned than I had thought it would be too. The shimmer shade is pretty true to color but be ware it is glitter. I think the quality and convenience is there, perhaps my skin just has undertones that make the shades appear a bit warmer than expected."

It applies so beautifully, and the middle shade is close to my skin and looks like wet glimmer on the eyes and it's sooo gorgeous.

Of course it’s only three colors but you can create some to die for looks with these! I got the “poppy champagne” trio and will be ordering more! There’s a reason these shimmers won Allure’s Beauty award. Pigmented and long lasting. I used Urban Decay’s primer potion so I can’t speak on its use without primer but with, my shadow looked freshly applied a good 8-10 hours later and counting. Giving 4 stars instead of 5 because it did take a little bit of effort to build up the color but that’s just what happens sometimes so by no means is that a deal breaker.

The shimmer formula in the other 3 bentos is chunky and 10x as glittery as SG.   I still really like SG even though the shimmer was different than I was anticipating. It is warm without being too warm. I usually struggle with warm mattes looking too orange on me. This trio has the PERFECT amount of warmth without turning my eyelids into pumpkins.   Overall, I really like how compact these eyeshadows are and I enjoy the color stories that Kaja chooses. I am really tempted to get Mocha Spritz next."

The glitter shade is okay but it's a bit much for me personally so I used the middle shade as an all-over and the bottom as a liner shade. Totally worth it for me, I hope I can try more of these trios soon."

The formula is nice although I will say that I don’t find these shadows to be creamy. They feel like powder eyeshadows. Idk if they were trying to go for the same texture like colourpop super shock shadows. If you have any of those shadows those do feel creamy almost wet like but they dry down to a powder. These shadows are definitely not that but none the less they are very good and the price is right in my opinion. The shadow with glitter is really beautiful and the shine I get from it is really nice. I do notice a bit of fall out with the glitter shadow but not too much. I’ve tried other glitter shadows that just have tons and tons of fallout surprisingly this shadow had minimal fall out which I love. I definitely recommend this product and I will be picking up a few more. The trio I have is glowing guava. Oh and there is a mirror if that is something that is important to you."

The shimmers on both can very easily be made to be blinding! They can be used as a highlighter too. They’re extremely travel friendly and you can create a whole look with just one trio. I seriously want them all now!!!!"

I then went to do a sweaty hour-long workout in 90 degrees.  The staying power was great, with NO creasing, and minimal glitter fallout. These can also be applied wet for a more intense, foiled look. The shimmer shades are very similar to Urban Decay Moondust, except you get 3 shades for the price of one UD shadow! I think I'll be back for more ;)"

Online the shades look similar to one another, but in person they're so distinguishable from one another, it's wonderful. I also think the packaging and the size of the pans are perfect, for either everyday or for travel. As someone who has loved makeup for as long as I can remember (and even worked at Sephora on the floor!) I'm genuinely baffled at the few reviews that talk about the size of the eyeshadow pans being small. Like, girl what? Check the weight of the eyeshadow pans you have at home because I can ~assure~ you, the vast majority of them are not 0.9g worth of product per pan like these. These are a really, really good size for an eyeshadow. Get these shadows - you'll look like JLo just getting back from the Bahamas."

I have never really worn eye makeup much because of a combination of sensitive eyes and my tendency to lean towards very basic, no makeup-makeup looks, but this stuff is so easy to blend and it doesn't irritate my eyes or skin! It's not a super intense pigment, but not outrageously light either. Reasonably medium, buildable powders!  It doesn't crease too much--I've noticed a few times at the very end of the day I'll see a bit of creasing, but that's after at least about 10-12 hours of wear, and I haven't used eyeshadow primer so I think that's a likely explanation.  The colours in this trio are so beautiful too, I'm getting lots of use out of the middle sparkly shade and a similar amount from the lighter pink. I'm looking forward to trying the darker pinky/mauve for a bolder look one day when I build up the courage! Will definitely repurchase this when the need arises, and I'm looking into other shades already. Definitely recommend!"

The mattes blend out beautifully just like ND or Viseart shadows and the glitters are so creamy and easy to apply. They give you the perfect wet lid look, which I am obsessed with all year round! The glitters do have fall out but that doesn’t bother me at all and I can easily swipe it away with a clean brush, but just keep that in mind if it is a deal breaker for you. I recommend these to everyone! I feel so weird posting these photos, but these are my only pictures that show the Rosewater (pink) and the Chocolate Dahlia (brown) on my lid really well!"

The light color is a warm, sunset pink, the middle is a midd-tone cherry-candy and the dark is a rich bordeaux (i even skip my eyeliner). Seriously, best eyeshadow purchase of my life.

It shows up as a bold color trio with a good amount of pigmentation, but it just isn't.  I have super pale skin and even I have issues getting the mattes to show up that boldly on me.  It takes a lot of building up to get to the same pigmentation as seen in the swatches.  I wouldn't mind a very subtle korean-inspired eyeshadow trio, but I want it to be advertise like that when its being swatched.  Anyways that is my main problem with this.  I absolutely adore the packaging, its so easy for travel.  I could toss this in my purse and not worry a single bit.  I also adore the mirror it has on top.  I actually do like the subtleness of the color shades of orange and red for a softer, more work appropriate pop of color.  There is no fallout and the shimmer actually does show up quiet well.  I do recommend this, but be aware that it is a softer touch of color and not a super bold pop of color."

If you like or need to use a matte shadow to complete your look and you don't want to have to open another eye palette, just double check to make sure the set you're buying has one. The shimmer shades definitely have some reflect, almost seems like a micro glitter, and look beautiful on top of any look. I do notice that there is occasionally some minor fall out with the glitters in the shimmers, but nothing too crazy and it doesn't feel like a chunky glitter. Pigmentation is decent on the matte shades, and they blend fairly well. Might crease a little if you don't wear an eyeshadow primer and have oily eyelids like me. If you own any super shock shadows from colourpop, they're about the same size."

I have received so many compliments when I wear this eye shadow all over my lip and I would definitely recommend the Kaja shimmer eye shadow trios to anyone looking for a high quality glitter that is easy to apply and looks great all day!

No, because a makeup goblin lives in me that wants me to buy everything shiny thing I see.

The mattes are buttery without being too pigmented to blend, the shimmers are out of this world without even having to wet the brush. Now don’t get me wrong, these little things are expensive. But the pans are the same size you normally see in palettes, just in a little compact case that is very easy to store and use. I highly recommend these."

Like any glittery substance, there’s fallout so if you do your foundation first, prepare for that but that’s just expected.  What I love is that usually these high shine shadows crease and transfer on my hooded eyes, but not this one, it stayed put all day and looked gorgeous up until I took it off.  I’m a mom with a high energy toddler, so if makeup stays put through my day, it’s a win. On and The packaging is ADORABLE!"

The matte shades in this trio are simple, beautiful and sophisticated. When I tried the shimmery colour on top, I literally gasped. It looked so bomb you guys, I can’t even contain my excitement. It is such a cute palette and so travel friendly. So easy to toss in my purse and touch up discreetly. I am absolutely in love. Good job kaja."

The chocolate dahlia is my perfect neutral browns. Not too warm not too cool.

I'm next about to purchase either Hello Azalea or Glowing Guava.

Unless you hold them to the light they're pretty indistinguishable when worn and tend to blend together, meaning you can't really create a full eye look with just these shades. When paired with other palettes though they add a ton of pop, and the price point is decent. I also own this in Sparkling Rosé and all three of those shades are pretty different, so the color similarity issue I had is probably just unique to the Rosewater colorway. If you love pinks or lighter shades though I still think this is worth a buy; the glitter is really well-formulated and high quality."

This product meets all those requirements and for a reasonable price. I love the variety of looks you can create using just one trio! The shade Rosewater is 3 gorgeous shades of pinks and purple, each shade beautiful worn alone or mixed together. The stacked trio is so cute and convenient! I love to mix two shades together and layer for intensity. Over primer, these shadows literally look as amazing at the end of my day as when first applied. I love that the shadow is so quick and easy to apply using your finger and does not even require a brush! This product is perfect whether you are a beginner or a professional!"

Also, at least in the Orange Blossom trio,  the three colors are similar so it almost looks like the application is of one color only.

I found the matte shades to be easily blendable. (I used a primer and neutral/nude colored shadow all over my lid before applying.) The pigmentation of the matte shades is good, but not the best. I had to layer the middle shade in the Hella Azalea trio three times to achieve the true color. The glitter shade is a beautiful, blinding glitter that applies well when packed on the lid with a stiff brush (needs a primer under it for sure) but has a decent amount of fall out. Overall, I would purchase again (or in more combinations) because I love how ease they are to travel with! I recieved this product for free in exchange for a review"

This little trio is a MUST HAVE. They are very shimmery and the color payoff is great while still looking very natural. If you're looking for a full coverage eyeshadow- this may not be for you. So far I have applied them with a brush (wet and dry) as well as my finger and both work great. I used the urban decay eyeshadow primer (as I always do) and it stayed without creasing... even on my oily eyelids. Not much fallout either!"

I did receive this to try from Influenster but I seriously would buy another one I’m that in love. Buy it already!"

However, the shadows blend nicely upon application. My biggest complaint is that both colors I received don’t have a good transition shade, and it’s hard to do a full eye look with just the three colors in any given stack. If you’re looking for something fun to add to your collection or maybe a few extra colors to toss in your travel bag, these are great!

It’s actually fabulous and so easy to use, you have a whole look with the 3 colors you get easily, but honestly, those shimmers need a ton of work. They are dry and powdery, they don’t even build up, they are lack luster and the shimmer is not strong at all. I wasn’t impressed with this shimmer formula at all. Now these are easy to pick up and travel with and you can get 3 shadows in a container the size of a lip balm pot, it’s easy and quick, the tiny mirror is useless, it’s the size of a quarter, that really is unnecessary, maybe that would have brought the price down.

Purples are a difficult shade to make so it didn't surprise me that it took some work to build up, but eventually I got it to a place I liked. i applied the mattes with brushes. The shimmers are really pretty, but they do take some building up & don't pack quite as much of a punch as I wish they did. They're still pretty & give a nice glittery effect. I applied them alone & over a layer of concealer but I like it both ways. I preffered them with a finger or a wet brush. All in all super cute I imagine great for traveling."

I really enjoyed the shades and the color payoff of the matte colors, but the shimmer color was a real challenge to apply and it barely showed once it was on my lid. I even used my fingertip because I know that works better for shimmer shadows. I did use a brush for the matte colors, so I will try a brush next time and see if that makes a difference. The packaging is adorable but a little awkward to work with at times. Overall, the texture is good and the I created turned out cute so I will probably use it again but I would not pay full price for it."

I love the packaging and how I can literally just toss it in my drawer when I'm done or in a bag when I travel. The mirror that comes in it, is pointless though. these are incredibly pigmented and blend like a champ. I could have used all of the guava trio by itself and been happy but I used all 6 shades together from the 2 trios that I have, and came up with an amazing look! Honestly I dont know why these aren't talked about more.  Now that I know how much I love them, I will start getting more colors that I enjoy."

They're conveniently small for throwing into any makeup bag unlike those regular large or narrow eye shadow palettes. These weigh like nothing so it's perfect to carry around. I'm also a huge fan of beauty products made in Korea so this is a winner for me!"

They take up so little space in your makeup bag, while giving you the variety you can find in a palette. The colors are pretty, packed with pigment and go on very smooth. The glittery shades can definitely fall below your lashes, so I would advise using a primer with these shadows and having loose powder and a brush nearby to wipe away excess glitter."

The Bento Beauty eyeshadow trios went on so effortlessly and so smooth, it almost feels as if I'm not even wearing any eyeshadow. The eyeshadow is pigmented enough to show up after one or two applications but not pigmented enough to stain your skin. This set is honestly my favorite pieces of makeup that I own, it is very light and feels as if I'm not wearing any makeup, I tested all of the eyeshadows on my arm before applying and it came off with a makeup wipe not making my skin look bruised.   PRO TIP: experiment with the colors before deciding what you do because there are so many ways to just make these colors pop and look amazing on your eyes"

I had to dip in a few times to get the color payoff. No fallout at all which is nice. They blend really smoothly as well. The shimmers definitely look better and more blinding when u use a damp brush (as do most shimmer shades). I also got the “Hella Azalea” trio and those colors are bright and beautiful as well. The pink shimmer in that one is gorgeous. I think the price is a little much only due to the fact that they aren’t super pigmented, but thankfully I got both of mine as complimentary testers from Influenster."

I used the purple in my crease, blended it out with the pinky shade, and the shimmer on the lid. I think this is an interesting and innovative product, I like how there are 2 mattes and a shimmer, easy and quick for everyday wear. Throw a color on the crease, deepen it up, and put the shimmer on the lid. The mattes are pigmented but not one swipe pigmented. I did have to build the purple a couple times which is typical of purples for me. The shimmer on the other hand is beautiful. So creamy, so reflective, simply goregous. I would recommend these probably for those who don’t do elaborate eye looks and want just a few shades for a quick eye look. There are trios with neutral everyday shades which would be good for more wearable looks. I love pink and purple so I liked the hella azalea trio but I know it’s not for everyone. Overall I really like the product and can’t wait to play with it more"

I tested my shadows out by doing my makeup at 3:30 pm before I went to a rodeo. Picture sweat, dust, dirt, excessive heat, bulls, horses, screaming kids, THE WORKS! I went to take my “after” picture at 3:30 am (12 hours after applying with no eye primer) and it still looked EXACTLY the same.

I can contour and bake my face all day long, but I can’t apply eyeshadow for crap. So when I opened the box and saw this product, at first I was like oh great...I’m not gonna be able to play with this like it’s meant to. But I was actually wrong, these colors blend together really easily and are also really pigmented. The Glowing Guava set is so much better than the other one I received, Hella Azalea. The colors in Glowing Guava have more pigment to them and blend together much better. They can be used for a day and night look and are very compact. Definitely would recommend for somebody that is traveling or somebody looking to get a full eyeshadow look quickly."

I’m glad I got to sample these because I had never heard or seen of these before and I can almost guarantee, I’ll be buying more of these once I’m out. They’re the perfect little size to throw down in your purse or leave in the car for when you’re in a rush, which I really appreciate while being in school. Hella Azalea pairs beautifully with a pink lipgloss, Glowing Guava looks beautiful with a nude lip."

The Kaja bentos are also really long lasting. For the glittery shades, you will have some fall out by the end of the day.

The shadows are more neutral and less rosy than they appear in the photo, never the less I still enjoy them.  These shades work well for light-medium skintones but I don't think the mattes would be good for deeper complexions. The shimmer shade can give a lot of fallout so I make sure to use a sticky base and to do my undereye concealer after I do my eyes. All in all a great product :)"

These do look beautiful over other shadows or if you WANT a translucent glitter topper, but I was disappointed."

I had no issues with fall out but did use it on top of my paint pot, and I patted/tapped it on, I did not swipe. Honestly, any more shimmery/glittery product is likely to fall if you swipe it on, so just be gentle and pat it on like you're an Instagram model and you'll be good to go! lol. I might have to pick up another one, I'm loving it so much. I'm curious to see how their matte shades will work out, but the all shimmer ones are a perfect addition to those with more matte collections. Or if you're travelling just put some bronzer in your crease (and over your lid if you're feeling wild) and tap this on, so easy and so beautiful!!!"

			"review_text": "I'm not a huge fan of eyeshadow palettes and often don't have time to put together well-thought out eyeshadow looks, so when they included mattes in these eyeshadow trios I absolutely had to try them out. How I like to apply this is putting the top shade all over the lid with a fluffy eyeshadow brush, darkening the outer corner with the bottom shade, and using my finger to apply the middle shade across the lid to add dimension. I can achieve a gorgeous, put-together eye look without even having to think about it, which I love. I'd say these shadows blend fairly easily (not effortlessly), the matte shades aren't creamy enough to apply with a finger but as someone with extremely oily eyelids I often prefer a slightly drier shadow formula. Out of all my eyeshadows, this formula definitely creased the least on me, and lasted without fading and with minimal creasing for about 12 hours. The shades are really pretty, but a little more brownish mauve than pink in my opinion. I wish these shadows were a bit lighter and brighter for summer looks, but they are really gorgeous, I just prefer a more illuminated, colorful eye look. Overall, great product, and I would definitely try more shades!"

The glitter fallout is minimal, and this doesn’t settle into any creases or give you those pockets where the glitter has “worn off”. It stays all day, and into the evening. But when it’s time to take your makeup off before bed, it comes off so easily and without spreading glitter everywhere. Love this, and look forward to exploring Kaja’s brand more."

If you’re younger with minimal fine lines they can be worn on their own but if you’re older they work well to brighten the eyes. I use matte shades as a base and then add 1 or 2 of these shadows to brighten up just the center of my mobile lid. There is no real glitter here, just shimmer. If you pack it on with your finger there is no fall out. I like that it’s only a trio in each package because having too many choices in one palette can be overwhelming on days when I’m in a hurry. With these I can decide quickly what I want for the day and still look great as if I had spent a lot more time doing my eyes. I have sensitive eyes but these do not bother me at all. Very comfortable wear, long lasting and easily blended. I am looking forward to buying other shades in the near future. These rose tones are pink enough to show up on any skin tone but read more as healthy glow than pink eye infection. Any eye color would look great with this set. It’s very neutral toned, not too cool and still not too warm. Perfect balance in between that can work for anyone."

Great formula and easy to blend , no creasing and not a ton of fallout either . So far very happy with this product and would recommend to others that normally like Anastasia or Too Faced . I did recieve this product at no coast as part of an Influenster box and I would definitely buy these and restock when I finish them or buy them as a gift for a girlfriend ."

These products have horrible fall out. I’m wearing them right now and I’m completely covered in glitter. They blend fairly well. I tried them all together and it doesn’t really work without a matte. I attached a picture of my favorite shade to show the fall out on the product! I received this product complimentary for review purposes."

I was a little surprised and worried when I received it, because it is not only small and extremely sparkly, but ORANGE as well, not blush or bronze.   However, the colors went on lovely together and did end up highlighting my warm skin tone and brown eyes.  This does not look weirdly orange on.   It looks beautiful and natural!   Still, 4/5 because the colors are more orange than in the photos online, and I think I would have rather gone with the more caramel colored set."

My eyelids are a little greasy, so I need to put a little concealer or primer to prevent the shadow from cracking in the basin. It was spectacular to see. They are so soft, versatile and pigmented.

This eye shadow is as glittery as it looks which makes it perfect for that special night out. I had this on for a couple of hours and it did not budge. I did use a moisturizing base underneath and per other reviews, that could be the reason this stayed put.

I’ve used all shades with and without a brush and fingers works best but can still come out pigmented with a brush. But if you want ultimate pigmentation make sure to use your fingers. Looks lasted all night with very no creasing and wear. The formula is very smooth and buttery. Also not a lot of fall out, but they are all shimmers so you can’t expect to not get fallout.

The hues are absolutely gorgeous and they look phenomenal when you just swipe your fingers over them. What I really appreciate is that there is very little fallout during application so I didn’t have microscopic littler cracks if shimmery eye shadow under my eyes. On the other hand, the shimmer really didn’t work for me. I have low creases and slightly downturned eyes which make it hads for shadows to show up when I wear them. Shimmery shadows have an especially hard time showing up, and this particular set had larger bits of glitter that wasn’t particularly flattering on my eyelids. I’d recommend for people with larger eyelid real estate. Also because the shimmer is so beautiful, I’d love to try this on as a highlighter."

The sparkle that you get from these shadows is something I’ve only ever seen in k-beauty eyeshadows. I think these shadows are well worth the price as they’re very high quality and quite versatile.

All 3 shades have about the same formula, so it is consistent. They are very pigmented, with a lot of shimmer, and micro glitters. They feel very light on the eyes, not heavy at all. I like all three shades, but the middle shade is my fave. If you are not familiar with Korean makeup, it is more muted and natural than typical American makeup. These shadows are slightly muted in color, but pigmented in that muted color, if that makes sense. Basically, they are easy to blend, apply well with fingers for ease of application, and look very pretty yet natural on the eyes. I definitely want to pick up another shade or two. I just love these for travel bc it is so compact. The only possible downside I could think of is that there are no transition shades, however I don’t think you really need them. You could either use them on their own, or combine with a basic palette, or even a blush or bronzer (that’s what I’ve been doing when traveling).

However you really need to use your fingers to apply (I can't get the same effect using brushes even when wet), and it's impossible to get all the glitter/shimmer off your hands when you wash up otherwise. The colors also don't blend very well in my opinion, you quickly lose the contrast in the three colors when you blend them. But as a one eyelid shade per look this trio is fantastic. Extra plus the packaging is space efficient."

I really wish they had included a matte brown shade instead of one of the shimmers bc then I could only carry this around to do a quick eye look when I’m doing my make up on the way or taking it to vacation! Otherwise, this is super beautiful combination of warm tone shimmers that I would use as a topper for my eyes and highlight inner corner and underneath my eyes. I like the idea of putting three in one not as a palette but on top of each other! Feels like they take less space in my beauty bag. I’m definitely including this in my everyday routine from now on. It was long lasting (with Wet n Wild eyelid primer) and I used my finger for a subtle application, but this definitely layers in pigment and saturation of shimmers."

I love all the shades but my favorite the the Baked Cinnamon shade. These apply so well and they are super blendable if you are using it with other shadows. I wore this for about 6 hours and they were not a glittery mess—super long-wearing!! Also I got so many compliments wearing these shadows, which is a plus! I’m excited to collect some more! Highly recommend trying these baddies out if you’re looking for some shine for your looks!"

This eyeshadow trio is  very pigmented, I'm use to loading my brush up with Shimmers, glitters and matte eyeshadow colors. So I grab alot to pack on the color and to my surprise I actually had to wipe it off. I put too much on the first time! That really shocked me. A little goes a long way! If you're tired of the mess that comes with loose Shimmers and glitters, tired of using glue to adhere glitter, then get this! This product is also versatile.... I used it as a highlighter too. It's texture is  silky and smooth! Perfect base and finish look. No streaking or looking patchy! Also no fall out either! Must try ! I really enjoyed it! Colors showed up on my beautiful dark brown skin, without me using an eyeshadow base or primer! Eyeshadow stayed on full untill I washed my face! Very easy to remove! No skin breakouts or red, itchy eyes."

This gives you an intense shimmer all day long on your eyelids. It truly rivals all the other glitter toppers out there right now. This gives you a very pigmented, high sparkle look. I've used this alone, as well as layered over regular powder shadow; both are great. I like it better over another shadow because it doesn't crease as soon (I had about four hours of no creasing, with no shadow, no primer, nothing underneath; with just a powder eyeshadow (no primer) it lasted the entire workday without creasing on me. I have dry eyelids so this obviously might not work for people with oily lids). Truly these are fantastic and I am so glad I was able to try them; this will be a staple in my sparkle routine.

Even without primer it did not crease after 3hours and I have oily lids. Very minimal fall out even applied with finger. But I do recommend wearing them with a eye primer. However, do I think 26$ CAD justifies the product? Well, hmmmm. Even I bought them with the discount  20% Vib rouge, I still think it is pricey. The product is smaller than you think. The packaging is cute, good quality but bare in mind the trio can’t be twisted on the side in order to use them all. So let’s say you use the 1st color, either you close it or let it still open but can’t see properly the next color you want to use. Which is not practical at all unless you have the patience and have plenty of time to do your make up lol. Overall, yes I recommend them but try to buy them whenever you have a discount."

I’ve had mine a few months and it hasn’t dried out at all.

I put one in my purse & the other one in my gym bag so that they get me out of a pickle in situations when I want to look more made up on days that I leave the house with no makeup on.

It has a drier formula that’s different from the metallic wet shadows from other brands (ex makeup geek foiled shadows). It’s better as a glitter topper because there’s not much colour payoff, it doesn’t swatch well on hands but they are beautiful on the eyes. Some fall out especially used with dry brushes, would recommend using fingers or wet brush with spray. Overall i still love this.

The fallout is extremely minimal for a glitter, and if there happens to be any it can easily be brushed away with a powder brush. After trying these shadows for the first time, I immediately ordered all the other shades. I usually apply with my fingers and it blends like a dream, and the lightest shades of each set make the inner corner pop like no other shadow I have tried. Don’t let the darker colors of the sets scare you away, they are so beautiful on the outer edges of the eyes! Also, the packaging is so convenient for traveling, and the pan sizes definitely give you your money’s worth. This product is a must-have in your makeup bag!"

I was late to work because i had to fix my makeup before I could even leave the house! maybe with tonnes of primer or as a topper this would work better, but even hand swatches disappeared almost immediately after 5 minutes with no rubbing. will be returning today.  loved the colors but such a poor product."

The other star is for effort... The description of this product led me to believe that it would be creamier with more pigmentation. I even watched youtube reviews to see how they performed. I bought two trios- Orange Blossom and the darkest pink one. The shadows all performed consistently... bad. They're dry and have insane fallout. They're GLITTERY to a fault because they end up falling all over your cheeks and face by the end of the day. Back to lack of pigmentation- these are sheer. I know, can you believe it? With a brush, they're so sheer. With my finger, I barely can build it up. What a disappointment /:"

It’s really not a cream as they describe it, it’s very powdery and there was a lot of fall out. I used shadow primer and within 3 hours the glitter had traveled all over my face and it had totally creased and was uneven on my lids. Please test this in the store before making the mistake I did."

All three colors are glittery but pigmented enough to show up, and complement each other well.  They get a little muddy when I layer them, but alone would make nice toppers for shadows you may have in other palettes.  I tried them dry, and without primer, and still got good results.  For the price and the payoff, the Kaja trio is worth it!  Look forward to trying other products from this brand."

I highly recommend doing your eyelook first if you plan on wearing these shadows! You will have glitter galore if you aren’t careful! Your best bet is to press in the shadow rather than brushing it away with a brush for the eyes!"

Whenever i wear the middle orange shade people stop and ask me what i'm wearing. The beauty bento is so easy to wear and use that I could pop it into my bag for any occasion and feel like my eye look is on point."
