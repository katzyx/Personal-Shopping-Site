Most of the brushes I have used over the years always manage to take off either my foundation or concealer. This brush not only is smooth and soft, but allowed for my concealer to be applied easily. The dual ended is also super handy, since it could be used either for blush/ bronzer on one end and the more skinny end is for the concealer."

The bristles are incredibly soft, they don‚Äôt shed and they blend everything so seamlessly. You can use it for foundation, blush, contour bronzer. You name it. It really is a must have brush in my collection and would recommend it 100%. And the same goes for this new complexion brush. When the makeup artist used it on my face, I could barely feel it from how soft it was, It didn‚Äôt feel rough or like it was poking my under eye, Didn‚Äôt leave any streaks with splotches. Refy just keeps on bringing the heat with these new launches I can‚Äôt wait to see what else they have in store for us!"
