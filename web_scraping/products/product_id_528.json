			"review_text": "I recently tried FORVR Mood's NDA, and it‚Äôs quickly become one of my favorite fragrances. NDA has this alluring blend of fruity and floral notes with a hint of musk that feels like a perfect balance between sophisticated and playful.  The top notes are a mix of citrus and berry, which give it a bright, refreshing opening. Then, as it settles, you start to notice the floral middle notes ‚Äì soft but lush, making it feel elegant and feminine. What I love most is the warm base of vanilla and musk, which gives it a sensual finish that lingers beautifully on the skin.  The longevity is impressive, lasting most of the day with just a few spritzes, and the sillage is just right ‚Äì it‚Äôs noticeable without being overpowering. The packaging also feels luxurious and adds a stylish touch to any perfume collection.  If you‚Äôre looking for a fragrance that‚Äôs sophisticated with a hint of flirtatiousness, NDA is definitely worth trying. It‚Äôs versatile enough for both day and night wear, making it a perfect all-rounder for any occasion!"

If I apply at 7:30am it wanes on the skin by 12:30/1pm. It lasts longer on clothes. If longevity is a concern wear it for a date or a short-time occasion."
