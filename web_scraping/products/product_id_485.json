			"review_text": "I am sharing my honest and authentic opinion, as a Sephora Beauty Insider Community Ambassador. This is a wonderful formula. It is not too drying and not too creamy to make such a wonderfully pigmented and long-lasting liner. I have 2 of these, and I love the classic pencil format. I like to pair this shade with a pink shade or tinted lip balm."

I was very interested in the lip liners they had, especially the darkest brown shade which is Hickory Brown. I love the liner, especially the shade because it's I feel like it's THE dark brown that me, being a medium brown skin tone, yellow and gold under tone, really needs. LOVE"
