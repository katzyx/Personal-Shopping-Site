Now, I don't have to try so hard to get concealers to play nice with my  dry, mature, wrinkled skin. Let set before applying makeup and use a light hand with light layers. An extremely light application of a setting powder (loose IT Powder for example) is recommended for mature skin. -2024"

Sometimes I'll add for day time. When I wear makeup my whole under eye area is smoothed and blurred out too so l don't have to use as much concealer. When it comes to application, I'll apply around dark circles area all throughout corners of my eyes up to my eyebrow bone area. For excess i just apply around upper cheeks lol. It does a really great job keeping skin feeling hydrated in this area. I have sensitive skin too and no bad scent or irritation from this. I highly recommend!"

It has a classic floral scent that reminds me of something youu2019d find on your grandmotheru2019s vanity. This might be offensive to some, but I personally donu2019t mind it. Overall I really enjoy using this and feel like it does help replenish the tired skin under my eyes, while also helping to diminish the appearance of fine lines. However, I donu2019t think Iu2019d purchase this at the price point because Iu2019ve used less expensive eye products that give me the desired result; that being said, if you love luxurious skincare and want a product that will last you a LONG time, I think youu2019d enjoy this product.

I have been using it for the past few weeks and have noticed a huge difference in my overall appearance around my eyes. I have a bad habit of rubbing my eyes, which in turn have caused a few light wrinkles around them. Shiseido Benefiance Wrinkle Smoothing Eye Cream Has helped reduce the appearance of the wrinkles around my eyes. It has helped keeping it moisturized too. The tub is small and perfect for a travel bag. A little goes a long ways. The cream itself is silky and smooth. It is high quality and worth every cent. It deserves more than five stars. I highly recommend it to everyone!"

However, I was sent a free jar to try in return for my review so I pressed on. I dabbed a small amount under both eyes and within within moments experienced a burning sensation. I thought it might be a tingling sensation that would only last a short time, but the pain worsened the longer it was on. It started burning terribly, reddened my skin, and caused my eyes to water so I had to remove it. Therefore, I was unable to evaluate its effect on wrinkles. If you have sensitive skin or prefer unscented skincare, I do not recommend this product."

While I had my experience using this cream was largely pleasant, I did not notice any significant changes in my eye area during my 4+ weeks of use. Although the cream is very thick, it absorbs well and lays beautifully under concealer with no pilling or smudging of eye makeup layered on top. Any wrinkle reduction was only due to extra hydration that plumped up the skin around my eyes a little.   I do however, want to call attention to the fact that, while being marketed as a luxury product, this eye cream is composed primarily of mineral oil and paraffin along with a host of other potentially harmful chemicals, including parabens. The price tag on this item is certainly not justified given the cheap ingredients used as its chief components.   Although this eye cream performed just fine and felt very rich, I recommend looking for an anti-aging eye cream that uses cleaner ingredients and more advanced technology, rather than relying on a petroleum-based product for your delicate and absorbent eye area."

I used to assume that luxury product companies know what they're doing/lead the way for top tier skin care without including any ingredients that could be harmful, but I'm learning they have plenty of ingredients that can cause issues with my skin. One in particular, Microcrystalline wax, from my understanding is a cause for Milia, which is an issue that I have had to address before with my dermatologist, so I try hard to not purchase items that will cause more so I won't have to be treated for it again. That, for me, is kind of a big knock against it since my skin is prone to Milia. It makes me gun shy to use the product.   Pros: Nice, heavy glass jar that feels like good quality and plastic spatula included for application. Cream was nice and light, didn't feel sticky or heavy/greasy which I appreciate because I don't like how that feels on my hands, let alone my face, especially because my face tends to run oily anyway. I can't speak to under eye/bags puffiness because I don't really have that issue, but I DID notice a subtle difference in terms of fine lines/wrinkles. I'm not sure if it was just filling them in or actually plumping my skin to make it appear more youthful, but I'm happy with the results either way! I will say, though, that I preferred using it out of the shower or on no make-up days, as I didn't like how my makeup applied with it on underneath. Overall, I would say it's a good product, but I wouldn't make it one of my go-to's."

I have been using this for well over a month now and I have really been able to see a noticeable difference in fine lines and crows feet. It has minimized those laugh lines in the corner of the eyes when I smile. I do feel like after using this i can observe that the skin under my eyes is not quite as thin, it seems to improve the elasticity of the skin directly underneath the eye. Although I have never had much of a problem with under eye bags or dark skin, it does seem to improve the look of the skin when I put it on in the morning. I notice some definite decrease in puffiness. The product itself comes in an elegant little pot with a gold lid. It is much thicker than a lot of eye creams I have used in the past. It has a lovely, clean smell to it that is not overpowering in the least, nor does it stick around long, which is nice for me because I suffer from migraines, and too much of a perfumey fragrance can really be a trigger. As I mentioned previously, the consistency of this cream is rather thick and creamy and I discovered that it will leave a bit of an oily residue on the skin that lasts for about an hour or so after application. It does not seem to affect the staying power of any makeup you might put on after using the product. The oily residue I noticed also has not caused any problems with acne or skin discomfort of any sort. I have experienced nothing but positive effects from using this product. I would highly rate it as one of the best eye creams I have ever used."

It was also a long lasting hydration that wouldn't go away for hours. I also love the way it keeps my under eyes and lids smooth when I apply makeup. I have been using it more at night and have noticed a huge difference in the morning when I am doing my morning routine. It has helped my eye area stay hydrated and that can also help prevent wrinkles. I suffer from extremely dry skin and not much works when it comes to hydrating and moisturizing my skin. So this has been really helpful in my skin care routine and I would love it if they had a moisturizer for face and body with this same hydrating technique I would definitely buy it.

I don't have noticeable wrinkles under my eyes, but I am starting to see some crow's feet when I smile. I have a small dark spot under my right eye that usually responds well to vitamin C.   I've used this during my a.m. and p.m. skincare routine as my last step. I dab a tiny amount with my ring finger and gently pat under my undereye and around the eyebone. It left my undereye skin feeling hydrated and soft from the first use. After using it regularly for several weeks, I see that my skin looks smoother and more supple overall. I haven't seen any lightening of the dark spot, but I understand this product isn't targeting that issue.   The eye cream comes in a heavy, round glass container with a twist-off lid that gives a sense of luxury to it. It's a beige-colored cream with a medium lotion consistency that absorbs quickly in the skin without any greasy residue.   It initially has a strong perfume scent but becomes less noticeable over time. However, my preference would be unscented. The scent makes me think of a body lotion; there's no reason to have it in a cream so close to the eye. Overall, the cream is effective, and I recommend it to others looking for these features. However, I would need something with lightening ingredients for my particular needs."

As a 36 year old with a primary concern of aging around my eyes, this cream has proven itself time and time again as the perfect eye cream to help combat all of those issues and keep my eye area looking youthful.

Color me surprised when I tried it and could actually keep it on without it breaking me out around my eye area, have a migraine, or dry me out even more. It is fragranced but I find it a powdery scent that dissipates once on the skin and isn't overwhelming in the jar. The texture is a thick cream that stays that way, moisturizing yet occlusive. I recommend it at night since I find my mascara and makeup slips off even with light application of said cream. Even though I've only been using it for a few months I can say I've seen some benefits: some of my fine lines have been minimized, dryness has been relieved, and a little texture has been refined. Its definitely not a holy grail since I am not looking for my eye area to look like it did when I was 25 but it helps me to not look so tired."

Overall my eyes appear a bit sunken due to dehydration and insomnia. With cooler weather I tend to get some dry patches. Nothing has really helped.  It does have a strong floral scent at first, but it goes away. I went to the company site to verify how to apply properly, glad I did as I think it helped as it is a more Gua Sha type approach vs tapping the product in.  You do not need a lot of product, otherwise it doesn't absorb quickly and the fragrance may irritate sensitive eyes as a result.  Within a week, the fine crows feet softened and the sunken look diminished. My eyelids appeared smoother. I applied between the eyebrows as directed and the lines there have softened too.  Dark circles are still there, but the left eye (which was less dark) looks lighter. My right eye for awhile seemed darker, but then seemed to have shrunk in size.  It is a very thick cream, again a little goes a long way, so in the summer I could see this being a problem with my combination skin that leans more oily during that season.  It has been 3 weeks and I think my eyes show a big improvement in softness, smoothness, less wrinkles and firmer skin. My hope is with longer use the dark circles will improve.  Tip: the residue on your fingers apply to smile lines, upper lip and/or forehead. This cream helps softened any lines."

I was very excited to try it, it feels great when Iu2019m applying it. It spreads easily, especially for how thick it is. The smell is light and dissipates quickly.   My issue is that it stays on my skin, seemingly until I wash it off. It never fully absorbed. Iu2019d put it on at night and I could still feel it in the morning. If I put it on in the morning, I could still feel it that evening. It made no difference even if I used a very small amount.  I was very disappointed.  If you can stand that feeling itu2019s worth it. I also might be an outlier with this issue. Besides this the product seems great so Iu2019m still giving it 3 stars."

I also tried this on my fiancu00e9 and it worked well on her sensitive skin. I can see this working well for her fine lines. I thankfully donu2019t have any, but it did help with plumping up the skin and brightening it. I would highly recommend this cream to others . Iu2019m a huge fan of Shiseido products, and this has been added to my list of favorites.  This is definitely a new Favorite eye cream for me !"

The first thing I noticed about this Shisheido Benefiance Eye Cream is how very hydrating it is. The consistency is thicker but not too heavy or greasy and a little bit really goes a long way. My under eye area tends to be dry so this has really improved the elasticity and made my skin look and feel more plump. I havenu2019t noticed any major difference with larger wrinkles but my skins texture is less uneven and feels softer around my eyes. With my under eye puffiness, this seemed to help diminish the appearance after using it for a while as well. The scent is there without being overpowering and I havenu2019t noticed any type of irritation after using this. Overall Iu2019m definitely noticing a more youthful appearance around my eyes these days! I highly recommend using this if youu2019re concerned at all about aging eyes or just want to plump up and tighten your skin."

Itu2019s on the thicker side but spreads out easily, almost like a cream/gel hybrid so you only need a dab under each eye. Since I have oily eyelids and this cream tends to take a while to absorb, I only wore it at night and still felt the hydration under my eyes when I woke up. I canu2019t wear it during the day under my makeup because I feel like it will break my concealer apart and make things move around.  There is a fragrance, which I can do without. Itu2019s not overly scented I just donu2019t like the idea of fragrance being too close to my eyes. The packaging is nice, comes with a little spatula to scoop out the product for hygienic purposes but I personally never use them unless thereu2019s a way to store them like on the lid or something (Tatcha has that packaging), otherwise I just throw it out.  The jar itself seems huge. Since I only use this product at night I feel like itu2019ll last me a very long time.   Incredibly thankful to be given this opportunity to test it out. Will definitely continue using for hydration underneath my eyes."

It has a verrrrry subtle fresh scent to it. So subtle, in fact, that I canu2019t actually tell if it is scented or not, but it is a very pleasant smell. The eye cream itself is SO thick and rich. Applying it under and around my eyes felt so smooth, soft, and creamy. I used only a small amount but even that was almost too much. You really only need a tiny amount because of how thick it is. For that reason, I can see this lasting me a very long time, which I really appreciate because you can really get your moneyu2019s worth. After one use it made my eyes feel hydrated and brighter and after continuing to use it I definitely notice my dark circles almost gone completely. I donu2019t have many fine lines around my eye area but I can definitely see it being a good preventative. I also like the range of ingredients which include peptides, squalane, and ginseng extract to cover multiple different concerns. Iu2019ll be using this product till itu2019s very last drop and definitely 10/10 recommend for eye bags, darkness, and wrinkles!"

Iu2019ve been using it for a few weeks now and canu2019t say I notice a huge difference in my eye area. The area under my eyes does appear brighter after using it and could possibly be looking slightly tighter but itu2019s nothing that anybody would notice other than myself. Iu2019m not a huge fan of the smell. It reminds me of a scent that a grandmother would wear. Itu2019s a little too perfumey for me personally. I love the weight of the jar. Itu2019s solid and decently heavy. Appears to be glass. Itu2019s probably a jar that I will end up saving and adding to my craft stash. I did receive this product for free in return for my honest review. But this review is 100% my own honest opinion."

I had been on the hunt for an effective eye cream for quite some time, and my search finally came to an end with the Shiseido Benefiance Wrinkle Smoothing Eye Cream. After almost three weeks of use, I am thrilled with the noticeable improvements it has made to my eye area.  One of the standout features of this eye cream is its light-weight formula. Unlike other eye creams I have tried in the past, this one did not feel heavy or greasy on my skin. It absorbed quickly and effortlessly, leaving no residue behind. As someone with oily skin, this was a major plus for me, as I was able to apply makeup right after without any issues.  The cream has a beautiful and delicate scent that adds to the luxurious experience. It is not overpowering, but rather provides a subtle, pleasant fragrance that enhances the overall application process. Additionally, the packaging is sleek and convenient, making it easy to dispense just the right amount of product each time.  In terms of results, I couldn't be happier. The Skin around my eyes feels hydrated, plump, and smoother than ever before. The fine lines that had started to creep up are visibly reduced, giving my eyes a more youthful appearance. The cream has also tackled my under-eye area, brightening it up and reducing the puffiness I often wake up with.  In conclusion, the Shiseido Benefiance Wrinkle Smoothing Eye Cream is a game-changer for anyone looking to improve the condition of their eyes. With its lightweight, non-greasy formula, delightful scent, and visible results, I am confident in saying that this eye cream is worth every penny. Treat your eyes to this wonderful product and say hello to hydrated, plumper, and more youthful-looking skin."

In one week, I think you can notice a difference so definitely a must have beauty staple to have for those who have and want to prevent wrinkles around the eyes."

I am pleased with the smooth texture, and light feel, but I will say I have not seen a difference in any wrinkle smoothing. This may be because I have some deep crows feet wrinkles already, and I would imagine those will stay..   Overall, I would recommend this product as an eye cream if you need one."

I'm getting older so Iu2019ve been focusing on preventing wrinkles or anything to slow down the aging process. Iu2019m lucky enough to not have a lot of wrinkles around my eyes, however, Iu2019d like to soften the few fine lines I see that are starting to develop.

I donu2019t know if itu2019s supposed to smell like this or if I got a bad batch. This eye cream doesn't absorb too well and will sit on your skin for quite some time. Therefore, itu2019s probably best for nighttime use unless you have super dry skin you'd like moisturized throughout the day. I used this cream every night for 2 weeks and didn't see any difference in my fine lines. This eye cream did not work for me so I wouldnu2019t buy this product as an eye cream alone.

When I entered my 30s and beyond, signs of aging began to appear and were most evident in my eyes such as dark circles, wrinkles and puffiness. In addition to my eyes, there are also tiny white particles appearing in the area around my eyes. It made me lose confidence and worry about how to make those tiny particles disappear. And surprisingly, when I looked back at the photos I took from the first day of using Shiseido eye cream to the 18th day, after only nearly 3 weeks of use, I saw a clear improvement in my eyes. Some of the tiny particles on my right eyelid have completely disappeared, other tiny particles in the under eye area have also become lighter and less numerous. The skin around the eyes and between the eyebrows is also noticeably smoother, pores are no longer obvious. Dark circles around the eyes also fade. I haven't seen a clear effect on removing wrinkles in the eye area, but the other effects of the cream as I mentioned above really surprised me and made me very happy about it. The eye cream has a thick, slightly liquid texture, not too thick, with a gentle rose scent, faint but not strong. The above effects make me love it so much that I will choose it as my indispensable eye cream. Thanks for letting me try and experience how good it is!"

The fine lines have softened and are less noticeable, the skin around my eyes stays hydrated longer.  I have not seen a great reduction in the darkness under my eyes, but that may take a little longer for me.   This cream is super luxurious and glides on skin easily and does not roll up under my concealer.  It only takes a small amount of product to dot around my eye, and it melts into the skin and gives a luminosity to the skin.  I even apply between my eyebrows and the 11 wrinkles that were starting to show have also softened greatly.  I appreciate great skin care and enjoy the results of products that are formulated to solve aging skin concerns.  This cream has powerful anti-aging ingredients along with botanical extracts to synergistically work together for healthier skin.  I can see that over time the fragile skin around my eyes will only get better with continued use of this product.  I have fair skin that can be sensitive to many products, especially around my eyes.  This cream does not irritate my eye area or cause sensitivity.  I would recommend this eye cream to all age groups because everyone will receive a great benefit from this amazing formulation!"

Upon unboxing: The packaging is inarguably luxe. The jar is glass, giving it heft and density. The lid has the Shiseido emblem on it. The cream is a yellowish, pale egg-yolk color. Upon glancing at the ingredients, this is likely from iron oxides. The cream is noticeably fragranced.  Upon first use: A little goes a very long way in terms of moisturizing, which is not surprising considering there are waxes in the ingredient list. The texture reminds me of the Kiehlu2019s avocado eye cream, which I like a lot.  Under makeup, but without concealer: Eyeshadow applied slightly patchy on one eye. I only used the elf halo filter and elf hd setting powder in the eye area prior to eyeshadow application since I was in a hurry. Will try to use and set with powder prior to eyeshadow tomorrow.  Under makeup, with concealer: after allowing time to set in between applying eye cream and makeup, set much better and eyeshadow didnu2019t feel as patchy. I used the tarte shape tape concealer and the elf hd setting powder to set the eye area.   After using twice a day for over a week: I have a visible vein under my eye that is far less noticeable than before using the eye cream. This is incredibly impressive given the continuous sleep deprivation Iu2019ve been through as a new mom. I donu2019t truly have major complaints with my eye area (like severe dark circles), so this eye cream for me is primarily for wrinkle prevention. In terms of performance though, I am impressed it could lighten the darkness under my eye by that much! Plus, there are loads of actives and herbals in this cream that make it a skincare powerhouse. The fragrance definitely makes this feel like a luxury pampering skincare product every time I use it, and itu2019s very enjoyable.  Would I buy it: Not right now for myself, given inflation, since this is a splu"

It is formulated with a blend of ingredients that work together to hydrate, plump, and firm the skin. And it works!!!!!!  Key ingredients include: ReNeura Technology+TM, KOMBU-Bounce Complex, Hyaluronic acid and Collagen. Shiseido Benefiance cream has a rich, velvety texture that spreads easily on the skin. It absorbs quickly and leaves no greasy residue. The cream has a light, pleasant scent that is not overpowering. I also applied eye makeup over it and it didnu2019t slip off or didnu2019t make it look goopy. Overall, I highly recommend Shiseido Benefiance Wrinkle Smoothing Cream to anyone looking for an effective anti-aging moisturizer. It is a bit on the expensive side, but it is worth the investment. I am a fan!!!"
