I have dry to combination skin and it helps me feel hydrated during the winters. I like how i use twice a day and still does not feel greasy. I tried the mini sleeping mask, and when I wake up the next day morning, my skin feels very fresh and and does not feel sticky. Overall i love the complete set and it makes me stay fresh."

			"review_text": "Just got my hands on the Laneige Strong Barrier Minis Set, and itâ€™s a hydration lifesaver! If your skinâ€™s feeling dried out and needs a little extra care, this set has everything to bring it back to life. Inside are two bottles of the Cream Skin Toner & Moisturizer, the Water Bank Hyaluronic Cream Moisturizer, and the Water Sleeping Mask. With these, I know Iâ€™m set for a while: theyâ€™re like a hydration powerhouse lineup! My routine starts with the Cream Skin Toner & Moisturizer right after cleansing. Itâ€™s a milky, lightweight texture that just melts into my skin, setting up the perfect base for the next step. Next, I go in with the Water Bank Cream. I was expecting a lotion, but itâ€™s more like a rich, creamy texture that forms a soft barrier over my skin. It feels so nourishing and protective, which is exactly what my skin craves! Finally, the Water Sleeping Mask is my last step to seal everything in. This mask is so gentle and gives an extra boost of hydration that I can leave on overnight. Iâ€™ll be using it a couple of times a week to keep that hydration locked in. The morning after, my skin feels noticeably plumper and super soft! This set is a winter must-have for anyone looking to keep their skin happy, hydrated, and smooth. Laneige has really nailed it with this combo with all the essentials for bringing back that soft, bouncy skin. Highly recommend giving it a try!"
