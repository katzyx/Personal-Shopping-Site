The product is easy to apply and the packaging is luxurious. It has a light scent and doesn’t irritate my sensitive skin and scalp. Month one I didn’t see much difference to my hair, month two I felt that my hair was growing faster and longer in a shorter amount of time. Month 3 I saw length progress as well. Unfortunately I didn’t notice a difference in the density of my hair, I felt like there were still sparse areas lacking in hair. I also noticed by month three I had many shorter hairs, whether that was hair growth or breakage was hard to decifer. I have very fine oily hair so it’s quite noticeable. I do love that this product is fair trade, cruelty free, and plant based. See pictures for results."

This product is supposed to help promote hair growth. I have been having an issue with losing a lot of hair lately, so I was excited to try out this product.  I think I will have to use this product longer to see if it really helps with regrowing my hair. This product did not cause any allergic reaction or itching. The consistency of the product was good. The three things I didn’t like about it was the dropper did not fill up completely, it only filled up half way. The product never really seemed to cover all of my scalp. Also, it made my hair feel greasy.  Overall, it was an ok product but it does have some issues. I would like to see how my hair growth improves in the next year."

While using this serum I realized I could go 3-4 days without washing my hair. I think overall the health of my hair definitely improved. If you have funds to spend I would definitely try this serum."

One thing I noticed is that GRO+ has a more subtle scent compared to the original (I loved the original's fragrance, don’t get me wrong, but GRO+ has a more feminine touch if that matters to you). The GRO+ formula is just as effective—it doesn't weigh your hair down and applies like water. I focus it on my thinning areas, specifically my front bangs and the top of my scalp. For best results, I apply it to air-dried hair at night. I've only been using it for a few weeks, so I haven’t seen significant baby hairs yet, but I'm enjoying it as much as the original."

I can see the new growth coming in. While I have to deal with the new growth as it grows, I don’t mind it at all! My scalp tends to be greasy so I was hesitant. I didn’t want this ‘serum’ to make it even more oily. It was not what I expected at all. This product has zero oil. I applied it at night just before bed because I style my hair in the morning.

			"review_text": "The Grow Plus Advanced Hair Serum from Vegamour is nothing short of phenomenal. I absolutely adore it for its incredibly lightweight formula, which ensures that neither my scalp nor my hair becomes greasy. This is a huge plus for me as it allows me to go longer between washes. Additionally, the serum is unscented, so it won’t clash with any other hair products or leave any unpleasant odors in your hair.  I've been using this serum for just over a week now, around 14 days, and I've already started to see some baby hairs sprouting on my forehead. This is a significant improvement, and I'm thrilled with the results. I've also been using the matching conditioner and shampoo, which I believe has contributed to these early signs of new hair growth. However, the serum itself is undoubtedly effective, as evidenced by the baby hairs I've noticed.  For those looking to accelerate results, using a derma roller on the scalp in conjunction with this serum can make a noticeable difference. This is likely why I'm seeing new growth so quickly. Additionally, incorporating a red therapy brush into my routine has also been beneficial.  One of the standout features of this serum is its lightweight nature. Unlike another hair serum I previously used, which left my scalp greasy and forced me to wash my hair more frequently, this serum leaves my hair and scalp feeling fresh and clean.   I highly recommend the Grow Plus Advanced Hair Serum if you're looking to promote hair growth. As someone who is 10 months postpartum and still experiencing hair loss, this serum has been a game-changer in helping to restore some of the hair I've lost. Overall, I would give this product a glowing 5-star rating."

I was excited to use this product because I have always had shoulder length,fine,thin hair. To make matters worse my hair is shedding/thinning more. The product packaging is very nice and it looks upscale & luxurious. The dropper applicator gives you precisely the desired amount. What I also really like is that this product is cruelty-free,100% vegan,gluten-free,toxin-free & phthalate-free. There is the slightest hint of a chemical-like smell, but it was not bothersome to me. When I was using the first bottle I had to remove the plastic insert from the bottle to use the remaining product.Not a big deal, as it is easy to remove. The serum is light-weight and not sticky or oily at all.   The past three months I have included The Vegamour GRO+ Advanced Hair serum as part of my nighttime self-care routine. What is great about this product is that you can use it on wet or dry hair. You don't have to worry about your hair feeling oily. No oily worries with this product. I do not have any bald patches, just an overall thinning of hair. During the first month I was a bit over zealous with the use of the product. I applied it all over my head!I used a soft scalp massager to gently massage the product evenly throughout my scalp.Needless to say,I used up the first month rather quickly. The second month, I tapered my use a bit and didn't use as much of the product I forgot to use the scalp serum maybe 7 days at the most during the three  month period.  Serum placement was focused around the perimeter edges of my hairline primarily and periodically in the crown and nape. With this product it is certainly about being consistent and taking photos along the way. It wasn't until I started gathering photos to edit that I could see improvement in my hair density. The proof is in the photos! I know that with continued use I can expe"

The very first indication the was a problem was when my scalp started to become less tolerant of the heat from a blow dryer becoming easily and quickly burned when styling.  I have been diligently adhering to a 90 day trial of Vegamour Gro+ Advanced Hair Serum.  I applied the liquid daily on dry hair.  It super easy to apply,  just a dropperful distributed into the scalp daily. There is no odor, no stickiness and no oilyness.  I was able to style my hair as usual, using my regular styling products.  I had very high hopes as I imagine most do when embarking on a hair issue solution.  Regretfully I did not find the success I was looking for.  I had absolutely no new growth but I did notice the shedding slowed down.  The results for me are not enough to continue to pursue this treatment, for me it's just a matter of genetics."

After about 6 weeks of consistent use, I began to notice a decrease in hair shedding and an increase in the thickness and fullness of my hair. I also noticed that my hair was growing faster than usual.  The results were gradual but noticeable. While I didn't experience a dramatic regrowth of lost hair, I was pleased with the overall improvement in my hair's health and appearance.  **Additional Observations:**  * The serum is vegan, cruelty-free, and free from sulfates, parabens, and dyes. * It contains a blend of clinically proven ingredients, including mung bean extract, red clover extract, and biotin. * The bottle contains 30 mL of serum, which lasted me for about 3 months with regular use.  **Conclusion:**  The Vegamour GRO+ Advanced Hair Serum is an easy-to-use and effective hair growth serum. It has helped to reduce hair loss, improve hair thickness and fullness, and promote faster hair growth. While it may not be a miracle cure for hair loss, it is a promising option for anyone looking to improve the health and appearance of their hair."

Look no further than the Vegamour GRO+ Advanced Hair Serum. As someone who has battled thinning hair for years, I can confidently say this product is a game-changer.  From the moment I started using Vegamour GRO+, I noticed a significant reduction in hair shedding within just a few weeks. The serum's blend of clinically proven ingredients like Red Clover Extract and mung bean helps nourish and strengthen hair follicles, promoting healthier, thicker hair growth.  What impressed me most was the serum's lightweight texture and non-greasy formula, making it easy to incorporate into my daily routine without any hassle. Unlike other products I've tried, Vegamour GRO+ didn't weigh down my hair or leave any residue, which is crucial for someone with fine hair like mine.  After using it consistently for two months, I saw a noticeable improvement in the volume and thickness of my hair. My scalp felt healthier, and I even noticed new growth in areas where my hair had been thinning the most. It's truly been a confidence booster to see my hair looking fuller and more vibrant.  If you're hesitant about trying yet another hair product, I understand. I've been there. But let me assure you, Vegamour GRO+ Advanced Hair Serum is worth every penny.

My hair feels the same as before, so while it wasn’t a game-changer for me, it also wasn’t harmful. Overall, it’s a decent product, but I wouldn’t count on it for dramatic results."

This time I started using this treatment everyday since I gave birth and now 3 months later not only did I not lose the hair like I did last time, but I actually feel like my hair line is fuller and over all healthier! My hair feels strong and so much less falls out when I brush my hair, I would normally get a brush full of hair after I washed it and now only a few strands! I also love that it’s lightweight and I can apply it to wet or dry hair without it ruining the appearance of my hair when I style it! LOVE!!"
