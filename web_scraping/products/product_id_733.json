			"review_text": "I LOVE this set, my skin has noticeably cleared up. The only thing that I personally havent really used is the moisturizer since the one Im currently using is perfect for my skin but everything else is super great. Ive seen lots of reviews talking about the green serums brownish color and I just wanted to say that i've bought the full size of it before and it was like that. Since its a clean brand the color isn't going to be and/or stay a bright green color. I highly recommend this set as someone with acne prone combination skin, its worth it."

			"review_text": "Upon receiving my kit I was pleasantly surprised by the packaging and the size of the products. All of the pumps worked well and the product dispensed nicely. On my first use I did notice that there was a brown hue to the Green Machine serum. I read others had experienced this as well but personally wasnt satisfied with my purchase so contacted Sephora for a return. However, my second Green Machine was the same color. I then contacted InBeauty and they assured me that the color change was solely due to the natural ingridients that the product is made with and it is safe to use and assured me I will still see the same results.   Overall I am happy with my purchase. Nice packaging, good size and I believe the amount of product needed per use it minimal so this should last sometime. What I am unhappy about it the color of the product and the extent of work I had to go to in order to find out if this was normal. I would kindly suggest that a note be made in the description or packagaing that oxidiaztion can occur."

			"review_text": "This is the second time I’ve purchased this kit! It’s a great deal for sure. I love slushy as a lightweight moisturizer for the warmer months. It’s smoothing and reallt makes my skin juicy, so I also use it as a serum in the winter.  I was SO surprised by how much I love the 10+10 moisturizer. It’s my favorite to travel with and looks great under makeup and mineral spf. I’m quite sensitive to vitamin c and can’t use a lot of formulas because of it, but this doesn’t irritate my skin at all. It’s great to get vitamin c and peptides and my moisturizer in one go.  I don’t love the cleanser as I find it drying but it works for travel. Green machine doesn’t irritate my skin at all either and is a great antioxidant serum.  The stars here are the moisturizers tho so a great deal.  I have acne prone and combo-oily skin. I do prioritize anti-aging as well."
