I'm not sure if it's just this particular shade (Corrupt) because it's considered metallic, but it is so soft that I am needing to sharpen it every other use. Because of this, the pencil is already at the halfway mark and I've been only using it for slightly over a month. Also, because it's so soft, my regular sharpener would eat it up and sharpening it was near impossible. I switched to the NARS eye sharpener which has made a difference but not enough to purchase this eyeliner again. Disappointing at $30."

As either cat eye or puppy eye style. 3] there's something about the texture and true depth of this particular black. Not all UD pencils are like this as Demolition has such little pigmentation and waxier texture."

The eyeliner used to go on smoothly, soft and stay put, waterproof all day and night. Now, the pencil breaks OFTEN, when you sharpen it with Urban Decay sharpener, the pencil breaks INSIDE the sharpener and you have to throw it away because it's unusable afterwards. This has happened now 8 times, which means I have wasted hundreds of dollars in these pencils and tons of time trying to fix it. I purchased three eyeliners, thinking the first one was just defective, but all three were the same. I even bought different sharpeners and the same thing keeps happening. The pencil color hides and the casing is hallow and when you try to sharpen, it breaks off and/or sharpens to the point that it scratches your eyelid or cuts your finger. It's a massive ripoff and sadly a product that used to be good is now not nearly as good as a dollar store item. This brand should be ashamed to sell this product. Read the non incentivized reviews for the truth. I am switching brands finally, and I should have done this sooner..."

This happens often, and I feel gipped that I spend money, and half or more of the product is useless. Urban Decay hasn't found a way to fix this over the years....not to mention it's unsafe when sharpened. The edges are not smooth, and you risk scratching/poking your eye or skin.

I got the shade Rockstar Wich is supposed to be a matte dark purple. Well it's metallic. It's dark so it may be hard to see but it's definitely not a matte shade.

This color is beautiful with warm neutral shadows (browns, adobe shades, orangey-tans, ect). Ease of sharpening: great! Isn't so soft that it breaks off when sharpening. Sturdy pencil. Water Resistance: once it's on, it's ON. In terms of water line - you'll probably have to touch up from time to time, but what do you expect? Your waterline is supposed to stay moist for the health of your eyes and a foreign substance is likely to diminish throughout the day as a result. Keep the pencil in your purse if that's a priority.  Overall this is a great product to add to your makeup kit if you're looking for strong pigments, great application, and beautiful range of colors! I'm definitely going to invest in more shades."

Very creamy and easy to use, glides nicely on the eye, would recommend that since it's so creamy to pat away oil from the eyelid before applying and to use a setting spray, as while it does not bleed or fade at all even after hours, it can be easily wiped away or smudged if you tend to get oily. Great for lining water lines. One of the blackest pencil liners available, great for the price as they don't dry up even after a while"

Just a tip that it's so creamy, you should made sure to pay away any oil from your eyelids before using, and while it has great staying power and does not budge or fade all night, I would also recommend a setting spray as it can be easily wiped away by accident if you apply it more thickly for greater pigmentation. I have found this Alkaline colour to be very sexy and sultry on brown skin if you want something less harsh and more doe eyed than black, I love to use it in a thick line while using a liquid black liner tighter to my lashes"

Even though it's water proof it washes off easily.  I have not tried to sharpen it yet so will see if that is easy to do. Some complained it didn't sharpen well."
