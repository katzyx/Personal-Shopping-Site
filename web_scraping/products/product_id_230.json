			"review_text": "If you love a good body sheen without glitter or the oily mess of some body oils, this is the one for you. there's not much of a scent so you can use your perfumes as needed as well. I put this all over my arms and chest, and my legs if I'm wearing a short skirt or shorts and it makes my whole body look so glowy. I get people commenting on it all the time. it makes my skin feel nice and hydrated too, and it doesn't catch on any dry patches I may have. it also makes me feel luxurious."

			"review_text": "I like the subtle glow- but it’s nothing special. Pretty expensive for how much you get. There is no scent at all so it just smells a bit waxy and meh. I was hoping it had a coconutty scent. I think there are other products like this one for less."
