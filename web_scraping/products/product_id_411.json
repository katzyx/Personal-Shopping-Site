I believe if you don't have excessive acne or oily skin this helps to keep you moisturized and does show results with continuous use. I find using both products together gives the best result for myself personally. I would recommend this if you're looking to moisturize, add a glow and clear up any minor acne or areas that you would frequently get breakouts."

Little did I know, my old one isn’t compatible with a refill, and I spent a lot of time prying the old pod out just for the new one to fit in, but the green top won’t screw back on because it wasn’t designed to.

Due to its formula, I feel comfortable layering it with other serums for my night time routine. It does NOT break me out, it helps reduce of redness & dry skin, plus it works very well with other serums (retinol, glycolic acid, etc.). My skin feels soft, not overly hydrated & just overall wonderful. The biggest plus is that it will not cause breakouts for me. Not the biggest fan of the refillable packaging (sorry!) but this product is one of my holy grails."

This was terrible. The cream consistency was fine. But as the day progressed, my skin became increasingly oily. After an entire bottle, my skin was irritated and covered in pimples. I felt like a 13 year old girl all over again. My makeup (which I wear less and less since focusing on skincare) sat like cake frosting on my face. It was uncomfortable. I would not recommend this to anyone with normal to oily skin. I think this may be a great option for someone who lives in very dry, cold weather as a RESCUE night cream. It is deceivingly heavy for the consistency. I did not purchase again."

			"review_text": "I cannot stress this enough- this is hands down THE BEST moisturizer I have ever used, I wish I could bold and highlight and gold star this. I’ve used this for like 3 years at this point, and I loved it so much but it’s expensive so I went on the hunt for dupes. The closest dupe is Inkey list, and it does not even hold a candle to this magnificent substance. I used to have oily skin and it was the only product that did not make me look shiny. Then I had cancer, went through chemo and this was THE ONLY PRODUCT of my skincare routine that I could still use (due to my changing skin needs and sensitivity at the time). Now, after cancer, my skin is dry and it’s the only product, again, that is perfect for my dry skin, but doesn’t make me feel or look like a grease, and gives me all the hydration I need. It is unscented, light weight, and must have some sort of magic in it. I buy a big tub maybe once or twice a year, because you need maybe a quarter pump to fully coat your face. I did the math, and it was more expensive for me to putz around with other moisturizers than to just splurge 2x a year on this and my skin thanks me greatly. If you have “problem” skin of honestly any kind, this is the best thing to use. I would like a commission from DE for how often and frequently I get people hooked on this. Thank you for listening to my Ted talk, and you’re welcome."

			"review_text": "I've been using this cream for years and years and loved it so much, I'd always repurchase. Even with the price hikes as well as introduction of the refill packaging,  I continued to use it because this was my staple daily moisturizer. Never had too much trouble with refills/ packaging, but what I did have trouble with recently is the last time I repurchased the refill, my skin started turning red and burning. It never happened before so I thought maybe it's something else in my beauty routine. After a while I decided to test my theory and stopped using it all together. Used another moisturizer for a month. Then came back to this one. Sure enough, as soon as I started using it again, my skin started burning again. And not a mild burning sensation that goes away, but actual skin irritation. To me this is crazy that Drunk Elephant never mentioned any reformulations to the formula, but it is clear that the ingredients changed. So many other people are mentioning the same thing, seems to me this is not a coincidence. Also as a side note - the overall silence/ lack of education about their products for all of the tweens and younger people that keep buying those products and leaving reviews about damaged skin, is alarming to say the least. Be better! It's not that hard to be transparent and release a video on social media to make sure kids don't go and buy this stuff!"

I have pretty dry skin and this product alone makes my skin feel so good! it instantly hydrates my skin to the point where it looks dewy, glowy, soft, and even plump! it's honestly the best product i've ever purchased (along with the protini polypeptide serum). i highly doubt i will ever buy a different moisturizer again- i'm pretty much married  to this one. if you can stomach the price, i think you'll find you'll be really happy with your purchase overall.   the packaging is pretty garbage overall, because once you run low or out, it's really difficult to crack the top open and get whatever is left inside."

Did nothing for texture around my mouth but the consistency and hydration was the closest of all. FIB Ultra Repair - hydration and healing but nothing else for aging. YOUTH TO THE PEOPLE Superberry Hydrate and Glow, I love this as a night cream but way too sticky for day use. LANEIGE Toner & Moisturizer w/ Ceramides and Peptides, okay but not pluming and did nothing for aging.  All this to say…I used a sample of the DE again and it was like HEAVEN.

It feels lightweight, yet packs more moisture than the Caudelie vinosource sorbet I was using at the time (which left me feeling a bit too dry). And more importantly, it doesn't contain any gluten, corn, or oat, none of which I can tolerate on my skin.  It has never once made me break out, made me turn red, or given me a rash, and although I was doubtful for the first year, yes, I believe this product has kept my face firm and plump for the 6 years I've been using it. It's great for a daytime moisturizer (I use marula oil and/or f-balm at night), and in the winter I can easily combine this with a couple of drops of marula oil so it keeps my skin protected in the dry air.  I haven't figured out yet how to use the refillable containers without wasting a ton of product when swapping refills, but maybe one day I'll get there. 😅"

Yes, it is expensive, but compared to other expensive skin care products, there's a good amount of peptides and amino acids for the price you pay. It is definitely not a cream that will transform your skin overnight, but the growth factors in it would provide anti-aging and support to the skin on the long run. For reference, I'm 27 with acne-pro skin that also tends to be dehydrated as I use actives in my skincare. No clogged pores or pimples with this product, however it wasn't rich enough and irritated my skin. Keep in mind that this moisturizer has a PH of 4, which is quite low and acidic. On some days when my skin was already sensitive due to actives, this moisturizer literally burnt me. So unfortunately it is not a product for me, but it may work for someone else. If that works for you, I would say that it is a good product."

Ever since, everyday I wake up with better skin. Even after going to the dermatologist, noting worked. I will have to see if my skin goes back to being bad once this runs out, which will determine f I repurchase. I am a teen and everyone says this product is too strong but on their website it says it’s fine for tweens and Ages up. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of five is because it is extremely overpriced. I’m not a fan of the formula but I love the results so I will keep using it. Personally the only reason I use it is for the results but if it wasn’t working good on my skin, this product is not worth it. Comparing to the other reviews,  they all think it is a bit overarex and overpriced. It is up to you if you purchase it. I suggest trying the sample size but give it time and be consistent for results to show up."

During those 2 yrs I tried other products a few times due to how expensive this is. But I always came back. Now, with that said, it didn't perform miracles! I still have wrinkles! But it has helped tremendously & can tell when I haven't been using it! So that price is definitely worth it for me. I do use other products with this. At night-Sunday Riley A+ retinoid, Luna night oil. Daytime- Sunday Riley Good Genes & switch it up with The Ordinary Lactic acid, and also use TO Pycnogenol. I don't see me changing any time soon. The price though..... Its a bit much! I've seen so many young girls reaching for this & IMO this is not for teens! This is for someone older. But do you....."

After hearing rave reviews, I was completely underwhelmed and returned after about 3 weeks.   I have very dry, sensitive skin. I have been using Elf's Superhydrate moisturizer for the last few years and I love that stuff; I started to use it when my skin was freaking out with perioral dermatitis, acne, etc. and it helped everything level out and has maintained my skin ever since. However, it is very basic and I am at the point I want to find something more than just maintenance. My goals:  - deeply moisturize and make my skin glow - DON'T TRIGGER MY PERIORAL DERMATITIS - don't cause a break out (I also have acne prone skin) - hydrate my fine lines and acne scars to make them less visible - help with anti-aging  while this product didn't trigger my perioral dermatitis (a big plus; it's extremely reactive so that's no small feat) or cause a break out, it left my skin feeling tight and unmoisturized. I thought at first I hadn't put enough on, so I tried layering two, three times, but that didn't change anything. It also felt what can best be described as gritty on my face, and I found it actually settled into my fine lines/scars and made them more noticeable.   After about two weeks I messed around and decided to treat it kind of like a serum. I put on one layer and then layered my usual Superhydrate moisturizer on top, and I found in that scenario my skin feel more moisturized than just the Superhydrate on it's own. However it certainly didn't do enough to justify the price point, especially if I would just have to layer my usual moisturizer on top anyways just to notice a slight difference. I also found it still settled into my fine lines. After a few days of that, I decided to give up and make the return. I'm currently trying the Lala Retro™ Nourishing Whipped instead, and although it's only been a few days, I have been seeing more success with that."

However after letting that dry down and applying the moisturizer on top, the products didn’t blend well- not pilling as much as separating into a white lather like another reviewer mentioned. I like them individually, but they are not great to layer as they appear to be marketed. Could better to take the “smoothie” approach here."

I'd vaguely seen Drunk Elephant products in passing on the internet but they're clearly aimed at people who are younger but financially illiterate and don't demand anything from their skincare but eco friendly packaging and a laughably high price point for uncomfortable, sticky moisturizer that doesn't do much but sit on the skin. Because tiktok told them to buy it. I was shocked to learn It's sold for $22. The deluxe sample size, for a whopping 15ml. As I found that out, I was using it on my legs because it's simply not high quality enough to go on my face, and the alternative was the trash.  Really overpriced, absolutely mediocre face cream. When you apply it, it just feels like a drugstore night cream. Not particularly light or heavy. It doesn't melt into skin particularly well. It gave me a few CCs after one use, as many others reported, but that's not the reason I gave it one star. If it hadn't produced any negative effects like acne, it would still earn 1 star. It doesn't feel particularly nice when applied nor does it melt into skin particularly well or without residue, which is ridiculous for the luxury price point. For slightly more, you can purchase the Tatcha dewy skin cream, Pai's Anthemis (that's even less expensive IIRC), or similar, which are luxurious to apply and produce truly great results in the morning, better than a drugstore moisturizer. This is the price or idiotic 20 year old kids buying everything they see an influencer hawk on tiktok. Slap a label with a hippy-dippy name like drunk elephant, put drugstore brands in plastic, pastel, muted packaging that looks like it came out of a dystopian drama, and charge $68 for 1.6 ounces, and credit-illiterate Gen-Zers will buy it."

Because of the way the product is dispensed, you essentially must smear it across the top to pick it up, and that leaves for a top that's always kinda messy. I wish it was a pump dispenser.

I first got this DE offering in a sample size and as I loved the moisturizing effects, I went out and purchased the full size product. This is one of those moisturizers that ticks a lot of boxes for me...I love the ingredients in here, the innovative packaging that you don't have to dip your fingers into and above all the product itself. Initially this feels quite creamy and rich but sinks effortlessly into my skin and absorbs right in, leaving it thoroughly moisturized and yet matte too (I use one pump of it every AM & PM). I'm prone to oiliness, especially in my t-zone and although it doesn't control (or claim to) the oil, it is one of very few moisturizers that I've used which doesn't aggravate the situation either. Yes it is pricey but not overly so like La Mer or La Prairie - most of whose products don't achieve half of what this does. My skin looks healthier, better and just overall improved.

Using this only at night, it lasted me for about 14 months!  It did not clog my pores, and it provided a light to medium moisture.  Personally, I loved that it was not heavy on chemical exfoliants (like AHA, HLA, etc.), because I want my moisturizer to be just a moisturizer, and if I want to exfoliate, I wish to do that separately.  I don't want to exfoliate every night while I sleep.  Additionally, exfoliants cause my eyebrows to fall out.  Sadly, this moisturizer does contain a small amount of something with exfoliating properties, so the search continues for a noncomedogenic moisturizer with zero exfoliating ingredients.  If anyone knows of one, please let me know!!! I also love that this is made in the USA!"

I’m a 90s baby and a creature of habit who does not like deviating from what works for me. For something to enter my routine and stay there it has to be amazing.  The container is cool I like not having to dip my fingers into a jar but if you breakout easily this is not the cream for you. It’s heavy and kind of sits on the skin too long for my liking. Read through all the reviews, sample it if you can before you take the plunge because you saw this on Tiktok. It is a lovely cream just not for everyone and unfortunately not wowing me enough to become a staple."

This moisturizer didn’t break me out but also did not seem very hydrating. I had to use a nighttime mask frequently when using this product, when I don’t have to do that with other brands. It also didn’t seem to help with any redness or uneven skin tone - didn’t make anything worse, but also didn’t seem to do anything to noticeably improve it.

The Protini™ Polypeptide Firming Moisturizer comes in a sleek and stylish airless pump bottle, which is not only aesthetically pleasing but also practical for keeping the product fresh and free from contamination.  The texture of this moisturizer is light and fluffy, making it easy to apply and absorb quickly into the skin. It contains a blend of nine signal peptides, pygmy waterlily stem cell extract, and soybean folic acid ferment extract, which are all known for their skin firming and hydrating properties. It is also free from ingredients like silicones, essential oils, fragrance, and dyes, making it suitable for all skin types, including sensitive skin. I would definitely buy tyhis product again!"

It doesn’t have a strong scent and the packaging is great for controlling the amount of product you use. My skin has felt really hydrated and smooth lately.  This product was gifted by drunk elephant ecomm"

Does not make my skin feel sticky or heavy.  I did notice I sweat way more after applying it (before a workout) though. Other than that I like this moisturizer!"
