Every product manages to tangle and dry out my hair. I used this product  product and attempted to finger detangle my hair and my hair was a tangled mess. The prior week I had the same issue and thought maybe my hair was just tangled but it was literally coming out in globs. I tried to give the product another try, being even more gentle. Washing my hair in braids, sectioning my hair to apply the conditioner and again a tangled mess. Hair coming out. I immediately grabbed a cheap inexpensive conditioner and the tangles immediately improved. Returning everything from this line"

This doesn't have much slip, which sucks when I'm trying to brush my hair in the shower, but it's good enough. It also doesn't have quite as much hydration as I need, but if your hair isn't super dry, then I think it would be okay! The best part of this product is for sure the scent, the palo santo smells amazing. It is pricey, but you get quite a bit of product, which I really appreciate! Overall , not great for my hair, but i think it's a nice product!"

I come from a mixed background and the rest of my family had stick straight hair so they never knew how to care for my hair. It led to a lifetime of frustration and tears over the frizzy mess on my head.   Now at 45 I know it's because my hair has curls and needs special care. Enter this amazingly thick and moisturizing conditioner. It makes those curls bounce. It isn't sticky. It leaves no residue just a nice slip. And can we talk about how sexy that scent is. Perfectly unisex in my opinion. I love this conditioner and it's now part of my routine. Even my man noticed the scent and complimented it and he don't notice anything like that."

My hair was very dry, and the curls were flat, and losing definition, but one wash with this and I could see immediate results, the definition in my curls was revived. I later tried it with the hydrating shampoo (which worked even better, but that's a different review), and as long as I get this result I'm going to keep buying. I chose medium because I didn't want it to be too heavy, and I think that was the right call. I love the way it feels, and I like the way it smells. I don't know if anyone will care, but to me it smells like unripened banana, which is so specific, but I think if you know what it's like to peel a banana like that, the smell that comes from the peel, it's exactly that. I like it, and I thought I'd pass that along, since the smell does stick in your hair. Tl;dr 10/10, strongly recommend for curly hair that needs more definition and hydration!"

I have fine, dry hair with highlights, and this medium condition is working well so far. It's hydrating without being greasy. I choose not to fully rinse out my conditioner, and I've been happy with the result. Maybe I'll try the Pattern leave-in conditioner, too! I prefer hair products with minimum scent that come in a tube rather than in a pump or bottle, so I'm super satisfied. I paired this with the hydrating shampoo, and it's been a great combo so far."

This is the first product ever where I did not have to put any styler in my hair.... and I live in Florida and work a block from the beach!

The first time I used it was nice, but it quickly went downhill from there. My hair got very dry, brittle, lost all of its curl pattern, and became so stiff I was even just afraid to touch it for fear it would break. Only used the product for two weeks! Save your money, and protect your hair, and buy something else!"
