I couldn’t tell if it was damage or if I suddenly forgot how to wash my hair. The only explanation is this shampoo. I also see broken strands and thinning. I can’t 100% guarantee this shampoo is the cause but the more I research and read about it, I think it is."

I don’t think I used it long enough to experience the hair loss other people are experiencing but it made my hair feel terrible I don’t want to use it anymore. When I used another shampoo my hair felt normal again. I’m not sure if you need to have more texture in your hair or what because this formula is very rich and heavy on the hair."

I use nos.1 and 2 when coloring hair and no.3 (not as much s as I want to because it’s a pain to use) as maintenance. I use different brands of conditioner, mask, leave-in, treatment, stylers, oil, etc. I have tons of hair products."

But I love it because my hair is thick and it needs something to weigh it down. This shampoo also is one of the rare shampoos that doesn’t use sulfate OR salt, so if you get keratins, this is a must, because most shampoos contain salt and that strips your keratin. This shampoo also lathers nicely despite not using sulfates or salt, which I have had difficulty finding among shampoos that don’t use sulfates or salt. So, I highly recommend using this if your hair is thick, frizzy, dry, keratined and color treated like mine"

This one does just that and doesn’t weigh my hair down at all. This shampoo is unique because of its repairing and strengthening properties that work to protect damaged hair. I've noticed less breakage and hair fall since incorporating it into my routine. I also have to comment on the scent of it, which is just lovely, but not overpowering. It’s creamy and citrusy."

			"review_text": "I’ve heard a lot of hype about Olaplex (both bad and good), but never gave it a try myself until recently. I used the No. 4 Bond Maintenance Shampoo in conjunction with the No. 5 conditioner. I was a bit wary given all the news about hair loss, but am happy to note that I didn’t notice anything abnormal while using this – I experienced the same level of shedding as I usually do and really didn’t notice anything of note as compared to other shampoos that I regularly use. The ingredients list is large – there's no way around that – it's massive, but contains some natural ingredients (banana fruit extract, rosemary leaf extract, sunflower seed oil, etc.) as well as biotin, panthenol, and glycerin. I found that it lathered the same as any other sulfate-free shampoo and rinsed out easily. I felt comfortable using it on coloured hair and didn’t notice any stripping or fading. My goal was to see my hair look a bit more rejuvenated. Recently, it has been dry and dull, with a lot of split ends and heat damage. My hair is just naturally on the drier end and prone to frizz, simply the way it’s always been and likely genetics. I also do heat-style my hair 1-2x a week, which doesn’t help the situation. After using this consistently along with the No. 5 conditioner, my hair felt softer to the touch and appeared to be shinier (and as a result, healthier). It didn’t magically “heal” my split ends, but it softened the look of them and made my hair look more cohesive, rather than looking like a bunch of distinct, ratty strands. I don’t know if the difference was dramatic enough to justify the high price point of this shampoo, but it’s a very nice luxury to treat your hair to occasionally. A small amount does go a long way, so it may be more justifiable to splurge on a bottle."

Before using Olaplex Shampoo, my hair felt lackluster and brittle, with split ends making regular appearances. However, after incorporating this miraculous shampoo into my routine, the transformation has been astounding. Not only has Olaplex shampoo restored vitality to my locks, but it has also injected a newfound bounce and shine that I've been yearning for.  The visible benefits are truly remarkable. My hair feels noticeably healthier, softer, and shinier after just a few uses. The formula's unique blend of reparative ingredients has worked wonders in strengthening my strands from within, effectively reducing breakage and split ends.   What sets Olaplex apart is its patented bond-building technology, which works to repair and protect the hair's structure, making it stronger and more resilient to damage. This means that not only does it address current issues, but it also prevents future damage, making it an essential addition to any hair care routine.  In my routine, I use Olaplex Shampoo twice a week, alternating with a moisturizing shampoo to maintain balance. I follow up with the corresponding Olaplex conditioner and occasionally indulge in the Olaplex No. 3 Hair Perfector for an extra boost of nourishment. This regimen has become my go-to for achieving salon-worthy results at home.  Overall, Olaplex Shampoo has exceeded my expectations, delivering on its promise to restore and revitalize my hair. Whether you're struggling with damage, dryness, or dullness, this product is a game-changer that will leave your hair looking and feeling its best."

Enter Olaplex No. 4 Shampoo – a game-changer in my hair care routine.  Before using this product, my hair was prone to dryness and frizz, especially in humid weather. Despite using various moisturizing shampoos, I couldn't seem to achieve the softness and shine I longed for. My lifestyle, which includes frequent exposure to heat styling tools and environmental stressors like pollution, only exacerbated these issues.  However, after incorporating Olaplex No. 4 Shampoo into my routine, I noticed a remarkable transformation. Firstly, my hair felt incredibly healthier and stronger. The formula is infused with Olaplex's patented bond-building technology, which repairs and protects the hair from damage caused by chemical treatments, heat, and environmental factors. Over time, I observed a significant reduction in breakage and split ends, which is a testament to the product's reparative properties.  Moreover, my hair became noticeably shinier and softer with each use. The shampoo's gentle yet effective cleansing agents remove impurities without stripping away essential oils, leaving my curls feeling luxuriously silky and hydrated. Even on days when I skip conditioning, my hair retains its moisture and bounce – a feat I never thought possible.  In terms of my hair care routine, I use Olaplex No. 4 Shampoo every other day, followed by the corresponding conditioner from the Olaplex range. Occasionally, I indulge in the Olaplex No. 3 Hair Perfector treatment for an extra boost of hydration and repair. The shampoo lathers beautifully and rinses out easily, making it a breeze to incorporate into my busy schedule.  Overall, Olaplex No. 4 Shampoo has become a holy grail product for me, addressing all my hair concerns with its transformative formula."

I have bleached curly hair so I have trouble keeping it healthy. I am super happy with how much better my hair has been over the past 2 weeks of use. My curls when worn wavy look way better - and when straight my hair looks shiner and healthier! Overall, I am super pleased with the results. Sent is a refreshing scent as well, not too overpowering."

In contrast, this shampoo provides a deep clean without sacrificing the health and nourishment of my hair. It lathers richly and after extended use, my hair looks and feels much shinier, healthier, and more manageable than before. My only critique is that I do enjoy a richly scented shampoo and the scent of this product is extremely light and unremarkable. I’m sure was an intentional choice, it’s just not one that aligns with my personal preference. Ultimately, the fragrance (or lack thereof) is a small price to pay a shampoo that performs well.

A few years back I was experimenting with different hair colors at home and decided since I have such healthy dark brown hair I would bleach it so I could use unconventional colored hair dye and basically even though I followed instructions and watched tons of videos I ruined my beloved hairs texture and bond. I've been using countless different products to help me with bond restructuring and this Olaplex No 4 has been a game changer for my hair. My hair is normally non porous, dull, and dry but with Olaplex my hair is drastically changed that. I now have the most shiny, revived, and super soft hair I am so grateful. I have pretty long hair and normally use tons of shampoo but this No 4 was different. It only took a small amount of product to produce huge amounts of lather so I feel this shampoo will last longer also. I did use this with the Olaplex No 5 conditioner as a system . If you have damaged, dull or unhealthy hair this is a must!"

I couldn't risk straightening with hot tools and that's my favorite way to wear my hair. After the very first shampoo, I could see and feel a difference after air-drying my hair so after my next wash, I decided to try blowdrying it. It was already much stronger than the last time I tried to blow dry my hair, about a week before. After only 2 washes! Now that I've been using it for about a week and a half, I'm confident enough to straighten my hair like I used to. This shampoo has SAVED ME!

From the first wash, I noticed a significant improvement in the strength and texture of my hair. As someone with extremely damaged hair due to years of bleaching, Olaplex No. 4 Bond Maintenance Shampoo has been a complete game changer for me. After just a few uses, I noticed a significant improvement in the texture and overall health of my hair. Firstly, the shampoo has a luxurious lather that feels gentle on the scalp. It doesn't strip away natural oils but effectively cleanses away dirt and product buildup. What sets it apart is its ability to repair and strengthen damaged hair bonds, leaving my locks feeling noticeably softer and more manageable. The scent is pleasant without being overpowering, and a little goes a long way, so the bottle lasts a while. While it's a bit pricier than drugstore brands, the results are worth every penny. If you're struggling with damaged or chemically-treated hair, I highly recommend giving Olaplex a try. You won't be disappointed!"

In a week of use, I noticed fewer flyaways and frizz and overall more manageable hair. It did not negatively impact my blonde color either.  I will add that I felt this is a bit of a more heavy system, but I countered that by using mousse to keep my fine hair full. Overall, very glad I tried it!"

The smoothing effect is real—my hair has never felt so soft and manageable. It lathers beautifully and has a pleasant scent that isn’t overpowering. I’ve noticed less frizz and more shine, even in humid conditions. It’s perfect for anyone looking to improve their hair’s health over time. I rate it 4 stars because, while it’s effective, the cost is a consideration. My hair is extra long and it only washes about 7 times with this bottle before it’s gone. However, for the performance and health benefits, I find it justifiable."

So when I say that my hair is incredibly resilient, I mean it. I was already suspecting this shampoo (and the Olaplex No. 5 conditioner) because adding the Olaplex was the only change I had made to my hair routine. Then, I woke up one morning to a ton of dandruff, especially at my temples. I’ve never had dandruff in my life. Decided to do some deeper research about this shampoo and came across the horror stories of hair falling out and the pending lawsuit against Olaplex for a number of alleged transgressions.

I've never had any allergic reactions to other shampoos, and I'm kind of surprised I could buy something that would result in that strong of an allergic response.

The consistency of the shampoo is very, very thick. This is the most economical shampoo I have tried. One lather requires literally a drop of product. I wash my hair every day, but even with such regular use, the shampoo is in no hurry to run out. The aroma is pleasant and cosmetic. But it’s difficult to single out any notes separately. There is a slight sweetness and citrus. Interesting, not trivial. . The foam is dense and pleasant to the touch. It does not cause irritation, as the manufacturer warns in advance by adding pomegranate seed oil to the composition. The main ingredient is the patented Olaplex Formula. It is this that strengthens the hair, providing it with strength. I have oily scalp and wash my hair every day. In general, I avoid nourishing shampoos because... I don’t want to wash my hair in the morning and walk around with an untidy head in the evening. But Olaplex shampoo somehow miraculously prolongs the freshness of hair. Perhaps due to the fact that it cleanses gently and does not provoke the active work of the sebaceous glands. With it, I can wash my hair in the evening and walk around the next day with clean hair. But is it worth overpaying? In my opinion, no. I didn’t notice any hair restoration as such."

So I splurged and bought the big size along with Olaplex No 3 hair perfector and I can safely say that it has reduced the frizzy and dry appearance without making it appear oily. The active ingredient bis-aminopropyl diglycol dimaleate is supposed to repair the chemical bonds that are broken with heat, chemicals, etc. and it works. Since it is so expensive, I only buy it if it is on sale and use it once a week (alternating with a cheaper shampoo) but it has worked wonders with my hair, where it actually looks strong, healthy, and full because it helped reduce my hair loss.

Pros: lathers really well- a super thick, luxurious type that isn’t super slippery, not heavy, extends my wash days from every other day to every third or fourth day, pleasant scent, lightly moisturizing Cons: after a few uses I decided to pair with their moisture mask (number 8) and felt that it dried my hair out and made it more prone to tangles and a straw like texture. In my opinion, this pairs well with a moisturizing conditioner (my normal one is not from this line). It’s also a bit pricey but with the extension of wash days it evens out."

My method of washing includes focusing on the scalp and letting the sides fall down to my ends just to reduce any breakage. I combined this product with my other Ola Plex products, and I noticed a huge difference."

The formula smells pretty good. Thick formula cleans and lathers well.  I saw an incredible difference off one use. My hair was softer. Less frizzy. And my split ends were definitely less and more bonded. My hair loved it."

After just a few uses, I noticed a significant reduction in breakage, and my hair felt noticeably stronger and healthier. What sets Olaplex apart for me is the sulfate-free formula. It's a relief to find a shampoo that effectively cleanses without stripping away the natural oils, leaving my hair feeling clean, yet still hydrated. The texture and manageability of my hair have improved remarkably; it's softer and smoother than ever. What I appreciate most is the brand's commitment to overall hair health. Whether I'm recovering from chemical treatments or dealing with the daily toll of styling tools, Olaplex consistently delivers on its promise to restore and maintain the vitality of my hair. The results are not just cosmetic; it genuinely feels like my hair is on the road to recovery with each wash. Olaplex hair shampoo has become my go-to solution for addressing the specific needs of my damaged hair. It's a product that delivers tangible results, and I've noticed a positive transformation in the overall health and resilience of my hair since incorporating it into my routine."

I look forward to seeing an improvement in the condition of my hair by incorporating this product & potentially other products from this brand (:"

And I have to say the bar was very high to begin with, and it did not disappoint!! The shampoo is a thicker consistency and a little goes a long way. It was quite cleansing yet did not strip my vivid purple hair at all. Paired with the New conditioner No.5 my hair felt amazing! Less frizz and so shiny, and most importantly it felt so moisturized!"

No.4 shampoo was very moisturizing, and was surprisingly easy to move through my thick, long hair. Usually I’m a critic of those who say you don’t need much product because of my density. I actually had to rinse again because the lather was so rich. This is great for those of us who shampoo frequently to ensure we feel squeaky clean. Not to mention, I had zero color fall out, and that’s something I ALWAYS notice with having bright, artificial red hair color."

			"review_text": "I admit I'm so used to no/low sulfate shampoos giving no lather that I was initially skeptical of the size of the bottle. On my first go, I used my standard quarter/half dollar size amount... HOLY SUDS. I used way too much!! A dime size amount lathered in your hands is seriously all i needed for my bra strap length hair. This bottle will last a LONG time. I attached pics showing how much to use and the lather i got just from rubbing it between two hands with a bit of water.  The scent is light and fresh, and the shampoo itself is mega moisturizing and repairing with the same incredible active bond building ingredient you find in #3. Ive been hanging at the beach way too much this summer, I recently went super blonde, and this shampoo was exactly what my stressed, dried out tresses needed.   I have abundant but fine hair that likes to go limp, and i love mega volume so super moisturizing, repairing shampoos are often too heavy for me. Not Olaplex #4! My hair was soft, fluffy, and silky with great volume after using this. HG status shampoo, for real."

It’s the shampoo we have all been waiting for, a shampoo that allows you to wash your hair less often, and blowdry quicker!!! It’s a great consistency with a phenomenal return on investment. A small about truley does go a long way! I imulsified in my hands to break down consistancy, and lathered all over. I noticed that I had more lather, in which most other sulfate free shampoos don’t have any! I also noticed that my hair required less styling product to have an enormous amount of shine, and blowdried way quicker!! Then the best part, my hair still looked clean after days of using it!! Good by dry shampoo, hello Olaplex No. 4 shampoo."
