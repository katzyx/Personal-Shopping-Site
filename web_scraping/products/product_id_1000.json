I sprayed this on my clothes and could smell it after a couple of days before washing it!

I do like the scent and can see myself using it as a hair/body mist.  It does seem to be catered towards the younger generation though, so if you are or know someone in late teens or early 20s, this might be a really good one to try."

			"review_text": "Not my favorite scent, but it's okay. Very strongly sweet fake berry smell initially with a slight marshmellow/vanilla undertone. Honestly very juvenile smelling at first, like something a middle schooler would douse themselves with (although it's not like, offensively smelly, just really really sweet). It dissipates almost immediately into something less bold and a little more warm vanilla with a little bit of fruitiness to it. The dry down is much more pleasant than the initial smell.  This one doesn't last as long as the Velvet Sun scent, after just a few hours I could barely smell it on my wrist even if I sniffed right where I had initially sprayed it.  The bottle is huge, so should last a long time.   The bottle itself I wish were glass, but it's a plastic kind of like a mini soda bottle, maybe a little thicker/stronger. It does have a metal sprayer though like a true perfume bottle rather than a typical body mist, and it sprays a nice fine mist and not large droplets or a stream like lots of cheaper products."

Imagine stepping into a lush, berry-filled garden where every breeze carries the sweet, irresistible scent of wild berries, soft marshmallow, and cozy cashmere. This mist captures that very essence and bottles it up in the prettiest packaging you‚Äôve ever seen.  From the first spritz, Berry Kiss envelopes you in a burst of fruity florals that‚Äôs as playful as it is comforting. The wild berries at the top are juicy and vibrant, with just enough tartness to keep things interesting. As it settles, the marshmallow notes add a sugary sweetness that‚Äôs light and airy, not overly cloying. Then comes the cashmere‚Äîa soft, warm embrace that lingers on your skin, making this mist feel more luxurious than your average body spray. It‚Äôs like wrapping yourself in your favorite blanket on a cool evening, with the scent of freshly picked berries in the air.  Now, onto how this mist fits into my routine. I‚Äôve been using it as my go-to everyday scent, and I have to say, it‚Äôs become a bit of a signature for me. I love how it‚Äôs light enough to spritz on after a shower, but the scent still lingers on my skin and hair throughout the day. And the compliments? Non-stop. Whether I‚Äôm heading out for a casual brunch or just running errands, Berry Kiss adds a sweet touch to my day that‚Äôs both comforting and uplifting.  But it‚Äôs not just about smelling good‚Äîit‚Äôs about feeling good. I appreciate that LoveShackFancy has crafted a fragrance that‚Äôs as clean as it is delightful. Knowing that I‚Äôm spritzing on something that avoids controversial ingredients without sacrificing that beautiful scent makes it all the more enjoyable."

Scent is quite pleasant at first, however it does not last long time . Berries disappear quickly and only sweet notes of marshmallow last little longer. Definitely need to be applied frequently during day for the scent to be noticeable. For this price point I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs really worth it.

The first thing that catches your eye is the beautiful bottle with its lovely golden cap and floral and cursive label. This is definitely a fragrance that you will want to have on display as it is beautiful and eye catching. When you remove the cap you‚Äôre immediately greeted by a lighthearted, fruity floral scent that brought me back to my strawberry bubblegum days. The fragrance‚Äôs mist is extremely fine so that it doesn‚Äôt feel heavy or sticky anywhere after application. I used it as a full body mist as well as applying it to my styled hair. The fragrance itself is so fun and not at all overpowering that it just lifts you up and makes you think of summer‚Äôs juicy fruits and flowers. This is a fun daytime fragrance that I can see myself using when going out to brunch or for a pick me up after a yoga class or walk. I highly recommend it!"

I am in my mid 30s and wear this without feeling like I am in elementary school. But you do  have to like fruity scents for this. It is sweet, and has a strong berry and dessert scent.  There is some floral notes to balance it out. I love wearing this at home or when I go out for a nice Saturday errand run."

Its key notes of wild berries, marshmallow and cashmere wood transport me to my grandmother's house on a Sunday when the family would gather for lunch together and she would bake delicious desserts. That aroma of when the fruit is cooked together with the marshmallow is exactly what immediately comes to my mind, it is sweet, pleasant and addictive. Then the fragrance becomes more floral and woody, but without losing the fruitiness and what I love the most is that the marshmallow note on my skin is not lost and it combines great with the other notes to form a very beautiful mist. On my skin and hair it lasted more than 12 hours and I received many compliments."
