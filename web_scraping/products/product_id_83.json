I used the kit regularly a few times a week for a month and didn’t see results from it. The worst thing is the extra products you receive with it is against your will and they’re terrible. The face wash destroyed my skin and gave me a dry rash for weeks. The moisturizer is okay but burns so I don’t use it. I ended up doing reading on a home kit like this and it may work the first few times but the needles become dull over time and may not work or worse, damage your skin. Please save your money and don’t get this kit. If you can afford it, see a professional and decide if you even need micro-needling."

I did my research before purchasing, because I wasn’t about to splurge (even at the sale price of 180$) until I knew for sure this was for me. I have deep acne scars from cystic acne that I’ve had since I was a teen. I have an autoimmune disease inside my body makes acne a big challenge overall. I’m always looking for new ways to help with my scars, and believe me I’ve tried everything until I found this tool. These photos are with just one use, and I sharpened the photo to make sure it enhanced the look of my texture so you can get a true idea of what it can do on deep scars. I cannot wait to see how amazing my skin is going to look in months from now. If you consider picking this tool up wait until it goes on sale, or you get it for sale through the Sephora annual sales."

At first, it's kind of scary to think you're putting needles on your skin but it's actually not bad.  The device is easy to use and surprisingly lightweight. It fits easily in your hand so you can just roll it across your skin without any issues. No pressure is needed - the needles do all the work on their own. If you turn it on, there's a light and some vibration. I can't say for sure that they definitely help at all but batteries are cheap enough that I don't see the harm in using those functions.  After using it, your skin gets a little flushed and some of the more bony parts (like the jaw line and around my forehead) can be a little painful because the skin is so thin, but let me tell you. The best part about this tool is that it absolutely enhances absorption of anything you put on after you use it. Seriously. Even if you don't have acne or fine lines, I have never seen anything help with product absorption like this thing.  I'm going to end up getting the other tip sizes for my lips and eyes.  10/10 do recommend."

I probably won’t continue to use it and wold probably opt to get a microneedling facial at my local medspa to save the time and get results sooner. The tool doesn’t hurt to use and is easy to use. I’ll probably try it a couple more weeks and will update my review then!"

I have noticed a significant change in my skin since trying the product. I see less wrinkles and fine lines. My skin feels tighter and has a youthful glow.  I would recommend that if this is your first time trying micro needling to definitely watch a youtube video. Also stock up on lots of moisturizer :) ..

For the first few times it was a little bit sensitive for my skin but later on it’s really pain free and the needles are so thin that you don’t feel it that much now. Slowly slowly I can see results because my skin is very sensitive and I have early signs of aging small wrinkles, my skin texture is uneven and sometimes I have breakouts. I would say this GloPro tool definitely helping with my uneven texture and I realized that I started having less breakouts. I really like that it has a sanitizer. And it’s very easy to use just two-three times per week you can even use on your neck and décolletage, and on your body, so definitely looking forward  to buying more heads for the body and eyes. This GloPro tool doesn’t give instant results but I can definitely say with the consistency and in the matter of some time you will definitely see the results.

I'm in my thirties, and my skincare routine has become more important to me over the past few years as I've noticed fine lines becoming a little deeper. I also have some acne scarring from my early twenties. My skin is sensitive, so finding the right products has been a challenge. I have read great reviews for microneedling, but have been hesitant to try it due to my sensitivity. No worries needed with the GloPRO. I have been using it for a month now- and even though I used it sparingly at first, I can see and feel a difference. Both my lines and my acne scarring seem smaller, and my skin just feels healthier and smoother than it has with other products I've tried (such as facial rollers, cleansing brushes, and exfoliants). I did get pretty red after the first few uses, but that seemed to get better with each use. I'm not sure if that's because my skin got used to it, or I just got better about applying the right kind of pressure. Overall, it's simple to use and it is much more convenient (and cheaper) than scheduling facials every few weeks. I would absolutely recommend this product."

It is easy to use, but you must make sure not to put extra pressure when rolling; just light as a feather application or you could get irritation.  Also, there needs to be more communication about what types of serums/moisturizers you should use after using the tool.  Certain serums really don't react well and others feel great. I'm still experimenting with what works best.  Also, you shouldn't work out afterwards because sweat will irritate your skin as well.  I can definitely see a difference the following day and I'm happy to have this tool in my arsenal!"

It comes with everything needed and is ready to go straight from the box.   After 3 weeks of use,  I am already seeing an improvement in skin appearance.  Most notedly, my skin appears more dewy with a more dewy glow. I have not had any irritation from the GloPRO and can't wait to watch the continued improvement over the next 3-6 weeks!!!"

I've used a multitude a products and tools that will promise to diminish fine lines and bring out a natural glow of the complexion and in reality the results are so so at best. This tool is pretty awesome however. I was nervous at first I had never done any sort of needling to my face so I wasn't sure if it was going to be uncomfortable or hurt even. However it was completely fine! I mean you can definitely feel the tiny needles going to work but totally pain free. And while the instructions warn of flushing, I had minimal redness, only a bit in the cheeks. My forehead was probably the worst because there's less cushioning there. Using three times a week before bed, at first I didn't really see very much difference, however 4 weeks later I can definitely tell that my frown lines were less and less visible! And my as time wore on, as well I began to see a more prominent glow to my morning complexion. My skin looked more supple, firm and even in tone. And especially used concurrently with the serum and moisturizer! The morning routine is an absolute game changer to your results too! I have been really, truly impressed with this tool! I honeslty can't wait to buy the lip attachment to see how that goes. It is on the pricier end, but with continued use use, you will see results making it totally worth the cost!"

I found it’s easiest to break your face into sections and concentrate on one section on a time. After rolling, I apply serum, eye cream, and then moisturizer. The first time I used it, it was slightly painful, especially on my forehead and my face was completely red and felt hot until the next morning. After continued use, between two to three times a week, it’s not as painful and my face gets only slightly red. My skin looks healthy and really does feel firmer. It made a slight improvement in my deep lines and some of my pores do appear to be smaller. This tool is super easy to use and something I would recommend trying."

I’ve been using it every other night and following with serum and moisturizer. The most significant change is how it dramatically reduces my pores leaving my skin looking much smoother. I feel like the results from this tool are as good or better than some professional microneedling and microderm procedures I’ve had in the past. And for the price of one or two professional procedures, you get amazing results at home every other day. I’ve already turned several friends on to GloPRO, and I’ll definitely invest in the lip and eye attachment next."

I use this immediately after cleansing in the shower. I sterilize the head before and after using, and always use BeautyBio's Skin Prep Pads before I get to rolling!! At first, I was very intimidated to use this, but the instructions are so clear and the tool itself is so user friendly... I can usually be found in bed using this! I've also been enjoying the extra compliments I've been getting! It's usually What have you been doing differently? Are you going to a spa? You look great!

The gift set is really pretty, coming with not just the tool, but also a case, charger, a spray bottle for cleaning the tool, some face products, and batteries were even included! It was very presentable and also offered a nice way to neatly store all of the inclusions when it’s not in use. The needles on the tool are very gentle. They aren’t super long, which allows for a very comfortable microneedling session. They are virtually painless. I didn’t have any scars or unusual marks after using this. My face did sting a bit when applying serums and treatments immediately after using the tool, but that is also extremely understandable as the tool is meant to cause small openings for better product absorption. I used it for around 60 seconds-90 seconds around my face, concentrating a bit more on my unevenly textured problem areas. I ran the tool as instructed, first horizontally, then vertically, and then criss-cross while the tool is on with its infra-red light. I immediately applied my skincare products and went to sleep. The next morning, my skin appeared substantially plumper, and healthier. I had a better natural glow and my skin for sure absorbed all of the treatments. After a few more weeks of using this, my skin has noticeable positive results. The texture looks better and my skin looks plumper, fine lines are disappearing, and even my dark spots are lighter. It is a very travel friendly tool as it isn’t bulky. It is very easy to maintain, needing only a spritz of alcohol using the spray bottle that was included for cleaning (do not wipe the needles). Overall, it is amazing and a game changer in my books."

Either they do nothing significant for the time investment or cause a negative reaction (i.e breakout, dry skin, irritation). I should also mention that I have sensitive skin and am limited on what I can use due to this.  I am a bit of a skeptic so before using anything new, I always take pictures. I am very glad I did because after 30 days of use I didn't feel like there was much difference. BUT, I took more pictures at 30 days and am happy to say that there was in fact a difference. My 11 between my brows was reduced, my skin has a noticeable glow, my skin is smoother, and the few fine lines I have are less noticeable. It is easy to not see the changes in ourselves but pictures don't lie. I highly recommend that you take pictures also! I like that this product does not take long to add to my nightly skincare regime. While it is a little costly up front, if these results continue, it will be far less costly than any procedure. Plus it helps get the most out of my other skincare products. Overall, happy with the tool and excited to see the results a few more months down the road!"

I plan to still get professional microneedling every year or two while continuing to use this at home.  Overall I have seen improvement with texture, fine lines, and basically an elimination of a scar I had from stitches on my cheek as a child.  One thing to note, if you use retinoids, do not use them after treatment, it stings.  I prefer to use hyaluronic acid and mucin after use.  The serums sink in so nicely.

I followed with a moisturizer, cleaned the tool with the suggested spray and did it again every 3 days for a couple weeks so far. My skin isn’t some sort of radiant treasure on its own, hasn’t been since my late 20’s at least, but I actually feel like I don’t need to cover up constantly with BB cream before I leave the house even. I’m super excited to have been able to try this out, it’s definitely nicer and more feature filled than the one I’d bought and not used, and now all my expensive skincare actually seems to be as effective as others claim!"

I do have to do it every day whereas the in person treatment was much less frequent, but I do not have to go anywhere and I feel overall the results look similar.  It looks like I have reduced fine lines and I feel like my facial toner and lotion absorbs well every night after the GloPRO treatment.  The treatment does not hurt, but you can feel it.  I am always very careful around my eyes and do not get too close.  I do wish it came with more skin prep pads - 5 is not very many when you are supposed to be using the tool multiple times a week.  I have a giant bottle of witch hazel and cotton rounds that I have been using since the prep pads ran out.  I would recommend the GloPRO Microneedling tool to friends looking for firmer skin."

Truly after using it for about 2 weeks (treating my face about every three days) I went to my hairdresser for my cut and color.  The first thing she said to me was “what are you doing differently with your skincare?” I was shocked.  I’m old enough to have tried many different products throughout my years and this is a sure winner!  It for sure feels like I’ve been wasting my vitamin C serums because I believe they are just now getting deep enough where I’m seeing them work their magic!   After washing my face, I pat dry and use the BeautyBio micro needling tool for 60 seconds applying every light pressure all over my face, of course avoiding the eye area.  After this, I apply my serums. My skin FEELS tighter, yet more plump!  It looks younger and I’m not the only one to see it.  I honestly love this so much that I think I may buy my mom one for Christmas, as well as purchase other attachments such as the one for hairline and lips!  10/10 would recommend!

I use it about 2 - 3 times per week, adding retinol serum immediately after and I can see a huge difference in the appearance of my skin. The packaging was beautiful, the tool is quality made and the instructions were straight forward. I do wish I had known I needed to purchase alcohol for cleaning the device myself. Ultimately, this is a welcomed addition to my skin care regimen!"

My fine lines an wrinkles aren't as noticeable as they once were an my rough skin patches aren't as visible. This tool is an easy to use tool an not much time is needed an easy to apply your moisturizer after using giving your skin the best look an feel when doing so. It saves time & money compared to going to a spa an spending thousands of dollars when you can get the results right at home saving you money & time. This is my new favorite product to help diminish the signs of aging an give me flawless skin while clearing out the old skin. As I've started the the 30s my skincare has become a huge priority now in order to prevent an maintain my best youthful looking skin for years to come an this is one of those tools you need to help do that. It doesn't hurt at all an literally takes a few minutes out of your day but the effects are well worth the results this product gives."

Let me put your mind at ease -- this does NOT hurt!  When you go over more sensitive areas, there is the slightest discomfort--but zero pain...so don't let that deter you from trying it.  I'm in my early 30's and have started to get fine lines on my forehead, not super noticeable--but I stare at them up close in the mirror and they bug me.  After using this tool for 30 days, they have significantly decreased, some gone all together.  The products I put on after soak right into my skin, and I wake up with the smoothest, plump skin that I have never had before.   I am beyond impressed with this tool, and definitely recommend it.  I will be looking at purchasing more of their line -- the results are totally worth it!"

Not only have I noticed the tightening up areas of my face, but I have been told time and again that my face and complexion look great. I followed use of the GloPRO with a face serum or night-time mask. I am so impressed with this product and have recommended it to all I know."

After using it just a few times, my skin was noticeably brighter, firmer, and more refreshed. The device is very well made and great quality. It’s a little pricier than other devices but SO worth it. I’ve become so obsessed with the GloPRO that I have to share the magic and will be buying more to gift it to friends and family."
