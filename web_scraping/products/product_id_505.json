			"review_text": "I got a free deluxe sample of this from Sephora and I was excited to try it because I'm allergic to chemical sunscreen and finding a moisturizer and mineral sunscreen in one is hard.  First the good, I have pale skin so that's definitely a factor but this blends fine. If you're coming from a chemical sunscreen and aren't used to mineral I imagine it's a shock because chemical sunscreen absorbs fully into the skin. It has to hit the bloodstream to become effective (thus the recommended wait time). Mineral sunscreen DOES NOT absorb at all into skin, it sits on top and provides protection that way. It will always be on the skin, a good one becomes mostly unnoticeable, with this having a faint pearly sheen instead of a white cast.  Ok now the bad. It's not actually that moisturizing, like a little thicker sunscreen can give me that amount of moisturizer and thus defeats my needing the product. Now the deal breaker, I've used several fragrance free products from Fenty skin and liked them fine. This gave me an asthma attack after about two hours. It was hard to wash off, it took copious amounts of Clinique cleansing balm (five star recommendation btw), I had to change my shirt, and I had to take the garbage out with the tube. I haven't had such a bad reaction to fragrance since I was gifted bum bum cream.  I absolutely cannot recommend one because it's not in my opinion a moisturizer and sunscreen in one but just a sunscreen and two even if you like fragrance I can't imagine you'd want something that would overwhelm your fragrance of choice."

			"review_text": "Fenty Skin Hydra Vizor Mineral Refillable Moisturizer SPF 30 is a great product. It feels more like a sunscreen than a regular moisturizer, making it easy to reapply throughout the day. This makes it one of the few moisturizers with SPF that can effectively replace a traditional sunscreen. It has a medium to slightly thick texture, which is ideal for normal to dry skin. I love using it in the winter, but it can be too heavy for my oily skin in the summer. It sits nicely under makeup and sunscreen, doesn’t leave a white cast, and absorbs quickly into the skin."

It provides a truly invisible finish, avoiding the dreaded white cast even on my medium skin tone, and leaves my skin with a hydrated, subtle glow.
