I did like how my hair felt after using this but cannot get over the fragrance. Will definitely be returning."

On that note, I did notice less greasy-ness on my scalp (I have naturally very oily hair that gets greasy ~6 hours after I wash it). The smell was a heavy nature-inspired cologne scent.

One of the standout benefits I've noticed is how much stronger my hair feels. The shampoo does an excellent job protecting against the effects of aging and environmental damage. My hair also detangles effortlessly now, making my post-shower routine so much easier and less time-consuming.  The cosmetic effects are immediate and impressive. My hair is noticeably softer, shinier, and fuller-bodied. I’ve received compliments on how vibrant and healthy my hair looks. Plus, the scent is absolutely divine! It leaves a persistent, pleasant fragrance that lasts throughout the day without being overpowering."

I used it on wet hair, used a scalp brush to massage it in, and rinsed throughly. I noticed my hair was a lot shinier than when I used my olaplex shampoo.

It does lather amazingly, I have no issues using a small amount and covering the top of my head which makes it last a while.  That being said, I don’t love the scent of it, it’s a very odd smell and it lingers. The other thing is that this product is on the thinner side and the top doesn’t have a small squeeze opening instead just an entirely open lid area. You have to remove the cap and pour it but that ends up being such a hassle in the shower. Not to mention no safety seal or shrink wrap during shipping which causes product loss. As much as I enjoy how well this works, I think I’d try one of their other shampoo options over this one that may well better."

Not only did it thoroughly cleanse my hair, but it also left it incredibly soft and shiny. After drying, my hair was visibly less frizzy – I was amazed. I loved the beautiful citrus-musky scent of this shampoo, it lingered in my hair throughout the day, reminiscent of a high-end salon experience. While Davines Oi shampoo is a bit pricey, it's worth every penny for salon-quality results. The key ingredient, roucou oil, is known for its nourishing and frizz-fighting properties. If you're seeking a luxurious shampoo that delivers softer, smoother, and less frizzy hair, I highly recommend giving Davines Oi a try. You won't be disappointed."

I'm talking about OI Shampoo, a shampoo for absolute hair beauty. My hair: undyed, thin, porous, prone to breakage. My scalp is of normal type, with no dandruff, itching, or sensitivity. I wash my hair every day or every other day, but not because I have an oily scalp, but simply because I have a special love for freshness and volume. The shampoo is packaged in a transparent plastic bottle with a simple twist-off cap. There is a wide neck underneath. To be honest, it's unusual to use such a generous opening; you have to carefully turn the bottle over and dose the product so that you don't spill out too much. As for the freshness of my hair, it lasts for one day. The shampoo does not prolong the cleanliness of the hair, it is rather for daily use. I don't consider this a disadvantage, as it's the downside of a mild detergent base. At the same time, the lengths and ends look neat even on the second day, which rarely happens with my dry and porous hair. The product did not cause any allergies or irritations. Advantages: Does not contain sulfates and parabens; Does not dry out; Softens the hair; Rinses hair well."

I didn’t really like it when I smelled it in the bottle but it smells much better on my hair. It lathers up nicely in the shower and is a lighter feeling product that gives you the straight out of the salon look. I am not really a fan of the packaging. Aesthetically it looks great but it is kind of hard to control how much product you get out. When I received my package, the lid had fallen off in the box and part of it was spilled so I lost some of the product during shipping. I think this shampoo is great.
