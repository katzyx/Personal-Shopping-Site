Next time I’ll buy the full-size of the Bronzi since the value is much better and still small enough for traveling. I don’t like yhe Bloos Color Serum at all. I much prefer Westman Atelier, Nars and Rare Beauty. This product is very runny in comparison. It also doesn’t have staying power. I regret this purchase for the cost, value and quality of serum. Invest in the full-size if you’re purchasing it for the Bronzi mostly, as I did."
