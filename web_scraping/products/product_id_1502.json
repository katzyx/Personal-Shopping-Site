Then when I gave it another go, felt like it blew any other products I tried away. It is visibly noticeable the difference it makes, it makes my face makeup look so smooth and airbrushed, helping it last much longer. I love the smooth texture on my skin. I don't think I'll stray away from this one again."

This doesn't really do much to keep the oil away so I usually use this in combination with another smashbox primer that helps to mattify my skin."

I am very particular when it comes to skin care products and I am not into perfumes. this product has a nice gel consistency and doesn't feel heavy on my skin. you don't need to use a lot and it spreads very evenly and consistently and has a very very mild scent. when I wear it it does not feel heavy on my face it is very light and gives my face a nice even glow. I am 60 years Young and I have been guessing many compliments since I started using this product as to what I was doing differently because I have a healthy glow about me. I will saying that if you try it once you will be hooked and I myself that is the only product I use on my face now. if I could give 10 Stars I would."
