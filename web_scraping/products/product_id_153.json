Remember to always use your heat protectant spray (I love the one from BondiBoost) and only use this tool on completely dry hair.

It’s super easy to use, even for someone like me who isn’t the best at styling hair. I also appreciate how lightweight and ergonomic it feels—no arm fatigue even after a full styling session.  What truly sets this apart is how kind it is to my hair. My hair feels healthier and smoother after each use, not dried out or damaged like with some hot tools. I would recommend this to anyone looking for an efficient, high-quality styling tool. Worth every penny!"

I like that this one heats up and leaves my hair very smooth. I have not perfected the glam waves with this, I have to practice. But for smooth sleek styles this has been great.   I don't like the position of the button because the wy that I hold it, I hit the button. It doesn't turn it on or off, but I wish it were somewhere else.  I like that this one has a cool tip so your second hand can help balance/hold the round brush when you twist your hair into it. One arm gets tired so being able to use both hands is great.  The results I get with this one is great and I've been reaching for it more than my cute purple one from a different brand because it works faster."

First, I found it impossible to not hit all the buttons the entire time I was curling. I’m not sure how this could be designed differently but I found that very annoying. Secondly, the tip of this brush is a silicone type material that is not slick, which means it was grabbing onto my hairs and ripping them out as I tried to style. I’m sure with some practice I could maybe lessen that, but with a lot of hair I think it’ll always grab some. This tool definitely has potential but I do think it takes a good bit of practice"

I have heat styling tools at home, but my hair is stubborn and doesn't stay bouncy for long. So far, this has been surprisingly easy to use and frankly pretty good in this heat and humidity.   Not sure what the right way is to use it, if you're like me and you skip instructions, I let my hair air dry until it's close to dried. Then I use this infrared thermal round brush and start from the roots and then pull a bit and curl in the ends. I repeat it layer after layer and for the curtain bangs I bring them to the front of the face and curl inward (so the brush is under the hair and curls in) and part aside with hands.   Will try this with completely dry hair and see how it is for comparison. So far it's better than anticipated!"

First off, the infrared technology is a game-changer. It’s not just about straightening—this brush leaves my hair feeling healthier and more hydrated after every use. I love that it reduces frizz and enhances shine, making my hair look salon-fresh every day.  The design is sleek and user-friendly. It heats up quickly, and the temperature control allows me to find the perfect heat setting for my hair type. Plus, the brush glides through my hair effortlessly without snagging or pulling, which is a huge plus for anyone with long or thick hair like mine.  What really sets this brush apart is how gentle it is on my hair. I’ve noticed far less breakage since I started using it, and my hair feels smoother and stronger. It’s perfect for achieving that silky, straight look, but also great for adding a bit of volume and body when I want to switch things up.  Overall, the Bondi Boost Infrared Brush is a must-have for anyone looking to upgrade their haircare routine. It’s worth every penny for the health and beauty benefits it delivers. Highly recommend!"

I have fine hair that gets weighed down by a good portion of 'volumizing' products on the shelves. I went & got a professional perm to add volume - thinking that was the answer - but it left me with frizzy hair that looks fried. I am so happy to have took a leap of faith . And tried the BondiBoost Infared Bounce Brush. No more products. This brush gives just the right amount of volume and it also smooths my hair for a beautiful, salon inspired look.  I am hooked. It heats up very quickly - I am not a patient person & I do not like to wait on tools to heat up -- That was also a major bonus for me.  I can control how hot I would like it ( It heats up to 450° ) & the process is super quick and painless. Love this tool. I have been recommending it to all of my friends!"

My first mistake was not reading the instructions and trying to use it on my wet hair—a big no-no. Naturally, it didn't seem to work. After reading the instructions and watching some reviews, I realized my mistake. This particular gadget is designed for styling dry hair. Once I figured out how to use it properly, the results were amazing.  My hair is thick, coarse, and very frizzy, so I usually need to visit a professional to get it looking good. Otherwise, I end up putting it in a ponytail. But with the Bondi Boost thermal brush, my hair came out great—no frizz, with volume and bounce. Plus, it didn't take forever to style. I'm super happy with this product and will definitely keep using it!"

The not so good: I use it frequently - I like being able to have a low key hair style in a short period of time but it ends up being pretty lack lustre and just doesn't compare to a good blow-dry. My hair usually holds too much, this just doesn't give me that hold at all.  After three months of use, I wouldn't be able to recommend this.

I gifted to my mom whose hair is shoulder length but fine and she gave it back as she prefers the Shark. So, I have a tool that's great but not good for my hair.

For someone who has long hair (almost to the bottom of my back), I will say the only con was how long it may take (due to rolling it). However, once I get the technique down just like with curling my hair, I am sure I can shorten the time it takes."

I appreciate that Bondi Boost put the effort in studying that aspect though. Overall, I thought this was great for adding some loose wave and body to my hair.

I have been looking for a thermal brush that would replace my desire for a Dyson air wrap, because what I really need is something to style my hair quickly even if I don’t take the time to blow dry or blow out my hair. I did my research, and knew that a thermal brush would be right for me if I just woke up with my natural wavy hair. I bought something similar from Amazon for about 50 bucks and it had a plastic smell and got very hot. My hair handles heat pretty well so I don’t actually have to use that high of a setting, so when I heard about a brush with customizable settings, I wanted to try it. However I knew it was a stretch in price. I bought it directly from Bondi boost because it was sold out here in Sephora. Total time it took for me to style my hair on 350 was 15 minutes. And the results were magical! The Amazon brush worked just like a normal hair curler that left my hair flatter than I wanted, so it’s just like a curling iron and not a blow out. This brush makes my hair look like I just left the salon. I don’t struggle with volume either but the Amazon brush made my hair flatter than normal and this brush gave me so much bounce in the end result! I was super skeptical but I think this is a really good find. Wanted to share my experience with other people who might be skeptical as well with the incentivized"

I have thicker hair and the bristles slide through my hair effortlessly. It’s the perfect “freshen up” to a blow out look, only taking a few minutes to do. My hair is left soft and shiny and full of bounce. When I’m using it, my fingers and sometimes click the higher heat option, which isn’t an issue for me since I use it on the highest setting, but for someone who is trying to maintain a lower temp, that might be a bit of an annoyance. I also have the Bondi blow out brush and this infrared brush is SO much lighter. It’s now my go to for everyday hair!"
