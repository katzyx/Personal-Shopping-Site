This holds up all day long and into the night with no touch ups. I love that on me, the initially very sweet scent gets soft and warm as it dries down. Cozy is the best descriptor I can offer. I do get some very delicate spicy coffee notes after an hour or two, which I love. This is my new fall go-to!"

One of my favorite fragrances is YSL's Black Opium, and this seems much like a cousin to that scent. This is in the same family of Black Opium, but it's more soft and subtle. This doesn't have the awesome staying power of Black Opium for me, but it's still pretty good. I've had a ton of compliments on this from both men and women, so it seems like a solid crowed pleaser that doesn't offend many. Princess by Kilian has a similar effect."

When I first smelled this in the store, I was immediately interested. I did not buy it at first, but I came back to it every time I visited a Sephora. I finally asked for a sample because the location was out of the travel spray (I like to actually wear a perfume for a few days before making a commitment to a larger bottle) and loved it so much, I ordered the largest size the next day (Sephora was having a rare sale - I usually only get the 1.7oz). The smell of violet is most detectable for me at the start (I am no scent expert so this might not be saying much), but as the day goes on, I can detect vanilla mixed in with the violet and this is exactly the scent I have been searching for. And it lasted all day on both my skin and clothing. To me, it is sweet enough and floral enough to be both sexy and feminine. I hate rose and powdery scents so this one is exactly opposite of that to me. If i imagined myself as a scent, this would be it. Also, I absolutely love the bottle. Nothing fancy, but so classy. The only problem is, after about 2 weeks of use, it suddenly no longer lasts. I don't know what this is about because I also have the travel spray and tried that to see if maybe I just got used to the smell, but the travel spray lasts even through till the next day and after a shower! I don't know if something changed in the large bottle somehow, but it literally loses the scent as it lands on my skin/clothing. I have no explanation - it was not in any direct sunlight or extreme temperature changes. I will see if I can maybe return this bottle and get a smaller bottle. Someone said that the larger quantities are not as good so we will see. I can't justify spending any price on something that doesn't even make it out the door!"

On another visit to the store, I decided to give it another shot. I am so glad I did. This is a gorgeous and unique scent! When I first spray it, it's definitely very strong but it dries quickly and you smell the beautiful notes of violet and coffee together. On my skin, the violent scent is very prominent which I love. It reminds me of a violet cologne my mother would put on me as a child. It carries a bit of nostalgia for me and just smells so good. I think this works as an every day scent. I love different types of perfumes but my collection has more floral and warm scents. It's so nice to see a perfume bring these two scent families together. I am saving up to get this bottle and I can't wait. I just used up the sample I got and I catch whiffs of the scent when I walk. Soooo gorgeous. I think it also works for warm weather since it has the floral component and isn't necessarily so heavy."

The perfect balance of fruity, floral, and gourmand. When I first spray it on my skin I get a very strong powder scent which is not something I like in a perfume and thought initially I would end up returning this however, the powder scent goes away in a minute or two."

Itu2019s still got that gourmand scent but the fruity additions to this fragrance really lighten it up for the warmer months. At first spray itu2019s fruity, but you can still smell a bit of that vanilla coffee scent. As it wears throughout the day, it develops into more of a true gourmand but that fresh fruity scent still lingers, albeit subtly. On me I find both sillage and wear time excellent. I usually just do one spray on wrists as I am sensitive to scent and I find it to be enough. A couple bonuses to this fragrance: first, men love it. Second, the bottle is a beautiful addition to my vanity."

This did remind me of YSL Black Opium which I think is a beautiful scent on others but it is too strong for me personally! So this is just right! In my opinion, The Only One smells more feminine and softer compared to Black Opium (too intense for me or for an everyday perfume imo) and other similar perfume DNAs. I enjoy the powdery scent when it dries down. The staying power is very impressive! It lasts on me until the evening and stays on my clothes too! I definitely recommend this if you like a gourmand scent that is not too intense or too sweet, and has a touch of elegance, allure, sophistication and comfort."

I have been asked constantly throughout my day what heavenly scent I am wearing. As a gal who is not a fan of strong/floral scents, this smooth sweet and sexy scent is perfection in a bottle and is not overpowering which is important since I live in a beach climate."
