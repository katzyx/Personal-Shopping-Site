	"how_to_use": "Suggested Usage:.-Fragrance is intensified by the warmth of your own body. Apply in the creases of your knees and elbows for a longer-lasting, stronger scent. .-After applying, avoid rubbing or dabbing skin. This breaks down the fragrance, causing it to wear off more quickly. .-If you prefer placing fragrance on your wrists, be sure to reapply after frequent handwashing, as this tends to rinse off the scent. .-Replace fragrance after 12 months. Expired perfumes more than a year old lose the integrity of the original scent.",
