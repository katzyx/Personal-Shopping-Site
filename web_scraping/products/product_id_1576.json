I have an older model of this hairdryer, and the concentrator attachment just snapped in half. Reviews on the T3 website indicate that this is a common issue. T3, however, does not ship to Canada. Thus, my hairdryer (which I quite like) is now rendered useless as this the nozzle is not a standard size. I'm going to give the hairdryer to my hairdresser to see if she can find a concentrator at her professional retailer that will fit. Failing that, I'm going to have to get an American friend to forward a parcel for me.  Save yourself the stress and buy a different brand."

I have curly hair and I can easily create smooth and sleek, voluminous, or wavy styles with the different attachments as well as diffusing for more defined curls. I’m so excited to try styling my hair many different ways with this dryer.  My favorite feature is it has a negative ion generator to smooth the cuticle and give me smooth, frizz-free hair. I have a mix of 3b/3c curls that are about halfway down my back and have a tendency to frizz when I blow dry so I really need this.  The styling setting is designed to be matched up with the attachment you choose, so it will adjust the settings automatically for that particular styling method. It adjust for your hair and the look you are trying to achieve. You can also just adjust the 5 heat and 3 speed settings yourself, manually."

I am someone who has alot of hair but on the finer side, I have blonde, processed hair and have tried every blow dryer on the market including the Dyson (which I returned because it tangled my hair and made it a hot mess). After about 4 years of trying different tools from pharmacy brands to higher end brands, the T3 feather weight is the most impressive for my hair type/quality. It allows you to choose your settings according to your hair type, heat level, fan speed, etc... I automatically noticed how shiney and glossy it made my strands and how amazing the setting work. Everything is adjustable with this dryer.  It's definitely lightweight and dries quickly and more importantly protects your hair from any damage. Love that it has ionic air technology, your hair will feel so luxurious. I mostly use only 2 of the extra accessories provided and it's easy to take them on & off. I am sticking to this one because it's the one for me! Very happy with my purchase. This one's a keeper!"

			"review_text": "It’s super easy to tell if a styling tool is quality or not simply based on first use. I’ve blown out my hair 3 times now since having this dryer and I am obsessed. I’d kill for a Dyson, but it’s realistically out of budget for me. While this was gifted by T3 Micro, I will say I was blown aways (pun-intended) by the quality. I wash/blow dry my hair twice a week and do not style it outside of that. This means I need a tool that will set my type 2 curls/waves in place. I have frizz from bleaching, too. I have a sleek and smooth blow out with minimal product use (Orbie hair oil and DreamCoat). My two cons are the placement of the cool button and the excessive accessories. Because the button is flesh with the handle and the placement is where I physically hold the dryer while using, it’s SO easy to press it by accident. That might be a pro to some, but the frequency at which the temperature changes because of the placement gets annoying. A learning curve? Sure. There are two funnel attachments and both give nearly identical results when used. I just think one would have been enough, but everyone’s hair is different, so I can understand the choice to add as many attachments as they did! Overall, I am in love with this dryer and want the rest of the T3 Micro stylers. Truly a game changer for someone who used a $20 drugstore tool."

I checked out the instruction manual, I set my hair type into the dryer, attached the diffuser, and tried it out after getting out of the shower and scrunching in some light gel while wet as usual. This definitely works faster than letting it dry naturally, and I do feel like it helps retain a little more volume and bounce (especially in NY, where the air isn't as humid in the winter/spring and my hair can sometimes fall flat, especially near the top). I did have a little bit of trouble attaching the diffuser securely, but once I got that, everything else was straight forward and I'm happy with the results! Gifted by T3"

I love the gorgeous pink & white colors, and it it just looks super expensive. I have natural kinky/coily hair, and the comb/ diffuser on this dryer is perfect for that. I use this when I need to stretch my hair for a particular hairstyle."

As someone with wavy, frizzy, and damaged hair who has struggled to find a blow dryer that styles my hair effectively without causing damage or adding to frizz blow dryer is amazing! It’s lightweight and easy to use, with customizable speed and heat settings, it’s also very “aesthetic” and looks great in my vanity. It's powerful, drying my hair quickly without overheating or causing further damage. My hair looks and feels smoother, healthier, and shinier. It's also quieter than other blow dryers I've used in the past, I highly recommend."

I have medium hair and used the diffuser attachment and setting which helped regulate temperature on its own and my hair came out amazing! A little frizzy but I don’t think that’s the dryer and more of the user and not enough product in my hair! So grateful for the gift and can’t wait to use in the future"

My old hair dryer always burned my scalp, but the heat on this was is comfortable on my scalp at different heat levels. I went ahead with my regular drying routine and I definitely noticed more volume to my hair and less frizz. Overall I had a positive experience and for the price point and the quality, I recommend it."

			"review_text": "I absolutely adore the lightweight design of this hair dryer - it makes the task of drying my hair so much simpler and enjoyable. Operating it is a breeze too - I just input my hair type and desired styling mode and the dryer automatically adjusts to avoid over-drying. With the various attachments, I can easily create a range of styles, including smooth and sleek, voluminous, or wavy looks for my naturally wavy hair. I am truly thrilled to rediscover the joy of styling my hair with this dryer.  One of my favorite features is the negative ion generator, which smooths the hair cuticle and eliminates frizz, resulting in silky, smooth tresses. I also appreciate that, in comparison to other top hair dryers in the market, this one has an airstream that's approximately twice as wide, allowing for faster styling.  Furthermore, the dryer's styling settings are tailored to each attachment, enabling it to automatically adjust the settings for that specific styling technique. However, if I choose to do so, I can also manually adjust the five heat and three speed settings. The volume boost and cool shot switch are also a nice addition.  Overall, I am in love with T3 Micro tools and their long-lasting styling prowess. I also own the Switch curling iron set and no other brand has been able to maintain my hairstyles like T3 does. Gifted by T3 Micro, I am truly grateful for this exceptional hair dryer."
