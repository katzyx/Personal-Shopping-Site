			"review_text": "I loved this curling iron... for three months before it completely stopped working. It either won't turn on at all or will turn on, the light blinks a few times and then shuts off.   It's a total shame because the long barrel is great, it heats up super fast and creates beautiful curls that last a long time, and my hair does not hold curls easily. But it's a total waste of money, the warranty is not good, I have bought 2 Bio Ionic curling irons, both had the same issue, and the 2nd one stopped working just shortly after the warranty was up."
