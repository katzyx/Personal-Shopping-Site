It just gives you that clean scent like youu2019ve just had a shower with very expensive and luxurious shower products. It is also one of those crowd-pleasers that will have people coming up to you to tell you that you smell good. I wear this both in the day and at night, and it has worked well regardless. The sillage is not super strong so the projection area is pretty much kept to a radius of say 3 feet away from you. The longevity is around 6 hours in my own experience with the first two to three hours having that projection area of 3 feet and the last three being very much of a skin scent. I also really like the bottle design. It just looks so exquisite and premium, and makes my bathroom counter look handsome!"

The heart notes of lavender, cardamom, and aquatic accords add a touch of sophistication that I appreciate. As the fragrance settles, the warm and comforting base of sandalwood, cedarwood, and cashmere lingers pleasantly on the skin. Overall, Mont Blanc Legend Spirit is a versatile and modern scent that I find myself reaching for regularly."
