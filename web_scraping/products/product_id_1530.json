I would never feel comfortable siting on light colored furniture or car seats and white garments are a nice shade of orange after wearing. Wash them quickly because the coloring will become permanent if garments are neglected"

			"review_text": "I'm liking this for quite a few reasons. It's easy to apply - much easier than the lotion and dries pretty quickly (less than 2 minutes on my skin). Not pricey, maybe a bit more than other tanning lotions and products but it's definitely worth paying that small amount extra as when comparing it to other brands; this product has the least streaking and most natural looking color, not orange, just a nice golden hue. Bonus: there is no funny smell left on your skin once you have washed it off.  I find one full bottle lasts me for approximately 6 full body applications which makes it more than worth it for me. It is very much on the 'chemical' side which is the only reason I haven't given it a full 5 stars, but if you're not overly concerned about that kind of thing then definitely give this a try.  ~ My Sephora Top 7 must-have list ~  (My top 7 must-have beauty products of all time, focusing mainly on my purchases at Sephora)  1.

I have very very (like VERY) fair skin (Irish and Scottish descent) and it would always be splotchy and uneven after I properly prepped with moisturizer and exfoliation. I was in the Sephora store about the try the Isle of Paradise tanning water and a lady behind me in line told me to try this product line instead. This St. Tropez mousse worked so much better for my skin. It was more natural, smelled better and less than the Isle of Paradise stuff and also developed way quicker. The one complaint I have is that it does transfer to clothes and fabrics so be careful about that when you are processing. Otherwise, this is a product I will continue to buy!"

First, it is easy to see where I applied it. Keep rubbing the product in using circular upward strokes -- avoiding elbows, knees, and ankles until you have massaged most of the product in. Then swipe your mitt across those areas (without any additional product, just what is left on the mitt).Do the same on your face -- no new product on the mitt, just circular upward motions across your entire face with what is left on the mitt. It dries pretty quickly so within 20 minutes I have applied to my body and put PJs on. Not sticky and very little odor. I shower in the morning and enjoy 5-7 days of gorgeous color that fades 'naturally'. I am addicted!"

My only cons would be is it probably only lasts 4-6 days in my experience not 10. But I actually really appreciate that. If you’ve ever gone thru a bad tan that you want off you know you.

Before purchasing, I read so many reviews for self tan products. I’m really impressed with how this turned out. I’ve been using it for about a month now.   The color is very natural and is not orange at all. I am very pale and haven’t been outside much in the last year and a half because of the pandemic so you can only imagine how pale I must be. This did not stain anything.  It dries very quickly but not so quickly you can’t rub it in properly.   I really recommend getting the application and exfoliating minutes. They helped a lot. The application mitt is like a soft chamois cloth that helps evenly apply better than hands do. Color lasts for a week or so.   It helps to do it in the morning so you can do  a rinse off later as it does have a bit of a strange smell but not perfumey or overpowering, just the self tan smell."

I never have streaks as long as I mix it with a little lotion and blend blend blend until it is all absorbed. If I were to try this method without the lotion I would definitely have streaks. The drying time is a little bit longer just to be sure the product is absorbed, but I've never had any issues and the product lasts me much longer than if I use the pad.

The claim that there is no fake tan smell is completely false, and while I don't mind the smell and it can be covered, it's definitely there. The price is steep, but if you're not applying it every few days, the bottle lasts a pretty long time. This is an olive tan, but I find that it comes out quite warm on my skin, probably due to how pale and pink I am. I wish it was more neutral, but it isn't orange or fake looking. The colour is fairly subtle, only about two shades darker than my natural skin. I've used it on my face and the results have been good, though you need to be careful because it can look somewhat off if you overdo it. I'll try the darker colour next, but all in all if you can stomach the price, this product delivers."

Make sure to exfoliate 24 hours before (I make an easy DIY scrub with sugar and olive oil), moisturize your elbows, knees, ankles wrists right before applying and use the mitt like everyone says. In terms of the color, it isn't as dark as I expected after one application, however, you could definitely reapply a couple days in a row to intensify. Also, the guide color went on with a pretty olive undertone, however I was a little disappointed after my first shower as the olive washes out and your left with more of a warm tone.

Easy to apply. Getting the harder areas like hands and feet takes some trial and error but I’m so pleased with this stuff. I can look just a little more bronzed with one coat or make more of a difference with more. It’s a great pick me up."

I typically only use it during the warmer months or for specific occasions. It fades very evenly, lasts pretty long, and looks very natural for a self-tanner. The first time I tried it last year, my coworker--who I see all the time--asked if I had been on vacation! I'll also mention that I don't like to use this product with St. Tropez's specific application glove because it breaks really easily and the material isn't ideal. I use another brand of tanning glove with a more velour material to put this product on, and in my experience, it makes a difference."

I tried this for the first time with the St. Tropez glove and it looked so good! Natural, not orange, and no streaks even though I am a new self tanner. I applied it so quickly and easily that I thought missed something. It held up to one light shave without fading and now has faded gracefully after 6-7 days. It is very natural so if you’re looking for something really dark, I would get their darker colors. I am pretty pale and it made me look like I got back from vacation.   Tip: if you got a little too much on hands or ankles, use an exfoliating glove/mitt and lightly buff until it’s blended. It does work for the classic color, but may be more difficult for dark."

I used this with the St. Tropez mitt which I would highly recommend getting because it makes the application much more even and you avoid getting the dreaded self-tan hands. Also very handy to have a friend do your back for you! PROS - mousse formula is easy to apply, guide color makes it easy to see where you're applying, no transfer on clothes or sheets once dry, and initial scent is nice. CONS - self-tan smell got much stronger after this was on my skin for a couple hours. After about 2-3 hours the initial fragrance had diminished and a strong self-tan scent took it's place until I showered. I have a few uneven spots around my ankles, but that is user error since this is my first time self-tanning with a mousse and mitt. I'd say overall it's a great product!"

It's easy to apply (I used a mit which I strongly recommend to reduce streaks and to keep your hands clean), it looks natural from day one and fades in a subtle way just as a real sun tan would. The color is not overly dark, so if you're looking for a dramatic tan, you will not achieve that color in one application with this product. I really like the shade, it looks like I've been in the sun for a whole afternoon. The color lasts about one week, and gradually gets lighter and lighter, I can't believe how natural this looks. I've been reapplying weekly, and it goes on just as well as the first time.  If you've never used St. Tropez before, just be aware that when you apply it, it has a subtle green tint to it, but that is temporary, after the tan develops and you shower the green is gone. One very slight drawback is that I did notice it dried my skin out a bit, nothing that applying lotion couldn't fix, and besides, when you use self tanner you need to exfoliate and hydrate anyway, so normal maintenance.  I 1000% recommend this for a natural, subtle tan."

I have used the tanning mit by Sephora but a old wash cloth I have found works just as well! I apply it in circles on my body and do a smaller amount on my face and hands so hands and face don’t get too dark. I have never had a problem with this product being streaky which is A MIRACLE!  Because the product does warn of potential staining I alway sleep in dark clothes and with a darker blanket/sheets on my bed just in case. I wake up the next morning and shower to get any excess off my skin. MY SKIN LOOKS WONDERFULLY TAN AND SMOOTH AFTER. I get so many compliments on how tan I look and if I’ve been tanning and how smooth my tan is.

I’ve tried tons of other self tans and spray tans and St Tropez is always the tan that gets me the most compliments and “is your tan real?” questions which is the the ultimate goal. The undertone of this tanning mousse is the game changer for me because it’s a dark green/grey rather than orange like most bronzers so instead of turning you fake tan orange it actually makes you look more been in the sun natural brown. Self tanning was always such a chore because I had to take so much time otherwise it would look not only fake but baaaad. You still have to be careful with this but I don’t have nearly the problem with it that I have ever had with other products. Every bit of tanning advice ever will tell you “don’t moisturize before tanning” and that’s kind of true, moisturize (and I mean bathe yourself in it) about 1hr before so it really soaks in and you are dry and this stuff glides on like a dream evenly with no streaks. It blends so easily and it sets right up and drys if you just chill for a few minutes then you’re good to go with baggy clothes. Second thing most tanning advice will say is don’t do a second coat which I have found to be true mostly except for with this product. I usually put on a coat and as soon as I finish do another on top and it always turns out gorgeous. I leave it on overnight (though I have been in a hurry before and washed off after 5 hours and it still looked good!) and wash the guide off in the morning and the tan left behind is always beautiful! You will not regret purchasing this!"

It does have a bit of a smell (not as bad as others) and will transfer color to sheets or clothes, though this usually washes out."

I have to really double down on my kiehls lotion to just not feel like a scaley monster and 2) this stuff does come off on your sheets (and toilet seat, or anything light colored that your tan behind may grace).

I never liked to wear shorts, dresses or skirts because I felt people could see my veins through my skin. Seriously. So I always resorted to self-tanning products, mainly because I don’t like to tan in the sun because of all the risks. I started off trying drug-store products, but I found a flaw in every product I used; they were either streaky, blotchy, orange, and/or lasted a day. So then I resorted to self-tan salons, but they broke the bank. Each session was around $35, took too much time, and always had streaks all over my hands and feet. Then I found this product. At first I thought $42 was steep for a self-tanner, and I don’t know who has to read this, but… IT’S SO WORTH IT YOU GUYS. Not to say I’m a beginner with self-tanners, but from the first time I used this I got the most perfect result. Not orange, no streaks, no blotches! If you prep your skin in the shower before applying (cleanse, exfoliate, shave, moisturize), you will get a perfect result every single time. I personally used a tanning mitt and start from the bottom up. I also use only left-over product left on the mitt to apply to feet and hands. For my face, I NEVER use this product; I highly recommend the water face mist, because it’s not as heavy and more sublte. My tan usually lasts about 10-14 days if I properly maintain my skin – use a loofah just once a week, use an in-shower gradual self-tanner   (I use Jergens) for body and the face mist for hands and face every other day and moisturize every day. I've been doing this for four weeks now and I've never been more confident about myself."

It goes on a dark greenish colour which was mildly disturbing to begin with and I wasn't sure if I got a bad batch! However, it faded into a lovely, natural looking tan overnight. I was able to sleep in it and had no transfer to my sheets. I have fair to light skin and It was not as dark as I was expecting, so if you are looking for a darker tan, I would definitely go with one of the darker mousses. However, this was a good colour for me as a first timer and I didn't notice any streakyness. It has been about 10 days now and I would say it faded evenly. I had some slight orange tones in between my fingers so I must not have blended my hands properly, but other than that no issues with any orange colouring.

Any tanning product will not apply smoothly if you do not prep and maintain your skin by routinely exfoliating and moisturizing your skin. Since this product dries quickly you really have to work fast to rub it in evenly so it doesn't dry with streaks.  I haven't tried this but I can imagine you can apply this 2 days in a row to achieve a deeper tan."

No streaks no blotches no presidential orange. Incredible stuff.  I left it on for 7 hours and it lasted me 8 days afterwards.

I usually apply this directly onto the mitt and then gently massage onto the skin and be careful to not let Product sit at all on the skin without massaging it in as it stains and can make you look blotchy. I used this last year a few days before a wedding I was a bridesmaids for and with 3 days of careful application I had such a nice tan that it looked like I went away for holidays.

All self tanners have a slight odor to them, but this one is minimal compared to others (if they don't have the odor, they're probably natural and unfortunately don't work). I wish the mitt came with the product (I think it's about $7 sold separately) because it is essential to application, but if washed regularly, it can last a long time. Color is natural and beautiful. Highly recommend to everyone as a safe alternative to the dangers of tanning. (I've had several basal cell carcinomas and use sunscreen religiously)."

I applied the tan with the St. Tropez mitt and waited a little over 8 hours to shower (both are as the bottle instructs), but my tan was still uneven, splotchy in places (knees, elbows, fingers, toes, upper chest, armpits, and around breasts), and much of it washed off in the shower. My face and chest are just as pale as they were before, and what didn’t wash off on the rest of my body now looks very orange. At first I thought this could be because I exfoliated my face and chest (due to acne), but this could not be the cause because 1) the product instructs you to exfoliate regularly in order to maintain the tan, not remove it, and 2) I also exfoliated on my upper back and it was not as light. The only aspects keeping it from 1 star in my book are that the smell was not bad and that BEFORE I took a shower, the tan was moderately even but very dark and natural-looking."

It is definitely darker, no green base anymore, and my pale skin is orange. I have nothing positive to say about the new formula as you can see. The older version has a nice green base and was very easy to blend and fool proof, it went over areas seamlessly no matter how many layers you slathered on to build your tan. My knuckles have a pertruding Orange tinge to them with the new version. I no longer have a healthy glow in the sun and I look bad in all lights opposed to the older version I looked natural no matter what light I was in, it was that good. They added more fragrance however it goes away after about 2-3 hours and you’re left with a STRONG DHA smell. The color is also 1-2 shades darker then what it used to be. Whoever’s idea it was to shade the formula should be fired. I wont be repurchasing unless they add either the green base back or add the old version to the line. Disappointing."

This bottle will last you for quite some time, even if you're using it 2-3 times per week. I used the St Tropez application mitt, and it went on smoothly and dried quickly. I also purchased the St Tropez eraser mitt which helped get rid of any saturated areas around my knees and ankles the next day (you know, the spots that get grossly dark and splotchy and give away the fact that your tan is fake). With regular exfoliating and moisturizing, my tan wore for a few days before gradually fading. If you're wondering if this is worth the money, I would say YES, it's so much better than anything I've ever tried from the drugstore. This even beats the $20  spray tans I've gotten, both in appearance AND cost. 10/10 will most definitely purchase again."

BTW, the dark 1hr mousse and clear stainless mousse work just as well!!! I have all three depending my needs (overnight tan, super quick tan, on-the-go tan under clothes) and I always use the mitts to apply. Each mitt lasts me quite a few applications.  The classic goes on easily and smells faintly of tanner. As it dries and works, it smells stronger. I wouldn't go out without washing it off so this tanner is what I use late at night so that it can tan my skin overnight. I've never ruined an outfit or pillow or sheets with St Tropez tan."

As a girl often referred to as Snow White and that people crowd around in pictures so that they look tanner, this is my new Holy Grail. The bronzer really helps you not miss a spot, and I feel like it being a mousse it what really makes it spread well and not streak. The mitt is a must also. Not only is the application flawless, but the color is so natural. My DAD even commented on how great the color was. I put this on before going to visit my sister in Miami and her friends were shocked that I wasn't the same color as the sand for once. HIGHLY recommended and SO worth the price."

I showered around 10am and have lost ALL color. I'm not sure if I wasn't supposed to shower for a day or so. Seems odd and feels pointless now to have even used the tanner.

That being said, it doesn't take long (even for a novice like me) to master the application process, especially if you use a mitt. Some recommendations would be: 1. Exfoliate right before and probably for a couple days before if possible; 2. Don't shave your legs right before tanning; 3. Put moisturizer on knees, ankles, elbows, tops of feet and back of hands to minimize these areas getting too much product on them;  4. It dries fast, but the marker color will transfer so don't put anything precious on until after you've showered that off. This stuff is now part of my weekly schedule; every Sunday I shower and exfoliate and then apply this stuff all over doing one leg, one arm, front torso and back torso at a time. Day one is pretty intense, as far as color, but by day two or three it's just really nice and for me it lasts nearly all week. I plan out my wardrobe based on the level of tan I know I will be at that point in the week. It's just fun. Smell is minimal and the color is never orange."

Second Is it goes on easy like you have time to rub it in before it dries and gets uneven like i found Vita Liberta did. Third is how little product you need to actually cover a surface. The color is instant and it is nice and natural. I did one application two days ago and I'm still so tan even after 1 shower and washing my face 3 times.

And the 'slight' tan it did give completely disappeared within 2 days, and I don't even shower every day. Giving 2 stars because it didn't end up patchy or streaky and the slight colour change was actually a very natural looking skin tone, not orange whatsoever.

I'm fair skinned, and while it does look natural in color, the streaks and patchy-ness do not look natural. No matter how well I exfoliate, this product ends up streaking and patching up in the weirdest places on my body, and I use the mitt. Not only that, but this isn't buildable. Once you use it, you have to wait for it to wash off of your body completely (which could take more than a couple of showers) before you can re-apply it or else it will build up on whatever is left of the old layer of self-tanner, and you will end up looking unnaturally darker in some places than in others. So you basically have to fade back to pale before you can tan, so it's not very consistent to say the least. Also, they claim it doesn't smell like self-tanner, but it totally does."

I did a test run about a month before, and it turned out great! It was very natural looking, and not at all orange. I bought the larger bottle, and have done two full body tans (I'm a pretty thick girl too), and there's still more than half of the bottle left. My first run, I did had a dark patch on my ankle, but that was user-error. My second go was flawless.  Tips:  -Exfoliate like crazy before hand. I used a wash rag with a body scrub. Really scrub your elbows, ankles, knees, wrists, and neck. Also, I'd recommend shaving after exfoliating, for the smoothest application. -Fully dry your body, before applying. I literally just stood in front of a fan for a while, to make sure I was completely dry. -I applied a super light layer of lotion to the backs of my hands, the tops of my feet, my knees, and elbows. Fake tanner loves to hang out in those areas, so it helps prevent any extra saturation. - With the application mitt, apply a pump or two, using upward (but slightly arched) motions, to each leg. Since the foam is brown, it's pretty easy to see what you've covered. A full length mirror is pretty handy for this. Again, let it dry completely. It'll still feel a little sticky, in my opinion, but it should be dry. -Apply to torso and back in same fashion. Dry fully. -Then apply to arms. Dry fully. -Wash your hands, because some of the foam may have snuck through. -Now, there will be some residual foam on the mitt. You might not see it, but it's there. Take the mitt, and rub it on your feet, toes, ankles, wrists, backs of your hands, and fingers. I also do my face last (which I've already moisturizer), so my face isn't totally pale. It seems like it's not enough, but it definitely is. -After my body is fully dried, I still stand in front of the fan for even longer, to really make sure. I get dressed with an oversized shirt, and loose short shorts. I sleep for eight hours with the foam on, with a fan pointed at me, so I don't sweat it off. -In the morning, I gently rinse off the fake tan first, and then take my shower as usual. -Your shirt will definitely be stained from the fake tan, but it doesn't rub off of your skin or leave any weird marks. it's basically just the excess coming off. -After all of that, you'll have a beautiful tan! Be sure to exfoliate after three days or so, to prevent any weird splotches as it fades. Dark spots will appear, when dead skin isn't sloughing off at the same rate as other areas. So, exfoliating later is important too!"

I have very fair skin, so most self-tanners end up being streaky on me.The mousse is very velvety, goes on smooth with the mitt or latex gloves, and it is easy to see where you've applied it.   My routine is to moisturize moisturize moisturize every day before I apply my tanner. Exfoliate really well on the day you are applying. You will have a flawless tan! For me, my tan lasts a good 3-5ish days if I moisturize. It will fade if you swim in chlorine or salt water and it will get a little patchy when the tan wears off (but you will get that with any fake tan)  I'm not kidding when I say me and my friends swear by the St. Tropez products - works for my fair skin and my friend's medium/tan skin too, so definitely versatile.

While they served me justice, it wasn't until an Amazon whim purchase of St Tropez that changed my world. I haven't used anything but St Tropez since late 2013!  You should know that I have very pale skin, dozens of moles and freckles, and many red acne scars on my face. St Tropez evened my body skin tone and complexion to a gorgeous, natural, luxurious, radiant glow. St Tropez made me feel incredibly sexy and attractive as it blended my all-over-body depigmentation into one blended, bronzed, and flawless complexion. St Tropez is part of my biweekly routine - an exfoliative shower and paint application that will last me at least 4 days with daily showers and 7-8 days if I shower every other day.  St Tropez doesn't leave me smelling like the typical burnt skin fake tan signature. It leaves me and my sheets smelling like coconut sunscreen. It will dirty white sheets and clothes, but it's nothing that a regular cold wash can't perfectly wash out. If I apply the self tanner without exfoliating the previous tanner off, it will come out orange and patchy. But as the basis of every self tanner goes, it will only be as good as the canvas you provide!  St Tropez will remain my tried and true, ultimate beauty staple. While my hair and makeup favourites are ever evolving, St Tropez has stayed the same for 4 years straight."

There's a bit of a smell when using this, but I believe it's tolerable and better than the scent of most self-tanners.  If you are fair-skinned, give this a shot.  I was nervous to try this at first because I thought it might be too dramatic, but it's very natural. It doesn't make me look orange or fake in anyway.  I could see how medium-darker complexions wouldn't be that impressed by this product ( if that's you check out their dark mousse) because it is so natural.

I've tried so many different self tanners from high end to drugstore, from lotions to gels to mousses, and unfortunately for my wallet St. Tropez does it best. After exfoliating, I apply this tanner with the St Tropez mitt (which is super soft and durable btw) in long straight up and down strokes, then in a light circular motion if it needs more blending. You do have to work quickly because it dries fairly fast, but I like that in a tanner because I hate to feel tacky for an extended period of time while it dries - this one only takes about 5 mins. This tanner is never streaky on me, has a really clean scent (sometimes reminds me of diaper cream with more perfume but it's still nice), never orange and honestly has minimal DHA smell after it's fully developed. It doesn't transfer to my clothes or sheets at all which is huge. I apply it at night and sleep in it to develop and rinse off by morning, and I always wake up to a perfect and very natural golden glow. If I want it even darker I just apply a second coat the next day, but honestly as someone who loves a deep dark tan I rarely feel the need to do this because it looks so beautiful with just the one coat. It lasts a whole week and then some if I'm good about moisturizing every day, and comes off nicely with my exfoliating pad when it's time to reapply. Overall, I will definitely continue to repurchase even though the price makes me cringe - it's THAT good."

I have tried every self-tanner out there and have had the best results with this one.  Get the mitt - it is worth it.  Another great alternative is disposable rubber gloves that you can get at the drug store.  The trick is to moisturize first - right out of the shower, and then apply the mouse (using the mitt or gloves). The base coat of lotion will keep the mousse from saturating on dry skin.  I have not had any issues with the color being uneven or orange.  It will come off on your sheets and workout clothes but it easily launders out - small price to pay for safe color without parabens.  The improvements to the scent really help mask that weird self-tanner smell you get from other brands."

One thing that I don't think is emphasized enough is that St. Tropez came out with this Classic line in response to customers complaining of the DHA smell that sticks with you whenever you applied the normal (old, non classic) formula. They didn't want to reformulate the product (because St. Tropez is one of great ones!), so to address it, they added a complementary scent rather than removing the almighty DHA. IT WORKED! I loved my old mousse but was considering other brands due to the smell, I couldn't take it anymore, and then came the Classic! In some moments I can still detect the plain DHA but the new scent absolutely makes up for it the other 90% of the time. That being said, I still think you should wash it off because that nice new smell doesn't last as long as the DHA -I recommend showering/exfoliating early/mid evening, applying it, going to bed a few hours later and taking another rinse in the morning to not affect the tan. And of course use a mitt and be careful on the joints, enjoy!"

Rinsing the product off will reveal an even tan whereas if you do not shower, you will be streaky and patchy. It also takes care of that self-tan smell.

I used to use the Jergen's Instant Sun mousse, but I am willing to pay the extra $ for the more natural-looking color. 4 starts because you need to apply about every other day to keep the color going, and hard to rub in, you have to even it out FAST. I definitely suggest using some type of applicator mitt and not your hands. Purchased the travel size or got through points system (can't remember which), but purchased the full size after the small ran out. The small lasted about 3 applications, so I'm thinking the full size should be about 4 times as many applications. I don't use it for my face, as I can break out easily.

I like to walk around naked anyways after I shower so I apply regular body lotion wait 5min and then apply this and hang out for about 10-20 minutes just to make sure it dries really well.  Make sure whatever you put on right after isn't white though since this will rub off a little. It also wears of fast after a work out.

I'm at an age (33) where sitting in the sun to tan isn't worth the aging effects or the time, especially when working 9-5 M-F consumes most of the summer sun. This tanner gives me summer confidence without harming my skin. It's easy to apply when you use a mitt and I never feel I look orange or streaky. I apply it right after I shower and moisturize. I wish someone invented a contraption to make putting self tanner on one's back easier because that would be super handy for someone living alone w/o extra hands to help! :) Also, I feel the self tanner smell is minimal."

I'm worried about it being streaky, since it was a bit harder to spread, but with the glove (a MUST) it still spread OK.  The smell is REALLY DIFFERENT than the old formula.  Much nicer, actually, so I thought i might've gotten a straight-up bronzer instead of an actual self-tanner since it doesn't have that typical self-tanner smell.

My goodness, it looks so much better and much more natural than orange/yellow based ones! I think a little goes a long way. It had a pleasant smell when applied and it didn't go on to smell like a spray tan as time went on. I used a big fluffy foundation brush to apply it, as I do all of my tanning stuff. It looks perfect. My only complaint is that it was quite splotchy on my face. Some times I don't really like to tan my face, especially since I wash and exfoliator it so often and it doesn't stay anyways. But, I thought I'd give this one a try. I actually had to wash it off and use my Tarte tanning face towel. All in all-great product and I will purchase the full size!"

It was really easy to apply a thin, even layer (I purchased and used the mitt -- highly recommend using it), and I noticed a subtle difference right away. The color gradually grew as the day went on and looked great. The product has a light smell, but honestly I was expecting way worse; it wasn't altogether unpleasant and was gone by the next day. I look so nice and tan! I have fair skin so I feel like looking orange or WAY too dark could have easily happened, but I'm super happy with the results.

So no biggie. BUT the awesome part about the new formula is that you can see it's tinted greener, so the color when it dries is even better than before. I have tried to find a better tanner than this one, but nothing compares. This one goes on easily, which is huge, some don't blend well, and lasts just as long as any other brand. And, it comes in a mousse which is all I buy anymore. If you're doing it yourself mousse is the best. It's also a great price for 8 oz. My skin is pretty dry and this doesn't patch up on me.

			"review_text": "I am on the fence with this product. Why? Cause it has good and bad points.  Pros: Doesn't take much to cover your whole body (I had a small bottle and only used a quarter of the product), color is a good match and not completely (I'll explain completely in cons) orange. Fairly easy to use if you have the mitt to help. This was my first true full body self tanning application experience and I do truly like the color I got from one application.  I'm a medium olive skin tone for reference.  Cons: It does streak (Not truly the self tanners fault) because some places are hard to reach and it isn't immediate so when you wake the next day you see it but it's not extreme. I truly think the mitt is good and bad at the same time cause the bad is the excess product as you keep applying gets cakey in the process. The pro above I would explain is the streaking is orange but seams to be pretty fix able with a makeup remover wipe to dull them down (which makes me wonder just how long this will last once I shower). Why do your feet streak and look the worst with all self tanners? I've done my legs in the past and feet always look gross and that's the self tan dead giveaway!  I only decided to try this process because I'm going on a trip to Costa Rica and winter left my skin with no glowy tan even though I live in Florida. I did the whole process of exfoliating and lotion before as a prep and used all St. TROPEZ products. All and all I do like the product except for the few minor glitches which to some with a lighter skin tone could have a problem with and that's why I'm truly on the fence about it. I only wrote this after first application and sleeping over night in it so I can't speak for how long it last but with even a small bottle I have enough to last for about 3 more application if it only lasts a few days.  It's worth a try I think if your wanting a nice tan without the sun exposure or for a special event but give your self time to correct any issues before hand. I gave myself an extra day so I can correct any issues. Hope this helps others! In order for it to be completely streak free I think you would need help with applying so for the price spraying would probably be easier. : )"
