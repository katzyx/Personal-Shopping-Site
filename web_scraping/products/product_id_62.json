			"review_text": "This is a remarkable gloss. The texture is great (not at all sticky), it feels moisturizing, and it lasts longer than one would expect. I love that it has no fragrance! I do wish that they would add darker, deeper colors. The two that I purchased are nice but not deep enough. I would appreciate a deep, cool-toned plum or a blue-based red. The current options don't add enough color for me, unfortunately. The Amber Shine doesn't seem like mahogany plum to me - it seems like a warm red-brown. I don't notice much, if any, cool tone."

			"review_text": "When I saw this gloss on display at Sephora I immediately fell in love with it. It’s a very beautiful slightly blue undertoned pink gloss with very fine golden glitter. The formula is thin and keeps the lips very hydrated. I tested it on my hand before buying it but once I took it home and put it on my lips it was pretty much giving ✨NOTHING✨. And I wouldn’t consider my lips to be hyperpigmentated or anything. Color doesn’t really show up and it just gives a look of wet lips. For the price, I can’t justify its performance because besides from being too sheer in pigment, it doesn’t even give you a high gloss finish. Overall I am heartbroken because I really like what I see in the tube but it just doesn’t look the same when put on."

			"review_text": "I redeemed some beauty points for a trial size of this in the Clear color. Usually lip gloss is too sticky for my preference and I stick with mostly lip balms. I’ve yet to find a lip balm that doesn’t leave my lips feeling flaky when the lip balm finally absorbs completely. This lip gloss is neither sticky nor does it leave my lips feeling flaky when the lip gloss wears off. I’m a lip biter so flaky lips is a big concern for me as they are super easy to get me back in the habit of lip biting if ya feel me. Anyways. I will buy a full size of this. Curious to try other colors too."

But it quickly became my everyday always right of die! I rarely use  all of any product bc I change so often but I used her up! Maybe a little quicker than a larger gloss but I don’t care. It’s so pretty - u can wear it with warm or cool tones and it doesn’t feel super greasy. I forget I have it on. I do love the packaging ! Bought my second tube just recently and trying to save her for special occasions but after holidays she’ll be in my everyday bag I’m sure. A treat you should give yourself!!   I rarely use up ANY lip products"

			"review_buyer_description": "Brown eyes, Fair skin tone, Normal skin",
			"review_text": "I was expecting more shine, as the pictures show a vinyl-like finish, in reality this falls a little flat. The color Candy Halo is also more mauve tinted than the watermelon pink that it’s portrayed in the photos. I was expecting something more like Iconic London’s Luster Lip Oil in She’s a Peach, only with a denser and more substantial formula which other reviewers have described. The shine and glassy gloss aspect is pretty non-existing, but I gave it three stars due to how moisturizing and overall pleasant the feel and wear is, and a bonus for no discernible scent or taste. I’ll probably return this in exchange for the cherry, because I think I would enjoy a red color in this formulation."

Both colors have a very pretty, very sheer wash of color with a decent amount of shine (nothing over the top). What makes this formula special to me is how it feels on my lips. It is very moisturizing and it is not sticky at all. It makes my lips feel really soft and hydrated. The packaging is very nice and it is not scented. The doe foot could be bigger but you really don't need to apply a lot."
