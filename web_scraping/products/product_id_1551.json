I have to use the back of the applicator as I find there is just enough without being too much. However this in turn leads to the tube becoming messy if I wipe off the product on the side. I don’t know, I want to love it but I really feel like the packaging really needs attention."

First, there is very little product in the tube - most of the space is taken up by the applicator. I also feel like the cap could be made smaller - I love the eco friendly packaging without plastic, but the large top adds unnecessary weight to the product. Second, excess product comes out of the tube every time I screw the top back on, which has ruined multiple things inside my purse. I have two shades of the oil and both of them do this. Because of this, I have started to put it on before I go out, then bring different lip products with me as to not get it all over everything in my bag. For the price, I would expect effective packaging and more product. I've never written a product review before but I would love if these issues could be changed moving forward. As of now, I'm not planning on repurchasing the lip oil because of these reasons, but I do LOVE the formula."

I'll start with the positives, the color is pretty and the packaging looks nice. after you get over the packaging cuteness you realize how crappy it actually is. The product comes with barely anything in it. it looked like I received something that had been used several times and the little product you do get ends up all over the cap or stuck at the bottom because the wand doesnt reach all the way inside. The actual oil isn't an oil at all. it's like a thick goopy liquid lip balm with no scent. I see why sf would try to hop on the lip oil trend since it was everywhere but they should stick to the butter balms or take this back to the drawing board. and on top of all of that its not very moisturizing. I used it maybe 10 times and it's almost gone."
