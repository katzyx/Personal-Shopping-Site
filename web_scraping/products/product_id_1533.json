It used to glide right on like butter, and was extremely easy to make long wings with, even for me (I have hooded eyes and am not particularly good with eyeliner). I just ordered another batch of 4 and they are all dry as a bone. They seem completely dried out. They go on super scratchy and the result looks terrible, like a little kid did my eyeliner. They are all like this, it wasn't just one in the batch, so I'm returning them. Just wanted to warn anyone else who was thinking about buying or rebuying, this is not the same product that it was 6 months or a year ago."

I had to give it about 4 days to learn to handle the brush to get the same line I was used to getting with the KVD, at first had issues with getting a straight line. The ink flow is comparable, I am storing the liner horizontal as noted and the pigment is actually richer, a deeper black. Liner stays on all day through tears and hikes without budging or smearing onto hooded eyelids and it comes off relatively easily with warm water and coconut oil."

Not 24, but that's well-enough for me!   Expert (I am not an official expert at all) tip: I use it with a pencil/gel liner as a base and match colors. My ONLY negative critique is that you can't mess up the application; it stays very well almost immediately. When I mess it up I fix it with aloe gel on a Q-tip and I'm good to go."

Not only is this liquid liner pen super precise drawing super fine lines, but it's also super pigmented leaving the perfect black line. I still rock the cat eye and I now use a different drawing technique which i hadn't previously used with the Stila when I used it before.. And wow it really did make the perfectly fine wing on the first try.   When I first opened this box, I was slightly bummed that it was a product already well known to me... But now that I'm using it again, Stila is right back in the rotation and I'm so happy to have discovered it again!"

I can easily use the point to create a thin cat eye or lay the tip at an angle to create a thicker line. I tested the waterproof claim on a recent ski trip. It did fade and break up a bit on one eyelid as my eyes were really watery with the cold. However, it did hold up in the  steam room and hot tub! It applies smoothly without tugging and dries down quickly to a matte black. I would recommend this liquid eyeliner as it is easy to use and cruelty free."

It dries pretty quickly so it did not stain the upper part of my Island which is a plus because I have pretty small eyes.

			"review_text": "I am an eyeliner girl. I've been rocking cat eye eyeliner before it became a huge makeup trend, so I strictly use felt tip liquid liner. I have never had an issue with my eyeliner running or smudging, until I hit my 30s. Once I hit the dirty 30 club, my skin completely changed, including the skin on my eyelids. I now, apparently, have very oily eyelids, which I didn't even realize was a thing until it became my nuisance. My eyeliner now wants to stamp itself on my upper lid when my eyes are open, the inner and outer corners run and smear like no other, and my norm had become looking like a raccoon within a few hours of applying makeup. I have been on the search for my Holy Grail eyeliner, one that actually stays put, can combat oil and sweat, and doesn't give me insane dark circles. Well lucky for me, I received the Stila Stay All Day Waterproof liner recently, and I can't lie. I expected it to fail me after a few hours, because literally everything else had up to that point. When I tell you that this eyeliner does not move, it does not move. Even with my oily eyelids, at the end of the day the color of my wings seems less intense compared to initial application, but even so, it has not moved. This is huge for me! I actually tested this on the back of my hand, and it stayed put through 2 whole days of frequent hand washing. I even rubbed coconut oil across this eyeliner when on my hand, and it barely moved. As an added bonus, this felt tip is super sharp and can give you crisp, thin lines, or thicker, bolder lines. Ladies, this is the one. I don't think I'll ever go back to another liner unless I can find something to top it, and after all the products I've tried, that's going to take some work! Just get the eyeliner. You won't regret it!"

Applying it is a breeze; the felt-tip applicator allows for precise lines, making it easy to achieve both thin, subtle looks and bold, dramatic wings.

True to its name, it indeed stays all day without smudging or running. I've worn it through long days and even sweaty workouts, and it remains intact, maintaining its intense color without any smudging or flaking. Its waterproof formula is reliable, ensuring that it stays put regardless of weather conditions.  Despite its fantastic performance, I must note that some individuals with sensitive eyes might experience slight irritation. Additionally, the price is higher compared to other eyeliners, but the quality and durability justify the cost.  Having experienced its reliability and impressive performance firsthand, I would absolutely purchase and highly recommend the Stila Stay All Day Liquid Waterproof Eyeliner. Its ease of application, long-lasting formula, and smudge-proof nature make it a worthwhile investment for anyone seeking a dependable eyeliner that delivers both style and durability."

Stays on all day, exactly as advertised. HOWEVER: be aware that some other colors do NOT have the same great consistency as the black color has. I have tried both smoky quartz and midnight blue, and both are extremely dry and therefore a lot more difficult to apply / draw lines. They are so dry that the pigment literally falls off your eyelids in some places. I’ve never had that problem with the black color."

It doesn’t glide on easily and it definitely doesn’t stay put all day long. It smears pretty easily and it sucks for making my signature wing look. It just isn’t pigmented enough for me.

I heard alot of good things about this eyeliner but I always thought it was too good to be true so when I received this eyeliner I was excited to see if it lives up to the hype. I swatched it next to two drug stores eyeliner I own and it was definitely pigmented and the tip was nice and easy to use! It was very long lasting and overall I enjoyed using this eyeliner and I know when it runs out I will be repurchasing it!!"

It has a felt tip eye liner and I found it extremely easy to use. I was able to line my top lash line and create a wing easily. The tip of the liner is perfect for winged liner. It lasted all day on me and did not smudge at all. At the end of the night I used oil free makeup remover and it came off easily! The only gripe I have is that you can’t put it on your water line. Overall I highly recommend."

I applied a tiny bit of water on my eyelid, as if I had a teary eye and it smudged almost completely right away. For me, it acts more like a regular eyeliner. I get teary eyes from allergies so it’s important for my eyeliner not to smudge. But if your eye is dry and you accidentally rub it, it won’t budge, so that’s good! 3/5 for me.

The felt tip has a strong structure that gives ME control over the eyeliner instead of the other way around. There was the perfect amount of product on the tip so I didn’t get too much or too little when I pressed the tip to my eye for application. It also dried surprisingly quick, and I didn’t have to worry about it getting on my eyelid.   Overall, I will buy this product again, and thank you for restoring my faith in liquid eyeliner."

Over time my makeup in general has gone through a transformation, I now have a much more clean girl makeup style and really just focus on bold lips and a nice clean black winged cat eye. My old liner couldn’t handle the “dewy” skin underneath, and was constantly smudging and if not smudging, flaking. But alas, I found the one: Stila Stay All Day Waterproof Liquid Eye Liner. The felt tip make application a breeze, and I can really get perfect and precise. The color is a beautiful rich black ( sometimes liquid liners dry funky colors ). It lasts all day, doesn’t smudge, doesn’t flake, doesn’t smear. I love it. I’m a busy mom on the go and I don’t have time to constantly be fixing my eyeliner so this is an awesome choice! I definitely recommend to all my cat eye girlies!"

It’s very quickly dried, and it doesn’t bleed or look messy at all. It makes very clean straight lines and it’s just what I need! some of these products that are Wet liquid eyeliners tend to bleed or not come out as they’re supposed to leaving me having to reapply over and over and in this case I didn’t need too! The color is very bold which I love I love the fact that it’s very intense black. It’s very noticeable and very very nice color and very bold and rich. I would definitely recommend this I myself love black eyeliner, and the fact that it’s waterproof and doesn’t smear, and it lasts throughout the day is great. I actually used it for Thanksgiving, which just passed, and I had no issues with that at all! all day on, and it was all good nothing to worry about so I would definitely recommend this. I think Stila is a great brand they make top quality products that are premium and I think they’re necessary for people that like to look good and feel they’re using some thing of good quality. Sometimes quality is better than buying multiples in quantity because it’s more affordable..  if you want something that will last throughout the day. This will last, and you’ll be able to take on the day without having worrying about reapplying, which after a day with other eyeliners you tend to sometimes  need to so this is a good option. The color is very intense and bold which is great it’s definitely black. The lines come out  perfect. It goes on smooth not having to constantly reapply or coat over and over and it’s very lightweight and no irritation to the eye ."

Goes on slightly shiny but dries down quickly to a semi matte, however still giving me enough time to easily wipe-off any occasional mishap. The flexible felt tip applicator dispenses exactly the amount of product needed in a controlled manner and is versatile enough to create a thin line or a thicker one - if you wish to build up without the risk of flaking. This has never flaked on me once! Also no issues with the tip fraying despite going through several of these in the last few years, maybe it's a 'wear and tear' issue and I'm just not using often enough to experience that problem? The cap is also very secure so no risk of this drying out It's also one of the very few liquid eyeliners that doesn't cause my eyes to sting and water as I've reacted badly to most brands that I've used in the past.

The pigment is unparalleled, each stroke applies evenly, and it doesn't fade or smudge throughout the day or evening.   The quality is well worth the price, and it doesn't run out as quickly as other liners I've used. I use this liner pretty much every day, and it usually lasts at least 2 months. It can seem like it's running low before then, but 9/10 times giving it a good shake is all it needs. I get compliments on my liner all the time, and every time I've recommended this liner to someone it always amazes them!  It has a few small flaws. It can get a little smudgy around my tear ducts, but only right after application. When it's starting to run out, the tip can get a bit frayed so it's not as easy to get a sharp line, but that's pretty standard for a liquid liner with a felt tip. The only improvement I could think of would be a grip to make it easier to hold while applying."

On the first swipe it’s an opaque black so I don’t need to go over the line multiple times AND it’s water proof. I have oily skin, I’ve cried, I’ve sweat through this, I even went to Niagara Falls and the only reason it came off is because I rubbed it off.

Every other liner whether waterproof or not, whether liquid, gel, pencil, or crayon will end up messy by the end of the day. Stila’s eyeliner doesn’t do that. It will stay all day if you’re skiing, walking to and from work on a rainy fall day, or experiencing humidity in the south. I even applied it before a 12 hour trans-pacific flight, and my wings looked just as good when I landed. The pens also last a long time. I apply it almost every day and don’t run out quickly. The point on the tip is perfect for drawing wings as well."

Before that, I was using Lancome Artliner which I loved for the saturated color but would run as the day progressed. The Stila eyeliner has everything I loved about the others--the saturation, the great applicator, and easy, smooth lines but with actual staying power. If you're on the fence about trying this eyeliner, DO IT!   FYI, I do typically pair this up with the Urban Decay eye primer to help lock it in place."

I also love that the formula doesn't dry out super quick! I don't wear makeup everyday but this liner lasts me for at least 6+ months, I typically purchase maybe 2 per year. The only concern is that I have a monolid and if I blink, sometimes it could transfer to other areas as it doesn't dry down super fast, but I think that's just a personal issue I have with it due to my eye shape. It lasts all night and doesn't transfer, it's also a true black in color! It is not patchy at all. I also love that this doesn't irritate my eyes! Honestly, hands down my ride or die liner, I don't think I'l ever find anything better!"

Secondly, the color is rich and it applies beautifully and evenly. It does not dry out like other liner's I have used. Thirdly, it has a long shelf life and it lasts a long time on your face. It is waterproof.   Here are the cons: It smudges if you aren't careful. It's not hypoallergenic. The felt tip eventually dries out. It is a higher price than a lot of liners.

I have no problem with its staying power (it really does stay all day!!), but the frequency of which I had to purchase these and its price point led me to find another brand I much more prefer now. I also had issues that sometimes the eyeliner would dry a bit vinyl-y. But that usually was towards the end of the eyeliner's lifespan. It's a pretty good eyeliner if you don't wear it frequently, but if you plan on using this every day, good luck. It'll dry out in a couple of weeks no doubt."

I researched tons of different liquid liners, but it seems they all have people that swear by it AND people that absolutely hate it. This Stila one seemed to be popular, even with the mixed reviews. I'm glad I tried it! Applies easily, dries quickly. Make sure to apply in good lighting to ensure its as dark as you'd like it, as you will probably have to go over it to get it opaque. I have hooded eyes and oily skin (and I can't be bothered to be touching up makeup all day lol) so staying power is a must. It stays on all day with zero transfer. And comes off easily with makeup remover when you want it to! (Also for the record, I do a dramatic, edging on Amy Winehouse cat eye and Stila has been great.) Hopefully this helps anyone considering purchasing!"

While the quality of the tip itself is better than most drugstore brands, making the application easier, the product itself is a splotchy mess. Looks great immediately after applying, but will transfer onto your eyelid and smudge all over the place within an hour. I’ve done my best to apply carefully and allow it to dry well with my eyes closed, tried different styles of wing to see if certain shapes would hold up better, neutralized oil on my lids with powder, etc, etc, and nothing makes this problem go away. And I don’t even have super oily skin! Absolutely not worth the money. I was better off using my eight dollar liquid eyeliner from Walgreens."

Not only that but an hour after application, it was smudging into the crease above my eyelid. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY."

I’ve worn eyeliner everyday for 10 years and have tried so many brands and this was the biggest disappointment.  Can’t wait to use it up so I can replace it with KVD again... maybe I’ll use it to write my grocery list with to use it up... 2 stars because despite how bad it is, this little tube has lasted quite a long time without drying up or running out."

I had been using Benefit's Roller Eyeliner for a while before, so I'm a bit spoiled by the fast drying and soft nib.  Stila's SAT liner takes a bit longer to dry down and has a sharper, less flexible nib, but is overall much more saturated in color and pretty comfortable to wear.  And this stuff does NOT budge!  It comes off easily with cleansing oil, but other than that it sticks where you put it!  The nib doesn't bend and leaves a great sharp line for winged liner, and the formula isn't sticky or strange feeling on the lids.  Will definitely purchase again and suggest, just wish it was a bit softer/more flexible, but that's a personal thing for me!"

Not only is this not waterproof, it's gummy when dry, and patchy as all heck. You have to press the tip down very hard to get any actual pigmentation, and unless you do your eyeliner in one perfect swoop, it will dry too fast and the tip will literally take the previously applied liner off. You can also just touch it briefly 10 mins after applying and it pills off in patches.   I don't know if sephora messed up and sent me an expired one (as I also received broken products in the same order) or if the liner is just trash in this color, but it's a complete waste of money. Wish I could return it,  but timing wise I messed up. I'm just going to buy another NYX one and never buy a stila liner again lol."
