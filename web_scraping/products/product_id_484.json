			"review_text": "If you like the idea of a thin, yet pigmented lip oil, this is the formula for you. Whenever I take this formula off of my lips, I find them to be soft and nourished. The first swipe of this is a light wash that shows up on my pigmented lips and can be built up. As you build it up, the gloss does not get too thick where you can feel it on the lips or the pigment starts pooling unevenly in my lip lines.   It isn't the longest wearing gloss, but it does stay on through regular wear minus the usual eating/drinking.   I first picked up Supreme Brown (pictured with a lip liner) and then got Purple Onyx (pictured without a lip liner) since I enjoyed the formula so much. I added two photos in different lighting/applications. Truly a one of a kind lip formula.  I hope more shades get released in the future as this is one of my favorite formulas at the moment. A deep mauve or a deep pink like Ganache with more pink would be amazing!"

			"review_text": "I was absolutely betrayed by the Dior Lip Oil and found this product while moping around the local Sephora. This is the perfect glossy tint. I can‚Äôt believe I haven‚Äôt used this sooner. Purple Onyx is absolutely gorgeous and can build up to be bolder in color. This doesn‚Äôt fade or slide around. The shimmer is subtle and feels luxurious versus craft glitter."
