Let me introduce you to the Algenist GENIUS Liquid Collagen Serum, a groundbreaking collagen serum that is specially formulated for your face, eyes, neck, and decollete. This serum is unlike any other, as it contains a unique blend of ingredients that are proven to improve your skin's health and appearance. The key ingredients are alguronic acid, active vegan collagen, and microalgae oil, which have multiple benefits for your skin. Alguronic acid is a patented ingredient that helps to preserve and regenerate collagen, the building block of your skin. Active vegan collagen is a plant-based collagen that mimics the structure and function of animal collagen, helping to plump up your skin and smooth out fine lines and wrinkles. Microalgae oil is a rich source of omega fatty acids, antioxidants, and vitamins that nourish, hydrate, and protect your skin from environmental damage. Together, these ingredients create a powerful synergy that transforms your skin. I have noticed a significant improvement in my skin's texture, firmness, suppleness, elasticity, and radiance. This serum is truly like liquid gold for your skin, giving you the confidence to shine."

The texture is fascinating and feels a little odd in your hands, but it applies beautifully to the skin. Absorbs very nicely and doesn’t feel sticky or greasy at all. I used the formula for 10 days and I’m super excited to see that my skin is noticeably smoother and less bothered by the cold winter weather. Overall it just feels bouncier and less reactive to the harsh weather - which is a feat in December in Minnesota! I’m very happy to say that I think it’s delivered on everything it promised and I definitely think it’s worth a try if you’re looking for a new serum that covers all of the bases!"

I use this twice a day and I’ve noticed my skin appears more fresh and bouncy. I’ve also seen a significant decrease in the appearance of the fine lines under my eyes and on my forehead. A little goes a long way. When I used two pumps it seemed to take way too long to absorb and left a sticky glue-like residue but when I just used one pump I was fine. I have no issues using this before my makeup either as long as I stick with just one pump and give it time to absorb into my skin properly. Overall, while I am impressed with the results, I have used other products that work just as well and aren’t as pricey. But if you haven’t been able to find the perfect product for you, I def recommend trying this because my complication skin does love it. I received this complimentary from algenist in exchange for my honest review."

This collagen serum has quickly become a staple in my skincare routine. The texture of the serum is lightweight and silky, and it absorbs quickly into the skin without leaving any greasy residue. After using the GENIUS Liquid Collagen for a few weeks, I have noticed a significant improvement in the overall appearance and texture of my skin. My fine lines and wrinkles appear diminished, and my skin feels plump and hydrated. I also love that this serum has a subtle, pleasant scent that adds to the overall experience. What sets this collagen serum apart from others on the market is its patented Alguronic Acid, which is a powerful anti-aging ingredient derived from algae. This ingredient helps to boost collagen production and improve skin elasticity, resulting in a more youthful complexion. I also appreciate that this serum is free from parabens, sulfates, and phthalates, making it suitable for all skin types, including sensitive skin. It is also cruelty-free, which is a huge plus for me. Overall, I highly recommend the Algenist GENIUS Liquid Collagen to anyone looking to improve the appearance of their skin. It is a luxurious and effective serum that delivers visible results. Give it a try, and I guarantee you won't be disappointed!"

My skin looks glowing/brighter, rested, more plump, and generally just better overall. Even later on the same day as the very first application I could see a subtle difference in how my skin appears. It hasn't made any difference to texture or pores but I honestly didn't expect it to, going by the ingredients list, and after all that's what my Retinoids, AHA/BHA are there for. I experience zero stickiness when using 1 pump, but I do notice that sticky after feel others have mentioned if I use 2-3 pumps worth, as per the directions on the product. Yes it is pricey, it smells like a frying pan to my nose but personally I don't mind what it smells like when the results are this good! The packaging and product overall is beautiful to look at but aesthetics can sometimes be at the cost of functionality...in this case the pump system is a bit fiddly and sometimes won't dispense properly which can be frustrating. Also I try and avoid fragrance in skincare and would have been a lot happier if this was fragrance-free. In short: it has its minor downfalls (the price being No1!) but its saving grace is its ingredients, everything from peptides to niacinamide, proven ingredients that help the condition and appearance/function of your skin.

My skin feels really hydrated and not at all dry.. it has this luminous glow to it whenever I look at myself in the mirror, which is pretty new to me because it used to be either dull or not feeling like I didn’t have enough elasticity in my skin leaving a feeling of dry skin or even having a patchy uneven colored skin tone.. the results feel so fast, something I was not expecting to see so quickly!! I definitely noticed a difference in my forehead lines and also my laugh lines around my mouth! I’m not even kidding when I say this, but my face looks more youthful in the short amount of time using this Genius Liquid Collagen   There were 2 times where I felt it was out on a little thick and my skin wasn’t absorbing it as well, so much that it started to ball up if I touched my skin, that’s how I know I used too much. One pump should be the right amount for me and really spreads onto the entire face, neck and décolleté areas.   The new pump feature is probably the best solution compared to the dropper that was you know the right amount of product to use each time.    I did notice one pimple pop up on my forehead closer to my hair line which is an area around the 3rd day I was using it. I don’t normally break out in that area.. after application in the morning, a few times my face felt itchy about 5 minutes after it absorbed into my skin..  décolleté did feel a bit sticky in texture… overall I think this serum is a bit pricey … I probably would buy the larger size (2oz) for a better value!"

Each ingredient is better than the last and the biggest change I have noticed in my skin is that it seems more plump.  I can’t deny the hydrating effect it is having, but I do wish that it absorbed a little cleaner into my skin.  I was trying to wear it without a moisturizer over the top because sometimes my sensitive skin can’t handle too many layers of skincare products, but it felt a little tacky, now I apply a moisturizer over it and don’t have the issue at all.  I’m happy to see that it is now scentless AND that the applicator has been upgraded because I plan to use every last drop! Gifted by Algenist."

It dispenses a perfect amount as well. After using this serum I have noticed that my skin seems to be a bit more glowy and plumped. I haven't noticed a huge reduction in my fine lines but I do feel like the plumping effect has helped them look not as noticeable on my forehead. One thing I don't like about this serum is the feel on my skin. I have normal/combo oily skin and I feel like this leaves a bit of a lightly sticky feel that goes away after about 30 minutes but leaves my skin feeling more oily after the fact.  It's not a huge deal and definitely not enough to keep me from using it because I think the benefits outweigh the cons but it is something to note if you do already have quite oily skin this may leave you more oily than you'd like."

My face during the day at work looks sooo much better- fine lines seem to have been buffered out - I guess bc of the moisturizing factor of this serum. The applicator was certainly manageable it’s just a dropper to control how much you get- one drop for each side of the face. It’s like a gel. I got the mini which isn’t lasting very long so plan to buy the full size. It says it vegan ? So must be from algae. I recommend buying the mini to see if you like and then jump in for the full size since it’s a way better deal."

In addition, the skin on my face feels and appears softer. The day 1 application actually had a bit of a tingly sensation and that affirmed me that it was working. I apply 2-3 pumps of the liquid twice per day, in the morning and before bedtime. I like the way my face/skin feels after the application, and it blends in and spreads well to cover my entire face and parts of my neck. A bottle lasted approximately 3 weeks, and I believe after a few months I would reduce the pumps to 2 per application, so the bottle should last 4 weeks."

When I finally decided to do something about it, I tried every expensive serum and cream I could get my hands on, and non worked as I wanted. My next step would have been Botox but this serum was recommended to me. After the first few days, my face was bright and smooth, after a few weeks the fine lines and wrinkles were starting to fade and my skin was firm. Now years later when I look in the mirror, I see a younger version of myself and not the 45-year-old I am. I struck gold with this and if you get it, I hope it works for you as it is for me."

I have oily skin and this product does not increase oiliness in my skin nor does it dry my skin out. I don’t have wrinkles or fine lines, I use this for preventative measures, but the lines I had around my eyes are gone. The product does have a perfume scent but I don’t think it’s strong enough to deter me from using it. I also put other products on top of it so it’s not like the scent is long lasting. The dropper is kind of irritating but that’s also not a big issue. The benefits of this product in my skin outweighs any minor inconveniences with the dropper or the perfume scent. I highly recommend this product if your skin needs a boost of collagen and a youthful plump."

			"review_text": "I can honestly say out of all the products I've used for wrinkles or firming this has given best results. I've tried everything from top med skincare lines, Augustine's Bader (which I do love and also proven results and continue to buy alongside this) to The Ordinary and this really works. I'm not sure why so many negative reviews, maybe those people really didn't need what this has to offer.. and remember everyone's skin is different! I am pregnant so my sense of smell is that of a hound dog and the smell did not bother me, and honestly I didn't notice it. I steer clear of anything with perfume because I'm super sensitive with scents on my skin as I can breakout. A lot of firming creams are too thick and really cause negative effects to my texture but this did not which is another reason I really like it. I first received a tiny sample from Sephora upon purchase of another product then purchased the small bottle to confirm I really did like it and now I'm buying the 2oz bottle because you get twice as much for $20 more which is a no brainer for me. If you truly have fine lines (forehead) or around orbital bone of eyes or starting to get minor marionette lines then I suggest trying this, even if you have sensitive skin like me! Employee at Sephora told me this product has the highest collagen content of any product at Sephora, and I was comparing to a Dior product at the time trying to confirm I was making the right purchase(not to knock Dior bc they are great too just really depends on if acne or texture/pores is a concern for you). Try it as you can always return it if you don't like it! :) I've tried it all and I truly believe when it comes to skincare, especially firmness and wrinkles as your concern, you get what you pay for. Also, a glass bottle is a must have for me, which this has, as who wants their expensive skincare products in plastic.. not I :) if I buy a product twice that says a lotttt.."

The dropper took a bit to figure out but I finally did. You just pull it all the way out/away from the liquid, press the button to release all residual liquid, place it back in the liquid while still holding the button and then release once immersed. You should get a dropper full of liquid that way. My only complaint here is that the dropper doesn’t go ask the way to the bottom so now I have to pour onto my hand to use what’s left. I can’t say enough about this. I was getting bumps on my chest and décolleté area and now they’re gone. I got two more of these, I’m so impressed."

I love Algenist products but this has to be one of the most perfumey products I have ever used (coming from a Hawaiian Ginger wearing teenager in the 90's). I found no visible change from using the sample, but that may be because I hated the smell so much I used it inconsistently and or because the tester doesn't last long enough to notice a difference. Also the dropper in the tester stopped working on the third use so it was super awkward to get out of the container. I hate leaving bad reviews, especially when the company makes other great products (the dark spot correcting peel the single greatest skincare product I have ever used), but save your money on this one.

To be honest I didn’t think I noticed too much of a difference in wrinkles or plumpness when I was using it and with the cost, I had a hard time convincing myself to pay the high price and repurchase. But in the weeks after I finished my first bottle, I saw a noticeable decline in my overall skin health. My fine lines were more noticeable and my skin was more dull than before so when I caught another sale, I decided to pick up another bottle and the improvement was noticeable.  My fine lines and wrinkles are less noticeable and my skin just feels more plump and supple. I enjoy the texture, how it feels on my skin, and haven’t found the fragrance to be overwhelming. It absorbs quickly and plays well with the rest of my routine.  I don’t want to love it, but I do and will probably continue to seek out good sales to keep this on my skincare shelf. I agree that the packaging with the dropper is less than ideal and needs revamping - I’ll probably try the value size with the pump next time and see if it’s better. I have a hard time recommending this just because it’s so hard to justify the price but it’s worked well for me so I’d only really  recommend it if you can afford it.

The smell is strong and the dropper is not user friendly (reasons why I marked off a star) but I can honestly say, I see a difference in my skin. It wasn’t immediate, took about 3 months for my skin to get adjusted (I have sensitive skin). Now I see true and visible change in my skin’s hydration, pigmentation, and smoothness. I use this once daily in combination with the genius collagen night cream. I had deep forehead lines that have visibly reduced. The same goes for the fine lines around my eyes. My skin looks plump and radiant. I love this serum!"

Once that’s out, just turn the bottle upside down and apply the amount you want to clean hands and apply. The second is the faintly fishy smell I start to notice after some hours of being on my face.

The packaging, though, is elegant but inefficient. The dropper is a hit or miss, sometimes it'll pull up product and sometimes it won't. Also, towards the end of use little bits of product collected in the corners and there was a wasted two or three drops there that could've otherwise been used. I also dislike that when using it I am constantly exposing the product to the air, which I fear may contaminate it. If you dislike fragrance or have a sensitivity from it this product isn't for you. Although the scent is light I have heard people saying they've broken out from it, which I am assuming has to do with the scent since there really aren't any other irritating ingredients in the formula."

To start, my skin has been looking and feeling great since I started using this.  In all fairness, I did also start taking Collagen gummies around the same time as I started using this so I’m not sure which is actually doing the job.  My skin does feel much plumper, especially around my eyes.  I had some fine lines that are still noticeable but my skin feels so plump and smooth.  I love that this is vegan collagen and it’s super lightweight.  It absorbs into my skin so well and dries nicely.  I’ve been using it in the morning and at night every day and noticed a difference after about 4 days. I bought the mini size to try this out and honestly, the bottle and dropper are brutal.  The dropper looks nice but is ineffective at getting the product.  The button at the top of the dropper doesn’t have enough suction to pull the product into the dropper so it’s extremely frustrating to get anything out.  I’ve used other products that use droppers and this one has been by far the worst.  The product is also VERY perfumed.  It’s all I can smell when I put it on.  I’m debating buying the larger size of this product because I’m overall happy with the results but might think twice if the packaging isn’t any better.  I can’t do anything to get rid of the smell but have found that if I layer other serums and moisturizers on top, it isn’t as potent (it still stinks though for real)"

There wasn’t even the hint of positive results; worse I woke up to 3 small new blemishes. I have combination skin and have rarely ever experienced an issue with lack of product absorption. After reading the reviews this seems to be a common problem for many users. I’d recommend trying a sample size to test how your skin responds and to determine if there are any visible improvements before making an investment. Again, I’ve always been very pleased with the line of skincare/masks I’ve tried. I had high hopes for this one but unfortunately it had adverse effects on my skin."

There’s no way to use this without risking getting glass on my skin now and causing a tear (guess how I figured that out) - so a very expensive mistake. Won’t be buying this again.

I've been using this specific product for about a year and a half and I don't ever plan on stopping. I am probably on my 7th or 8th bottle at this point and I can't get enough. Along with the rest of the GENIUS line, I have completely noticed a change in my skin. I don't break out, I personally LOVE the scent of it and the way it makes my skin look and feels is amazing. I'm only 29 so I don't really have any fine lines or wrinkles, but it makes my skin look and feels plump and healthy. I've learned that to get the remainder out of the bottle you need the take the little plastic thing out from the top that scrapes off the excess on the pump and use a scraper or anything long and skinny enough to reach the bottom you can literally get every last drop. I also can stick my pinky in it and run it around the top to get the rest off there too. It was recently my birthday and I just told my boyfriend to give me money to buy face stuff and I did. It's literally all I bought with my bday money from him and his parents because I can't get enough. I always make sure to have enough money to splurge on it when I'm getting near the end. I really like that you buy kits for the same amount as this single bottle so you get more for your buck. I recommend to everyone that I talk to when they ask if I know of any good face/skin products. To me, it's worth the $115 a bottle."

It’s actually pretty easy to use. Take the pump out of the bottle and take out all the air. While holding the pump down with your finger insert it back into the bottle and then let go. The amount that is picked by the dropper is exactly the amount you will need. It’s actually a very smart dropper.   I use this product for its moisturizing effects. Collagen that is not produced by your own body has never been proven to do anything to your skin. However applying this product right after my toner and after immediately applying the rest of my products really helps me lock in the hydration. I feel like it’s great for my combination skin. Helps my dry spots stay hydrated and controls the oils."

But that’s neither here nor there because this vial of liquid collagen is God’s gift to us all.  Don’t let the “rouge” next to my name fool you — I’m a cheap s.o.b. at heart. But I’d heard rumblings about this product for a while and I’d give it a try. I mean the before and after pictures that the company touts are wildly impressive and I wanted to know if they were catfishing. The regular size is $139 Canadian and my bank account was tragically unable to comply, so I went with the mini version for $33.  They verdict? Ladies and gents, this will turn back that clock and give your face the love it craves. My fine lines are drastically reduced, especially under my eyes, which is where I struggle the most. Not only are the wrinkles significantly less visible, I noticed they actually shrunk in length! And the suppleness in the area is more than welcome. I typically despise strong fragrances in products but this is so wonderful I‘m able to overlook that one, small drawback. If it’s any consolation it does smell lovely...but fragrance means more ingredients and more ingredients means a higher chance of irritation. The good news is I have experienced zero problems using the liquid collagen.     In short, this product really works. I don’t know why or how and I don’t think I care. I ultimately ended up buying the larger size when I got my hands on a few more coins and the bottle is scheduled to arrive shortly.   I can’t recommend this product enough. The price is hefty but the results do not lie! Do yourself a favour and snatch it up."

GENIUS Liquid Collagen is the Holy Grail of Collagen,  before I was using another brand but I felt I was not  getting the maximum benefits of that serum, that being said I am getting older and needed to step up my game. This is definitely a level up and a game changer. I had been researching this brand for about 2 years now but the price had me shook, finally I had gotten a sample of this from Sephora when I purchased the GENIUS Liquid Collagen for lips.  I was feeling quite bland one day and decided to try the sample of GENIUS Liquid Collagen, I was amazed at how my skin reacted, my pores were less visible, my skin remained hydrated throughout the day, so I went back for another sample  my skin reacted the same way and finally on the third day I made up my mind to splurge and invest in my care especially since this item is a bit pricey, it is  worth the splurge though. I have noticed my skin is smoother, my complexion is more radiant  and my pores are behaving nicely not to mention the long term benefits with continued use. Shortly after buying my first bottle ,  Algenist had a 20% off coupon so I got another bottle as my back up and I am thinking about getting another with this current promotion so I don't run out.  I use this along with my Genius Liquid Collagen for lips and my Skinceuticals C E and Ferulic/Phloretin C F serums and I use Supergoop Unseen sunscreen to protect my investment."

Used it again this morning, same way. Holy COW!! I looked at my face in my full length mirror just now & the results are so visible, that I sat there & stared at every possible angle for a solid 5 minutes. Definite tightening, I don’t see any sagging at all, and my crepe wrinkles are reduced by at least 3/4. I have never used a product & seen visible results like this. EVER. Highly. Recommend."

What i absolutely hate is the packaging. If I have to pay so much I want every last drop out of the bottle. That doesn't happen. Also the pump proves ineffective in getting the last set out.

It's more clear, runny, and less of the yellow beads (I'm assuming collagen).... The product is more greasy and this one makes me breakout. That did not happen with the samples. The packaging is pretty on this unique bottle but the dispenser/dropper is virtually impossible to use!!!! The dropper is not calibrated properly to create a suction to pull any product into the tube!!!!!!!!!!  I've tried all sorts of ways but to no avail it just doesn't work. Save your money! For a $115 you can buy something that doesn't give you pimples and the applicator would actually work and not frustrate the heck out of the user!!!!

I’m just under 2 months of consistent use (once in the morning, once at night), and I can’t believe what it’s done for my skin. First, I haven’t had a single zit since day one of use. None. Not even around my period. Second, there’s an evenness in tone that I’ve never had before. And third, even if this is the only product I use all day (my ultimate goal is to get my skin to a place where I don’t wear any makeup), I don’t feel dry/tight/oily after a few hours. I literally don’t think about my skin at all anymore because it’s no longer uncomfortable. Concerning how long the tube lasts, I’m hoping to stretch it to 2.5-3 months. I was over-applying early on, and only needed a little dollop vs a full tube."

I use it as a cocktail with a light Vita C serum. The consistency’s are comparable & absorb beautifully into my skin together. It creates this perfect foundation for my following serums & moisturizer.  Packaging. It appears that it is somewhat difficult for a lot of people to maneuver. I have not had this experience. Knowing ahead of time that the dropper is fragile & glass, I always am mindful & extremely gentle. They recommend to remove dropper, push button to release the air, and insert back in to product to suction the dose. This way you can avoid adding any additional air into the bottle. I generally do this after each use, so it is all ready for the next time I need it. In reality, you should be using this method with all your beauty products with droppers, as adding air into products will further its oxidation & expire quicker. So they are actually attempting to educate you on proper dropper etiquette. Your skin regenerates approx. every 27days,  Having had used this over a full skin cycle, I can comfortably recommend it to others. I have had an amazing experience with it & find it critical to my daily regime."

I’m only giving a 4 out of 5 star because of the packaging. I do enjoy a nice glass bottle however the dropper doesn’t go completely to the bottom of the bottle and it is not the easiest to dispense onto the hands/face since it is so thick.  I have used a little more than a quarter of the serum so far and I can easily say that I have not only visibly noticed a difference but my skin is so much more supple and feels softer as well.  I would love if Algenist could come out with this same serum in a pump style or pour out bottle as I think it would be more effective than the dropper."

I have not seen a difference in the appearance of my undereye fine lines. I think I know why... I have been using this product at the incorrect time. The proper order for skincare regimen should be (according to Algenist’s recommendation): wash and dry, tone, Liquid Collagen, all other serums, face and eye cream. Some people say if you’re using a Retinol product, that that is the only time to apply it before the Liquid Collagen. I’m surprised that I still got results even though I was using it out of order. I can only hope that I will see more drastic improvements in my skin after another 4 weeks."

It took me about a month to use this teeny tiny bottle because it seemed to work so well I only wanted to use it when my skin was at its worst. Mostly during the PMS stages. Anyways, within TWO DAYS it has helped my CYSTIC ACNE! Something that I almost can never salvage. It seemed to shrink the cysts I’ve had for months that are just there. It made my skin brighter and softer. After that two day revelation was when I decided this was something I needed to salvage. I’m glad I did! Because every time I felt a cyst starting to grow, I plopped this thick stuff on and wow. It did not fail me! Made it either stop growing or helped shrink it down. Not only that but it really did help my over all skin so much that I came in to the Sephora app to find out how much it was. That’s my only problem, the price. Beauty is not worth 1oz for $115. But this stuff is a miracle so if I ever do have money to spend uselessly I would definitely spend the money on this! However I am a paycheck to paycheck kind of gal so this will have to wait. So disappointed with that face of matter I my because this stuff really did work miracles on my skin in little time with little to spare. If you have to money I 100% recommend buying it. Shoot, send me one too!"

If you do not deal with milia (those weird little white keratin bumps that can appear on your eyes/face) then you will probably be fine. I have very sensitive skin and it didn't irritate my skin whatsoever either which was nice. The texture is a little strange...kind of like a gel with little beads in it?

It's also a little drying. I know it's suggested that it's followed with the Sleeping Collagen, but I wanted the latter to absorb into clean, bare skin.

The great effect went away and it dried me out every time. What's worse, I got very itchy and red after using it. As a over $100 serum, it doesn't benefit my skin in every possible way. And I can see if I continue to use it, I will finish it up within 2 months or less. Not worth a penny and I would give 0 star if there is an option."

I have combination skin, and this didn't cause any breakouts made my skin soft but not greasy and worked AMAZINGLY. The Liquid Collagen is very lightweight and I used it before the moisturizer. The Genius Sleeping Collagen is a very buttery soft cream, made with vegan plant collagen that provides intense nourishment for more hydrated, radiant skin. I’ve been using this combo every night since I got them in my VoxBox a week ago and I can say that my skin is the softest it has ever been,my pores are also smaller and my make up last longer. 10/10 recommend."

The genius algenist cream I applied afterwards feels almost buttery and smooth, nice texture! I have been using this cream for the past 4 nights and I’ve noticed the difference in how soft my skin is and how much more vibrant it feels. I love the fact that it’s made by all natural ingredient like the vegan plant collagen which fully nourishes your skin and helps promote a healthier radiant look. For best results I use both the liquid and cream collagen overnight so it can best sink deep in your pores as you sleep! I received these products complimentary but all opinions are my own..

So it comes in a very nice glass bottle that has a dropper inside. The dropper measures the perfect amount. All you do is twist the cap off, take dropper out and squeeze button to release any air, then pressand hold the button down and place in liquid, lastly you release the button while in the liquid and it pulls the correct amount into the dropper. It’s very simple. You just put the liquid in your hands and rub around your face, neck, and upper chest. This has a very slight smell to it and it’s a pleasant scent. I apply in the AM with my serum, and in the PM with the Algenist Sleeping Collagen. As soon as you put it on you can feel your face getting tighter. I been using it almost a week now and it’s a noticeable difference. Fine lines are disappearing, my makeup is applying better, and face feels so smooth and looks youthful! I highly recommend this product. I received this product complimentary from Influenster for sample purposes but all opinions are my own."

I would rate this as my favorite skincare “Find” of 2018.   My skin looks younger. It has increased elasticity. My skin is softer. Not only do I see a difference in texture and vitality in my skin.   I feel it. (especially when applying my products.) This is my current fountain of youth . I am so happy I finally found a remarkable product that produces results.

It smells nice but doesn’t really do anything for my skin that I can notice.  It is a little messy to apply and the little bubbles or whatever the yellow bits are supposed to be require a little bit of work to absorb into the skin.  It’s fine but nothing special and certainly not worth the price."

I guess technically I did pay for this sample so of course I used it, yeah like I figured it did nothing but leave my face looking like 15 year old boys, there was more grease on my face then the pizza my children ate for dinner last night.  If that statement alone doesn’t cut it for you and your still considering buying this abomination. It’s extremely sticky and does not sink into the skin, not to mention the applicator is terrible and if you want to fight everyday for your snake oil then by all means.  But if all that wasn’t enough the scent of the item is reminiscent of the 1990’s mixed with sadness and old people and gives you enough pimples to make you feel like your 14 again.  The only person I would recommend this to is anyone with 115 to burn and need a crappy moisturizer even then I’d recommend they light it on fire then waste money on this product."

I have a very poor sense of smell so when a scent smells strong to me I know its strong!  I'm also not a fan of floral scents, I prefer food smells like vanilla, caramel, coconut, citrus, berry scents, etc.  This smelled like very strong floral perfume.  Fragrance is listed in the products ingredients so this smell is not from the anti-aging ingredients added in the serum.  I heard fragrance is aging, so to have an ingredient that ages you in an antiaging product seems self defeating?   My biggest area of concern is fine lines around my nose and mouth. So I only applied this product along my smile lines to see if it would minimize them.  I ended up with a bunch of small zits all over this area the next day and where I didn't apply this product I had none.  I continued using the sample just to see if it minimized my fine line but had to stop, I didn't like the strong floral perfume scent. Not for me."

But I didn’t know what to do with it at first! I started out using a drop on my lips. Then checked out Algenist GENIUS Oil online. Three months later, my lips are so pretty and smooth. I already had nice lips by the luck of genetics, but they were starting to show light age lines and dryness. At my age (54) there’s a new sign of aging every year, if not every month! Next I swiped a one drop of oil under both eyes at night for dryness. Amazing comfort and moisture—feels wonderful anywhere you have dry skin. I now use it on my forehead creases, fine lines around my eyes, on my lips, and in my cleavage where the skin’s crepey after 45. Very smoothing and hydrating—and one drop goes a long way. Just 4 tiny drops a night for me, and 3 months later I’m still on the first bottle I bought. Last year hormones started making my skin & hair go crazy. But beautiful skin, no blemishes, a smooth velvety feel, and several improved signs of aging. It has improved my •dry skin •random red, dry patches on my face •tightness and pulling •fine tissue-paper wrinkles around the eye •enlarged pores on cheeks beside nose •vertical lip lines • two deep lines between eyebrows  I don’t know of another product that helps with 7 different skin problems. Algenist isn’t promising miracles, so don’t expect any. But you can bank on visible improvement for lots of common skin issues. And in my case, at least in my case, it outright fixes or eliminates some of those 7 issues. I know that my 54-year-old skin looks about 42 now. I can go out with little or no makeup and my skin just glows and looks younger. Eliminated 3 other beauty products, so I spend less now when buying GENIUS Serum. At night, I smooth any leftover oil from my fingertips onto my eyebrows,—it works like brow serum! My brows are thick and neat. Bye brow serum, pencils, & fixer! ."

It absorbs very quickly and skin feels nourished. On the other hand, I don't know the purpose of using collagen. It has been scientifically approved that collagen can never penetrate into the skin, it only stays on skin and work as natural moisturizing factor. That may explain why this product only stay on the skin without absorption.  I think this product can be only used at nighttime, at least for me. In addition, the smell is a little bit too strong. People even ask me what perfume I wear today~ lol~"

I also LOVED the way it made my skin feel. I did notice a difference in firmness and how smoothly my makeup went on. My biggest issue, and why I wanted to write a review, is because this caused BREATHING ISSUES. I was having trouble for a couple of days and didn’t realize it was the ultra strong fragrance causing it until one day when I put it on and immediately started having trouble again. This is the whole issue as to why people are moving towards clean beauty; chemicals and fragrance cause real health problems! Jus sayin. If you have any pulmonary issues, STAY AWAY.

I might have tried to keep it going, but after seeing way too many documentaries on animal cruelty etc. over the last year, I ultimately decided that I no longer wanted to purchase products that fall under that umbrella. Algenist doesn't test on animals, but they do sell in China where testing is required which still doesn't work for me. Great brand overall and I like some of their other products, but won't be using anymore until they work that out."

I could definitely see some plumping in the skin, but I haven't used it long enough to see if the performance justifies the price point. One thing I highly recommend is spot testing this before using it. Some reviewers have experienced breakouts which is likely due to the fact that this formula contains niacinamide --  a wonderful ingredient that some people may be sensitive to. Because this contains niacinamide, I also recommend not using any BHA or AHA directly before or after. That being said, this stuff is great with retinoids / retinol and I will likely be purchasing the full size."

For the most part, I stayed consistent. I don't love the scent, not that there is a scent, per se. It also leaves the skin a tiny bit tacky, so I always follow with serum and/or moisturizer."

I also have a pretty wrinkly forehead also from picking at it and this has helped that too. I’m not sure if it’s because my lines aren’t as deep that’s why it worked so good for me. But I also see older people that love this too. This just worked so amazingly for me. I purchased the $80 Algenist kit that came with the 6ml bottle. I wanted to try some other products from them and make sure this wouldn’t break me out long term. It didn’t. My skin looks radiant, SO SMOOTH and it literally glows. Sometimes I don’t even need to use a moisturizer with this but it’s not too greasy to do so. I live in Maine so with most of the year cold and dry, this has been my life saver.

Excited to see those results as that’s what I was REALLY looking for in a serum I ran to Sephora to get the full size bottle during the VIB sale. Excited to update this with my results after 30 days and in combination with their eye cream and moisturizer that I grabbed samples for upon purchasing this to see how they work in conjunction with the serum.  I’d give it 5 stars, but it’s so early on I don’t think I’ve even begun to see the full potential of this product. As of now this is totally my holy grail of products right now. So much that I’ve been sharing it with all my girlfriends! Can’t wait to see what else this does and update my review to 5 stars! Worth the hype, worth the money!

So I tried the samples I got for a week or two and stopped when it ran out, prepared to forget it like most samples. About a week after I stopped I noticed increased crepe-y-ness on my temples and cheeks. This had been doing something after all and it was only really clear after I stopped. So that's pretty cool. My personal experience is that most OTC skin care anti-aging stuff is placebo effect. Or the changes are so gradual in both directions that I can't objectively tell if it helps. But this makes noteworthy improvement. So even if the molecule is too big, algenist has done some other thing here that helps. I'm actually going to buy a second bottle. My first ran out a few weeks ago and I miss it. Same thing. Stop using it and notice a difference. I hardly ever buy a second bottle of anything."

Secondly, you know how people always say of expensive serum a little goes a long way and you only need a drop? Well, that's often exaggerated, but would be absolute b.s. in this case. You could never spread a drop of this stuff over half a face, let alone face, neck, and chest. I am also skeptical of long term benefits since skin can't absorb topically applied collagen (I read after purchasing). But, and it's a big but, generously applied, this gives the most gorgeous, glowing but non-greasy skin and temporarily plumps and softens fine lines. That is no small feat. It's also a good moisturizer, to the point that if I just want my skin to look amazing under makeup, I can just go in with a cc cream after and skip oil or cream, which is definitely not the norm for my skin. It's a nice primer as well. If you want something for a special event or to use occasionally for going out  (or you just don't mind spending that much on something you'll use up fast), it's worth overcoming the scent and  (my perceived) lack of long term benefits. It looks cool too, like the skincare a mermaid-scientist would use. I probably will not repurchase any time soon, as it's too expensive for me, especially given ny issues with it. Hope that helps!"

I wish they sold this in a 2 liter I seriously would bath in it. The first night. I washed my face, dried it and applied the sample. I had lots of red spots from previous acne, black heads, large pores and a acne that was open on my nose. I’ve been trying to find a product that would correct all this with no luck. Most things either dried my skin or was so oily it irritated it. This I’ve been using for about a week and that sample was amazing. That acne on my nose stopped hurting, the redness really reduced, now I can see my pores closing and blackheads are going. Anytime I pop out a blackhead it irritates my skin, burns and normally breaks me out. Now after I just apply a little on it and it stops hurting and does not inflame and cause acne. This is not cheap but totally worth it. I’m so hooked! My boyfriend after 2 days said to me... wow that stuff is really actually helping your skin. My daughter said... mom that stuff your using is really closing your pores. Your pores are getting so small. I’m also vegan so double win for me!!! Thank you so much for that sample because I would have never tried this because of the price. This is all I use now instead of moisturizer. It’s just enough and doesn’t leave my skin feeling greasy. Thank you for making this product!!! I will be a customer for life!!!"

For me, it seems to smooth and plump my skin, added a softness and clarity, kind of picked up my tired complexion, and it even helped heal a few rough spots and blemishes.

It is never easy for me to have a good serum or cream.This LIQUID COLLAGEN helps my skin more dewy and hydrated. Furthermore, it goes well with other products skincare and good under makeup as well. It doesn;t turn peeling when you use other cream or products on top of it. I have so many product when you combine together and it peels, but this goes well with all of them.

Then I remember I have this algenist liquid collagen tester that I have not opened and I tried. I was just so amazed how the creases kind of disappear right before my eyes. I may sound exaggerated but there's no other way to say it! Take a look at the picture!  I know that a bottle costs $115. So I bought the $80 boxed set to try out the other algenist genius line.

			"review_text": "Before talking of this product, we need to understand what collagen is, and what it does. Collagen is at the base of the dermis. Collagen, think of it as the springs that give the bounciness to the matress that is the dermis. A healthy yougn skin has a ton of collagen, and that results into even skin tone, bounciness, elasticity and firmness.  Now collagen gets broken for many reasons, hormonal changes, pollution, UVA rays. A comprehensive system that protect that collagen and helps repair it is crucial to mainain a younger looking skin. SPF and Vitamin C here are crucial. Still, no matter how much you protect and address the isue exfoliating, protecting, using all the right anti oxidants, theres always going to be room for improvement.  I received my first bottle of this as a gift, and used it as my essence. I already had a comprehensive skincare routine! Then, I got a second bottle...and so carried on using it.. And then one day I noticed the difference. As result of my age, my jaw has started to loose definition. Nothing terrible, but I can notice it! Also my skin , though healthy and beautiful had loss a tad of its usual glow. Now, the glow is back, and people are complimenting my skin much more tan usual, speciall when not wearing any make up. The only thin I have changed is this liquid collagen, so after pondering about, it makes sense that m skin appears firmer and brighter and just so gorgeous. This collagen, unforunately, works.  It is expensive, Sure. Do you must? No, specially if you alreday have a good routine inplace. Would it improve your skin considerably? Yes it would, so if you have some extra cash to spend, go ahead!  Try it.you mugh be really impressed."

Not a product to use if you're often in a hurry.  Anytime I get product in the dropper on the first try, I feel as if I just pulled off a magic trick."

There was no visible changes, so I thought that 7 days was too soon to see results. I tested it another week and took more pictures. Once again nothing noticeable. Finally I said one more week and thats it. After 21 days I reviewed all the pictures and my face looked brighter and smoother before I began using the product. I will be returning this product."

I'll admit, I am taking more time to do my make up- because it's much more fun to do it when you're not trying to hide your skin. I have eczema currently and STILL my skin just looks better.   I use this as directed after cleansing and toning/ essence'ing and let it fully absorb before completing my routine. The directions indicate to use as directed  as a precaution. So.... it may not work otherwise.  It does have an unpleasant smell... to me it smells like deep frying grease... but it dissipates almost immediately. And it could smell like wet dog and I'd still use it. It's just amazing. And I don't think you'd get much out of it unless you had mature skin. Younger women, save your money for preventive skin care. I'm 49 and GENIUS LIQUID COLLAGEN gives skin back its healthy looking thickness and plumpness and youthful healthy look that's beyond what any moisturizer can do."

This works into your ordinary skin care routine easily, and so far is giving me great results--great glow and bounce for my 29 year old skin. I will definitely repurchase this and was pleased with the bottle size for the price. Can't wait to try more products from this line and brand. Love the use of natural/nonharmful ingredients too!!"

Well done, once again, Algenist."
