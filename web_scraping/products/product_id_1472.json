			"review_text": "I am currently going through menopause and therefore my skin is DRY DRY DRY! And dull! I have learned that you don’t have to spend hundreds to get an amazing cream that works and on speaking with dermatologist about creams that had ingredients that were good for your skin they suggested this cream and I have really enjoyed it. It has made my skin feel hydrated and supple without feeling overly greasy or sticky. I love the price point. Peptidwes are really fantastic for your skin at my age when I am losing collagen and moisture. So I am really trying to take care of my skin in a fundamental way to make sure it stays healthy as I go into my 50s. It is also great under makeup. I just make sure to rub it together and warm it up and push it into my skin. I also love the push dispenser instead of a jar which I just find so messy and it gets gross! I would definitely buy this again."

The cream itself is amazing - perfect for winter (when it feels your skin is fighting everything). Very rich and super moisturizing. I happily used the first tub. I bought this cream with a refill and the package stopped working. Have been trying to make it work for months and I have been taking the package apart in order to use it, which feels highly unhygienic. I will not buy this anymore because the whole thing feels gimmicky now. Will stick to regular, non refillable goods from now on. May come back if they change the packaging"

This cream has been a huge help in keeping my skin hydrated and silky, especially during the winter months when I tend to get dry areas. The smoothness of my complexion has significantly improved, and the texture is rich but absorbs easily without feeling greasy. I also really enjoy the pump of the product because I do not have to stick my whole hand into the tub in order to use it.  The price is the one drawback—it's certainly a luxury—but I like that it comes in reusable packaging, which makes it seem a little more environmentally friendly over time. Even though it is more expensive, this moisturizer is worth considering if you're searching for a high-quality product to address dryness and strengthen your skin barrier."

Thanks to a hormonal acne phase (ugh), I’ve been dealing with post-breakout discoloration, plus living in NYC where the weather can’t decide between hot or freezing, which has left my skin parched.  This cream is basically my skin’s BFF right now. It’s hydrating without feeling heavy, which was a major win when I took it to the Dominican Republic. I was worried it might be too much for the heat, but nope—felt lightweight and soothing. Back in NYC it’s still killing it, keeping my skin moisturized even with the wild weather shifts.  The texture is dreamy—plush but not greasy—and the pump? Genius. No waste, no cross contamination, just perfection. I love that it layers like a pro with my actives. My skin feels plumper, smoother, and dare I say, glowier. Also, non-comedogenic for the win because we are NOT inviting acne back.  If your skin barrier needs a reboot, this is it. Clinically proven to work in 30 minutes?? Believe it, because my skin looks and feels healthier after just a few weeks. And hello, refillable pods?! Eco-conscious skincare is a big yes from me.  Skinfix just gets it. Whether you’re battling dryness, discoloration, or just want skin that looks like it’s living its best life—this cream delivers 💧✨"

After opening the product correctly, I pumped a couple times, about 4, to get the product out. The amount of product dispensed is perfect for use and prevents me from using too much. Because the formula is thick and gel like, it really sits on the top layer of the skin and helps keep the skin hydrated. The product itself is white in color, but it blends out evenly without feeling heavy. I will say that when I wash my face the next day, I can feel the product coming off, sort of like an overnight mask. I generally use this product as a layer before my tretinoin and it really helps to give that small protective barrier before I apply my tretinoin, which can be harsh for some people.

No Breakouts: Many rich creams clog my pores, but this one doesn’t. It’s rich but feels surprisingly lightweight, making it perfect even for daytime use under makeup.

Since I started using the Skinfix Barrier Triple-Lipid Peptide Cream my skin started feeling more hydrated, smoother, and even started looking more nourished. It's definitely looking a lot healthier since I started using it because the few dry areas I usually complain about are now soft and moisturized. I’ve struggled with these dry, flaky patches for many years and this cream has really given some of the best results I've seen. It provided me with the long-lasting moisture I seeked.   I also appreciate that Skinfix has a commitment to clean, sustainable ingredients. This cream is made with a blend of ceramides, fatty acids, and peptides. These are all ingredients that focus on restoring and strengthening the skin's barrier.   If you’re seeking an effective moisturizer that will hydrate and repair your skin, while  protecting your skin barrier, I highly recommend giving the Skinfix Barrier Triple-Lipid Peptide Cream a try!"

I have noticed a bit of redness in my cheeks and my skin seems to be drier than usual. I was hoping that this would bring my skin back to life.

One thing I noticed is that I could not wear this under my makeup during the day. Within a few hours my face looked greasy, which is. It something that happened with my previous moisturizer. But, I did like the way it felt on my skin when I used it before bed. When I woke up in the morning, my skin felt  rejuvenated. I have not noticed much of a change in the redness I see in my cheeks but, maybe I need more time with it. One of my favorite things about this product is the packaging. I love the press down pump.

Honestly, you do not need to apply a lot to your face. I have combination skin, so less is more for me. The instructions on the back of the product don’t indicate whether the cream should be applied day and night, so I only apply at night. If I apply in the morning, my skin would feel/look oilier than I like. It’s perfect for night time use.  Even though the cream is fragrance-free, it does have a slightly weird scent to me.

This Triple Lipid-Peptide Cream is an impressive find, standing out as a deeply hydrating face cream designed specifically to restore and support the skin's moisture barrier. It’s formulated with the innovative B-L3™ Complex, which helps to reinforce the skin barrier rapidly—an aspect crucial for those with dryness or environmental sensitivities. It's free from common irritants like fragrance, silicones, parabens, sulfates, and essential oils—some of which can be problematic for sensitive skin. The pH-balanced formula and allergy testing ensure it’s as gentle as it is effective, making it a solid recommendation for a wide range of clients.   I have personally been dealing with dry skin for a while and this product has helped me achieve a radiant, firm, and healthy complexion"

The B-L3 technology and peptides have helped strengthen my skin barrier, which is exactly what I was looking for. I also love that it's refillable, which makes it more sustainable.   The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is the price—it’s on the expensive side. However, considering the quality and the visible results, I think it's worth it, especially for anyone with dry or sensitive skin.

The 2nd thing that made me give it 1 star was the fact that it made me break out, it seemed to make my face too oily and/ or my skin didn't care for what's in it.  I have dry skin normally. The cream didn't feel very heavy or seem to be very oily feeling to the touch but once I rubbed it on my face my skin told me different.

I have been dying to try this for the longest time and let me tell you. It has exceeded my expectations. The formula is incredibly rich and creamy, yet it absorbs quickly without leaving any greasy residue. This is a game-changer for someone like me who has combination skin and often struggles to find a moisturizer that balances hydration without clogging pores. It does have a little bit of a cent to it that I didn’t particularly like, but it’s subsided very quickly after application. One of the standout features of the SkinFix Triple Lipid moisturizer is its unique blend of lipids, which work to restore and strengthen the skin barrier. After just a few days of use, my skin felt noticeably softer, plumper, and more resilient. What impressed me the most is how well it works under makeup. It provides a smooth, hydrated base that helps my foundation glide on effortlessly and stay put throughout the day. Plus, knowing that it’s packed with skin-loving ingredients like ceramides and fatty acids gives me confidence that I’m nourishing my skin with every application. Overall, I’m Super Happy with my experience using the SkinFix Triple Lipid moisturizer. It’s a fantastic addition to my skincare arsenal, and I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a high-quality, effective moisturizer."

I use a lot of acne forward products like retin-a, retinol, salicylic acid, you name it I have probably used it, but of course it can be very drying to my skin. So I always have to a nourishing cream on hand. Of course, my skin being acneic I can't just use anything. For starters, I love the no mess pump of the cream because one full pump is more than plenty to use but also you don't waste any product. The first time trying the cream I used it after my retin-a which I loved because the cream lathers extremely deep and rich. And there is a longevity to the later which allows you to get a nice massage on your face to work in the cream as much as possible. My face felt wonderfully afterwards, but to my dismay the next morning I woke up with a few extra blemishes that I did not go to sleep with. The cream claims to be non-comedoginic, but I'm not sure if my face agreed with it.  I do plan to try at least one more time to rule out if the shea butter and jojoba oil is too much for me. However, if your skin is not acne prone I think it's a really nourishing cream!"

I’ve got fairly sensitive skin, and I’m prone to irritation, especially in colder weather or after shaving. This product has been a lifesaver.  First off, the texture is smooth without being greasy, which I really appreciate. It absorbs quickly and leaves my skin feeling hydrated without any sticky residue. I’ve been using it mostly as a daily moisturizer and noticed a significant improvement in the overall texture of my skin after just a few weeks. My skin feels more resilient, and I haven’t experienced any of the usual dry patches or redness that used to pop up from time to time.  What stands out most is the barrier-repairing aspect. This cream doesn’t just hydrate—it helps to restore the skin’s natural protective barrier, which is key for me since I’m outdoors a lot. The formulation seems gentle but powerful, and it doesn’t irritate my skin like some other creams have in the past.  All in all, Skin Fix Barrier+ is a solid product that’s helped keep my skin healthy and balanced, especially in the colder months. It’s a bit on the pricier side, but given how well it works and the fact that a little goes a long way, I think it’s definitely worth the investment. If you’re looking for a moisturizer that does more than just hydrate and really works to repair and protect your skin, I’d recommend giving this a try."

It provides intense hydration without feeling heavy or greasy, leaving my skin plump and radiant. The blend of lipids and peptides works wonders, visibly improving my skin's texture and firmness.

From the very first use, I fell in love with the dispenser - it's clean, easy to use, and dispenses the perfect amount of product.  What I appreciate most about the cream is its simple, yet effective formula. It's free of fragrances, essential oils, and common irritants like silicones, parabens, and sulfates. Despite its thick, creamy texture, the formula absorbs quickly, leaving my skin feeling softer, plumper, and more hydrated.  After just a few days of consistent use, I noticed my skin was noticeably smoother. And within a week, I was amazed by how even and radiant my complexion looked, even with makeup on. The clean, potent ingredients seem to work in perfect harmony to nourish and revitalize the skin.  Overall, I would wholeheartedly recommend this product to anyone looking for an effective, no-frills moisturizer that delivers real results.

This cream has quickly established itself as a must-have in my skincare lineup.   From the moment I first applied it, I was struck by its luxurious texture. The cream spreads effortlessly across my skin, and I appreciate how quickly it absorbs. Unlike some creams that leave a greasy film, this one has a lightweight feel that makes it perfect for daily wear, whether I'm applying it in the morning before makeup or in the evening as part of my nighttime skincare routine. It provides just the right amount of hydration without weighing my skin down.  Another aspect I really appreciate is its fragrance-free formula. For those of us with sensitive skin or simply a preference for fragrance-free products, this is a significant advantage. It allows me to layer the cream with other skincare products, such as serums or oils, without the concern of any conflicting scents.  The packaging is another highlight worth mentioning. The container is beautifully designed, giving it an elegant, high-end feel that looks great on my vanity. The pump dispenser is not just stylish; it’s also incredibly practical. It dispenses just the right amount of product with each pump, minimizing waste and ensuring that I’m using the right portion every time.  As I continued to use this cream, I noticed improvements in my skin's overall texture and hydration levels. It feels plumper and more supple, which is something I’ve been striving for in my skincare routine. The added benefit of peptides also gives me confidence that I’m supporting my skin’s barrier function and overall health.  Overall, my experience with SkinFix Barrier+ Triple Lipid Peptide Cream has been overwhelmingly positive. Its non-greasy finish, luxurious feel, and effective hydration make it an excellent choice for anyone loo"

That pretty much sums up my skin and after using the Skinfix Barrier+ Triple Lipid-Peptide Cream my skin is less red and feels very comfortable. The packaging is one where you press down to get your product out. I have mixed feelings about that delivery system. I never seem to get the same amount of moisturizer each time. On the other hand it is refillable so it will be up to you to decide if it’s your thing. The product itself is incredible. It glides across my face. It’s is very hydrating but not so heavy that I’m greasy. You can use it morning and night. My skin drinks it up every morning and I’m thrilled with the end results. The Skinfix Barrier+ Triple Lipid-Peptide Cream is Vegan and Cruelty Free so it’s a full of good, effective ingredients and none of the bad stuff.

They were the first brand I tried when I was looking for a peptide moisturizer after seeing raving reviews about it everywhere online! I absolutely adore this product for a few reasons. The first being the refillable packaging. This is such a huge win for the environment and for the user, as you are able to purchase refills for less than purchasing the product brand new each time you’re finished with it. Another reason I love this product is because of how rich the moisturizer is. If you live in a climate where you need the extra barrier protection, this product is for you. The formula is incredible, filled with Skinfix’s custom blend of B-L3 Barrier Lipid Complex, Natripeptide Blend and Hydrating Glycerin. This blend is amazing for plumping the skin, combating fine lines and wrinkles, dryness and loss of firmness and elasticity. This will leave your skin feeling plump and I absolutely love how it feels on the skin after applying the product. I love that you can feel the hydration even after an hour of applying, yet if you choose to use this under your makeup in the morning, it won’t pill or negatively affect your makeup. This is such a gorgeous product that I will be using over and over again in my routine. This is also the product I recommend to friends who are looking for skincare or for a great moisturizer. This would make a great gift and they have a few gift sets of the different formulas which are amazing too! Highly recommend this if you’re looking for a phenomenal moisturizer!"

One pump delivers the perfect amount for my face and neck of a thick, creamy unscented goodness.  The spread is luxurious and it does take a few minutes to set, seems a tad heavy and greasy at first.  After a couple minutes, it is the perfect base for makeup.  No pilling with sunscreen or any of the serums I have tried with it or makeup.  Winner winner chicken dinner on the plump and glowy skin it gives me.  My skin was hydrated all day long and after a few days, I notices every blemish I had healing really fast and I have had no breakouts since.  That is a miracle for me with a new thick moisturizer which usually will bring up a couple deep demons in the form of acne on my chin or cheeks.  Even my texture has improved over the last week I have been testing this formula for my honest opinion.  Skinfix is the real deal if your barrier is suffering or if you are just looking for a new day or nightcream.

This cream really moisturizes and my skin stays hydrated for hours.

My skin felt very moisturized immediately after applying and stayed feeling hydrated as well. Most creams that are rich and hydrating end up causing me to break out and experience pimples and clogged pores. However, this one did not do that. I am not sure if this will become an issue over time, but for now it has not caused me to break out so far. I like that it doesn’t really have a scent either. This is great for me. Also, fragrances can sometimes cause me reactions so I really like that this one does not. I think this moisturizer would work for most people. It is a nice unisex product. I will continue to use this product."

It's very thick and does leave a slight residue/tackiness for a few minutes as it absorbs into the skin. I just love how protected I feel with this on my face!   I have used it morning and night for a 7 day period so far - no clogged pores or breakouts for me. No redness, irritation, or dry patches. I love how gentle and nourishing this peptide formula is. I also love the dispensing mechanism - you press down on the lid and a perfect dollop of cream comes out. A little goes a long way! I am delighted to continue using this product because I think it will keep my skin barrier happy and strong all winter long.  It is pricey, but like I said before, a little goes a long way.

I was curious to try this cream because it claims to target dehydration, nourish skin, improve skin barrier, and help skin recover from environmental stressors like toxins, sun damage, and pollution. I must admit, my skin is tired lately and needs extra nourishment during the colder months. This cream did not disappoint, the texture is dreamy, it is so creamy and lightweight, it feels deeply moisturizing, and instant dryness relief is guaranteed! The cream does not make my combo skin look greasy or oily, my skin looks radiant, but in a natural way. Let me mention it again, the formula is dreamy, it instantly soothes my skin, and deeply moisturized skin is a great base for any makeup! I absolutely like how it makes my skin feel and look, it does provide long-lasting moisturizing and keeps my skin comfortable when it is cold outside. No irritation, nothing to complain about, actually."

The Skinfix Barrier+ Triple Lipid-Peptide Cream also makes for an excellent canvas before applying makeup. My other dry skin girlies know that we suffer from patchiness on application without solid skincare prep. After prepping, I had no patchiness from my foundation. It played great with the rest of my makeup routine and I experienced no pilling. So not only does this cream hydrate my super dry skin, but it also performs like a champ under my makeup. Amazing, right??  Finally, I absolutely love that the jar is refillable. This scores major points from a sustainability aspect as I hate having to contribute to landfill with my skincare regime.

Brands don't last that long unless they're doing something right. The barrier cream has four different actives and protects your skin from the products you put on top, yet it works with retinol and vitamin C products. It deeply moisturizes and helps with plumping out the skin and diminishes the look of fine lines and wrinkles. Its great for maturing skin. It has a nice thick consistency yet absorbs well, leaving your skin nice and soft. Just to make it a little bit better they made the special pump jar refillable."

			"review_text": "I haven't tried the original version so I can't say how it was different from this new reformulation. The texture is more like a typical lotion than most moisturizers, not at all gel-like but kind of thick. It spreads easily over the skin. No added fragrance or essential oils, so it smells just like generic lotion, not especially nice but not terrible (if it does tbh I'd guess it's gone rancid).  I have very dry, acne-prone skin. Unfortunately, it doesn't soak in very well when I use it on my face. When I first apply it, I can literally see everywhere it is on my skin because it just looks like I'm spreading a thin layer of white all over. It takes a while for it to soak in enough to not leave such a noticeable cast. Even after giving it that time though, it leaves me looking pretty shiny and greasy. Weirdly, it works great and doesn't have any sort of greasy cast on my neck and hands, so it might be that my face is just too dehydrated for this formula to absorb properly.  It stung slightly on application and I did feel like my face was a bit redder initially, but I started using tretinoin pretty recently so that is likely the reason, but something to be aware of if you have a damaged barrier or otherwise very dry skin.  It also reacts with certain other products when layering--on top of some of my serums,  it just dried in a thin mask on my skin--I literally could peel off the layer of moisturizer. On bare skin it doesn't do this at least, but still, the shine factor is a bit much.  It's moderately moisturizing, not hugely so, and I've tried other products that didn't have the greasiness, so I'll probably not stick with this product except to finish it up, but I think it would work well for someone with normal to only slightly dry skin that's sensitive to things like added fragrance."

			"review_text": "If you’re looking for a skincare product that truly delivers on its promises, the Skinfix Triple Lipid-Peptide Cream is a game-changer. As someone who’s tested a multitude of moisturizers claiming to nourish and rejuvenate skin, I found this cream to exceed my expectations. In this review, I’ll cover everything from texture and application to the scent and the remarkable benefits this product has on my skin. Let’s dive into what makes this cream such a standout in my routine.  Texture and Feel - First and foremost, the texture of this cream is exquisite. It’s thick and rich yet surprisingly lightweight upon application. When I first scooped a small amount out of the jar, I was initially worried that it might feel heavy or greasy. But as soon as I applied it to my skin, it melted in beautifully without leaving a greasy residue. It’s deeply moisturizing but doesn’t sit on top of the skin like some other thick creams tend to do. Instead, it absorbs quickly, leaving my face feeling plump and hydrated without any unpleasant stickiness. For anyone with dry skin, this cream will likely feel like a comforting, thirst-quenching layer.  Scent - One of my favorite things about Skinfix Triple Lipid-Peptide Cream is the lack of a strong, overpowering scent. It’s virtually fragrance-free, which is ideal for anyone with sensitive skin or those who prefer not to have lingering scents on their face. You might pick up a faint, natural smell that’s almost undetectable, which I think speaks to the brand’s commitment to using clean, gentle ingredients. There’s no added fragrance, which I find refreshing and a nice change from other products that use perfumes or artificial scents. This makes it an especially suitable choice for those who are sensitive to fragrances or who appreciate a more minimalist approach in skincare.  Application and Absorption - Applying this cream is a pleasure—it glides on effortlessly and spreads evenly across the skin."

Pros: - I have sensitive skin and it hasn't irritated it at all. - It is fragrance free and has no parabens or alcohol. - It's a well-aging product that can be used by people like me who don't use retinoids (though you can also use it with retinoids). - It layers well with other products and sinks into the skin fine. - It provides a good occlusive barrier to seal in any products I apply beforehand. - Restores skin's natural lips and prevents TEWL (trans epidermal water loss), so it's good for dry skin. - It has clean ingredients that are also active (I'd call it cleanical) - Contains peptides but doesn't contain the peptides that *anecdotally* have caused sagging in some people (aka it has no argireline or copper peptides). - I'm a sucker for the cute blue tub. - I love the hygienic pump type tub container. - Replacement pods are available for purchase.  Cons: - Like almost all Western beauty products, it contains phenoxyethanol, which is used as a preservative. - Depending on your budget, this product may be a bit pricey (though not any more pricey than other higher end moisturizers). - It has a very mild fermented smell which I personally don't mind, but if you're into perfumed skincare you may not be as into it."

This rich, yet non-greasy cream is formulated with a powerful blend of three key lipids—ceramides, fatty acids, and cholesterol—along with peptides to promote skin health and resilience.

Overall, Skinfix Barrier+ Triple Lipid-Peptide Cream delivers on its promise to repair and strengthen the skin barrier, providing long-lasting hydration, a smoother texture, and a more resilient skin surface.

I did enjoy the “pump” and feel it kept me from using way more than I need to which typically happens a lot for me. I do have a few things I don’t like, firstly I feel like the scent is pretty over bearing and kind of reminds me of a low end skin care line I own. For the price of this I feel there should be no scent at all as it is advertising there is not, or something more pleasant. I also don’t like that even though the packaging makes it appear there is a ton of product it’s mostly just in a small pot within the packaging itself, which is totally fine I just feel like it is a tad misleading. I’m aware that it has the amount on the box it comes in and on the item itself but I feel it’s truly a waste of packaging by leaving that much empty.

As the weather has gotten colder, my skin has become increasingly dry, but this cream has made a significant difference.  One of the first things I noticed about this moisturizer is its texture. It’s a thicker cream, which I find perfect for providing that extra layer of hydration my skin needs during the colder months. Despite its consistency, it absorbs well into the skin without leaving a greasy residue, which is a huge plus for me. I can apply it in the morning and not worry about it interfering with my makeup or making my skin look shiny throughout the day.

My skin feels plumper which is something I haven’t experienced with other moisturizers that I’ve tried.  Another reason I love about this cream is that it’s refillable. In today’s world, it’s great to see a product that aligns with my efforts to be more environmentally conscious. The packaging is sleek and easy to use, and I appreciate that I can just buy a refill instead of a whole new jar. This not only reduces waste but also makes the product more cost-effective in the long run.  The cream also has a pleasant, subtle scent that isn’t overpowering. I have sensitive skin, and I’m always cautious about products with strong fragrances, but this one is gentle and hasn’t caused any irritation. It’s a relief to find a product that is both effective and gentle on my skin.  Overall, I highly recommend the Skinfix Barrier Cream to anyone looking for a deeply hydrating moisturizer, especially if you have dry or sensitive skin. I can’t imagine going through the colder months without it.  **This review was collected as part of a promotion"

			"review_text": "After using the Skinfix Triple Lipid-Peptide Cream for a week, I have mixed feelings. Let me break it down:  First, the scent. To me, it reminds me of Playdoh, which is a bit odd for a skincare product. My husband, however, thinks it smells floral, so it's one of those scents that might vary depending on who's sniffing. It's not overpowering, but it’s noticeable.  As for the texture, it’s a bit tackier than I prefer in a cream. It leaves my skin feeling slightly sticky, which isn’t ideal if you're looking for something that absorbs quickly. However, I found that layering it over a hydrating serum helped mitigate the tackiness and made it more comfortable to wear.  The pump is another story. It reminds me a lot of Drunk Elephant’s packaging, which gives off a playful, almost childlike vibe. While I appreciate the hygienic nature of a pump, it can be tricky to control how much product you dispense. I’ve ended up with more than I need a few times, which is frustrating since the cream is on the richer side and a little goes a long way.  Now, let’s talk about the results. I’ve been using this for about a week, and while I enjoy the texture and feel of the cream, I haven’t seen the dramatic results I was expecting, especially given how much I love the Skinfix undereye cream. That product worked wonders for me, so I had high hopes for this one. I do acknowledge, though, that it might take longer than a week to see significant results.  Overall, I like the cream, but I’m not blown away just yet. I’ll keep using it and see if it delivers more as time goes on, but for now, I’m not sure it’s quite living up to the Skinfix standard I was hoping for."

This luxurious moisturizer has become an indispensable part of my daily routine, and I'm here to sing its praises. The first thing that struck me about this cream is its rich, velvety texture. It feels incredibly nourishing on the skin, without being heavy or greasy. It's everything my face needs, especially during the colder months. One of the most significant benefits I've experienced is the improvement in my skin's overall texture and tone. The cream has a remarkable ability to plump up fine lines and wrinkles, leaving my skin looking smoother and more youthful. It also has a calming effect on my sensitive skin, reducing redness and irritation. What I truly appreciate about this product is its fragrance-free formulation. As someone with sensitive skin, I often react to scented products. Skinfix Barrier+ is completely scentless, making it ideal for me.  The innovative airless pump dispenser is another plus. It ensures hygienic application and prevents contamination. This is especially important for those of us who are concerned about bacterial growth in skincare products. I've found that using this cream in the morning, after applying retinol, is a perfect combination. The rich, nourishing formula helps to soothe any potential irritation caused by the retinol and provides a protective barrier against environmental stressors."

			"review_text": "The Skinfix Triple Lipid-Peptide Cream is a  hydrating moisturizer that has restored my skin’s moisture  while delivering a boost of essential nutrients.Its formula contains  active ingredients like ceramides, fatty acids, and  triple lipid complex. One of the nice things of this moisturizer is its rich, creamy texture that melts effortlessly into the skin without leaving a heavy or greasy residue. This makes it suitable for both day and night use, mostly for all skin types. I have a combination to dry skin type. On application, the cream provides an immediate sense of relief to dry or irritated skin, leaving it feeling soft, plump, and noticeably more comfortable. It provides a significant improvement in skin hydration and texture after just a few uses, with ongoing benefits such as smoother, firmer skin and a reduction in fine lines. The formula is fragrance-free which is good for me, since I have sensitivities to scent, and it’s dermatologist-tested, cruelty-free, and vegan. Ideal for skin types ranging from normal to extremely dry, the Skinfix Triple Lipid-Peptide Cream offers both immediate and long-term benefits. I would highly recommend this moisturizer as it provides good results."

I love that this product doesn't contain any fragrances and that's it's vegan. It's keeps my skin smooth and hydrated. A single pump goes a very long way. This gives an all day hydration with the seaweed hyaluronate blend and lily extract. My skin looks very supple and smooth. I have normal to oily skin however I could get very dehydrated. This product is great even with my oily skin, it doesn't make me look anymore shiner throughout the day. As I have been using it night and day. Definitely a product i recommend.

This moisturizer by Skin Fix is the perfect formula for someone who wants the moisture but doesn’t want a thick and heavy consistency feeling on their skin. The packaging is so practical and easy to throw into my skincare bag anywhere I travel to. I found the I didn’t need to reapply this moisturizer throughout the day, which is great because most moisturizers that are thin and not hydrating enough.

I suffer from drier/dehydrated skin due from both internal factors and the use for vitamin A serums.  It is normal to have flaky skin when using vitamin a and I was experiencing that when I found this amazing product.  After one use at night I felt more hydrated and calmed with my skin.  After just a couple uses day and night I felt the right amount of hydration on my skin.  What is unique and great about this product that is designed to work well with Vitamin A and other resurfacing products.  Perfect combo!  Highly recommend for anyone looking for a little extra help during the anti-aging journey.  Also good for those with natural barrier issues."

I have lost count of how many awful scented products have given me a migraine. Skincare companies really need to stop adding fragrance to their products. It's a turn off.  The texture is thick but does not feel thick or greasy on my face. I can feel my face soaking in the moisture. Since I turned 40 this past summer I started to notice little lines on my forehead.

I’ve used the triple lipid peptide cream for three consecutive nights thus far and truly love the results I’m seeing. As I age, I’m noticing some forehead lines creeping in and the fact that my skin leans towards the dry side doesn’t help. So with the use of this cream I’ve noticed that when I wake up in the morning the forehead lines aren’t as visible thanks to the deep hydration offered by this cream. It’s thick and ultra moisturizing. It leaves my skin soft like a baby.

I love that it’s fragrance-free, which is a huge plus for my sensitive skin. It’s so hard to find a good unscented cream these days! It also works well under makeup; my foundation and concealer still look great with it underneath. Just a heads-up, though—it’s not meant to extend the wear of your makeup.

This rich yet lightweight formula melts into my skin, giving it instant hydration and plumpness. I have combination skin, so my T-zone area tends to be drier, so I suddenly felt it smoother, softer, and well-balanced after the first application. The standout benefit of this cream is the lipid-peptide blend that has helped strengthen my skin barrier by locking in moisture to prevent moisture loss, especially as it is getting into the colder months.  This fragrance-free cream has given me a healthy glow, lessened fine lines, and deep hydration that I can’t stop looking in the mirror. I like that this product doesn’t irritate my sensitive eyes and skin while not clogging my acne-prone pores. So, it works great as a base before I apply my makeup, giving my skin a beautiful radiance. Even though it is on the pricey side, it is worth the investment into my daily skincare routine to continue to achieve more resilient skin and superb hydration."

It has a push down top that only releases a pea size amount of the lotion which is nice because you don’t have to worry about accidentally releasing more than you wanted to at once. I really don’t have any real complaints but if I had to come up with one it would be that’s it’s unscented which could also be a plus for someone else. I just thought it could have had a hint of a nice smell. It’s recommended to use along side your face serums like vitamin c or retinol. I used it with my retinol and I really liked it. This would be a safe product for sensitive skin types. I have dry skin so I use serums and lotions in the morning together, I would think this is light enough for oily skin as well."

There’s a slight smell but it just reminded me of oil, like sunflower or jojoba oil. It’s not the most lightweight moisturizer but I’m not complaining because I have combo skin and the drier areas soak it up.   The feeling it gave me was silky skin for hours, I slept in it and my skin was still soft and glowy but not greasy even in my oily areas. A little bit goes a long way, I’d say 1-2 pumps max. This would be great if you have dry skin/combo skin or it’s getting colder and you’re in need of something good and have the money to spend.   This didn’t break me out but as always patch test before using on your entire face."

I had always wondered what the hype was. Now I know. This tri-lipid peptide cream feels so extremely comforting, non-irritating, and hydrating to my skin. It almost leaves a balm-like feel to my skin, even though it’s a cream. I’ll put it on at night and in the morning, I can still feel it actively hydrating my skin and neck. You can literally feel the change skin moisturization from the areas where you put it on, and where you don’t- even 24 hours later. It’s really like a hydrating and balmy barrier. I think the best part is it doesn’t feel sticky or greasy like an oil or balm. It just feels like it really settles into my skin and plumps, without making my face look oily. I’ve even made my boyfriend try it as he has sensitive skin, and he liked it too. I can definitely see why this is a cult favorite and I am now totally part of the hype!

I am a brand partner and have worked in the cosmetics industry since 2015, so I have tried a lot of the brands carried in Ulta and Sephoras. And let me just say, I am super picky about what moisturizer I use, since I usually wear makeup 5 days out of the week. I need a moisturizer that absorbs quick, is light weight and doesn’t leave a residue/layer behind. This moisturizer is great for someone who has dry/sensitive skin, because it’s a cream that gives a lot of hydrating but doesn’t feel heavy or oily. I have been loving using this before I do my makeup. It’s been great at keeping my skin balanced/strengthened and hydrated. I highly recommend, again especially for someone who is sensitive, since it has no fragrance."

As someone with normal skin that gets dehydrated often as I live in a very dry climate I was excited to try this product. This is my first trying this triple lipid peptide cream and wanted so much for this to be a nightly cream that would be able to keep my skin hydrated over night. After 2 weeks of use at night I found it better as a day cream because of how quickly it absorbs into my skin leaving it hydrated but not feeling greasy or heavy.  I prioritize skincare products that provide intense hydration without clogging pores or causing breakouts. From the first application, I noticed the cream’s rich yet non-greasy texture. It absorbed quickly, leaving my skin feeling deeply nourished and comfortable. After a week, the dryness around the edges of my face has significantly reduced, with no signs of flakiness or irritation. I have not noticed a significant improvement in my skin's texture and plumpness of my skin yet but I will continue using daily with my morning skincare regimen. I like to use this product and follow it with a tinted SPF which helps to keep my skin looking hydrated. This review was collected as part of a promotion."

Value: While it is positioned at a mid-to-high price point, the effectiveness of the formulation justifies the investment. A little goes a long way, and given the quality of the ingredients, it feels like a worthwhile splurge for anyone serious about maintaining skin."

My skin was getting better with my routine, but it wasnt until I added this cream that I saw a truly amazing difference! My skin is softer, less dull and tired looking, and radiant. Not to mention baby skin smooth. It's a thicker cream until you rub it in. I've never had a cream that's on the heavy side absorb so quick and easy into the skin. It's absorbs quick and there is absolutely no grease look or feel left behind! I cannot recommend this cream enough. My daughter with sensitive skin can even use it!"

I got so many compliments at work about the shine that was glowing in my face. I recommend using this product as if you need a hydration and glow look. This product is the one to give you just that! The moisture that is felt on my skin after use is amazing. I feel like it gives my skin the best hydration it is needed. Now it’s fall time and we all need some hydration to our skin and this product is the one to give you just that. I am on week 2 now and it is giving me the same results as the previous week, super nice hydration, shine and glow. I walked to get some coffee and I was stop several time as the sun was hitting my face. When that happens my skin glow even more. I was so happy that people noticed it. So again, if you are looking for a nice hydration and shine this item is the perfect one for you. I also would recommend this item as a great holiday gift or birthday gift to a friend or family member. Its is super nice size to add to a stocking cap during the holidays. It would fit inside of your cabinet in the bathroom for easy access when needing to use it. Let’s talk about how the packaging and the outer look of the item. The package is nice and blue but the item itself is so compact with a twist off for opening to replace the one that’s empty. Super nice and easy to replace when needed. I like the top part as you will need to press down slightly to retrieve the contents inside and using one or two push’s you will receive enough of the product to place on your face. It has a secured top as well to keep the contents secure and safe without it drying out. If you prefer to use this while doing your face regiment in the shower. This item can go in a nice spot with your other shower essentials easily without causing a clutter issue. You will love thisThis review was collected as part of a promotion"

This one was no different, and has actually become my favorite SkinFix product thus far.  If you've tried the Triple Lipid-Peptide Cream in the past, this is the new and improved version. After cleansing, apply two finger tip amounts to your face and neck, and gently massage in. It really does only require this small amount to be effective, so this will last awhile.   My skin is IMMEDIATELY left feeling so soft, moisturized, and has the most beautiful radiant glow. To get the most benefits out of this product, use it in conjunction with your favorite vitamin C, retinol, or exfoliating acid products for that extra added barrier support.   This would be best recommended for those that suffer from dry or dehydrated skin, but can also be used for those with combo skin like myself. I look forward to seeing my long term results, and will absolutely recommend this brand to literally anyone."

There is no need to dip fingers or use a spatula . There wasn’t any noticeable fragrance to this cream which I prefer for my sensitive skin. My skin has been so dry recently and I noticed this cream has a deeply rich texture. After applying the peptide rich cream my skin feels soft and looks healthy. This was good for my morning routine. I applied this rich peptide cream and noticed it took a few minutes to fully absorb for a non greasy smooth finish. I can recommend this cream to anyone who needs to repair their skin barrier.

But this one doesn't do that so I'm very pleased. Also I like that the packaging is a twistable so it's easier to keep everything clean and hygienic."

I was desperate for something to calm it down, and since incorporating this cream into my nightly routine (before applying tretinoin), my skin has made a complete turnaround. The redness is gone, the irritation has faded, and my barrier feels so much stronger. I have combination-oily skin, which is tricky to manage, but this cream strikes the perfect balance. It hydrates my dry cheeks while keeping my oily T-zone under control, all without clogging my pores or feeling greasy on my acne-prone skin. The texture is rich and creamy but absorbs fast, and I love that it’s fragrance-free, making it perfect for sensitive skin. Another standout feature is the refillable jar—it makes it easy to dispense just the right amount every time. Honestly, this cream has become a staple in my routine, and I’ll be repurchasing it as soon as I run out. If you’re dealing with a compromised skin barrier, this is an absolute must-have!"

I wore this all day for my 8 hr. shift which consisted of working with kids as a physical therapist and I came home with a nonoily/shiny-looking face. I was so surprised with the results that same day. I attempted another day, just in case it was pure luck. Nope, the product is that great. And by the way, I live in sunny, humid Florida.

No other products in my routine were different, just this product refill. Immediately upon using, I experienced severe irritation including redness, skin pain, dryness, itchy skin, and a horrible breakout. I returned the product, kept my face bare for a few days and went back to using only my Bobbi Brown skincare products that I've sworn by since my early 30s and all of the irritation disappeared within a week.

The whiteheads weren't visibly obvious if you weren't looking for them, but I could feel the rough and bumpy texture they created on my cheeks. I substituted my usual moisturizer for this one while still using my usual toners and serums so perhaps it just doesn't play well with other skincare formulas and should be used alone.

I currently struggle with sensitive combination dry/oily skin that is also showing new signs of aging, so finding the right moisturizer for all of my concerns has been difficult. Skinfix barrier+ Strengthening and Moisturizing Triple Lipid-Peptide Cream has been such a fantastic find for my skin care. The moisturizer feels devine going onto my skin, it’s not too think not too thin, and absorbs naturally. It doesn’t leave the skin feeling greasy or heavy even after a heavier nighttime application. The red blotchiness of my skin has lessened and the dry patches have softened. My face feels so soft, supple, and rejuvenated after use. I am in love!! The one singular thing preventing this product from having a five star rating is the smell. I really really wish I smelt better, a dab of essential oil would have gone a long way."

This is a good cream if you like going without makeup; it has a primer-like blurring effect and my favorite part is that it pairs well with actives such as retinol, AHA, BHA, vitamin C, etc. After a week's use of this cream, I noticed an improvement mainly in my skin's bounciness and firmness - it is more plump, radiant, and younger looking."

As someone with combination skin—dry on the periphery and oily in the T-zone—finding a moisturizer that addresses both areas effectively is a challenge. At 31, I prioritize skincare products that provide intense hydration without clogging pores or causing breakouts in my oily zones.  From the first application, I noticed the cream’s rich yet non-greasy texture. It absorbed quickly, leaving my skin feeling deeply nourished and comfortable. After a week, the dryness around the edges of my face has significantly reduced, with no signs of flakiness or irritation. My T-zone also seems more balanced, with less oiliness throughout the day. This is a rare benefit for me, as many heavy creams can exacerbate my oily areas. I also noticed an overall improvement in the texture and plumpness of my skin, giving it a healthy, radiant look.

You also get use to the smell after a few uses, and it doesn’t bother you anymore.

I have been using the SKINFIX barrier+ Strengthening and Moisturizing Triple Lipid-Peptide Cream as my sole moisturizer for about a week now and have had an overall meh experience using it.  Let's start with the packaging, which is my favorite aspect of this product. The refillable feature of this product is a huge plus. I also loved the pump design! It allows you to get the same amount of product each time and is a clean way to swipe up the product. Unfortunately, in my experience, the impressive appearance didn't translate into a satisfying experience with the product itself.  I have normal skin and apply moisturizer daily. I switched to this moisturizer and after a week, I found that my skin did not feel truly moisturized. Instead of the expected hydrated glow, my face felt somewhat tight and lacked the plumpness that I associate with effective moisturizers I've used in the past. My skin also started to break out, which was unexpected.   While the SKINFIX barrier+ Strengthening and Moisturizing Triple Lipid-Peptide Cream wins points for its unique packaging, the adverse effects and lack of hydration makes it hard for me to recommend this moisturizer to everyone."

It's soothing to apply and leaves my skin hydrated and feeling plump. I will definitely repurchase this and continue to use it, my skin is so happy! Overall, this is another great product from Skinfix and the ingredients make me think I'll see better results long-term."

Skinfix Triple Lipid-Peptide Cream is a standout choice that checks all the boxes.  First and foremost, this cream is vegan, cruelty-free, and free from parabens, making it a great option for ethically conscious consumers. It’s refreshing to find a moisturizer that combines high-quality ingredients without the harmful and unnecessary additives.  What sets this cream apart is its impressive formulation. Similar to the high-end and very expenisve SkinCeuticals Triple Lipid moisturizer, Skinfix offers comparable benefits at a much more affordable price point. The rich texture provides deep hydration, which is especially essential during the winter months. It helps maintain the skin barrier while delivering the anti-aging benefits of peptides, promoting firmer and more radiant skin.  The airless pump jar is another thoughtful feature, ensuring you get the perfect amount of product without waste. Application is smooth and satisfying; it absorbs slowly and does leave a slightly greasy residue because it is lipids, I would recommend using this moisturizer at night.  After using for two weeks I’ve found that my skin has made visible improvements in textur, hydration and residence with continued use. Skinfix Triple Lipid-Peptide Cream is an excellent choice for anyone seeking a luxurious, effective moisturizer that won’t break the bank. Your skin will thank you!"

This packaging for one is extremely easy to use as you simply press down to release some cream, and you wipe it with your fingers to pick it up. It dispenses just the right amount for my face. This cream has made my skin a lot more hydrated which is due to the peptides and lipid complex. Since I use the sandwiching method when using retinoids, I like to use a cream like this one as my last step to make sure my skin is not irritated in the morning. I sometimes even like to use this on nights I do not use retinoids as I have come to learn that keeping your skin barrier healthy and moisturized is especially important. My husband has also seen a vast improvement in his dry skin and has even now looked at the Skinfix line to see what else they offer. No matter your skin type I would suggest this to everyone"

First, sanitary... air doesn't interact with and change the formula and second, I don't overuse the product.   Skinfix Barrier+ repairs the skin barrier and plumps skin with a compound combining lipids, vitamins, and five signal peptides - which are kind of like the ingredient of the moment in skincare!

I was able to overlook it after a couple of days of using this cream, but it very much reminds me of the smell of inflatable swimming pool toys and floats.  It was off putting at first, but I got used to it quickly.  Also, this product sits very heavily on your skin and takes a while to completely absorb into your skin.  It leaves a bit of an oily residue for a good amount of time, so that is something to be aware of if you are wanting to wear it under makeup. I did experience a few blemishes after a week of daily use, but they were easily covered up. I will say that after just a few days of using this cream, my facial skin was smooth and well hydrated.  I really like the pump dispenser and not having to get product beneath my nails to apply it. It also keeps the product from becoming contaminated since you don't have to dig into it with your fingers.   I also appreciate that this container is refillable, keeping additional plastic out of our landfills. Overall, I would recommend this product to anyone in need of deep moisturizing on their face.

This face cream is made with 3% healthy skin lipid complex that helps replenish and restore depleted lipids. 5% Glycerin, that locks moisture into the skin, 3% netripeptides that support skin barrier health, 3.5% seaweed sodium hyaluronate blend that deeply hydrates, and lily root that helps lock hydration into the skin. With these four ingredients, it makes this the most hydrating face cream I have ever tried. It's lightweight on the skin and doesn't leave behind a sticky or oily feeling. It's great for all skin types, even sensitive skin! This face cream is also great for premature aging skin with seven times the plumping effect. It can also help with breakouts. It's clean and clinically proven to work. It's even dermatologist recommended. I love how the applicator only dispenses what you need. It's easy to apply and absorbs quickly into the skin. It's also free of added fragrance, sulfates, parabens, and also vegan and cruelty-free. It's gentle on the skin. With all of these great things this is why this face cream will remain my favorite!"

			"review_text": "I can say with certainty that my skin barrier appears visibly improved, so this product delivers on its promise.  I was using this for few days before I realized that it reminded me of another more expensive product that I liked. I think this is very similar to the Kate Somerville Peptide K8 Power Cream. Unlike the K8 this is unscented, vegan and cruelty free. The packing is very similar too but the Skinfix Barrier+ is a 50ml jar while the K8 is only 30ml.  It’s also eco-friendly as you can buy refills for the container.  There is also a huge price difference, Skinfix Barrier+ is a third of the price of the K8.  Both products contain lipids, antioxidants, hyaluronic acid, and shea butter; but the Skinfix Barrier+ comes at a better value.   Overall, Skinfix Barrier+ is a winner.  It has a thick consistency that rapidly moisturizes and plumps the skin. Upon first use, I immediately noticed a difference in the smoothness of my skin.  After five days, of use my skin felt firmer and more supple. I even noticed that the fine lines around my eyes seemed less visible. This is a great moisturizer for those winter months when my skin gets super dry.   I have sensitive skin, so I use this at night after I apply my retinol cream which normally can cause me irritation.   Since using the SkinFix, I have noticed that I no longer have that irritation from my retinol.  Using this product at night has made my makeup application during the day easier and has given my skin freshness that I haven’t seen since my 20s.  Skinfix Barrier+ will remain a staple in my skin care routine!"

I applied this after my shower and immediately felt my skin go from tight dryness to a firm supple moisturized glow. There were no negative side effects, just true moisture. I have been using SkinFix barrier+ for 6 days now, morning and night. My skin has truly drank up all the nutrients this product offers and I’m left with bright, plump skin.

			"review_text": "Okay sooo let me start by saying I have sensitive acne prone (hormonal cystic acne) combination skin. My T-zone is oily but the rest of my face is dehydrated, and i also have eczema. The first product I tried from skinfix was the eczema body wash and I loved it and I’m still using it. This cream is advertised as a thicker cream which I was skeptical of trying because of my skin type/issues. Well I LOVED it. I tend to reach for thinner, gel/water moisturizers so this was definitely a change but the way my skin soaked this up and was literally glowing after every use! The packaging is awesome because you don’t need a lot of product, a little really does go a long way. I also love that it’s refillable so instead of purchasing a whole new one, I can get the refill and save some coin. This cream didn’t make my skin breakout or irritate it in any way. It’s fragrance free and tested/recommended by independent dermatologists which I love that tidbit of info! My skin didn’t feel heavy or greasy, just absolutely moisturized and glowing! I always thought because I have combination skin that I couldn’t use a thicker cream like this but I’m really glad I tried it because I’ll probably never go back. It’s been a week and my dry patches are starting to clear up. I also used this on my elbows where my eczema flares up and it worked just as well on that too. If you have extremely oily skin that’s not from dehydration I don’t think this would be up your alley, but every other skin type could definitely benefit from this product. The price is the only thing that could improve with this product. I wish it was more affordable/budget friendly so more people could try it. If you have the money to try this cream, it really does last a long time because you don’t need much product for your face. It is worth the change you’ll see in your skin in just a few days.  Skinfix… you’ve done it again! I can’t wait to try this whole skincare line."

I have been struggling with acne and have been struggling even harder using acne products. I have been on my retinol journey for quite some time and it has been so destructive to my face. I have tried to use retinol in combination with every moisturize around but yet my skin still became red, irritated, skin barrier a mess, and honestly just painful. Once I read that this product had wonderful actives like B-L3, peptides, and glycerin, I was ready to give this a chance. Within the first week of use I saw my skin go from dry and dehydrated to plump and moisturized. I couldn’t believe this cream was able to soothe my skin and give it a healthy glow. My skin tends to be on the oily side so I only use it at night since it’s pretty thick and dewy. Before bed I apply my retinol and then apply a heavy layer of this cream. I truly look like a glazed donut going to bed but I couldn’t be happier.   The application of the product is so easy with its pump having the option to click for a full pump or half pump. It also easily unscrews so you can get out every last drop when you’re at the end of the jar. I love that they have product refills so I can feel good about saving some plastic. Makes me happy I can contribute to less waste and less carbon emissions.    Overall I think this a wonderful product. I would recommend it to anyone who has dull or dry skin. I also would highly recommend this to anyone that is suffering with skin barrier issues like I was.   **This review was collected as part of a promotion."

This cream is a thick viscous cream that usually causes me to get milia around my forehead or nose area, however, this cream thus far hasn't caused any nor did it cause my sensitive skin any irritation. This cream came at a perfect time for me because here in Ohio the weather is changing and my skin gets drier than usual in the fall and winter months. Even though this cream is on the thicker side It sank into my skin and didn't leave me with greasy or oily skin.   Skinfix barrier+ Tripple Lipid-Peptide Cream is supposed to help replenish lipids + clinically proven to increase softness + radiance for healthy, nourished skin. This lovely cream is powered by a patented barrier lipid complex (B-L3) which helps refill and restore depleted lipids for smoother, more radiant, and supple skin. Nutripeptides support skin barrier health. Seaweed sodium hyaluronate deeply hydrates, and lily root extract blend helps lock hydration into the skin. Appropriate for use with retinol, AHA/BHAs, vitamin C, and more actives.   When I use Skinfix barrier+ Tripple Lipid-Peptide Cream I used at night with my retinol serum which I felt made the retinal not irritate my skin like it normally would and I'd wake up with soft, glowing skin. On nights I didn't use retinol I would use it with my glycolic acid or alone after cleansing my face. I have tried it in the AM but I prefer a light-weight cream or just an SPF, so I'm not sure how it would wear under makeup. I did feel for this cream and my SPF was too much. I love that this cream has no added fragrance, essential oils, parabens, formaldehyde, petroleum, phthalate, silicones, lanolin, propylène glycol, or pegs ni gluten. It’s vegan and cruelty-free and the component is refillable. I love the pump which dispenses the right amount and it’s more sanitary and keeps the product inside more stable."

It’s heavier than what I normally prefer, but my skin needed it to repair. I started using this moisturizer immediately when my skin started to look more red and irritated from over exfoliation, and I believe the rich nourishing formula is the only reason why my skin didn’t start flaking off. I didn’t experience any new breakout either, given the heavier texture. My skin is still on the mend, but this formula saved it from being a far worse experience.

I’ve been using the skin fix triple lupid barrier cream for about a week and I’m so thrilled with it!  I was using a serum, moisturizer and another barrier cream to get the same level of moisture I’m getting from this product alone.  It’s not at all greasy, so I can wear it under makeup without an issue.  My new routine is the barrier cream, a primer and a tinted moisturizer, and it looks flawless.  I also love this at night combined with my vitamin c serum.  I’ve noticed my skin looks not only more hydrated but also plumper, which is amazing.  I highly recommend this product, you don’t need a lot just a pea size and for the price it’s a great deal."

This moisturizer is the only one in my arsenal where you truly feel that the moisture stays on your skin all night while making it feel very soft.  No wonder it works so well, as it repairs my barrier with lipids, vitamins, and peptides. I love how creamy and thick it is, it applies with ease, yet it absorbs into the skin immediately and with no fragrance.  A nice feature is that the 1.7 oz. size is refillable, and the refill will cost about $8 less than the original component.  In addition, the push mechanism of the jar makes it more hygienic, so you’re not digging your fingers and nails into an entire jar to get the product out.  Just one or two pumps is all that is needed to apply to your entire face.  Highly recommend this gentle moisturizer for either barrier compromised skin or dry skin!"

The effects lasted throughout the day and it sat well under makeup without taking long to absorb. My skin was much better protected from getting clogged with dirt and oils from the environment/cosmetics that I used. My pores did not clog nearly as much and my skin was noticeably smoother and more even in tone/texture. It also added a bit of shine to my skin, but not so much that it appeared greasy. A light shimmer to keep me glowing. I highly recommend as a lightweight hydrating cream as it provides multiple benefits for your skin's health. The only issue was pumping it out of the container was a little difficult as the squeeze wasn't very responsive often times. Received free in exchange for review. All opinions my own."

It's free from fragrances, essential oils, formaldehyde, petroleum, phthalates, silicones, lanolin, propylene glycol, PEGs, and gluten.

My skin can be quite dry, especially during the cooler months, but this cream definitely keeps it nourished and moisturized without clogging pores or making my skin greasy. It has a rich texture but somehow seems to absorb quickly into the skin, making it soft and smooth with just a hint of glow.  What I like most is that it feels deeply hydrating but is lightweight enough to use day and night. My skin does feel much firmer and more elastic, and some patches of dryness that used to bother me have completely disappeared. It works really great under makeup-no pilling or greasiness. I've also been layering it with some stronger actives like retinol and vitamin C, and so far, no irritation or breakouts.  The fact that it is noncomedogenic and dermatologists recommend it gives me peace of mind since I have skin sensitive to breakouts.

On paper it sounds absolutely perfect for me and my skin type. I have combination skin and I'm a GenX'er so hydration and the minimization of fine line and wrinkles are an essential part of my skincare routine. It also works well for those who have sensitive and eczema-prone skin. I live in New England so as winter approaches I need to ramp up my moisturizer prep even more. Skinfix is a clean brand that relies on recycles packaging which is important to me. This product also offers refill packaging. I appreciate moisturizers with single-use dispensing so dirt and bacteria are not introduced into the product.  I used the cream as part of my regular skincare routine after cleanser, retinol cream, and Vitamin C serum. It was the only new product I introduced. The cream is unscented but I was not a fan of the scent. I'm always able to forgive a product for that if it works, however. The cream was also much heavier than I expected. I could feel it sitting on my face after application for much longer than I prefer. After two days of use the texture of my skin began to change, and not for the better. My skin is normally clear and 'stable' and I began to see raised bumps. By day three, I had three deep cyst-like pimples develop and it's rare for me to get even 1-2 of those per year. After day four I decided to discontinue use because a fourth deep cyst-pimple was beginning to develop and my skin did not appear to be happy with me at all. It was becoming difficult to apply makeup smoothly.  For those unsure of how their skin will react, I would definitely go slow and start off with a test patch. I still love the brand but this particular product is not for me."

This cream made my skin barrier very happy, helping soothe  the skin and add moisture. I feel like it helped repair my barrier and made acne marks lighter. Also, a little goes a long way with this cream. I think it will be great for combo or dry skin types, but may be too heavy feeling for oily skin. It is better suited for PM usage, but I also don't mind using in the AM either because it sinks in well with no oily residue."

My skin tends to be extra dry during the fall and winter months and this has made my face feel and look extremely hydrated. This has a rich texture that absorbs quickly and doesn't feel greasy at all. This cream makes my face feel silky smooth, plump, and healthier overall. The combination of lipids and peptides in this are incredible because it gives an extra layer of protection and makes it feel more resilient to environmental factors. Since using this my face has looked more radiant and I have also noticed a smoother complexion. My mature skin has appreciated the deep hydration and also appears to be more firm. I look forward to continuing to use this in my skincare routine. I love the refillable container concept, it works great to get the exact amount you need.

			"review_text": "I recently tried the Skinfix Barrier+ Triple Lipid-Peptide Cream, hoping it would provide the nourishing hydration my skin needed, but unfortunately, it didn’t work out for me. Here’s my detailed experience:  Texture & Application: The cream has a thick, rich texture, which I initially thought would be perfect for deeply moisturizing my skin. However, after applying it, I noticed that it felt quite heavy and didn’t absorb well into my skin. It left a greasy residue, which made my skin feel suffocated, almost as if my pores were being clogged. This was especially uncomfortable when I wore it during the day.  Skin Reaction: Within a day or two of using the cream, I started to notice red patches appearing on my skin, particularly on my cheeks and forehead. My skin also felt itchy and irritated. I later realized I was having an allergic reaction to one or more ingredients in the formula. This was surprising, especially since the product is dermatologist-recommended, but it goes to show that skincare is very individual.  Scent: The smell was another downside for me. It had a strange scent that I found unpleasant. While it wasn’t overpowering, it lingered on my skin for a while, which was bothersome.  Positives: Despite the negative experience, there were a few things I did like. The packaging is excellent – it comes in a sturdy, sleek jar with a pump that dispenses the right amount of product, keeping it hygienic and easy to use. I can see how this product might work well for those with very dry skin who need a heavy-duty moisturizer, but unfortunately, it was too much for my combination-sensitive skin."

It takes the guess work out of using this. Overall, so love the packaging. I really like how my face feels after I apply this cream. I apply it after a vitamin c serum in the mornings and I feel like they work together nicely to nourish and moisturize my face. It is a pretty thick cream. I like that, for the most part. I usually use something a little lighter in the mornings but I like the protection and moisture this gives me so I use it. It rubs in really nicely and absorbs well. My face doesn’t feel or look greasy afterwards. It also provides a nice base for makeup. My only downfall of this cream is the smell. It smells of glue, in my opinion. It’s pretty strong, too. It’s slightly off putting to be applying something that doesn’t smell nice - I would even prefer something completely unscented over this. But I do enjoy the benefits of the cream so it’s not a total deterrent. Overall, I would recommend this cream and I’ll keep it in my skincare routine."

It IS rich, so if you're on the oily side it might not be more emollient than you're used to. As a bonus, I’ve been able to use my Tretinoin again with no drying thanks to this cream :) Great product that has worked well for my sensitive skin.
