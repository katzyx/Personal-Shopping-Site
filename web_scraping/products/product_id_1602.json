I have very acne prone and oily skin, but I swim, so I never used a moisturizer for fear that I would break out like crazy with the hydration plus my oily skin. This cream not only smoothed out my skin and made it SO soft, but it didn't add ANY oil and has such a lightweight feel. It doesn't add any sort of finish to my skin, like shiny, matte, etc, which I am grateful for because other moisturizers I have used in the past make my skin very oily. Long story short, best moisturizer I've ever tried."

Definitely recommend for my other oily gals, but I don't think it'll provide nearly enough hydration for normal / dry skin types."

I have issues with even oil free moisturizers clogging my ports so when I first applied this I did a double take when it absorbed almost instantly with no residue on my especially oily areas or irritation under my eyes.

The difference in my pore size was substantial so I ordered another bottle. It doesn't clog my pores and leave me with huge oil filled pores like some creams. An amazing light weight moisturizer for summer. If you are looking for an ultra hydrating thick cream for dry flaky skin for winter months I would not suggest this cream. If you have oily/ blemished skin and pores that clog easily or need something light and refreshing for summer months, this is the face cream for you."

This cream feels like a cold glass of water for the skin as others have said in their reviews! Its so light and soft and the smell is very mild and calming. It goes on the skin so gently and doesn't leave my face sticky or cause burning or redness. The cream dissolves into my skin instantly and feels light and invisible throughout the day. It goes well under makeup as it's not thick and does not make my face sticky or oily. I have hugeeee pores and this cream seriously shrunk them somehow after the first bottle I went through. The difference in my pore size was substantial so I ordered another bottle. It doesn't clog my pores and leave me with huge oil filled pores like some creams. An amazing light weight moisturizer for summer. If you are looking for an ultra hydrating thick cream for dry flaky skin for winter months I would not suggest this cream. If you have oily/ blemished skin and pores that clog easily or need something light and refreshing for summer months, this is the face cream for you."
