			"review_text": "It opens with a fresh burst of juicy pear and ambrette, creating a vibrant and uplifting first impression. The heart features delicate rose, which adds a soft, feminine touch, while the base of musk and woody notes grounds the scent, making it warm and inviting. Lasting around 5‚Äì6 hours on my skin, and the sillage is subtle yet noticeable, perfect for everyday wear or special occasions. Overall, I like this perfume but I think is going to be more suitable for older women."

It lasts a long time, although it doesn't project too much because it's a very soft scent, which is not a negative thing. Overall, it's a very nice perfume."

I was immediately impressed by the full-sized bottle which was such a wonderful surprise! The packaging is simple yet elegant, and the bottle itself is classic and easy to handle. The back features a beautiful geometric design, adding a touch of sophistication. The lid effortlessly pulls off to reveal the spray nozzle, making application a breeze.  The scent is a lovely blend of rose and blond wood, creating a light, powdery, floral fragrance that's both pleasant and easy to wear. The fragrance embodies themes of freedom, confidence, and positive energy, which is exactly what I need at this stage of my life. I truly enjoy this fragrance and highly recommend it."
