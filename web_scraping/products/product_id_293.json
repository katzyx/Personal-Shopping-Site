I have fine 2a hair that is half wavy half straight, prone to lots of frizz and fly aways. I put this in and blow dry after every wash and it gives me days and days of smooth soft hair! It doesn't add much volume, but the softness, shine, and frizz control has made it a new staple in my routine! Does not weigh down my thin hair or make it crunchy or dry at all! you seriously wouldn't even know I had product in with this! They should honestly advertise it as a frizz control/smooth/shine mousse instead of volumizing"

Blow dried with a round brush until mostly dry and then let it fishing drying in curlers. I'm so impressed with this!"

I rough blow dried my curly, thin hair until it was mostly dry but not too dry so I could manipulate the curls. I blow dried my hair in sections, starting with the bottom third of my hair. I used half a pump on each side of each third. I like how this leaves my hair feeling. It gives it texture without being crispy. I also noticed that because of the little extra texture I get at the roots, my hair lasts a bit longer between washes. Or at least it looks fresher than it normally does. My scalp gets oily, normally, and my hair typically falls flat quickly, so the product really makes a difference.  So far, this is my favorite volumizing mousse I have tried."

As the instructions and other reviewers note, it does perform better when applied in sections. I appreciate that it doesn’t cause any greasiness or filminess, and I do not detect much of a scent. The texture is kind of a watery foam, and it’s easy to apply evenly. After styling my hair, I notice that it seems fuller and more voluminous as well as less frizzy. Although my hair seems slightly more difficult to brush out after using it and a tad drier, that’s the case with all volumizing products for me because my hair is fine and somewhat damaged. Overall, it’s an effective product for increasing volume, and I also appreciate the added benefit of heat protection. I received this product as a free sample to review."

Definitely not worth walking around smelling like I got shoved face first into a portapotty."

My hair looks full and smooth, but not dull, crunchy, or coated feeling like it is with some foam volumizers.  It really works well.  For even more volume, I use ColorWow Raise the Root on my roots.  I hope they never stop making this because it’s awesome!"

There is absolutely no volume; but worse still it doesn’t accomplish anything else either–no control, no protection, no texture, not a thing. I might as well blow dry product free!

If you apply it to your roots and use heat, you'll get lift and if you apply it throughout your hair, you'll get volume and control.  The downside is that if you apply marginally too much, your hair will looik dull and feel coated. I assume influencers get a good reward for boosting this brand.  I didn't think it performed any better than drug-store mousse.  I gave it three stars because it wasn't terrible on my fine hair and it wasn't too scented--sort of slightly coconut."

My hair came out voluminious and fresh, no dry shampoo required (and upon waking up, it still looks clean, as opposed to dry shampoo on greasy hair!)! I notice that there are a lot of negative reviews on this product. It could be that it adds a lot of protein to your hair. I have fine, silky hair and do notice that my regular mousse adds more moisture, so I'm not sure if I am going to use this as my day to day mousse as it's less hydrating than the one I use, but it definitely is a good product to add in your arsenal.

Also, when I use it a lot, it makes my scalp break out with pimples. Recently used with the Style on Steroids Texture + Finishing Spray which helped with the body when I bent over and sprayed it on my hair layers from underneath. Did it last? Not all night like it should have. I finished with my hair at 1:30p.m. and by 7:30p.m. it fell flatter, still had a little body, but not much more than when I round brush it...not bad though."

So for me it you have wavy or curly hair and want that volume, then this product is for you.  I mainly flat iron my hair and wanted more volume at the roots.  I get very little volume at the roots, I was expecting VOLUME!  It's not giving me any wow factor, at least not when I flat iron my hair.  It does make my hair look healthy.  For curls and wavy hair yup your going to get that VOLUME!  This is a foam product and it doesn't weigh my hair down.   Also there's no overpowering scent to it either."

I have been applying it to my hair when it's still slightly damp before styling and work the product from the roots through the ends. It feels pretty weightless on the hair and has a light scent. Once styled, this volumizer gives my hair a lot of extra oomph! It helps lift at the roots and gives a fuller appearance all over.

			"review_text": "Color Wow bombshell volumizer mousse is a game changer for me when it comes to adding volume and texture to my hair. This product is easy to apply and instantly transforms my hair from flat to voluminous without weighing it down or feeling heavy or sticky. It gives my hair a full-bodied look as if I have a lot more hair than I actually do.   One of the best things about this hair mousse is that it doesn't leave any residue or make my hair feel like it has product in it. It's so lightweight that I can barely even tell that I'm wearing it. Another great feature of this product is that it works well without the need for heat styling. Even when I let my hair air dry, it still adds the perfect amount of volume and texture.  Overall, I am impressed with Color Wow hair mousse and will definitely be repurchasing it in the future. It's a must-have for anyone looking to add volume and texture to their hair without any heavy or sticky feeling. I highly recommend this product to anyone who wants to achieve a full-bodied, voluminous look in seconds. @fabbeautyboss"

I have dense, short hair (think pixie cut or shorter), that can build volume but is heavy and prefers to lay together. I was hoping this would help add some fluff to my hair, lift or hold to my roots at least and it didn't do too much so far. The foam goes on really nicely, it feels very slick and has a very light smell that dissipates quickly and I haven't found irritating. Both air drying and using a hair dryer (my normal styling) I haven't noticed a volume difference at all. Again, I think this is because of my hair type. Perhaps with longer or less heavy/dense hair the results may be more obvious.  It does have a few less fly-aways   Gifted by Color Wow for review"

I think those of us with naturally curly hair all want volume at the roots with as little effort as possible but this just didn’t do that for me. It was kind of the opposite   It weighed my hair down and made it stringy. It does an OK job when I wear my hair straight, but that’s not really what I wanted it for. I do love the packaging though, the mousse pump top container is handy and the bottle is huge so it’s going to last forever if it works for your hair type. Mine is just thin and easily weighed down sadly. Gifted from color wow for review."

			"review_text": "I have to start out by saying I have VERY FINE HAIR and a lot of it. I wasn’t sure if this product would work bc of that and I was THRILLED it did! It didn’t make it like I just had a round brush blow out but it did add body and it made my hair SO smooth without weighing it down!   Pros: Easy to use Added body and volume to my fine hair Smoothing and Shining effect that lasted days   Cons: Honestly none- except it wasn’t WOW va va voom volume but that’s only because of my hair type (fine, thin, and a lot of it)   Also: The product is light weight and not over foamy and sticky as well which I liked as well!  FYI I let it air dry (which I usually do) so perhaps blow drying would have added even extra.    I received this product complimentary from Color Wow for my honest review but trust me I will definitely be buying!"

It breaks down into a watery texture as you finger comb it into your roots. I let my hair air dry and wow wow wow, volume galore! About my hair, it's on the thinner side and goes flat immediately so this was a great product to really test out and volume wise, I love it! I can scrunch it into my hair as well while it dries and it holds my natural wavy pattern and defines it more. My only con: it leaves this nasty film in my hair and you can feel it if you touch your hair throughout the day. If it didn't leave this weird film, it would definitely be 5 out of 5 stars! *complimentary from colorwow*"
