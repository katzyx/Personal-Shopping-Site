This lip/cheek stain made my lips feel moisturized and did not seem to dry my lips out after it wore off. I don't consider it to be a true lip stain. It lasted 2+ hours without eating, drinking, or talking. About 3.5 hours after applying the lip stain and after eating and drinking, my lips were very subtly tinted (mostly along the perimeter). Not terrible. However, $25 for a 0.17 oz bottle is not budget-friendly for everyday use."

			"review_text": "I just want to preface this review by saying the product is cute and there are no horrible defects or problems with it.   I ordered the Peach color of this product and while it was smaller than anticipated, it was still cute, I liked the packaging. That being said based on my experience and some of the other reviews the color you buy means nothing because after the product sits on your lips for a little while they all turn about the same shade. When I applied this product it started out as the lovely peach shade that I was aiming for but within one or two minutes it became a sort of generic deep pink/ berry color; still very pretty, but not what I really wanted.   Wiping the product off to see the stain, I was also disappointed. My lips looked pretty much the same as whenever I wipe other lip products off my lips-- so the stain was minimal at best.  Using the product as a blush was a bit tricky as well. The formula is very watery and sheer so I had to really work at applying a few layers to achieve a non-patchy and visible blush. It's pretty once you get there but I was hoping for a more seamless application and payoff.  Lastly, the packaging, as I mentioned before very cute. The actual tube of the product is set in a silicone base giving it a bit of charm and protection. Receiving the product brand new-- the silicone has a nice slightly glassy finish. The bottle fell on my floor and instinctively washed the container and unfortunately the silicone does not hold up well to regular soap and water. The gloss is gone, the silicone looks perpetually scuffed even though it isn't, making the product look months older than it really is.   All of these small things combined, I would not purchase any of the other colors, but I will finish this one off because it's still a fine lip product formulation, it was just disappointing on a few of its selling points."

			"review_text": "As I've aged, the color on my lips have just turned light and I don't look as alive, therefore I only really use lip stains bc everything wears off my lips too fast since I talk and snack a lot. Unfortunately most lip stains dry out my lips/stain weird. I have super dry lips so I know what is going turn my mouth into a raisin right when I put it on. Finally tried these and they r amazing! These r the most comfortable stains ever! and stains my lips well/last long. At first I was turned off by the package, but now I love how compact and cute it is! Easy to travel and have multiple. If I want a deeper stain I apply twice while drying in between. If I want to be natural just one layer. I usually get them from kaja, but glad that Sephora carries them. I'll be buying these forever bc it's the the best stain product I've found so far. Highly recommend!!!"

It's also super easy to apply, and I love that it comes with a built-in keychain so I can always keep it with me."

The lip shade, squeeze guava, is a very pretty shade. It makes my lips look glossy and pop with color. It works well on my lips but I am not a fan of using this as a blush because of the stickiness. The trinket looks very girly and would be a great stocking stuffer for a young girl or even a young teen."

I like the fact that it can be a keychain so it’s more convenient. Plus, there’s a fun glittery heart attached to it which I like messing with. It has a nice, sweet smell to it but isn’t overly strong so it’s not overwhelming. I’d say it smells less like candy sweet and more like perfume? I was a little worried because I like more subtle colors, but this one is perfect. Just looking at the color doesn’t really do it justice. It’s a very light color that gives your lips a pinkish coloring with a nice glossy shine. It doesn’t feel heavy or sticky at all. I would definitely recommend this color specifically if you are looking for a subtle look. The only thing is that i’m not a huge fan of the material used for the bottom part of the bottle. That is just personal preference though and really doesn’t affect the product at all."

The shade looked little lighter on lips as compared to when applied to skin. When applied to cheeks it gives a natural look that I really like. But it's a little sticky for cheeks.

It's a versatile, moisturizing, and beautiful way to add a pop of color to my lips and cheeks. I'm absolutely in love with the results, and it's a must-have in my makeup bag."

I also have it in squeeze guava. I take it with me whenever I leave the house because it’s the perfect product for touch ups on the go, and you’ll still look gorgeous. I will say don’t count on it to stain your lips. I think of it more as a cross between a tinted balm and tinted gloss. It does stain your cheeks a bit more, but I really just use it on my lips because it’s just so good for that. I have the two warmest shades because I think that’s what best compliments my skin tone. But I eventually want to get them all. This product was gifted to me by Kaja in exchange for my honest review."

			"review_text": "I was gifted by kajabeauty the Kaja Jelly Charm Lip & Blush Glazed Keychain Stain in the color Mocha Glazed. This color is like a very light brown and can be built up to get a darker stain. It applies so smooth and doesn't leave any sticky feeling. It has a semi shine, but once completely dry, it has that perfect amount of glow finish to give a hydrated look to the lips and cheeks. I do not wipe it off after applying it, instead I just let it wear off by itself and it's perfect. I thought the brown color would not look good on cheeks but I was wrong! It gives it enough color to look natural and give a bit of a flush look. After it's worn off, it leaves your lips feeling so smooth and soft, it's almost as if I had applied lip balm plus leaves that bit of stain giving the lips a natural flush of color. It has all natural ingredients and I'm thinking the squalene is what gives us that hydration. I love the keychain it comes with because it gives it a pop of color and you can easily attach this to your purse, bookbag, or carry it with your keys. My Personal favorite is having it on the strap of my bag. It's the perfect size to carry with you. I will say it comes at a hefty price point for the amount of product you get but since it's vegan and has so many natural ingredients, I think it's worth it."

This is meant to be worn on your lips and cheeks.  The ending stain was a nice deep mocha brown. I like that it’s vegan and cruelty-free.

The color was a bit more red upon dry down than I would have liked however it is still a pretty shade, I would just have preferred the shade stay more of the initial brown tone it has when it is glossy.   Upon application the product has a nice serum feel almost, not too oily and not sticky at all. It does dry down but does not give a tight dry feeling like some stains can.  The scent is very light and fruity. Inoffensive to most I’m sure.  Personally I think the keychain cheapens the look of the product and is completely unnecessary."

I didn’t really like the texture of the product on my check. Overall I would recommend this product as a lip glaze, it applies great on the lips and looks beautiful.

The formula glides on smoothly and leaves a natural, radiant finish on both lips and cheeks. The pigment is rich, yet buildable, ensuring you can control the intensity of your look from subtly sun-kissed to vibrant and bold. Despite its long-lasting formula, it feels incredibly light, almost like wearing nothing. Its cute packaging is a bonus, making it not just a beauty product, but a stylish accessory.

To be honest, the packaging was the reason I requested to test this product. The little keychain is absolutely adorable. I've been a fan of K-beauty jelly lip stains for ages so I was trusting Kaja to do a good job because Kaja was created in collaboration with one of my favorite K-Beauty brands. These do the job of a jelly stain as expected, though I will say that they are more of a gloss in the way that I use mine as the stain is not super long lasting. I have better luck with wear time on my cheeks where this product makes such a pretty luminous blush when tapped on with fingers!   I really enjoy this product and will keep using it, another win for Kaja in my book!"

Not as perfect as a cheek product for me tho. I can make it work with a damp sponge, but don’t rely on your fingers because it will not blend well.

I tested the jelly charm lip and blush glazed keychain stain in the color peach fizz. This is a beautiful color and I love that it is lightweight and sheer . You can apply more than one layer to get a full Glam look or a monochromatic look. I applied this blusher directly on my cheekbones and applied using my fingers. It is a Rose color on my olive neutral skin! I also applied a small amount on my lips after exfoliating with my lip scrub. I am in love with the color and the texture. The texture is very silky and soft. The ingredients are skin loving including Triple berry complex to protect your skin. Lemon fruit extract is moisturizing and helps to brighten skin.  Olive squalene is one of my favorite ingredients for more moisture and provides antioxidants. The packaging for this cheek and lip stain is so adorable! I love the keychain that comes with this product. It is very glamorous and something that I would have loved when I was younger too! The amount is a bit smaller than what I thought it was going to be but this product will still last me months or more. I think for the overall quality that the price is affordable.  This versatile product comes in 6 different shades! I think I'm going to try the Cherry next or the guava. This product is available to purchase at Sephora and at kajabeauty.com. you can attach the keychain to your purse, book bag or in your pocket wherever your preference is. I highly recommend this product to anyone looking for a buildable stain and the packaging alone is so pretty that I would order it just for that again!"

It goes away quickly, but I'd rather it didn't have taste at all. I didn't end up using it as a blush much since it looks kind of patchy on my cheeks, but as a lip product I think it's ok. The key chain is a cute touch too, it's unfortunate that it has this weird bitter taste, otherwise I'd use this product more often. Gifted by kajabeauty in exchange for an honest review."

On my lips it stays comfortable even after drying or wearing off and the wear itself is even. No patches or spots peeling off like some stains. And its SO easy to get a soft focus look too.

It's very comfortable to wear and didn't feel sticky. It did stay put after I drank water several times and didn't stain my water bottle (I was surprised) but, besides that, it came off pretty quickly. The stain it leaves is mostly around the center of my lips and I wish it was more pigmented. I didn't really care for it as a blush because it's tacky and slippery, and moves everything underneath around. I think the price is steep for it when there are bigger sized lip oil out there that are cheaper or about the same price. This one is tiny!"

It lasts very well and does not leave the cheeks feeling sticky. As a lip stain, it fades a little quicker, but looks like a beautiful and soft tint. It is hydrating, but not sticky or greasy. If you avoid eating or talking too much for the first 30 minutes it will stain better. The keychain may seem cheesy, but it is both nostalgic and convenient. I keep it on my keys to ensure I always have something to add a flush of color on the go."

These can be worn as both cheek and lip products, but my preferred method is as a blush. As a blush, these are so easy and effortless to apply. The product feels almost silky on your skin, and you can either use a brush or your fingers to gently blend. It's hard to overdo these, and as such you may find you want to build for intense color (I used two layers in the photo, applied as blush only). Admittedly this makes it hard for me to gauge if these will show up as much on deeper skin tones, so that is something to keep in mind.  I'll likely end up purchasing more, as I love the formula and the addition of the keychain is just so cute!"

I’m very familiar with the formula as a lot of other Korean makeup brands have similar products, but I think this is a bit more unique among the Western market. This feels like a liquid version of a glowy lip balm that leaves behind a light stain when wiped away. This has a light fruity scent that disappears after a few minutes. Depending on the shade, this leaves behind a stain when wiped off (my shade left a very faint stain, but a darker color may provide different results). The packaging is A+ and is super cute, especially with the key chain. I love that it’s portable and small enough to carry around easily. Overall, I think this is perfect for those who don’t like to fuss around too much with their lip makeup, but would still like something that looks like one put in some effort to look good."

And the applicator is one of those sponge-y lip applicators, which works much better than the brush, even for cheeks (which is all I use it for). It’s also more concentrated so you only need to apply half as much. I’m a convert. There’s def a learning curve for applying, but if you’ve already been using cheek stain you’ll love this."

They are also super tiny with impractical/wasteful packaging - say if you finished one, you would have to buy another one with all the plastic (keychain tassel, silicon holder) instead of getting a refill.

The color is so flattering, I feel like it’s my perfect shade. The actual packaging is beyond cute and the keychain was a cute touch. Love how the bottle is covered in silicone, it protects it so they bottle doesn’t break. The keychain looks super cute on my purses and backpacks. Keychain also makes it super easy to access, instead of having to dig through your bag it’s on the keychain making reapplication quick! The only recommendation I have is that the actual keychain could be better quality, mine has fallen off my bag quite a few times but luckily each time I’ve heard it drop and found it. Super cute and quality product. Love that you can also use as a cheek tint!"

			"review_text": "#complimentary from Kaja JELLY CHARM Lip & Blush Glazed Keychain Stain   I can’t get over the cuteness of this Kaja Jelly Charm Lip & Blush Glazed Keychain Stain! It’s one of the cutest and most versatile products that I don’t mind carrying and using every day thanks to the lovely looking keychain that comes with it for your convenience.   I received the 05 Peach Fizz. It’s a pretty beautiful shade, and the doe foot applicator makes it so easy for me to apply the creamy formula precisely on my lips with less mess and product waste. I can also lightly dot a few drops of the glaze on my cheeks and blend it in with the tip of my finger to add more liveliness to my cheeks’ contour. The formula is very lightweight and feels incredibly smooth as it glides beautifully and cleanly on my lips. It’s buildable and will leave you with a pretty juicy, jelly like glaze on the lips that is well moisturized, protects and keeps your lips healthy"

Upon receiving it, I didn’t feel anything in particular. Maybe I felt a little excitement because I did want the lip stain so bad. I have a light/medium skin tone and I chose peach fizz and I think it’s super flattering on my skin tone. It’s a beautiful glossy, semi-thick formula. It goes on well and it layers well. It’s small and can go anywhere you go as long as you take your keys with you. You can hook it up to your lanyard, keys, backpack, etc. I genuinely enjoy the formula and it does bring color to my cheeks as well. It’s a nice, soft, dewy look. I knocked off a star because considering other lip stain keychains I’ve bought, it’s super tiny. However, I added a star back because that formula is gorgeous and it fades so beautifully."

Perhaps others may like it, but it was very middle school, beginners makeup. I selected this because of the ingredients and I expected more of a color payoff and a glossy feel, but it was a little sticky and although the smell is light, it wasn’t desirable. The product did wipe away easily and I get see how some people may think this is moisturizing. Worth a try though! For a keychain, it’s cute and would do in a pinch. So sorry for the poor review."

The keychain is adorable and it gives me childhood nostalgia, but it's kind of bulky for a lip gloss. I can't see me realistically keeping the keychain attached. The color wasn't quite what I thought it would be, which was disappointing, and the bottle is REALLY small. That being said, I LOVED the formula and try as I might, I couldn't find any chemical or lipstick-y smell to it. The bottle seals tightly and the doe's foot does a great job at evenly dispersing the color. I would definitely buy these if they were on sale. Gifted by Kaja."

You can connect it to your keys or purse to always have it with you on the go. The color is not as dark as it looks on the doe foot applicator. It goes on sheer and has a glow to it, but the texture feels buttery rather than slick or glossy on the lips. I think I’ll use this shade (Berry Colada) more as a blush than a lip gloss, but it works nicely for both purposes. It does contain added fragrance and has a kind of peachy champagne scent. The price seems a bit high for the size of the product, so you may be best served by waiting for it to go on sale."

It comes with a keychain attachment and some charms and has a lip gloss style applicator when you unscrew the top. this blush has a lightweight formula that leaves my face with a soft glow and it’s very lightly tinted so I’ve enjoyed using it on the days where I’m not wearing any make up at all. I also applied it on my lips and lightly gave them a rosy appearance. I love how cute the charms are and I know I’m gonna have a hard time with my daughter since she’s gonna want to take this from me."

The product itself glides on with the doe foot applicator.  It feels nice on my lips and is not sticky.  It gives just a little bit of tint and is pretty neutral.  It makes a nice light blush on my cheeks as well. The color is somewhat buildable but stays pretty sheer overall.  I wish the color lasted a little longer on my lips.  I feel like it wears off pretty quickly.  And, I wish it would dry faster on my cheeks.  It transfers easily because it takes so long to dry.  It stained my cheeks and was hard to completely remove with cleanser. I just prefer to use it on my lips.  It contains olive squalane to help with moisture.  It is vegan, cruelty free and made with clean ingredients.  I received this complimentary from Kaja in exchange for my honest review."

I love the glitter heart charm; it's squishy and reminds me of the charms I used to have as a kid. The lip stain itself is fairly mild and easy to apply. It has a creamy and jelly like texture that's refreshing. The color comes off somewhat easily for lip stain but leaves a soft hue behind. As a cheek stain it is also mildly pigmented and more product can be layered for a stronger tinted effect. It has a slight fruity flavor"

He has many features, besides a lippie/blush on a keychain. This duo jelly charm is very adorable. It features a chain in which you can add to your keychains or a bag, a cute heart globe with glitter and the logo. It has an external container so you can refill it making it sustainable. Peachy fizz is a very natural color with peachy mauve natural glaze to it. The product was not sticky, clumpy or heavy and scent. I love this adorable, jelly, charm lip, and blush glaze keychain stain, and recommended to anyone who is looking for a little bit of color on the go."

The sparkly heart is squishy and I like to fiddle with it if I'm nervous or need to get my mind off of something. The color Peach Fizz is a nice everyday pinky-peach that looks like your lips but better, and it leaves behind a very subtle stain so there's still some color left even if the glossy part rubs off. The formula is runny and doesn't last long on the lips, maybe one-two hours tops. I also tried using it on the cheeks as a blush and it works fine with minimal makeup looks. I don't think it will work over thick foundation because the formula needs to adhere to your actual skin (the tint, too) but if you normally do tinted moisturizer or no foundation at all, this can work just fine as a blush. // gifted by Kaja"

I prefer the actual product on my lips rather than on my cheeks because the formula feels more like a non-sticky lip gloss than a cream cheek product. I have the color Fig Soda, and it’s a perfect rosy neutral tone. I think I’ll like this a lot more in Spring and Summer when my lips aren’t so dry, because while this formula isn’t super drying, it’s also not hydrating."

However, the pigment is better when using it as a lip stain, as it emphasizes your natural lip color. Unfortunately, the tint does not last very long, and I found myself reapplying constantly. It doesn’t pill or clump, which I appreciate, but I do believe there are better options for a quality lip/cheek stain available."

They are not at all dry and patchy like most stains.  no it doesn't stay on for a super long time, but id rather reapply this than use some crusty stain that clings to every dry patch on my lips.  they did such a good job with the shades, literally like you rubbed a Popsicle on your lips.  Cherry spritz, available at Kaja only, go get it."

I ended up buying another one (Squeeze Guava) and again, I love the way it looks and feels on the lips but there are a few things to know! It has an unpleasant taste and textured skin beware! Since it’s a stain, I’m pretty sure it stains the cheeks as well. I have enlarged pores and the stain made it look like I had rosacea. It also feels sticky on the cheeks. I think the peach fizz color was okay on the cheeks but I’ll be using these mainly for my lips now."

After wiping off the gloss, I didn't notice any transferring. When I tried it as a blush, it felt a little sticky at first and the color wasn't really apparent until I layered it again.
