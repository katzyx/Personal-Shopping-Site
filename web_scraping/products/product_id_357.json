However it barely took off any of my Urban decay waterproof perversion mascara. I'm extremely disappointed. The product also made my eyes sting, possibly from the strong fragrance."

It doesn't feel like a regular oil either, you have to use a lot to feel something. And the bottle is SO SO small (which is another issue on how much you use, you'll use it all by the end of the week), it's ridiculous. $17 for a 1oz that's the size of my pinkie?! No thank you. Don't waste your money please, get another oil cleanser and don't waste your time or money on this"

I used it every evening for a few weeks as the first step of my routine. I applied a few drops to dry skin and massaged it in. Then I added water and continued massaging, finally rinsing it off and following with a gel cleanser. I bought the mini which is a nice tester size, I got a few weeks out of half the bottle before I stopped using it.   I thought it was okay. It cleanses well without drying, but I find my gel cleanser works perfectly on its own and this product doesn't add anything to my cleansing step. It also has a strong citrusy-floral scent which I don't like. If you're avoiding strong fragrances, avoid this item. I think we should leave the fragrance to incense, perfume, etc. I won't be repurchasing."

I do like the smell of it, and it feels good on my face, however it does not remove mascara, which is annoying. Also, my acne seems to have gotten worse since starting to use this over a month ago.

I have issues with sebaceous filaments on my nose and my chin, particularly right under my lower lip. The photos that I share here are after one use, and now I'm hooked on double cleansing! Not only is there a huge difference in the way that my skin looks, but it also feels more smooth and clean. This oil is nice and light, smells wonderful, and left my skin feeling way more soft and hydrated then it typically feels after I use my everyday water cleanser (which is still great!) The pump works great and the bottle is a nice size. I'm not a giant fan of the price, but I can't complain too much based on the results. I'm so glad to have found this and I wish I would have started sooner.  (Also just adding this disclaimer that my review is NOT incentivized, I left a review on another product that I purchased and it was marked as incentivized even though I didn't click the box. I'm always searching for non-incentivized AND verified purchases, so just wanted to share that.)"
