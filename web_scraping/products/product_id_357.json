It doesn't feel like a regular oil either, you have to use a lot to feel something. And the bottle is SO SO small (which is another issue on how much you use, you'll use it all by the end of the week), it's ridiculous. $17 for a 1oz that's the size of my pinkie?! No thank you. Don't waste your money please, get another oil cleanser and don't waste your time or money on this"

I used it every evening for a few weeks as the first step of my routine. I applied a few drops to dry skin and massaged it in. Then I added water and continued massaging, finally rinsing it off and following with a gel cleanser. I bought the mini which is a nice tester size, I got a few weeks out of half the bottle before I stopped using it.   I thought it was okay. It cleanses well without drying, but I find my gel cleanser works perfectly on its own and this product doesn't add anything to my cleansing step. It also has a strong citrusy-floral scent which I don't like. If you're avoiding strong fragrances, avoid this item. I think we should leave the fragrance to incense, perfume, etc. I won't be repurchasing."

This oil is nice and light, smells wonderful, and left my skin feeling way more soft and hydrated then it typically feels after I use my everyday water cleanser (which is still great!) The pump works great and the bottle is a nice size. I'm not a giant fan of the price, but I can't complain too much based on the results. I'm so glad to have found this and I wish I would have started sooner.  (Also just adding this disclaimer that my review is NOT incentivized, I left a review on another product that I purchased and it was marked as incentivized even though I didn't click the box.

I made sure to follow this up with a regular, water based cleanser that I’ve been using successfully for years. While it did an amazing job with cleaning out sebaceous filaments on my nose (it was a noticeable improvement even after 1 use), this pre-cleanse made me break out terribly all over the rest of my face! I haven’t had forehead acne in 10 years, but now I’m dealing with a breakout that makes me look and feel like a teenager again. It is slow to heal, too- I’m really hoping this hasn’t completely messed my skin up for long."
