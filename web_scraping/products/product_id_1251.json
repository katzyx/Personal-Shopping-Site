I didn't how thick it would be and it just feels like a really nice and silky moisturizer. I don't typically like skincare that has strong scents but this smells amazing. Even though it is a bit expensive, I'm happy to see that some people use it nightly because it's going to be hard for me to choose my regular night moisturizer over this going forward!"
