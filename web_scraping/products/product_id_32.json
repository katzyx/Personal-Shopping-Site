It's a true clear gel not a milky colour like others and has a nice hold without being too stiff. Love that it's clean; also love the minimalist tube. The wand bristles are longer on one side, which is the side I prefer using. I wish the long bristles went the whole way around - the product disperses much more evenly without over saturating the brow hairs. This is the first Ami Colé product I've purchased. The packaging is really luxe and looks high end. Overall really pleased. Will definitely repurchase and am looking forward to trying their other products!"

I prefer color with a neutral undertone (on occasion with a cool undertone) in mid to deep shades. Eyeshadows in mid to deep blues, purples (not plum), greens, browns and greys. Lippies in brown with purple (not plum) undertone, vampy reds, muted purples and deep mauve and berries.  As much as I want to like this (I love almost all your other products), this one doesn't give me the hold I need.   I thought it might be because it's too wet or too much on the wand and wiped some off. However, my brow hairs still fall. Even after attempting to plaster them down as it dries.  If you're someone who doesn't need a lot of hold, this is for you. I need cement."

That includes trimming my brows, so this small brow gel fits in almost any pocket and helps me set my hairs in place to always look fresh whenever I’m outside.  The bristles on the brush are gentle, and the formulation to the gel is not irritating to my skin.  Making this product great for all skin types.  It’s a great gift for anyone into caring for their eyebrows since this helps maintain your brows whether you fill them in or just grooming purposes."

The formula is lightweight yet incredibly effective at taming stray hairs and keeping my brows in place all day long.  What sets this gel apart is its ultra-flex technology, which allows for effortless application and a natural, flexible hold. Unlike other gels that leave brows stiff or sticky, this one leaves them feeling soft and touchable. Plus, the clear formula means it's suitable for all brow colors and won't leave any residue behind."

I have sparse 90s Kate Moss brows and just need them to stay up, this did the trick with no weird issues or flaking. The long side of the brush is very clever and helps to really saturate your brows before putting them in their place."
