			"review_text": "I've always loved L'Occitane's Amande scent. Growing up, my mother used the body wash, lotions, and oil; I loved how the scent would trail after her, intertwining with her Chanel No. 5. I was permitted to use her L'Occitane products on special occasions, which I coveted every milisecond of. They felt so luxurious; so hydrating that my skin would gleam after application, and the scent was unbelievably enchanting, deliciously fragrant. The aroma made me feel so elegant, so put together.     I'm pleased to learn that these products are exactly the same as I remember, and now that I am an adult with the budget for it, I will be treating myself to more of these Amande products. I may not actually be elegant and luxurious, but you would certainly think so if you smelled me."

It's not that it's unpleasant, it's that it's STRONG and LINGERS. I wouldn't mind smelling like the mall for a few minutes post-shower, but it's a scent that remains for literally HOURS. If it was subtle like the shower oil, I'd give it five stars but the level of scent in this balm has me stretching to give it two."

Holy grail product! It takes me three months to go through a tin, using on my whole body about three times a week. Lovely light fragrance that doesn't compete with perfumes, sinks in immediately, not at all greasy, absolutely worth the price."

When I saw this in the almond line, I knew I had to have it. I use it after I shower and my legs are smooth for days! I take a little and warm it up in my hands before slathering it on. It smells amazing and glides on so smooth without leaving a Greasy feeling. It is on the pricey side for the amount of product you get, but I still think it is worth it."

I use it after I get out of the shower and apply it from head to toe.  It absorbs so nice into the skin and doesn't feel heavy or greasy.  It pairs great with the almond oil if you need extra hydration.  This is a great product for people who have dry skin.  I wish it came in a bigger size and even travel size."

The balm is more moisturizing and softening than the cream and the oil, in my opinion. A little goes a long way! I warm it up in my hands and massage it in. Smells like the rest of the line (which is delicious). The tin doesn't bother me, seems kind of vintage to me."

I do prefer to use this one when I get out of the shower and before I go to bed. It has the classic yummy, but not artificial almond smell, like the rest of the almond line, which I love. My only gripe is the the tin it comes in for the price is a little cheap feeling and looking. It could be much better. But, the product is the most important and it‚Äôs a great addition to their almond line."
