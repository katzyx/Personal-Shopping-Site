When I applied the leave-in conditioner, I was pleasantly surprised by its creamy, lightweight texture and unique scent, which left my hair feeling super soft and well-hydrated.   üåüAfter the first use, I noticed a significant improvement in the appearance of my split ends, and my hair felt hydrated, smoother, and easier to detangle. I also loved that it helped seal my split ends, took care of my hair, and protected it from styling and heat damage. I'm happy with how much healthier and stronger my hair looks since I started using this product. I'm totally in love with Olaplex!"

I have high porosity hair that tends to be on the drier side, with medium thickness and a few wavy curls. Finding the right products can be tricky, but Olaplex has been a game changer. This particular formula is incredibly light yet smoothing, offering a noticeable improvement without weighing my hair down. It‚Äôs a bit lighter than the No. 6, which I also adore, but still gives that soft, nourished feel I love. My hair has been noticeably shinier and more manageable since incorporating this into my routine. It doesn't feel greasy or heavy‚Äîjust smooth, hydrated, and much more defined. I‚Äôm definitely stocking up on this and will continue to make it a part of my regimen. If you have high porosity hair like mine, I highly recommend giving this one a try!"

At first, I didn't see too much of a difference until the third time I used it. It's amazing! It's the one product I know I can expect noticeable results and make my hair from mid shaft to ends look like I just got a haircut and color.  No more split ends popping out or sticking out making my hair look like a scarecrow. By the way my hair is medium thickness but has many breakage and split ends due to hair extensions and not being able to cut all the bad off unless I wanted a short short haircut which I don't. Another main thing that I love about this product is that I put it on the next day for hydration and it doesn't leave residue or make my hair look like I hadn't washed it. It just looks healthy. This project really does hydrate. I'm so glad I purchased this item and I don't really leave reviews but I knew that I wanted other women to find something that actually works without spending hundreds of dollars.  The pictures I posted are from the second day without using the product. So I applied the product the day before and this is second day. My hair is not or was not this healthy LOL and I did not use any filters"

I love that my hair feels smoother and looks nourished with this product. The only thing I don't like is that the smell is not the same as the old product or other products from this line.

I tried this product in hopes of repairing my hair and creating a sleeker, smoother appearance. The first thing I noticed about this conditioner is the texture. It's thick and viscous, but still runs. It feels rich in the hand and smells wonderful, without being overpowering more of a clean scent. The first time I used this I used 2 pumps as directed on damp clean hair. I noticed immediately my hair looked smoother and shinier within hours. However, by the end of the day and into the next day, it felt a little weighed down. I have wavy hair and it gets pretty flat and straight. If a product is even slightly heavy It's a struggle to moisturized. Ue to this the second time I used it. I only used 1 pump, and that suited my hair much better. It still felt heavier than normal a couple of days after using it. But my hair also looked smoother and way shinier. Overall, I really like this, leaving treatment and how it made my hair. Look, I wish it was a tad lighter so I could go longer between hair washes. But with the right amount, it's not a deal breaker, and I will still continue using it. I received this product as part of a promotion."

I just have coarse boring dry hair lol. I‚Äôve heard so many great things about the Olaplex brand so I really wanted to try this cream!  I‚Äôm a huge fan of leave in‚Äôs, but sometimes they just leave my hair a sticky mess. This No.5 did neither! Wow, I couldn‚Äôt believe the instant softnes, there was a shine that I‚Äôve not seen from my hair. It visibly looks healthier and has a lot more Vavoom type fullness that I never see unless I use a box full of different products. This leave in actually gives me a wash and go option that I rarely get to experience. After shampooing/conditioner I used 2 pumps while my hair was still damp. This formula distributed so evenly through my hair. The scent was also pretty incredible. Such an energetic scent, I‚Äôm a huge fan of citrus and am truly grateful that it doesn‚Äôt have a super sweet scent. This leave in has definitely stepped up my styling game and has totally changed how my hair looks. It doesn‚Äôt visibly look frizzy(or at least how it normally does) and you can clearly see in the before and after. I love this product so much! This review was collected as a part of a promotion."

I was super stoked to hear when they were releasing a new leave in conditioner, as a certified olaplex stylist myself this meant another amazing product to learn and include in the lineup of hair repair! I can tell you it did not disappoint! The No 5 leave in is a really release that I'm super excited to have in my lineup against hair damage, another great product that allows me to take risks with hair that weren't possible prior.. You get a really good amount of product in this bottle first of all and it really goes a long way, you don't need much.. I tell clients to apply a half pump at a time and you can always add more instead of wasting it.. It immediately makes the hair more manageable and reduces any tangles making it easy to comb through. It leaves the hair feeling immediately healthier, shinier and softer. And I love that it's also a heat protectant and seals down the outer cuticle leaving the Hair feeling smoother.. Another great product from Olaplex.."

I have dense and coarse hair, and was surprised at how much 1-2 pumps could do. A LITTLE GOES A LONG WAY. Too much will absolutely leave an unpleasant feeling in your hair. It has some sort of watery lotion texture and the scent is extremely odd but not disgusting. I split my hair into four sections, and then split each section two more times, then used a half pump on each split section. As I went on, I started using less and less because the residue built up on my hands (a good thing). Blow-drying my hair after was a breeze. I didn't notice any breakage on my ends or any frizz around my hairline. I think anyone can use this product but please read directions and be careful with how much you apply."

My hair actually looks lustrous!!Another benefit from this leave-in conditioner is that it provides heat protection up to 450 degrees and that for me is a game changer because of what I put my hair through every day with all of my hot tools.

I love that I didn‚Äôt need to remove any steps from my routine (I normally use conditioner and a rinse-off hair mask) to make this product work for me.

I used 3 pumps and concentrated on the ends and mid shaft splits. I have alot of hair but finer fragile strands and I felt that more than 3 pumps would have weighed my hair down. I was happy with the shine it brought to my dull strands. However, I was really impressed with the reduction of frizz and smoothing because my cuticles weren't lifted. My hair looks significantly healthier and I will definitely continue to use this for heat styling. My flat iron easily glides with this product and did not snag my strands. I'm not one for heavily fragrances products so I was happy with the light citrus scent.This product really sealed and hydrated my dry ends making my ends feel much thicker and appear fuller."

It tackles my split ends while leaving my hair smooth and hydrated.   Overall, I love how it absorbs so easily, layers well with my other styling products and it makes my hair look both healthier and shinier with each use. It's been a lifesaver for taming frizz and enhancing my curl definition. I highly recommend it for anyone with dry, or damaged hair!"

			"review_text": "I've found Olaplex No.5 Leave-In Conditioner to be a fantastic addition to my routine. This product addresses my specific hair needs by delivering deep hydration to my dry ends and helping to balance my hair's overall moisture. The formula, enriched with OLAPLEX Bond Building Technology, is particularly effective for my highlighted hair. It strengthens and repairs my hair structure, which is essential for maintaining its health and preventing damage. The leave-in conditioner smooths and detangles my waves, leaving them softer and shinier without adding weight. I appreciate that it can be applied to both damp and dry hair, and even on already styled hair the next day, without causing heaviness or buildup. The lightweight nature of this conditioner ensures that my hair stays grease-free while receiving the moisture it needs. It keeps my waves defined and healthy-looking, avoiding the common heaviness of other leave-in products. While the scent can be a bit strong initially, it fades quickly and doesn't affect the product's effectiveness. By applying it mainly to my mid-lengths and ends, I can enjoy soft, shiny hair while maintaining a balanced scalp. In conjunction with No.4 Bond Maintenance Shampoo and No.5 Bond Maintenance Conditioner, Olaplex No.5 Leave-In Conditioner has helped me achieve the healthy, manageable, and glossy hair I've been striving for."

I regret waiting to try No. 5 Leave - In conditioner, because it has now completely transformed my challenging hair. Very thick, long and color-treated, my strands tangle easily. Using this very lightly scented product makes brushing so much faster and allows for gentler strokes which helps to prevent breakage. My hair stays smooth for longer in between styling and I am able to create a look more quickly. Saving my hair and my time is well worth it!

If anyone else has this hair type, you know how hard it is to find products that work well. I typically need a good conditioner, but the ones that work well usually weigh my hair down super easily. This leave in conditioner worked really well with my hair. I didn't notice any extra weight added and it did seem to help ease tangles and make my hair less frizzy. I didn't notice my hair getting greasy earlier then normal so it didn't seem to affect my hair negatively at all. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because I think the price point is a little high for the amount of product you get. You really don't need a lot so a little goes a long way, BUT I feel like there are so many other products that are similar to this product for the price point to be that high."

Plus, the fact that it's free from harsh chemicals is a huge win!  The scent is light and fresh, not overpowering, which is perfect for me.

To preface, I do not use conditioner in the shower as I tend to have greasy roots. I prefer using leave-in conditioner as it keeps my split ends from knotting after brushing. With this being said:   cons: -This product allows me to brush through my split ends and knots much easier, but I also noticed that the ‚Äúmend‚Äù aspect of the product has not helped my hair much. In fact, I have noticed that when I am brushing the knots out of my hair I tend to lose quite a bit of my hair (this is to be expected when brushing knots, but I thought it would lessen due to the expectations of this product).   -The product does not have a strong scent or add any scent really‚Äî my hair smells the same & not any nicer than other leave-in conditioners  (moroccan oil for example smells amazing).   -There hasn‚Äôt been a visible difference in making my curls look better.   pros:  -My hair feels much smoother using this conditioner than without it, and it appears shinier too.   -This conditioner allows me to brush through my hair much easier.   -The softness lasts, so after initially brushing my hair, the second+ times my hair is just as easy to brush through.   Overall:  I feel like this is a nice leave in conditioner & maybe with more time it will repair my hair better, but for the price that it is I do not think it is worth how expensive it is. If it was a bit cheaper it would definitely be better."

In order to expand on my experience using this lightweight product, I want to address each claim Olaplex makes about exactly how it should perform.   ‚Ä¢Leaves hair more manageable- This was definitely the first thing I noticed. I‚Äôm a wash my hair every 3-4 days kinda gal and towards day 4, my frizz is usually outta control. After using this product, my hair seemed much more controlled and my frizz never ramped up.   ‚Ä¢Weightless hydration- this product never weighed down my hair, even when I added an extra pump or two.   ‚Ä¢Hair feels instantly healthier- I actually felt like my hair felt plumper. I definitely noticed it felt thicker.   ‚Ä¢Split-ends look immediately healthier- I agree my hair seemed to feel much smoother and looks much smoother after using this leave-in.   The OLAPLEX No.5 Leave-In‚Ñ¢ Moisturize & Mend Leave-In Conditioner is definitely going to continue to be part of my weekly hair routine."

So I was a bit skeptical about how well Olaplex No.5 Moisturize & Mend Leave-In Conditioner would perform, but it tackled my curls beautifully! I applied a couple pea sized drops and scrunched it into my damp hair, making sure I worked it in through to the ends, and then I let it air dry. Most leave-in treatments I've tried only left residue, flaking, and weighed my hair down. This was not the case with this product. The smell was very pleasing as well and didn't clash with my perfume. I would recommend this product to anyone seeking added hydration and protection prior to their hair routine. **This review was collected as part of a promotion."

The packaging is simplistic and aligned with the Olaplex brand. However, after using it after I shampooed my hair, the Olaplex no. 5 leave in did not disappoint. Just a small amount went a long way. I have mid length, tight, and coily textured hair. So after applying the Olaplex No. 5 leave in conditioner, I immediately noticed the difference in how this product spread and addressed each strand of my hair. You can literally feel the slip and how much better it was to detangle my hair. You can also feel how this leave in conditioner penetrates the hair shaft with moisturizing and quenching my thirsty hair stands. The bonus that separates this from other leave in conditioners is it does all of this with the Olaplex bonding ingredients. Try this for the win. I highly recommend this product."

I found this to be a nice leave-in conditioner when I'm adding other products to my hair. So, this doesn't weigh down my hair on those days. But I prefer a thicker conditioner for my thick coily curls. Although I like the way this makes my hair feel and look, I don't necessarily think you need it. I would rather use a leave in conditioner that's cheaper, but I know works. I think getting a value pack of Olaplex is more worth it because the system seems to work better than by itself. Plus, you'll get more bang for your buck by getting more products than one. Overall, I would recommend trying Olaplex and give this product four out of five stars."

I also used it on my ends (shown in photos) to soften the dryness, which I usually cut off. As someone who regularly uses heat irons to tame my frizzy curls, I have some damage, but this product really helped tame the unruly look without needing to trim as much. I think this is a great dry end softener, which I haven‚Äôt found in the past. Thinner hair types should be cautious with the amount and focus on distribution, especially when using it on wet hair. The smell is pleasant too. With over 30 years in the beauty industry as a licensed esthetician, I‚Äôve tried countless products for healthy-looking hair.

My hair reaches my mid-back and is fine and highlighted. That combination means I need heat protection and something that seals in moisture. I only need about a half a pump for my whole head, so I recommend using less of this product than you initially think you‚Äôll need. No. 5 isn‚Äôt as thick as most leave-ins, and it seems easier to work into the hair than many other leave-ins.   Closing Thoughts: I‚Äôve noticed that my hair is extra soft, but No. 5 is easy to overuse, which makes my hair even straighter than normal. Oddly enough, my hair doesn‚Äôt look or feel nearly as clean on the second and third day post-shampoo, so I have to really be careful how much I use. This may be a unique situation due to my hair‚Äôs fine quality, but it‚Äôs important to note if you also have thin hair. Overall, very nice. 4 stars because it makes it very difficult to create volume when I use this product."

I find it an intense heat protection before using any heating tools. The frizz is gone, and my tress feels soft and shiny. Despite it being highly moisturizing, it is shockingly lightweight and doesn‚Äôt weigh down my curls. I don‚Äôt see any buildup or oiliness as it absorbs quickly, so I see sleeker curls.

I was tired of the end of my hair looking fuzzy. I was amazed at how well Olaplex helped repair the condition of my hair even after the first use! You only need a small amount of this product and I would recommend following the directions on the bottle. I only needed one pump for my hair and i applied it mostly the the mid and ends of my hair. I avoided the roots of my hair because my hair tends to get oily and this can make it worse and weigh your hair down if you over do it. If you have oily hair, I would really suggest to use this on the ends of your hair. The leave in is very thick and may have a light scent that is barely noticeable. I loved how shiny, soft, and smooth Olaplex left my hair. It was easy to brush through and helps to detangle your hair. It does a great     job of sealing the split ends and made my ends smooth and no longer fuzzy! I like that you can use this on wet or dry hair. I also tried it on my hair when dry and it helped to make the ends of my hair smooth and soft. Again, if you use on dry hair. I would recommend only using on the ends, especially if your hair tends to get oily. I also really love that this product helps protect your hair from heat damage and continues to work on sealing your hair after use. I would highly recommend Olaplex Moisture and Mend Leave in Conditioner if you have dry, damaged hair, ir split ends. It will work amazingly well for your hair! *I received this product as part of a promotional review through Beautytap and this is my honest feedback."

This products packaging is right on point, sleek, and modern appeal to the eye. The pump is easy to use as well, making it easy to press one handed if needed.

From the moment I applied it, I noticed the luxurious scent‚Äîfresh, subtle, and pleasant without being overwhelming. It definitely made the experience feel more indulgent.  However, despite the initial promise, I found that the formula was a bit too heavy for my hair type. While Olaplex is renowned for its bond-building technology, this particular product seemed to weigh my strands down, leaving them feeling overly coated rather than nourished. Even with a light application, I noticed my hair appeared flatter than usual, losing its natural bounce and volume.  While I can see this working wonders for someone with thicker or more damaged hair, for me, it was a bit much. I appreciate the effort Olaplex puts into creating high-quality products, but this one just didn‚Äôt mesh well with my routine."

This product has transformed my medium-thick hair, which often struggles with dryness and split ends. Instantly, it detangled my strands and added a stunning shine that I couldn‚Äôt ignore. The high-adhesion sealing complex does wonders at sealing split ends, making my hair feel healthier and softer with each use. I also appreciate the protection against heat damage‚Äîessential for my styling routine. It‚Äôs excellent for regular use and maintenance, but if you have extremely damaged hair, you might need something stronger for more intensive repair.

At least on my hair, this is everything I could have ever asked for -- a true all in one product that replaces the need for a lot of other hair products.

The scent is another plus‚Äîit‚Äôs subtle and pleasant, not overpowering or artificial-smelling. It leaves my hair smelling fresh without clashing with my other hair or body products.  While it‚Äôs a great everyday conditioner, it‚Äôs not a miracle worker. If you have extremely damaged hair, you might need something stronger. However, for regular use and maintenance, it‚Äôs excellent. I‚Äôm giving it four stars because it performs well, but there‚Äôs always room for a bit more improvement.

After trying Olaplex N.5 leave-in conditioner a couple times, it honestly did not wow me in anyway. I thought was going to get the same results as the No. 3, but all it did was tame my frizz a bit and made my hair a little softer. Using a pump a half was enough for my thick Asian hair that‚Äôs past my shoulders. There were times where I tried 3 pumps and that just left my hair looking like I didn‚Äôt wash all the conditioner out. I feel like it‚Äôs trial and error for leave in conditioners like this. Overall, mediocre product; there are better products out there."

I was so excited to be able to try out the OLAPLEX No.5 Leave-In‚Ñ¢ Moisturize & Mend Leave-In Conditioner. I have used Olaplex in the past and have been a really big fan of their product. Although it says it‚Äôs for all hair types, I avoid certain products from them because I feel it‚Äôs too heavy for me since I have very fine hair. I have to say I loved this leave in cream so much more than the number 6. I feel that it‚Äôs more light weight than that one and it definitely doesn‚Äôt feel like I have any product on my hair. I haven‚Äôt had a haircut in some time and my split ends were kicking in and this definitely helped. My hair is extremely smooth too and I feel the difference with just a couple of uses and can‚Äôt wait to see what it continues to do for me!"

The thick, opaque cream is dispensed in generous pumps from the bottle ‚Äî just two pumps is plenty for my thick hair. It has a sweet, fruity scent that‚Äôs pleasant and not overpowering.  When applied on towel-dried hair after washing, it defines my waves and gives them a sleeker look. It also makes my hair feel smoother to the touch. I have tried to use it on my dry ends (as recommended on the bottle), but I haven‚Äôt noticed much of a difference when doing this, as my hair seems not to absorb the product as well when dry. It isn‚Äôt too heavy or greasy, though, so even when applying to dry hair, my strands don‚Äôt look piecy or feel weighed down. While I wish I could see more of a reduction in frizz and split ends, I do love how this conditioner helps define my waves and makes my hair feel softer."

Well, interesting fact here that I am team Olaplex! It definitely wowed me to the point that I am actually excited to try more products now.   Olaplex No.5 Leave-In‚Ñ¢ Moisturize & Mend Leave-In Conditioner has a thicker consistency from all the other leave ins that I tried before, but it is also the most moisturizing leave in product out of all my previous tries. It comes down unruly hair, gives it moisture, shine and manageability and vitality. It is perfect to be used after any shampoo or conditioner and the hair is oh, so soft!"

As someone who's always on the lookout for products that can hydrate and protect my hair, this leave-in conditioner hits all the right notes. It's designed to be reparative, and I can definitely see why. From the first use, it made my hair feel softer and more manageable, while also tackling my split ends. I've noticed a significant improvement in the appearance of my hair since using it. My ends look much healthier, and I no longer have that frizzy, dry look. Hydration is another big plus. I have naturally dry hair, so the added moisture has made a big difference. My hair feels smoother, looks shinier, and is so much easier to brush through after applying this leave-in conditioner. It absorbs quickly, and my hair still feels light and bouncy after use. The Future-Damage Shield is also a huge bonus, as it protects my hair from styling tools that can heat up to 450¬∞F. This has given me peace of mind, knowing my hair is being protected from potential damage every time I blow-dry or straighten it. Overall, I‚Äôm really impressed with the Olaplex No.5 Leave-In‚Ñ¢ Moisturize & Mend Leave-In Conditioner. It‚Äôs hydrating, protective, and truly helps with split ends, making it a great addition to any hair care routine. If you‚Äôre looking for a leave-in conditioner that can moisturize, mend, and protect your hair, I‚Äôd definitely recommend giving this one a try."

			"review_text": "As a long-time user of the Olaplex line and someone with wavy, color-treated hair that features oily roots and dry ends, I've found Olaplex No.5 Leave-In Conditioner to be a fantastic addition to my routine. This product addresses my specific hair needs by delivering deep hydration to my dry ends and helping to balance my hair's overall moisture.  The formula, enriched with OLAPLEX Bond Building Technology, is particularly effective for my highlighted hair. It strengthens and repairs my hair structure, which is essential for maintaining its health and preventing damage. The leave-in conditioner smooths and detangles my waves, leaving them softer and shinier without adding weight. I appreciate that it can be applied to both damp and dry hair, and even on already styled hair the next day, without causing heaviness or buildup.  The lightweight nature of this conditioner ensures that my hair stays grease-free while receiving the moisture it needs. It keeps my waves defined and healthy-looking, avoiding the common heaviness of other leave-in products. While the scent can be a bit strong initially, it fades quickly and doesn't affect the product's effectiveness. By applying it mainly to my mid-lengths and ends, I can enjoy soft, shiny hair while maintaining a balanced scalp.  In conjunction with No.4 Bond Maintenance Shampoo and No.5 Bond Maintenance Conditioner, Olaplex No.5 Leave-In Conditioner has helped me achieve the healthy, manageable, and glossy hair I've been striving for.

A little goes a long way, and just one pump is enough for my waist-length hair. The leave-in not only smells amazing but also delivers on its promises‚ÄîI noticed results after just one use. While it didn‚Äôt magically erase my make my split ends disappear, it did smooth out my hair from root to tip, making the ends look less ‚Äúfrizzy‚Äù and noticeable. Overall, my hair is much easier to style, feels soft to the touch, and looks shiny and healthy.

I was super excited to try their new No.5 Leave-In‚Ñ¢ Moisturize & Mend Leave-In Conditioner because my hair is so dry right now. I love a good leave in conditioner and can't live without them. So far, the Olaplex No.5 Leave-in has done really well. The leave-in conditioner is lightweight and doesn't weigh my hair down at all. My hair feels softer and is much less frizzy than it usually is. I really like the packaging for the No.5 Leave-In‚Ñ¢ Moisturize & Mend Leave-In Conditioner because it doses the right amount of conditioner for your hair type which helps reduce using too much product like everyone does. Two pumps is all I need for my medium thick, coarse hair. Olaplex wins again with another great hair product for all hair types.   This review was collected as part of a promotion"

My red hair is type 2a and tends to be dry and coarse.  I also suffer from a dry scalp if I use products that contain harsh ingredients.  This is a very lightweight leave-in product designed to revive hair, seal split ends and protect hair from future damage.  I used this product immediately after washing and towel drying my hair.  My hair is a bit longer than shoulder length so I split my hair into two sections and applied two pumps to each side.  I allowed my hair to dry naturally, and the end result was amazing.  My hair was super soft and smooth, and my split ends were much less noticeable.  Additionally, it did not irritate my scalp or make it itchy.   The product has a light, pleasant smell that isn‚Äôt overpowering.  As such, I would strongly recommend this product."

Overall, I have found the Olaplex No.5L leave-in does amazing with nourishing, hydrating, and locking in moisture that is very much needed. Like with many other great Olaplex products, I feel that a little bit goes a very long way. After showering, I skip normal conditioning and instead add this leave-in once my hair is still wet but slightly towel dried. To prevent my curls from feeling weighed down or heavy, I apply this leave-in mostly towards the ends of my hair and work it in by brushing it wet as well. I am happy with how hydrated my hair feels, and how healthy it looks now also! I can‚Äôt wait to continue using this product, and I am very satisfied with the formula! "

I did my regular wash day routine with shampoo and rinse out conditioner from a different brand and then applied this leave in conditioner after towel drying my hair. I always apply some product to my hair before detangling to give it some slip and help the comb glide through my hair. On a scale of 1-10 I would give this conditioner a 5 in terms of slip so it probably works better as a detangler for looser hair textures. It did make my hair feel very smooth and moisturized but I had to use way more than the 2 pumps that were suggested for thicker hair types. I love that it also provides heat protection up to 450 because then I don‚Äôt have to apply another product as a heat protectant before blow drying."

My hair felt smoother while running the product through my hair and brushing was a cinch! I did my normal styling routine afterward and was very happy with the results!

I was impressed by how much it helped. When I brushed my hair after it was dry I could still feel that the product was in my hair working to hydrate and repair. After consistent use I feel like the appearance of split ends in my hair has lessened. The number 5 leave in conditioner is a great addition to the line and I can‚Äôt wait to keep this product in my routine."

Recently, I have also noticed some split ends, which has not been an issue for me in the past. I wash my hair twice a week, and tried this product twice. The Olaplex No.5L Moisturize & Mend Leave-In Conditioner for Split Ends is a rich white lotion that smells lightly of candy. I used one pump of this product after my regular shampoo and conditioner. The amount given with one pump was quite a lot, and I was concerned that it would make my hair look greasy. However, after drying, my hair looked more moisturized without being weighed down. It also felt softer and was easier to detangle. Most importantly, the split ends on my hair were gone, but do note that I didn‚Äôt have a ton in the first place. Overall, I could see an improvement in the damage on my hair. I would recommend this product to any hair type looking to revive hair and deal with split ends."

Recently, I have been into using leave-in conditioners.  I have been testing out the Olaplex Moisturizer &Mend Leave-in conditioner for a couple of weeks. I even tested it out when I ran out of my regular conditioner. The Olaplex is best to use on damp hair. The instructions directed me to start off with two pumps but my thick hair requires a little more. It felt natural in my hair and did not leave my hair feeling crunchy. The ends of my hair looked less dry.   I appreciate that the Olaplex leave-in conditioner did not have a strong smell. It felt gentle on my hair. My favorite part is the rinse off the next day when I wash my hair. My hair felt silky like I used a hair mask.   I am usually used to the spray leave-in conditioner but felt that the Olaplex pump allowed me to control my aim better. It is easy to blend into my hair.   I noticed an immediate softness in my hair after styling my hair. This is a perfect product for those that are seeking a high quality leave-in conditioner."

It's a wonderful product that provides protection to the follicle and repair to the ends. The conditioner is a dense cream that soaks into the hair and when brushed, will soften the hair to allow for the hair to curl and return to natural state. My hair curled so easily with the conditioner when it is not as easy for other products. The curls bounced and with my brush, my hair detangled right away. All it took was two pumps per section and my hair was so easy to comb, section, and braid. I held my hair in a protective style for a day and when I removed my braids from the style, my hair was less frizzy and looked shiny all day. I love this product!

Upon receiving the product, I was immediately impressed by its sleek and simple packaging. The soft, minimalist design is sturdy and easy to handle, which is a plus when you‚Äôre using it after a shower. The texture of the leave-in conditioner light yet creamy is a luxurious consistency that spreads easily through the hair without being overly runny or thick. I typically use a coin-sized amount on damp hair after washing with my regular shampoo and condition routine. The first time I applied it, I was impressed with how easily it spread through my hair. My strands felt immediately coated in a veil of hydration. The fragrance is very  pleasant‚Äîwithout being overpowering.  After blow-drying my hair, I noticed an immediate difference. My hair felt softer and silkier to the touch. I can confidently say that it felt as though the frizz and flyaways had been tamed considerably.  I‚Äôve always struggled with dry ends due to my tendency to use heat-style with my hair frequently, but after incorporating the Olaplex No. 5 into my routine, the texture of my hair has improved noticeably. I've used this leave-in conditioner consistently for over a course of a  week three times and I can attest that it does deliver on its promise of moisture.  My hair maintains a healthy shine, it doesn‚Äôt leave a greasy or heavy residue.  On days when I want to wear my hair natural, I can simply apply a bit more product to damp hair and let it air dry; the results are beautifully are just as good.  Over time, I have noticed some lasting benefits. My hair appears healthier and more resilient; split ends are less prominent, and I am experiencing fewer breakages.

Which is why i was so surprised to see the results with Olaplex No 5.   It comes in a small plastic bottle very similar to the rest of the Olaplex line. The leave in conditioner is white in color and the texture is light and creamy. It has a mild fragrance that isn‚Äôt overpowering or unpleasant. I learned after my second try that a little goes a long way. I only needed a small dollop size amount for each section of my hair. It quickly absorbed into my dry and frizzy hair leaving them hydrated. After the first use i could notice the visible difference in my curl pattern. My hair was bouncier and retained my curls for a longer period. This multi functional product not only hydrated my dry, frizzy hair immediately but also continues to repair my cuticles and split ends. It also offers heat protection up-to 450F which is  perfect for me who uses heat tools for styling.   Overall i think this is an amazing product that not only delivers immediate results but also continues to protect your hair. It hydrates dry hair and helps mend split ends that causes frizz for most of us. This has quickly become my go to product after shower and i look forward to using it to heal my hair.

			"review_text": "My hair is usually very dry, especially from medium to ends, it usually gets tangled very easily, I had not tried this type of product such as the olaplex leave in conditioner, but when using it for the first time I could notice a great change in my hair.  The texture of Olaplex No. 5 leave in is creamy and rich, but not excessively heavy, I like to activate the product by passing it through my hands first and then putting it on, this makes the application easier, since it is evenly distributed.  After applying it my hair felt more manageable and with less frizz in addition to providing hydration and control over the hair, the tips were more sealed in an exceptional way, they were not dry as normal, although my hair still felt damaged, the difference is huge After using it, the hair feels significantly more silky and manageable, even my hair looked smoother, this is due to the formula that helps repair the broken loops in the hair, promoting a softer texture and less prone to tangles.  Over time, I hope to find a greater improvement in my hair with the Olaplex No. 5 continuum and notice more changes.  But with this product the hair becomes stronger and less susceptible to future damage. Although the product may be somewhat expensive, the results usually justify the investment, especially if you are looking for a solution for damaged or dry hair.  It is an excellent leave in conditioner that provides deep hydration and effective hair repair."

I have fine hair that I color, and it can become very brittle and dry. However, I struggle to find an effective conditioner that does not weigh down my hair or leave it with residue. The Olaplex No. 5 Leave in Conditioner has been working well for my hair. This leave in conditioner has a light scent that isn‚Äôt overpowering. This acts differently, in that it seems to seal in the moisture instead of just coating my hair. I use one pump after washing my hair. I think this product would be especially effective for someone with extremely dry hair, or very thick hair that does not absorb water or other products well.

First, I have been using this product without a wash out conditioner because I noticed that too much product breaks my hair. When I first put this product in with wet hair, I saw that I had absolutely no breakage. Typically, when I use extra product products in my hair there is some loose hair. After my hair is dry, I noticed that my hair did not dry frizzy as usual. Additionally, when I brushed my hair, I had a lot less fallout than I typically do. My hair remains soft and conditioned throughout two days without washes. I will say that the product did not change the overall appearance of my hair. It will stop breakage to help my hair grow faster. I would recommend this hair product for anyone that is looking for an anti breakage conditioner to help split ends."

The packaging gained my attention, as it had a clear explanation of the benefits it can provide to your hair. This leave-in conditioner is supposed to mend broken strands, leave your hair moisturized, and helps with all hair types. I love how it has a pump, so you don‚Äôt have to worry about the top opening. With the pump, you can control how much product comes out of the package. It has a creamy texture, and a light beautiful scent that is not overpowering to my senses.  It has been a year since I gave birth to my lo, and unfortunately I still experience postpartum shedding. Although my shedding has gotten better since I first experienced it, I still make sure my hair routine contains products that help with moisturization, breakage, and bond repairing. When I applied the leave in conditioner to my hair, It made my curls more defined. It helped with detangling my hair, and provided moisture.    Olaplex can be pretty pricey, so the only way I will purchase it is if there is a sale, or I have reward points to use. I really recommend this product to anyone who is trying to combat shedding. This is a good product for someone who does not like heavy leave in conditioners. This is a nice product for someone who is in between trims, and need something to help with breakage."

So if I want the same beach wave look, Ill grab 6.

I struggle with split ends. I try all of the typical prevention techniques such as not washing it every day and sleeping on a satin pillowcase, air drying and getting a regular trim.  Even so, the split ends persist. This leave in conditioner promises to actually improve hair health and mend split ends, which is exactly what I need. I still saw a few split ends after having just applied this to my damp hair and letting it air dry.  However, overall, there are less of them than I normally see, so I think with regular use I will keep them under control in between hair trims.  I also notice that the ends of my hair feel less dry or stiff, and my hair feels smoother and more hydrated. For my hair type and length the directions recommend one pump.  The pump is quite generous, and I almost felt like I may have only needed half a pump. It has the texture of a lotion, and while it was drying my hair felt slightly tacky, but once it was dry, my hair felt normal again and no feeling of residue or stickiness. I like the smell, which is like a sweet candy, but not overpowering.  For touch ups on my ends on the days I don‚Äôt wash, I only need a small amount and it dries without causing clumping or making my hair look dirty and it has a nice shine.

The texture of the leave-in conditioner was silky and glided pretty easily through my hair. I applied it to my hair while it was wet/slightly damp to help aid in absorption. Once absorbed, I did notice a difference immediately. My hair was softer, and when using heat styling, my hair didn't feel as brittle.

Olaplex has such a great reputation and this leave in conditioner lives up to the talk. I use this on towel dried hair focusing mainly on my ends or anything below my shoulders. It does not weigh down my hair and does not leave it oily or dirty looking like some of these products can. It does, however, leave my hair shiny like a Barbie and extremely silky to the touch. Since I bleach my hair and am also mid 30s with more delicate hair, I try not to use too many heat or styling tools when it isn‚Äôt necessary and this leave in treatment allows me to do so while giving my hair a gorgeous shine that usually takes heat tools to do so.

I enjoy the fresh scent but it sadly goes away quickly and I would mind if it lingered. I have tried using both after shampoo and conditioner and only shampoo and have found my hair feels adequately conditioned skipping conditioner. So if you lean oily you could probably skip conditioner when planning to use this.  Thankfully when using after both shampoo and conditioner it doesn't get my hair/scalp greasy but it doesn't seem necessary.

However, I am remaining hopeful that perhaps this treatments should be used for a longer period of time before making a final determination."

It mends hair and reduces frizz and gets tamed easily while combing or styling. Seals hair and reduces the damage. Makes hair more moisturizing after use. Reduces breakage of hair making it strong and looks healthy. Can be use immediately after washing and hair conditioner. But, my favorite is using it between hair washes to seal and tame split ends. As its leave-in conditioner, easy to use anytime. Can be used on any hair type. Comes in pump packaging so, best for travel use and dispenses required amount of product."

It doesn‚Äôt weigh my hair down or leave it feeling greasy at all, which are issues I‚Äôve had with other leave-in conditioners. After use, my dry and damaged hair feels so soft and hydrated. Typically my hair tangles easily because it‚Äôs so damaged, but with this leave-in conditioner, it feels so smooth and slick.  The formula is enriched with the signature Olaplex bond-building technology, which has noticeably improved the strength and elasticity of my hair. I‚Äôve seen a reduction in breakage, and my hair looks healthier overall. The product does feel a little bit sticky when applying, but once it dries down, it‚Äôs perfectly fine.  The product doesn‚Äôt have a strong scent at all. A little product goes a long way, making the bottle last longer than expected. My hair is very long, but fine so I use one pump on damp hair after every wash. Overall, Olaplex No.5 Leave-In Conditioner has become a new staple in my hair care routine. It‚Äôs perfect for anyone looking to nourish, protect, and repair their hair while maintaining a lightweight feel. Highly recommend it for anyone with damaged hair!"

That's why I was so excited to try the new Olaplex No.5 leave-in conditioner.  The pump bottle made it easy to dispense the right amount; I used four pumps along my waist-length damp hair. It felt incredibly lightweight and instantly added shine and hydrated my dry ends. Even with the summer humidity, it helped to reduce frizz and kept my hair looking sleek and manageable. My hair was transformed after just one use!  I'm so happy to have finally tried Olaplex. It's now an essential part of my hair care routine for taming my normally unmanageable hair.

The pump top is easy to use and gives a good amount of product. It has a creamy texture and kind of a minty scent to me but fades quickly.    I applied it after towel drying my hair, let it set a few minutes, then did a full blowout. I love that it's also a heat protectant. My hair was much easier to brush right after application. My hair has been so incredibly soft since the very first use. Slit ends are way less noticeable and my hair looks and feels healthy, and shiny, despite the constant heat styling. I would absolutely recommend No.5L Moisture and Mend Leave in Conditioner for Slit Ends by Olaplex. Great product!"

Based on my before and after pictures, I can see my hair has changed from looking messy to a more uniformed appearance.    I personally have fine hair.  It does tend to be less manageable and frizzy sometimes.  But after applying this product, my hair has been so easy to brush through without any hassles of tangles.  This product creates a soft and smooth feel on my hair.  After I brush, my hair looks more uniform and less frizzy.    The best part is this product does not weigh down my fine hair, instead, it makes my hair feel so lightweight and bouncy.  I feel a sense of volume and free flowing hair.  I also love how this keeps my hair feeling soft and hydrated even after I use a blow dryer on my hair.  Usually, the heat from the dryer would cause my hair to feel dry afterwards.  But since using this product, my hair looks and feels less dry.   It has a slightly pleasant scent.    The texture is a light lotion that absorbs and blends into the hair right away.  I feel no greasy residue afterwards.  This product leaves my hair shiny and healthy looking.  After trying this product, I would say this is great for all hair types, especially best suitable for curly and frizzy hair.      Overall, I have had a lovely experience every time I used this product.  As an esthetician, promoting healthy skin is my forte.  If I experience a hair care product that does healthy things to hair as well, I would highly approve of the product and this Olaplex No. 5 Leave - In - Conditioner has my approval."

This has replaced my normal conditioner and I feel as if this product will be something that I will use for a long time. I already feel my hair is softer after using this. I am going through a hair growth journey so this product is perfect for me because I have dealt with split ends and breakage before. I can't say enough amazing things about this product and I'm excited about the long term benefits of this."

			"review_text": "As a skin and hair care enthusiast, I recently tried the Olaplex No.5 Leave-In‚Ñ¢ Moisturize & Mend Leave-In Conditioner, and I must say, it has quickly become a staple in my hair care routine. Finding a leave-in conditioner that hydrates without weighing down my hair has always been a challenge as someone with fine hair that tends to get frizzy and dry at the ends. This product, however, truly delivers on its promises.  The conditioner has a lightweight, almost creamy texture that absorbs quickly into my hair without leaving any greasy or sticky residue. After the first use, I noticed an immediate difference‚Äîmy hair felt softer, more manageable, and significantly less frizzy. The weightless hydration is a game-changer for fine hair like mine, as it provides the moisture my hair needs without making it feel limp or heavy.  One of the standout features is how it instantly makes my hair feel healthier. My ends, which often feel dry and prone to split, look smoother and more polished after using this product. I love that I can also apply it to dry ends between washes to keep them looking fresh and healthy. The scent is light and pleasant, not overpowering, which is perfect for those who prefer a subtle fragrance in their hair products. I've also found that it works beautifully as a base before applying other styling products, ensuring my hair stays hydrated and protected throughout the day.  Overall, the Olaplex No.5 Leave-In‚Ñ¢ Moisturize & Mend Leave-In Conditioner is an excellent addition to any hair care regimen, especially for those with fine to medium hair types."

When it comes to hair care, Olaplex is hands-down one of the best I‚Äôve ever tried. And now, with their latest addition‚Äîthe Olaplex No. 5 Leave-In Conditioner‚ÄîI am blown away once again.  My hair has always been prone to dryness, especially at the ends, leading to frequent split ends. But this conditioner has been a game-changer. My ends are feeling more nourished than ever, and it's been a huge help in preventing further damage. Honestly, this product couldn‚Äôt have come at a better time! I‚Äôm planning to go blonde soon, and we all know how much of a toll that can take on your hair. So, having this treatment in my routine is a lifesaver. It's helping me keep my hair healthy and strong, particularly where it needs it most‚Äîthe ends.  If you‚Äôre dealing with damaged hair or battling persistent dryness like me, especially at the ends, this is the holy grail you‚Äôve been searching for! The instant I apply it, I can feel my hair softening. It becomes silky smooth, and once I dry it, it‚Äôs incredibly manageable‚Äîno more frizz or rough texture. Not to mention the extra shine it brings! I love how versatile it is too. I can use it on damp hair after washing, but it works equally well on dry hair. I like to apply a small amount to my dry ends to protect them from splitting, and it‚Äôs been nothing short of amazing.  I genuinely can‚Äôt recommend Olaplex No. 5 Leave-In Conditioner enough if you have damaged or dry hair. It‚Äôs been transformative for me, especially in keeping my ends from looking and feeling brittle. Trust me, this will change your hair for the better!"

One full pump is more than enough for my shoulder-length hair. The texture is creamy but feels too thick for a leave-in conditioner. I applied it and let my hair air-dry, and noticed a slight crunch. The crunch disappeared when I used a flat iron, and I achieved very desirable results. My hair feels soft and somewhat fuller, yet I can still tell there is heavy cream product weighing it down. I think this would be ideal for very thick, coarse hair and damaged hair. For fine hair, it seems too much. I'll try a little less than a full pump next time and see if that makes a difference. This is a product that I feel requires some amount of experimentation to really see the benefits."

I used this product in place of conditioner, and after shampooing my hair. I let my hair air dry. Usually when my hair air dries, I have poofiness that needs tamed with a wax stick. Well, I didn't need my wax after using this Olaplex product! Photo 2: On another way day, I used the leave in conditioner after both shampoo and conditioner. I wanted to know if it was going to be too much in addition to my regular conditioner. Well, I'm happy to report that my hair wasn't greasy like I thought it could potentially be.

I'm not the biggest fan of leave-in conditioners because of my fine hair. But this conditioner impressed me because I didn't get greasy or flat hair after using it. This conditioner is meant to help with detangling the hair and conditioning the hair. It smells good like some kind of soap. But the product doesn't make my hair softer or heavier. It is like I'm not using anything after applying it. I got more volume on my hair and it helped me a little bit with detangling. But sadly, I didn't see too much of a difference in my hair. I was expecting to get softer or healthier hair. I applied the conditioner on my ends and half of my hair. The hair dries and it looks the same as other days. After one or two days, it gets more moisture and looks like the after picture. I would recommend this conditioner because it didn't make my hair worse. I would recommend this product to people with fine hair or greasy hair. It feels very lightweight so it will help with volume. This review was collected as part of a promotion."

I have dry hair and after returning from my Summer holidays, my hair were even more dry. Between the sun and the swimming pool, and the air conditioner from the long flights, my hair were very dry. I decided to try first the olaplex leave-in conditioner on my hair ends that were not wet. They were so dry that I needed something to style them and moisturize them before exiting home. I used 1 pump and my hair felt instantly moisturized ! They got the weightless hydration needed without greasy results.  I also tried the olaplex leave-in conditioner on my clean, damp hair. Then I used my different hair tools. I love that that product protects my hair from styling damages and heat tools. My hair results after using olaplex were hydration and shine.  I love the texture of the product and it has a very light scent that smells very good and leaves a nice scent on my hair.  The olaplex leave-in conditioner is a very good quality hair product. I look forward to keep using the olaplex leave-in conditioner to help my hair get healthier, continue to moisturize my hair, and repair my split-ends.  this review was collect as part as a promotion"

Following my shower and towel-drying, I dispense two pumps onto my hands to cater to my thick hair. I work the product through the ends of my hair with my fingers and then proceed to brush it with my preferred brush. The conditioner has notably enhanced the softness of my hair having it more touchable and minimizes the post-shower tangles while using it  in a noticeably brief period. It's a lot easier to comb or brush through my hair now. Although I do wish it had a more appealing scent, I still appreciate its effectiveness and the benefits it provides for my thick hair. So I'll take effectiveness over a more enjoyable fragrance. This review was collected as part of a promotion."

This product claims to hydrate and soften hair, as well as detangles and sealing split ends up to 88%. This leave-in conditioner is a great size at 3.3 fluid ounces, and a little definitely goes a long way so this bottle will last me quite a while. I personally only used one pump, and I have very long hair. I did notice my hair was less tangled and when it dried my hair looked much healthier than normal. It was shiny but not greasy and it did not weigh my hair down either! This leave-in also has a wonderful scent that I really enjoyed. I would recommend this leave-in conditioner to anyone, but especially those with split ends and or damaged hair!"

Once I received my product I did a quick shampoo to a small section & used a blowdyer on warm as I don‚Äôt normally put any heat because my hair is already brittle. I started with a small amount & kept added as needed. Unfortunately I never got the results I was hoping for. It definitely made my hair softer.

Of course after towel-drying my hair, my hair looked and felt quite coarse.  The instructions stated to use one to two pumps depending on hair thickness.  As my hair Is very fine, I only used one pump.  I distributed throughout my hair from mid-shaft to the ends.  During this process, my hair felt immensely more hydrated, softer, and smoother.  Due to the condition of my hair, I have only been allowing it to air-dry.  When it was dry, my hair felt so healthier and stronger!  It was actually shiny!"

I‚Äôve always admired Olaplex and the amount of science and technology that they put into their products. I recently tried the Olaplex no 5 leave-in conditioner and could not love it more. A little bit of it goes a long way and the texture melts into your hair. I have below shoulder length hair and I used a pump of the product and it was perfect. The scent is very typical of any olaplex product and lingers on your hair for at least a couple of days which i love! It can be used as a leave-in and it doubles as a heat protectant for upto 450F, I love how versatile it is! I didnt really feel the need to use a serum after I was done styling since this already left my hair feeling very smooth. It tames frizz and makes your hair very shiny! I‚Äôm not sure if it did much for my split ends but i will definitely continue to use this to see if it makes a difference! I would highly recommend this to anyone looking to add a leave-in to their routine."

			"review_text": "Every time I try an Olaplex product I know it's going to be very hard not to fall in love with it. And in this case the leave conditioner has quickly become one of my favorites for my 3b curly hair. I really like that it leaves my hair well moisturized, with defined curls and no frizz but not at all oily or sticky like I usually get with other products. My hair is long and 2 pumps are more than enough to cover my curls evenly. I apply it from mid-lengths to ends, I prefer to avoid the roots because that way my hair gets the necessary volume and doesn't get flattened. My curls stay intact until the next wash, just wet them, untangle them, style them and that's it. This is the perfect leaving conditioner for my curly hair. I get a fresh look every day without needing to apply more product."

			"review_text": "As a 59-year-old post-menopausal female, my hair has suffered from dryness, dullness, and lots of frizzy split ends for quite some time. That's why I was so excited to receive this new leave-in treatment.  After using it for just a week, I have already noticed a significant difference in the texture and appearance of my hair. The leave-in treatment helped to restore moisture and shine, making my hair look healthier and more vibrant.  I also noticed that my hair felt softer and more manageable, with fewer tangles and frizz. I love how easy it is to use - just a small amount applied to damp hair and I'm good to go. It doesn't make your hair look greasy or oily either. Just beautiful healthy hair.  Overall, I am extremely happy with the results and will be incorporating this leave-in treatment into my hair care routine. Thank you, Olaplex, for creating such a fantastic product!"

			"review_text": "As someone who's battled with frizzy, color-treated hair for years, I've tried my fair share of leave-in conditioners. When OLAPLEX announced their No.5 Leave-In‚Ñ¢ Moisturize & Mend Leave-In Conditioner, I was intrigued but skeptical. Could it really live up to the hype of the OLAPLEX name?  When I first got my hands on the sleek white bottle, I was impressed by the packaging. The pump dispenser is a godsend for my clumsy morning routine. The product itself has a creamy texture that feels luxurious between my fingers. I was pleasantly surprised by the subtle scent ‚Äì as someone sensitive to strong fragrances, I appreciated that it wasn't overpowering.  For context, my hair is long, thin, and naturally wavy with a tendency to frizz. Years of highlighting have left it prone to dryness and breakage. My main hair goals are moisture, frizz control, and repairing damage from heat styling and color treatments.  The product spreads easily through my hair, and I can immediately feel it smoothing out any tangles. This alone has been a game-changer for me. Gone are the days of wincing as I try to comb through wet hair!  The first thing I noticed was how much easier it was to style my hair. Whether I'm air-drying for a natural wave or blow-drying for a sleeker look, my hair is noticeably more manageable. The frizz that usually appears as my hair dries is significantly reduced, and I'm left with softer, smoother strands.  My color looks more vibrant, and there's a shine to my hair that I haven't seen in years. I attribute this to the moisture-locking properties of the product and the famous OLAPLEX bond-building technology."

			"review_text": "This review was collected as part of a promotion.  Another winner for Olaplex.  I color my hair frequently and looking for items to keep my hair healthy and soft.  I have tried the other Olaplex products which work well and was happy to give this leave-in conditioner a try.  It worked well right off the bat.  I could feel my hair absorb this and condition after towel drying it.  It was not heavy and really conditioned it.  It didn't leave my hair heavy or greasy and a little goes a long way.  I used about half a pump since I have short hair.  The scent is clean and fresh and not overly heavy but is the same scent as most of their other products.  It works well with other styling products and hairstyle was easily attained.  I would definitely purchase this again."
