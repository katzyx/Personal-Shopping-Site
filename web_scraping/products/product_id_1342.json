	"ingredients": "Alcohol Denat., Parfum (Fragrance), Aqua (Water), Benzyl Salicylate, Linalool, Hydroxycitronellal, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Limonene, Benzyl Benzoate, Citronellol, Coumarin, Geraniol, Alpha-Isomethyl Ionone, Cinnamyl Alcohol, Alcohol, Tris(Tetramethylhydroxypiperidinol) Citrate, Farnesol, Citral, Benzyl Alcohol, Ci 19140 (Yellow 5), Ci 14700 (Red 4), Ci 42090 (Blue 1).",
	"how_to_use": "Suggested Usage:.-Fragrance is intensified by the warmth of your own body. Apply in the creases of your knees and elbows for a longer-lasting, stronger scent.&nbsp;.-After applying, avoid rubbing or dabbing skin. This breaks down the fragrance, causing it to wear off more quickly.&nbsp;.-If you prefer placing fragrance on your wrists, be sure to reapply after frequent hand-washing, as this tends to rinse off the scent.&nbsp;.-Replace fragrance after 12 months. Expired perfumes more than a year old lose the integrity of the original scent... Eau de Toilette or Eau de Parfum?: .The difference lies in the volume of perfume oil. While EDT contains five to nine percent, EDP contains more, usually eight to 14 percent. EDPs, therefore, last longer and smell more intense.",

I can smell it on myself but others cannot. Pretty disappointing being that this is the version that’s supposed to be stronger than the silver bottle."

It has a floral scent with notes of Jasmine and Musk. I wear this more often in the evening time as I feel it suits me better than the day. However it lasts super long and I can still smell it on my clothes the next day."

The projection of the spray is very precise so there is no waste. This is a perfume you can wear anywhere and since you can go far with only one spray is a great choice. Will definitely buy again"

Then, it warms up with a sprinkle of benzoin, adding a nice warmth. If you’re not a fan of super strong incense (same here!), fear not! This scent blends it in just right, giving you a hint of spicy goodness without being overpowering. It’s like the perfect secret ingredient that makes you go, “Ooh, what’s that?!” I also usually find jasmine a bit too much, but they nail it with just the right amount. It adds a lovely floral touch without being in-your-face.  I find this scent strong, and 2-3 spritz’s will do the job to have you smelling deliciously sexy throughout the whole day. Fame could actually be worn day or night, which I love. It’s overall SO pretty and a beautiful addition to my fragrance collection."

A strong opening note of mango that quickly dries down to a jasmine incense musk. It is warm and inviting and perfect for a night out. It would be safe to use as an every day fragrance as it has a good balance between floral and musk. The longevity is decent and lingers on the skin for several hours. I received many compliments from friends when wearing this. If you enjoy Kilian’s Love, Don’t Be Shy or Can’t Stop Loving You then you’re likely to enjoy this perfume.

This scent blends it in just right, giving you a hint of spicy goodness without being overpowering. It’s like the perfect secret ingredient that makes you go, “Ooh, what’s that?!” I also usually find jasmine a bit too much, but they nail it with just the right amount. It adds a lovely floral touch without being in-your-face.  I find this scent strong, and 2-3 spritz’s will do the job to have you smelling deliciously sexy throughout the whole day. Fame could actually be worn day or night, which I love. It’s overall SO pretty and a beautiful addition to my fragrance collection."

I find it to be quite light and airy, not too heavy or dense. It has longevity and lasts throughout the day, I like to apply it to my neck and my wrists, and I am able to smell it throughout the whole day. It does slightly dissipate after the hours go on, but I can still smell this by dinner time when I put it on at 6:00. A.m.! The packaging is a little odd, but that's not something that bothers me. I do really like the combination of the gold and the black. Overall, I would recommend this perfume to someone else and will continue to use it to completion."

I find it intense woody chypre with a hint of jasmine, incense, and slight musk. It’s described as a warm floral however I find it more to be a warm vanilla. Genuinely the mango leaves a warm yet kind of sweet scent to the skin whilst not overpowering the jasmine. I find because of the incense it is a long lasting perfume and even though it is a bit pricy, it is definitely worth the money as you don’t need a lot for it to last ! I sprayed one tester spray to wear on my wrist to test longevity and it was very solid until hour 8. The scent was very much still present but more on the lighter side at around 10h of wear. Also, the packaging is so cute and chic."

The iconic design of the bottle is truly captivating with its robot shape that perfectly captures Pacco Rabannes futuristic style. The scent not smells exquisite on the skin but also looks fantastic on a vanity table. It is a versatile fragrance that lasts all day and is perfect for those who appreciate a blend of warm floral and fruity notes.

I love that the bottle does not have a cap (so no losing it!), the spray button is located conveniently on the top of the bottle and really easy to use. It sprays the perfect amount every time. I personally like a few sprays so you can use to your desired taste.   I really enjoyed the musky jasmine scent and for me, the smell is not too strong – just enough where it lingers and keeps you smelling good all day. I had lots of compliments and scent stayed on pretty much throughout the day.   Personally, I would pay good money for a perfume I really enjoy and I would definitely purchase this again!

I love the little robot bottle, it's pretty fun.   Received this from Influenster but all opinions my own."

The design alone is impressive—it’s sleek, modern, a striking geometric shape that looks like a piece of contemporary art.  Its just not the bottle but fragrance too. When I first apply it, I get a juicy burst of mango, which is really refreshing. As it dries down, the jasmine comes through, adding a sophisticated floral touch. The incense at the base gives it a warm, cozy feel that sticks around for hours.  What's impressive is how well the fragrance clings to my clothes and skin throughout the day. It lingers gently but noticeably, offering a continuous, pleasant aroma that doesn't overpower. It's perfect for making a lasting impression. If you’re into floral scents with a bit of warmth and depth, this is definitely worth trying!  I received this product for free"

Once it dries down a bit I smell more of the “mango” and some vanilla smell, which I prefer over the strong floral. At first smell, this probably isn’t a scent I would purchase, but once dried down I love it. Overall, I’m happy to have given it a try and love the luxurious feel of it! It is a little pricy for me to repurchase, but if you’re looking for a luxurious feeling perfume to have in your repertoire, this is a great one to try.

Although marketed as a feminine perfume, this is very much a unisex perfume. My boyfriend and I have both worn this scent. I tend to like scents that are a little more florally or sweet in nature, however, this fragrance has grown on me. It smells very tropical in the beginning, in a neither masculine or feminine way- very neutral. It does dry down to be more vanilla later on. I love the base scent although I don’t particularly love the initial scent. It dries down to a sensual, and warm scent that is elegant and pleasant. The longevity of this fragrance is amazing- it lasts all day and I can smell it on my clothes still when I do my laundry a few days later. The packaging is super cute, it would definitely be a staple piece on any vanity or dresser."

I do wish it lasted longer, unsure if it was due to the size being a small sample or not. Beware,the more you spray on...m the stronger it will be!! Does take a little bit to tone down. I'm good with like 3 sprays, more than that it alot for me. Would definitely consider buying this."

It is a very soft, delicate scent - mostly Jasmine with a hint of musk,  and not the least bit overbearing as one might assume from a scent called Fame.  As the day goes on, I noticed that it almost has a vanilla note to it.   It is very understated in the best way, and it makes me smile when I smell it - both from the familiarity of and the loveliness of the scent.

I would be very surprised if anyone ever complained that this was too heavy. It seems like a scent that would work for a lot of different people, so it would work well as a gift.  When I put it on in the morning, it was mostly gone by mid-afternoon, but it lasted fairly well on clothing.  Due to the price point, that is why I give it a 3, because I would expect it to last longer.  I prefer a more powerful scent, but this is nice for someone looking for something subtle."

This fragrance is probably best enjoyed on cooler summer nights, when the tropical aspect is appropriate but the temperature doesn’t make the depth of the scent too overwhelming.

The scent is unique and captivating, and it lasts all day without being overwhelming.  The first thing that caught my attention was the packaging. The bottle is sleek and elegant, with a touch of edginess with its black and gold design. It definitely stands out on my vanity and adds a touch of luxury to my collection.  The scent itself is a perfect blend of sweet and spicy notes. The top notes of mandarin and pink pepper give it a refreshing and fruity kick, while the heart notes of vanilla and coffee add a warm and sensual touch. The base notes of patchouli and cedarwood give it a woody and earthy undertone, making it a well-rounded and complex fragrance.  What I love most about this perfume is its longevity. I only need a few sprays in the morning and it lasts throughout the day. I have received numerous compliments while wearing it, with people asking what scent I am wearing.  The only downside to this perfume is that it may be too strong for some people. It is a powerful and bold scent, so I would recommend spraying it lightly to avoid it from being overwhelming.  Overall, I highly recommend the Paco Rabanne Fame Parfum for anyone looking for a unique and long-lasting scent. It is perfect for both day and night wear, and it will definitely make you stand out in a crowd. I will definitely be purchasing this fragrance in the future."

I would say 1-2 spritzes would be plenty to last you a good while. I would say it lasts a good couple of hours. Of course as the day goes on it won’t be as strong as it originally way. It especially depends on the activities you’re doing like sweating a lot. This is a fragrance that I would actually buy for myself. I would definitely recommend this for people to try if you want a mature and floral scent."

For example, today I put it on at 6:30am, and at 2:30pm (even after going to the animal shelter and a restaurant) all I can smell is this perfume. It’s not quite my style for daily wear, but it has a deep, sexy scent that would meld perfectly for a romantic night out."

When I initially sprayed it, the scent was very strong, but became a musky, woody scent fairly quickly.  I really like the scent, it is not a strong flowery scent and is more earthy  The scent lasts a long time and  I can still smell it on my clothes the next day.  Love it!!!!"

It's like a tropical blast that screams, Let's get this fiesta started! Seriously, it's the kinda entrance you want at every shindig.  Jasmine and Olibanum. Now, I ain't a flower expert, but these two are like the Beyoncé and Jay-Z of the perfume world. Jasmine brings the floral drama, while Olibanum adds this creamy, smoky thing that's lowkey addictive. Can't lie, I'm here for it. As the night goes on, Fame wraps you in Sandalwood and Vanilla. It's like a warm, sweet hug that lingers. You know when you walk past and someone's like, Dang, who smells amazing? Yeah, that's the Fame effect.  And the bottle? So Pretty! It’s not just a bottle; it's a statement piece."

As someone who is not a fan of floraly scents this is perfect for me.  I feel this perfume wears well for both day and night.  My husband loves when I put this one on.  I feel the scent stays on well throughout the day while not smelling overpowering.  I would definitely recommend this perfume."

I think it’s more of a summery scent but it’s not too ‘loud’ so it can be totally worn all year round. The opening it’s creamy mango and bergamot in the dry down I can smell vanilla and kind of coconut even though it’s not listed in the notes. It’s a lovely summery feel good scent. It lasts 6+ hours on my skin. The silage it’s moderate which is good. I really like this smell and will repurchase after finishing this bottle."

The top notes I picked up was bergamot, jasmine, and some fruitiness from the mango.  Although the scent didn’t last the whole day, which I didn’t mind. A good six hours in, it was still pretty good but did mellow out in the lasting hours to a more lighter vanilla and floral scent which was very nice. The fragrance provides a femininity that I like, which also the brand advertises. It also gives off sensual vibes. I felt confident knowing I smelled good. My friend complimented me too.  I can’t forget about the design of the bottle! It looks elegant on my dresser. The chain mail dress design is so unique. I would recommend this as a Christmas gift for sure.

I like it that you can wear it for both day and night time due to it’s musky and mangoe tone, It’s my new addition to the vanity but I think it’s little pricy , we could get similar kind of fragrance in little lower price , but over all I’m happy with it"

It is also extremely good for long term wear lasting for an entire day and night out with friends, and that was just 2 sprays, one on each wrist, I can definitely understand the price point as will easily last months as long as you aren't over doing it at each use."

The bottle looks great on my vanity and you'd never know it's perfume! The scent is very tropical and floral with a touch of intrigue and drama. It's very lightweight and warm which makes it perfect for everyday wear. But it doesn't last that long. However, if you're looking for full on drama, intrigue and sensuality I recommend Lady Million Royal. Both perfumes have become go to in my daily life, one for the daytime/work/ and the other for events or when I want to feel mysterious.  I loved the Fame scent and this makes the perfect everyday perfume plus again the bottle is just so so cute! The scent may not be long-lasting but the memory of it sure will be.

Let me start by saying, I am a bit picky with the scents I wear because some do tend to trigger my migraines, but this has been amazing! Going into winter I had been looking for a scent with a cozy warm scent, and this is just that! It has amazing warm floral notes, that are just right without being too overbearing. I like that I can smell warm and cozy without it being too overwhelming. It’s still a mature scent, so that’s a huge bonus because i find that sometimes warm scents tend to be too overpowering. The fragrance itself also lasts a long time, I’ve worn it to work and just while running errands and it seems so stick. Another plus is the packaging - I love fragrances that have great packaging because i display them on my dresser and this looks great alongside my other perfumes. Overall, if you’re looking for a mature warm cozy long lasting scent, I’d definitely recommend this one!"

When I first opened it, I sprayed it into the air to give it a smell and all I got was mango. Once I sprayed it on my skin and let it settle for 10 mins or so, it transforms into a sweet, musky fragrance that is very pleasant.  It lasts well throughout the day (I can still smell it on my wrists at the end of the day) and transforms to be more woody as time goes on. It’s not my favourite for winter, but I will absolutely bring it out for a fresh summer scent. Its also worth noting it is very strong- one spray is enough, two is a bit overpowering but passable, and three is entirely too much."

First, the bottle: designed after one of Paco Rabanne's designs, this bottle calls back the fun and beauty in perfume bottles as collector pieces. The scent itself is perfect for late fall/early winter as the jasmine and musk notes intermingle with the mango notes. In terms of longevity I found it did last about four hours. What I like is that this is the type of perfume where if it mixes well with your body chemistry you don't need too much and the notes linger all day (even after the majority dissipates after 4 hours). I would totally recommend this as a gift for the perfume lover who likes daring-yet-whimsical fruity/musk matchups in a perfume."

After testing this perfume out for the last week or so, I found that the main talking point was its longevity. After an 8 hour work shift, I still had people asking me what perfume I was wearing! I was absolutely shocked.   With the main notes being mango, jasmine and incense, I found that this combination was absolutely wonderful. After all, I am a sucker for jasmine scents. Considering I'm trying to write this review from an unbiased standpoint I will give it an original 5 stars. However, when comparing this perfume to the others in the Paco Rabanne collection, I'll have to say that Lady Million Fabulous has to be the winner in comparison to fame by smell alone. Given it's longevity, it's new and improved packaging (I absolutely love the little robot, I think it's adorable) when compared to other Paco Rabanne perfumes (the pointy diamond shape was a tad awkward) I do have to give this perfume a solid five stars. I simply have no complaints about it, and will be keeping this in my growing collection of Paco Rabanne perfumes!

The scent is seductive with tropical under notes and is long lasting. You start off with a musky jasmine scent which slowly starts to blend into a more mango like smell. I can't wait to use it in the summer or on my next beach destination vacation, Its definitely an addictive fragrance!"

I know a lot of people think paco rabanne packaging is tacky, and I agree for some, but I find the fame bottle adorable. I will say that generally my experience with paco rabanne atomizers has not been the greatest (anything less than a full spray will come out as a stream of liquid). Onto the perfume, fame opens with a very strong mango top note. It’s not a fresh mango, but reminds me more of mango candy. Personally, I find the opening a bit cloying but luckily it fades quite quickly on the skin after a few minutes. The mango does stick around for a while on clothes though. Once the top notes fade, the perfume settles into a sweet, creamy floral and pretty much stays that way except I find it gets more powdery with wear. Nothing special about the dry down, I find it a very generic inoffensive floral. Sillage is moderate, and longevity is also nothing remarkable although the scent lasts much longer on clothes. I could see this being someone’s everyday perfume, although it might lean a bit heavy in warmer weather. Personally, it’s not exactly my cup of tea but I can see why people would enjoy this."

I like the button to spray, It doesn’t spray too much perfume out at a time. On first spray it smelled kinda spicy, warm, musky on me. I was hoping for the mango or sweet notes to come out on my skin but, they never did. After it dried down it was a lot nicer, soft and more powdery but still a hint of musk. My mom tried and more sweet notes came out on her. Neither of us were fans of this perfume, it was just too musky and powdery where I prefer more floral/fruit scents. This does seem like a more “mature” scent. This fragrance is long lasting but does dry down more light. I’m sure on others this would smell lovely, but unfortunately warm, musk, powder scents smell horrible with my skin chemistry. I was happy to try this though, thank you Influenster & Paco Rabanne for the opportunity!"

As it settles, there's this lovely floral vibe that's both girly and fierce.   What's unique is that I'm not a fan of florals – most of my perfumes are vanilla and woody. But this one stands out and is perfect for those of us who usually steer clear of florals. It's not overbearing and the perfect middle.   THE LONGEVITY!!!!!  Very few scents manage to stick around on me, and it's always a struggle. However, Fame is one of the rare few that has lasted all day without needing a reapplication.  I feel it will stick around in my collection for 7 years like their Olympia. Paco Rabanne Fame has officially overtaken the competition and is my everyday for the season!"

I am extremely pick when it comes to fragrance and was worried this was going to be a miss - I was (mostly) wrong. I love sweet scents and when you first spray this, it gives a very sweet, vanilla-leaning woodier floral smell. However, after it blends into my body chemistry after some time, I find I pick up significantly more on the floral notes and the perfume becomes a scent profile I would typically shy away from. I would not recommend this for someone who wants to emphasize the woodier, muskier scent profiles. This is very much so for the ones who appreciate the more conventional floral scents with a little twist. Overall, though, I would continue to wear this. I find it a great choice for both an occasion as it feels classic, elegant, and elevated with the florals as well as a more casual evening because it can be cut with the sweeter notes - It feels feminine and fun for a girls’ night on the town.   I find the bottle is a little gimmicky, but it’s a very cute and unique piece to have out on your vanity or in your bathroom because it’s so elaborate in design. It would be a cute gift for someone who appreciates unique bottle designs. The bottle sprays well despite this design and I’m happy it isn’t a nuisance or impractical. It has a sturdy design and I am not afraid it will topple over accidentally."

Mango are in the DNA of each scent, but due to the blend of musk and jasmine added to the Parfum, I find myself sniffing this one ever so more than the EDP. It finds itself in a great balance between sweetness and edge. The bottle is very fun and spraying it is easy. I enjoy the black sequin element. This is a very versatile and inoffensive fragrance, so you can wear is any occasion you see fit. Personally, due to the deeper element of the Parfum, it will be a nighttime scent for me! Just because it’s fruity doesn’t limit it to being just a summer fragrance. While the EDP is a 3.5-4 star in my books, this one comes to a 5/5."

			"review_text": "This is a very summery, mature fragrance. I own a lot of perfumes and am familiar with all different notes and genres of fragrance, I will say this is not my taste but objectively I can appreciate this scent and can see how a lot of people would like it.   True to the original FAME EDP, mango is the prominent note in this fragrance. The other note that sticks out to me is the jasmine, it adds a sharpness to the scent, which I think is what I don’t like for me personally, since I’m pretty picky with my florals. This is in the same category as Mugler Alien Goddess, it has the same « sunscreen » type vibe, I almost detect some coconut in here even though it’s not listed as a note.  These types of scents are perfect for summer, especially hot climates by the beach! It is unfortunately winter here in Canada but I think perhaps I’ll enjoy it more in the summer months. The best part about this fragrance is its longevity, I only sprayed twice and 12 hours later I can very much still smell it. A lot of these tropical scents are light and fade easily, this one is perfect if you like the original FAME but want something louder, that projects and lasts longer!  Full honesty, I genuinely think most people would like FAME Parfum though, as long as you’re into florals. It’s a safe, mass-appealing scent, not the most unique but an easy grab nonetheless.   Received product from Influenster in exchange for my honest review. This does not affect my honesty, I try being as objective as possible in my reviews."

From the first spray, you can distinctly smell the mango note along side some vanilla. I’d been looking for a fruity scent that doesn’t scream summertime because of its overly fresh scent but also isn’t a headache giver and this is exactly that. I would call this a cozy tropical scent perfect for winter season, it’s not overpowering but has amazing projection. I sprayed this on around 3pm and could still smell it at midnight. When it dries down, the musky note peaks and becomes more prominent."

I received this parfumé a few days ago and have been testing it and wearing it so that I could give a thorough review. First impressions off the bat, cutest packaging I’ve ever seen for a parfumé bottle. It looks so nice on my counter. But more importantly, what’s the smell like? Well I’ll try my best to explain but it’s such a seductive smell without being over the top. You have the slight notes of floral but not too much! Meanwhile you get that woody musk coming in. It’s so nice, I’m 25 and I feel like it’s my new signature scent. I feel like this parfumé will compliment anyone of any age since it’s not too overpowering. I wore it out again last night, and it lasted so long that I could still smell it on me this morning. I only did one spray!! Talk about long lasting. Highly recommend!!"
