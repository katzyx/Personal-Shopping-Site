    "ingredients": "Alcohol Denat., Parfum (Fragrance), Aqua (Water), Benzyl Salicylate, Linalool, Hydroxycitronellal, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Limonene, Benzyl Benzoate, Citronellol, Coumarin, Geraniol, Alpha-Isomethyl Ionone, Cinnamyl Alcohol, Alcohol, Tris(Tetramethylhydroxypiperidinol) Citrate, Farnesol, Citral, Benzyl Alcohol, Ci 19140 (Yellow 5), Ci 14700 (Red 4), Ci 42090 (Blue 1).",
    "how_to_use": "Suggested Usage:.-Fragrance is intensified by the warmth of your own body. Apply in the creases of your knees and elbows for a longer-lasting, stronger scent.&nbsp;.-After applying, avoid rubbing or dabbing skin. This breaks down the fragrance, causing it to wear off more quickly.&nbsp;.-If you prefer placing fragrance on your wrists, be sure to reapply after frequent hand-washing, as this tends to rinse off the scent.&nbsp;.-Replace fragrance after 12 months. Expired perfumes more than a year old lose the integrity of the original scent... Eau de Toilette or Eau de Parfum?: .The difference lies in the volume of perfume oil. While EDT contains five to nine percent, EDP contains more, usually eight to 14 percent. EDPs, therefore, last longer and smell more intense.",

I find it to be quite light and airy, not too heavy or dense. It has longevity and lasts throughout the day, I like to apply it to my neck and my wrists, and I am able to smell it throughout the whole day. It does slightly dissipate after the hours go on, but I can still smell this by dinner time when I put it on at 6:00. A.m.! The packaging is a little odd, but that's not something that bothers me. I do really like the combination of the gold and the black. Overall, I would recommend this perfume to someone else and will continue to use it to completion."

I find it intense woody chypre with a hint of jasmine, incense, and slight musk. Itu2019s described as a warm floral however I find it more to be a warm vanilla. Genuinely the mango leaves a warm yet kind of sweet scent to the skin whilst not overpowering the jasmine. I find because of the incense it is a long lasting perfume and even though it is a bit pricy, it is definitely worth the money as you donu2019t need a lot for it to last ! I sprayed one tester spray to wear on my wrist to test longevity and it was very solid until hour 8. The scent was very much still present but more on the lighter side at around 10h of wear. Also, the packaging is so cute and chic."

The iconic design of the bottle is truly captivating with its robot shape that perfectly captures Pacco Rabannes futuristic style. The scent not smells exquisite on the skin but also looks fantastic on a vanity table. It is a versatile fragrance that lasts all day and is perfect for those who appreciate a blend of warm floral and fruity notes.

I love that the bottle does not have a cap (so no losing it!), the spray button is located conveniently on the top of the bottle and really easy to use. It sprays the perfect amount every time. I personally like a few sprays so you can use to your desired taste.   I really enjoyed the musky jasmine scent and for me, the smell is not too strong u2013 just enough where it lingers and keeps you smelling good all day. I had lots of compliments and scent stayed on pretty much throughout the day.   Personally, I would pay good money for a perfume I really enjoy and I would definitely purchase this again!

I had a coworker tell me how great my perfume was  near the end of my shift. This was numerous hours after application and since I had quit smelling it myself.

I tend to like scents that are a little more florally or sweet in nature, however, this fragrance has grown on me. It smells very tropical in the beginning, in a neither masculine or feminine way- very neutral. It does dry down to be more vanilla later on. I love the base scent although I donu2019t particularly love the initial scent. It dries down to a sensual, and warm scent that is elegant and pleasant.

It's a standout choice for anyone looking for a memorable and versatile scent.  Hoping to try Fame Intense next but I would highly recommend you to add this captivating fragrance to your collection."

Upon the first spray, I was pleasantly surprised. This is 100% a perfume I would wear out on a date night. The first notes I noticed were soft and sweet, and once it settled, I noted a slight u2018masculineu2019 cologne undertone.  And the final note that is quite noticeable on my skin is the jasmine.  Overall, this is a perfume I could see being appealing to most people looking for a signature date night scent. The scent is lasting fairly well so far, and only gets better as it settles!"

Paco Rabanne's fragrance bottle is a testament to the brand's attention to detail and commitment to quality, with its sleek, modern design reflecting the essence of the fragrance within. The presentation is a work of art in itself, showcasing the brand's dedication to craftsmanship and excellence."

It is a very soft, delicate scent - mostly Jasmine with a hint of musk,  and not the least bit overbearing as one might assume from a scent called Fame.  As the day goes on, I noticed that it almost has a vanilla note to it.   It is very understated in the best way, and it makes me smile when I smell it - both from the familiarity of and the loveliness of the scent.

That said, it is a unique scent, in a positive way. On my skin, I felt it didnu2019t stay a really long time with just a couple of sprays, but when I sprayed it on my clothing, I did smell it days later when I picked the clothing item up again. Itu2019s absolutely beautiful though and I would highly recommend. I will be purchasing in the future with my own money."

Fame Parfum is not a scent I would typically gravitate toward, and it is not particularly unique, but Iu2019m quite surprised at this fragrance. I mostly get florals through the jasmine note, and then some tropical fruitiness from mango, but there is something dark about itu2014thanks to the incense, patchouli, and pink pepper. This fragrance is probably best enjoyed on cooler summer nights, when the tropical aspect is appropriate but the temperature doesnu2019t make the depth of the scent too overwhelming. I will enjoy this sample but probably will not buy a larger bottle for myself."

A little goes a long way. One spray and I literally didn't need one more or I would have been overpowered with too much. So definitely lasts and is very strong to where you don't need much at all! The first notes I took in were the jasmine floral and hint of incense but my fave is that subtle musk finish. It's such an amazing scent. I definitely will need to purchase a bottle now because I'm actually in love with this. I love finding new fragrances that I wouldn't have ever tried before as it's not like any others I have. But I really am loving this scent!"

The scent is unique and captivating, and it lasts all day without being overwhelming.  The first thing that caught my attention was the packaging. The bottle is sleek and elegant, with a touch of edginess with its black and gold design. It definitely stands out on my vanity and adds a touch of luxury to my collection.  The scent itself is a perfect blend of sweet and spicy notes. The top notes of mandarin and pink pepper give it a refreshing and fruity kick, while the heart notes of vanilla and coffee add a warm and sensual touch. The base notes of patchouli and cedarwood give it a woody and earthy undertone, making it a well-rounded and complex fragrance.  What I love most about this perfume is its longevity. I only need a few sprays in the morning and it lasts throughout the day. I have received numerous compliments while wearing it, with people asking what scent I am wearing.  The only downside to this perfume is that it may be too strong for some people. It is a powerful and bold scent, so I would recommend spraying it lightly to avoid it from being overwhelming.  Overall, I highly recommend the Paco Rabanne Fame Parfum for anyone looking for a unique and long-lasting scent. It is perfect for both day and night wear, and it will definitely make you stand out in a crowd. I will definitely be purchasing this fragrance in the future."

When I initially sprayed it, the scent was very strong, but became a musky, woody scent fairly quickly.

It's like a tropical blast that screams, Let's get this fiesta started! Seriously, it's the kinda entrance you want at every shindig.  Jasmine and Olibanum. Now, I ain't a flower expert, but these two are like the Beyoncu00e9 and Jay-Z of the perfume world. Jasmine brings the floral drama, while Olibanum adds this creamy, smoky thing that's lowkey addictive. Can't lie, I'm here for it. As the night goes on, Fame wraps you in Sandalwood and Vanilla. It's like a warm, sweet hug that lingers. You know when you walk past and someone's like, Dang, who smells amazing? Yeah, that's the Fame effect.  And the bottle? So Pretty!

The opening itu2019s creamy mango and bergamot in the dry down I can smell vanilla and kind of coconut even though itu2019s not listed in the notes. Itu2019s a lovely summery feel good scent. It lasts 6+ hours on my skin. The silage itu2019s moderate which is good. I really like this smell and will repurchase after finishing this bottle."

A good six hours in, it was still pretty good but did mellow out in the lasting hours to a more lighter vanilla and floral scent which was very nice. The fragrance provides a femininity that I like, which also the brand advertises. It also gives off sensual vibes. I felt confident knowing I smelled good. My friend complimented me too.  I canu2019t forget about the design of the bottle! It looks elegant on my dresser. The chain mail dress design is so unique. I would recommend this as a Christmas gift for sure. Perfect for the Winter season as this perfume suits well with the cold seasons."

I like it that you can wear it for both day and night time due to itu2019s musky and mangoe tone, Itu2019s my new addition to the vanity but I think itu2019s little pricy , we could get similar kind of fragrance in little lower price , but over all Iu2019m happy with it"

It is also extremely good for long term wear lasting for an entire day and night out with friends, and that was just 2 sprays, one on each wrist, I can definitely understand the price point as will easily last months as long as you aren't over doing it at each use."

The bottle looks great on my vanity and you'd never know it's perfume! The scent is very tropical and floral with a touch of intrigue and drama. It's very lightweight and warm which makes it perfect for everyday wear. But it doesn't last that long. However, if you're looking for full on drama, intrigue and sensuality I recommend Lady Million Royal. Both perfumes have become go to in my daily life, one for the daytime/work/ and the other for events or when I want to feel mysterious.  I loved the Fame scent and this makes the perfect everyday perfume plus again the bottle is just so so cute! The scent may not be long-lasting but the memory of it sure will be.

In my opinion, Paco Rabanne parfums usually last all day, and this one definitely lives up to that standard. Plus the packaging is super cute and unique. It fits perfect in my collection!"

Overall better than average staying power compared to others Iu2019ve tried, which Iu2019m very happy about.   I found myself reaching for it more often for special events, work, and even school! I will say it is quite pricey, but 3-5 sprays and youu2019re set for the entire day!  9/10, I seriously recommend this if you can afford it and want a perfume that is good for literally any occasion and will last all day"

I like that I can smell warm and cozy without it being too overwhelming. Itu2019s still a mature scent, so thatu2019s a huge bonus because i find that sometimes warm scents tend to be too overpowering. The fragrance itself also lasts a long time, Iu2019ve worn it to work and just while running errands and it seems so stick. Another plus is the packaging - I love fragrances that have great packaging because i display them on my dresser and this looks great alongside my other perfumes.

It lasts well throughout the day (I can still smell it on my wrists at the end of the day) and transforms to be more woody as time goes on. Itu2019s not my favourite for winter, but I will absolutely bring it out for a fresh summer scent.

First, the bottle: designed after one of Paco Rabanne's designs, this bottle calls back the fun and beauty in perfume bottles as collector pieces. The scent itself is perfect for late fall/early winter as the jasmine and musk notes intermingle with the mango notes. In terms of longevity I found it did last about four hours. What I like is that this is the type of perfume where if it mixes well with your body chemistry you don't need too much and the notes linger all day (even after the majority dissipates after 4 hours). I would totally recommend this as a gift for the perfume lover who likes daring-yet-whimsical fruity/musk matchups in a perfume."

The top notes of mango, pink pepper, and bergamot give it a fresh and slightly spicy opening, while the heart notes of patchouli, jasmine, and frankincense add a warm and exotic touch. The scent is a creamy and slightly sweet finish. The longevity of the perfume is impressive, lasting all day. The sillage is moderate, making it perfect for both daytime and evening wear. The black bottle is sleek and elegant, adding to the overall experience. I would definitely recommend this perfume to anyone looking for a unique and long-lasting scent. And plus the package is so pretty and futuristic girl bottle!"

After testing this perfume out for the last week or so, I found that the main talking point was its longevity. After an 8 hour work shift, I still had people asking me what perfume I was wearing! I was absolutely shocked.   With the main notes being mango, jasmine and incense, I found that this combination was absolutely wonderful. After all, I am a sucker for jasmine scents. Considering I'm trying to write this review from an unbiased standpoint I will give it an original 5 stars. However, when comparing this perfume to the others in the Paco Rabanne collection, I'll have to say that Lady Million Fabulous has to be the winner in comparison to fame by smell alone. Given it's longevity, it's new and improved packaging (I absolutely love the little robot, I think it's adorable) when compared to other Paco Rabanne perfumes (the pointy diamond shape was a tad awkward) I do have to give this perfume a solid five stars. I simply have no complaints about it, and will be keeping this in my growing collection of Paco Rabanne perfumes! Thank you to influenster for the product, I aim to give honest reviews no matter what!"

If youu2019re also a fan of sweeter fragrances, Iu2019m sure you will love this. In my opinion, I would say this is the perfect perfume to wear for a night out. Itu2019s very intoxicating- in a good way."

I know a lot of people think paco rabanne packaging is tacky, and I agree for some, but I find the fame bottle adorable. I will say that generally my experience with paco rabanne atomizers has not been the greatest (anything less than a full spray will come out as a stream of liquid). Onto the perfume, fame opens with a very strong mango top note. Itu2019s not a fresh mango, but reminds me more of mango candy. Personally, I find the opening a bit cloying but luckily it fades quite quickly on the skin after a few minutes. The mango does stick around for a while on clothes though. Once the top notes fade, the perfume settles into a sweet, creamy floral and pretty much stays that way except I find it gets more powdery with wear. Nothing special about the dry down, I find it a very generic inoffensive floral. Sillage is moderate, and longevity is also nothing remarkable although the scent lasts much longer on clothes. I could see this being someoneu2019s everyday perfume, although it might lean a bit heavy in warmer weather. Personally, itu2019s not exactly my cup of tea but I can see why people would enjoy this."

On first spray it smelled kinda spicy, warm, musky on me. I was hoping for the mango or sweet notes to come out on my skin but, they never did. After it dried down it was a lot nicer, soft and more powdery but still a hint of musk. My mom tried and more sweet notes came out on her. Neither of us were fans of this perfume, it was just too musky and powdery where I prefer more floral/fruit scents. This does seem like a more u201cmatureu201d scent. This fragrance is long lasting but does dry down more light. Iu2019m sure on others this would smell lovely, but unfortunately warm, musk, powder scents smell horrible with my skin chemistry. I was happy to try this though, thank you Influenster & Paco Rabanne for the opportunity!"

As it settles, there's this lovely floral vibe that's both girly and fierce.   What's unique is that I'm not a fan of florals u2013 most of my perfumes are vanilla and woody. But this one stands out and is perfect for those of us who usually steer clear of florals. It's not overbearing and the perfect middle.   THE LONGEVITY!!!!!  Very few scents manage to stick around on me, and it's always a struggle. However, Fame is one of the rare few that has lasted all day without needing a reapplication.  I feel it will stick around in my collection for 7 years like their Olympia. Paco Rabanne Fame has officially overtaken the competition and is my everyday for the season!"

I am extremely pick when it comes to fragrance and was worried this was going to be a miss - I was (mostly) wrong. I love sweet scents and when you first spray this, it gives a very sweet, vanilla-leaning woodier floral smell. However, after it blends into my body chemistry after some time, I find I pick up significantly more on the floral notes and the perfume becomes a scent profile I would typically shy away from. I would not recommend this for someone who wants to emphasize the woodier, muskier scent profiles. This is very much so for the ones who appreciate the more conventional floral scents with a little twist. Overall, though, I would continue to wear this. I find it a great choice for both an occasion as it feels classic, elegant, and elevated with the florals as well as a more casual evening because it can be cut with the sweeter notes - It feels feminine and fun for a girlsu2019 night on the town.   I find the bottle is a little gimmicky, but itu2019s a very cute and unique piece to have out on your vanity or in your bathroom because itu2019s so elaborate in design. It would be a cute gift for someone who appreciates unique bottle designs. The bottle sprays well despite this design and Iu2019m happy it isnu2019t a nuisance or impractical. It has a sturdy design and I am not afraid it will topple over accidentally."

It finds itself in a great balance between sweetness and edge. The bottle is very fun and spraying it is easy. I enjoy the black sequin element. This is a very versatile and inoffensive fragrance, so you can wear is any occasion you see fit. Personally, due to the deeper element of the Parfum, it will be a nighttime scent for me! Just because itu2019s fruity doesnu2019t limit it to being just a summer fragrance. While the EDP is a 3.5-4 star in my books, this one comes to a 5/5."

I own a lot of perfumes and am familiar with all different notes and genres of fragrance, I will say this is not my taste but objectively I can appreciate this scent and can see how a lot of people would like it.   True to the original FAME EDP, mango is the prominent note in this fragrance. The other note that sticks out to me is the jasmine, it adds a sharpness to the scent, which I think is what I donu2019t like for me personally, since Iu2019m pretty picky with my florals. This is in the same category as Mugler Alien Goddess, it has the same u00ab sunscreen u00bb type vibe, I almost detect some coconut in here even though itu2019s not listed as a note.  These types of scents are perfect for summer, especially hot climates by the beach! It is unfortunately winter here in Canada but I think perhaps Iu2019ll enjoy it more in the summer months. The best part about this fragrance is its longevity, I only sprayed twice and 12 hours later I can very much still smell it. A lot of these tropical scents are light and fade easily, this one is perfect if you like the original FAME but want something louder, that projects and lasts longer!  Full honesty, I genuinely think most people would like FAME Parfum though, as long as youu2019re into florals. Itu2019s a safe, mass-appealing scent, not the most unique but an easy grab nonetheless.   Received product from Influenster in exchange for my honest review. This does not affect my honesty, I try being as objective as possible in my reviews."

I would call this a cozy tropical scent perfect for winter season, itu2019s not overpowering but has amazing projection. I sprayed this on around 3pm and could still smell it at midnight.

Well Iu2019ll try my best to explain but itu2019s such a seductive smell without being over the top. You have the slight notes of floral but not too much! Meanwhile you get that woody musk coming in. Itu2019s so nice, Iu2019m 25 and I feel like itu2019s my new signature scent. I feel like this parfumu00e9 will compliment anyone of any age since itu2019s not too overpowering.

The product's scent lasts for days, and a tiny amount of the product is enough to enjoy its sweet floral fragrance. I always get a complaint whenever I wear this scent, so I would definitely recommend buying this product. Plus, the perfume bottle is unique, adorable, and stands out on my dressing table."

I also think the bottle looks very cute on display. It's also worth noting that the scent lasts all day on my skin and clothing which is so important when selecting a perfume. Would probably repurchase this product once it's done or try other scents from the brand. Very happy with it!"

I love the way this perfume has a floral-musky scent and itu2019s not a strong scent at all. If I want to describe the scent in more details Iu2019d say itu2019s a feminine, mild, fresh, and sweet floral-musky scent with a distinct jasmine note. I sprayed it on my shirt at noon and around 7 hours later, I can still smell it on my shirt so the longevity is good as well. The bottle design is so creative and unique which also make it a great gift. I specially love those sunglasses, itu2019s just so cute."

The smell is not overwhelmingly sweet or floral, but you still get those notes each sniff. Iu2019m not a huge fan of floral or sweet scents, but this is coupled with woodsy/vanilla notes that balance it out nicely. Itu2019s nothing mind blowing, or showstopping (although the bottle is amazing!) but I definitely would recommend"
