I think it might be causing some minor breakouts for this reason, but I am going to keep using it to be sure. Overall I definitely don't regret giving it a shot and I'm going to keep trying it out. Also this shade light is darker in person-it's slightly too dark for me but since it's summer I can work with it."

My only issue is the fair color is still a little to dark for me, really wish there was an ultra-fair or maybe just porcelain with neutral undertones and not warm.  Compact lasts quite a while too. Have repurchased a few times and will continue too."

It’s a pretty good “summer color” for me, but definitely not “fair”.  The bad: the packaging. Putting this powder in compact form was apparently a bad plan. It arrived already covered in fingerprints & with the powder crumbling. I tapped my flat foundation brush on it, and shattered the powder so much I ended up pulverizing the rest to try and use as loose powder. Doesn’t work very well.   If this was sold as loose powder and came in more shades, it would be great! Otherwise….probably not a rebuy for me."

I love how light it is on my skin, and how well it plays with other powders (blush, finishing powder, bronzer) AND liquid concealer! The powder isn’t overly-mattifying, so it allows skin to looks like skin and to develop a nice glow as the day goes on (I have combo skin)—meaning it will also work well for many with either oily or dry skin types (though don’t look to this to control oil!). It has reasonable lasting power on my skin, and looks nicer as the day goes on. Furthermore, the applicator it comes with works very well, and you can easily customize whether you want fuller or lighter coverage. Unlike other (viral) compact powder foundations, this one doesn’t fly everywhere when you dip your brush in, nor does it start chalking up when you apply pressure with the applicator. It’s long-lasting, applies quickly and efficiently, and looks great. Bravo to Wander Beauty for this formulation!"

I have been struggling to find   a foundation that isn’t cake batter, isn’t high maintenance, isn’t scaly, and doesn’t sit in my fine lines and make me look ancient, and I’ve spent a TON of money trying a billion kinds in my search. I was wary about a powder bc I’d left loose powder behind when my skin started aging and realized it made me look worse, and powder tends to cling to my dry parts and highlight them. This stuff does an amazing job of evening out my skin tone and still looking like skin - I actually prefer my skin with this on. One star docked bc it isn’t a true holy grail. I’ve found that it works better without primer (I’ve never actually found a primer I truly liked though, tbh), after a few hours it does start to find my fine lines, and if I’m not properly moisturized or am having a skin issue, it will cling a little bit to the dry parts. But there are definitely foundations out there (and really expensive ones, too!) that accentuate lines and dry parts way worse, and make my pores look like craters or slide all over the place. This doesn’t. It stays put and looks fresh for a long time. Definitely has become my daily wear foundation."

Disappointing because I was trying to avoid talc based powder foundations but not at the expense of my makeup looking like this! It was gross by the end of the day! Also went on unevenly and clung weirdly to a dry patch I had on one area of my cheek so I imagine it might not work well with dry skin either.

			"review_text": "I am on the fence with this product; first of all I do think the color matches me pretty well, I thought it looked quite dark in the package but after swiping the sponge I can see that the color is lighter than it looks. It does appear to be on the more orange side of warm, I am a fair olive complexion that has more green tones to my skin so the warmth of this kind of put me off at first however so far I am not noticing that much of a color difference or warming effect which is good.  At first I see that it mattifies pretty well though I am unsure if this is the result of the powder itself or the sponge as sponges do have the tendency to blot and absorb oil. However I find that after barely a few hrs of wear I am full on shiny again which I find rather frustrating.    I do not get great coverage with this, I wasn't looking for Full coverage but enough to at least even out the skin which I didn't really experience with this. I see that as a foundation it really does not do enough in my opinion to be used on its own, so I mainly use this as a setting powder. But as I have mentioned after a short time I am an oil slick so this isn't really the bet setting powder for me.  The container is quite large which makes it rather awkward to carry around and fit into my makeup bag as it takes up a ton of room.   The price for this is on the expensive side and considering I can't really use this as a foundation as the product claims it can be used I think this is just too expensive for a simple pressed powder that doesn't really have any impressive qualities.  I will likely use it when I can but I will not be repurchasing once it's done as there are far better pressed powder foundations on the market in my opinion."

			"review_text": "I cannot say enough good things about this foundation!  It has completely revolutionized my makeup routine! It's like foundation, concealer, and setting powder all in one.  If you apply it correctly, it's full coverage, doesn't cake, goes on smoothly, and stays for most of the day, usually with one quick touch-up.  It can be used with other products but when I'm in a hurry I use only this foundation, mascara, lip balm, and maybe some blush.  Done in five minutes with awesome coverage.     1) There is a protective plastic film over the mirror.  You have to take the film off. 2) If you use the applicator it comes with, it will be the most full coverage powder you've ever tried!  It does look different for the first few minutes before it settles into your skin, but give it a minute or two and watch it all meld together to create this ethereal veil of soft, smooth, seamless coverage.  (It will look lighter in color and a bit cakey at first.  Seriously, give it 2 minutes to set itself and it will look like perfection.) 3) That applicator is magic.  (Don't throw it out when you're done with the compact.  Wash it just like a brush and use it for other powders. It's awesome.) 4) If you use a brush it still looks good, but it will be medium coverage instead of full. 5). If you concentrate it on a problem area, like redness or a zit, it will act like a concealer. 6) It does not flash back at all.  Seriously.  I wore this for my wedding a few months ago and all the photos all look good, the professional ones and the ones guests took on their phones.   7) I use Shade 1 as foundation and then brush on Shade 2 anywhere the sun would normally hit.  It's a perfect non-harsh bronzer for fair skin. 8).  The longer you wear it, the more it hydrates. It might be a bit tight for the first 2-3 minutes, but once it sets  It'll start hydrating and sitting comfortably.   It would be great if there were more shades and if Wander could add some spf.  That would make it pretty much perfect!"

I was hesitant about the powder, but I’ve been super impressed with Wander products from my Ipsy bag so I gave it a try. I LOVE it. It provides really good coverage without a thick or powdery feeling. Works well with the included powder pad or with my foundation brush. Definitely going to continue to buy this. My new video meeting makeup routine, including this and the On-the-Glow blush and highlighter stick, takes about 5 minutes. WIN!"

It requires minimal touch ups and even as it wears off, it looks natural and not patchy. It is also super easy to carry for touch ups and ok the go, the applicator works well as does a powder foundation brush. I also love the packaging, a very low mess powder foundation. I give 4 stars for the color selection. This shade is slightly too warm/orange but it is the neutral shades are too pale. I think the shade range is too limited to suit many different skin tones. Overall, I enjoyed it, it is not a powder that you have to “work into” your skin, just slap it on with minimal effort and it looks so beautiful on the skin, even if you have textured skin or larger pores. I often get compliments."

Come on now.  Anyways, I’m not a fan of this powder. I would not say this is full coverage or buildable. It’s sheer. When I first opened this product the color looked way too light to be “tan” but I tried it anyway and it did end up oxidizing so the color did turn more tan-ish. It feels wonderful going on the skin but I just need more coverage and I thought I would be getting great coverage by the claims this product has but sadly I did not."

I’m on my second compact which is very rare I repurchase something like this as I live to try new products so that is a good testament to it. I like the application sponge and it’s held up over many washes.  My first one a while back did break in my purse but new one is fine. I tend to be dry skinned but oily nose etc and big pores for reference, always use moisturizer first and sometimes primer but not always and it looks fine without which is important because I don’t have time for extra steps every day."

I use it usually with Fenty's foundation and primer, and it turns out beautifully most if not all the time. I apply it with a powder brush.

			"review_text": "First off, the formula of this product is unlike any powder I’ve tried before. I heard from one of the founders that this product actually starts as a liquid and is dehydrated through a propriety process. As a result of the dehydration process, the powder is very silky and creamy and has a beautiful slip to it, even though it’s a powder. I initially bought it in the shade medium due to it’s description and I checked with Wander customer service just to make sure this is indeed my shade. I received the product in the mail and tried it on and I was so impressed with the formula and the beautiful coverage and staying power it as. I set the powder with MAC’s fix plus and it’s definitely a winning combination! Flawless, poreless, silky coverage BUT I had a problem. The description of the color was really off. It says that it’s made for medium skin tones with warm subtle olive undertones and I don’t think that’s accurate. For reference, I’m NC35 in MAC, 3W1 in Estée Lauder, 290 in Fenty foundation. All of those shades definitely have olive/yellow in them, but this, in my opinion, does not. It appears really more of a pinkish undertone against my yellow/olive skin. I returned the product because despite its amazing formula, you can see it on my skin because the shade wasn’t accurate at all. It’s pinkish undertone really stood out and after the foundation was on and melted into the skin, albeit beautifully, the undertone is clearly not warm or subtle olive at all. I’m afraid that their next two colors aren’t going to match me and don’t want to be wasteful and order them, just to then return it. Please, please, please, Wander Beauty, double check your color descriptions And expand the line of colors. Fenty set the standard to 42 colors and I believe that’s not only trend-setting but thoughtful and inclusive. This is absolutely a WINNING formula, but the lack of shades is disappointing."

The fair was perfect for my skin tone (i use cream puff in Too Faced concealer for comparison) and goes on so smooth with just the right coverage.

It doesn't look pretty and smooth anymore, but mine crumbled months ago and I just keep pressing it back into solid form. I do wish they could keep it from cracking, but I think in order to do so they would have to reformulate it, and then it would lose some of its super-soft, moisturizing magic. This is really not normal powder foundation, it is really silky, non-drying, and covers my big pores and redness. Truly the best coverage I've found in a powder foundation."

I see there are some reviews that are negative about the packaging of the product. I use the sponge that came with the foundation to apply it and am careful to try to use the edge of the foundation so it will have a consistent thickness after I use more of it.

It’d be 5 stars if it wasn’t for seeing other reviews about the powder’s lack of stability when traveling (and also limited colors, but looks like they have more color options now!), but I haven’t had a chance to test it out yet and don’t want to risk it until I have to ha. Will be traveling to Asia soon, so we’ll see. But otherwise this powder is so good. Originally was looking for a replacement for the Bareminerals blemish powder that was discontinued that I’d been using and loved. So far had been just using it as a setting powder because I was concerned about color match, but the other day tried it by itself to save on time and wear less makeup. It works amazing by itself!! Used the puff thing that comes with the compact, and it works so well - builds up to medium-full coverage in only a couple swipes and few concentrated areas I needed extra coverage, not cakey at all. It’s matte, but not a flat matte, it kind of glows? Stayed put all day with just my Tatcha silk sunscreen+silk primer underneath, hardly any oil came through. Excited to see how it’ll do in Houston heat. The puff seemed similar in feel to Korean cushion compacts, then I checked the box and found this is made in Korea! No wonder it’s so good. Even better now that more shades came out, as I’ll need something darker when summer comes around. Was gonna try color medium next, but will go for light medium in case medium is too dark. Love this foundation so much. Wish it was cheaper or more product (at least 1 more gram?) for the price. Will repurchase!"

I normally throw those applicator sponges away but this one is actually really effective and not at all harsh on my sensitive skin. I have combination skin and it seems to really meld with my skin and looks more and more natural as the day goes on, it doesn’t seem to cake up at all. It does settle into a couple of the deeper lines around my eyes but every foundation does that for me, unfortunately. The main reason that I’m giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the color options - right now I’m using FAIR and it’s perfect for Summer, but I guarantee in two months when Fall/Winter roll around this shade will be too dark for me. This badly needs color options at both ends of the spectrum, these shades all seem to be geared towards light to light-medium skin tones."

Sadly, you cannot travel with this compact and after 3 weeks, it crumbled to pieces and I was only about 1/3 way through. For a product that costs $40, it should never fall apart so quickly. If you just leave it at home and never move it or put it in your bag, you should be ok. But, if you want to take it with you for touchups, don't expect it to last long. I kept it in the box it came in all the time and that still didn't help. I read previous reviews that this has happened to other users but was hoping if I was careful, I could avoid it. Not the case. Very disappointing because the product works so well, but it's like throwing money down the drain since you don't get a chance to use the entire product."

My skin has never looked better and it doesn't break me out. It's so easy to apply and lasts pretty long, with minor touch ups here and there. If you have large pores, just make sure to use a primer first, or your pores might show a little. With all of that being said, this is my favorite formula that I have ever tried for a power foundation.  For the bad.....it cracks! The first one I bought cracked after a week. I am not violent with my purse, nor did I drop it or slam it, yet it broke. I bought another one and didn't put it on my makeup bag and it only lasted 2 weeks before it shattered. This stuff cracks way too easily for 40$! Hence only the 4 stars. If they could get this formula to not crack, it would literally be the best powder foundation on earth."

Nice coverage and you can use a small brush to really concentrate it on the blemishes (works esp well over a primer or moisturizer for hiding blemishes). I went with 4 stars because on it's own it gets a slight sheen to it within about an hour of application that I personally don't care for and it settles slightly into my fines lines. With that being said, I found that if I apply a matte/oil absorbing finishing powder to my skin first and apply this on top, it seems to take care of the issue and I get a nice silky finish that lasts most of the day. I know that sounds backwards but it's what's worked for my 40  yr old aging skin. I'd also say 4 stars because of the price. $40 is a lot. With that being said, in terms of not having to use a liquid foundation to get the look I want, it's the best product I've found. So, I'll continue to shell out the $$$."

			"review_text": "I owned this compact for less than a month before it started to fall apart. The powder was nothing special and looked really cakey if my skin was a bit the dry side so I couldn’t use it without adding a moisturizer or primer first so it saved me no time or money by cutting down on other products. I was never able to achieve much coverage with this product so I use it more as a setting powder with other concealers and foundations. I really wanted to love this product from all the hype and rave reviews and the colour happened to be a good match but it just didn’t hold up on the go at all.   I kept it in my purse for touch ups but every time I opened the compact, the powder would lift away from the pan more and more each time. I had to pack the powder back down with the sponge whenever I used it until the whole thing eventually cracked, broke into a bunch of bits and fell out completely with more than 75% of the product still left unused. I had never dropped this compact even once while I’ve owned it and have no idea why the powder kept lifting and cracking. I have owned compacts from the drug store that have never fallen aspart this badly as this one even after dropping them repeatedly while being half used up.   This product was a waste of time and not definitely worth the price. The lady at Sephora wouldn’t even let me take it back or switch out for anything else because it broke completely just outside of the 30 day return period and now it collects dust in my bathroom.   Also, I have to mention not to leave this compact in direct sunlight. I left in the car once this summer and when I opened it, there was a mysterious sticky residue pooling under the clear lid. I tried to clean it up as best I could but even after using various make up cleaning solutions, I couldn’t take it off completely. I eventually realized the glue on it the inner compartment had MELTED. To this day, I still can’t manage to scrap I off the residue and it keeps caking up with powder."

I use a brush to apply simply by pressing the brush onto the compact and then applying to my face. I thought the cracks would be OK however after a month and a half my project began to crumble.  A couple of weeks later I open the compact and it had disintegrated into chunks and powder. I hadn't even used a third of the compact. This is the second foundation I've had, the other was in the color medium. I had no problem with the medium shade and used it up. This one I will need to throw away after only using about a quarter of the product. I don't know what the problem is, but I'm hesitant to purchase it again.  This product is too expensive if  I can't use all the product.  In case you're wondering, I never dropped the case and stored it very carefully."

This is the first powder foundation that minimized the redness without looking super powdery or cakey. I can see my dry patches (I'm up close and looking for them) but not to the point where I think someone a reasonable talking distance away will notice. I needed something that would even my skintone quickly for those days where I don't want to put the effort into liquid foundation. This was totally worth the wait. The fair is a touch yellow for me but it can be blended easily. I do agree with a previous review that it would likely make a mess inside your purse.

Studio Fix has been my go-to for ages, but lately it seems to be caking and I'm having a hard time matching a color. Wanderlust Powder Foundation is great! It provides excellent coverage that is buildable without looking cakey. It wore all day on me (I touched up the t-zone throughout the day) and it did not oxidize at all. I love it! I purchased the shade Medium, which was a bit lighter than I anticipated, but still worked well for me as my spray tan faded. I liked that it was a very neutral undertone. I definitely plan on purchasing Tan for when I have a fresh spray tan and probably even Light for when I don't have a spray tan. This is the only product I have tried thus far from Wander Beauty and I am definitely intrigued...and impressed!!!"

I apply with a dense Kabuki brush (patting motion over areas that need extra coverage, i.e- acne areas). It does not clog my pores and cause breakouts like typical full-coverage powders do. 3rd it does not cake and lasts quite a long time on my oily skin. When it's time for me to re-powder, the new layer of powder layers beautifully over the first.  It's very finely milled and has kick up, very similar to pigmented eye shadows. You DO NOT have to press down hard to get product from the pan, literally tap your brush or sponge into it. Saying that, it can break easily. Wander was super smart with its packaging, they included an inner plastic protection door. When you open the compact, the sponge is on top (separated from the powder) and the plastic door protects and loose powder from spilling out of the compact. Genius.  literally the only downfall is the lack of shades and I hope they release more soon.  For those shopping- fair and medium are more neutral, where as light is very warm. I use fair in the winter and medium in the summer."

It lasts all day. I even wore it while I was outside gardening in 100+ degree heat. My makeup wasn't perfect when I came inside, but I still looked better than I thought I would.

Almost every day I wear minimal make-up (SPF, mascara, brows, concealer, lipstick, perfume) and I'm out the door.   I use the Yves Saint Laurent - Fusion Ink cushion foundation shade B30. But it is semi-dewy and I wanted to matte it down.   This foundation (Light) is beautiful! I have light skin with yellow/beige undertones. The Light shade is somewhat dark with strong, overpowering yellow undertones if you want full coverage. I apply a light layer instead. The YSL cushion is a knock-out product but the Wanderlust has been a gorgeous setting powder. I use it to set and even when I wear it on its own, both have amazing results. Love the ingredients, a month in and no breakouts.  Absolutely silky, lightweight, blurring, and perfecting! The only other powder I love is the Hourglass ambient lighting powder (Diffused Light).  I'm very picky. I have normal skin but once I find a holy grain product I stick with it. My skin is usually good, hydrated, and pretty flawless except during hormonal breakouts. For me this has been fantastic. Quick, easy touch-ups, no breakouts, and makes my face look air-brushed. Definitely long-wearing too. I get 10 hours before I notice some cakiness, but only up close on a magnified mirror. I do think they need to come out with more shades though. I wasn't expecting a lot but color me impressed. The Light has been phenomenal on my face and definitely keep oil at bay during hormonal breakouts and provides sebum control. I had a few acne on my chin, used Tea Tree oil overnight and it has been healing without getting worse under the powder. If it helps to know, I also don't use primers unless SPF counts since my skin is usually hydrated from my night routine (double cleanse, toner, essence, ampoule, serum, moisturizer)."

I'm suffering with severe hormonal acne breakouts that includes blackheads, and the deep inflamed painful bumps that take weeks to heal - this is the best powder foundation that I've found. easy to build coverage, remains natural looking as it sets, provides good coverage for dark spots too, although I always color correct and conceal them before powder. anyways, take a chance on this powder and be pleasantly surprised. it is gentle on my sensitive skin."

All it takes is a few swipes and my face looks incredibly flawless. I never thought my skintone looked necessarily better with a foundation over it, but with this powder, the difference is dramatic. It is highly pigmented but light feeling, and lasts all day. Super impressed and I will continue to use this product!"

It's so light feeling that I forget I'm wearing any at all. I haven't used a brush because I like to go on the lighter side but that's really all you need. This is the most I've ever spent on foundation and I am so happy I did."

I have a lot of redness to cover and this does the job quite well. I also have oily skin and this has a nice matte finish, again without the chalk effect I get from other powders. It's the first one I've used that still looked well under office flourescent lights. Love this stuff!"

It's not chalky, it's just a soft buildable matte that covers my flaws, dark spots, and acne scars. It's highly pigmented and just looks like my skin but better. So very pleased! I pray this is never discontinued as I've finally found my holy grail!"

I love to use these for myself and for my clients, it is good to use for that everyday girl that wants a natural look or you can apply more layers for a full face look. A plus the packaging- it has its own compartment for the sponge-genius! Lastly the ingredients- read all the good benefits it has for you skin and you'll want to buy one for yourself!"

			"review_text": "I have never liked a powder foundation enough to buy it - they crease, look cakey, and are either too heavy or do nothing at all. But I was really impressed by this powder -it is super-fine, silky, very pigmented, and doesn't look cakey at all. I have used it every day for the past week, indoors and outdoors, and don't miss my regular liquid foundation at all (used to use Shu Uemura, Benefit, and Charlotte Tilbury)! It takes only a minute to apply full coverage; I find that patting it on my skin and then swiping lightly to blend, does the job well. I like using the puff it comes with, I don't think I would get the same result with a brush but haven't tried that yet. I have not had to reapply once, and it looks really natural (even when layered for full coverage). I haven't had any issues with pilling, as some other reviewers have - I suppose it depends what you wear underneath (I have tried it with regular moisturizer, with gel-like snail cream, and also with Charlotte Tilbury's Magic Cream underneath and have had no problem). The color is a perfect match on my skin. I usually never buy a foundation or concealer without trying it in person first, because of my skin tone, but I was remarkably surprised at how well this matched, based on the pictures.   TIP: I spray Caudalie's Beauty Elixir onto my skin after I apply my makeup and that really helps my skin look dewy, even with the powder foundation on."

I always need a powder on top to set it so it doesn't crease and crack. This covered my dark circles beautifully and lasted the entire day in this dreadful summer heat. I was impressed. I've been wearing it all over my face for the last few days it looks more natural that my usual liquid. The texture is super soft blends right into my skin."

			"review_text": "I was intrigued and wanted to try this product out since I just ran out of another from a different brand. I couldn't find any reviews for this anywhere online but decided to just take the plunge.   My skin is light but fair tones are usually too pale and pinkish, and end up making my face look pasty. So I ordered this in the light color. It's sort of muddy looking in person and a bit yellower than I'd hoped.  I've worn this a few times now. I've applied it with both the puff that's included and a powder brush. I don't think this product blends well at all. It just doesn't distribute evenly. The only way it works is if you want very very full coverage, then you can pack it on by using the included puff. But to me, it looks thick and unnatural that way, especially because the color needs to be blended out some.  I have also noticed that this product pills easily depending on what you've got underneath. With one moisturizer I use, it started pilling badly as soon as I applied it (this never happens when I use other powders or foundations after that moisturizer). I guess I needed to use some primer, but I don't always and would rather not have to every time I use this.   This product is supposed to be hydrating, but I find that claim pretty questionable... It seemed to settle into my fine lines and creases immediately and almost made my skin look drier and older. Then not long after that when I was outside for a little bit and sweating slightly, I wiped my eye area gently with my hand and the product was completely coming off on my hand.  Not a fan. Going to return this. There are much better products out there, especially at this price point."

			"review_text": "I got the lightest shade(pretty neutral with slightly more yellow tint) and it was good for my nc15/20 skintone. It's very powdery so when you use a brush, don't swirl it too much, dabbing works better. Pretty pigmented. In terms of coverage, it's pretty good at evening out the tone, but you will need concealer for blemishes. It seems to blur out pores well, and also very buildable.  In terms of lasting power, it lasted around an hour before it started oxidizing, and wearing off a little bit even with a setting powder. But I have very oily skin :p  In terms of packaging, it comes with a nice soft puff and a lid over powder, so it's pretty convenient. The lid looks a little weak but who cares, it has a lid!  Overall, it's a silky powder. I think it'd be more suitable for people with slightly-combo/normal/dry skin and wanting to cover pores and evening out skintone."
