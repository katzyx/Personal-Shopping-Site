This calmed everything down and made my face absolutely glow! It exceeded my expectations in every way and it would have been an absolute keeper even if my skin hadnu2019t been so irritable at the time. My skin has healed and I attribute that to this product and now Iu2019m able to use other creams without issue - but I still use this every night and canu2019t recommend it enough. If it works for your skin then youu2019re in for a real treat. It soaks in well and leaves no residue (heavy creams just sit on my face) and is very hydrating. The corresponding serum is excellent as well and isnu2019t harsh on the skin."

I got another stock up yesterday and immediately noticed thereu2019s no rose smell anymore and the formula seems different. Also the front of the package is not the same and omits u201cnight recoveryu201d on it. Hmmm very strange. Itu2019s not as rich as before but when I look up fresh lotus night recovery this is the product that comes up so itu2019s not a new product. Strange that itu2019s all changed without any note of that.   In the photo my hand is touching the new one. On the right is the old one."
