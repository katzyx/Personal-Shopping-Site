I was worried I wouldn’t find any moisturizer that would work for me and more so, one with any anti-aging ingredients. Then I tried this miracle product. This calmed everything down and made my face absolutely glow! It exceeded my expectations in every way and it would have been an absolute keeper even if my skin hadn’t been so irritable at the time. My skin has healed and I attribute that to this product and now I’m able to use other creams without issue - but I still use this every night and can’t recommend it enough. If it works for your skin then you’re in for a real treat. It soaks in well and leaves no residue (heavy creams just sit on my face) and is very hydrating. The corresponding serum is excellent as well and isn’t harsh on the skin."

It’s definitely very moisturizing (I have problems with dry skin and this keeps my skin hydrated). I have noticed my skin start to break out since using this, however. I can’t be 100% sure that it’s the cause, but the breakouts coincidentally started when I started this cream and I didn’t change anything else with skincare. It’s a very nice product, but I’d say for those with acne prone skin to proceed with caution."
