Setting spray is the product that I use up the quickest so it's nice to find something that will last awhile without breaking the bank. It has a really fine mist that dries quickly. This leaves a natural finish without that tight feeling. I just don't find that it locks in makeup, but blends everything together well."

I use up the regular size faster than other pump setting sprays (I find this typical with aerosols), so it‚Äôs nice to get a significant amount more product for an extra $10. I think this spray works phenomenally, and although it might not be a luxurious scent, it‚Äôs about how the product performs and this one is a chef‚Äôs kiss formula."

But with that being said I have tried many expensive high end makeup setting sprays and this is my ride or die. This product is a holy grail and it doesn‚Äôt compare in my opinion to any other spray out there. The mist is incredibly fine and like the name says; continuous. The scent is very mild and clean. The mist it‚Äôs self is non sticky, hydrating and feels refreshing. I may drench my face with this as I get a bit carried away but the application still looks flawless afterwards. Makes my skin look glowy and healthy and doesn‚Äôt look like I caked a bunch of makeup on. I don‚Äôt notice a huge difference in how long my makeup lasts compared to other sprays. But after wearing makeup for 8-10 hours I think it still looks pretty good! So happy it now comes in a jumbo size!!"
