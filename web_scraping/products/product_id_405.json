Which is odd to me, because I would think the people most likely to suffer from facial redness (pale girlies with pink skin) should be able to use this product, but no, Dr. Jart disagrees. So here we are. I threw it away after hate-using it for long enough to make me miserable, so sadly I don't have photos of how yellow it looked, but trust me when I say it was bad. Also the lemongrass smell is strong, and somewhat off putting the first few times I used it, but it's not a bad smell."

By the end of the day it aggravates my eczema, causing itchiness and then the redness gets worse :/. in sum, i found that this makes my eczema and redness worse. i am better off looking for solutions to the cause rather than just treating the symptoms (appearance of redness) with this"

Just to be safe I tried it with a clean cotton swab on my partners hand and the same thing happened. I’m so disappointed.  I am very pale, I wear a mac nw10, so maybe it’s only for darker skin tones. All the same, you’d think the orange would be advertised."

I have dry acne prone skin and I wanted something with light coverage that would even out the redness on my skin to wear alone, and this delivered (bonus points for SPF).  It's perfect for a my-skin-but-better kinda product, if I know Im going to be working hard and sweating I'll add a light dusting of powder all over and setting spray andits's amazing. With that being said, I'm very fair and this works well for me, but if you have a deeper skintone (probably any deeper than light-medium), this will probably be too light. It would be awesome if they expanded their shade range to include more!"

I actually use it in conjunction with a few drops of Bio-Oil, as it helps it spread easier and helps with the appearance of my hyperpigmented acne scars.  I love that I can use it as a sort of BB cream. I am extremely pale, and there are literally NO brands I have ever been able to find that make a BB cream formula light enough for me.  Again, being very pale, the fact that this includes SPF makes it a must have. I even have (a mild) intermittent rosacea, and this stuff conceals the redness in my face beautifully.  The Centella Asiatica in it is also UNBELIEVABLY great at healing the skin and supporting the skin barrier. I often see improvement in skin irritation overnight.  If you're also pale, however, I would start small with this one; any more than a small dab on a finger, and you run a slight risk of looking a ruddy orange color (especially true if you're not blending this down into the neck and decollette."

I am a very pale person (my foundation shade only exists in a handful of brands) and this would turn ORANGE on me. It's very streaky and blotchy so that combined with the orange makes me look like I'm experiencing a horrific case of jaundice. Also it seems very incompatible with all of my sunscreens and moisturizers as the product makes all of them pill. I am trying to using it as a makeup primer as I have no other way to use it and I refuse to waste product if it can be avoided. Also the smell of it is a little bit overwhelming and unpleasant.

First thing is you only need a little to go far but if you have more a darker tan skin tone and I’m azn, this doesn’t look good. It gives you a green film that doesn’t blend like the ads so sadly couldn’t use as a concealer/foundation and is very noticeable in regular lighting.

Lately I have been spreading a thin layer over the entire face, then going back in and dabbing a little extra on the areas that need a bit more help.

It’s a bit heavy, though, and tends to be drying. And, to me, the herbal scent is a bit off putting. I have very fair skin, but I can imagine it giving a white cast to deeper skin tones if worn alone. The best way to use it is sparingly and only where the redness is since that’s what the green color is designed for and, unless you have flushing all over, it’s not designed for use as a complexion product"

The smell is atrocious and it does linger for an hour or two before it's no longer noticeable. The beige colour correction is VERY beige so it has to be used under foundation. I typically opt for a tinted sunscreen or tinted moisturizer and they don't cover the beige hue of this, so just something to keep in mind. The product is also very oily. Like I'm talking I have to use at least two oil blotting papers plus a swipe of my volcanic rollerball after application to tame the oil that comes out of the product. Surprisingly I don't think the oil has made my acne worse but I'm wondering if that's less to do with the product and more to do with me making sure I blot all the oil off before I apply my makeup. It does do as intended though and really corrects redness and also tones down the look of angry acne for a more uniform colour once you apply foundation. I highly recommend it, just be informed about the product when purchasing and don't be surprised by the smell and the oils."

This lasts very well for me since I can dab aquaphor over this cream and the color doesn't move, which is helpful to stop it from flaking. I find that if I don't apply aquaphor over it, it dries out and begins flaking, but that happens with all makeup. The stand-out quality of this product is how well it lasts and the fact that I can put product over it and it stays put. It has my eczema-covered face looking the best it possibly can. It's very layerable and the color correction is effective. If you don't have a problem with flaking or don't need the tiger grass in this cream for soothing the skin, I would recommend finding a cheaper green color corrector, but as someone with awful flaking and irritation, I find this to be worth the price."

I don't find it leaves any odd cast to my skin tone, and I haven't had any skin issues since beginning to use.  For reference, I am oily and sensitive, and am usually med pale. I bought the small size and will definitely be repurchasing."

Cicapair tones it down almost completely. I normally don’t have that much redness though and use Cicapair to even out my skin tone (my cheeks have patches of mild redness and hyperpigmentation) when I don’t feel like wearing makeup. This product has a slight yellow shade to it to cancel out the redness. A little goes a long way, so start off with a thin layer and let the colour adjust to your skin for a few mins. Even though I don’t consider this to be makeup, it does sit similar to foundation on my face, and it can show texture if you look closely or if I have too thick of a layer. I also look jaundiced if I apply too liberally. Overall, I think this would work really well for people with rosacea and redness, based on the results in the photo, when my face was reacting to the lactic acid treatment I did."

This stuff just doesn’t equate to much.  I’m not saying don’t try it, but know that what it does doesnt justify the price. The coverage it gives is no different from a sheer colour corrector or a green tinted primer (think smashbox.)   I tried this a few different ways and this is what I found: It did tone down my redness in areas that I spot treated and built upon, but there’s a wasn’t any miracle happening. I’m not sure why some people say it made them orange… they must be pretty pale. I’m pale but I use tanning drops just for some glow, and this stuff made me look grey. I kept waiting for it to oxidize and look at least a little yellow.   I’d did start to pill on my face after about an hour of being on. I followed the directions and moisturized first. A moisturizer that is thicker (I have dryer skin,) but I can load up on and apply concealer soon after with no problems. This product was the only thing so far to pill with my moisturizer.  Overall, I’d say try it for yourself, but I was looking for something closer to skincare than makeup to reduce red spots so I could wear less makeup or even no makeup looks, but this wasn’t it. It works to some degree, but not enough to justify the price"

I literally put this on after moisturizing (all about the prep) and it’s literally all I need for a blurring effect, IF you put it on the correct way. It has SFP which is amazing. Beach day, hiking day, who needs makeup when you have this color corrector that acts like a veil and it’s good for your skin! Despite the negative comments, I will keep buying because it genuinely works wonders for my skin tone and has multi-benefits. I can definitely see how it might not work for darker skin tones.

I'm on the pale side and it made me look whiter than usual so if you have any melanin i would not recommend this product at all. I LOVE how healthy and soft my skin feels a few hours after application and even more so after washing my face but the first few hours are not worth that later feeling, especially at this price point.

			"review_text": "I hated this product when I first got it so badly that I made sure to warn all of my girlfriends against it. Now, after working with it a few times, I think I now have a much more balanced perspective on its pros and cons. It's a great colour-correcting BB cream, as long as you do NOT use it as an SPF. I'm a big sun-protection advocator and use SPF50 365 days a year, shine or rain. I got this product as part of a value set and was shocked by how bad it looked as an SPF when I first used it. I have very light olive skin with some small areas of redness. So I was looking forward to the effects this products might give me with the added benefit of an SPF 30 sun-protection. For its sun-protection function to be fully effective, the amount of product you have to use will make your face a lifeless beige mask. And with that amount of product, I find that it does not set fully and will move around which makes it unsightly if you wear glasses or mask. However, if you ignore the fact that it has an SPF of 30 and only use it as a colour-correcting BB cream, it is very easy to apply (on top of other sunscreens that I have) and looks very natural since you will need to only use the amount needed to cover redness and even skin tone, which is much less. I use it instead of foundation or concealer on days when I don't want or need a full face of makeup. For this product, I believe it's an either-or situtaion. If you want the sun-production, you are going to look like a mannequin. If you want your skin to look natural and even-toned, you are exposing yourself to UV... Is it worth it? No, in my opinion. If you can ignore the SPF30, it's not useless."

My dermatologist was very impressed with the ingredients. Your skin tone is flawless and it gives you a youthful glow.  No need for any makeup it has amazing coverage.  I can't say enough good things about it, and have recommended it to so many people who also love it. It also smells amazing"

I bought some for my Dad who has similar issues and it's healed his skin as well so I know it's not just me.

I bought this thinking it would be perfect, moisturizing, calming, redness reducing, and SPF on top of my usual SPF? Holy grail! But it’s drying and sticks to my problem spots so much that unless I put a rich moisturizer and spf under it and set it with a hydrating facial mist, it’s worse than going out with all the flaws and redness exposed! I’m even researching other products I can buy to go with it to make it work better but really? For this price it shouldn’t require a ton of added steps to work! Probably won’t re-buy this one I’ll stick with a hydrating CC cream with spf 🙃"

It worked to conceal the redness, but it was so strong smelling and felt really greasy and heavy on my face. I never really felt like it dried, and after a couple of weeks it separated and there was a bunch of water on top. I've avoided using it since because I found it, honestly gross between the smell and the feeling on my face, and no matter how hard I blended or rubbed it in, the parts of my face that weren't completely red ended up with a green tint. So, I needed to go back over with a concealer--a pain when I just want light redness coverage and SPF. I used to use it faithfully, but the more I really fell out of love when I realized I just couldn't get used to the feeling of it.  3/5 stars: It works as promised, but is it really worth it?"

I have sensitive skin in the sense that if touched it becomes bright red. My skin also becomes very red from working out, or just sweating in general. This product really helps neutralizing my skin, and reducing my red splotches almost completely.   However, this product does not cover pimples or dark blemishes (as a reminder.) I would say this product is similar to a CC cream once worked into the skin. It is a thicker consistency than moisturizer, but it doesn’t feel heavy or like it’s clogging my pores.   I got the full size of this product at my local Sephora after talking with one of the employees about matching me to a foundation. She explained to me that this product will let all my other makeup appear it’s ‘true’ color on my face now that I don’t have to worry about the redness of my skin.   I’ve only used this product a few times, but it’s already a dream! I love that it gives a natural, dewy glow to my skin, along with covering redness. But a little powder on top makes the skin look more matte which is also gorgeous.   I add: concealer under my eyes and on any other blemishes I wish to cover, blush, bronzer, and highlight. It’s so simple, and wonderful to use for a “no makeup, makeup look.”"

I didn't notice any particular smell, and I didn't have any kind of reaction.

Not only does this provide the sunscreen my dermatologist says I should always wear, but it offsets the reddish tones in my skin and gives it a more matte appearance.

Redness did go away for 2-3 hours after I used this layered over usual moisturizer, it reminded me of the kind of color correct I get from zinc-based sunscreen. But after 6-7 hours, it became patchy and weird due to my oily skin breaking through its barrier. It is decent moisture for me, didn't make me more oily than usual. Gave it 3 stars but I can't blame the product for my oil.. but redness claim was short effect."
