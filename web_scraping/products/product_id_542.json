I like how it doesn't sting my eyes and thoroughly cleans my face of makeup and impurities, without making my skin feel tight or irritated. I use a scrub afterwards to clear my pores. I switch products occasionally because it's expensive! I buy the value size when it's available. I prefer the value-size tube because it's easier to use in the shower, but it's not available on a regular basis.  A reminder to those of us with sensitive skin and/or allergies: always do a patch test. The correct way for cleansers, according to the American Academy of Dermatology: apply the cleanser to a quarter-size spot, twice a day for 7-10 days. I tested it on the underside of my arm, near my elbow. Apply a normal amount and rinse as you would usually do, according to the directions on the product. If you don't have any reaction, go ahead and use it."

Literally the only cleanser that has never burned or irritated my eyes. I have used soy cleanser for years, left and tried others, but always go back to it so I think I'll stay for a while. I just purchased her again and had to come share my love for it. Just so obsessed! Highly recommend!!!"

This product, while incredible, does not justify the expense. The amount you actually need to remove the makeup as advertised does not make this product a value size, especially at the new price point, and absolutely does not justify spending a $100 per purchase. The regular size is more like a mini/trial size and won’t last you long. The mini is basically a one and done. I will be visiting other cosmetic stores to find my new cleanser. This is not good business, coming from almost two decades of customer loyalty."

It’s not absolutely awful, but it’s not nearly as hydrating, light, and cleansing after the gym or hot weather hikes. It’s never been drying at all, ever. This cleanser and the Black Tea line (especially eye cream) have been in my constant regular rotation. I appreciate the desire to create clean products but I’m never buying these products at this increased point when the results aren’t even remotely as consistently amazing as they’ve been for decades. I used yo buy all the Fresh face masks, this soy cleanser and several of the Black Tea products. First they started creating smaller quantities for higher prices. I still bought them. Then they started filling them only partially full. Now this new, inferior formula? It’s not horrible and I didn’t have an adverse reaction, but, it’s just not giving me any fresh, clean, dewy skin and brightened up eyes. Such a shame! I loved this brand. If you’re looking for this original soy cleanser please be forewarned that the new clean products aren’t worthy of your precious coins. Sad."

Tried it multiple times and I still had leftover makeup on a cotton round after using micellular water on my face post face-wash. For a product THIS expensive? Completely bottom of the barrel. Waste of money, cleans nothing, and yes there is such a thing as too gentle which this cleanser is. Your skin doesn't even feel soft or smooth after, it feels like someone tried to clean it but stopped halfway through so your skin is somewhat de-hydrated and tight.

Out of the many drugstore/brand cleansers, this one is a nice addition to skin routine."

Maybe it's because this isn't a traditional soapy or foamy cleanser, it's a nice cool gel that is very gentle. I like to massage it onto my face for a minute or two before rising off. I use a separate eye makeup remover to get my mascara off but I like that I can use this to gently clean the eye area again to get any last traces off. I use this twice a day, since I have such oily skin, I have to wash my face in the morning and this works perfectly to clean and prep my skin for the day. My skin is soft and the oil reduced without being tight and dried out. Overall this is worth the price for me, it is more expensive than I'm used to but worth it to me. Give it a try!"

I've struggled with cystic hormonal acne for 12 years, seeing various dermatologists and trying so SO many products. I was finally at a point where my acne was mostly better thanks to my routine, but I would still get a buildup of whiteheads under my skin and during my cycle they would erupt into painful cysts without fail.  I tried this cleanser as a sample about a month ago and since starting with it, my whiteheads have greatly reduced. While I did still have a few spots during my cycle, they were little surface level pimples that cleared up in a day or two instead of painful lumps that take weeks to heal. I will say that I experienced a bit of redness at first that cleared up in a day or two and that I have to work a bit harder to keep my skin hydrated, but it is also winter. Also, I could definitely see how the smell might not be for everyone. It has a VERY strong cucumber extract smell. But all in all, the reduction in my acne makes those minor complaints well worth it."

My facial skin type is oily/combination-dehydrated and I prefer a touch of hydration when washing it - which this doesn't deliver, though I still think it's a fantastic cleanser. The texture is like a transparent jelly which foams up whilst working into my skin and rinses off quite easily. Despite the claims, it isn't the best at removing makeup, and I usually need to use my DHC (or other) oil-based cleanser first, before using this if I'm wearing anything more than foundation and concealer. Mascara has no chance! The ingredients are for the most part, very natural and beneficial. This is one of those cleansers that feels like it's contributing to the health of your skin, rather than taking anything away. I do find it pricey for what it is, but considering the ingredients, the glow I get when using this, and the 'simple yet elegant' tube packaging that I love having next to my bathroom sink, I definitely plan on re-purchasing this one once it finishes.   ~ My Sephora Top 7 must-have list ~  (My top 7 must-have beauty products of all time, focusing mainly on my purchases at Sephora)  1.

Gentle gel formula, doesn't irritate my skin, not drying but still cleanses well, foams just the right amount. One of the things I love most is that it removes all of my makeup including eye makeup without stinging. This is huge because I am way too lazy to use a separate product to remove my eye makeup. My skin has been so calm and clear since using this. I left the house without makeup this morning after about a week and a half of using this, which I never do. I am a product junkie and I'm always switching things up, but I've tried so many cleansers and I think I'll stick with this one.

Yes, I am not a huge fan of fragrance but the fragrance in this wash is light like a spa. It does not linger once you rinse it off. love the fact that I can wash my eyes lids in the morning time and experience zero stinging/irritation. I've went through multiple bottles of this product. I am so glad after all these years that fresh has not changed the formula or any of their ingredients. Although I've ventured out to other face washes but nothing has tends to provide me the same satisfaction as the fresh soy cleanser. I've tried fresh milk cleanser once which is okay as well. Maybe I will try there milk cleanser again come the winter but however I can use this gel cleanser all year round without any issues. I personally do not like spending a lot of money for a wash off product but it is something about this product that I really enjoy. I do not wear heavy make up so I can not speak upon the effectiveness for removing make up. Honestly you just can not go wrong.   *I've purchase this product with my own funds. My skin type is combo with dryness on the cheeks, and oily in the t-zone. Somewhat acne prone (blackheads and pimples)."

I also always leave a bottle of this cleanser in our guest bath because it feels luxurious and special and it is gentle enough for all skin concerns.  I am never without this cleanser and I even stock smaller bottles of this product for travel.  By the way, the larger size lasts me for months so it doesn’t even feel splurge-y at $38.

I have quite dry skin on my face, and had tried many other gentle cleansers before finding this, and have also tried others since when I've tried to find less expensive cleansers or gotten free samples, including the Drunk Elephant, First Aid Beauty, Cerave, and Cetaphil ones, which I know work well for others but for me just almost instantly made my face feel tight before I could even get my face moisturized post-cleanse (and then like thirty minutes post-moisturizing it would start to feel tight and dry again). Not saying that those don't work for a lot of people but just that if you've experienced issues with other gentle skin cleansers this could work for you!  I especially love that I can use it over my eyes. I do a couple times a week use it after an exfoliator (Lush's Let the Good Times Roll, sorry Sephora)."

Before this I was using a really gentle flaming face wash from my derm but I like this even more. My face is clean without feeling tight after I use this and the scent is lovely without being harsh or irritating. I don’t buy very much skincare at all outside of my dermatologist’s office because so much of it has heavy fragrance or irritating sulfates and I just don’t trust most brands anymore but this is 10000% worth it.

I had purchased a gift set of about five fresh items including the face wash and a toner so I dove in expecting tight skin from the wash. But I got soft skin! What a shock! This could not be true not on my skin that has always been like a prune. I carried on with the toner and moisturizer and felt divine. I tried again that night thinking it had been a fluke and same thing. Soft skin! This little tube lasted for a full month and I finally replaced it with a full size. I expect it will last at least six months so do not let the price of the Fresh poroducts sway you. You only need a tiny amount. As an added recommendation, when using the toner with the roses I would suggest pouring it directly into your hand and then patting it onto your face and that way you will waste far less product than if you pour it into cotton. I intend to purchase that next but hoping it comes on sale as I intend to get the large bottle and I will need more cream by then as well argh it never ends."

It helps my redness, calms my skin, and gives it a nice glowy, supple, hydrated look. The gel formula feels nice and it has some sort of cool feeling and a fresh smell to it, although some people say it smells bad, I like it.

It's great in this way, because I'm able to remove any traces of eye makeup as this doesn't sting my eyes at all. It also works great on its own if I'm not wearing makeup or something light. I tried the Glossier Milky Jelly cleanser as a possible replacement, but that one did not do as good of a job at removal, had a terrible scent, and stung my eyes."

I struggle with finding good cleansers because even though I get oily and am prone to breakouts, cleansers advertised for acne and oily prone skin, will dry my skin out and and cause me to flake.   If you have this issue as well, try a gentle cleanser (like this one) and treat the acne, pores, oiliness, etc…,with separate masks, spot treatments, or exfoliators.   This cleanser is great because it washes all the grime and muck off my face, makes you feel fresh and hydrated after rinsing, and for me, personally, has reduced my oil production significantly.   If you don’t want to commit to trying the value-size bottle first, buy the trial size so you can give it a test run. If you end up liking it, definitely consider buying the value size, because a little goes a long way. :)"

It also didn’t feel like it was cleaning any thing at all. If anything, it just felt like I was spreading slime on my face and having to use a looooot of water trying to rinse it off. When I first used it in the evening, I tested how much dirt/makeup it was removing by wiping my face with micellear water afterwards and it was like I hadn’t even washed my face. Plus it made me break out (probably because it wasn’t cleaning properly). Anyways, if you like to actually clean your face, not sure this would be the best product for you."

It’s been about a month of daily use. It doesn’t work for hormonal breakouts, but…it’s not supposed to. It gets my skin nice and clean and removes sunblock and mascara and light foundation/tinted moisturizer (I have not tested full coverage foundation). It doesn’t strip my skin or irritate and dry out the dry spots in my combination complexion. It has a great slippery texture that allows you to put it strait to work in your face without having to wet your face or lather the product. I just wet my hands a little. It is pricey! I initially purchased it with a gift card which is why I splurged but now I’m addicted. I use it 5-6 times a week as my main (morning/night) cleanser and I use about a nickel sized (sometimes quarter) glob. If you have drastically combination or dry skin I recommend you try it. My dry spots are very dry and my oily spots are very oily. It seems to prevent blackheads and whiteheads really well. It’s worth it especially at the sale price."

Some of these negative reviews mention that the soy face wash doesn’t perform well on makeup removal. I also noticed the frequent comparison between the soy face wash with some makeup-removal-only products. Whichever face wash you use, double cleansing is the foundation of skincare. Soy face wash is pretty much a face wash that can effectively remove a small amount of remaining makeup, just like any other face wash. You will not see this product perform well solely as a makeup remover; Get a makeup remover with this product. This is one of the best face washes you can find from the market regardless."

It is so incredibly gentle get effective for makeup removal. However, don’t just use this cleanser to remove layers of makeup!! Always make sure to double cleanse!! I use an oil based balm to remove my makeup, then follow up with this to ensure everything (oil, sweat, dirt & makeup) is removed. The cleanser does not burn my eyes, which is huge considering my eyes are extremely sensitive and I have bad reactions to a lot of fragrances in skincare.  The cleanser will leave you feeling supple and hydrated. It does not strip, if a cleanser strips your face, get rid of it. The price is hefty but you definitely don’t need a lot to use. It foams easily and goes a long way.   Fresh has 25% right now and I think that anyone wanting to try this cleanser just needs to do it because it’s amazing and is great for anyone!"

Wish I noticed more long term skin benefits though."

I use this in the shower to remove makeup and/or just to clean my face after a long day along with my silicone face scrubber.  This takes off my Tarte Lights, Camera, Lashes mascara after just a gentle scrubbing, whereas a regular makeup wipe would take longer and require more rubbing.  I will say though that if I have a full face of makeup on (foundation, concealer, eyeliner, mascara, lipstick, etc.), I will do a double cleanse or use a makeup removing wipe prior to make sure it is all off.  It also has not caused me any issues with skin sensitivity nor does it make my eyes burn.  This also has not left my skin feeling stripped or dry, it leaves my face feeling smooth and clean and has not caused me to break out.  The cucumber scent can be a little overpowering when you first start to use it, it literally smells like you're rubbing a fresh cut cucumber on your face, but I don't notice it much anymore.  I purchased the 5.1oz tube in October 2020 and still have around half of it left after around six months of daily pea-sized usage, so I would say its worth the cost.  I was previously using The Ordinary's Squalane Cleanser, but I feel like this one does a better job overall."

I used it a good handful of times to give it a chance, but after every time I used it, I ended up with pretty red irritation bumps on my chin and around my nose.

I have extremely dry/dehydrated skin and at the time that I purchased this I had a head cold and my nose was completely raw and dry with flakes from it.  Gross,  I know, sorry.  But what impressed me so much is that whenever I used this product, almost immediately,  the tip of my poor nose was now soft and all the flaky skin vanished.  MIND BLOWN.  My skin is often dry and flaky and this cleanser makes my face so smooth and I never get that tight feeling, however, it does a pretty efficient job of cleansing away any makeup etc. Or at least breaking down hard to budge mascara/eyeliner.  I also like that this doesn’t foam up a ton.  It’s a nice jelly consistency with a light froth but nothing over the top.  My skin has transformed and this is only after using it for less than one week!  Best cleanser ever hands down."

It felt like I was rubbing pure aloe on my face ? No feeling of cleaning ? Maybe if you have super sensitive/dry skin this would work for you. I even gave my bottle to my mom thinking it would work for mature skin. And I noticed it’s been sitting in her washroom untouched for a year now. So she must have not liked it either ?

I stopped using this when I received the Drunk Elephant Jelly Beste 9 birthday sample and I felt a difference. I felt a bit of residue and oily pores remaining after using the Soy Fresh Cleanser but Drunk Elephant left my face feeling more cleansed, nicely tighter, not oily."

It's a liquid-y gel that effortlessly glides on your skin, so keep in mind that a little goes a long way - which is a HUGE plus given the steep price. It also feels amazing, and makes your skin feel squeaky clean without feeling dry at all, considering this is coming from a girl with dry skin. This is absolutely worth every penny.

I have struggled with acne my entire life and have sensitive skin too, so it has been challenging to find a cleanser that actually cleans my skin without irritating it or drying it out.  Previously I used Purity Made Simple or Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser. Both are good, but didn't clean my oily pores enough, especially during the summer months.  The only downfall of this product is that if can be drying if you  don't moisturize properly. In the winter months, for example, I had to switch from a lighter moisturizer like Caudalie's Sorbet moisturizer to Biossance's Omega Repair. I also incorporated nightly face oil into my skin regimen.   Additionally, this product doesn't always effectively remove stubborn eye makeup and rubbing it vigorously along the lash line can irritate the skin. So, what I do is remove eye makeup with Drunk Elephant's Slaai Cleansing Bomb, then wash my entire face with this product."

It will get rid of any makeup residue missed by the cleansing oil.  I do love the smell (a strong rose scent with cucumber) as it reminds me of a luxurious spa experience, but it could be toned down a bit.

I don’t use any heavy or waterproof make up (only CC cream, tinted blush, and sometimes eyeliner), so this product is ideal for me.

First, it doesn’t lather, which is weird as a face soap; so I ended using more than usual and it still didn’t cleanse my face or remove any makeup off. It also clogged my ores and made me break out. I got fed up and threw it away within a week. It had a weird sticky, tacky, gel-liquid texture that I was not happy about. After looking at the ingredients, I realized that it has glycerin (which doesn’t clog pores and is a humectant to add moisture, is good for sensitive and dry skin, but also gives products that tacky texture), several (too many in my opinion) different oils (sunflower oil, castor oil, & soybean oil), and silica (which is essentially silicone-it can get into your pores and clog them and cause break-outs)."

I started breaking out again (nothing severe just really bothered me) so I have recently switched to origins checks & balances frothy face wash and have seen a significant change in clearing my breakouts. They are now rare but still hormonally noticeable at times. But, the soy face wash wasn’t helping anymore so, maybe if you have dry skin this is the way to go but if not it simply isn’t effective for you.

I'm used to creamy (Saturday Skin) and foamy (Neogen) cleansers, and some oil ones (like Purito and Boscia). This was neither an oil or foam. It felt more like slick snot on your face for lack of a better description. It didn't foam up. It just was. I did like that there was no residue and it rinsed off very nicely I am a fan of Fresh's other products I've tried, but this cleanser isn't for me. I dropped a star only for my personal distaste of the texture. I'll continue to use up my mini, but won't repurchase.

I can get dry, flaky skin especially around my nose, but I’ve never had a problem with this product drying out my skin! I also wrap up my skin care with the Fresh Lotus Youth Preserve Face Cream (which I also highly recommend) and the combo has helped brighten my complexion and reduce redness.   I knocked off one star only because when I use a toner afterwards, I sometimes still see leftover dirt/oil, but this normally happens after wearing a full face of makeup so it can be hard to get it all off with one cleanser."

Ran out of Purity cleanser and tried this while my Philosophy order is on the way.  One use dried my cheeks out terribly, they're rough/patchy almost like fine sandpaper, even with using my again oil.  I have two large cysts forming on my upper cheek toward the outside of my face, as well as several smaller bumps/whiteheads.  One use of this cleanser completely undid all the work into getting my skin into shape.  I am so frustrated and angry right now.  I thought this was supposed to be gentle but it dried my face out worse than any foaming cleanser I've ever used."

It doesn't leave mt skin dry AT ALL. It doesn't overly strip my skin, but when I go in with my toner afterwards, I don't find any dirt leftover. However, do note that I do NOT wear any makeup! So, how this does taking off makeup, I don't know. But, for people who dont wear it, I'd recommend this product! I do have Combination skin, so those who have very oily skin may not see the same results as me."

I love natural products so I give it extra points for that. I have good skin for the most part. I don't need alot of sophisticated cleansers or deep cleaning for my face. This face wash is perfect for on the go people. It's not too cleansing and something in it is slightly acidic maybe so it kinda exfoliates your skin. But it doesn't leave your skin with that squeaky clean feeling. It leaves your skin relatively mate all day long. Even I've worked many jobs where I walk around alot and sweet and cleaning etc. Ive worked alot in kitchens for example. This cleanser will hold you over when you feel I don't have time or motivation to properly cleanse my skin. Even when I wear makeup after cleansing my skin is still mate many hours later. It's also a great makeup remover. Good for taking to work or maybe the gym etc. I highly doubt you'll regret buying this product. If you doesn't work for you I will almost guarantee you a friend or family member will love it! Five stars all the way."

And while I’m often skeptical about whether you get substantial results from ingredients like soy and aloe (in a wash-off form especially), this product offers a sufficiently thorough, gentle cleanse that leaves my skin feeling hydrated and supple. I like this cleanser--quite a lot, in fact. But: nearly $40 for 150 ml is easily more than double its worth. And I think Fresh has attempted to justify this product’s high price point by advertising the cleanser as this 3-in-1 cleansing makeup remover with toning effects. It’s a cleanser, and a really lovely one. But be wary of this makeup removing face wash advertising: it is not as effective a makeup remover as a balm, cream, or oil, and so I find this product best used as the second part of a two-step cleansing routine. And as for its effects as a toner--I would assume that the product’s inclusion of rose and cucumber is for the sake of its (divisive) fragrance more any reliable outcomes in balanced skin. If this product were $15, then we’d be talking; but I won’t be spending $38 on a cleanser when I can find excellent alternatives for less than $10."

So this can be used to clean off mascara and liner from the eyes without irritation.  For a cleanser to be that strong/effective yet so gentle that you can literally get it in your eye without discomfort is miraculous.  Overall though skin appears advisably cleaner after use, it leaves skin looking so fresh and glowy.   I would strongly recommend trying this product.    With that suggestion I'll be honest that I've tried numerous face masks and scrubs by this company and have not been impressed or repurchased any other item in their line except for this face wash---it's that special.

I do use make up wipes prior to using this product but this takes off any residue. Leaves your skin feeling refreshed, smooth, glowy and soft. I use it day and night. If you’re considering this product, just get it! Fresh products are all amazing!!"

My skin is really sensitive and it’s usually pretty clear, so this is perfect for me. I love the soft consistency and clean smell, and really have yet to find anything like it. I’m also sometimes prone to facial dermatitis, and on those days the soy immediately calms it down and makes me feel refreshed. I have the jumbo bottle (almost out) and repurchased the mini for travel after I ran out. Fresh has so much money from me over the years lol.  If you’re looking for a deep clean or something stronger for troubled skin, skip this or only use it when your skin is feeling irritated."

It doesn't leave me feeling dry or tight after washing my face, but I'm now wowed by it. It feels fairly clean but I will say that it's not the best at getting any remnants of makeup off like most cleansers do in a double cleanse. Also, the smell is not something I'm a big fan of. I almost gag when I first squeeze the product out of the tube and quickly wash my face because of the scent.  I know many say that this cleanser is great for all skin types, all the time but this was no good for my combo skin in the winter. I had to switch to a much creamier cleanser based on my aesthetician's suggestion. For the price of it, I think you can find a better cleanser elsewhere."

The packaging description claims an extra-gentle gel cleanser that instantly whisks away everyday impurities and makeup... without stripping the skin of essential moisture.' It'll take off makeup as any cleanser would, but it's not especially targeted as a ~makeup remover~ would be. As a face cleanser, it does the trick beautifully, which I always expect from Fresh. It spreads well without foaming and skin feels refreshed afterward. It's a pleasant experience and a little goes a long way. However, when it comes to cleansers, I think you have to do a lot to justify this price -- and while it's a good product, I don't think it's worth paying extra from drugstore cleansers unless you have especially sensitive or acne-prone skin that responds well to it. So! 3-stars for delivering on the goods but not quite being worth the cost."

I use this with the lotus preserve face cream and let me tell you my skin never looks so good. I’ve struggled with dark spots for over 10 years and for the first time in a long time I feel normal again! I’ve tried everything even prescribed topical gels, washes from my dermatologist and they do not do a thing. Try it you might like it!"

I’ve noticed that my face looks brighter and I’ve also noticed that my skin has been softer."

But come on it’s 2020 let’s get some makeup remover and do the double cleanse! Also this will NOT sufficiently tone your skin (depending on your skin type). This cleanser is not drying by any means, but if you’re a little on the drier side, and you just skip your toner thinking that this is really a 3-in-1 product, your face will be uncomfortable. Again, this is an excellent CLEANSER, I’m just taking off one star because the majority of complaints come from people whose expectations were a little off due to the “3-in-1” description."

This product doesn’t irritate my acne-prone skin at all and does an amazing job at making your face feel clean but not stripped/tight. It has a slimy consistency (not as weird as it sounds) which turns into a gentle lather and a subtle fresh cucumber scent (not overwhelming). I know it’s a bit pricy but it’s worth it. A little goes a long way and I find I can get about 2 months worth out of the full size when washing twice daily."

I suffer from dry skin and severe eczema. After washing with this cleanser, my skin didn't feel as tight as it usually does.

My favourite part of this cleanser is you can use it on your eyes - important to me because a facial cleanser should be used on your eyes too (are your eyes not part of your face??). If a face wash has chemicals that sting the eye, that concerns me, but this removes everything without making my skin uncomfortable! There is a light cucumber scent and the feeling after rinsing it off feels like my skin is already toned and prepped for moisturizer. I highly recommend this as it worked great for me."

More than often, I ended up squeezing way to much product out and ran out in couple months. I eventually forgot about it and my concerns, bought the cleanser AGAIN thinking I’d give it a shot. To me it’s not the best because I don’t find it very effective in terms of makeup removal, bang for the buck, and consistency is a little too jelly like for me.

I told her I tried first aid’s face wash but didn’t get a lather and was disappointed she went and grabbed a tube of this and but a dab on my hand with water. I couldn’t believe how soft it made my skin.   Fast forward to the present: I keep a tube in the shower and one by the sink. My husband who suffered from terrible cystic acne as a teen and occasionally as an adult has been using this and last month I noticed his acne scars didn’t look as pronounced as they used to and that his skin was so soft and clear! He loves it, I love it and I hate that I didn’t find this sooner!   It has a light cucumber smell, comes out clear and isn’t a very sudsy lather but I definitely can tell it’s getting my face clean and as soon as I rinse my skin is super soft!"

She said this was a game changer for her skin, and let me use it at night for 3 days straight. The first day after using it the night before, I woke up to soft, healthy and glowing skin! It was as if I had gotten a weekend full of 8+ hours of sleep, when in reality it was half that. As I continued to use it, I continued to see soft and supple skin. This was especially great because I use chemical exfoliators regularly and the weather here is super cold and drying to the skin. I can’t thank her enough for recommending this, and I can’t recommend it enough for everyone else. There’s a reason this has a huge following! I now use it nightly paired with a chemical exfoliating wash for the daytime and my skin looks better than it did in my 20s."

My skin immediately started to sting when I used this after my oil cleanser, and although it states it will take off all of your makeup - even mascara - I used The Ordinary's glycolic acid toner afterwards and STILL found traces of my foundation on my face. It's been about 10 minutes since I used the cleanser and my face is red and blotchy and feels really tight as if its drying out like a prune. So glad I didn't pay full price for this product.. would not purchase on it's own. I'll give it a few more tries before I toss it out.

I switched cleansers and pared down my skincare routine to bare bones and the breakout went away. Then I switched back to this cleanser because it DOES leave a nice texture to dryer skin, and my breakouts started immediately again within 12 hours.

The minimal ingredients and quality of them makes this perfect for my extremely sensitive skin. When I use this in conjunction with the Fresh Black Tea Kombucha Essence my skin is radiant, clean, and moisturized. In the past I have struggled to find a cleanser that didn’t dry out my skin, cause irritation, or leave a nasty residue. This cleanser is it. From day one I have had fantastic results with it. It leaves my skin soft, supple, and clean. I would highly recommend this product to anyone looking to amp up their skincare.   I received this complimentary from Influenster for the purpose of review"

The smell is not my favorite, but it is very light so it’s not a big issue to me. I’ve been using this cleanser for a few months now and my skin has been so supple, soft, and feels hydrated even before I apply anything else.   I recommend using this and then a gentle scrub or exfoliant followed by the fresh Black Tea Kombucha Facial Treatment Essence before applying your serums, creams, and moisturizers. If you have sensitive, dry, or combination skin, you can’t go wrong with this as apart of your daily regimen.   Sidenote: I had already bought the mini size cleanser in a Fresh set from Sephora and was actively using it when I received a complimentary deluxe sample from Influenster, so thank you for the extra supply because I was already smitten and about to go purchase the full size tube!   *I received this complimentary for testing purposes."

It’s appropriate to use any time of day but I usually use it at night as a second cleanse because it works really well to remove any remaining makeup product that the first cleanse didn’t catch and it won’t burn your eyes! If i could only use one cleanser for the rest of time, this would absolutely be my choice, hands down. In my opinion it’s for sure an amazing value for the price.

It feels like my face is actually being cleaned without being completely stripped of moisture because it is so gentle.  My skin feels so soft and it has made discolouration and red marks disappear and kept my breakouts down (but hasn't stopped breakouts completely).   I don't mind the smell either.  Great product :)"

It has a faint fresh cut cucumber smell. It doesn’t leave a residue on my face or strip away too much oils leaving me dry. I would give it 5 but I did find that it doesn’t easily wash away all makeup and usually need to use an oil cleanser or makeup remover for the more stubborn makeup."

Whenever I try to get rid of my acne the products are so harsh they irritate my sensitive skin they turn my skin blood red and sensitive to the touch. Whenever I use something that's usually sensitive for my skin it never works for my acne and sometimes it makes my acne worse. This product did none of that. It washed my face intensely without drying my skin out or irritating my sensitive skin and it almost completely eliminated my acne. You should give it a try."

The only reason it doesn't get 5 stars is because it still doesn't leave my skin as refreshed looking as SR's Ceramic Slip formula (before the horrible change) and that's the standard by which I now measure all cleansers."

It is fragrance free, however has natural scent of cucumber and rosewater extract.

It is a bit pricey but I received this product as a free sample and the size of the squeeze bottle is quite large. I can see it being a staple to my skincare routine but because of the price I probably wouldn’t purchase it regularly. As for ingredients, they are relatively safe. Some reviews claim that the soy cleanser has parabens - not sure if this is true? I’ve tried to look into this and don’t recognize any ingredients as parabens but then again I’m not an ingredient expert nor did I take the time to look up every single ingredient. If it does have parabens, it’s well hidden. Regardless, this product is definitely better than most out there ingredient wise."

This cleanser is incredibly gentle, yet effective, and leaves my skin so soft and healthy looking. I’ve been using this product after removing my makeup at bedtime and it does an incredible job of removing any remaining impurities without irritating or stripping my sensitive skin. The gel cleanser is easily and evenly spread onto the skin and a little bit goes a long way. After using this for the last few weeks I have not experienced any breakouts on my sensitive skin. The only issues with the cleanser for me are the price and the smell. I find it to be extremely pricey and it smells terrible. Other than that, it’s an incredible cleanser and I will continue to use it but am unsure if I would purchase it again based on price."

I already reviewed the Sugar Strawberry Exfoliating Face Wash, which I personally favored of the two, but this is still a great face wash and one I can see many loving. It is a simple tube with a snap cap and comes in a clear, gel form. The fragrance gives me cucumber and soy, which I found refreshing and not very strong, but if you're sensitive to either of those, just be mindful. This was extremely  gentle on my skin which is on the sensitive side. It didn't lather much, but it did leave my skin clean and not stripped of moisture. I had my boyfriend try it after he got sunburned to wash his face, and it was extremely gentle for him as well, while still cleaning his skin. Overall, I think this is a great option for those who have sensitive skin, or simply prefer a gentler but still effective facial cleanser."

I didn't really notice anything special about this cleanser. It did remove most of the makeup that my makeup remover wipe left behind, but it didn't remove the mascara so I had to go in with an eye makeup remover pad. It didn't seem to dry me out more than any of the other washes I use regularly, but it also didn't leave me feeling very hydrated either. I recieved this complimentary for testing purposes & I do not think I will repurchase when it's gone, but I will use it up."

I squeezed out the “normal” amount I use for face wash and started applying it on my skin. I quickly realized I used WAY too much! I learned my lesson and have only been using a pea size amount since. My blunder just goes to show you how effective this cleanser is.  The scent is also quite nice. It smells very fresh and clean, with a hint of cucumber, which I found to be very soothing. Although packaging doesn’t affect how effective the product is, I do appreciate the simple design, and easy to use squeeze bottle.  As a side note…I love the fonts Fresh uses on their packaging! I can’t be the only one who loves a good font.  Although it is a gel base, its super rich and a little does go a long way–so the value is great! After washing it off with water and patting my face dry with a towel, I noticed that not only did my skin feel clean, it felt soft. I have never used a cleanser that made my skin feel like I had already put my serums, moisturizers etc. on it. With other products I have found that my natural oils have been drawn out, which isn’t a huge deal breaker for me, as I put oils on my face anyway, but the Soy Face Cleanser preserved my skins structure, whilst cleaning out any impurities.  *Gifted Product*"

Well, that's good! No irritation whatsoever.   Every after use, my skin really felt soft and smooth. It really left my skin fresh and not stripped of moisture. I've not put on mascara these past few days so I can't tell yet if it would be helpful in removing it, but I've put on CC cream, foundation, powder, blush, and they've been cleaned together with dirt.   I kinda was looking for the soapy, bubbly feel when I massage my face but this formula isn't. It just feels slippery when you massage it. It's also a plus because it doesn't have that strong scent. Instead, it gives the calming scent of of cucumber."

The scent is slightly like soy beans (edamame) but very faint and natural smelling. The cleanser is on the thinner side so not a lot is needed. My face felt so refreshed and clean afterwards. I feel like this would be a necessary splurge on the future and a great part of my skin routine."

It doesn't burn the eyes though, so that's a huge plus!! Immediately after using, it was a little red but it didn't feel dry at all, great for us dry skin folk! I didn't notice any radiance or immediate smoothness after using. So far, I have incorporated it into my routine as a morning cleanser when my skin needs extra nourishment. It's not great at removing makeup but as a morning cleanse or second cleanse, it's great and gentle. Warning though, if your skin is experiencing some irritation from other sources, avoid using this product until the irritation goes away. I'm thinking it's the fragrance that's irritating my skin.

A pro tip I’d like to add is to use a daily moisturizer after use to lock in that smoothness. Use daily. It’s so gentle on the skin. It’s not affected my skin in any way.

It feels gentle and nourishing, but at the same time it really removes all my makeup and leaves my skin feeling really clean.  I have really oily skin, so that in itself makes me feel kinda gross sometimes, but this really does make me feel fresh (no pun intended), but I also use liquid liners quite often, which can be difficult to get off, especially the lash line, yet this removes my with little effort (and scrubbing) and it doesn't irritate my eyes or skin.

I wear a full face of makeup almost everyday which, I've always loved PTR because it washes all the make off effortlessly, but I've found it can also leave me a bit extra dry when my skin is just tired and dehydrated. The Soy Face Cleanser is the perfect alternative for those days. It does take a bit more effort to take off mascara and liquid liner, I would suggest using maker remover or oil to help remove the makeup. Otherwise, I love the fresh scent, cooling and hydrating feel of this cleaner. Plus this tube will last me most of the year."

It removes makeup very well (it would make a great first step in any double wash regimen), helped even my skin tone, didn’t smell like chemicals, and was gentle. Unfortunately, several years later, my skin started breaking out again, so I switched to a different oil-free cleanser. Regardless, I highly recommend this cleanser if you have dry, sensitive skin."

I am not saying that it worked a miracle, because I have experienced issues with my skin for a long time and do not expect one product to change that. However, the day after I started using this cleanser I saw a big difference! My pores felt clean, and my skin tone was even. I also noticed that while it worked well do help with the pimples on my face,  but it did not dry or irritate my skin! It does smell like cucumbers, but the scent isn't too strong.

I tried it for about a month and some change and I just didn’t love it. It didn’t make me breakout or anything but I never felt like it really dug deep down into my pores and cleaned my skin. I always felt like this product sat on top of my face instead of actually cleaning my face. Not only that, it never gave me a glow. I only continued to use it because I loved the consistency and the smell didn’t bother me; however, once I ran out, I knew I had to try something else because this wasn’t it. I am currently using the Farmacy Clean Bee Ultra Facial cleanser and I can honestly say I love it and feel that it works great with my oily/combination skin."

After using, my face feels clean and fresh--it takes off layers of sunscreen and makeup, and is gentle even on the eyes.   It's not a 'makeup remover' per se, so I usually need to use a separate makeup remover if I wore heavy makeup that day for a night out or fancy event, but otherwise it does a really great job of taking off street makeup that I wear to work and leaving my skin clean and residue free.  It doesn't lather, it's more like a gel, so know what you're walking into, and that you need to rinse thoroughly. I use it morning and night with none of the sensitivity issues or overdrying that I've had with other cleansers. Blackheads and oil is controlled well with this.  The Sephora write up also cites that this addresses fine lines and wrinkles and loss of firmness--I didn't notice an uplift on those, which is my only disappointment. That being said, since it's very gentle and not highly drying, it's probably not harming your skin, where some of the harsher cleansers would cause harm. This wasn't a high priority for me in my cleanser. I correct for this in serums and moisturizers."

It is so gentle and it cleans my skin without drying it out. It is worth the largest size and works for all skin types as it says but, works the best with dry and/or sensitive skin.   For advice, I really recommend cleansing in circular motions and really get in there. It helped get rid of the small bumps on my forehead and it allows the rest of my skincare products to work and sit really well on my skin.  This is my only daily cleanser that I use both morning and night, and after removing my makeup. I hope this really encourages you guys to buy this because it is totally worth the money.

It's gentle, smells refreshing (like cucumbers), cleans my face well, and gets rid of any leftover makeup I have on. Although, I do use makeup remover wipes before washing my face if I'm wearing makeup.  It seems to get all the excess dirt and oil off my face. Unlike some other cleansers I've tried, the soy cleanser has never made me break out. The only downside, in my opinion, is that this face cleanser doesn't foam up at all, which I prefer because then I can see that I've cleaned all the parts of my face thoroughly, but oh well."

This might not be a problem for some people, but I personally don't like the smell of cucumber. It claims to be able to remove all of your makeup gently, and if by gently they mean not at all then its correct. I had fallen asleep with my makeup on so when I woke up my mascara had given me raccoon eyes, the cleanser couldn't even fully clean that up off of my cheeks.  Though it does to really well as a daily cleanser. I use it while I'm in the showers in the morning and it acts as a really nice pick me up for my skin to start the day. It also did help me clear up some of my acne. I just don't reccomend using it to take off your makeup."

If I use enough moisturizer after cleansing it’s okay, but it can be the tiniest bit drying if used straight.

Everyone raves about this product so I wanted to give it another try. And I'm glad I did!! I have completely changed my opinion. Holy grail! Gentle cleanser - soy proteins, rose water, cucumber extract - not foaming! Which I love. Ph level 5.3 - perfect!! Hydrating - does not strip the skin - a repurchase for sure. Not a good makeup remover thou. Use as a second cleanse. Every person should own this cleanser. I think a good price 38 for a 5 oz bottle."

I’m sure if I had a different skin type this product would have been fine, but unfortunately I have to return this as it doesn’t suit my face."

After years of back and forth between different cleaners I really have decided that this is the best overall facial cleaner that I have ever used.

Consistency: - Goes on smooth, really easily, glides on your face, almost like KY Jelly on a metal device for an ultrasound.  - It's not too thick, not too liquidy. - Doesn't foam or lather which is fine this allows you to control it and doesn't dribble into your eyes like some other cleansers. The formula glides and sticks to the face.  Smell: It was pleasant, like fresh cut cucumbers, it wasn't chemically it was nice, kinda organic. It didn't match the packaging and would picture this may sell better if it did have some mint green type of color or cucumbers on the package.  - The scent was only there when I was cleansing my face. As soon as I washed it it came off.  Feel: - It didn't burn my eyes. Some cleansers feel like chili when you rub your eyes to get the last mascara residue off this was nice. - It left my skin feeling balanced. Clean yet not dry.  - Did not leave a film or residue - Did not dry out my face - It did a great job of removing makeup much better than my Algenist.  Overall I really liked this cleanser and would continue to use it."

I bought a different cleanser after this one ran out just to try it, and those dry patches were back within 2 days. I had to switch back to this, it's the only thing that works for my dry and acne prone skin. Plus it smells so good! I will be using a glycolic acid toner after this to combat any textural issues, but for everything else this beats a lot of other cleansers I've used.

Because of this, one cleanser is usually never enough so this one didn't do the trick there, so I usually remove a lot with a cotton pad and baby oil, and then I rinse and massage this soy cleanser into my skin to remove the rest and it leaves my skin feeling fantastic. I follow up with moisturizer. For me the price is worth it because it's a perfect step 2 cleanser that doesn't irritate or break down my skin barrier."

I use it by squeezing some cleanser onto my palm, adding a little bit of water, then rubbing for a couple of seconds til it becomes a light lather. I then massage it onto my face for a minute or so, then rinse.  I do use a separate remover for my eye makeup, but accidentally got some of this cleanser in my eyes and it did not sting! OMG"

The cleanser itself is pretty lightweight and doesn't foam much as you wash. Although I'm a minimalist when it comes to makeup, it did seem like this did a good job removing my concealer, lipstick, and even mascara. My only wish is that it left my face feeling a little more hydrated when I was done using it. It certainly didn't feel like it stripped my skin at all, but it just didn't seem as moisturizing as some other cleansers I've liked. I still enjoy this and will use every drop, but it might be better suited for people with oily or combination skin."

From what I’ve read from other reviewers it seems like this was common if you have dry skin. I stopped using it and kept everything else that I normally use the same and my face isn’t breaking out anymore. Again it was a great cleanser to take off make up and really make my face feel clean, but obviously the breakouts weren’t ideal. I’d recommend getting a sample first if you’re considering or the smaller size (glad that’s what I usually get when trying a new skincare product). Anyways, I’m giving the rest to a friend who loves this and doesn’t break out from using it."

And Soy Face cleanser always does a great job of taking all the remaining dust, gunk and oil away. I rarely have a pimple showing up, and if it does, it's mostly because of other products/me touching my own skin with dirty fingers.

It takes off all traces of makeup, doesn’t over dry or over moisturize, and leaves my face feeling clean and natural. And the price is very reasonable for the product. Love it!"

AND THEN it knocked me over when it later helped remove grease paint residue, with soft skin left behind. It’s expensive, but it’s the best cleanser I’ve ever used so the function negates the price for me.   Oh, and I love the cucumber smell that seems to be a problem here."

My only complaint is that I hate the cucumber smell...but as I only have to endure it for 15 seconds I'll put up with it. I know it says it removes makeup but if I've got a full face on I ALWAYS use a wipe (ole henricksen) before washing my face to get most of it off and leave the soy cleanser to actually clean my skin."

I do like the cleanser and I wanted to love it but it has a hard time removing basic makeup. I had to scrub my eyes to get my eye liner off... and who wants to scrub soap into their eyes? no one. I have used other cheaper cleansers that have worked better.. like the FAB beauty cleanser. that one leaves the skin soft and clean. The Fresh cleanser leaves your face soft but doesn't do a good job of cleaning, so I can imagine pimple are soon to come if I keep using this. The texture is weird"

The scent is refreshing and wakes me up in the morning. Also feels like it really gets in there and washes any dirt,oil, and excess makeup off my face. The only negative thing I would say about this is that on my combination skin it makes my face dry. But thats why we have moisturizer."

As for the clean factor, I felt that it DID cleanse my skin, just not as well as other cleansers in its category. 2 of my biggest gripes with this cleanser are it’s smell, which for me personally was potent and pungent, and the texture. It felt like a combination between jello/shower jelly combined with freshly harvested seaweed. I couldn’t be happier to get this off my face. I really wanted to like this cleanser as some of the FRESH products I do enjoy, but sadly this one is not for me!"

I try to stay away from harsh products because recently my skin has become sensitive. This cleanser is sent by the gods. Its so gentle yet very effective. My skin always feels clean (removes makeup very well) and does not irritate it. The jelly consistency is fun and the light smell is lovely. The large size lasts forever, so the price is WORTH IT.  Overall, great year round cleanser for most skin types. It has made my skin look good. 10/10 would recommend to my friends, and even my enemies."
