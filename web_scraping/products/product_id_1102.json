I have pretty dark pigmentation under my eyes and i was after a full coverage concealer that would still feel light weight and breathable. So far I’m really impressed with how this one sits and blends into a very natural look.   TIP : if you have dark under eyes like me and want to cover them in one layer, apply the concealer to fully cover the dark areas and wait 2-5 mins for it to dry. Then buff it a bit and it will melt into your skin without compromising the coverage."

This was the only new product I used. I only wore it out to dinner, so it was only on my skin for several hours. It took almost a month for the breakout to heal, and I still have red marks where the zits were. Not worth it."

I just wish there were some olive options, but this worked okay and most brands don't have olive options anyway. I have dry skin and with just the moisturizer underneath I have had the least issues with this creasing and showing dry patches than anything else I have used.

Doesn't work for an under eye concealer for my mature eyes and is too light in coverage to cover any sort of darkness.  If this were to replace face concealer, eye concealer and foundation, I would need to buy 3 different colors.  Otherwise, it doesn't have a scent for those that need to know, is light coverage , can build slightly but not much, and I think would only work on those with almost perfect skin. Suggest swatching colors before purchase, online matching is off, especially for light to light-medium shades."

Warning for those who want full coverage and long-lasting wear: This will not be that product for you. I think that this is medium coverage and you can build it to be full coverage, but I feel it would get heavy. Additionally, this is a cream product that will move on the face and transfer if you touch it. I haven't tried it with a primer yet so maybe those issues could be mitigated, but if you're a makeup minimalist and want full coverage and transfer-proof this isn't for you. Additionally, some people have reported that their product fell out shortly after use, but mine hasn't yet. I'm not that gentle with it and the base of the stick does have a small crack, but seems to have held up so far. Maybe it's because I bought it in-store so it didn't get messed up in shipping."

One of the color sticks broke during the first use & the other broke after 2 or 3 uses. These were NOT turned up (since they come sticking out enough when first opened) nor did I use the pressure of a toddler with a crayon learning to color. They just BROKE FOR NO REASON...TWICE...because I returned the first one that broke. (Didn't have the mental energy to go back for a second return so I tried to fix them on my own. A fail, btw.)   They really need to fix this as well as the packaging. With regards to the packaging, the cap is very tight which is good because that means it's not going to just fall off. However, because about half an inch of the product comes already exposed/turned up in the tube, you have to be RIDICULOUSLY CAREFUL when pulling the tight cap off because it will hit the exposed product. So you end up with nicks in the product & color all over the inside of the cap.  This costs too much money for these kinds of quality issues.  Love my Merit bronzing stick though. They should mimic that kind of packaging & set up for this foundation/concealer stick."

I have fair skin with cool undertones and I could rent my skin out for science experiments looking to prove neutrality.  This comes up like just about every product claiming to be neutral -not at all neutral!  It's a very toasty apricot.   They are still lacking real, true, desaturated, almost grey neutrals and the photography is deceptive.  I could tell this was going to be orange the moment I took the cap off.  My experiment failed and this will go in the drawer with all the other non-neutral neutrals.    I wrote a review back when Merit first introduced this stick.  In it, I crunched the numbers on how this is basically the most expensive foundation stick out there, gram for gram.  If you love it, you might think it's worth it.  Otherwise, I'd probably look elsewhere.  I find the formula a tad dry on my normal-dry skin, but better (though actually more $$) than WA. You must prep very well."

I have combo skin with huge pores that are prone to congestion, so most base products usually feel too heavy/suffocating for me. this is seriously the most weightless base product I’ve ever used! it’s definitely lighter-medium coverage, but can easily be built up around problem areas & STILL be just as comfortable on the skin. The versatility makes it perfect for low-makeup days and natural looks. I knocked a star because it does tend to settle into my under-eye lines, but opting for a damp sponge instead of a brush could easily fix that. If you can get past the price tag, this one is definitely worth trying!"

And because of the short lid, the product flings out and multiple times landed on the floor but I kept exchanging because I thought it was worth it. The Merit foundation blending brush that goes with this however, is amazing. And works well with other products. I ended up getting Hourglass's foundation stick and it is much more creamy and works well with combination skin - I can get oily in my t-zone and dry cheeks and it still works incredibly well and you don't need a lot at all. Merit's product felt like you needed a lot to get a good blend which would just cause further pilling and streaking. If you like a thicker look in your skin, this can't handle that at all. On the other hand, as is promoted, if you want a more natural look, this doesn't achieve that because it pills so much."

I was sooo careful because I knew people complained about this happening. I always opened it very slowly, didn’t twist it up high, gently used it in every way and it still happened.

I do feel like I may have gotten the wrong shade for my skin tone, but overall, the quality of the product is really good!"

The Minimalist in Dune is the best complexion match I have ever found and for that I commend Merit. The products is super blendable and melts into the skin with minimal effort. I can't see or feel it on my skin (an issue I have with most foundations), it doesn't suck the moisture out of my skin, doesn't cake, and it mostly doesn't highlight dry spots. It truly looks and feels like skin. However, it doesn't improve the appearance of the skin, doesn't have any blurring qualities and just doesn't give that your skin but better look that other foundations and tints do (e.g., Lisa Eldridge's skin tint). For this reason, I think it's great for day-to-day but it's not something I would reach for on special occasions or if I wanted to make an impression."

The packaging and the label on the product both say shade bone. I am so confused. I wish this worked since the product seems smooth, but there is no way for me to use this. Money wasted."
