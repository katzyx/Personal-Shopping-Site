So far Iu2019m really impressed with how this one sits and blends into a very natural look.   TIP : if you have dark under eyes like me and want to cover them in one layer, apply the concealer to fully cover the dark areas and wait 2-5 mins for it to dry. Then buff it a bit and it will melt into your skin without compromising the coverage."

It has a luminous finish on me and it's 1-2-done. I use it over my regular moisturizer and a brush, under and all around the eyes, and on any needed spots. I just wish there were some olive options, but this worked okay and most brands don't have olive options anyway. I have dry skin and with just the moisturizer underneath I have had the least issues with this creasing and showing dry patches than anything else I have used. It's so creamy and satisfying too, it's like coloring over your issues with a big crayon. No smell. Hope it works for you, everyone's skin is so different, but I am very glad I tried it.

I think that this is medium coverage and you can build it to be full coverage, but I feel it would get heavy. Additionally, this is a cream product that will move on the face and transfer if you touch it. I haven't tried it with a primer yet so maybe those issues could be mitigated, but if you're a makeup minimalist and want full coverage and transfer-proof this isn't for you. Additionally, some people have reported that their product fell out shortly after use, but mine hasn't yet. I'm not that gentle with it and the base of the stick does have a small crack, but seems to have held up so far. Maybe it's because I bought it in-store so it didn't get messed up in shipping."

One of the color sticks broke during the first use & the other broke after 2 or 3 uses. These were NOT turned up (since they come sticking out enough when first opened) nor did I use the pressure of a toddler with a crayon learning to color. They just BROKE FOR NO REASON...TWICE...because I returned the first one that broke. (Didn't have the mental energy to go back for a second return so I tried to fix them on my own. A fail, btw.)   They really need to fix this as well as the packaging. With regards to the packaging, the cap is very tight which is good because that means it's not going to just fall off. However, because about half an inch of the product comes already exposed/turned up in the tube, you have to be RIDICULOUSLY CAREFUL when pulling the tight cap off because it will hit the exposed product. So you end up with nicks in the product & color all over the inside of the cap.  This costs too much money for these kinds of quality issues.  Love my Merit bronzing stick though. They should mimic that kind of packaging & set up for this foundation/concealer stick."

This comes up like just about every product claiming to be neutral -not at all neutral!  It's a very toasty apricot.   They are still lacking real, true, desaturated, almost grey neutrals and the photography is deceptive.  I could tell this was going to be orange the moment I took the cap off.  My experiment failed and this will go in the drawer with all the other non-neutral neutrals.    I wrote a review back when Merit first introduced this stick.  In it, I crunched the numbers on how this is basically the most expensive foundation stick out there, gram for gram.  If you love it, you might think it's worth it.  Otherwise, I'd probably look elsewhere.  I find the formula a tad dry on my normal-dry skin, but better (though actually more $$) than WA. You must prep very well."

Once, I took the cap off and the bullet fell out (thankfully on a clean surface, so I put it back). As I said, I swipe this all over my face, then use the Merit brush.

And because of the short lid, the product flings out and multiple times landed on the floor but I kept exchanging because I thought it was worth it. The Merit foundation blending brush that goes with this however, is amazing. And works well with other products. I ended up getting Hourglass's foundation stick and it is much more creamy and works well with combination skin - I can get oily in my t-zone and dry cheeks and it still works incredibly well and you don't need a lot at all. Merit's product felt like you needed a lot to get a good blend which would just cause further pilling and streaking. If you like a thicker look in your skin, this can't handle that at all. On the other hand, as is promoted, if you want a more natural look, this doesn't achieve that because it pills so much."

I was on vacation when I first opened it and it broke so fast like the concealer cracked in half so I couldn't really use it since it was jammed into the top and bottom. The product itself was probably okay but at that point I might as well have got the Nars if I have to dig the product out. It needs a better design with more UX development because this product is not practical the way it's intended to be used. I'm also disappointed with the dysfunctional design for it's price bracket.

It's also so easy to use. I'm not a huge makeup girly so sometimes I struggle with foundation/concealer, but this product is extremely foolproof.   I use the Merit No. 1 blending brush and it blends seamlessly onto my skin in seconds. It also lasts ALL DAY even with my oily skin and sweat.

The product applies beautifully, it is buildable, does not seem to irritate my skin, lasts reasonably well throughout the day, etc. It evens my overall tone quite well, feels like nothing, and blends easily. Taking one star off for limited shade range, It does not appear to include olive tones. I am accustomed to not seeing it in my shade range (VERY fair), but it appeared to be left out of the light, medium, and deep ranges as well. I know the line is newer, and they have expanded since their initial launch, so I understand it may be a while, but we are tired of always having to mix green into foundations!! I would also appreciate bronzer shades that didn't pull so orange on fair skin, and a contour line. preferably with a completely cool toned(like nearly grey) contour stick for us fair skinned girlies!"

I can't see or feel it on my skin (an issue I have with most foundations), it doesn't suck the moisture out of my skin, doesn't cake, and it mostly doesn't highlight dry spots. It truly looks and feels like skin. However, it doesn't improve the appearance of the skin, doesn't have any blurring qualities and just doesn't give that your skin but better look that other foundations and tints do (e.g., Lisa Eldridge's skin tint). For this reason, I think it's great for day-to-day but it's not something I would reach for on special occasions or if I wanted to make an impression."
