However, I hate that this is not fragrance free. First off, the smell is not good. Second, so many people have issues with fragrance in moisturizers and make up products in terms of allergic reactions so why are we still using them? I personally have not had any reaction. But it works so well to the point where I can ignore the smell. Hopefully one day they will make a fragrance free option."

They are easy to spot and they have no affiliated links! Influencers all start pushing the same lines at the same time because incentives for those items at the time can't be beat."

Admittedly, I hated this for a while because it always made my complexion look worse(pilling, separating, etc.) plus the fragrance is pretty strong. However, I recently found my holy grail foundation (Chanel Les Beige Complexion) and this makes it look even better! My makeup will stay looking fresh through an entire work day with a dewy, but not overly shiny, finish. I have really dry skin so I couldn't ask for better.   I would definitely recommend starting with the trial size. I tried the primer with a lot of products (including ones Beauty YouTubers recommend it with) before I found my match. Plus the scent can be very off putting... I honestly am trying to find a similar primer without fragrance, but will continue buying until then."

Just slid right off. What didn\u2019t slide off? Broke apart. This is my makeup after a 9 hour day.

This can be used as a primer under makeup, or just as a moisturizer to create a barrier against impurities. It has vitamins for nourishment, Shea Butter, and Hyaluronic Acid. My only issue with this product is that I felt the scent was a bit much while applying. It almost has a hint of citronella to me, but the scent didn\u2019t seem to last too long once it was on.

One of the things I love most about this face base is how well it absorbs into my skin. It instantly sinks in without leaving any greasy or sticky residue behind. My skin feels hydrated and smooth after application, making it the perfect canvas for makeup.  Speaking of makeup, the Bobbi Brown Face Base also doubles as a primer and boy does it do the job well. My foundation glides on effortlessly and lasts all day without any creasing or fading. It creates a flawless base for my makeup, allowing it to look airbrushed and flawless.  But the real standout feature of this product is the smell. It has a beautiful, refreshing scent that is not overwhelming or artificial. Applying it in the morning is like a mini aromatherapy session, giving me a burst of energy and starting my day off on a positive note.  I have also noticed that my skin looks brighter and more radiant since I started using the Bobbi Brown Face Base. Its formula is enriched with vitamins and antioxidants that help nourish and protect my skin. And as someone with sensitive skin, I appreciate that it is free from parabens and sulfates.  In conclusion, the Bobbi Brown Face Base has truly exceeded my expectations and I cannot imagine my skincare routine without it. It is a high-quality product that delivers on its promises and has become a must-have for me. I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a moisturizer that also works as a primer. Trust me, you won't be disappointed!"

I was SO nervous that because it had Shea Butter in it that it would be thick and greasy. I was so pleasantly surprised at how thin this formula is! You can use it day or night as just a moisturizer, or you can use it as a primer under foundation! I think it does a great job as a primer not because of filling in pores like the typical primers do, but to keep your skin moisturized and protected under the makeup. I did notice some pore blur, just not a complete fill-in. I loved this product so much! I could smell it ALL day which I personally loved - a nice, fresh, light scent!"

As someone who masks often, uses a retinoid, and experiences allergic rhinitis on a daily basis, I find that I am no stranger to flaky skin around my t-zone area (especially around my mouth), making it almost impossible for me to apply makeup due to it merely emphasizing the flaky dryness of my skin. Out of all the primers I've tried, this is the best primer at moisturizing and smoothing out the texture of my skin! (I still use a separate moisturizer underneath though.) It can sting to apply this if your skin is sensitized, so be warned, but no other primer has made my cheaper makeup look and apply so well. I feel that I don't need to use a whole lot of product to get the best result, so each jar lasts me awhile.  I recommend purchasing the trial size before committing to a full jar. My trial size has lasted me a good 2 yrs since I rarely wear makeup, but I find that when I don't use this primer, my makeup doesn't look nearly as good. Keep in mind that if your skin is peeling excessively (as in, the primer doesn't work as well at masking the flakes), consider first that you may be overexfoliating. Monitor your skincare, and this primer will treat you well."

Especially now that I am 46 and my skin is very dry due to peri menopause and this adds a glow to my skin that allows my foundation to look like skin and not sit in every pore, fine line or bit of texture. I am usually anti base product because of the typical ingredients but this has none of the bad stuff that feels like you have plastic sitting on your face. This is actually skincare feeding your skin. It plays well with both my SPF and my stick foundation that had been looking chalky and dry until this plumped up my skin and made it look healthy and feel soft. I was worried it would be too thick and not work with my spf but so far it\u2019s great.

I could definitely see a difference in how well my foundation looked on my skin. It was smoother, even after hours of wear. One of the best features of this primer is that there is no heavy or greasy feeling. My skin felt like it received an extra boost of moisture just by using this under my makeup."

The Bobbi Brown face base has been an absolute game changer. I applied the face base, let it soak in for about minutes and then applied my foundation. I was shocked at how smooth and even my foundation looked. At the end of the night, my face looked slightly oily but still much better than any other primer I\u2019ve tried.

Sometimes it\u2019s hard for me to find a primer that works with my moisturizer and foundation. This primer takes away the need for moisturizer. The ingredients are way beyond what I expected: Vitamin B, C and E, hyaluronic acid, squalane and shea butter. This works very well with my foundation.   I have dry/combination skin and this helps me to have a dewy look all day without being oily. The texture is on the thicker side, but I rub my finger across the product and it almost melts on my finger, then I apply. I like the light lemon scent.   \ud83d\udeabparabens \ud83d\udeabphthalates \ud83d\udeabsulfates \ud83d\udeabanimal-derived products \ud83d\udeabgluten"

However, this base has become a very good care product for me and I use it solo.  It spreads perfectly over the skin and does not leave any stickiness or oiliness.  Absorbs within 5-7 minutes.

This is a thick luxurious cream that leaves the skin super hydrated and prepped for a flawless makeup application. I wouldn\u2019t recommend it for oilier skins because it might be a bit too thick and glowy in my opinion but for dry skin it is very much worth the hype! The price is a bit steep but a little does go a long way and the luxurious heavy glass packaging is an experience in itself."
