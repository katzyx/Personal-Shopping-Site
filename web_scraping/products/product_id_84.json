My skin literally always feels more hydrated, tighter, and brighter! It’s my favorite skincare tool of anything I’ve used. Regardless of the skincare products you use, this tool maximizes the value of those products simply by improving the absorption into your skin! I cannot recommend this product enough - even for the girlies that were blessed with beautiful skin and keep the routine simple! It will STILL make a difference in your skin, promise. 10/10 highly recommend!"
