			"review_text": "I really like the formula of this shadow, and the color and pigmentation are there for me, but I just can't get behind the packaging. An eyeshadow stick has to be easy to use on the eyes, and this is shaped like a straight up lipstick. I used to by just rubbing a brush or my finger directly on the product and then applying it to my face, but I feel like that defeats the purpose behind a product like this. It works better when applied with fingers, by the way. Other than the actual packaging and user experience' side of things, I think it's a good product. I used it as a glitzy highlight on my cheeks too and got lots of compliments."

You won't get shimmers that go all over your face.  The only drawback (which is why I deducted a point) is it's a bit difficult to apply but I attribute this to the shape of my eyelid.  I tried to use the eyeshadow directly, using a brush and also using my fingers."

Although I would like for it to be a long lasting all day type of eye shadow stick it doesn't hold up all day but it holds up long enough so if you were to go out or needing for a special occasion. I love the  Lipstick like applicator and the packaging is so beautiful as well the only thing is that a lot of product comes out at once so I will just be really careful of that."

My preferred method is straight from the tube to the eyelid as it is the least messy. When I used my finger to apply it I got tiny little pieces of glitter everywhere and had a hard time removing them. The brush would be my second preferred method but can take a while to build the opacity. I also like that you can use a small dap for a very light ethereal look like the picture or you can build it and get an intense metallic glitter finish. The product is VERY soft so apply light pressure and only twist a small amount up out of the tube or else it will smoosh and break."

This item is the perfect size to take with you on a trip or to keep in your purse. It is very light and cute packaging and easy to hold when applying the makeup on. I absolutely love the color and the formula of this item. I have worn it multiple times in different temperatures and it lasted all day and night long. In very hot temperatures even without eyeshadow primer the eyeshadow stayed on and didn‚Äôt look oily. It was amazing and really gives your eyes a pop! My only disappointment with the item is that it is hard to use the stick to apply it to your eyes. You have to use a brush or your fingers. It is very quick to apply/blend and you don‚Äôt need a lot of product to make the color stand out! Since it is a long lasting and smooth eyeshadow I can get over the fact I have to apply it with my fingers. I have received many compliments and feel great with this eyeshadow stick. Definitely my go to color when I go out. If you don‚Äôt mind having to apply using a brush or your fingers I highly recommend this product for its smooth, long lasting wear and beautiful color!"

I prefer color with a neutral undertone (on occasion with a cool undertone) in mid to deep shades. Eyeshadows in mid to deep blues, purples (not plum), greens, browns and greys. Lippies in brown with purple (not plum) undertone, vampy reds, muted purples and deep mauve and berries.  I was excited about this eyeshadow. I envisioned a beautiful metallic or foil. Instead I was met with intense glitter, not shimmer. I selected Flash Storm because it appeared neutral and cool in the swatches, but it shows up peachy/orange on my skin. Not a fan of the color or the glitter. I don't believe it will last all day with how easily I was able to smudge it after taking photos.  The rebrand is giving 80s goth vibes. Overall not a fan of this new KVD. I miss the OG. I'm sure the clean beauty crowd will love it, but that's not me.

			"review_text": "This stick eyeshadow features a finish that stands out due to its high concentration of glitter, which can feel heavy for some users, especially due to its overly light color base. Because of this, I prefer applying it as a topper to prevent the glitter from transferring onto the rest of the makeup and clothing throughout the day, even after using a fixative, or alternatively, I prefer a light layer that adds a subtle touch of shimmer without being too flashy. I'm not a fan of applying this type of particles near the eyes.  Regarding application, it's possible to layer the product without it becoming patchy, but since it consists mainly of glitter layers, I opt for a discreet application. I believe the composition could be improved by selecting more appealing glitters and adding a bit more color. Additionally, I think it would be beneficial to replace ingredients like Phenoxyethanol and PEG to prevent eye irritations, something I've experienced with this product.  I like the lipstick-style packaging presentation, although I find the product to be too soft and prone to deformation with use, which affects the application experience."

This eyeshadow is called Dazzle Stick and I received the color Flash Storm 30, 3.5g size. This product is full of multidimensional shimmering flecks that is sure to turn heads. This stick eyeshadow has an aluminum design with a refreshing water based formula. Be cautious when applying though because it glides on fast and slightly wet but quickly dries to create a smooth finish. Unfortunately, due to this formula being water based, my oily eyelids weren‚Äôt the best canvas for this product. After a few hours of wear, I saw some transfer to my upper lids. For that reason, this eyeshadow was not for me."

			"review_text": "The texture of this shadow stick is very soft, almost gel-like, so I have found that it takes a bit of care to apply. If you apply it directly from the shadow stick onto the eye, the color appears more pigmented, and it provides a metallic finish. I have found that this is not my favorite method because it can clump a little, and I prefer a glitter finish rather than a metallic one. I like to apply this product by tapping it onto my eyelids with my finger instead. This method makes it look more like an eyeshadow topper, and it provides a beautiful dusting of glitter. I have the color hail surge and by applying it this way, the base appears clear, and you are left with a beautiful multidimensional rose gold glitter. It is stunning when it hits the light. The first time I swatched it on my hand, I kept finding myself admiring it throughout the day every time the light hit it. I haven't had any issues with creasing, but again I am not applying it in a thick layer across my lid. I was a little disappointed with the component as it feels a bit light in the hand, but that is just my personal preference. Overall this product in the shade hail surge is stunning as an eyeshadow topper rather than a one and done shadow, and I would recommend it to those looking for a glitter topper that is easy to apply and wears nicely throughout the day."

I got it in the color Flash Storm. The pigment is like a brownish color so I paired it with a little darker brown on the edge of my makeup. It‚Äôs so pretty for a top coat as well. I am in absolute awe over this eyeshadow stick! Super beautiful color, the pigment is definitely there! It stayed on all day and night. Was super easy to take off as well. It didn‚Äôt crease or move at all. Definitely worth it! Will be getting the other colors as well."

It is very sparkly, and you can control how much pigment you want by adding more or less of the product (and spreading more or less of it). For day use, I love to put just a little bit and spread it around, adding a bit of sparkle to the eye lids. For night / special occasions use, then I can go a bit more intense on the stroke to achieve a bolder look. Format is convenient and package is easy to keep it closed and ready to use at anytime."

Although way too much dazzle (glitter) for my taste, if you‚Äôre looking to add sparkle to your eye lids - this is the product for you. This product will make the perfect topper, I would use this very sparingly, as it has very intense color payoff.   As far as long wearing, it washes off pretty easily compared to other similar products that have more staying power. I would recommend using a good eyeshadow primer with the this product to increase longevity and prevent from creasing (especially for my oily/combination skin ladies). The texture is creamy and easy to blend and build - the color Flash Storm is a warm taupe with silver specks of glitter, will complement a neutral eye very well. The packaging is sleek and convenient. In my opinion, this is not a ‚Äúuse everyday‚Äù type of product - this product, for me, is for a very specific and dramatic look."

The creamy formula glides on smoothly without any tugging, making it easy to achieve your precise look even when you're in a hurry. I like the way the product blends; you can easily diffuse it for a more subtle look or create a bold, vibrant effect. One of the standout features is the long-lasting formula. True to its claims, the eyeshadow lasted all day without creasing or fading, even on my oily eyelids. This makes it perfect for long days or nights out when I don't want to worry about touching up again. Another big plus is that it's vegan and cruelty-free, in line with KVD Beauty's commitment to ethical beauty. It's always rewarding to find high-performing products that are also animal and environmentally friendly. KVD Beauty Dazzle Vegan Long Wear Eyeshadow Stick in Electro Bolt is a great addition to my makeup collection. It is easy to use, gives great results and stays beautiful all day long.

I love the champagne shimmer to it, it's very illuminating for the ball of the eyelid and the inner corner. The shimmer can get a little chunky which I didn't care for, but so long as it's applied without a heavy hand its ok.  It's a very soft formula so it's easy to squish it over the sides of the applicator if it happens to be switched too far up. Not really a big deal but definitely something to note.  The wear on this is decent for a stick shadow. I have pretty oily kids and I was expecting this to crease like crazy and it didn't crease at all. It stayed exactly where I put it.  The packaging is very nice quality and really makes it feel like thought was put into it to make it look and feel like a good quality product."

The consistency feels cooling as you apply the cream to your eyes, and dries out fairly quickly for it to be a bit easier to work with! Keep in mind a little goes a long way, and you barely need to twist the product up to get a really decent amount to work with! I overall really recommend this! so sparkly and beautiful."

I was actually a little surprised because I've only used a couple other eyeshadow sticks and they didn't work well for me but this one, not only is it beautiful, it doesn't crease and it stays in place for ever! It lasts all day no smearing or smudging or creasing, and I have hooded eyes so the no creasing is a big deal for me. It's very pigmented and smooth. It feels cold on the skin almost wet when applying but it's more of a soft cream formula. It's an interesting texture. After applying you need to blend fast because it drys down fast. I'd recommend doing one eye at a time, but it does blend nicely as long as you do it quickly. After it sets, that's it. It's not coming off until you wash it off. Even the glitter stays in place with the exception of one or two strays from blending. It really is beautiful I got the shade flash storm 30, it's a medium/light neutral brown filled with green, blue, copper, and silver shifting sparkles. I'm very interested to see what other shades they have and I plan on buying a couple of I see some colors I like. I would highly recommend this eyeshadow stick it's fantastic!"

As someone who loves vibrant, long-lasting eye makeup, this eyeshadow stick truly impresses with its performance and ease of use. One of the standout features of this eyeshadow stick is its intense pigmentation. The color payoff is exceptional, delivering rich, vibrant hues with just one swipe. The shade range is stunning, with a variety of colors that include both bold and neutral options, making it easy to find the perfect shade for any look. The Dazzle Long Wear Eyeshadow Stick is incredibly easy to apply. The creamy formula glides effortlessly across the eyelids, allowing for smooth and even application. Whether I'm creating a quick, everyday look or a more dramatic, smoky eye, this eyeshadow stick makes the process quick and hassle-free. Another fantastic aspect is its long-lasting wear. Once applied, the eyeshadow stays put throughout the day without creasing, smudging, or fading. This is particularly impressive given its creamy texture, as many similar products tend to crease over time. With this eyeshadow stick, I can confidently wear it from morning to night without needing touch-ups. The built-in sharpener is a thoughtful addition, ensuring that the stick maintains a precise tip for detailed application. This is especially useful for creating defined lines or more intricate eye makeup looks."

Either way, it's fairly easy to work with except it's a bit too soft at times and will leave a streak on your eyelid. Overall, it does set down, but I wouldn't rub your eyes or anything. I find the glitter and the colors kinda interfered with each other, doing neither thing particularly well for my preference though."

The formula is soft, so you don‚Äôt have to press hard or swipe repeatedly to get a smooth, pigmented deposit of color that blends easily. It has a nice cooling effect on the lids as you swipe it on your skin, which will be nice in the summer months. Once it sets, the shadow lasts all day without creasing or the glitter migrating across the face. It‚Äôs a new favorite!"

It appears to look like lipstick, so it was a bit awkward to apply to my eyes - so that‚Äôs why I‚Äôd give it 4 stars instead of 5. I live in Florida, so I was worried it‚Äôd smear due to the humidity, but it didn‚Äôt which I was happy about. It blended in well when I wiped it, and I got compliments on my makeup by friends when I wore it.

I did not read the instructions on how to apply it; I thought it was going to be simple, so l applied it straight onto the eyelid, but that was my mistake. Next time I'll more than likely just use my finger to apply this. Apart from that mishap, the shade is very shiny and pretty‚Äî more of a white once on. With how vibrant it is, it would look really good in the summer. I've worn it for half a day now, and throughout the day it has been a bit warm- usually with these types of eyeshadows, they tend to look weird and uneven after a while on my hooded eyes, but I haven't had any sort of issues regarding that while having this on."

It is really delicate and will crumble off a little if you aren't careful. This is one of the best eyeshadow sticks I've used so would certainly consider again."

This is a huge plus since I dont like the click pencils that don't seem to want to go back into their tube. So this eyeshadow pencil will be easy to use and one of my favorite forsure and I know I can take care of it well since it will retract back into its tube and the lid seems to stay put. So, no accidents of it popping off in my purse and making a mess."

			"review_text": "I recently received the KVD Beauty Dazzle Long-Wear Eyeshadow Stick in Flash Storm complimentary through Influenster for my honest review, and it has truly impressed me with its performance and convenience.  First and foremost, the application is a dream. The stick glides smoothly over the eyelids, delivering a stunning, highly pigmented color with ease. The compact design makes it perfect for on-the-go touch-ups, fitting effortlessly into even the smallest of makeup bags.  The longevity of this eyeshadow stick is remarkable. It lasts all day without fading or creasing, maintaining its dazzling brilliance from morning until night. Additionally, its smudge-proof formula ensures that your eye makeup stays flawless, even through long hours and humid conditions.  The color Flash Storm is absolutely beautiful, adding a touch of glamour to any look. It's versatile enough for both daytime elegance and nighttime drama, making it a great addition to any makeup collection.  However, I must mention that the safety rating for this product is 49/100. This is due to some low-risk ingredients and the presence of Phenoxyethanol, a moderate-risk ingredient that can be an endocrine disruptor and may cause allergic reactions. While this didn't personally affect me, it's important for potential users to be aware of these factors, especially if they have sensitive skin or specific ingredient concerns.  Overall, despite the safety rating, I am very pleased with the KVD Beauty Dazzle Long-Wear Eyeshadow Stick. Its long-lasting wear, ease of application, and stunning color make it a standout product in my makeup routine. If you're looking for an eyeshadow that delivers on performance and beauty, this is definitely worth considering."

At certain angles some of the mauve shimmers flash and turn teal. This looks nice as they are complimentary colors. The shimmers themselves under normal lights are gorgeous on their own. There is a lot going on in this shadow that the camera doesn‚Äôt even pick up. A static photo does not do it justice. The product itself feels a little cold when applied. You have a chance to blend it and then it dries down. I recommend doing one eye at a time. I used a matte mauve in the crease to pull the look together. The only thing that‚Äôs a little annoying is the shadow is pretty soft. I‚Äôd be afraid to use it with too much rolled out in fear it‚Äôll just mush around and not be a stick anymore. I just roll out a little at a time so it‚Äôs not a big deal. As far as longevity goes, it‚Äôs pretty budge proof once it dries. I can smear around some of the glitter but the color stays put which is the important part. I would be interested to try the other shades of this product."

Usually glitters come in a pot and I have to dip my finger in. Here I swipe it on my lids and I get instant color pay off. Also it strangely cool to the touch and feels kind of cold on your eyelid. The color is very opaque and then you get a scattering of a ton of glitter. The glitter here is so sophisticated and beautiful. You get little specks of blue and purple, but it‚Äôs still very sophisticated, the picture does not do it justice. Super easy to apply, I just wipe it on my lid and then smudge out the edges with either a brush or my finger. The lasting power is excellent. I haven‚Äôt tried anything else from the brand but this product is so good that I would like to.

A finger is the best way to apply for maximum pigmentation. However, if you apply too much it will look a little crispy on the eyes but since it's highly pigmented and you don't need much, you won't need to layer it on or anything. Once it's dry it will not move and you don't have any playtime with it once it's set so work on one eye at a time.   I will say though, if you leave the product around without using it too often, the very top of it might dry slightly (even if the cap is on properly) but a few swipes with your finger will warm it put and it should be fine. Just something to note."

I apply a similarly colored satin/matte shade as a transition color first in my crease and then use this over the lid itself. I find its easier to tap it on directly from the tube for more payoff. I do not twist the tube to expose a lot of product though- only the tiniest amount that I need, and then I gently tap to my lid and blend with a fingertip as needed. It's a very soft product and I would be nervous about twisting the bullet too much and either breaking some off.   The cooling sensation is not necessary for me to love it, but is a nice bonus. This is a great addition to my single shadow drawer/collection!"

You have to have the lightest hand because they‚Äôre so soft they‚Äôll smush if you press too hard. If you apply too much it will get a bit clumpy and patchy. I swatched on the back of my hand a few times to figure out the right pressure and amount to apply. For me they wore well and the shimmer is super intense which is what I was looking for. Electro Bolt is a copper shade with light green shimmer, which sounds weird but is surprisingly pretty and the contrast makes the shimmer stand out and look beaming. Lightning Strike is a bronze with gold shimmer and is beautifulllllllll on deep skin."

I was going to buy the Laura Mercier Caviar Stick, but I discovered the KVD Dazzle Stick and decided to try that instead. Here's the rundown:  Pros: - a lot of product in the little tube - the colour is beautiful - the teensiest bit of product is enough to cover an entire eyelid - easiy to blend  Cons: - the color is VERY bright and vivid (ie. not for everyday wear) - the product is super soft, the slightest bit of pressure will cause the shadow to mush down or break off - the glitter gets everywhere and won't come off unless you scrub your entire face - the copper shade leans more gold than copper  I really want to love this, and if I had parties or events to go to, I would definitely get some use out of it. But since my life only consists of zoom calls and going to work, I need something a lot more toned down."

Works great on a bare lid, over a cream shadow base or over a powder shadow. I don't know what witchcraft this is but it does not crease on my hooded oily lids. It is a soft creamy formula so make sure to only roll up the product until it is level with the edges of the tube, that way you can apply pressure without shmushing it and wasting product. I have also barely seen any fall out from this! would definitely recommend :)"

I am in love, it is creamy and leaves the perfect amount of glitter for a fun eye look. I use my finger instead of straight from the stick and its easier to control how much you apply that way. Highly recommend!"

The swatches from KVD make these look like just another opaque glitter eye product that you have in palettes 1000 times over, BUT they are so special in person. If I were to use the stick directly on my eyes the finish would probably look like the photos, but if applied with a finger they are a brilliant wash of fine glitter with just the tiniest hint of pigment. They make my eyes sparkle in such a magical fairy way. Think less loose glitter & more TF topper shade. These are STUNNING! Formula is has great wear time & doesn‚Äôt lose impact as the day goes on. Got one shade in my Trendmood box & def grabbing more. Winning product from KVD, highly recommend if you like sparkle."

Straight from the stick is... difficult, but I didn‚Äôt get as good of an application with my finger and forget using a brush. It‚Äôs easy to apply too heavy, but once you do get the hang of it it‚Äôs worth it. If you do build this up or apply heavily, you will get minimal creasing. I‚Äôm still trying to get the application down... I‚Äôve only worn this a few time since purchasing. The consistency is refreshing, but also works against you with application. It‚Äôs creamy/jelly consistency dries quickly and makes the product difficult to work with, but like I said, there‚Äôs a learning curve with it."

I haven't purchased anything from the brand in the last couple of years due to all of the chaos and drama that it has gone through and quite honestly, nothing has really appealed to me. when I saw some swatches of these shadow sticks, though, I was curious so I splurged and purchased just one. It's gorgeous. It can be applied straight from the stick onto the eyelid but I find that it's easier to get a more precise application if I apply the product onto my finger and then onto my lid. The result is fabulous. It's very opaque  without having to build it up, I don't get any creasing throughout the day, no fallout whatsoever, and it still looks really good up until I'm ready to remove it before I go to bed. I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5 simply because it is expensive for a single eyeshadow but that being said, it's very lovely and I wouldn't mind picking up another shade."

I've not tried the caviar sticks because that brand is not cruelty free. Another reviewer compared this to the Hourglass scattered light, which I also love, but this stick is bolder color than Hourglass's. I'm going to pick up another color!"

You can use just the stick or what I did was put some on my lid then used my finger (again- I‚Äôm not a professional lol).  I didn‚Äôt find there to be any fall out. As long as you‚Äôre not putting a huge chunk on your lid, which you won‚Äôt need since these are so pigmented, you should be fine in regards to it not getting all over your face.  It lasted all night! I also find the packaging to be convenient for traveling as well as just overall good.  I have four shades and honestly will probably end up getting the rest. Perfect for fall/winter!"
