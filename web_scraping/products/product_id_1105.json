I actually didnu2019t think it would as it pulled orange on me (as most colors do) in the shop. In more natural light it appears as a deep neutral red. The formula is fantastic. Itu2019s neither drying or moisturizing and it feels like itu2019s not even there. Even though itu2019s a dark red-brown it stays put and doesnu2019t migrate around my lips. I can wear it without liner for this reason. I highly recommend this lipstick, especially for the price. It compares favorably to more expensive brands. Very luxurious."

Quite a disappointment on longevity after trying their matte formula lipstick because their matte formula really lasts.

I applied it like 3 times and it doesn't show up at all. I found that really strange. I know Merit is supposed to be clean and sheer coverage, but these products are too costly to not even show up! Sadly I will have to be returning this shade. The packaging is nice, and it goes on super smooth, but I need SOME color payoff. I would only wear this if I wanted a bare bones no make-up make-up look."

I want to say that for starters I have a true medium complexion and due to the formula of this lipstick, the shade comes up lighter on you. What you see in the tube is not what you get on your lips and that actually makes me happy in this instance. It swatches to this sheer, beautiful natural brown... almost like the brown version of your lips but better. It's neutral which is a huge plus and in my case, lip liner was not needed. I also purchased the shade Baby and I am also in love with that shade. Baby is a bit light on me, but honestly it's not an issue. It doesn't wash me out, but it does look amazing when I use a light brown neutral lip liner. For reference, I used Nyx Nutmeg lip liner and it worked perfectly, so think along those lines if  you need a good liner with the shade Baby. I definitely recommend these lipsticks if you're looking for a good wash of color and want something moisturizing and light weight. These will now be my go to work lipsticks since I prefer glosses, lip butters and moisturizing lipsticks for work so I can just keep them in my pocket to reapply during a busy shift."

On first swipe it goes on quite sheer, but a few more swipes and you can build it up to the deepness you want without it feeling excessive. A win! I call this the perfect make-out lipstick because it doesn't have that annoying chalky base that dries up or bleeds. It's more balm-like and very hydrating, but not too slippy. It stays put without drying out. It's so goof-proof you can apply it without a mirror. The way it looks and feels, incredible. This is SO worth the price, and my dream brown lipstick that can be sheer-subtle or deeper depending on your mood. So it's actually a few lipsticks in one: the balm, the sheer barely there brown, the dark and sexy, and it's not going to ball up and look weird on your lips after eating, drinking, or kissing. A must have in dryer climates or on a kissing date. Get it, I wouldn't even bother with the lighter brown one Slip because you can get a light tone out of this, but also the benefit of a darker color in one. Win-win! LOVE IT!"

My sister is a redhead with more yellow/olive undertones and this is her favorite lip as well. I understand those who think this isn't worth it, at first pass this may seem like too little bang for your buck - but I have tried SO MANY light lipsticks, searching for a browny nude shade that is flattering for someone with my undertone and I've *never* had luck; browns are always too orange or pink or vampy. This cool brown is a true taupe/earthy tone and it looks good on every single person in my life."

It blends into my skin, giving me the look of concealer lips. The formula on the lips was alright, but you can find equivalents at much more affordable price points. Because of the slip of this product, it broke at the base after 2 uses - it does not hold up well against warm weather either. I might try a different, bolder color some time in the future to give it a second chance, but for now I am not impressed."

The formula is so comfortable to wear, easy to reapply even without a mirror, and the colors are really flattering on my pale neutral olive skin. I also find they work really nicely as a cream blush! I hope to see them release additional shades in the future, but I really don't see myself buying any other lipstick formula now that I have this one. I haven't had any of the colors break or become loose in the tube, so I think maybe that's a user error issue? Or I've just been really lucky with the ones I've gotten."

I havenu2019t had any issues with it breaking but I am fairly gentle with my products. This is a very slippy, soft formula that creates a worn-in but moisturised look. It feels nice but it does bleed, which is why I donu2019t think this formula will suit you if you prefer a crisp look. I havenu2019t tried this lipstick with liner, but I do wear it to my office job and it does well with a put together look as well as a casual one, which is why I like it. This isnu2019t like a Mac formula, for example, because itu2019s sheer and the therefore you can wear it lightly for a sheer wash or build it up. But again, it does bleed and needs fairly frequent reapplying but I donu2019t mind that since it doesnu2019t dry out my lips like many lipsticks do.   1990 is a bit darker than Iu2019d like for my skin tone, so Iu2019ll be using it as a fall/winter shade while I think Cabo is more complementary for a fair skin tone and can work year round. I do recommend swatching in store before you buy. I highly recommend it if you donu2019t mind this specific type of formula!"

I had been eyeing these and grabbed them during the sale. So pleased i did. there are a few oter shades i may try in the future. These shades I bought, I would definately repurchase. Highly recommend to someone new to lipstick because the formula is so buildable. Even the darker shades are vdery wearable and less intimidating on the lip than in the bullet. And i forget to mention that I love the packaging. I love the Merit packaging esthetic in general, and these are awesome. I love how you can display with the shade visible.

I find it doesn't cling to any dry patches on my lips, and it doesn't emphasize the fine lines on my lips. I have dozens of lipsticks on my top shelf and find I'm always reaching for this. It's such a great formula that feels incredible, doesn't dry out my lips, and is the perfect shade for my cool toned skin. I'm usually skeptical of clean beauty brands since they tend to expire really quickly, so I was kinda biased against this product but it's been a favourite for months now! Definitely recommend."

I got Tiger, loved it all season for a wintry brick, just got Cabo for a springy warm red. I prefer warm-based lip colors, which are tough to find - and this whole line delivers. Beware if you don't like warm tones. I love that you can wear these colors sheer, like a tinted balm, or at a juicy near-full opacity. The formula is also very hydrating for me. No cracking or flaking after wear. In fact, the morning after a night out in this lipstick, my lips feel distinctly soft. This has become my everyday lipstick."

It has a satin finish with a bit of a gleam to it on the lips. I don't find the formula as moisturizing as some seem to, but it isn't drying either -- kind of like goldilocks in that respect.  I love this shade, which on me is much more berry than brown, more like a bright burgundy, and bolder than I expected. In my collection of favorite berry-brown lipsticks (Huda Habibi, Pat McGrath Flesh 7, Lisa Eldridge Painterly, Fenty Slip Shine Cookies & Cocoa) this one leans the most berry and has the brightest, boldest color. The bullet feels sturdy and I enjoy the paddle-like shape. The color has very good longevity too. Definitely a win for me and I would like to try some of the other shades (1990, Millenial) eventually."

I saw the shade in an advertisement and I am a sucker for a fleshy pink/brown shade. Iu2019m headlong for 60, and at my age, neutral is better. It also means I am concerned about the condition of my skin. This lipstick stays put for long enough to make me WANT to put more on. Itu2019s buildable. I like to swish it and brush it and perfect the shape of my lips when I go out. I just put one pass of it on each lip on Sundays when I just donu2019t feel like making up.

Also, the pictures online are NOT ACCURATE at all. I have light, very warm-toned skin, and am colour analyzed as a true spring. I bought Fashion, Cabo, and Tiger. Fashion pulls too cool-toned and purple on me and darkens my brightness / natural glow. It's not a soft berry as descripted and leans more plum-pink. Although a warmer a shade, Tiger is very brown IRL and also darkens my brightness. There is no trace of red on me. Cabo is perfect though -- a bright red orange.  Merit, please make more shades."

I have a thinner upper lip and a more fuller lower lip, so I find that red lipstick accentuates that, which is not a look that I really enjoy. I also find that red lipstick makes any discoloration on my face more prominent and noticeable. I have tried several different brands, like CT, Mac, NARS, Urban Decay, Dior, etc. I find them all disappoint me, either too drying or not enough pigment or too much pigment. Merit's Tiger was the entire package for me. It is as hydrating as a lip balm, and the colour is so beautiful. I can layer it without it looking thick and streaky. It really pulls together my look as well - I have dark brown hair and dark hazel eyes, so it completes my aesthetic. It will be my go-to lip product for fall and winter. Definitely give it a try. I will be getting Baby and Cabo next."

The two shades I bought, Tiger and Lu2019Avenue, are much browner than they appear here. If I just saw Tiger Iu2019d never think to refer to it as a red. It looks straight up like a rusty warm brown to me. Similarly, Lu2019Avenue hardly looks berry at all to me. I was hoping for something a bit brightened like Black Honey, but again this pulls very very brown and also quite deep. I think these are good if youu2019re going for a 90s look, but I like a bit of brightness to my lip shades to brighten up the complexion and these are lacking in that. Itu2019s a bummer because I hate returning used products!"

It is almost the same color as my lips - almost.  But it is a hair lighter - not too light though!  It doesn't give concealer lips and it actually leans more on the cool-toned side than an actual neutral which is what I love about it!  It's the perfect lip to wear with a bold eye look or smokey eye.  The formula is phenomenal.  Easy to wear and has a satin finish but doesn't wear off too quickly.  But when it does wear off it does so with grace.  I also have the shade 1990 and that is another favorite lip color - if you are afraid that it will be too deep (on lighter skintones) - it won't be.  It can be applied with a sheer color with just a couple swipes or built up, but it never gets too dark.  The only issue is that these lipsticks tend to break easily!  The warmth from being in your pocket can be enough to have it break.  And definitely don't leave it in your car on a warm day.  I have broken 2 of the 1990 lipsticks so far.  But the formula and these colors are so nuanced that it is worth it and they still get 5 stars!  Try shade Baby before it goes out of stock again!   ...  P.S. I have Dior lipsticks.. Givenchy... Gucci... as well as Milani, Loreal, Maybelline... Mac, Makeup By Mario, and the list goes on.  THESE lipsticks are my favorite formula."

I do wish they were a bit longer lasting but they're vert moisturizing so i guess that makes it hard to achieve. I would describe it more as a very tinted lil balm but i don't really mind it, makes it a great everyday lipstick for when you don't wanna wear alot of makeup."

Also if you have naturally pigmented lips these will probably translate differently on you than someone with light colored lips like me. I was worried 1990 would be too dark because it is described as dark brown. In the tube yeah but on the lips it's not too dark on my fair skin. I most usually don't think you have to pay high prices for lipstick (except luxury brands usually nail down those murky, unusual shades) but this is very worth the price.

Baby is more brown/purple color, and Millennial is more of a coral/brick-red color. I'll be keeping Baby and making it work, and giving Millennial to a friend with warm undertones that looks stunning in it."

The color doesn't get bunched up in my lip wrinkles too badly, lasts forever, and I can build it up from sheer to kinda vampy with a couple of layers. I'm glad L'Avenue was one of the few left in stock, because the color is SPOT-ON. I haven't liked a traditional bullet lipstick this much in years!"

            "review_text": "First thing I want to say is the packing is STUNNING and makes this lipstick feel much more expensive than it is. It is satisfyingly heavy in the hand but not bulky. The colored acrylic lid looks much nicer to me than just clear acrylic and they style of the case is just not something you see often which definitely makes this feel special and unique. Now on to the colors, feel and wear. I have 2 colors: Slip and Baby.  Slip is a lovely neutral leaning warm soft brown. Because of the formula and how thin it is, I can get the desired opacity without going overboard. I have light to light-med neutral/warm olive undertones with very pigmented lips which means browns, especially ones with a very heavy white base come off odd looking and too stark. Even with lip liner you can still see where my lip color is around the edges and it makes them look sickly or like there is a rash. Because this formula starts very sheer and can be built easily, I don't have that issue. And it's emollient so there isn't a lot of tug when applying and doesn't feel heavy when you build it up. And growing up in the late 90s/early 00s, it lets me relive that love of brown-neutral lips. It very much reminds me of  the long discontinued Bonne Bell lip gloss in Cappuccino, just warmer and thinner. Baby is a neutral pink with some beautiful dusty rose mixed in. After some swatching and comparing, it isn't EXACT as Merit is a bit deeper and the finish isn't matte, it is a very close dupe to CT Pillow Talk. And while I love CT, it is a heavier formula and a matte finish which has its time and place but I'm finding I prefer shiny, glossy, hydrating lip products more than anything that is matte. You definitely do not need both but I am not mad I have them both. I did deduct 1 star because Slip is not staying upright in the bullet. I'm not sure if it is due to melting a bit in transit or just the softness of the shade, but it is frustrating. Gonna try letting it fully set in the freezer and hope that helps"

Because two of the three colors I bought, 1990 and Slip, have broken inside their packaging. I have been an avid lipstick wearer for years, and this has never happened to me. Perhaps it's due to the balmy nature of the lipstick. However, that then defeats the purpose of something you can reapply on the go. The packaging is beautiful and sturdy. Apparently, the lipstick bullet itself it not. It is really, really a shame, as the formula and the colors are unique and beautiful. Maybe I just had bad luck."

Itu2019s a true dusty pinkish (emphasis on the u201cishu201d) nude, it goes on smoothly and doesnu2019t feel drying. Staying power could be better but I like that itu2019s balmy and subtle, but buildable. I prefer products that are more translucent. This is not an opaque lipsticku2014but it isnu2019t supposed to be.   Baby is great for everyday, and when you want to make an eyeshadow look the center.   90s: itu2019s brownish! I like it. Not sure what else to say! It doesnu2019t run too cool imo, so thereu2019s not a risk of looking gray-ish. But not too dark on me, and works for a neutral look. Itu2019s buildable, too, but starts off sheer (a plus in my book). Good for a little bit of an edgy vibe.   Lu2019avenue: reminds me a bit of an old urban decay shade called bruise, but this one is more muted and brown-based (bruise was more berry). This one is to me a more mature, classic shade (versus the urban decay anyway), which I love. Subtle yet distinctive. Great for eveningsu2014though each of these shades could really work for any occasion, I tried to capture what I think the u201cvibeu201d felt like.   Main pros: wearable, buildable, versatile shades. Love the colors in this collection. Fresh yet classic!!!, balmy/not drying, comfortable, and did I mention it has beautiful packagingu2026so gorgeous.   Main cons: not long lasting"

It's sheer and buildable but really covers your lips nicely for a sensual lucious look and feel to your lips.   I find a lot of sheer lip colours to feel a bit more like an oil, so when outlining your lips it creates streaks of colour. Merit Signature Lip is the opposite.   This formula is sheer but covers your entire lip with even colour. Lasts long and is relatively hydrating.  i have dark brown features and fair-warm skin and Slip is the perfect every-day look that has that light tone that matches warm tone makeup."

It is a bit on the sheer side so if you want a full opacity lip color this may not be for you but I find I can get great coverage with this lipstick.

Packaging is beautiful and feels expensive. Would recommend this formula and lipstick!"

The shade and finish are exactly the same swatched beside each other except when on the lips, the Merit feels lighter and more comfortable and is longer lasting than the Charlotte Tilbury.  PLUS, the price point is WAY BETTER with the Merit.  You get more than double the product for $7 CAD LESS than the Charlotte Tilbury.  Highly recommend this formula of lipstick for those who don't normally like wearing bullet lipsticks.  This formula is truly special."

But my beautiful lipstick is SO fragile. I don't even want to use it anymore because I'm scared the product will completely fall out. The third or fourth time I used it, it felt like it was moving a bit, even though I was quite gentle. I have a few other lipsticks from other brands like Nars (even some drugstore lipsticks) and I have never had this problem. If this lipstick did not move around and smudge the wall of the tube I would give it 5 stars. I am in love with everything about it, the formula, the scent, the packaging, and especially the colour. I'm not sure what to do because I can't even return it for a new one. I waited a couple of weeks to try it out and then I only wore it a few times since getting it, so it's past the return date. I saw one other review saying something similar so maybe it's a bad batch? I don't know. I am considering using a lip brush but it just makes things more complicated. I want to be able to just throw this in my bag and go somewhere. Also, I should mention, that I never had it in any kind of heated area or sunlight. I keep it in my drawer and my room is on the cooler side. Does anyone know if there's a way to fix this? Is this happening to others as well or just me and that one other person? I really wanted to buy another colour but if it's going to be the same then I won't."

Frankly if I would have seen it in person before buying it I wouldn't have bought it at all. Millennial is supposed to be a classic pink but it's actually a medium warm rose, nothing close as described or shone in the pictures. It's not a bad color, but it's not what I'm looking for. I tried it out anyway because I heard good things about the formula and the formula is lovely, very reminiscent of the Crushed Lip Colors. My lips can get pretty dry and textured because I have pernicious anemia. It made my lips feel dry but not as much as other lipsticks have and the pigment didn't sink into lines or emphasize dry patches and it feels nice to put on. If they ever come out with more colors and stock them in the store I'll definitely consider trying it again, but from the 3 I was able to see in person and the one I ordered they all lean very warm and rusty or rosy. If you can, swatch them in store first!"

The formula feels like literal silk, absolutely divine. They weren't kidding about the weightless part, it's seriously wild.   The shade Baby is a p e r f e c t match to my natural lip color,  which I honestly wasn't expecting (it appears just a bit more pink on me than in the photos, I was hoping for slightly warmer/less pink) but I am obviously thrilled to have found! My lips can be a bit pale/patchy in color, so this is a huuuge win for me. A very happy accident!  Slip is just freaking gorgeous. My usual go-to nude is Mac's HoneyLove, but the formula on these lipsticks make them just so easy to apply (especially versus Mac's matte formula which takes a bit of care in application), this one is going into heavy rotation for SURE.   I also just slid over to Merit's website to nab Tiger (currently out of stock here) so I think it's safe to say I'm a fan and if they ever go out of business or stop making these I will personally riot."

Perfect to pop on with a full glam look or a more natural daily look. I would pair it with a lip liner for extra coverage and longer wear but, I think it looks great without a lip liner and doesn't feather from the lips from what I've experienced wearing it so far.

However, I'm finding that both of these shades make my lips tingle and then eventually peel. I don't experience this with any other lipsticks and can only name the original Bite Beauty formula as having brought about the same reaction. So, yay for the shades and application and the attractive and weighty packaging. Boo for the reaction. If you react to lip products, proceed with caution."

The color payoff is decent, but it's so balmy and shiny that it takes quite a few swipes to actually get the color to fill right. It applies potently at the outer layers of the lips and then just struggles to get any legitimate color on the inner part of the lips. Then at the first sip/bite of anything, ANYTHING, it transfers immediately off the lips and on to the cups/utensils. Literally fades within seconds. So I guess that's what the sheerness refers to. Why did I pay $26 for a sheer lipstick??? It also claims that the ingredients are so hydrating the color will not settle into lines and accentuate them, but it certainly did for me. All in all, not a worthy purchase. I appreciate the low maintenance natural makeup movement, but this is just a way to take people's money. A tinted balm gives similar color payoff, but much better hydration and benefits for the lips, for much less money."

            "review_text": "I'm always on the hunt these days for lip products that are easy to wear and give me that effortless model off duty look and I think this lipstick does that pretty well.   The shade I purchased, Slip is a warmer neutral brown that falls into the types of shades I typically like to wear. The name for this shade is pretty apt,as the formula itself has a very nice slip to it and it is pretty easy to put on even with minimal or no prep to the lips, but it's not so soft that the formula gets mushy or falls apart as I'm trying to use it. The formula is buildable, but I will say that it still imparts a pretty strong amount of color after a few swipes on (which I don't mind at all), so if you're looking for something more akin to a lip tint this isn't going to be that necessarily unless you choose to blot to tone down the color.  I like the way the formula feels on the lips fairly well, but seeing as my lips are perpetually dry I prefer to prep with a balm beforehand, although for this lipstick I keep that step to a minimum because I've noticed that sometimes it doesn't like to play with my balms very well if I've applied too much.   The component is VERY luxe, for the price I figure I'd be getting another, more expensive brand and it is a pleasure to use and display on my vanity.   Overall, I highly suggest this lippy if you're into products like Glossier Generation G, but you want something less matte, and easier to apply and easier to build. It's a win in my book!"

The formula is so lightweight on the lips, I'd say a very comfortable satin, buidable from sheerish to fuller opacity. It's just the perfect lipstick, in my opinion. I have too many lipsticks to count, so I certainly wasn't looking to buy a new one, but the component and reviews drews me in and boy, it knocked my socks off.

This lipstick can either go on light or more pigmented but stays looking hydrating which is a big win for me. Iu2019ve BEEN over the matte lip - hydrated looking lips win everyyyy. single. time.

As I said, I love them all but the biggest surprise for me was Tiger. I'm not a big red lipstick person, but I liked that it was subdued and as described, more brick coloured. It's perfect.

Moving forward, the color of Tiger is not bright, it's definitely a brick-red at first after a while it does fade fairly quickly--but, into a beautiful lighter shade of brick red. It is almost as if you took your fingers and smudge it a little bit. My lips also felt very soft after putting it on, I'm so used to putting balm first before I put on lipstick but I skipped that for this because it was not needed. If you want a brighter and more extroverted color, I wouldn't pick this one for you. Personally, I would wear this particular color out for dinner if I want to feel elegant."

The color is so present and has a nice duration. And the best part is that it's really moisturizing so that as it wears off there isn't any whiskering on more mature lips! Tiger is described as a warm, brick red and it's rosy when you put it on. You know those products that you immediately move from the lipstick area of your cabinet to the everyday make-up area? This is one of those! Truly my new signature."

The texture is amazing, it glides right on and it is the perfect neutral shade that gives you just a hint of colour for that model-off-duty effortless make-up look!
