I can wear either 160 or 175.  It looks beautiful when first applied, for about 15 minutes. However, this foundation literally dissappears off my face within a few hours. It's like I never had it on. Also, my skin seems to look dry. I do not have this issue with any other foundation (dior, pat mcgrath, about-face, guerlain, gucci, etc.). I have combo skin but only slightly oily in t-zone and slightly dry cheeks. I don't have a lot of texture or wrinkles. I don't wear primer, but I do wear sunscreen (Tatcha or Dr. Dennis Gross). I've tried applying with a brush and beauty blender, ensured my skincare is dry before applying, set with a little powder. I suspect that it has something to do with the triclone technology."

			"review_text": "I was pleasantly surprised by the Haus Labs Foundation in shade 425 Medium Deep Neutral. After struggling with other brands where the formulas or undertones didn’t match, I finally found a foundation that works for my medium tan to medium deep skin tone. The coverage is medium but buildable, giving a dewy, radiant finish that looks fresh and natural. The only issue I found is that the undertone leans a bit more red, but I was able to balance it out with the right concealer in certain areas. Overall, it’s a great match and performs well for my complexion. I have also received many compliments from wearing this foundation.  The price is a tad bit high. But I will have to stock up once their is a sale or use my points."

I tested it out during many shifts at work and my skin looked the same way it looked before I clocked in which was really great. I will say as someone who has oily skin you will look shiny by the end of the day. It’s just how it is unfortunately. With the huda stick foundation it tends to be very matte and I wasn’t so oily by the end of the day but you can tell I was wearing makeup and I feel like with this foundation it looks more natural and I’m willing to have that trade off. just bring the Fenty invisimatte powder in your purse and you’ll be fine :)"

I have a few acne scars and it doesn't cover them (not surprising as it's labelled medium coverage) but it evens out my skin tone beautifully and it lasts long. I would recommend!

I feel like it has a satin skinlike finish. The color match is great. I also love that on it's own, it works great as an eyeshadow primer.   Cons: The only con I feel is that if you have dry skin, it will enhance the appearance of your dry skin. I have dry-normal skin and it's the winter so I'm more dry. I HAVE to prep my skin with some serum and day moisturizer to make sure the foundation looks smooth. Or it just looks cakey, cracked, flaky if your skin is thirsty. So if you have constant dry skin, it may not work for you if you don't feel like or have time to prep before you do your makeup."

After the first use i noticed the foundation is very moisturizing, and after wearing to work and altogether a 12 hour day, my skin actually felt smoother and looked brighter after removing my make up and cleaning my face. Im writing this review after one week of 12-15 hour wear and I love this foundation. I feel a big improvement in my skin overall when I’m not wearing make up and a foundation that hydrates, lasts all day and does not cause me to break out."

I tried it again with a primer and still no luck, it sunk into my skin by few hours and my under eyes looked bad. The finish of the foundation is beautiful don't get me wrong, but it didn't last. i am one of those ppl who firmly believe that products and stuff should fit into your lifestlye and not the other way around, so I returned it.

While it’s a little pricey and can highlight dry patches if you don’t prep well, the overall quality is worth it. I would definitely recommend this foundation to anyone looking for something long-lasting and natural-looking!"

Make sure, though, if you're an ultra fair person like me, that you do CC, otherwise the discoloration will show through.

I couldn't find my match, I have an olive undertone and usually mix a little to get my right match but with all of the colors I chose none of them worked. It's blends well to your face but not with other products. I don't just use foundation, I out on blush and bronzer but they did not blend as well with this foundation which was another bummer. I drove 40min as planned to end up returning all of them since none matched but the person from the store wouldn't accept the returns. I explained to her that I was just trying to color match and there were 2 that weren't even opened cause I could easily tell that I was way off with those but she still didn't accept my return. I spent so much money on them I felt bad just throwing them out until today. Biggest waste of money and the worst experience I've had at Sephora. My friends have done the same thing before with no issues. I started spending a lot less since then and now I don't care to try new things since you never know who Sephora will accept returns from. My friends were upset too cause they do this all the time. It's not a cheap product and I bought too many to test for all of them to not match."

Why is rosy labeled warm? The shade that should have worked for me was extremely off. Definitely go in to get shade matched if you are considering this. However, I was willing to go into the store to exchange for the right shade if I liked the formula but it was awful on my skin. It settled into every fine line (I'm 28 so I don't have many), it was extremely blotchy, it separately so bad, and it also gathered on my rose and around my eyebrows. I can't imagine what type of skin this would work for. The concealer also creased so bad for me as well."

			"review_text": "I’m still fairly new to makeup, but I’ve established with myself that I prefer powder foundations over liquid foundations as it works better for my oily skin in the humid summer. But with cold and dry weather on its way, it’s time to switch to a liquid form foundation that could help with my dehydrated skin but still work with my oily skin. I started with the drugstore and found some okay options but nothing that satisfied my needs and made me put a hard stop on my searching. I decided to take a chance with this foundation after hearing many great things. From the first swatch in my shade matching at Sephora, I just knew this would be the one. I already loved the way it felt on my cheek. When the sephora employee found my perfect shade, I looked in the mirror and I couldn’t even tell she had swatched it, and it solidified it for me: I. LOVE. THIS. FOUNDATION! Having dehydrated skin, I just love how hydrating and nourishing the formulation feels on my skin. It doesn’t settle into my pores, accentuate my texture, or cling to dry spots. Having oily skin, it feels so lightweight and barely there and leaves a skin-like natural radiant finish. The longevity and performance of this is top notch. Even when my natural oils start to break through, the foundation stays put and together (I also don’t wear primer at all under makeup). I’m a yoga teacher, and even in my hot yoga class, sweating didn’t disturb the foundation too much. Yes, there was some transfer when I dabbed the sweat off my face with a towel, but my face still looked good and smooth. It also plays well with my powder foundations when I touch up throughout the day. All-in-all, this foundation is amazing and it’s pretty much my “Holy Grail”. I just started a no-buy with a goal of emptying out my current foundation products, and after wearing this foundation, I know I’ll be able to stick to it and use it to the last drop. And honestly, I don’t think I’ll replace it with anything else at Sephora."

I only use 2 small drops to cover my whole face and build a little where needed. The minus one star is for the bottle with the stick - it leaks down the bottle neck and I can see quite a bit of this be wasted.

I tried a few different ways to apply, using a lot vs a little, brush vs sponge, different primers and setting powders. No matter what this foundation just sits on top and doesn’t give me a skin like finish. I also found that it moves A LOT while I’m trying to finish my base and usually breaks apart around my mouth and nose by the end of the day. It’s not awful, the issues are manageable but it’s definitely not a repurchase for me. Bright side though, I do have very sensitive skin and this didn’t break me out or cause any irritation."

It has a very watery consistency and would get absorbed into my beauty blender. Also, the pump applicator was so bad from the start. Product would leak out from around the pump and get into the lid and outside of the bottle. I'm almost done my bottle and for a while now, part of the pump completely detached and product is leaking everywhere all the time. Also, sometimes when I pump to get product out, it sprays onto my clothing, etc. Most recently, because the applicator is so bad, it all exploded in my makeup bag and made such a big mess. I will not be purchasing this again."

I gave this a shot on whim after a lot of reading Reddit reviews and googling. I couldn’t be happier.

I’m acne prone so I was worried that I would break out since this is a more moisturizing formula. I should have known I can always trust Mother Monster (haha). Not only did this cover my psoriasis but it helped with the flakiness too. I know better but I ended up sleeping in it and I didn’t break out at all!

As it didn't cause irritation or clog my pores, I thought it might be worth some additional experimentation. When I considered that less might be more, I tried applying it with a damp sponge. Bingo! It is definitely buildable, but only to a certain point. After a few hours of wear, I do need to blot my t-zone, but the product does not separate, so it continues to look good post-blot. If your pre-foundation routine involves a lot of thick moisturizers, I can imagine this might look a little heavy. Finding the best method of application to work harmoniously with other skincare products might take a bit of experimentation, but I think it is worth it. Also, this contains no fragrance.

For years I was oily, wore DW religiously to combat, but as my skin changed with age to combo and now leaning normal, I find my old HG to be too drying, heavy and even agin… now this one feels so light, comfortable and lasts pretty well for a non-matte foundation.  I love that I was able to try good sized samples to find my perfect shade. I also can adjust with white drops during the winter when my skin is paler and it pairs beautiful with dew drops for added glow. I do still set this lightly with powder, but overall I’m very happy!"

I mix 070 and 060 which is a perfect match for my fair neutral, slightly cool skin tone, better than any other foundation I’ve ever tried.  My skin doesn’t continue to dry out, get flaky or redden, which is kind of amazing.  It’s the only one I’ve found in the last 10 years that didn’t cause any issues, except for one, and it’s a big one.  As the day goes on, my lungs become wheezy and tight from all of the herbal extracts in the formula. The arnica is fine, it’s the dandelion and all of the others that fall into the “hay fever” category, and after 3 weeks of being in denial, I have to accept that I absolutely cannot wear it.  I’m beyond bummed.  I still recommend it, because the finish is gorgeous."

I feel so confident going into my big day, knowing this will last all day (with setting spray) and photograph beautifully. I already wore it for my engagement pictures, and it turned out amazing. I use the Skinfix peptide moisturizer for skin prep, followed by Naked Sundays mineral sunscreen. Apply with a brush, then lightly dab over with a sponge. It is *chef's kiss*.

I called Sephora and got a lovely lady that let me know all would be taken care of immediately. IT CAME the next in the evening. I will forever buy my skincare and makeup from here.

It doesn't play well with every possible product you can be layering with it, but no foundation does-- I suspect layering issues are behind a lot of the bad reviews. I'm on my second bottle. I absolutely recommend this product, it's super comfortable to wear and I've never gotten so many compliments from strangers on my makeup as I do since I've started wearing this. It doesn't fade or oxidize in general use; my last bottle oxidized a little as I got to the very bottom, but that was literally the very last couple drops of a bottle I'd been using for 8 months or more."

It's on the dewier side and doesn't last super long without power on my combo-oily skin. However, I found that it wears off really gracefully. Even on long days, a little bit of powder brought it back to life.   My favorite part about this foundation is how reliable it is. I use retinol in my skincare, so I often get flakey skin around my mouth and forehead. This foundation always performs beautifully, no matter the state of my skin.   Also I definitely noticed that my skin looked a lot calmer and moisturized when I wore it often, so the skincare-led formula is definitely effective.   The shades of this foundation are a little strange, but I found that 100 fits me perfectly for most of the year. It's so sad that my shade has been sold out for months, so I had to switch to a different foundation."

After everything is absorbed into my skin I put this on with high hopes. I have combo and mature skin and right out of the gate it stuck to every imperfection. Lines were enhanced and somehow on my highly prepped skin it still manages to give me patchy dry spots. When I saw the udder disaster that was happening I thought maybe I had messed up the pregame steps. Since my makeup was already ruined at this point and I would leave my house with it on I did the other half of my face with my IT CC cream just to see if we had the same outcome on the other side. Nope, my normal foundation went on like a dream. So why did I buy this if I have 2 amazing foundations that I wear on the regular? Everyone had hyped this up so much I figured it must really be worth it, and it was slightly cheaper than my GA foundation so maybe it would save me money in the long run. Nope, I tried it twice ( I will give everything a fair shot) and the outcome both times managed to make my skin look older, dryer and just gross."

Like MAC’s foundation, this stuff was impossible to get a nice base that’s actually medium coverage, long lasting, etc. I’ve tried a few different methods and no matter what, I was left with a patchy, oily mess that looked like greasy sunscreen and got //everywhere//. Primers didn’t help, and powders either made it cakey or separate.   The product is super thin and practically gets soaked up by a beauty sponge, but takes forever to blend with your fingers if you don’t want a splotchy mess 😭  Really sad this didn’t work out as it’s SO hard to find high end white foundation."

So I'm passing along what worked for me:   Normal skin prep, Milk hydro grip primer, and either a large fluffy concealer brush or a small fluffy foundation brush. Starting with a few drops on the back of your hand, load your brush, then swirl and press into your skin (press into skin on areas that need more coverage, like around the nose or where you see brush strokes). Then, if you need more coverage, repeat this process.  Set with with a little bit of powder and finish with setting spray (I used Milk hydro grip setting spray or Kryolan fixing spray).  When I applied using this technique, it stayed pretty much all day with minimal touch-ups.   The trick was applying in thin layers.  When I tried to apply it in a single layer (like a typical foundation) or used a beauty blender to apply it, it looked like hot garbage (patchy, separated, and cakey)   Also, if your skin is sensitive to silicone ingredients, get a sample first.  The silicone in this caused my skin to break out."

I turn 50 this year. So during the sale I decided to give it another go. This time I was even more careful selecting products that were going to layer underneath it. For this foundation to apply and LOOK GREAT it’s even more important than usual to make sure EVERY product used underneath is water based or it will just sit in every crevice and pore. But once you get your routine down let me just say that it’s stunning!! I have never had a foundation like it. My makeup seems to look even better as the day progresses. It definitely lives up to all the hype.  It gets an A+++ from me!! A 10/10!!"

It provides perfect coverage that evens out my skin but also still allows my skin to show through and doesn’t look like I have a thick layer of product on. The coverage is buildable too and is especially great at covering redness due to rosacea. My skin is on the dry side and I have never experienced flaking underneath like I have with other foundations.

Huge red bumps, not tiny whiteheads, so maybe more of an allergic reaction? It's so disappointing because it looked so promising, but now my usually clear skin is thrashed. Only wore it for one day, washed my face, and realized it's going to have to be a pass for me.

First off - I'm SHOCKED by the accuracy of the shade finder quiz because I never validated my shade IRL and based on the quiz alone my shade was a perfect match (which I refused to believe based on the undertone it assigned me). The formula is the perfect medium, semi-buildable coverage with the most skin-like finish. The amount of compliments I get on my skin when wearing this is insane. It wears really well through the day and is comfortable on the skin and relatively hydrating! Over the course of 2 months even in fluxuating weather my complexion still looked great. I also never had any skin breakouts or irritation throughout using this formula. 10/10!"

It gives me a truly perfect look that no other foundation is capable of. I have been wearing it every single day since Haus Labs sent me a bottle. (blessed btw) This is my new holy grail product. My makeup isn't the same without it. I appreciate how it can be lightweight or full coverage, depending on what kind of look you want to achieve. For work, a lighter coverage look is perfect for me. But when I want to be fully snatched, layering the product gives me a beautiful plastic doll look that I am obsessed with. Every other makeup product layers beautifully on top as well.

Color matching is darn near impossible -- I would NOT recommend trying to do this online, because the descriptions of the colors vs the actual in-person colors are very different. I've heard this from other people & influencers who say their undertones are different from other brands (meaning, cool is actually warm, warm is actually cool, and neutral is...a total shot in the dark). I don't understand the reasoning behind this, as it makes color matching extraordinarily tough and more trouble than it's worth.  I am pretty fair/light with neutral undertones that can pull a little more cool, push comes to shove. I ended up with the shade 110, which is supposed to be neutral, but every time I put it on I think wow that looks yellow. But hey, I can make it work...or so I thought.  This always ends up looking cake on me and never really settles into my skin. I've done a total overhaul of my skin prep to include fewer products (one serum and a sunscreen) to allow the foundation to melt into my skin, but it just never looks right. It doesn't build, it always looks patchy in areas, and I find myself washing my face a couple hours after I put it on because it just looks bad.  That said, I LOVE the extensive shade range, and the finish is really pretty - natural satin, but finding a color that works for me has been such a frustrating experience (I swatched probably 7 shades in store, none of them really right), and I don't think my skin likes this. Everyone is different, and different things work for different people, but I have not had luck with this"

This one made my skin look dry, accentuates every line and pore and then added insult to injury by coming off at the slightest touch even with powder. I’m a physician who was running late so I didn’t gave time to wash it off and use a different one. It got all over the collar and lapel of my lab coat. Looked super professional. Ugh.

			"review_text": "There’s so much to love about this product, but so much to hate unfortunately 🥲. First, I will say, the application is beautiful if you have the right skin for it. Although it is a skin like finish, the foundation itself is thick, sludgy almost, you notice this significantly when cleaning your makeup brushes or sponge and squeeze out the thick film like residue it leaves.  But a little product goes a long way, one bottle will last me around two months. You must shake the bottle each time before use or by the end you’ll end up with a weird separated version of the formula.   I started cycling retinol into my routine and my skin is no longer compatible with this formula unfortunately. Clung to dry patches like crazy and I felt even aided in the dryness of my skin. Another thing to note is this foundation oxidizes like crazy. Took a few purchases to find my right color but the match was pretty spot on.  The last and final thing is the TRANSFER. Even with a primer, high end setting powder and setting spray this foundation transferred like nothing I’ve ever used. I almost gave up wearing white clothes completely because I would always somehow have a transfer on my neckline and random fingerprints all over my clothes and belongings from resting my chin on my hand or touching my face, even in the slightest bit. This is the main reason I won’t be repurchasing 🥲"

I used to use the Dior airflash foundation which feels like nothing on the skin and this gives the same feeling. It’s more of a soft matte finish but honestly looks rather natural. Wear time is great too. It doesn’t break up in oily areas and doesn’t bunch up in the nose creases. The only downside is the lack of shades. I’m or a light olive complexion and I was surprised that there is no olive shades in the light range. I have to use a green primer underneath to get the right color match. Overall really great foundation and I always get compliments on my skin when I wear this."

I like testing foundations because each has a distinctly different effect on your face and I think there is something magical about that. All that being said Haus Labs got the magic in the sauce because the foundation wears well throughout the day. The formula sits comfortably on the face and makes your face feel softer which is cool I guess.

If using this for a low-coverage look, I find that it works best applied with a finger for a skinlike texture. This also dries very quickly when applied on the back of the hand and then dabbed on, so I recommend just using small dots at a time.  Image with (left) and without (right), just used under the eye."

			"review_text": "This is one of the most natural skin like foundations in the clean category - BUT the brand has done a terrible job of giving instructions + the brushes they sell for this aren’t the best ones to apply it. Also, you need good, gently exfoliated skin that has a MEDIUM (not high) level of moisture on it. How to apply to get her great results & look like you’re not wearing anything: 1. Regular, gentle chemical exfoliation. 2. Mist face with water/ rose water 3. Press oil or moisturizer in gently (don’t make it too oily) 4. Wait a couple of mins for it to absorb so skin feels comfortable but not dewy or oily to the touch. Not too dry not too moisturized - better to be a bit more dry than dewy 5. Don’t stiple, BUFF a tiny amount on your face, using circular motions (imagine you’re trying to polish your face with the brush). Don’t use a lot at once, use drop by drop, build it up slowly. Use a flat top buffing brush, the kind you use for bare minerals or mineral foundations or powder mineral foundation. Flat bristles are essential to buffing. Buff as much as possible. If you don’t buff and build slowly every shade in this line (I’ve tried several shades) will oxidize / turn warm or orange. The line leans warm (and their definition of warm and cool and peach is their own / doesn’t make sense to me). Choose something that is cooler toned than you normally would or mix a bit of blue or cool toned blush in to correct (if non returnable). DO NOT use primer especially silicon ones (you WILL become orange). Treat this like a mineral foundation and it will give you great results - SKIN like results, no makeup makeup results"

When applying, it looks beautiful, and i only need one full layer. A few hours later, however, I feel it starts to really set into any fine line or dry spot i may have on my face. It seems to be doing too my face what full coverage foundations do (which is why i don’t wear them.)   Confused. Gave it two shots with different moisturizer base each time and got same result. Will probably return and stick to my tried and true $40 foundation   *For reference i have textured, acne prone skin."

My complexion looks pretty good in my regular vanity mirror but when I look up close with the magnified side I can definitely see where the foundation has settled into my dry areas. I don’t have any silicone primers to pair with this so I used the elf niacinamide power grip, definitely want to experiment more with the right primer and see if that patching problem gets fixed. This foundation has a satin finish that doesn’t feel too heavy on the skin. Overall,  I’d rate this like a 7/10.

Then I would be concerned or breakouts and shine. On that, 45 mins and I could see redness through the foundation and concealer. The formula gave me a burning and red circles and little pimples almost immediately. I’m sorry mama Monster. I had to return it the same day of use and go back to Dior.

I’m shade 040, which is way more neutral than the picture suggests, which makes it look very pink. I got this as a result of the quiz, but then visited a Sephora store to test them in person. I swiped the shades on my neck, and picked the one that disappeared–and this one was perfect! Sometimes I mix it with a skin tint for a little more coverage on a lightweight day, and to make the bottle last as long as possible. I bought my first bottle during a sale, and Haus just GIFTED me another one in my shade! So so grateful, now I get to use it more often without the fear of running out!"

Switch to shade 100 but this colour was a bit too light.  I'd need to purchase both shades and blend them in order to get a colour match and - at CA $65/ bottle, that's not happening. Coverage is light to medium, and the formula blends really well. Some creasing under my eyes and on my eyelids after intial application but once the product was set with powder it was fine. I recommend you go in-store before purchasing. The Sephora rep who assisted me admitted the undertoness were an issue when I returned shade 110. The rep and I were aware shade 100 wasn't an exact match for my skin but she suggested I try it for a few days, which I did, but the colour is just too pale and requires a lot of bronzer to warm things up. Had I been able to find my shade I would absolutely use this foundation everyday. The formula is a perfect balance between matte and hyrdating. If the undertones are ever reformulated I would definitely repurchase."

Since discovering Haus Labs Triclone Skin Tech Foundation, I have never bought another brand since. It blends into my skin like butter, and I don't even feel like I'm wearing anything on my face. I have gotten NUMEROUS compliments from people and once I tell them I'm wearing Haus Labs, they almost always respond with I can't even tell you're wearing makeup (which is my goal!).

In terms of performance, the foundation provides decent coverage, effectively balancing out skin tone and concealing imperfections. I was surprised at how surprisingly lightweight it felt, offering a feel that's more substantial than sheer but without the heaviness often associated with full-coverage foundations. It didn’t feel like I was wearing makeup. Texture-wise, the foundation scores points for not being sticky or oily, a plus for those seeking a comfortable, non shiny finish throughout the day.  The process of online color matching turned out to be quite effective, resulting in a shade that closely matched my skin tone. This accuracy in digital color selection is commendable and shows that the brand has invested in making sure customers can find their right match remotely.  On the downside, the packaging, although visually appealing, falls short in practicality. The lack of an applicator tip was my only notable drawback. The current stick design can lead to dripping, which is not ideal for those who need to apply their makeup quickly or while on the move. This aspect of the design could be improved to enhance the overall user experience.  Disclosure that I received the Haus labs foundation in exchange for an honest review."

Let me tell you Haus Labs concealer is so beautiful it gives me the coverage I need without looking to thick. Usually I apply it with a beauty blender but I used it with the concealer brush and let me tell you I got the more beautiful finish ever. I set it Huda Beauty setting powder and it lasted all night without sinking in my lines and ceasing. This is definitely my new go to concealer. I got so many compliments all night. And also tried there foundation it’s absolutely stunning give you the glow you’re looking for. It reminds me of the Nars light reflecting foundation. The only recommendation I can give you on the foundation it the color match it a little different from online I needed two shades lighter then it said online. If you can make it into a Sephora to get color matched I recommend you do."

Lasted really well for a night out, and did not flake or wear off at all. Most importantly my skin still looked like skin! This foundation is my new go-to. Thank you HAUSLABS and Lady Gaga!!"

It looked pink and I was like okay I'm gonna try....needless to say it's not a pink foundation and it's just a fair-light neutral shade. when I put it on with my brush it was a perfect!!!! match, like my skin but way better. I used a lil setting powder to matte it down and I looked flawless. I am in love !!!! I never looked so perfect skinned in my life, I get hives and redness from stress and it completely covered it up! With very lil product. I didn't look cakey and it never moved at all from my face. I highly recommend this foundation. if I could give 100 stars I would. Giving away my fenty beauty foundation and ordering a back up of this foundation. the packaging feels very luxurious and expensive. the glass bottle is so butterfly soft. Don't hesitate and order!

I put this foundation on today and worked a 7.5 hour serving shift and my makeup looked great before and after. I felt that it didn’t accentuate my texture and it went really well with my nars concealer to get the full coverage look without the cakey-ness. I have seen some reviews that the foundation doesn’t dry down and they aren’t completely wrong. I struggled with getting it to fully dry down but when I used setting powder (elf halo glow or Fenty powder) it settled and was dry enough that I felt good about layering other products. I have only wore it once so I am unsure how it will impact my acne but I have a good feeling so far. I would definitely recommend giving this foundation a try especially for my acne girlies or guys"

I put Shiseido on half my face and this on the other half and the Shiseido side is dry, albeit the wrong shade for me.   Also this is a slightly sheerer coverage than I would like. I could probably build it up, but would rather not have to, particularly since even one layer doesn't dry. Every time I touch my face some color comes away on my fingertips. And all I have under this is sunblock, no moisturizer, concealer, etc. and it still won't dry down.  That said, I'm not wearing any makeup in this photo other than the foundation and some lip gloss. I'm 57, so I consider this to be a good foundation to be able to achieve this look on its own.   The shade 385 is a perfect match for my skin color though and I will definitely keep this, though my search for the perfect foundation is not over yet."

This is unlike any foundation I've ever worn, including the colors being atypical of what I buy. As a VERY fair skinned person, I'm used to being cool but it turned out for this brand I am neutral. Also, this cannot be applied in strokes with a brush or fingers. The foundation sticks well to texture and putting it on in this way makes it look very ugly and it breaks all over the place. However, it goes on like a DREAM with a wet sponge--the skin looks glowy and soft, and it looks just like perfected skin. when setting it and giving it a spritz with a face mist, the glass skin technique can be achieved too.  I will say that this is one of the few foundations that leaves me looking forward to seeing my skin after I take it off too. My skin is healthier than before, with limited redness and even texture after wearing this foundation for two weeks. It is well worth it."

This foundation glides easy and it looks thin on the face. However, it does look a little cakey and is not covering my dry patches well. It also oxidizes for about a shade darker. It doesn't last well, maybe around 6 hours it will show clear smudging. I used loose powder and setting spray separately to test out how long it lasts, but both can't make it last longer. I think from a social distance, this foundation looks great. But on close-ups, it definitely seems a bit cakey. Overall, it is a good foundation for daily use, but your skin condition needs to be really good."

With all the extra skincare goodies in this foundation it seemed like a great option. I’ve got fairly balanced skin, live in an extremely dry climate and have a few fine lines and yet this foundation never seemed to fully set. Always a bit of dewy slip to it.

He actually went and immediately got me a full size haha! I did a  couple wear tests and after 12 hours it looked just as flawless as when I put it on. I also tested it again with a different primer and layering it on a little more. Setting it heavier with powder and no matter what I did it still looked flawless.

			"review_text": "So I have worn this foundation 3-4 times now and it took me a couple of uses to solidify how I feel about it. This really mimics your skin, but that means if your skin is really oily or dry, it’ll emphasize that. The first application, I applied it with my fingers and it looked like it wasn’t really becoming one with my skin. It was emphazising my texture and didn’t really look glowy or dewy and wasn’t as natural of a finish as I was expecting. I tried using it again with a beauty sponge and it did the same thing, not really sinking in and melting into the skin… so the next time I tried it, I decided to really play around with skin prep. I used my regular essence and moisturizer, but added glowy serum and doubled up my moisturizer so my face was tacky and dewy. This went on like a dream! So flawless and seamless and skin like, and wore all night. My skin looks incredible but only if I layer the right hydrating products. Otherwise, it looks almost matte on my skin. I took one star off because I feel like it should make skin naturally dewy and skin like without having to layer serums and creams, but the way it performs with the right skin prep has made me reconsider exchanging it. I’ve decided to keep it as I love the packaging and I love the texture and weightlessness of the formula! Just ensure you have the right skin prep for your skin type and the finish you are trying to achieve."

This just made this overpriced product twice as expensive just trying to return it. Buy Maybelline instead. Same quality."

I find this to be a slightly thicker alternative to the Armani Luminous silk (my other HG) with fuller coverage and longer staying power. 260 light medium cool Is a perfect match to the luminous silk shade 6 which is a light-medium/medium golden shade with olive undertones.  An online beauty assistant originally shade matched me to something way too neutral, and I knew I should’ve just went with my gut and ordered 260.  This foundation blends with ease, whether I use a brush or beauty blender, but I prefer the latter. It does a nice job of covering up blemishes on its own, so I rarely have to spot conceal. It lasts a full work day and more on my oily/combo skin and never gets too shiny or patchy. The general finish is natural with a slight glow (on me).  I do pair this with the Haus Labs concealer and they blend seamlessly together. I am so so pleased with this foundation! I use it everyday for work and special occasions. The only con I have is that the glass bottle is very heavy (but very luxe)."

I pair this foundation with the Anastasia translucent setting powder and it gives this foundation such a good matte look but if you want it to be more natural you can use a setting spray/a tiny bit of powder, or if you want a dewy look you can just apply it with a brush and pat it out with a beauty blender.

			"review_text": "For years, I've struggled to match a foundation shade perfectly; my first 27 years living in the Philippines where colorism favors lighter skin have given me no foundation option other than a variation of light pinks and yellows that made me look like a ghost. Moving to the US and having access to darker shades made me think it would be easier to find a great shade match, but even after 2 years the warm shades would always be too yellow/orange on my face, and neutral shades would always register olive and grey against my skin. While finding the right shade in Haus Labs was a struggle in itself, when I did, it was nothing short of a miracle. I found out that I had a golden undertone, but with peach mixed in (HL follows MAC undertone labelling: cool is warm, warm is cool), and when my test swatch melted onto my skin, it was such a great feeling.  I have been using this foundation since I got it, and it blends seamlessly onto my face. I do have an oily face and have to touch up here and there, but nothing too drastic. The finish is a dewy second-skin and is great for winter. It is lightweight and doesn't leave my skin feeling dry or gross. A little goes a long way; one and a half pumps were more than enough to even out my skintone. No separation observed so far, but I do set it with the Givenchy Prisme Libre or Makeup Forever HD Setting Powder throughout the day. Needless to say, this is my favorite foundation thus far based on shade match and formula. Don't hesitate to give this a try!"

I have pretty clear skin with some closed comodones, texture, redness etc; this covers up ALL of that with one pump and leaves my skin looking so supple and soft. Literally skin like. Idk if they put crack in this stuff because I haven’t ever found a foundation that makes my skin look flawless but like im wearing nothing. Definitely a great medium.  2. I take my skincare very seriously and I found that freshly washing my skin before hand gives me the best results and truly shows off the potential of this foundation. I understand this isn’t convenient or always possible, but I’ve used it without and it still looks great but skincare is important as a base for any foundation so take that as you will :)  3. My holy grail pair as a base for this foundation is the Bobbi brown vitamin C moisturizer. Yes I know. It’s tragic and utterly said a bottle of that stuff is 100 dollars but I think ANY hydrating moisturizer would make this foundation gleam!  4. My skin type is dry with some oiliness on my nose and forehead, the wear on this stuff is amazing I don’t find myself feeling like a puddle of oil throughout the day. It wear soooo beautifully  5. I wore this to my nursing graduation and it photographed beautifully, it looked like I had a filter on my skin  Overall, this is my HG foundation and nothing else on the market had matched up to it for me. I’ve tried everything from NARS radiant and Luminous silk, to elf and L’Oréal. Literally almost everything. This took the cake for me :) if the bad reviews still put you off, Sephora gives free samples, it won’t hurt"

For reference, I used to be a makeup junkie and am very well versed in application, skin care, etc. As I’ve aged, had children , and grown to  Understand what suits me, I’ve realized that I don’t appreciate the look of a full face of makeup. Although my skin is not nearly as flawless as it was in my early 20s , it’s not that bad either- but I do suffer from rosacea flare ups around my cheeks which is the main purpose for my foundation. I got hooked on the Chanel le beige aqua fresh water skin tint because it’s both a skin care and a lightweight foundation and doesn’t feel (or look) at all like you are wearing makeup.   I purchased the haus labs foundation for a night out and because a Sephora rep highly recommended it.  Anyways, almost immediately upon application, I removed the foundation as I felt it was extremely heavy and looked like a mask - exactly what I try to avoid with makeup. I’ve also watched YouTube and TikTok videos of people applying the foundation and I have to say I’ve seen many cases where they look better before the foundation.  With that being said, I think this is probably a very good formula for people who want a full face of makeup that will cover all imperfections. For me, I just feel that it looks way too heavy and unnatural and not at all like real skin ( for me). This could be because as I said, I’ve grown to appreciate the look of a little bit of skin imperfection shining through. I returned this foundation and will instead opt for the Armani luminous foundation if I want a bit more coverage but still want to look natural.   So- to sum up, if you’re someone that does not like even a bit of heavy foundation, i would say skip this product and opt for either the Chanel le beige or the Armani luminous silk (worth the price). If you love a full face of makeup- you’ll probably like this."

I read a lot of negative reviews, and here are my thoughts:  this is a difficult foundation to find your shade in- it’s color matching is totally different than every other foundation and you really have to try it in store.  A little goes a long way- apply a little on your hand and apply with a brush, build it slowly.  Your skincare routine maters more than the makeup- how you treat your skin and what you use under the foundation is important.  I follow Nikki La Rose on YouTube, she does a fantastic job of explaining this particular product and in general is a great makeup resource, so check her channel out!"

I liked the coverage and shade range, but this foundation emphasizes texture on my skin, while also making my oily skin look flakey and dry? This was very confusing for me because I usually have the opposite problem - my oily skin makes me look like a greaseball after a few hours of wearing foundation. This foundation also did not wear well for me throughout the day - it separated and was patchy in many areas on my cheeks and jaw after 3hrs. I always set my foundation with powder and never have issues like this. I still do not understand why this formula does not work well for me, but I am very disappointed and would not recommend it."

I followed their shade selector on the website and was skeptical, but when I received this foundation, it was amazing! The match is perfect and looks totally natural. I was worried as it looked like the formula went on very thinly and I didn't know if I'd have enough coverage- it's deceiving ,because while it's light weight, the coverage is fantastic and looks very natural. I also have sensitive skin and tend to break out from some foundations, this one is actually making my skin look better all around, likely thanks to the Arnica. One bottle also lasts quite a while.

I used this foundation when I had my professional headshots taken and for my graduation photoshoot, which gave me a beautiful glow in my photos. I also took this foundation on vacation to the Philippines during May/June where the weather was humid and was averaging 90°F without feeling like my face will melt off. I'm unsure how this foundation performs without primer, but I used the Elf Power Grip Primer. I am not a fan of low coverage foundation so I appreciate how this has a buildable, medium to high coverage. I also love how this foundation has a skin-like finish. If you want it to look more matte, you can always put on more powder.  I'm not really a fan of trying new foundations once I've found one I already like, but I'm glad to have tried this foundation, which has now become my new favorite."

I don't know what Lady Gaga has done, but this is the creamiest, radiant, buildable, most skin like foundation I have ever used.  I got color matched at Sephora because after summer vacation, even with 50 SPF and all the sun protection I could wear, I still was a bit tan.  The color match now is a little off after being home for 3 months, but it doesn't matter a bit.  It blends in, doesn't oxidize or move around, get patchy or anything.  I am so thrilled with this one that unless it changes, this is it for me.  I may go lighter as Winter progresses but it seems to be somewhat self adjusting so I many not need to.  It give great coverage too but you don't need to pile it on.  Two thin layers do the trick.  I set it with setting spray and it lasts until just about bedtime.  Highly recommend."

This review will compare a few products in shades light-neutral: In the photo on top: shade 100 in haus middle, 20n tarte Amazonian clay bottom, top super goop glow sunscreen in Sunset. All are supposed to be light neutral.  So for haus, the sample bottle is super cute - it looks like a little mini bottle of yellow paint. That would be great if I had yellow undertones but 100 is supposed to be light neutral. Why is it so hard for brands to create a true neutral that doesn’t lean pink yellow, orange or grey?  And I used my points for this! It’s disappointing in color match but I could get over that and find another shade if I liked the formula. I don’t. It is very oily and kinda greasy feeling and sits in my pores instead of blending in and smoothing. It’s kinda a gluey formula on the skin- it doesn’t cover, doesn’t plump and doesn’t give a nice glowy look. ( Comparing all three, so far even though it’s a tiny bit on orange, I like the super goop glow serum in sunset the best - because the formula covers and evens tone and smooths it all out  without sitting on top of every imperfection, add to that a little healthy subtle glow,  and it’s a win. Reminder it’s not a foundation so it’s a thinner coverage but easier to blend and just throw on and go)"

This product really is a 10 out of 10 also the shade range is amazing. I definitely recommend this foundation. In both the pictures I had worn the make up for at least 10 hours.

It feels weightless on the skin, blends easy, and is buildable to a fuller coverage.  The two main disadvantages for me: 1) I have dry skin, and at 58 this product settles into fine lines quite quickly.  I tried it for a full week, I applied serums, primers and moisturizers to no avail. 2)  Although there is quite a shade selection, I do not feel there is enough of an accurate representation of shades for us pink undertone gals. When you look at the shade selection online, it doesn’t come close to the color you receive in the bottle. :(  Even the shade fair cool was more on the “yellow” spectrum.  I also tried blending it with some other foundations and color corrector.  It just wasn’t for me.  I would love to try it again if there were more shades within slightly more pink undertones.  Also, if consideration were given to mature skin gals as well."

No matter what shade or undertone I selected- it gave me a weird sickly tint just like the other photos.  I am normally light and have a warm undertone.  I match rare beauty tinted moisturizer in shade 24N and Dynessa myricks shade 4 in tinted moisturizer.  Shade 160 was very yellow, shade 175 was dark and orange and shade 120 was almost cool toned but also orange.  Every shade I tried looked super unnatural despite only using a tiny amount.  It was also very dry and matte on me.  My fave looked weird and sickly just like 99% of the review photos.  I went into store and tried a few other shades.  This is one of the worst looking foundations I have ever tried.  Because of the skin care ingredients and it’s promise to “calm” skin I was desperate to make it work, but don’t believe the hype- it’s gross."

Wow! I don't care that I purchased two bottles even though I could have made it work with one. This foundation is worth it because I will never again have to buy foundations that I either give away or sit looking fancy in my drawer. This is it! I am 60 years old and it definitely looks like my skin but better. This is my first review of any product. I just usually spend the money and deal with it. For reference, I use Nars Caracas on the perimeter and Dior 4.5N in the center of my face. It works - mostly I guess. Haus Labs is it! Oh - and this is important - Don't use too much. It really is a dab will do you product. So, if you are like me and have to mix colors - you will have them forever. Lovely, lovely product. I should feel a bit sad for the other makeup companies but somehow I just don't. Haus Labs has hit it out of the ballpark and has changed the game. My skin with foundation looks lovely. Thank you"

This is hands down, no questions, my favorite foundation of all time! It’s a super thin formula that legitimately feels like a soothing serum on your skin. I thought the coverage would be too sheer because of this but it’s not…it’s a true medium buildable coverage. I have a good amount of sunspots and pigmentation to cover and it truly covers it. You can sheer it out some and let your freckles peek through though too. It’s hydrating but also blurring at the same time, which is really hard to come by. Sephora has it listed as “Natural Finish” and I think that’s pretty accurate, although I would really call it an “after spa finish.” Lol. It probably depends on your skincare and skin type but on me (normal/dry skin from tretinoin) it’s a natural leaning dewy finish but it does set down and still stays a little luminous, which I love. It also lasts all day on me. I set it with either the Hourglass or Huda loose powder or the Kosas Cloud set. My favorite thing about it is that it is COMPLETELY undetectable on my skin yet still covers everything I want and blurs my pores and fine lines! It’s truly everything I’ve always wanted in a foundation. I’ve seriously tried a million foundations too because I’ve always been searching for that holy grail…I finally found it. Plus it’s cruelty free and vegan! Oh and if you’re looking for your shade online I would do the shade finder on the Haus Labs website. Don’t go by the Sephora shade finder cause it would have been soooo wrong if I listened to that…the Haus Labs was dead on. The shades do seem to run a little darker than you might think and the undertones are super whacky if you’re not going with a neutral shade (cool is warm and warm is cool) so if you can go in to the store it might be helpful. I was matched on Haus Labs to 110 and it’s perfect though."

I would have been pi$$ed off  if I had wasted more money than that trying this foundation.  This is absolutely one of the worst foundations I've ever used.  Tried it with different primers, and skincare.  I could not make this work.  I am a professional with 20 years in the business and can usually make any foundation work  When I say save your money, I mean it. much better formulas at Sephora.  I have dry skin and in my 40s, but I tried it on my teenage daughter as well who has oily skin thinking it might have just been my skin type and age but no it is just a really horrible foundation.  idk if everyone is just such crazy Gaga fans that they don't care or what.  I love her music but this foundation is just not it.  I can't understand how it has so many good reviews and think that should be investigated to make sure house lab employees did make the reviews."

			"review_text": "First, the good things:  1. The color match for my skin was PERFECT. I’m fair neutral, which is a really hard shade to match, but the 040 is pretty much identical to my skin color.  2. From a distance, the foundation looks pretty nice. It doesn’t necessarily photograph well, but I’d say this is a decent choice for things like video calls/meetings or just going about day-to-day errands. (But for special events, I’d look for something a little better.)  Now the bad:  1. Up close, this foundation shows ALL of my texture issues. I honestly think I like my bare skin better than this, and that’s coming from someone who doesn’t have even color. I tried to see if maybe exfoliating right before my makeup routine would help, but no luck at all.  2. Smudges easily. If you accidentally touch your face (or someone else does), it’s going to be really clear exactly where it happened. I get easily frustrated with this and haven’t found a primer or setting solution that helps get rid of the issue with this foundation.  3. Feels unpleasant. You know how there are some foundations you put on on forget it’s there? This is not one of those. I don’t know if maybe it’s a personal skin sensitivity, but I can tell I have this foundation on all day and it leaves me feeling more uncomfortable than I’d prefer.   I’m glad I gave it a try, but the formula is just not for me. Nor is it really what I expected from the description and all of the reviews. With that said, don’t let this discourage you from the Luther Haus Labs products—in my case, the concealer is *exactly* what I was looking for!"

When I tell you… The shade to 30 is the only foundation in my entire life, that is my EXACT skin tone. I’ve literally never experienced anything like it in my entire life. Props to Lady Gaga and Haus. Labs for utilizing in developing such amazing technology. This is hands-down the best foundation I’ve ever used. I am not being dramatic.

I've figured out by a lot of testing that this product broke me out pretty badly.  I think it's all of the seed oils and fermented ingredients in this product - I'm really sensitive to fermented ingredients and while I've used arnica in the past, i guess fermented arnica is different.  I've looked for more information about how fermented arnica is made but Haus Labs seems to be the first company to use this ingredient and there is barely any info on it.

I ordered 260 initially, was nearly a perfect match ONLY AT FIRST, but got really dark after a few hours. I exchanged it for 230, which again had a nice undertone until hours later- it pulled more red on my skin and I could see a demarcation line on my neck so I went and got the 190. It’s a little light FOR ME but I can get away with it once it has set fully and I’ve bronzed/contoured to warm it up. All in all I don’t recommend doing online shade matching and definitely go to a store, swatch some shades AND WALK AROUND! WAIT FOR IT TO DRY, BEFOREEE deciding on a shade."

It did seem to set a little bit over time, but when I applied powder to give it a more matte finish, it removed the coverage and made the foundation blotchy and separate even more. I have been determined to make this work and have tried mixing it in with some of my other favorite matte foundations, which does help.   Bottom line, I will continue to use it as a base mixer in some of my truly matte foundations to balance out the finish and try to benefit from the skincare ingredients, but I will not be repurchasing."

On top of that, it clogs my pores after each use, and I get whiteheads all over my face. I’d say if you have absolutely perfect, flawless skin, give it a try. However, even then, I believe there are better options out there for a similar price."

The first thing I thought when I tried this was Where has this foundation been all of my life? Had this product been around years ago, it would have saved me so much hassle. This has medium, buildable coverage. It feels SO light and airy on the skin. The finish is natural and looks skin-like. Though I don't have near the amount of acne that I used to, I found that this didn't irritate the acne I currently have. Highly recommend!"

I wanted a better complexion makeup that would elevate my everyday look, but hated the thought of feeling weighed down by a full face of makeup.  I had explored some other foundations and tinted creams, but the Haus Labs concealer and foundation blew me away. Both products (when used together or separately) blend in so well, that they have a great blurring effect, and even after a full day's wear, they felt very lightweight. At first, having never done an online color-match quiz, I was skeptical about how my results would turn out... when I got my makeup in the mail, I was impressed at how well the colors matched my complexion and corrected discoloration. The fact that these products are clean and infused with 20+ skincare ingredients is just a bonus next to how well the product looks/works.   * note that while my product review is 100% authentic, I was gifted these products by Haus Labs"

Enter the Triclone Skin Tech Foundation by Haus Labs, what I would call the first true foundation breakthrough in years. While many others boast medium coverage, they tend to still be too heavy to blend or too light to cover blemishes, but not with this beauty. Triclone is a true, buildable, comfortable medium coverage that is customizable to your look and day. When I’m looking for that fresh glow, this adds to a beautifully hydrated complexion. If I’ve got more to cover, or looking for full glam, she’s also buildable and able to be layered accordingly. But, best of all, with continuous wear I have noticed my redness improving in general—without makeup—thanks to Triclone’s addition of tons of skincare benefits. It wears all day without feeling like I’m wearing anything at all, and that’s the type of makeup I want in my routine! I’ve gone through an entire bottle over the course of 6+ months, and happily on my second. She’s a staple! Thank you, Haus Labs! (Wearing shade 070 Fair Neutral)"

After a few hours of wearing these products with a very light amount of powder, blush and bronzer over top, It didn’t even feel like I had makeup on. These products aren’t heavy which I love! I typically don’t blend in my concealer with a brush, I normally prefer a sponge but this brush was perfect! I didn’t even have to use a sponge afterwards so continue blending into the skin. My before and after pictures show my skin with no product vs just the Haus Labs Foundation and concealer with no powder or anything over top. It’s clear that the foundation covers up my redness and some acne scarring and the concealer brightens up my under eyes in the perfect way! I absolutely love these products and I definitely recommend!😍❤️"

BUT the biggest no for me is… this is NOT for neutral or golden undertones. It’s just not no matter what shade it is.  It will oxidize pink or orange.  Believe me. I was color matched  SOOO many times.  That’s  the biggest let down. All the benefits don’t matter when no color matches you.  I’m a light medium neutral with golden undertones."

I don't notice any sort of smell or had any break outs (I have sensitive, acne prone skin). The packaging is also a luxurious, frosted glass. I wore this on one of the hottest days, 100+ temp with high humidity and this foundation did not melt or start clinging to my dry patches/texture. I wear this with Rare Beauty Illuminating primer and 4-in-1 setting mist. I set my undereyes with Elf Halo Glow setting powder in the pink shade. These photos have NO FILTER. It speaks for itself on how beautifully it lays on the skin"

I did the quiz on their website to match my shade, and I really appreciated that it not only asked about my skin tone/type, but what I wanted the foundation to do and my skin concerns. I am 45 and have combination skin. I was worried it wouldn't be enough coverage, but it is more than enough, controls shine, but still looks radiant and natural. I get so many compliments! I'm glad I took the shade matching quiz as the one I originally chose was off.,,make sure you do that if you have any doubt! A little of this goes a long way, I also use my beautyblender so I use less and get natural coverage. Worth the award winning reputation!"

I usually have a very hard time finding a good match (foundations pull yellow/orange on me), this one did not!! Finally no oompa loompa look! Haus labs bases their undertones on a real color wheel so keep that in mind while selecting your undertone, I did add a touch of the 350 cool shade just to make it 100% perfect since it seems I'm in between but as you can see, the result is perfection! This foundation is great for dry skin, I think it's because of its skin loving ingredients, I still prepped my skin just because it is my ritual. The formula is lightweight, literally couldn't feel I was wearing anything. The coverage is indeed medium, you can build it up or make it even lighter by using a beauty blender (perfect for the no makeup makeup days). It never settled on my fine lines, and, as you can see in pics, it didn't emphasize my texture and it wore nicely. I suggest to set it with a powder which meets your skin's needs.

I LOVE that it was formulated with skincare ingredients that benefit the skin, and the coverage is soooo great, especially as someone who has acne-prone skin. Another pro, is that the formula feels so light on the skin, even as someone who has oily/combo skin; this foundation doesn't make me look greasy, and it still looks like my skin! The longevity of the foundation wears really well, also, and I don't find it slipping or melting off throughout the day! Highly recommend to anyone who is looking for a foundation that is clean, looks like skin, and gives you that flawless my skin, but better finish!"

When I got home and tried it on...WHOA!  Too light.  So I went back and was matched to 130, which was better.  Talking with Sephora rep, she told me that what is described as warm is really cool and visa-versa.  Nutty.  Second, this foundation is thicker than I usually like.  I'm a medium coverage girl and don't like gloppy foundation.  This foundation is not gloppy, but is thicker than I'm used too.  That is personal preference.  Other than that, this foundation is fine, but not my favorite.  It is not horrible either."

You can see in second picture where it wouldn't cover some discoloration near my jawline. I had been wearing it for 3 hrs. It looked cakey where I tried building extra coverage, turned very orange, and lines and pores shown up unlike most other foundations. Very unattractive. I will be sending it back.

They are just a little too pink and neutral and not golden enough for me, where as Armani 4 is my perfect shade. I will probably still buy the 100 or 110 for this foundation but I hope there will be more undertones for this brand! Really amazing foundation, and btw, it has more of a makeup look/higher coverage than Armani. It will also be perfect for winter!

I'm 57 and am concerned about lines and wrinkles and this foundation on me starts out looking like it's going to settle in the lines but somehow within maybe a half hour of having it on it suddenly looks great. I do lightly set some areas with a good powder, but I do that with every foundation. I live in South Alabama and humidity is bad!

I have always had under eye circles and freckles which I have always been self conscious about. I’ve used every concealer from drug store brands to high end brands and I have to say Triclone Skin Tech concealer (01 Fair Neutral) is in the top 3 of my favorites. I love the applicator with it and the container is made so that you don’t get too much product each time. It is a thicker formula and goes on smoothly. The concealer brush is a must have as well! It is so soft and perfectly shaped (like a finger) to get in the hard to reach places (corner of eyes) and blends perfectly. It does not absorb a lot of the product either!  The Triclone Skin Tech Foundation (040 Fair Neutral) is a medium coverage but it is buildable. My go to foundation is full coverage (because of my freckles/dark spots). I used 3-4 pumps of the foundation and that was enough to conceal the majority of my freckles/dark spots! I have the foundation brush in my collection and love it as well. It is just the larger version of the concealer brush, very soft, designed great, and doesn’t absorb tons of the product! I would definitely recommend the concealer, foundation, and BOTH brushes!"

Foundation: 300 medium neutral   *i was gifted these products for my honest review  So I've been holding off on posting my review because i wanted to test out the skin care properties that these products profess to have and I'm so glad i did! For the past 3 weeks 5-6 days a week, I've been wearing these products for 9-14hours a day and i can honestly say that I've seen such an improvement to my skin.   I have eczema patches around my mouth and eyes which makes wearing products for extended periods of time difficult because it tends to start cracking and looking caking within the first 1-2hours. This is absolutely NOT the case with these products.   The foundation wears almost like a BB cream, you can go as sheer or as heavy as you'd like since it's so buildable. I chose to wear it very sheer most days but had a few days where i went heavier because i had speaking engagements at work and was going to be on camera. Very minimal cracking, it never felt cakey, and lasted ALL day long through many busy days. I'm not a huge fan of the pump but it's not a deal breaker for me."

It works best for me when I apply it right after my moisturizer and primer (I use Supergoop! Unseen Sunscreen), then set it was just a little powder. My only complaint is that it will still settle in a deeper forehead line that I have, no matter what I try. I have to go back a few minutes later and blend it out a little more which usually takes care of it for the day.

I was so excited to try this stuff knowing there is skin care ingredients in it and was actually good for my skin. I have combination skin— it gets very oily and also very dry so foundation has always been a struggle… but let me tell you… I LOVE this stuff. It looks so natural on and is not cakey at all. My favorite part is that I can wear it all day and night and it still feels like I don’t have any makeup on (normally I am dying to go home and wash my face after a couple hours of wearing a foundation). It still looks amazing after wearing it for hours as well. I love that it’s medium-buildable coverage so it is light and natural looking, but if you want great coverage you still have it!!!  One thing I have learned after trying different methods to apply it is that with my combination skin, it only looks smooth and non splotchy if I apply it with a brush and my skin is properly prepped (face is washed then moisturized). I have tried applying using my hands or a damp beauty sponge but it didn’t blend in with my skin as nice as using a brush. I also tried using my favorite primers but I found that it actually works better without a primer as long as your skin is freshly clean and moisturized.   I recommend this product to all my foundation-wearing friends and will continue to recommend to them. Once you try this stuff you won’t be able to use another foundation again!!!"

In the past I have consistently used Tarte Shape Tape Foundation, as well as Clinique Perfecting Foundation + Concealer.I will base my review as someone who has used the two mentioned foundations. I am now looking for products closer to a BB cream or lighter texture and I think this foundation is a great option for what I am currently looking for in the market. I feel that this makeup is a good middle ground for anyone looking for something that is full coverage but not cakey and is easy to blend. The way this foundation dries on your face is VERY smooth and gives you an airbrushed feeling. I did use my fingers while applying this product which I think really helped blend the foundation. This product is definitely worth the purchase. If you are on the fence I would try to go to Sephora and try to sample/test the foundation. I personally used the shade finder on Haus Labs website and the foundation that I selected after doing the foundation test was pretty accurate once I received the product and tried it on. If your skin tends to be dry as mine can sometimes be when applying all over makeup/foundation I would recommend a moisturizing primer with this foundation as I found this to not necessarily dry out my face but caused a slight dryness that was slightly itchy. I will most likely purchase this foundation again."

After applied, it feels weightless on the skin. It literally looks like my skin but better with just the right amount of coverage. I wear it everyday to work and it looks like my skin but better (and it lasts too!!). The key to perfect skin with this formula is to prime the skin with a silicone-based primer. It goes on incredibly smooth this way with no separation. This foundation is silicone-based so it makes sense.   On top of this being such a radiant, lightweight, and skin-like formula, it contains an array of skincare ingredients that I feel good about putting on my skin. I put this on every day so it’s gratifying to know that the foundation I’m using is also helping my skin on a daily basis rather than clogging it. My skin has never felt better."

I still believe the product is worth continuing to test to see if I can find the right process for me. That said, I tried multiple ways of applying and finishing it as I could to see if it fell on my application or skin versus the actual product. I tried countless combinations starting with applying with a sponge vs brush, multiple types of primers vs no primer, using concealer under the product, over the product, and both, as well as trying a finishing spray vs. powder vs both. Some observations I made were that it worked well with a powder or both, so I may have to try it with the blurring loose setting powder for optimal results. Also, the consistency of the foundation is very liquidy so a little goes a long way. One pump was all I needed to cover my face whereas I typically need 2 ½ to 3 pumps (so more bang for your buck). The texture is gentle and very soft and glides across the face easily. It doesn’t clump or feel suffocating on the face. I would say it works way better with a brush over a sponge (and if the foundation brush is anything like the concealer one, I need to get it). It does take a moment to dry down but that’s neither a pro or con for me. Additionally, if you have sensitive skin this is worth looking into. I didn’t have any reaction (redness or zits) after testing. Lastly one thing that sets this item apart and is a major pro for this product is the color match. I used the Haus Labs Shade Finder and it worked wonderfully. I truly was surprised at how well it matched to my skin. So, if you’re thinking about trying this product, I would definitely say give it a try and experiment with the application process. Make-up should be fun! 😊"

However, because it's so light and airy, it can (for me at least) get a little slippery or malleable, it doesn't cement to your face, which is why I would recommend this product for an everyday wear as opposed to a formal full face glam. It's easy breezy to touch up with minimal effort. But with a full face glam, I would prefer a foundation that STICKS, like it ain't budging, cemented to my skin type of foundation. With that being said, the fact this product is made with clean ingredients, and it's so much more light and breathable, I'm more inclined to reach for it in my everyday makeup routine. It's a lovely addition to any makeup counter. I was gifted this product in exchange for an honest review."

So I took the shade match quiz on their website and the one they send was a spot on match, I was so impressed like I was jumping for joy I’m not kidding. Anyway, the foundation is beautiful, not thick, not heavy, and the arnica really did help cause my skin didn’t feel itchy or angry when wearing it. The finish has a beautiful skin-like glow that is not shimmer, it’s just that hydrating. I can’t be more thankful for this foundation, it’s that amazing!"

It wasn't even warm outside which usually interferes with how your foundation performs but unfortunately I cannot recommend this even to my worst enemy.   So here's what I learned: get at least 3 shade samples, see how the shade you choose oxidizes and wear it for at least 3 hours.  Unfortunately, it's a hard pass for me but the skincare benefits did call me attention... which made me even more mad to find a pimple growing underneath the foundation when I washed my face!

It feels like skincare (and it technically is!) and offers buildable medium coverage if desired, but it can be thinned out on no-makeup makeup days. It's hydrating but not sticky/oily (even without powder, hair won't stick to your face!) and creases less than some of my other tinted moisturizers/foundations.

The shade 110 is very yellow, and there was an obvious difference between my face and neck/chest when I wore this. The worst thing about this foundation is how badly it emphasizes texture. If you have ANY amount of texture, and I mean, just even pores, it will emphasize them, and bring out things on your skin that you didn't even know was there. It also caked up around my mouth area, which hardly any foundation does. If you have perfect normal skin and no pores, then I can see this working for you, and providing a nice radiance, but if you have dry skin, I can see this bringing out dry patches. If you have oily skin like me, you will be an oily mess, and all your pores will look even bigger than normal. Do not recommend this foundation at all."

Also, because it's so dewy, it never feels like it dries down, so it feels tacky to the touch all day. Which is a shame, because if it weren't for that, this would be my perfect foundation.

If you prepped your skin with a matte primer/moisturizer, it would probably pull more matte. On me, it wore for a good 10 hours. I don’t touch up throughout the day so I can get a little shiny in the t-zone but that’s welcome as I lean dry.

PROS If you like a VERY dewy look, this is for you. There is AMAZING skin care formulated into the foundation including Arnica, which reduces redness SO well!  It feels weightless for being a full coverage foundation. If you use the color match on the HAUS labs website, there WILL be a shade in your color bc of all the options. BE SURE TO USE THE COLOR WHEEL ON THE HAUS LABS WEBSITE! NOT SEPHORA. Lasts longer than most other foundations CONS it takes FOREVER to dry down so you have to wait a solid 10 mins before applying any other products or else the foundation picks up. Unfortunately it does sink into pores so if you have large pores like me, you may not be satisfied.  The transfer, omgggg the transfer is bad 😫 If you have oily skin, you’re gonna wanna buy a decent setting powder bc even after it dries down which it doesn’t seem to do well, the oil returns but worse. The colors of the foundation are opposite in names than the normal foundation shade names… it’s annoying. So if you’re cool toned, you need to pick a warm tone. Frustrating for sure.  It’s THICK…. It may feel weightless if you use one layer and don’t but up, but bc it’s so thick, going in for more coverage just lifts the first layer.  I hope my experience helps you in your decision because nobody wants to spend that much money on something they can’t use!"

My skin does not tolerate heavy or goopy full coverage foundation. I love the texture of this foundation and the fact that it covers my redness. I wear my foundation for 12-14 hours a day. My only critique is that is can sometimes get patchy across my forehead but I see that most if I didn’t prime my skin well enough. I apply with both a beauty blender and a brush. Either works well for me.  My skin looks great all throughout my day. HIGHLY recommend! My photos below are without makeup and then foundation.  The shade I use is 220."

It does sit on top of the skin if not prepped correctly, but I feel like that happens with most foundations for me. I prefer to wear this foundation with no powder to keep the glowy finish. I would suggest going to the store and trying on the shades for a good match - the shade match system is a bit tricky and it was difficult for me to pick a shade based on their descriptions alone.

The wear is beyond impressive. I am a sweaty girl and tend to get very oily throughout the day. I follow a full skincare routine (wash, essence, vit c, moisturizer, SPF), and always worry about pilling, product compatibility or oxidation. I follow my usual routine, allowing products to dry in between steps, and then apply a makeup primer. I have applied this foundation with my fingers and also a wet and dry makeup sponge. The finish is flawless and luminous with those applications, and I layered concealer, powder and setting spray for an all-day look. I am on my third bottle and only go in for touch ups during the day if I did not first apply primer or finish with a setting spray. I love a full face, and use about 3-4 pumps for full coverage (I know don’t judge me). I believe having hydrated skin will help the overall wear/look of this silky foundation. It doesn’t feel heavy, and offers an elevated natural look. I’m on my third bottle and counting."

The most important, amazing feature that shouldn't be ignored is what it does to your skin. I have very fair skin with rosacea, and finding a color match is tough. I have used Lancome' Teint idole sticks in beige ivory (210) for years. It is a perfect match. However, I am now 43, and it doesn't set on my skin as flawlessly as it once did...my pores are getting larger, and that is just life. I got a color match at the store, and it matched my neck, but I looked like a corpse and went up one level with something a bit more golden. It isn't perfect at first but settles nicely. But what is most shocking is that my rosacea is almost gone. I have tried everything to treat it, and after using this the past couple of months, my skin is glowing. It is the only thing I have changed. My teenage son told me I looked younger, and I was barefaced. I think the dark circles under my eyes have faded, and the skin around my eyes looks less puffy. so, sure, the color is a teensy bit less than perfect, but it had made my skin look amazing. I did NOT expect that at all. I should give it a 4.5 because of the color, but the magic it did to my skin makes it deserve a 5. I guess it is the niacinamide? I also found that coverage was better when I applied with my hands and not an applicator."

I have a lot of variants in my skin tone, and lot of redness/sun damage on my forehead and it blends in beautifully. If you want a dewy, moisturized look, and you want your skin to look like skin, this is a great foundation for those things. I will say that I think the way they categorize their colors/undertones does not align with most other brands. According to this foundation, I’m a cool undertone, but when I wear cool toned products from other brands, they look washed out and don’t blend with the foundation well. I’ve seen other people say that this shade works for their olive/warm tones. So keep that in mind. I swatched this in store, and I think it’s an okay match. The shade range is extensive enough, that I feel confident I could find a perfect shade. So I highly recommend, it just might take some finessing to find your actual match. For that reason I took away a star. In the images I attached, I only have this shade applied. You’ll see where it matches and where it doesn’t, but it’ll give you a good idea of the finish."

Its been a little streaky/flakey on me the last few times but that's just because my skincare routine needs tweaking. It's a little tacky for the first couple minutes, similar to a tinted moisturizer, but it settles into a nice satin finish. The product is on the runnier side but not so much so that it's messy. I use my ULTA foundation blending bush. 4 stars just because I think there should be slightly more product for the price.  *** this particular combo included: - Rare Beauty Illuminating Primer - Rare Beauty undereye brightener - JS Cremated Palette - E.L.F halo cream countour - Bare minerals Mineral Veil - Rare Beauty illuminating setting mist"

This foundation is the closest to a perfect seamless application I've been looking for. It's very buildable, molds right into your skin, stays on,  isn't patchy.  My only critique is that shades do lean very yellow. I have neutral undertone and even with color IQ and after trying on multiple shades in the store, my foundation looks quite yellow compared to my natural tone. I probably should've gotten a cool version, but based on the reviews, I'm not sure it's make a big difference.

It’s perfect for summer in this shade and the texture really does feel like a second skin. I don’t even have to wear concealer with this foundation, and that’s pretty fab because I’ve never been able to use a foundation as a concealer in a pinch. Pro’s: lightweight, long-lasting, radiant, and greatly minimizes wrinkles (I’m 48). Con’s: it can be drying a bit, so I really have to prepare + prime my skin well for a flawless finish. I use Bobbie Brown’s enriched primer. This is a photo of me wearing the foundation with all Dior makeup. It was a very humid, summer evening and we’d been out on a restaurant porch and out for cocktails for 4-5 hours. I was impressed with how well it lasted without touch ups or setting powder — I forgot it on vacation. With my Givenchy Prisme Libre 3 Viole Rosé, all my fine lines around my eyes and mouth are completely blurred and the effect is gorgeous together. I’m curious to try the Haus Lab Setting Powder too, but now I’m happy using what I have and love. I highly recommend that you really prepare and prime your skin well; find your best shade; and using a setting powder you love to get the full effect. I love my faithful Dior foundation but this is the perfect summer foundation to stand up against the heat and humidity without the heaviness of a matte foundation. So happy my bestie talked me into trying this! Love it!"

After having seen so many people rave about this I was super excited to try it. A few people mentioned that it didn’t settle into lines/wrinkles. I’m 46 so I definitely have them. I felt that the foundation sat pretty decent in my fine lines and wrinkles, it did settle in them but was not super noticeable. I do enjoy the finish of the foundation, it’s not a flat matte and I wouldn’t call it super dewy either, I guess more like a satin. Ultimately I ended up decluttering this only weeks after Pur ha cuz overall it does not sit on my skin well. I have combo skin. This foundation doesn’t sit smoothly and evenly on my skin. I had odd patches where the foundation clung. At first I thought maybe I just needed to exfoliate and tweak my skincare. No matter what I did I had odd patches where it clung. It didn’t wear well on my nose at all, within an hour it looked patchy and not good. Also it didn’t go on evenly in general. I don’t know how to explain it other than it was like blotchy, but fine blotches. This happened no matter what skincare or primer I used. It got more noticeable in the areas I set with powder……and yes I tried multiple of those too. Unfortunately this product just isn’t for me."

Definitely my new holy grail foundation. For someone who suffers from dry and oily skin, this stuff is great especially with the added skincare ingredients. The color does oxidize after being on so I would definitely say to swatch in stores, but with the right primer and a good moisturizing routine this stuff looks beautiful on the skin!  My only real complaints are it looks a little shiny for my liking and needs to be LIGHTLY powdered down, and that if you wear glasses it will sadly move the foundation around where the nose pads rest. Otherwise I'm really happy with it and it's the only replacement I've found for fenty hydrating foundation that comes anywhere close to being hydrating and fuller coverage."

Overall makes your skin looking better and as natural as a thin layer of foundation can do. Coverage is light - softens redness, will leave a uniform appearance but won’t cover dark spots or blemishes. Yes, formula is thin and blends like a charm so you can build up but won’t get to a full coverage level (if you’re someone that actually have skin issues to cover, don’t rely on that). Also if you build, it will settle into lines. I have bad melasma in my forehead and it softens but don’t even get closer to cover it. The more you apply, the more it enhance dryness and patches… definitely won’t recommend to build up over trouble areas - go for a full coverage foundation that covers everything with a single layer!). My other concern is that it doesn’t last on my skin, no matter what - and I don’t usually have lasting problems with my foundations. It’s definitely not a formula to use on your wedding day or whatever event you need your foundation last. And, regarding shades, although I appreciate the high range, and bought twice in the store, I found so difficult to find a good match - Sephora lights don’t help either! I normally buy neutral tones but all neutral seemed kind of too warm. And cool tones seems ashy… warms are way too warm… foundation is good but not worth all the hype."

			"review_text": "I typically have a hard time with foundations, because they are either too orange, heavy, or make me break out. This is the first foundation I've used where I am confident in the shade match and not worried that I'm going to have break outs when I remove it. It lasts all day, even on the days when I am in a rush and forget to apply primer. I have combo skin so super oily on my t-zone and dry every where else. I think the powder you choose with it matters A LOT. When I first started using it, I was using Laura Mercier and I was super oily by 10AM (2 hours after application). Now, I use the One-Size loose powder, and this combination is THE BEST. I start getting dewy around 2PM, but its a good dewy not dewy to where I look like I could use the oil to fry a chicken on a skillet. When I get out of work at 5:30pm my base still looks AMAZING.(I work inside,so I am not sure how it would last if I was always outside)  I think its also really important to ensure your skin is prepped well beforehand, because it'll allow the foundation to sit really beautifully. I also feel like this foundation has healed my skin in a way. Before I was always breaking out in rashes underneath my eyes and constantly had acne. Now, I have small hormonal breakouts here and there, but I haven't broken out into a rash under my eyes, and if I have a small breakout, after I wear the foundation, it has reduced or gone away. I am not sure how, but I swear it has healed my skin. The only thing about this foundation is that its medium coverage, so if you have really stubborn acne it will not cover it alone. However, I have lupus, rosacea, and acne-prone skin so my face is naturally always red, and this foundation covers the redness completely compared to a skin tint that will not cover it at all. I also never leave reviews, but I really love this foundation so much, and I hope it can help someone else like me with similar skin conditions."

I applied with a damp beauty blender and it made my skin gorgeous and dewy without being too slippy. The coverage is perfect for me, and actually buildable unlike most. 1 layer gives you slightly more coverage than a skin tint. 2 layers is more medium to full coverage. Super extra bonus that this has calming skincare ingredients as well. Seriously if you have rosacea or dryness or both go buy this right now before I propose and take it off the market."

Jahala at my local Sephora matched me with the 230.  I couldn't believe how natural it looks. I was extremely surprised that this foundation didn't oxidize either, which most foundation do that one me, which is why I stuck with one for so long.  I just wanted to write a review, because if you are in your 40s, with extreme combination skin, and are looking for a natural finish, lightweight foundation with a medium coverage, that won't budge on extreme heat and humidity look no further, because this one is it.

It's better under a silicone pore blurring primer but then even with that I was STILL patchy.  PROS: - wide shades selection  CONS: - colour is still weird. I'm a neutral asian skin tone but the neutral (110) pulled yellow on me. So I got the neutral w/ peach undertones (100) and even that was yellow. Very confused bc I'm def not cool-toned, my veins are a blueish green. So be careful w/ colour. i was matched in store and still it was not good. - melts and becomes patchy while simultaneously drying? - applying w/ her recommended brush made it SO THICK. I ended up using fingers. - gives me wrinkles I don;t have - clings to every acne pock mark and makes me look 20 years older  I'm attempting to make my mom use it bc her skin is perfect.

They kind of released this in the middle of the skin tint range which was a gamble but I’m glad it seems to have attracted the audience it deserves.   I’m a sheer-low medium coverage fan and prefer thinner serum like textures to whips, mousses and creams. I prefer to apply base products with a brush and a beauty sponge and I like being left with a satin finish. This product delivers on all of that. This is truly a high performing foundation worthy of the price tag. It has performed well with anything I’ve paired it with and layers up beautifully without a trace of heaviness.   I can see this working for most skin types. I think the oiliest of skins should probably opt for something else since the finish is satin right from the start and the formula itself is quite hydrating. The shade selection is wonderful, any shade I’ve swatched in-store has looked natural. This is one where you’re likely not going to want to blind buy as the descriptions are old-school in the way that MAC is. I normally wouldn’t opt for something with “peach” in the description but the shade works well.    I would highly recommend this and this is one of the best launches in recent memory."

I only used 2 pumps and blended with my beauty blender - I am sure you can use your fingers and will definitely try this method next. With only two pumps, you get a natural finish that will even out your skin. If desired, this formula is buildable so you can achieve a medium coverage. This is a foundation that I can wear daily.

SHADES: If you're a light-medium neutral finding a lot of the shades too warm like I was, 160 Light Neutral might be your play. It took me 6 months to finally find my shade after 175, 145, even 110 was too dark & saturated, but it was worth it!!

I never would’ve put myself in the “cool” category but it matches my skin and undertone near perfectly! I found that other foundations that just “sit” on my skin and feel like another layer after a while of applying. I’d always feel uncomfortable wearing them, but this feels exactly like skin. 👍🏾 I haven’t had a foundation feel this good and not cakey or orange with the wrong undertones.

I wear glasses and after about 3-4 hours wearing this foundation AND setting it, the foundation had COMPLETELY rubbed off where my glasses sit, i understand a little bit but my bare skin was fully visible. It was separating all over my face and settling into creases I didn’t even know I had. I take care of my skin thoroughly, but I guess this one is not for oily skinned people.

For reference; I'm a fair-skinned neutral undertone with a slightly more yellow hue than pink. I wouldn't have blind bought 040 Fair Neutral online just because of how PINK it looks, even with different screen settings. I ended up swatching it in-store and it definitely came out slightly more yellow and appears to be a spot-on match. Once again, the formula itself lives up to the hype, but do not trust the colors as they appear on the site. You definitely need to test these shades in store before you buy.  Even holding my bottle up to the image, I can see a stark difference. It is definitely more yellow than porcelain IRL."

			"review_text": "I couldn't figure out why this was so polarizing - people absolutely LOVE it or it's the worst foundation ever.  But now that I've used it for a few weeks, I understand why.  It wins the Oscar for best Special effects and Best Actress but it doesn't win for Best Picture overall: - If you have normal or combo skin it will be beautiful on.  Skin-like and dewy perfection BUT I can see that this would be a mess on oily skin and it does cling to dry patches.  - If you have textured skin this probably isn't for you because it kind of emphasizes texture because of the 'glow factor'.   - It's tricky to set - the beauty of this product is in just application of the product itself, so if you use a setting powder, it takes away the finish, which is the whole point of this product. To prevent it from settling into creases, I now go in to the sides of my nose and around my mouth with a small feathery brush with the lightest setting powder imaginable, instead of a big pouffy brush like before. Tedious. -If you have discoloration (like a scar or a vein) this doesn't give the coverage you'll need and IT'S NOT BUILDABLE so you'll have to go in with concealer.  Fine if it's one or two spots, but time consuming and defeats the purpose if more than that. - It lasts pretty but not as long as others.  Overall I personally love this foundation, the finish is extraordinary, but it's as if this foundation works best on people who don't really need to wear foundation, lol.  Any issues at all turns this foundation into a labor of extra steps to making it work.  I bought this in 160 and normally use Estee Lauder Double wear in 2W2 Rattan, and the color is spot on.  However, double wear is a more user-friendly, universal problem solver as far as foundations go.  I will buy Haus Labs again because the finish is the VERY best I've ever put on, but I may also keep a spare bottle of double wear handy for when I'm in a rush or for the times my skin is acting up."

There are 2 fair cools, 2 fair neutrals, and 2 fair warms. I noticed duplicate names in the darker shades too. I get that they have the numbers, but that’s odd. They also don’t match up well with each shade, imo. My skin tone is fair neutral, and in this I’m 050 fair cool. I don’t have any “golden peach” undertones in my skin at all…and that describes a warm tone, right? The names and descriptions are all backwards lol. I highly recommend trying shades in store!!"

I didn't have to constantly re-touch my makeup as my day went on which is really unusual since I am a chef.  I can't decide which one looks better between this one and the Double Wear tho, That has been a staple in my routine for years; so the fact that I am reaching for this one more speaks volumes. I am a full-face everyday girly, and this is such a superior product.  Highly recommend this foundation. One downside is this isn't full coverage, but it does build up well; if you overdo it - it will settle into fine lines over the day - but it's makeup; that's what makeup does. Overall I will re-purchase once gone, and already ordered my sister one for her wedding day makeup kit! This was everything I was hoping for when the launch came out."

I gave it plenty of chances, using it over sunscreen and/or moisturizer, on a bare face, with a primer, without a primer, different brands and different types of primers (including a water-based one, thinking I was possibly incorrect to believe this was silicone-based foundation), applying it with my fingers, with a damp, then a dry blending sponge, with a make-up brush, and both with and without setting powder and sprays...it all revealed the same disappointing result.  I gave it every opportunity because I love(!!) the way it looks when I first put it on; their claims of skin-like is bang on, and it has decent coverage (even for someone with a frustrating combination of sun damage/dark spots and active, red breakouts).

I use one pump on my entire face. I also had to find skincare that worked with the foundation. Clinique 72 hr moisturizer did not work out well nor did the Glow Recipe toner. It dries pretty fast and looks like skin. I have rosacea and mature skin (35) and it covers it without feeling over done and fake. I don't set it with anything right now and it looks the same at the end of the day - even wear it to the gym after work and looks amazing.

Both a damp beauty sponge and setting spray separates it. I also have to it use it very sparingly around a deeper forehead line because it’ll very noticeably settle.

I either have to LOVE the product and it is life-changing, or I have to let consumers know how poor the product is, and not to spend their money.   Give this a try, but make sure your skin is moisturized before applying!"

			"review_text": "I've been using this for almost a month now, & this is what I think of it.  Pro's:  1.) Looks like skin  2.) Feels like nothing is on 3.) Isn't heavy/Airy feel. 4.) Sticks to my skin like glue  Cons:  1.) Complicated shade range (warm is cool, cool is warm, & neutral is yellow)  2.) Not as hypoallergenic as to be believed (broke me out instantly however not in a painful way)  3.) Expensive  Now, although I like this foundation, the shade that I had help with finding, was completely off course. Neutral is too yellow. The whole finding your right shade is anxiety driven, & frustrating. My skin isn't used to wearing complexion products, so although it broke me out I'm not going to drive the nail through the coffin for just that. It could be just my skin getting used to something new on my face. However, if you have sensitive skin be cautious, as all people with sensitivity are different. The shade range & price is the main reason why a star is knocked off, as foundation shades should be more reasonably easy to find, & not complicated when there's already enough of that with other brands. So that was disappointing. However, I did enjoy how it felt on my face, but I am going to need to buy like 3-4 more shades to experiment with in order to find the right one eventually. This is a very expensive foundation as well, so at the end of the day, it's up to you whether it is worth it or not. Me personally, I wouldn't mind buying this again, but I wouldn't buy it all the time though. Don't completely love it, but I certainly don't hate it. It's a balanced likable product."

I prepped my skin, applied CT setting spray and tower 28 setting spray before and after n also used HB setting powder. it's a perfect match and as it wears it looks better and better ... must have. and everything I do use it my skin likes it since it has good ingredients"

Very beautiful! I have noticed usinng a cream sunscreen and cerave moisturizer makes this product look great.I have combination-skin and what I noticed is that if my skin is too dry or oily this product tends to be a little meh. Definitely looks best on more moisturized skin. Another problem is that tou need to not use too much product, and one pump will actually be plenty for the face and neck. My final verdict is when it’s good it’s great and when it’s bad it’s patchy."

I am so obsessed with this foundation, I can't even explain it, but I will try.   upon first application I worried it ran a touch too yellow, but then I realized throughout the day that it was actually a perfect match. It seemed as though it was going to be anything but transfer proof when I first applied it, because it did feel so moisturizing and wet. there is a dry down for it and what it is dried down, honey, it does not budge! I never feel throughout the day like I have product on my face.   the skin care ingredients are moisturizing and my skin feels great! I used to use the Fenty ease drops for my daily foundation but it transferred all over the place and was far too matte and drying for the winter.   I've never had an easier time blending a foundation before this one and the finish it has on the skin is exceptional. It doesn't look like you're wearing anything at all. The coverage is medium to light and it easily covers redness without leaving that full coverage look. I don't think I'll ever use anything else ever again!"

I have extremely dry skin but I don't find that it clings to my dry spots (which I do currently have). Come into Sephora to get your shade matched because it is genuinely so difficult to get a shade match online. Also, I feel like the undertones for these foundations are more yellow but it blends in with my skin after applying even if it looks yellow at first? It hasn't made me break out and I have extremely sensitive skin and have been wearing it for a couple of days now. All in all, I do recommend this foundation if you are looking for a nice quality, good coverage and moisturizing foundation. I work long 8 hour shifts and it stays on all day after setting. The foundation bottle is really nice and a small amount of product covers a good amount of my face. It is definitely worth the price ( at least for me)."

I honestly can't speak on whatever Arnica technology this claims to have because I'm no scientist but I CAN tell you that when I have pimples this seems to calm them down and make them improve!  The only cons about this that I can find are that the shade range is super wonky (the neutrals lean pretty yellow and don't even get me started on the cool and warm stuff) and this does transfer a bit if you don't set it. Take your time picking out your correct shade, set it lightly with a powder you trust and it'll be your new best friend.   10/10 never buying another foundation again."

			"review_text": "I had high hopes for this foundation based on social media influence and the ingredients. And I have other Haus Labs cosmetics that I do love! Pro: It goes on nice and blends seamlessly with your skin initially. The online shade description was highly accurate. Cons: It separates throughout the day and highlights pores. For me it also caused a strange allergic reaction where my eyes became red and watery (I did not get in in my eyes). I tried it intermittently 3x to make sure it was the foundation causing the reaction and it 100% was. The eye irritation would begin immediately after application and would stop shortly after removing it. I am returning this foundation and will stick to my Bare Minerals powder foundation that I have been using for nearly a decade!"

No matter what foundation I use I always need to blot and powder throughout the day, this one was no different but that doesn’t bother me. Even when I had to do touch ups I never had to retouch the actual foundation. I’m VERY fair skin and was super excited to have a perfect shade match."

Wide range of colors, super natural-looking formula, can be applied as a thin layer or heavier for a full glam look. It’s almost like a serum-based formula; it feels really nice on my skin. Applied best with a brush, in my opinion. Even the cashier at the register said it’s the best foundation out right now. I’ve found my new routine foundation. Way to go Lady Gaga!"
