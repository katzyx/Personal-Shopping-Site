So even though it was more expensive than what I was using I decided to go ahead and get it. It is totally worth it to me. My skin feels so much softer and looks smoother.

Once empty, I can think of dozens of ways to repurpose such a gorgeous container, and I greatly appreciate the use of such sustainable packaging!

The ceramides and squalene really perform as intended, they sink into the skin without leaving it feeling tacky or shiny. If you find that it's not absorbing the way you would like it to, I definitely recommend using a gentle chemical exfoliant to remove any dead skin and with it obstacles to the cream reaching deeper. It's perfect for a fall to winter (and all winter long) transition to a heavier hitting formula that will defend against the dryness and effects of the colder season, the especially in climates with more extreme weather."

The blend of biomimetic ceramides and lipids truly supports my skin barrier, helping retain moisture throughout the day. Iu2019ve tried many face creams, but this one has quickly become my #1 choice for intense hydration and skin repair. Highly recommend it to anyone looking for a cream that lives up to its promises!"

It truly seeps into your skin and hydrates deep inside. It is a bit on the pricier side. This product does ethically produce their squalene which usually comes from sharks. If ethical products are important to you and you can afford this moisturizer, I absolutely recommend."

The first thing I noticed was the creamu2019s rich, luxurious texture. Itu2019s deeply hydrating without feeling heavy, and it absorbs well into the skin, leaving a soft, velvety finish.  What stands out the most about this cream is its formulau2014packed with squalane, omega fatty acids, and ceramides, which work together to nourish and repair the skin barrier. After using it consistently, my skin feels noticeably more hydrated, plump, and less prone to dryness and flakiness. Itu2019s also free of parabens, synthetic fragrances, and other potentially irritating ingredients, which is great for my sensitive skin.  This product has become a lifesaver during colder months when my skin is extra dry, but I think it would be suitable for anyone dealing with dehydration or seeking a more radiant, resilient complexion. While it is a bit on the pricier side, I find the results make it worth it, especially if youu2019re looking for a gentle, effective solution to tackle dryness and strengthen your skin barrier."

So I used to use this product before the brand filed for bankruptcy and ever since then I've noticed the quality is really bad.I do not trust this brand.The texture is like goopey sticky shaving cream. Every time I order the large size I believe they fill the top with hyaluronic acid to  fake the 100ml once that goopey stuff goes away you are left with less than half the jar filled with cream. Shady business. I wish they would just make this a dense cream and stop trying to make it hydrating and lighter it actually feels worse and dries out your skin and the inconsistency of the formula creates irritation. I get super itchy and red and the product pills. They should have kept the original consistency of a rich dense cream. A little product used to go a long way and it really helped with my dry sensitive skin. It seems like brands are reformulating and they are all starting to be the same consistency. Theres a purpose of having different types of products. They even have a gel version so im not sure why they think having goopey sticky gel would appeal to everyone..I also read on reddit a lot of people are buying the hand cream which is more moisturizing and only 15 bucks..seems like the brand doesnt know how to keep their audience or create a rich moisturizing cream anymore."

Super moisturizing and for the driest sensitive skin. The new formula, although the same ingredients, it is not the same consistency. It is severely watered down. They changed it to be a more hydrating product and melt in the skin no shine feels like nothing whats the point of spending 80 bucks to have a face that is drier than u began with. Yes its plumping but no moisture at all.. It used to be a rich cream that had some humectant properties now it melts into literally water. what they dont understand is too much gylcerine and hyaluronic acid and not enough emolliance causes ur skin to DRY OUT and pull water OUT! Because of this, you have to reapply and that is what irritated my skin. Dried it out and i ended up having to get hydrocortisone shots in my eye lid. if u have DRY skin do not get this. I have no idea why you guys dont buy ur gel formula tik tok brands glow recipe teenage brands and stop ruining the products for us dry skin sensitive types. ugh"

I was skeptical, but I actually really like this repair cream for its super moisturizing ability (and isn't greasy!). The first time wearing it, I got compliments on my skin. In the reviews here people have noted the smell. They're not wrong -- there is an initial whiff that's unpleasant when you first apply. It smells like Maker's Mark bourbon whiskey, which I always thought smelled like feet. It could be the shea butter. The scent goes away fast, though. This product actually has ten main ingredients in common with Augustinus Bader's The Cream (also smells like Maker's Mark) and for that reason alone I know that this formula is a good one. Augustinus Bader products are the best there are, but $230 for 50mL of moisturizer isn't in reach for me. This is a good alternative. 4 stars because I probably will keep shopping around after I run out, but it think this is a great product for the price."

I canu2019t stand that slimy suffocated feeling. Makes me cringe. I saw in a previous review that this cream worked for someone with sensory issues and they were right!

I also woke up with extremely dry lips, which was not normal for me. I washed my face in the night, and I only applied this cream, and I felt my face start to flare up and burn I looked at my skin closely and saw red flared bumps around my face and jaw line. It was really painful, and I ended up having to put an ice pack (after I washed my face). I applied a healing ointment, but I was still very uncomfortable. I woke up to a swollen face and really swollen lips, as well as itchy eyes.  I was a tatcha girl for many years, and I wanted to try something new!

I noticed people saying it smells like feet, fish, bad, etc. It is an algae product; I would say it has an oceanesque smell, but it fades right away. I personally donu2019t mind it, and prefer it over fragrant smells. I got the smallest size as a points reward before purchasing the full size, so maybe wait for that if you arenu2019t sure about the full size.   Donu2019t buy this product if: you like mattefying products, this isnu2019t for you - it has a shiny appearance. If you have oily skin - I have dry skin and love it; not sure how it would work for oily skin because it does have an oil-shine to it. If you really dislike ocean smells."

Yes, it smells like an aged soft cheese however, the smell dissipates quickly. I cannot smell it once I have blended the moisturizer completely into my skin. Initially I was very very nervous, my skin ATE this up. For about a week it seemed like my skin was a just sucking it up and I was watching a very quick demise of a very expensive product. I was not happy, but after several days my skin sort of balanced and I had to use a bit less. It was an interesting development; the temperature here has been consistently cold with no humidity to speak of, so I know my skin is the affecting variable.  I donu2019t know yet if it is worth the money, but it plays nice with my expensive layering products and my skin seems to like it. While it is not as occlusive as I like for my night moisturizer, I will continue to use it for a good makeup base; it leaves my skin just slightly tacky enough to make my tinted moisturizer glide over the top perfectly."

I find it is usually too heavy for summer, but as I live in the pacific northwest it works great as a night time moisturizer the rest of the year. I also use it during the day in winter if I am especially dry, however I only do so on no make up days as it doesn't work the best under make up imo. This is totally a night cream though despite it not specifying so, so I honestly don't expect it to look great under make up.   I find it works best if you have some kind of water based serum underneath that you let dry first, as the thick formula of the moisturizer helps lock in the hydration. It does a good job on it's own don't get me wrong, but if you pair it with a nice serum the combo effect is even better.   Absolutely love that there is a value size now. I share my skin care with my partner and the value size lasted us almost all winter."

I don't know if it'll work so well in the summer months, it may be too heavy, but for winter it's a-m-a-z-i-n-g! It somehow feels perfectly light, rich, and nourishing at the same time. A little goes a long way. My skin is just so plump and balanced after using this! It doesn't leave me looking or feeling greasy or shiny at all. It actually almost makes my skin look matte, but without any of the dullness or dryness.  I don't remember now if there was any fragrance in the ingredients list, but I don't notice a scent one way or the other.

I went through probably 10 different moisturizers;  some that are just popular online, and some known to be effective for helping the concerns that I had.  This was the only one that checked all my boxes.  It helped my redness, calmed the dryness, and even aided in clearing up my acne (along with salicylic acid).   As mentioned in nearly every review, no, it doesnu2019t smell great.  It isnu2019t heavily fragranced like many popular moisturizers are, and one of the things in it likely produces the odd smell.  For some, this is an automatic deal breaker.

The bigger issue for me is that this cream is supposed to be great for dry skin but in reality it just sits on top of your face without absorbing. Sure, it might provide some protection by creating a barrier from the elements, but it doesn't help replenish moisture. If you try to put sunscreen or foundation over top of it they'll pick up the moisturizer and you end up with little pilled up balls of sunscreen/foundation mixed with the moisturizer that you have to wipe off meaning if you want to wear sunscreen or makeup you end up having to take off the moisturizer you just put on.

So, I thought why not get a sample to experience the glory of these cream.  Very mild smell, and doesn't really have a very creamy texture at all, it oddly felt like putting on a dry cream. It certainly also felt like that on the face as well. While I will say it felt the same all day/ all night, it just doesn't have that nice ultra soft silky plumping texture or feeling that I want creams to give me - especially a repair cream. I'm not looking for greasy, tired of the whole slugging trend, you will never catch me putting petroleum on my face. But it just didn;t make my skin feel like it was being revitalized through the entire time I used it. I was comparing it to a Paula's choice Antioxidant Enriched Natural Moisturizer and First Aid Beauty Intensive Repair Cream, and both of them left me feeling so well moisturized and after all day or waking up after sleeping with either of these creams on, I had that same softness and plumped feeling. I just never found it with this cream, it feels lifeless. I even have a $10 moisturizer (from Korea) and that does the trick immensely better than this cream. Seeing how expensive this brand is and how much people sing praise about it all the time, I was severely disappointed and don't intend to test out anything else buy them. I would not throw it out but I am certainly not even going to choose it over the numerous good and much cheaper repair cream options that are already out there doing it better."

It certainly is not apparent after it has been applied. Unbelievable nit-picking. This is a great moisturizer that does the job period. You can buy a cheaper sweet-smelling moisturizer that does a crappy job if smell is what you are after. Personally, I like a moisturizer that does a good job at.....moisturizing. This isn't the perfume counter."

Honestly, it's great to have on hand to pamper your face! The scent is very light, almost like a weak tea, though if you are more  sensitive to scents, you may find it more harsh.

It manages to be rich but light, nourishing but easily absorbed.  For me it is a great summer moisturizer for day and night.  Just a smidge in the morning wears well under makeup.  I can go a little heavier at night.  During the winter I would probably layer this up with an oil to combat dry winter skin.  So glad I tried this!"

I also deal with texture and breakouts and this month I havent had to deal with any of that. For the most part this is unscented. It does have a natural plant smell but itu2019s very light.

Since it is summer time and it is quite hot, i tend to use it a couple of times per week in my night time routine. It works great, and although i have noticed that my newly appeared fine lines are smoothing, i think i need to use it a bit more often. It will be a great staple in my autumn/winter routine, since it is a very rich cream! All in all, ABSOLUTELY LOVED IT! Highly recommend!"

I really like that it doesnu2019t have a overly fragrance in the product . I think sometimes it takes away from its benefits ( just my opinion) . My skin is sensitive and it didnu2019t cause any allergic reaction . It really moisturized the skin which I enjoy applying it mostly at night and sometimes during the day if I used an acid or a retinol the night before . It is a cross of drunk elephant and Kate Somerville moisturizer . I do wish that the one I got had a spatula to get it out of the jar . Still Iu2019m being picky about it and it is still a great product . Loved it so much that I got a back up  . Seriously recommend for anyone who is serious about there skin care and that is allergic to fragrance like me .   This product was send for free by influencer to give my full honest review ."

A little goes a long way.   I was a little afraid that it would be too heavy for my skin in the warmer weather, but it is excellent.  My combination skin really loves this cream.  The only negative that I can think of is the smell.  It is fragrance-free which I love, but the scent of the cream is slightly off-putting.  It doesn't bother me enough to take off a star as I really like that it doesn't have fragrance.  I will repurchase it as soon as I run out."

The texture of my skin does look smoother for my acne scars on my cheeks but the crater acne scars and large pores are still visible and I havenu2019t seen it heal those area yet.

I suffer from dry skin or more over, dry patches that tend to catch my makeup and make it look less than ideal. I started using just this moisturizer in the morning and then at night using this moisturizer and then using Biossance 100% Squalane oil on top.

Itu2019s a thick cream and does seem quite hydrating when itu2019s on but honestly Iu2019m just not seeing the amazing results that other reviewers are. My bare skin still feels very rough. My pores are huge on my forehead and Iu2019m breaking out a lot, which I donu2019t necessarily think is due to this cream, but Iu2019m breaking out beyond the usual places and they take forever to go away/heal if they even do. I think this just isnu2019t the cream for me. I also hate the smell of it. I like that itu2019s packaged in a glass jar, but that does make it quite heavy if youu2019re carrying it with you. I might just set this aside to use only at night or in the fall. But I am unlikely to purchase this product."

I have combination skin and this worked great as my nighttime moisturizer, as I like to apply more of a rich cream at night. It leaves my skin super hydrated and plump the next morning. What I really like is that there isnu2019t any synthetic fragrance or essential oils that are added, so it is completely fragrance free, but the ingredients themselves do emit a mild scent that should dissipate a minute or two after application. Sometimes my skin can tend to be a little sensitive and I didnu2019t have any issues with this. Iu2019m loving the Biossance line so far and will definitely be trying out more of their products in the future."

It wasn't awful but didn't agree with my taste in scents. I did feel that this product performed well on my skin. I usually use the CeraVe Moisturizer which is also a little bit more dense but this one felt more slick and didn't sit on the skin like I feel like the CeraVe one does. All in all, I like this.

I honestly would never buy this cream, not because I did not see a difference, but because of the smell. As soon as I opened up the jar, it smelled like vomit. I put it on my face and it smelled like vomit. I put it in the fridge, hoping that it may change the smell if it was cold, and drumroll please, it still smells like vomit.

Now, Iu2019ve got to say that Iu2019ve never come across a Biossance product I didnu2019t adore before; truly, they usually work very well for me! So, Iu2019m really sorry to say that I had some degree of difficulty even using this product. Outwardly, it looks promising: nice packaging, definitely a u201ccreamy-cream,u201d and itu2019s from Biossance. That alone would likely get me to buy it if I were out at Sephora and in the market for a new cream. But if I did, Iu2019d be disappointed. For me, I couldnu2019t get past the smell. Now, itu2019s advertised as unscented but I got a strong, almost-nostalgic smell of chlorine-mold-mildew-y pool deck at the local Water Park, and I think we all know what the kiddos do in the public pool at their discretion. I donu2019t know if itu2019s the squalane or what, but the smell is so off-putting itu2019s borderline offensive to the olfactory receptors. A hard (yet sorrowful) pass for me; maybe itu2019s a wonder cream and will work for others who can get past the smell.  2 out of 5 stars for being non-comedogenic and vegan.  #complimentary #SpringPicksVoxBox #biossance #texturelove #MoroccanoilBody @Influenster @biossance @mizani @moroccanoil"

It gives my skin enough moisture where my skin feels hydrated, but not overly greasy where it feels like oil is sitting on my skin. It absorbs fairly quickly when you rub into the skin, but does leave a slight film. I think this is great for normal skin. It has a really rich texture almost like a hybrid between a balm and moisturizer. Jars are not my favorite since you have to dip in and sanitary reasons, but I think it is the right component as it might be too thick for a pump. Overall I love this moisturizer, but think if you have dry skin you might not like the satin finish and want a dewier one"

But, after time, it dries down and feels light and leaves your skin soft. You really do need to give this time to work the way it needs to.

I am surprised because it does meet all my skincare needs, natural, fragrance free, chemical free.  This lotion I was hesitant to try as I am with any new skincare product, but let me tell you, WOW! Did not irritate my super sensitive skin! After the first application my skin felt hydrated and plump.  Itu2019s a nice thick texture like the other facial moisturizers is used (dream mask by youth to the people, and honey halo by farmacy) itu2019s great for use at night and during the day! The product is phenomenal, it also layers very well with your other products in your skincare routine! I hate products that pill or become a funky texture when layering- this did not! I love the natural scent it has as well! Scented skincare is so overrated and irritating to my skin.  I have used half the jar now and I am soo happy! The packaging is 1st class as well, the glass jar, the labeling the box it comes it is all top notch. I do wish it came with a spatula for no contamination, but I am using one I already had!"

I donu2019t like scented products anyway, and I use a skinceuticals serum that smells like hot dogs, but I love that one so much/itu2019s so good for my skin that I can look past the smell.

Maybe because prior to using this cream I'm already using a cream with Tocopherol. It's feel of fragrance and essential oils, so it great for sensitive skin.

I checked reviews and saw many complaints about the smellu2014so weird because it didnu2019t smell like anything to me.  Turns out I had COVID.

The scent isnu2019t very good but it is plant derived and clean so I can understand why. I think it has helped my overall texture and fine lines so far and I canu2019t wait to see over even more time.

I am constantly having to either use face wipes or wash my face the second i get home to get makeup off so i dont break out cause if you live in the florida humidity like I do you can just look outside and start to sweat, this has helped alot keeping my skin moisturized and not all rough and dry feeling, only thing I can complain about is the smell which has a very natural smell to it if you know what I mean.

Pros: great ingredients, great packaging, super hydrating  Cons: overpriced, off-putting scent (which does fade after you apply), thick/heavy/greasy  Iu2019ve been a fan of Biossance 100% Squalane since pre-launch (I was a product tester). Iu2019ve been purchasing and using that oil since it was available. I havenu2019t been a fan of their other products, mostly because they contain fragrances or other ingredients which can be very irritating to sensitive skin. I was so happy to see a fragrance free option geared toward dry and sensitive skin.  My first thought when I opened the box was how small the container was for this price-especially since itu2019s a glass container. My next concern was the weird and unpleasant smell of the cream. It smells like an ingredient has gone bad. I did some research to see if this was a common concern and it definitely is. I think clean beauty has gone a bit too far with fear mongering about the dangers of parabens. I encourage you to do your own research. This really smells like the olive oil has gone bad. Shea butter is not the best smelling either but Iu2019ve used lots of fragrance free products and never experienced this type of scent. For a company that started so scientifically and that is priced as is, I expected better.  The texture is heavy and while it did absorb somewhatu2026it left an overly heavy/greasy layer on my skin. It felt really similar to using a product with dimethicone (which it doesnu2019t contain). This is far too heavy for day use in my opinion, especially in the warmer months. I patched tested several times on my arm, leg, and hands before trying this on my face;  the odor and heaviness made me concerned about a reaction. I didnu2019t experience any irritation but I didnu2019t like the feel on my face. I really prefer a cream that fully absorbs. Try a sample first!"

Im using it twice a day (morning and night) and my skin feels so hydrated and glowy. It has also helped with the uneven skin texture and dark spots. This moisturizing cream has a very thick creamy texture but it absorbs quickly on the skin. It doesnu2019t feel oily. It has very mild scent to it, came in a beautiful glass jar. I love using this product, definitely recommend and buying this again"

It is not the most pleasant smell & when you apply it you can smell it on your face for a few seconds. Thank God it goes away because itu2019s not good at all. Hopefully they can figure that out."

The smell was somewhat off-putting, it has the earthy notes of umami, but I was not bothered as it evaporated quickly.

Just going to put down all my feeling on it pointwise. u2728Super interesting ingredients that work hard to make your skin super perfect.  Squalene and Omega, both absolutely plant-based, organic, cruelty free, and works wonders on hydration and moisturizing. u2728 Pretty sure safe for all skin types, but best for normal and dry skin u2728 Best for all ages, especially 25 and up. u2728 Super duper soft and glides literally like homemade butter. It genuinely felt like butter that my mom makes. u2728 Has no particular fragrance, but felt weird in the first sniff( just like homemade butter). But it vanishes in seconds. u2728 Kept me soft, hydrated and moisturized throughout the night and day.  u2728 Doesnu2019t make you feel greasy u2728Perfect base for makeup or no makeup u2728 Worked well with all other products in my 7-step skincare routine. u2728 Absolutely safe for  sensitive skin u2728 A little goes a long way ( pea sized each time) u2728 Pricey, yes, but Absolutely worth it!!!  This definitely made my skin much much softer like babyu2019s skin, glowing from within , smooth, bright and hydrated."

If you have combo to dry skin and especially mature skin, this is an HG. It has beautifully hydrated and plumped my skin for 4 weeks now. I noted reviews about its smell.  I didn't not notice it until I applied the cream without a serum. I use a serum before any moisturizer, but in a hurry recently I just used the Omega without serum.  That is when i noted the smell.  No biggie really, but I can understand the criticism. Apply a serum, any serum, before applying the Omega Repair Creme and it will not smell."

That was during the beginning of winter. - Recently, my skin had been going toward a more dry skin type with the colder weather, and so this cream actually didn't create that oily film!

I saw more fine lines and wrinkles daily. Redness and irritation as well with breakouts worse than my teens. Iu2019m in my 40s for reference. This moisturizer melts into my skin in under a minute.

I was using a different night cream, but I live in a place with constantly changing weather that has wreaked havoc on my skin.   I started peeling and got very dry and extremely itchy. I bought this on the recommendation from an in store employee and it offered immediate relief. Iu2019ve used it for a few days and while a minimal amount of peel is left on my skin, my face feels much more hydrated and quite soft. Yes, there is a little bit of a smell that I really donu2019t like. However, the cream doesnu2019t have much of an odor just sitting in the jar unless you hold it right up to your nose and it goes away within a second or two once itu2019s rubbed in to your skin.   It is ultra rich though, so be prepared when you apply it. For me personally, this is definitely not a cream I would want to apply in the morning under makeup. Itu2019s way too heavy. But as a night time treatment, itu2019s really, really good. A little goes a long way with this one. Take the advice from other reviewers and start with a small amount and add more later. Because I havenu2019t used this for long enough, I donu2019t know what it really will do for fine lines and wrinkles, but the significant boost in hydration is definitely enough to warrant five stars, even with the odd smell."

It appears thick in the jar but once you warm some between  your fingers it glides right onto your skin.

I also love that there is no fragrance in this moisturizer, since fragrance is unnecessary and is often an irritant. Although the smell of this moisturizer is unpleasant (it reminds me of manure or a farm?), the scent is not long-lasting and can be easily overlooked given the effectiveness of the product. I have tried SO many different moisturizers and this is the ONLY one that keeps my skin moisturized without inducing breakouts. It also saved my skin when I accidentally over-exfoliated (e.g., retinol/glycolic acid burns). My only issue with the product is that it can be tricky to apply given its thickness and sometimes the jars are not filled enough. But despite these minor inconveniences, I will continue to buy the product on a regular basis, at least until something better comes along."

It does fade quickly, but it's not the best sensory experience.   I found this cream to be fairly light despite the thick texture, and thought it left a little bit of a filmy residue behind- almost like there was too much glycerine and not enough oil. The old formulation of The Ordinary's Natural Moisturizing Factors+HA left a very similar film.  I thought it was okay- it didn't break me out or cause irritation, it didn't leave my skin greasy or too under-moisturized, but it also didn't make my skin look or feel amazing and smelled like wet socks, and Sephora sells a couple of other moisturizers in the price range that I really enjoy, so this is one I'd definitely pass on."

However, when I finished the jar, I tested the volume capacity of the jar by filling it with 50 mL water. The water came nearly to the brim.  I sent a complaint to Biossance and they brushed me off, saying that sometimes air pockets form and if I tapped the jar gently the product would level out, but because of the volume of the air pocket there was no way the product would have leveled out even to the bottom of the neck, where the thread begins.  This cream is very nice and I have no complaints in that regard, but because the company dismissed my complaint so easily I just won't be buying this again."

Iu2019m highly sensitive to fragrance in products and lingering odors so ai was cautious after reading the reviews but was removed to discover that it works great for me.   PROS:  - thick cream that glides onto skin and absorbs easily - super hydrating and makes my skin look plump and healthy - high-quality glass packaging that can be repurposed  CONS: - packaging. The jar is nice, but I wish this came in a tube or a jar that had a fully open top so itu2019s easier to get out all of the product - for some the smell may be a deal breaker, even if itu2019s brief - no makeup scoop included. For this price the least they could do is include a little plastic scoop to use with the jar.   If youu2019re concerned about the smell, go to a local sephora and open the jar. Try not immediately react, give it a few tries to see if you really dislike it or if itu2019s just unusual. Try it in person for a few days and see if you can live with it as the benefits it provides are just too good to let something small turn you away."

I went back and checked and there is a slight smell, but it's so very light, dissipates almost immediately and it's not a bad smell! Honestly, I've been through a few jars of this by now and never would have even noticed a smell if I hadn't read the reviews here.This is what a lot of fragrance-free beauty products smell like.   But performance-wise....I have very dry, sensitive skin and I really like this cream, especially mixed with or layered with a nice oil (the Biossance Squalane or Rose Vit C oil, or Stratia's Fortify oil or Drunk Elephant's or the Ordinary's marula oils are all great.) Or any nice squalane, marula, maracuja, argan, rosehip or jojoba oil would work, too. Also, just use a tiny bit of the oil if you try this method!  Almost removed one star because occasionally this cream can make my skin sting very slightly for a few seconds. Not sure what's in it that does that. It could be because my skin is just that sensitive, or it might be because it contains a small amount of hyaluronic acid (which sometimes makes my skin sting a bit). Only lasts for a few seconds, and the oils buffer it if you use them. And this cream really does seem to heal and hydrate my dry and sensitive skin. It's a great barrier repair cream if used consistently. I'm not inspired to write many reviews, but this cream inspired me. Highly recommended!"

Not to say that any of the ones I've listed are bad - it's just that this moisturizer works wonders for me! It's definitely a thicker cream but it spreads beautifully and works under sunscreen (though I'm not sure how it would be under makeup). I personally haven't noticed any scent, but I certainly have noticed that my skin isn't dry when I wake up anymore! It is a bit pricy and I'm sure you could find comparable moisturizers at a lower price (like Cerave + squalane), so I'd recommend trying out a sample before going all in. That said, I'll certainly be repurchasing this when I run out!"

I have combo dry sensitive skin and found this cream to be deeply hydrating, soothing, and keeps my skin supple and firm. Ive tried it for AM and PM routine and both results were lovely. To be honest I was quite surprised at how well it worked for my skin.  I did take off one start due to the smell. When you melt it in between you fingers and initially put it on it smells like the jalapeno cheddar chips from old dutch LOL the smell goes away  after ~3 seconds but while you massage it in the smell is definitely that! and then goes away. I just dont breathe for the first few seconds and then im good haha"

Iu2019ve decided to use this on my hands and it has become one of my favorite hand creams! My hands are smooth and soft in the morning after applying at night before bed.

Amazing ingredients no fragrance (I donu2019t get why some are complaining about the smell itu2019s not bad at all, just smells like a normal non scented smell). Fragrance canu2019t irritated your skin over time anyway. It goes on so smooth, it absorbs well and leaves skin glowing without being greasy. Itu2019s hard to find a moisturizing that actually moisturizes your skin and I say this because this product is the only one thatu2019s ever helped within top 2-3 days after using tretinoin and getting flaky skin.

Iu2019ve tried lots of products both in the drug store and high end but this moisturiser is really what does it for me especially because I use potent actives.

Iu2019ve only used this in the winter so far but I think itu2019ll be my all year nightly moisturizer. I was going through an especially hard time with my skin when I started this. I had upped my retinol a bit causing dryness and wearing face masks has been causing extra chin and jaw breakouts. I started using this at night as my last step in my skin care routine and it has totally healed and hydrated my skin after just a few days. My skin feels smoother, more hydrated, plumper and my breakouts are disappearing (not for this but from finding a moisturizer that works with my acne medication). Iu2019m so happy I finally tried this! I noticed the very very faintest smell when first applying but people in the reviews are being extremely DRAMATIC about the scent. Iu2019m really sensitive to scents and this has almost no scent to it. There is the faintest lightest scent that is from the actual active ingredients of the product that are helping your skin. The thing is Biossance didnu2019t add any harsh fragrances or chemicals that are terrible for your skin to try to entice you into trying the product...we should all prefer this to smelling like vanilla while damaging our skin. Thank you Biossance for always using safe, effective, cruelty free and sustainable ingredients only!"

Iu2019ve had literally no irritation at all despite having dry, acne prone and sometimes sensitive skin. I have seen wonderful results with steady use over the past 6 weeks with twice daily use. My skin feels and stays more hydrated throughout the day which is a huge game changer for anyone going through harsh and dry winters. Although this doesnu2019t have an advertised u201cplumpingu201d affect, I am still noticing overall more plump skin, and it may be that it is just hydrating me SO effectively.

If you need a scent, just layer their vitamin C and rose oil right overtop of it, they combine quite nicely and make my skin so so soft because they also both have squalene. I just HAD to write a good review because itu2019s ludicrous that the overall rating has been dragged down over a smell..... this is a moisturizer not a perfume!"

I'm still looking for a vegan and CF replacement for my CeraVe, and this was one of the products on my list to try, but I decided against it due to the price tag. So when Sephora offered it as a redeemable, I was pretty excited to try it! Unfortunately, I'm not impressed. I have a bunch of skin issues that impair barrier function and a fragrance allergy, so the smell is a non-issue for me. The ingredients are nice, but the product itself wasn't all that moisturizing - certainly not better than my $14 drugstore moisturizer. I also found it super greasy, probably because of squalane being the second ingredient, and even after several hours, it had not soaked into my skin. I ended up wiping it off because I couldn't stand it anymore. I have normal-dry skin, so if it's too greasy for dry skin then I'm not sure who it's for. My skin conditions are under control thanks to my current routine, so maybe it's nicer for repair instead of as a maintenance product but it just didn't do it for me. Three stars feels generous, honestly, but the ingredients are good, it's vegan and CF, and the packaging is gorgeous so it gets points for those. It's just not a great formula and it's incredibly overpriced for what it is, there are nicer moisturizers that cost significantly less per oz. If your skin can't get enough oils, you might like it better but I still think you could get the same effect and save money with a different product."

This is just what un-scented cosmetics smell like - the ingredients that are in them, without being masked by horrible perfumes.   Definitely recommend, even if I do find the price a little high."

This cream doesn't feel as thick/balmy as the Creme Ancienne, which I would apply at night and still feel on my skin in the morning. I do think the Creme Ancienne was more hydrating, but this one is hydrating enough for cold/dry winters. It sinks into the skin quickly and I don't feel like I have anything on my face. Unlike Creme Ancienne, I can use it day and night. Love it!"

Actually, the smell is almost comforting knowing that I'm putting ingredients on my skin that had/bring life and that it isn't perfumed and drying!"

I mean, everything from CeraVe to Drunk Elephant. However, this moisturizer does not. It definitely gives my skin extra moisture when it needs it most and does not burn. Impressive. (3)  I didn't notice any smell whatsoever. I noticed some reviewers saying it smelled really bad - I think they should return their product bc it likely has spoiled somehow. I don't think my product has any particular scent to it. (4) It does take some time to sink in. (Tho admittedly I put on A LOT of the cream - you could always use less). You may like this - it gives your face a glow. If not, then you can use it as a nighttime moisturizer. Personally, I don't have any issues applying it before I apply my makeup in the morning. (5) The ingredient list is so amazing. I can actually recognize most of the ingredients. This cream contains lots of quality ingredients for your skin.  BOTTOM-LINE - Deep moisturizer for ultra-dry or sensitive skin. Quality ingredients. No discernible smell."

The moment I opened the box, the smell of the cream hit me like a ton of bricks. I thought it was something else from outside since my washroom window was open but I smeared a pea amount on my chin and almost threw up. The smell also lingers all day so I found it so hard to concentrate. Having to wear a mask all day long with the smell of this cream stuck in there is terrible. I'd definitely go in-store and try a small dab of a sample of the back of your hand before commiting. I bought it online and sadly had to return it because I can't bear the smell.

Lately Iu2019ve been really wanting to try their other skin care products & bought the limited edition sampler box ... my goodness, fell madly in love with the squalane omega repair cream! completely exceeded my expectations! Itu2019s like putting face butter on my face, so smooth, glides on so easily & absorbs fast & perfectly... & leaves the skin instantly hydrated & looking healthier & with that subtle u2018plumpedu2019 effect, it just feels like u just fed the skin all the nutrients it needed! I personally love it! I think itu2019s powerful enough u can use it once a day, thatu2019s all I need for my skin. I would say use the gel for when your skin doesnu2019t need extra hydration and use the cream for when itu2019s extra dry it needs a little boost or overnight... love this product, high-quality & effective. No break outs yet either, was worried about that b/c leaves moist dewey effect on skin & just feels like so much hydration. The other one Iu2019ve tried so far that I loved too is the eye cream, Iu2019ll do a separate review but that one is definitely super hydrating to the eye area too. Thank u Biossance! Ps. u2018The smellu2019 of the cream does not bother me at all, itu2019s neutral & barely anything at all in my opinion. I appreciate that about Biossance too, it is mostly odorless without those added strong artificial scents Iu2019ve had w/ other brands. The cream is subtle effective & pleasant to me, 5 stars:)"

I got the mini/sample version as my sephora birthday gift last year and use it as a night cream and firstly, with this stuff a little bit goes a loooooong way. In the approximate year I have had it, I've only just recently ran out, and the sampler is only 5ml. I have oily/combo skin, with very prominent acne scarring/dark spots from hormonal acne I got after high school (I am twenty-three.) so as you can imagine I've tried alot of different products/methods. I started layering this on top of a rosehip oil before I go to bed and it really has helped me skin immensely, just by preventing new breakouts and really helping my mosture barrier. My skins feels cleaner, smoother, my skin tone looks more even, and less dull. It is a thicker cream so if you lean oily you're not gonna have a good time using this in your morning routine, but putting this on as your last step before you go to sleep you're going to wake up feeling so plump, hydrated, and bouncy. The ONLY complaints I have are the smell at first is a little funky. It doesn't linger for long at all and it's not overpowering but at first I was concerned it went bad, until I found out that's just the smell. Secondly, the price definitely makes me cringe, but maybe that's just me. I WILL be purchasing the full size, but you better believe I'm not gonna tell people I dropped 60 dollars for it."

I've seen others comment that after a while it starts to smell. I have found this too. It wasn't enough to notice, but when I opened a new bottle I noticed that it smelled much nicer than my old one. I think it is because as time passes, dipping your fingers into the bottle deposits bacteria and those accumulate in the product. I solved this by tranfering the cream into a pump bottle that I bought of amazon (kind of looks like the drunk elephant protini bottle). It's kind of a hassle, but the product is so good I don't mind. I hope they switch to more hygenic packaging in the future!"

I have combination skin that easily becomes greasy, and I have never had a problem using this product. I wouldnu2019t go wild and slather it on thick in the summer time if youu2019re like me and have combination skin, but a nice thin layer of it works perfectly for me.   Iu2019m very confused by the reviews commenting on the smell. It definitely doesnu2019t have a fake, sweet parfume smell, but it also doesnu2019t have a u201csouru201d odor. I find it to have a pretty plain scent, similar to other unscented products. But, everyoneu2019s scent is different, so itu2019s possible it comes off more earthy to others.    The price point is high, but the quality and clean ingredients justify it for me. This is the first Biossance product I have used, and Iu2019m really looking forward to purchasing others. Their new mask is in my Top 3 on my skincare wishlist right now (and itu2019s a longgg one)."

After I use it, I notice that my skin looks and sometimes feels renewed (refreshed is impossible, without a latte macchiato in hand). It's almost as like you wore highlighter to bed and it didn't come off on the pillow, your skin looks dewy and feels hydrated after a hard night sleep.  First, all you'll need is 1-2 dime size dollops of the product, warmed up in your hands, and it smoothly glides across and nourishes every part of your face and neck. Using too much, it'll start to feel heavy.  Understandably, for some individuals this product will be too rich for their skin, this product is made for those with naturally dehydrated skin (like mine). It doesn't always matter how much or how often you stay hydrated, sometimes your skin needs a little boost from your skincare routine. The omega fatty acids and hyaluronic acids in this product will do the exactly that, give your skin the boost it desperately needs.   I cannot complain when I have an eczema flare-up either, it doesn't irritate the outbreak spots at all. Seriously, my desert-skinned sisters, try it.   Listen to your skin, be kind to your skin, love your skin."

I have skin sensitivity issues so I have to change it up and I have to mess around with it just like a cook would in the kitchen for a recipe and I've used eye creams around my mouth to help with lines and I'm going to try this on under my eyes now because it is EXTREMELY rick and does REALLY well with my skin in conjunction with the other product lines I've mentioned above.  I'm 47 and I've done some cigarette smoking and I'm trying to stop and if I had not taken care of my skin so much over the years I would look really bad right now but these products ARE helping me improve my skin while I taper off smoking/quit.  Read some articles about aging/smoking/turning 50+ and what happens and that will definitely help one quit smoking HOWEVER...my skin looks amazing because of these products.  It's definitely taken a hit due to medical/personal issues but these products have been EXTREMELY IMPACTING on recovering my skin, again, I just turned 47.  Biossance + Dr. Dennis Gross + Ole Henrickson = TOP FAVS + well priced especially considering the return of these products.  Investing in a bit at a time helps as well as using enough/not to much and ensuring you fully use all of the product.  I've cut tubes open to get the rest of the product out.  I do NOT waste my skincare products and I ensure that I use ALL of it."

It's a pro and con. Pro because it's clearly formulated with added scents, but I wish they would somehow neutralize the smell. It smells like a cross between melted plastic and feet that is really hard to get past. However, it disappears shortly after application when it gets absorbed and not strong enough for others to notice on you. If you are someone who have dry skin and sensitive to a variety of perfumes and essential oils, I would recommend this.

During this time I ran out of my previous skincare regimen (which honestly, wasn't helping much with the dry skin anyway. My skin just drank it up, and after 5 mins it felt like I had never used anything at all.) I needed a new moisturizer until the one I ordered (from a DIFFERENT well known line) came.  I'm sure I damaged my skin horribly by using this drugstore moisturizer somehow... my face WAS ANGRY.  I was hoping it was just resurfacing from my resurfacing cleanser. But it continues FOR WEEKS, and  I have been using that, every other day, for a year and a half with no issues. When the new moisturizer came, IT GOT WORSE. My face would burn HORRIBLY, and it seemed like my face didnt even want to absorb it... I ended up up with red, dry/flaky patches on my neck, and under my eyes were peeling and so sore.  Enter in Biossance. I bought the ENTIRE  anti-aging line and my face loved it immediately  After using this moisturizer, my face is finally so soft and not peeling/burning anymore... Love it!"

First of all it gave me breakouts over my chin and my jaw. I didnu2019t want to think it was this so I tried to use it again after my break out went away. Nope, my face broke out again!!!!!!!! I donu2019t know too much about ingredients but I bought this because I saw all kinds of skincare channels raving about the ingredients in this.  In addition, I feel like the texture is really weird, it is almost waxy and it does want to blend out on my skin evenly or skin in. It leaves a film on my skin with a white cast, not that I mind the white cast b/c I use this product at night, but I mean I have dryer skin and I live in upstate NY(winter here is terrible)so I like heavy things. This thing is heavy but it is floating on the top of the skin, not really moisturizing. Plus it smells like straight plastic.  Anyways, PLEASE DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY on this product, it is stupidly expensive. Go get something else like the Curel cream or the belief moisturizing cream (not the gel version) or anything else. Please guys, I think even cetaphile at the drugstore works better."

I am 59 years old, and the last year or so my cheeks have been getting very dry, and nothing I tried really seemed to help.  Even with moisturizer and a hydrating foundation, my skin still looked dry and lackluster.  I have to be careful what I use on my skin because it is very prone to clogging and whiteheads, so I had started layering several lighter weight products to try to moisturize my skin,  This cream is like a miracle.  First of all, there is no detectable fragrance which I love!  It hydrates my skin beautifully, yet does not cause my pores to clog or cause breakouts.  Wears beautifully under makeup.  I have been using it morning and night since I tried it, and I am going to Sephora today to buy the full size jar.  I would give this cream 100 stars if I could, it is that wonderful.  I want to say thank you Biossance for making this fabulous cream.  I am so happy that I found it."

Absolute miracle in a jar, leaves my combo skin smooth and glowing and DOES NOT clog pores or cause acne, it actually helped me with my overall texture and got rid of tiny bumps I had on my cheeks. My sister with dry skin loves it too, works great for her as well. I recommended it to all my friends and they fell in love with it, one friend told me that it saved her skin when she went to Norway and it was freezing cold. She had cracks from the cold and after applying this cream, they went away in a few days! This is definitely a night cream because it is a bit heavy and leaves a slight shine but it quickly goes away and I can feel my skin hydrated and nourished throughout the night.  I recommend it to everyone but especially to people with oily, sensitive and acne prone skin. It will do wonders! The smell is not the best not gonna lie but at least they donu2019t put any fragrance in it so you know itu2019s all natural. Biossance products are absolutely amazing and I swear by this brand, very gentle but extremely effective!"

After trying a few things, I found Biossance about 2-3 months ago and Iu2019ve fallen in love. The brand has many of the same beliefs Aveda has and packaging is even kind of similar. The similarities end there. The product actually does what it claims. My skin looks awesome and fine lines and wrinkles Iu2019d been worrying about are slowly diminishing. I love that this product is very rich and thick without being heavy or greasy. It completely settles into my skin after about 30 minutes. When I wake up in the morning, my skin still feels hydrated and looks dewy. My complexion and uneven skin tone has evened out and I havenu2019t had any issues with breakouts on my extremely sensitive skin. Iu2019m really impressed and I will be with this skincare line for a while. Iu2019m using other products in the line as well and Iu2019ve been equally happy with those. The downfalls are price, but you do get a reasonable amount of product and it lasts, and the smell. I feel like it smells somewhere between homemade bread and a brewery. Very yeasty, earthy smell. I donu2019t hate the smell, I donu2019t love it. For what the product does I can definitely look past it and Iu2019d rather the smell than some nasty chemical fragrance covering it up. I can see it being an issue for some, however. Regardless, I highly recommend!"

Even though it claims to be good for all skin types I think this product is definitely better suited for dry skin types because the product sat on top of my skin for far too long after massaging it into my face for quite a bit of time.

I use this during the night under their tea tree oil and instead of making me a grease-ball or exacerbating breakouts, my skin feels more balanced and whenever I get pimples during that time of the month, they are SUPER tiny! Would really recommend this product!"

I am out of my Normal cream right now and I am cringing when I go to apply this one for the meantime until I can go get more of my go-to. I only gave two stars because I havenu2019t felt the need to reapply cream which is usually the case having very dry skin, as well since it is not greasy. Iu2019m not sure if I can really say itu2019s because of this product though since I am using hyaluronic acid and burdock oil from The Ordinary and have already noticed an insane difference in hydration from that the past two weeks."

Best of all, my skin is soft and moisturized! Will it work in the summer? I don't know but im willing to try it out considering how quickly this delivered results. I knocked off a star for price point. Seems steep for under 2 oz., but take into consideration i compared this against La Mer and i think this worked WAY better.

My face feels sooo good in the morning! This destroyed any dryness I had on my nose (from blowing it constantly in colder weather), which none of my arsenal of other moisturizers have been able to do. I havenu2019t had any breakouts because of this moisturizer and I think itu2019s really is u201crepairingu201d my skin because a lot of my PIH from acne is fading more quickly without any additional changes to my skin care routine. Also this is silicone free, which I love. Yeah, the jar aspect of it isnu2019t so great but just get a little spoon or spatula and get the smallest amount out so your fingers donu2019t have to go into the jar.

The smell does eventually go away once you work it in and it's been on for a while but it is absolutely horrendous. I'm not a fan of synthetic fragrances in beauty products but this is one of the worst smelling products I've ever encountered and could do with at least a natural fragrance if there's one that non-irritating. I'm going to try and finish it up (because I obviously paid for it) but would not repurchase or recommend. If it had no smell I'd say it's a pretty good moisturizer for dry to very dry skin but the smell completely ruins it for me.

I feel that I have gained sensitivity to fragrance in skincare/makeup products over the years. Now, it just irritates my skin so I am trying to shift away from those types of products. This product is also vegan and has a bunch of fatty acids that is just so good for your face especially for acne-prone skin. It creates a barrier on your skin to prevent transepidermal water loss - and that is awesome for my dehydrated skin - thanks to the squalane. It does take a bit of time to massage to your face especially if you put too much. Feels like rubbing a sunscreen but it doesn't bother me since I love it so much. I use it day and night.

Just moderate the amount you use to your needs. But it also absorbs well and keep the skin dewy.   One day I woke up with ugly small bumpy looking pimples that I have never had in my life, so I ran to the dermatologist. He said perioral dermitis is hard to cure and I need to take antibiotics, but caution because you may have vomiting, diarrhea....all the fun stuff.   I walked in to Sephora a mess and honestly was shopping as therapy to some guy telling me my face was randomly and likely permanently a mess. This lovely lady at Sephora helps me out. I buy this product and in a week it was pretty much gone!! Seriously I have made ALL my besties buy this. Not even joking."

Once I was a few months from hitting 25 and started noticing my face change I realized I needed to start taking care of my skin. I've found a good skincare regimen with a combination of The Ordinary and Herbivore products. However, the NYC winter air has been a little too much for my dry skin and I needed a more substantial moisturizer from a cream. I've tried a few samples from other cruelty-free brands at Sephora and none had really wowed me yet, but this did. I noticed pretty immediate help for the dryer spots of my face and moisture lasts all day without feeling greasy. It may be too much moisture for someone with Oily skin. It's unscented so it has a slight fatty smell but it goes away almost immediately and I don't really notice it. The smell is similar to Drunk Elephant's La La cream but much less intense. You also don't have to use a lot as it spreads really well and I appreciate that it will last longer than other brands with 50ML of product that are more expensive. Biossance is also an environmentally responsible company using renewable sugarcane for the squalene on top of being a cruelty-free company using good ingredients so it's a win for me."

BUT, since Iu2019d never tried a Biossance product that clogged my pores or broke me out, I decided to get a sample anyways and give it a go.  WOW is this product an exception to that!! When you first feel this cream, it will seem thick, but when you smooth it onto your skin, (little goes a long way) it absorbs so quickly and doesnu2019t feel like you have this layer on your skin. Itu2019s also calming and makes my skin instantly feel comfortable (even when itu2019s angry at me). NEVER broke me out or clogged pores and had no problems using it over existing blemishes (which is rare).   When you wake up and look in the mirror, itu2019s almost shocking how much this evens skin tone, almost completely takes away any redness (coming from someone with Rosacea nonetheless!), and even somehow takes away any bumpy texture or inflammation I had (which I NEVER thought a cream could do)!  Seriously, if you have combo, dry, or oily yet dehydrated skin (ESPECIALLY if your natural moisture barrier has been damaged from winter or too much cleansing/exfoliation), this is a MUST try!!!   It balances out my oily and dry areas and repairs my moisture barrier faster than any of the dozens of products Iu2019ve tried (from cheap to very expensive)."

Itu2019s lightweight yet creamy, absorbs quickly and doesnu2019t leave my face greasy. I have a dry skin and this winter has certainly not been kind (polar vortex anyone?) I was using DE cream for several months but as the air got drier, so as my face and DE cream was no longer able to keep my skin moisturized. After my own intense research of u201ccleanu201d products I decided to give this one a shot. I know the price will make you cringe and cry for a week, but honestly itu2019s worth every penny. My boyfriend always comments on how soft my face is, and this is the only thing that I changed in my daily facial routine. I saw some reviewers mentioning of bad scent. I really donu2019t know what theyu2019re talking about because this product virtually has no scent. It has a very light u201cnaturalu201d odor which one can expect in every product that is fragrance-free, but I only smell it when I actually stick my nose in the jar. Iu2019m picky with scents and since I have a sensitive skin Iu2019m always in search of unscented products. This product doesnu2019t bother me at all (unlike unrefined shea butter whose earthy scent hits you the moment you pop off the lid). Already purchased a second jar. Highly recommend!"

I have sensitive skin that can be up and down in terms of how dry or oily it is, and the Squalane   Omega Repair Cream works perfectly no matter what state my skin is in without causing any irritation! The cream is super hydrating, yet I don't hesitate to apply it even when I'm experiencing blemishes, because the cream is totally non-comedogenic. On top of all of these skin benefits, I love what the Biossance brand stands for, with its clean and healthy ingredients, its eco-friendly packaging, and its transparency! I would note that this may not be ideal for use during the day, especially in the summer or if you tend toward oily skin, simply because it does not totally soak in. However, it is perfect for nightly use on all skin types and for daytime use on drier skin or during drier months."

I'm now in my fourth month of daily use and can honestly say this has become my holy grail lightweight moisturizer.  I would rate this 4.5 stars if I could.  The only reason for the 4.5 star rating is because when the weather is dry and cold, I don't feel it is as moisturizing as say Lala-Retro.  For a spring-fall cream, I think it is great for both morning and evening use.  In the winter I personally like to use it at night and the Lala during the day.  However, keep in mind I have senstive skin and due to chronic hives I need a bit extra moisture than most.  I highly recommend the Squalane and Omega cream for anyone who is looking for a nice, light, and soft cream for daytime or night time use."

I did take one star off because I love everything about this product, the packaging (beautiful!) quality of ingredients, outstanding and of course great results. But i will a say I am not crazy about the scent. It isnu2019t pleasant in my opinion.  I also have to be careful not to use too much of this moisturizer or my skin looks oily and greasy and feels like i have some thick layer of cream on my face.  I received this product complimentary for sampling purposes but all opinions are my own."

I did not want to write a review at the beginning of my journey, so I waited and it's been close to a month. I have used this moisturizer after washing my face with a age renewal cream cleanser, toning, and applying a serum not products of biossance. I have had very dry skin with some adult acne on my cheeks occasionally. I have to say the cream moisturizer feels really good on application, it does not have a strong scent, and it seeps in pretty deep into the top layers of my skin. I would occasionally reapply overnight as my skin would get a little dry. I live in a desert and southern California and it's very cold and dry this time of year. I did not see a great change in fine lines, but the dryness was definitely better as a result. I am going to be 40 and I'm definitely having some hormonal changes that has been affecting my skin, so I will continue to use to see what results I have."

The formula has a nice, smooth consistency and leaves my skin feeling refreshed and soft. Iu2019m not a huge fan of the smell, itu2019s not bad, but also not good. I would say itu2019s a medicated lotion smell, itu2019s a little off putting but itu2019s not a deal breaker.   A little bit of this goes a long way.

Well, I've been lucky to receive the Biossance complimentary voxbox through @influenster to test and review the Squalane + Omega Repair Cream. After 3 weeks of using it regularly, here are my thoughts: . Before receiving this cream, I was breaking out like crazy and didn't really know what was causing it. I decided to stop everything I was using and simplified my skincare. I was apprehensive to try the cream at first,  but I'm glad I did because I'm in love with this cream. It's unscented, absorbs quickly, and makes your skin feel smooth and healthy. It didn't break me out and I helped calm my skin. So happy with this cream and excited to try other products from Biossanceu2764 . Quick Info: This cream has squalane, omega fatty acids, ceramides, and plant sterols. It is non-toxic, paraben free, phthalate free, mineral oil free, and fragrance free. . #biossancexinfluenster #biossance #contest #complimentary"

IT IS A CLEAN SKINCARE PEOPLE, it is not suppose to have any scent (if it does, it will smell natural like this one) or heavily scent at all. If your moisturizer has a heavy scent it is a no no. Really bad for your face. I don't think i'm going back to any other moisturizer. This is the best, not even Lamer overly perfumed moisturizers have the same benefits and luxury feeling to this."

I have sensitive skin, usually combination, but this winter California weather has made it more dry and flaky. I'm 32, wanting something to revitalize my face and prevent any aging.  Initially the packaging is so luxurious. Honestly its not something that I would think to purchase for myself. The container feels heavy and it felt expensive, - coming from someone who usually purchases drug store brands. I decided to test out the cream on the base of my neck to test out the product with my skin,  it was so soft! The next day, knowing that I didn't get a reaction, I put it on my face. It felt very nice, not greasy, I used it in the evening because its fairly thick. I plan to try it under makeup one day, but have not yet. It does have a slight scent, but I stopped noticing it after a few minutes. So far so great, I hope I continue to see a difference."

Itu2019s thick (so a little goes a long way), but just sinks riiiight into your skin.   Iu2019ve used plenty of heavy moisturizers that just sit right on top of your skin, without ever really absorbing.  Not this one!! My skin literally drank it in, and looks so smooth and dewy. And - bonus for anyone with adult-acne-prone skin (like me!) - it wonu2019t break you out! I was so relieved and pleasant surprised, since many heavier creams do make me break out.  Pro tip: put it on right before bed and go to sleep. The next day, donu2019t wash it off! Either leave it be, or spritz a very light mist of water on top and gently pat it in. Then apply foundation/concealer right on top; the moisturizer acts very much like a primer, saving you a step and giving you glowy skin.  Full disclosure: I received this product for free for sampling purposes, but the opinions expressed are my own! :-)"

My to go is either Cetaphil or CeraVe and I lather this all over my face.  With that said, this moisturizer is pretty thick. I usually go to sleep feeling super moisturized. However, I noticed that I wake up in the morning with my face feeling tight and dry. Iu2019m not sure why. I am applying a good amount to my face. However, when I apply this moisturizer in the day time, itu2019s the perfect amount of moisture. Iu2019m going to keep trying it out to see if my face adapts to it at night. Also, another con is the smell. Iu2019m not sure why the product smells the way it does. Itu2019s not a very pleasant smell. However, i would rather take this smell over products that smell too good. I think thatu2019s a sign that chemicals have been used.  All in all, I would say I like this moisturizer so far. Aside from my face feeling tight in the morning, my complexion looks bright and glowing. It really soaks into my skin. I love how incredibly safe their products are for the environment and our skin. I mean their squalane is 100% plant based!"

So last night I went and purchased the full size and I just canu2019t clap loud enough, Iu2019m so excited to see what this moisturizer does to my skin a month from now...I donu2019t think Iu2019ll even need to wear foundation ever again."

I have extremely dry skin and found most creams to just sit on top of my skin without really doing much. Love that this glides on and feels like it's nourishing from within.  Also wears really well under makeup.  Highly recommend!"
