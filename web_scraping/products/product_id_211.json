	"about": "Fragrance Family:Florals.Scent Type:Warm Florals.Key Notes:Mandarin, Ylang-Ylang, Vanilla.Fragrance Description:A fresh, floral explosion of femininity, this radiant reinvention of the iconic Good Girl scent reveals the multifaceted nature of modern womanhood with a double dose of sensual vanilla and exotic ylang-ylang..About the Bottle:This fragrance is housed in a delicate pastel-pink stiletto..About the Fragrance:Inspired by powdery blush, this 100 percent vegan perfume contrasts the sensuality of two different vanilla extracts with the romanticism of a peony heart note. The vanilla and ylang-ylang it contains are each sustainably sourced.",
	"ingredients": "Alcohol Denat., Parfum (Fragrance), Aqua (Water), Hydroxycitronellal, Limonene, Benzyl Salicylate, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Linalool, Hexyl Cinnamal, Citral, Alcohol, Tris(Tetramethylhydroxypiperidinol) Citrate, Coumarin, Benzyl Benzoate, Benzyl Alcohol, Ci 14700 (Red 4), Ci 60730 (Ext. Violet 2).",
	"how_to_use": "Suggested Usage:.-Fragrance is intensified by the warmth of your own body. Apply in the creases of your knees and elbows for a longer-lasting, stronger scent.&nbsp;.-After applying, avoid rubbing or dabbing skin. This breaks down the fragrance, causing it to wear off more quickly.&nbsp;.-If you prefer placing fragrance on your wrists, be sure to reapply after frequent handwashing, as this tends to rinse off the scent.&nbsp;.-Replace fragrance after 12 months. Expired perfumes more than a year old lose the integrity of the original scent...Eau de Toilette or Eau de Parfum?: .The difference lies in the volume of perfume oil. While EDT contains five to nine percent, EDP contains more, usually eight to 14 percent. EDPs, therefore, last longer and smell more intense.",

			"review_text": "I am so picky about perfumes and I can not stand most of them. I have been on the lookout for my signature scent forever, and I found it in this. This is the first time I bought the full size of any perfume because even the ones I can tolerate I don't like enough to really commit to. Every time I have shared this with a friend they love it and go buy it for themselves immediately. To me, it smells like a bubble bath at the beginning. Specifically like the strawberry bubble bath for kids that came by the gallons we all used but way more subtle and less artificial. When it dries down, it smells a little more gourmand and vanilla. One thing I don't like about a lot of the most famous perfumes is how sharp and overpowering they are. This is soft, feminine, and powdery and the floral is very subtle and bright, not at all grandma-like. Personally, I didn't think it lasted very long as I couldn't smell it after about an hour or two, and this was my only disappointment with the product. However, people always tell me I smell good and ask what I am wearing long after I think the scent has worn off so perhaps you just become nose blind to it. Lastly, this packaging is the cutest I have seen and I love the color. I think it's so fitting that the one perfume I like looks like this!"

Because of where the spray nozzle/button is, when you‚Äôre spraying you‚Äôre applying pressure to the heel so I feel like one day it‚Äôll just snap off.

This reinterpretation is definitely more sensual than her most popular Good Girl scent. The top notes of Bergamot and Bitter Almond really shine through when you first spray it. As it develops it starts to reveal a bit of Peony and Ylang-Ylang, and when it settles you can smell the base notes of Vanilla, but not in a sweet way. To me, it definitely gives more of a mature, warm, floral scent. It‚Äôs a very wearable perfume for any age group. My daughter who is in her 20‚Äôs has been stealing it, and my mother who is in her 60‚Äôs also quite enjoys it! I‚Äôve been wearing it to work most days, and while the scent does fade a bit throughout the day I can definitely still smell it at the end of my work day. You can expect it to last at least 7 hours. The iconic Caroline Herrera perfume bottles are gorgeous! The packaging definitely accentuates the luxurious aspect of this perfume experience. The high heel stiletto bottle fades into a light, soft pink color that fits with the name of this perfume perfectly. It is a bit on the pricier side coming in at 175$ Canadian for a 50ml bottle, but it is so worth it! Highly recommend!"

You could even use it as a phone test just for fun.    The fragrance itself is a romantic take on the original Good Girl scent. It's got a fresh, floral, peony-vanilla combo. The peony is quite clearly the star although the other notes help to elevate everything including a double dose of vanilla, two forms of ylang-ylang and upcycled rosewater. It's delicate and feminine. Plus I find even with the smallest spray that the fragrance lasts hours and isn't overpowering. I absolutely loved it and the amount of compliments I receive while wearing this perfume is unprecedented.   Thanks Influenster for sending me this little gem.

I find it lasts on the skin until the end of the day but it wears off to a vanilla like note by the end of the day, no longer floral like as when first applied. It's a scent I can wear everyday as a fresh girly flowery scent. I would not use this as a night scent for myself but as a day only scent. I would not buy this again but I do enjoy it!! I like flowery scents but this was almost a tad too much floral, but it was still nice."

First off, the packaging is very feminine and attractive, which would probably help make this a lovely gift. As for the scent itself, unfortunately, it is just too powdery for my liking. Also, the top note of almond oil really is not something I appreciate. The flowery aspect of the perfume is not so bad, however, it certainly is more of a peony scent (not my favourite when it comes to a perfume). I found the perfume to be medium lasting, and I did not feel anything special while wearing it. There are better options out there."

It smells crisp and expensive to me also while smelling familiar. feminine without being juvenile. I recommend to try in store or bring home a sample, if purchasing online I think it is enjoyable enough to buy and return if it doesn‚Äôt suit you.

The iconic stiletto bottle is feminine and playful. I have to admit I did not love the fact that ( on the 30 ml sized bottle at least)  the entire stiletto heel must be removed to spray the perfume. The bottle cannot stand without the heel, and I found the heel portion difficult to remove. Not a big deal, just awkward. Perfume smells different on everyone, so I always test it on my skin, AND my clothes. I actually preferred this scent on my skin, over my clothes. This scent, to me, had a very citrusy, almost bitter opening note, then I got strong floral, then finally a sweet powdery drydown with a hint of vanilla.  I love the final scent. I did notice that it does not last long on my skin. Though this will not be the scent I reach for over and over, it is very pretty and I really enjoyed wearing this fragrance.

I love the pink/black/gold colour combo and the high heeled shoe for a bottle is just genius. It's nice to have something fun and different on the shelf instead of just a regular bottle. It was a little tough at first to get the lid off, I was afraid that I might snap the heel but once I got it off it was smooth sailing the next few times.  I do not have a nose like my husband who can pick out every note in a fragrance. I found the flower scent to be overpowering for my taste and wish that it had been a little softer. I find when you first apply it is too much but after about 45 minutes its a more bearable scent. I had hoped for something a little more unique with all the scents in it but find it very generic smelling and not something that stands out for me. If you like flowery, strong and fairly long lasting this one is for you.  I see myself wearing it more in the warmer months of the year and will use over time but not something that I would rush out and buy again when it is gone."

The Camille blended beautifully with the floral creating an amazing more heady scent that‚Äôs perfect going into fall/winter. The warmth of the vanilla really makes this a great cozy scent for the colder months. This perfume has nailed making floral fit in a warm cozy way. It lasts ages once applied and is not overpowering nor is it to light. A perfect scent. I will definitely repurchase."

The perfume dries down into a lovely powdery scent of peony, roses and ylang ylang. I can smell some bitter almond and bergamot as well which are the top notes of this perfume. The perfume sprays on strong, but the scent becomes very subtle within 2-3 hours. I think that it makes a great perfume for springtime.

I can put it on in the morning and in the evening you can still smell it. I've gotten many compliments from people on this perfume. My husband who has an allergy and a sensitivity to many perfumes is okay with this one. I always give him the bottle to smell before I even put a perfume on. And this one doesn't bother him at all. He actually quite enjoys the fragrance. I will definitely be looking at purchasing more once the sample I received is empty."

If you are looking for a feminine fragrance that you can wear year-round for work, date nights, or running errands, this is it! In terms of lasting power, on me it lasted all day and I could smell it on my sweatshirt the next day. I also can‚Äôt write a review without mentioning the bottle because it‚Äôs stunning! This fragrance would be a great gift idea if you are unsure of what to get."

Good Girl Blush is a powerful and feminine sweet fragrance. One spray is all it takes for your senses to be immersed in the floral aroma, and one look at the exquisite high heeled bottle will give your confidence and femininity an immediate boost.  The scent is long lasting and can be overwhelming if overdone. Personally I see it more fit for an evening out or special occasion, as opposed to everyday use, as it is quite powerful.  CH Good Girl Blush is definitely a signature scent that leaves a sultry aromatic trail of beauty, elegance and confidence."

Even when I'm done, I plan to keep the bottle for decoration. Just too beautiful to throw out. Like far away and you can recognize it by its distinct packaging. My only fear was knocking it over and breaking the bottle.  My fav scent is anything floral. So was very happy to receive this. It's labelled as a floral scent that is a mix of vanilla, mandarin, and ylang-ylang. Found it to be a captivating nice sweet powdery floral & vanilla scent. It lasted the whole day. By the day of a long day, some of it wore off but was able to still detect a faint scent lingering.  Looking forward to trying the other perfumes offered by this brand as I plan to have a shelf of the this whole beautiful stiletto collection.  @Influenster @carolinaherrera"

Good Girl Blush is a beautiful, soft fresh floral scent that embodies femininity, elegance and effortless glamour.  Upon first spritz, the opening is very bright and uplifting. I immediately get hit with a burst of delicious mouthwatering fruity citrus which are the notable notes of Bergamot and Mandarin Oranges.  After about 15 minutes in, it dries down into this lovely powdery bouquet of flowers:   Peony, Exotic Ylang-Ylang and Rose water with a yummy creamy background of Vanilla throughout.  The perfume is housed in an exquisite Pastel-Pink Stiletto Heel symbolizing female empowerment. The bottle is quite striking and eye-catching making it a memorable gift for that beauty lover in your life who loves luxury fragrances. Overall, I truly enjoyed this perfume! It made me feel beautiful and well put together.  The projection was great and I got a solid 6 hours of wear time before having to reapply.  If you are into soft sophisticated floral scents, I would recommend you trying this one out!"

A little goes a long way with this one and it lasts ALL DAY.   I feel like this would be a perfect night out fragrance. It's sexy without being overly floral and it's not fruity.

First impressions, the bottle is probably one of the coolest looking bottles I've ever seen. The gold stiletto, pastel pink sole, is not only sexy, but it is sophisticated sitting on my dresser. The mixed notes of mandarin, ylang ylang and vanilla bring such warmth reminding me of candy and flowers.If you spray too much, it is quite strong, however once it settles its quite beautiful. I did notice however that the smell on my skin didn't last the entire day, it did last longer on my clothes, but that was ok as many places these days try to remain scent free. Normally I don't gravitate to vanilla and prefer only floral scents, however this is perfect for a transitional period from summer to winter."

If it were a colour, the pink of the bottle is a perfect depiction. It's hard for me to think back this far but it almost reminds me of a sophisticated exclamation! for those of you in my age group!  It is a nice perfume with a lasting scent. If you like Candy by Prada or Les Belles de Ricci you will love this. That said, this bottle was a gift from Influenster for an honest review so honestly... This would not be a perfume I would choose for myself. The scent profile isn't my preference. Also, I really really don't like the name Good Girl. I feel it's a patronizing and infantilizing term especially for anyone who is out of the girl age bracket. I also think the contrast of the name vs. the stiletto shape of the packaging suggested that the term is being using in a sexualize manner. Wear this wile you're watching or reading 50 Shades. If someone asked what I was wearing, I'd hesitate to truthfully reply because telling someone I'm wearing Good Girl is to me, cringey.  I also think we need to hold these brands and manufacturers accountable for the manufacturing. This bottle has a LOT of plastic parts; plastic parts which are not recyclable. I know so many of you comment on how beautiful some packaging is (and I agree!) but it's wasteful."

Good Girl Blush has a gentle medley of vanilla and ylang-ylang. It‚Äôs a sophisticated blend but with a youthful, fun residue.

The signature Carolina shoe design and soft pink colour scheme is quintessential making this perfume an excellent gift choice for your mom or girlfriend. Do not hesitate on this one ladies - shes a keeper !"

It has a powdery Peonies scent with a hint of Bergamot both of which I like... its also got a bit of Vanilla scent (not too stong though which is great). Very feminine!  The bottle looks extremely chic, however the trigger button is placed in such a way that it tends to be a difficult to spray this.  Overall I loved it and am very happy with this product. I received this incentivized product for free in exchange for my honest opinions through the Influenster program and brand Carolina Herrera."

Upon first spray I knew I would love this fragrance it has a beautiful fresh floral scent that just smells delicious and is exactly what I look for the mandarin and ylang ylang paired with the vanilla is such an expensive scent that is perfect for year round but would better as a day fragrance I feel it reminds me of Prada paradoxe which i also love so if your a fan of that smell then you will love good girl blush. There is no powdery smell which can happen with some vanillas and I hate that so I‚Äôm glad it dosent have that it‚Äôs just perfect  will definitely be putting this into my fragrance rotation and using it lots also I will be recommending this to any and off of my friends since it smells so divine  and lasts all day"

First of all, the high heel stiletto shape of the bottle is so beautiful and elegant it stands out on my vanity and it is a show stopper and conversation piece whenever I give people a tour of my apartment and they see it. I am so happy because I love fine perfumes and this one smells so nice and I get so many compliments from my boyfriends and friends, colleagues etc. It smells of florals and a hint of vanilla and smells very delicate and luxurious. My little trick is to put a little bit of Vaseline on my wrist first and find that the scent lasts even longer (I do this with all my perfumes). I also do a little spritz in my hair and get many compliments when wearing this perfume. Also, it is so high quality that a little spritz or two max goes a long way."

It‚Äôs incredibly floral and feminine with a soft powdery finish that holds onto me and really lasts. It‚Äôs reminds me of fresh blooms and just feels pretty. This is beautiful for gifting and one of those statement bottles and generally likeable scents that I would feel confident gifting or be thrilled to receive as a gift.

At first glance the colour and glass bottle is really nice and feminine, would make a fantastic gift for someone. The button to spray is plastic and a bit cheap but it does the job and hasn‚Äôt given me any issue. Unfortunately this fragrance does not smell good on me at all. Being in my early 30s this just smells a bit old and powdery, yet very sweet with vanilla hints. I get no mandarin or ylang-ylang notes from this which I was most excited for. I‚Äôm not sure if this smells bad with my skin chemistry or it‚Äôs just too powdery(and a bit spicy) but I‚Äôm bummed it didn‚Äôt work out for me as I was so excited for it. My mom tried it on, and although it smelled much better on her, she did not like it at all, nor did my dad or boyfriend.

I was wrong, it does!!  The opening is a little powdery, sweet with the first hints of floral. It only takes a minute to settle before the peony and tonka make their appearance. Its subtle at first, then very quickly bold. As it develops on my skin, the other notes become obvious and turns this perfume into a beautiful, sophisticated, womanly dream. The dying breaths of it are a creamy, warm scent with only slight sweetness.   This perfume lasts a LONG time on me - i can still smell it the next day. Spray it on after a shower and moisturizer and it will lock it in. This is the kind of perfume that performs well on heat points. If you need a comparison, think floral Prada Candy"

However, the scent isn‚Äôt doing it for me. I find it‚Äôs quite strong at the outset, not unpleasant but instantly reminds me of the cash area at a Victoria Secret store, just too much all at once and cloyingly sweet. I generally gravitate towards sweeter scents but it‚Äôs just way too much for me and it was overpowering. That being said after a while and as it gets more faint it is nice. It is certainly long lasting but the initial is just too much."

It's a very sweet, powdery, floral perfume that smells very luxurious. I recieved a lot of compliments while wearing this!

			"review_text": "I received the Good Girl Blush perfume by Carolina Herrera free from Influenster and Carolina Herrera as part of the Good Girl Blush VoxBox.   Despite my allergies and sensitivities, I love perfume, the way a scent can invoke feelings and memories is incredible, so I was thrilled to receive this VoxBox and give this scent a try!  This Good Girl Blush is intended to be a lighter version of the original, featuring notes of bergamot (which I adore), citrus (mandarin orange), peony, ylang-ylang, rose water, vanilla, and tonka bean. I was excited by the notes in this perfume, these notes can be easily identified in the scent when on.   I will say while the bottle looks beautiful and fun, I wasn‚Äôt the biggest fan of the mechanics of it. I‚Äôm a spray the perfume in front of you and walk through the mist kind of person and where the trigger is for the bottle doesn‚Äôt really allow for a simple hold on the bottle, you have to kind of hold it sideways and turned a touch. It still works but it‚Äôs not my favourite bottle design from a functionality standpoint.   The trouble with this was that while this is a lighter version to the original after you spray it on the rest of the house also now smells like the perfume making it difficult to differentiate the scent on me directly. The scent is lovely overall but honestly not my favourite one. I didn‚Äôt have any negative interactions with my body chemistry or my allergies, it‚Äôs just a bit too much of a scent for me, it‚Äôs strong. Now it does dissipate as time goes on but overall I‚Äôm personally just not the biggest fan.   If you enjoy the original then you will likely fully enjoy the Blush as well. If you haven‚Äôt tried it, I would recommend getting a sample first before buying a whole bottle.  So in summary, I am grateful to receive this perfume and give it a try. Good Girl Blush is a lovely scent, it‚Äôs just not my overall favourite in my collection. Would I recommend you give it a try yes, it‚Äôs lovely and may just be your fav!"

The Carolina Herrera Good Girl Blush EDP is a very nice, soft floral scent. I think it is perfect to wear for the daytime, especially because it is not too overpowering. The initial floral scent is noticeable for a few hours after applying, and I definitely could pick up on the vanilla notes 7-8 hours later. I think this would also make a wonderful gift for someone, not only for its delicate floral scent, but also the pastel pink stiletto bottle would look beautiful on anyone's vanity.  Thank you to Influenster and Carolina Herrera for letting me test this perfume out! #CarolinaHerrera #Influenster #voxbox #complimentary #perfume #GoodGirlBlush"

It felt warm and inviting & I received many compliments on the days I did wear it out. It has easily become one of my top 3 scents of the year and I will continue to enjoy it throughout this and my next several years. The bottle is sleek, elegant, and a great nod to to the feminine notes found in the actual perfume. I could never wear heels, but having this one in my bag at all times I can tell will significantly increase my confidence. Small note, the button to activate the perfume spray function can be a bit challenging for stiffer fingers or someone struggling with fine motor strength. Otherwise, this is the perfect eau de parfum in our day and age!"

The peony heart after dry-down is incredibly beautiful and compliments the other notes. For scent duration I found one spray lasted the whole day. I sprayed at 6:30AM and by 7PM a family member said they could still smell it on me. As long lasting as it is I noticed I couldn't really smell it after 4 hours - this isn't a bad thing necessarily, but it could lead to feeling of needing to spray more. Don't fall for it!

It's flowery, but sweet at the same time and just so pretty. I think this is very versatile and can be used to go out or just a normal day around the house. I also love the millennial pink color of the bottle, it's a must have collectible bottle! I feel like this is most deff a crowd pleasing scent.

The Good Girl Blush Eau de Parfum comes in a stunning pastel-pink stiletto glass bottle and has a floral scent, both of which exude elegance. The bottle itself is so beautiful, and would look gorgeous on any vanity. The nozzle on the bottle does spray well, and allows for an even spritz.   The notes of the fragrance include mandarin, peony, rose, ylang-ylang and vanilla. The first ingredient on the list is alcohol, and it definitely is very alcohol forward when you first spray it. However, as the alcohol smell dissipates, you're left with a lovely sweet floral scent. It is a very youthful scent, but I think women of all ages can appreciate it. The perfume is supposed to become more intensified with the warmth of your body, and thus, really is meant to be sprayed directly on the skin. I find that when I spray it in the creases of my elbows and behind my ears, the scent lasts all day on me - I have tested it, and it lasts more than 12 hours. However, if I just spritz it on my clothes, the scent fades fairly quickly."

If your looking for something more floral instead of warm or gourmand. This is the one!"

			"review_text": "I find this to be very pretty and different enough from the others. The OG GG DNA is there in the dry down, but I‚Äôd put it at around 40%. This one is sweet, but less sweet than it‚Äôs predecessors. To me, this is a powdery floral on a bed of not quite gourmand vanilla. More like the vanilla of a lotion. I‚Äôm not exactly sure what peony smells like, but I do get a bit of a chalky floral so I imagine that‚Äôs the peony. I can also smell rose, but it‚Äôs not prominent, more of an accent. Overall I feel like this works best for daytime, and can probably work well in any season. Although it may feel heavy in the hottest days due to the sweetness and the powdery aspect. Definitely smell before buying, liking the other good girls does not necessarily mean you will like this. And if you don‚Äôt like powdery fragrances, chances are pretty low that you will like this. To my nose it‚Äôs very different, and has a weirdness to it that‚Äôs proving addictive."
