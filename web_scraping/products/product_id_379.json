Worth the price but lets see how long it lasts."

After trying all three Sol De Janeiro deodorants and hating them, I was about to return to my lame Secret go-to. Was hesitant to try this because of the price but bought it during the sale and I will never look back! This works AND it smells so so so good. It is light, feminine, musky, and creamy. It's subtle enough that it won't interfere with your scent of the day (which is very important to a frangrance-phile like me!). Will likely continue to purchase this baby despite the eyebrow-raising price."

If you dispense too much at a time, the deodorant will break off and crumble.  To stop that, you have to only twist up small amounts at a time but even using that technique there is still lots of product at the end that you cannot use.  For $30+ the dispenser should be better!"
