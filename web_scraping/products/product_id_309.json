It dried the ends of my hair in less than 10 minutes and the rest of my hair was wet/damp but not drenched like it normally is. I have thick long hair for reference and usually takes forever to dry.   I wish the leave in conditioner scent lasted longer because itu2019s beautiful but overall very happy with the effectiveness of the leave in conditioner. It leaves my hair very soft and easy to brush. Iu2019ve used it several times and never leaves my hair greasy. I usually use about 5-6 pumps worth because I have so much hair."

            "review_text": "The leave-in is ok. It smells really nice and I love the glass bottle - it feels very luxe! I have extremely thick, long, relatively coarse hair and was previously using a very rich leave-in cream. I saw this set and decided to give it a shot. I wouldn't re-purchase it, it's just not powerful enough to make a noticeable difference in my hair.   HOWEVER. The towel???? The towel is ELITE. It is shockingly powerful. I have several different microfiber hair turbans that are fine, but eventually they reach capacity and my hair still comes out pretty wet. This towel is like magic. It takes my hair from soaking wet to towel-dried damp in minutes. I put it on right out of the shower, take a few minutes to lotion and add skincare, and by the time I'm finished with that my hair is dry enough to use my leave-ins and other products. I want five more of them."
