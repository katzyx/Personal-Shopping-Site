Will last you a year- just pick up a small fluffy brush and it'll set with minimal product. 0 creases even in crazy hot humid texas weather. haven't noticed an issue with dryness if you use the right concealer- this paired with the lancôme teint idole is my holy grail!! can't wait to try pink once it's back in stock 💗💗"

I’m using it kind of like a finishing and setting powder for my entire face. I don’t really use concealer under my eyes because it’s not a must have for me to correct that area and it tends to break up on me. I guess that area gets kind of oily. I did try this out and added concealer today and it still looks great at 11pm. Maybe this is the product that lets me start using concealer in my routine.  Overall I appreciate the finish this provides to my entire look. I use it with a medium sized powder brush. I just lightly swirl the brush a bit and it picks up. I don’t think the formulation would pick up very well using a powder puff or beauty sponge. It almost feels a little bit spongey and powders with that texture are not a product you should be pressing into or wiping onto to pick up product."

I tried this with different concealers and it gave me the same result with all the ones I used so I know those aren't the problem. Also used different brushes and that didn't help either (including a powder puff).  As a face powder, it does all that it claims to for the under eyes so I'm not mad at it. I don't need a whole lot to set the face and even though it's not a mattifying powder, it keeps my face consistent throughout the day and no extra oils push through. I have a nice dew when I initially apply and set my makeup and it looks pretty much the same by the end of the day. Very nice smoothing and blurring effect.   But $43 for a tiny little face powder? Not sure if it's worth it, especially when it doesn't work well for it's intended purpose. My Hourglass Veil powder gives me more or less the same effect (it's costs more of course, but you get almost double the product for roughly twenty bucks more)."

I was reading some other reviews and I noticed that some people were complaining about the packaging.  I dropped this and it broke, but I think that is my fault.  I mean, I think it would be convenient if makeup was drop proof, but then it would be a lot more expensive.  So I guess I thought, charge it to the game, as it were.  if I hadn't dropped it when it was open, it wouldn't have necessarily broke.  I just think I was rushing to get ready and I messed up.  So I guess I say that to answer the complaint about the packaging.  Now that I am thinking about it, it might be nice to have this in a more substantial compact so that I could put it in my purse and do a touch up when I'm out.  I don't know, I'm still giving it a full five stars because I really like it, but I would not be upset if it came in an old school compact with a mirror and a mini brush.  Anyway,  I have light skin, not the lightest skin, I am a white person with light brown hair and eyes and I just figured I would go with the lightest shade.  I was reading the reviews to see if I should try maybe the medium shade, but I am sticking with this one for now.  I agree that this powder blurs the under eye area and it is good for dark circles.  I use it over my concealer /foundation, and it doesn't look like cakey.  If I hadn't broken it and lost it all, it would have lasted long enough to justify the price.  In my experience, Pat McGrath is worth the money, unlike lots of the really expensive stuff that is out there.  I was out of this powder this weekend and I missed it.  It is part of my must haves now if I'm going to be going out."

So it does provide a definite brightening effect where applied. Two things to be aware of- 1. there is A TON of kickback with this product. I need to gently dab my powder brush into the pan once and I get enough on my brush. If you're used to swirling your brush around to pick up enough powder- you do not need to do so with this powder because it will get everywhere. A very gentle tap into the pan is more than enough. 2. For the price, this component is so painfully cheap. It feels like drug store packaging. The top of the component is curved, and when you open it up, there is this comically small mirror. I don't know why they thought that including this tiny little mirror would be beneficial because it reflect maybe a twentieth of your face. Lastly, as others have said, this powder does break easily since it's so delicate and lightly pressed into the pan. So be extremely cautious not to drop it!"

So, what is with this packaging? It's so cheap. I have a PMG palette and there is a large discrepancy between the two. This feels very drugstore.

I have straight up NOT been a wearer of concealer under my eyes, because I have tried and tried, but could not find a formula with a consistency that didn't magnify my wrinkles and leave my undereye looking even drier. I first learned of this Under-Eye Setting Powder through Patty Alonso's YouTube channel, and hearing her rave about it, I figured I'd try it. My first choice, the shade Light, was out of stock, so I figured I'd try the yellow in hopes that it would neutralize some of the blue where my puffiness is. I bought this product alongside the Skin Fetish Concealer in shade L6 and the Skin Fetish Concealer brush, and had a chance to try all three out for the first time yesterday. The concealer is creamy, comfortable, and spreadable, and when I set my under-eye with this powder, it actually wasn't drying. It just created a subtle, matte blur that kept my concealer in place, crease-free, for at least 10 hours until I washed everything off. This was possibly the first time I was happy with how my undereye area looked since I was 42 and started showing signs of age. Also, I have sensitive, post-LASIK eyes, and this powder was not irritating at all. I'm going to try the Light shade, too, and will likely continue using this product for as long as it exists."

I am a fair/light neutral foundation shade, and I was debating between the light and medium shades. The light does brighten, and I'm worried it will look white in photos. Medium on my fair/light skin was too peachy/orange to use under the eyes. Medium would be best for skin tones that are medium/tan to deep. I wish there was a shade in between light and medium!"

It left my under eyes looking like a disgusting, wrinkly mess. I'm not that old, but it definitely made me look way older! As soon as I banished this powder from my routine and replaced with Chantecaille's HD Blurring Powder things have been much more harmonious under my eyes. This Pat McGrath powder is too thin, it has a sheen to it, which you don't want under your eyes, and it leaves a white cast. It also sucks all the moisture right out of your concealer, which basically shrink wraps the concealer to your texture and wrinkles. I have photo evidence attached. Horrible product."

Although it is a great product I do think it is a bit overpriced for what it is... also, the packaging came with a bunch of loose sequins which I found super annoying and also kind of wasteful.

I used a small, fluffy eyeshadow brush to lightly apply this under eyes and I was pretty amazed at how my under eyes looked. My under eyes are very dry so something like the LM Translucent Loose Setting Powder will accentuate that.   Wore this for around 10 hours and it still looked smooth by the time I was ready to take off my makeup."

There is a ton of kick up with the powder but I just took my time and didn't go crazy with my brush, so it didn't go everywhere. The texture is so beautiful and silky smooth. As for the blurring I don't really see it. it definitely doesn't make more texture under my eye but I was expecting something amazing. It also changed my skin tone about half a shade darker, so i had to end up using it on my entire face or my under eyes would be darker than my face. To be fair I didn't buy the concealer that goes along with it so that could be why I wasn't blown away. It is a decent powder but for the quantity and the price not worth it for me. I will keep reusing it to finish it. I will be going back to my Charlotte Tilbury and Laura Mercier powders though. If it ever goes on sale I might try the light."

It might be because of the milling but you have to be very careful or you will lose a good bit. 3. The amount provided is so little. I don’t expect this to last for more than 2-3 months max. 4.

So lines, texture and dryness are issues for me. I use the lightest shade as this gives me a little bit of a highlight for under my eye (I don’t use a super light colour concealers under my eyes anymore, I save that for the middle area of my face.   I have used this powder with Pat’s concealer, (which is my holy grail medium/full coverage, going out, out concealer)  C’Tillbury, Tarte hydrocealer, Armani (my lighter more day time choices)  and good old drugstore, it works beautifully with all of them. Sets my under eye, makes that area appear smoother, I sneak a bit down my nose, the cheek area next to my nose, it just seems to blur lines/pores so well, without drying my skin out.   Can not rate this enough, me and my older peepers are staying with this fab powder.   But word of warning DON’T drop this powder, it does not like it, it is fragile to a certain degree."

It does an amazing job at setting without drying (something most powders fail to do). in addition to my dry skin, I also have very dark circles under my eyes. So unfortunately I have to use a color corrector and concealer. Because I use both, my makeup will always crease if I don't set it. This powder does an amazing job of setting without drying. It's a little pricey but I would definitely recommend if you've struggled with other powders in the past. I usually prefer to use one powder product for my entire face for the sake of keeping my makeup bag minimal, but because this is an expensive product I have been using this exclusively under the eyes and then using a different powder for helping set concealer over acne spots or toning down the dew from my heckin hydrating cream products. So, downside is I now use two powders, but upside is my under eyes no longer feel like every ounce of hydration has been completely sucked out. Would definitely recommend."

I got this as a set with the concealer and brush and I wanted to give it a fair shake. I use another smaller but fluffy brush to apply this and it goes on completely invisible. The only way I know it applied because it looks like those picture editing blur tools sweeping across my under eye. This powder completely blurs and conceals any pores, lines, creases, etc. and continues to look perfect all day. The powder is lighter than air and is positively magical. I was worried this would be something I wouldn't use often or would even like, but I was taken by surprise and love this. I even use it when I'm just keeping it more natural and use a tinted moisturizer. I was nervous it would show up white or lighten too much, but it works incredibly well. I have been using this daily and definitely plan on keeping this stocked at all times."

I've tried Laura Mercier's and Becca's under-eye setting powders, along with many other hydrating face setting powders. I'm 45 and my under-eye tends to be dry now, even after applying eye cream. It was always a dilemma-if I don't set my concealer, mascara from my bottom lashes smears into the concealer and/or the concealer doesn't stay, but if I t set the area with even a light dusting of powder, my under-eyes looked like the Sahara Desert.  This powder is so finely milled and really does blur the under-eye area wrinkles & creases, and doesn't dry out the area, but still sets the concealer. I also bought the Pat McGrath concealer in #9, and I'm a light to med skin tone, so I bought this in light. I was worried it might be too light, but along with blurring and setting, this powder also brightens the under-eyes. Really impressed. Finally a powder that can set my under-eye area, and make that area look better, not worse!"

Every other powder I have used has made the fine lines under my eyes look at least a bit more dry and pronounced, but not this one. I am so happy with this product!

I got a replacement of course, but very worried about traveling with this. The domed shape is cute and all, but I think this might be more secure as a wider flat compact (like the Charlotte Tillbury powder).

It did not blur my under eye lines but made them more prominent.  I did use this with the concealer. Plus the product size is pretty small but it does come with a working mirror.   I now use it for all over face powder, and it doesn’t oxidase to Orange with my foundation...weird. So I am keeping it because it looks nice all over face versus being under the eye."
