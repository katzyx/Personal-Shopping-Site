My skin is not doing well and I’m worried I’ve developed a bit of an allergic reaction which is actually how I originally came to find this moisturizer.

The moisturizer boasts a delightfully lightweight and silky texture, making it an ideal pick for those who favor a formula that's free from greasiness and won't clog pores. It applies effortlessly and absorbs rapidly, leaving no residue in its wake. This formula is fortified with lotus flower extract, a renowned ingredient for its hydrating and anti-aging benefits. Upon using this moisturizer, I observed an instant boost in my skin's hydration levels. It worked wonders in plumping my skin and diminishing the visibility of fine lines and wrinkles. Having used the Fresh Lotus Youth Preserve Moisturizer for several weeks now, I've noticed a significant transformation in my skin's overall appearance. It's more radiant, smoother, and youthful-looking. I'm also impressed by its ability to balance my skin tone and lessen the visibility of dark spots. If you're on the hunt for a product that will hydrate, nourish, and rejuvenate your skin, this moisturizer is absolutely worth considering."

After a few days of use, my skin was noticeably more smooth and less red. I have eczema and sensitive skin and I was worried at first because I thought it burnt a little bit. After the first few days that went away and my skin is now buttery soft after a couple weeks of using this. It’s SO good and I’m pleasantly surprised with how great this is!!

My thoughts: although this claims to be a lightweight moisturizer, it feels heavy to me. It isn’t as heavy as the overnight version but it’s pretty thick for a daytime cream. If you have dry skin, you will love this! My face actually feels smoother and more moisturized and while it’s thick, I don’t feel any greasiness (my main concern with heavy moisturizers).

It effortlessly glides onto the skin, instantly providing a burst of moisture without any greasy or heavy residue. The subtle floral scent adds a touch of freshness, creating a pleasant and sensorial experience during application.  One of the key highlights of this moisturizer is its powerhouse ingredient, lotus flower extract. Known for its antioxidant properties, lotus extract helps combat free radicals and protect the skin from environmental stressors. Over time, I noticed an improvement in the overall radiance and vitality of my complexion, and my skin appeared more supple and revitalized.  The inclusion of peach leaf extract further enhances the moisturizer's ability to promote a youthful appearance. It aids in maintaining the skin's elasticity and reducing the appearance of fine lines, leaving my skin looking plump and hydrated.  I appreciate that Fresh Lotus Youth Preserve Moisturizer is suitable for all skin types, including sensitive skin. It has proven to be gentle yet effective, making it a versatile choice for a wide range of individuals.  While the price point may be on the higher side, the quality of ingredients and the noticeable results justify the investment. A little goes a long way with this product, ensuring that the jar lasts for an extended period.  In conclusion, Fresh Lotus Youth Preserve Moisturizer has earned its place as a staple in my skincare routine. Its hydrating prowess, combined with the skin-renewing benefits of lotus flower extract, makes it a standout product for those seeking a luxurious and effective moisturizer to pamper their skin."
