It doesn't feel clean and makes me anxious about getting a breakout bc every other cleanser I've used (including the Eradikate one) does not leave a weird film. I was using this as my second cleanse and ended up having to do a third cleanse with something else."

I did have a backup of it but this one intrigued me. I always loved kate sommervilles products and this is no different. Clean nicely without leaving the skin dry and inconfortable while still helping with my acne. I use this as my second cleanse and I really love it☺️"

			"review_text": "So I bought this cleanser a while ago and would use it every two to three days. At first I thought this cleanser was actually causing me to get little whiteheads and maybe that was it’s way of “purging” my skin I’m not sure. Since then I’ve started using this cleanser every morning and OMG it’s made a huge difference in my skin. I get fewer breakouts and my texture is sooo smooth, it’s also so gentle on skin! Doesn’t dry your skin at all!"

I will be buying this cleanser again and again.  My skin feels so smooth and soft after and I notice an amazing difference in my skin.  I haven’t had any breakouts whatsoever and it plays nice with the rest of my skincare.  If you’re looking for a new cleanser you won’t be disappointed."

The texture is almost jelly like but does foam up a bit with water. It doesn't strip your skin or make your skin feel tight after washing which is amazing! It has definitely helped my skin texture and breakouts. So gentle! I think I found my forever cleanser I love this!!"

I've broken out so much over the last 6 months due to stress, hormones, environment etc. I was using so many products my skin couldn't breath. I decided to try this and cut back to just a good cleanser and moisturizer and my skin has gotten much better! I've noticed some acne that has been around for years slowly fade away. Love this product!"
