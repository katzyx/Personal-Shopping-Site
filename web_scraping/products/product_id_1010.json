I will definitely be recommending it to others and repurchasing! The cost is unbeatable and the color (Harmony) is exactly what I have been looking for in a Talc-Free powder bronzer and have yet to find it. Disclaimer: I haven't actually worn this an entire day, but I will probably set it with a powder bronzer, so I think it will wear just fine as it felt and looked great on my skin."

I had heard that it resembles the Benefits Hoola Bronzer that I have always loved.  I bought this as it is described as clean and talc free.  This bronzer is BEAUTIFUL.  I have struggled with finding another bronzer, but this one matches up to the Hoola.  The bronzer blends easily, and really smoothes and matifies the face.  I am someone who puts bronzer all over for a tan look, and it does not look orange at all.  It is long lasting, and pairs wonderfully with the Armani foundation. 100/10 would recommend."

			"review_text": "Currently my favourite bronzer. I was a benefit « Hoola » girl for 3 years but this made me take a sharp turn and revisit my makeup decisions. I put this on my face and immediately after I had finished my makeup, my mom said it looked like I got plastic surgery (In a good way). When I tell you this snatched my cheekbones in, erased my double chin, gave me a nose job, a forehead reduction and put thread lifts in my temples… I feel like I’ve unlocked a higher tier in the makeup community ever since I’ve owned this. It’s very blendable AND layerable. It does not turn me orange (Listen…We’ve all been there.) or gray like some other products do. I use a singular dollar store brush I purchased a decade ago to do my entire face, so this is obviously the work of the bronzer and not the brush. This is easily better than a high end bronzer some other companies can provide. For 26$ CAD, I’m more than happy, It has the consistency of something an uber brand would sell for triple the value. Not once did I notice a break out in relation to this product, that and the fact that it has only improved since I’ve discovered this. I was part of the cheek acne gang and I will attribute this to the benefit bronzer. Only issue I’ve ran into is the packaging (The compact). Now halt in your tracks and listen to me LYS : I was super impressed, first by the quality of the mirror, it is not warped, does not present scratches, unevenness or cloudiness, very nice job on this often overlooked aspect. Second, it feels nice in the hand and it’s lightweight, the exterior is sleek and simple. When I reach blindly into my makeup bag, I know I’m looking for my beloved equilateral triangle. And then the lovely magnetic mechanism, so useful for those of us with minimal arm strength and brittle nails who simply cannot apply turn into the Hulk and pry our compacts open. But your greatest strength is your only weakness ; The magnet completely broke on me. I don’t know how, why, when, where it went wrong. I p"

A bit of setting spray is needed to make it transfer resistant  I can dust this on with a brush and blend in with a wet beauty blender for no-foundation days, right over a freshly primed face. It blurs over a powdered face and it's buildable for glam looks. It can also be used as an eyeshadow or blended from the temple to the eyes to make my makeup seamless. I typically use this to warm up my forehead, chin and to hug my cheeks. It also bodes well to the 70's style of bronzer application by using a large brush to blend across the cheeks, hairline, nose, chin and jawline.  Overall, a solid performing bronzer with great undertones for a great price."

The formula is amazing, NO scent, huge plus for me. It did not accentuate my pores. The con is that it can have a slight orange hue if you go heavy handed. It's quite powdery and easy on the brush bristles you use.  If they had more shades, with different undertones, other would benefit from this brand and not complain about the orange tinge it gives off on the skin."

I have a golden olive undertone, so lots of bronzers on the market look like straight up blush on me--way too red and orange. The shade range of these bronzers is gorgeous and without having a huge number of shades. Courage is a perfect, toasty brown. The perfect balance of neutral and warm to look naturally sun-kissed. The formula is buttery smooth but lightweight. It blends like a dream, so it looks natural even on bare skin. It builds up and sheers out easily. And it manages to do all that without silicone, which irritates my skin. So grateful for LYS! I'm not even interested in trying other bronzers at the moment, this just satisfies everything I could ask for in a powder bronzer.  Also love the unique packaging, relatively affordable price tag, that it's created and owned by a Black woman make up pro, and the self-love branding. Cherries on top!"

It has a slight yellow under tone but goes really well with my natural skin color to make my skin look sunkissed in a very natural way. Its very buildable Which I like in a bronzer. Its not overly pigmented. Its a very soft and blendable powder the is easy to apply and seamless when blended out. I really love this! It has become my go to bronzer! It's so easy to use and I love that I have control over how deep I want the color to look. It's not powdery at all its very creamy in texture without actually being a cream. I love how it blends into the skin and not on top of the skin. It just performs so well and is so aesthetically pleasing to look at. Love this and can't wait to pick up more from this brand!"

Almost all bronzers pull way too orange on me (or have shimmer) and the ones that have cooler tones are for light skin tones and I’m medium so they’re way too light. This was PERFECT. Not too orange, just right. It blends beautifully and is just the right pigmentation to give my face the structure and color it needs.  The packaging is to die for from the cute shape, the chrome color and a mirror inside is always a bonus for me.  The cherry on top of it all is this price point! I’ve used everyone’s HG from Benefit and paid that hefty price for a little amount of bronzer that barely showed on my skin and wasn’t even all that great. This right here is definitely holy grail status for me!"

They also have such a positive and warm approach in an industry that capitalizes off of insecurity (all the names they use convey a message).  I have a very warm skin tone, and the color Harmony leans more neutral in person than it does in pictures. Since it's cooler than my olive skin tone, I like to use this bronzer for a subtle nose contour on lighter makeup days.  I have a lot of pricier products, and this one is definitely one of my favorites and feels like a high quality product. I'm so glad I bought it, and it has the perfect amount of product, although there is a slight learning curve for me with the triangle shaped pan. I wish Sephora stocked it in-store so more people could try it out because it is amazing. If people saw it with their own eyes, I think they'll see what I see in it. So excited to see what LYS does next!"

			"review_text": "I was nervous to try this as the image seemed a bit orange and that's always been my problem when finding a bronzer for my light/medium neutral skintone. I only require it during the summer months and didnt want to spend a fortune and I use exclusively clean beauty products...this checked ALL the boxes. The only thing left was to try and see if it turned me shiny or orange and it absolutely did not! It's totally buildable so I dont find that I regret using it after 1 swipe...its goes on easy and provides a natural tan finish without any shine (another box checked for me!!). Can't say enough good things, the price, the colour, the finish, the size (super adorable packaging btw) it does what I need it to very well. I'm so glad I took a chance on this new brand."

It suits the darker shadows of my face and makes my face appear more structured. I woudn't call this bronzing however, as it is not warm in undertone, but rather very cool undertone. The staying power is decent and the pigment upon application is very noticeable."

Builds and blends beautifully.   This could be a foundation shade for some, it's why I took a star off. I feel it needs more warm (like saffron) GOLDEN in it. Yes, on lighter skin tones a neutral bronze gives a tanned appearance and would be perfect, but on a deeper tone, it's not so much a tan than we get from the sun, so much as it is a glow. I find myself helping out the product  With an almond colored loose powder.  Also shade is needed between strength and worthy. Worthy is pretty much a foundation shade on me and Strength is a too dark."
