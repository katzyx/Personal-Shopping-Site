Once I blow dry, my hair is so soft and so SHINY! It is a bit expensive, but the bottle is really big. Lasts a long time!!  Love it - definitely recommend :)"

He does not recommend using this on dry hair as a refresher. This can lead to dry crunchy hair with a lot of build up like some of the reviews below are experiencing.   He only recommends using this on wet hair.  Mist the hair. Less is more. You do not need a lot of product and brush it through your hair to avoid texture. Even the best products used incorrectly will make your hair feel terrible. I recommend checking him out."

I dont  use dry shampoo so if you do, you can go longer between washes. I don't like the floral smell though. Wish they would change it or remove it altogether."

While washing, my hair it became a dry tangled mess a minute it so or so after applying. I could not brush through my hair with my wet brush. It felt like nothing I’ve experienced before. I was tearing through my hair trying to comb through with my fingers to rinse it out, but it seemed to just keep getting worse. I eventually just washed it out with shampoo and thankfully my hair was ok again as soon as it was washed out. I have finer, dry hair naturally. This is not the product for you if your hair is similar."

She spoke wonders about it and just had to try it out myself, since I was looking for a good lightweight leave-in conditioner. I wasn’t sure if it would work for my rather thick, wavy and frizz-prone hair (since the influencer’s was thin and straight), but it’s amazing. I’ve loved how smooth my hair has felt after using it and how easy it is to detangle it. I’m so glad that it already has heat protectant included, so I don’t have to buy or carry around another product. I just love it. Highly recommended!!"

It makes my hair feel silky for days after washing."

I don’t think this did anything crazy for my hair, it did seem to provide good heat protection though. I think there are better, more moisturizing leave ins that i would use instead of this. Proceed with caution because i have never had breathing issues until i used this leave in, and the second i stopped using it my breathing has been normal!"

It used to be a bit dry and damaged from some subtle highlights and heat damage, but now my hair is noticeably softer and healthier looking! I have less frizz and my curls look pretty defined and hydrated. Btw I use a redken shampoo and conditioner, the Ouai curl cream and Kerastase hair oil on my ends. I have found that the combination of all these products has given me the best hair ever! I also love the smell of this conditioner."
