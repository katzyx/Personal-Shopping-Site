			"review_text": "I'm honestly surprised to see all the negative reviews on this product, I loved it and my review is not incentivized! I've been on a perimenopausal change in hair texture (I used to have silky, fine hair that has become much drier and wirier) and density journey, and I've been trying every moisturizing or deep conditioning product I can get my hands on! I have been a Briogeo girl for a while now, but I tried this product on a whim and it is my new favourite!! My hair felt softer and looked shinier after using this, and I also appreciate the mild, more natural scent. Of course, everyone's hair is different, but based on my experience, this product is definitely worth a try if you're dealing with similar hair concerns!"

			"review_text": "Awful… just awful! I don’t care what hair texture you have, I don’t see how this stuff could provide any moisture to your hair at all. The texture of the product is super weird and almost has a drying effect (the complete opposite of moisturizing). The best way I can describe it is like dish liquid, after you scrub a glass and get it literally squeaky clean, that’s how your fingers feel when you rub them together with this product on them. It provides ZERO slip, your hairs screech apart and snap when you part your hair. It caused my hair to become a tangled mess and dried it out even more. I don’t recommend this junk to ANYONE, especially not to people with textured or curly hair and certainly not for those with dry hair, God forbid you compound the problem with this crap. Incentivized reviews are destroying quality control and manufacturer accountability in this country!"

			"review_text": "Yeah it didn’t give my hair what it needed considering its claims and the reviews. It’s very clear to me that this whole line is catered to straight and maybe wavy hair, but certainly not curly let alone coily hair. NOTHING hydrating came from this line.   •When I used the shampoo, which was NOT hydrating, I had to use another more moisturizing shampoo afterwards.  •When I used the conditioner, I used the oil to help aid in the hydration and remove shedded hair. No slip at all and I was losing a lot of hair.  •When I used this intense mask, I ended up layering MELANIN’s conditioner on top for maximum hydration. I sat under the dryer for 35 minutes and had such soft hair. Everything I did, I had to use something else behind it. Sucks.   I do recommend this but only to straighter textures, not textures that NEED actual moisture."

For Asian hair, I would suggest Shu Uemura hair masks (any of moisturizing ones and the best is Ultimate Reset Masque), which Sephora doesn’t carry them. They gave me the smoothest hair without weighing it down."

This mask is lovely texture-wise - it detangled my hair beautifully and left it feeling soft and silky. However, there are two issues: 1. It smells horrible - a super strong, plasticky, cheap floral scent; and 2. I think it's really silly to put a hair mask that's meant to be used after shampooing in a jar! It would be so much more convenient for shower use if it came in a tube. I've seen online that this product used to have a more unique fragrance and came in a tube - I'm disappointed that I never got to try that version."

First time I tried it I was SHOOK. My curls and waves were hydrated, bouncy, and shiny. I am careful to use this only 1-2 times per month, but every time I use it I have the BEST hair day.

The only thing keeping me from giving this product 5 stars is the packaging. I also think I might have to skip on repurchasing simply because of the packaging as well too. The lid is so hard to fully shut so the product is always a little bit open, which I hate. I also find it to make a bit of a mess as well due to the packaging.

My ONLY downside is the packaging... It's *so* cheap and flimsy. There's this weird plastic cover underneath the lid (think mason jar) and it always falls in and is really hard to get back out.

I recently found The Nurture Intense Hydration Hair Mask by JVN and I've been trying it out, and wanted to wait on the results before leaving a review. I can honestly say that my skepticism battled with my hope as I tried it for the first time, but this mask shattered my doubts and exceeded my expectations. Having suffered the disappointment of terrible masks again and again, the noticeable change that the JVN mask brought about was genuinely astonishing. My hair, once as brittle as straw and prone to snapping, now looks and feels alive. The texture transformed, it's luxuriously soft and it's super bouncy. Running my fingers through my hair feels incredible. What truly sets the Nurture Intense Hydration Hair Mask apart is its ability to deliver on its promises without draining your wallet. Unlike previous high-priced letdowns, this mask offers a genuine transformation that makes every penny that I spent more than worth it. I've tried countless of low priced and high priced hair masks, and they either did not work at all or barely worked. For the price point, barely wasn't good enough for me. But JVN blew me away, the price point and the results go hand in hand.  if your hair needs a pick me up, try this mask NOW!"

As someone who has struggled with dry and brittle hair, this mask has been an absolute game-changer in my hair care routine.  From the very first use, I noticed a significant improvement in the texture and overall health of my hair. The mask's rich and creamy formula coats each strand, providing deep hydration and nourishment from root to tip. The combination of powerful ingredients, such as argan oil, shea butter, and coconut oil, work together to penetrate deeply into the hair shaft, replenishing moisture and restoring vitality.  What sets the JVN Nurture Intense Hydration Hair Mask apart is its ability to deliver long-lasting results. After rinsing out the mask, my hair felt incredibly soft, silky, and manageable. Even after days of styling and exposure to environmental stressors, my hair maintained its newfound hydration and shine. No more frizz or dryness to worry about!  The versatility of this mask is another aspect I truly appreciate. While it's recommended to leave it on for 5-10 minutes, I often opt for a longer treatment by wrapping my hair in a warm towel to allow the mask to deeply penetrate my strands. Whether you have a few spare minutes or want to indulge in a self-care session, this mask can be tailored to fit your needs.  I must also mention the delightful scent of this hair mask. The subtle floral and coconut notes create a luxurious and pampering experience each time I use it. It's a small detail, but one that adds to the overall enjoyment of the product.  Lastly, I appreciate that the JVN Nurture Intense Hydration Hair Mask is free from sulfates, parabens, and harsh chemicals. As someone who prioritizes clean beauty, it's reassuring to know that I'm treating my hair to a product that is both effective and gentle."

			"review_text": "JVN's Nurture Intense Hydration Hair Mask is a powerful and effective treatment that delivers much-needed moisture and nourishment to dry and damaged hair. As someone with fine, heat-damaged hair, I was impressed with my results. The hydrating properties of this hair mask are remarkable. This mask provided me with intense hydration from root to tip, and after rinsing, my hair felt significantly softer and smoother. Despite being so rich and nourishing, the mask didn't weigh down my hair. It left my locks feeling voluminous and bouncy, which is often a challenge with deeply hydrating products.   In my opinion, this is a top-notch treatment for anyone seeking to revive their dry and damaged hair. Its deep hydrating and restorative benefits make it an excellent choice for regular use, especially for those with color-treated or heat-damaged hair. I highly recommend this hair mask for anyone looking to add moisture, shine, and strength back into their locks."

Living in Houston with all of this heat and humidity makes it hard to maintain smooth, sleek, and hydrated hair. The sun is really harsh and the humidity puffs my hair within minutes of leaving my home. The JVN Nuture Hydrating Shampoo cleansed my hair without stripping the moisture. My hair was already soft and supple before applying the mask/conditioner. Once I applied the mask, the texture of it was everything. It was very thick and rich and absorbed into my hair seamlessly. My curls felt like silk like rinsing. The dry down of my hair was very soft and moisturized before applying any product. Once my hair was blown out and flat ironed, the softness, the flow, and the lightness of my hair was everything! This was also the longest I was able to maintain smoothness to my straight hair during the summer. I couldn’t recommend these products enough!"

I kept this mask on for about 15 minutes with a plastic cap over my head and when I went to rinse it out, my curls started to pop like never before. Not only that, but my leave-on conditioner did not have to work nearly as hard to keep my hair moisturized! Overall, I'm obsessed with the look and feel of my hair!"

This works so as a conditioner or just a mask. It has a good scent (like straight out of the salon) and it’s thick consistency could coat my hair.  That being said, it is thicker than the hair masks I’ve tried so it does stick to the skin upon washing it off. But scrubbing it off with a loofah will help.  Great product, JVN Hair!"

I was shocked that this is a silicone-free formula, as I usually I don't get these kinds of results without silicone.  The texture of the mask is creamy, almost custard-like. The scent was a very luxurious blend of floral and fruity notes. This scent may be a little strong for those sensitive to strong fragrances however, it did not bother me.  First, I used the JVN Nuture Hydrating Shampoo on my roots. Then I went in with this mask and applied it from the middle, down to the ends of my hair. This mask made it easy to detangle my hair in the shower. It felt very silky as soon as I rinsed out the product. After my hair was dry, I was able to comb through it with ease. This also made maintaining my hair for the next few days easier. My hair was shiny and felt so smooth. It noticeably had less frizz as well. My results lasted about 2 or 3 days before my hair needed to be washed again.  Thank you again to JVN for the opportunity to review!"

			"review_text": "I've tried several other hair masks before, but none of them come close to the performance of JVN's Nurture Intense Hydration Mask, it’s an absolute game-changer for my hair! During the summer months, the heat can be very brutal leaving my hair is dry and brittle so this hair mask had a lot to prove. First of all, the texture of the product is incredibly smooth and creamy, making it easy to apply and spread throughout my hair. It feels luxurious and high-quality, just like something you'd find in a high-end salon.  The color and smell of the product are delightful. The mask has a fresh and salon-like fragrance that instantly elevated my shower hair care routine. I applied the mask in the shower for the recommended time and after rinsing it out my hair felt amazingly silky and easy to comb through. It was like the tangles and knots were just melting away with each comb stroke. I felt like it was a dream come true for my curly hair since it often gets tangled.   The transformation was truly remarkable. It felt so much smoother, and the frizziness was significantly reduced. My curls looked more defined and bouncy, and the overall shine was incredible. My hair went from being dull, dry, and brittle to feeling soft, healthy, and hydrated. The results were immediate.  Comparing my hair before and after using the product, the difference was night and day. Before, my hair lacked life and vitality, but after using the JVN Nurture Intense Hydration Mask, it was like my hair had been rejuvenated. I noticed a significant improvement in the texture and look of my hair from the first use itself.  What impressed me the most was how fast and easy it was to use this mask. I like that it didn't require a long waiting time nor was it complicated. This product truly stands out because it delivers on its promises. The hydration it provides is unmatched, and the way it nourishes split ends is remarkable. I can confidently say that this mask is superior to any other I've used in the past."

The product made my hair incredibly easy to comb through, which is hard to accomplish with my wavy and frizzy hair!   Once blow dried, my hair was noticeably smoother, less frizzy, and felt incredibility nourished. Compared to other masks I've used before, this one stood out because of the instant results. Just a few minutes and my hair looked and felt transformed!  The best part was the longevity of the results. Even after three days, my hair retained its shine and continued to feel soft and manageable. This mask is now a staple in my hair care routine, and I highly recommend it to anyone seeking intense hydration and restoration for their hair. Truly a game-changer, especially for the great price!"

The texture of the mask was creamy and thick, which helped to smooth the product onto my hair easily. The smell was mild and pleasant.   When I rinsed out the mask, my hair felt softer and more manageable. After blow-drying, my hair was noticeably smoother, shinier, and less frizzy.

I'll walk you through my experience with this product step by step: First off, I gotta say, the texture of this hair mask is incredible! It's so creamy and luxurious, making it super easy to apply evenly all over my hair. And guess what? It doesn't feel heavy or greasy at all, which is a big plus for me. Oh, and the color is this lovely pearly white, and the smell... oh, the smell! It's got this amazing floral fragrance that lingers in my hair even after I've dried it. I'm a total fan of the scent!Now, in the shower, this hair mask worked like magic. As soon as I started applying it, my hair instantly felt silkier and smoother. Detangling was a breeze, seriously! I could easily comb through my hair without any painful tugging.After I dried my hair, I couldn't believe the difference! My hair felt so much smoother, and the annoying frizz was significantly reduced. Plus, the shine it gave my hair was like a bonus! Speaking of before and after, the contrast was remarkable. In my after pic my hair is 4 days unwashed. Still they feel soft and smooth.  Before using the JVN Intense Hair Mask, my hair felt dry and dull, but afterward, it was like it came back to life! It had this bounce and vibrancy that I hadn't seen in a while.Now, what really impressed me was how fast and easy it was to use this hair mask. My hair felt so much better in such a short time. And guess what? The shine and smoothness lasted for up to four days! I couldn't believe it; I kept checking my hair in the mirror, and it still looked fantastic! That's some long-lasting goodness right there."

I've struggled with dry and lifeless hair for a long time, but this product turned my hair care routine around and gave me the hair of my dreams.  From the start, I was impressed with JVNHair's attention to detail, evident from the moment I received the package. The packaging was not only visually appealing but also practical, ensuring the product arrived in perfect condition. As I opened the jar, a refreshing and invigorating scent greeted me, immediately igniting my excitement to try it out.  The Nurture Intense Hydration Mask itself is a luxurious, creamy formula that glided effortlessly through my hair. Following the instructions, I applied it after shampooing, and to my surprise, the mask instantly melted into my hair, delivering an instant burst of hydration. What impressed me the most was that it didn't weigh my hair down or make it greasy, something I had worried about with other hair masks.  As I let the magic happen, I noticed a wonderful lightness in my hair, a feeling I hadn't experienced in a long time. The nourishing blend of ingredients seemed to work wonders, leaving my strands looking healthier and feeling incredibly soft.  After the recommended time, I rinsed out the mask, and the results were nothing short of astounding! My hair felt like pure silk, and the hydration was unlike anything I had ever experienced. The mask had penetrated deep into each strand, visibly revitalizing my hair with a newfound shine and bounce that I thought was lost forever.  What truly set JVNHair's Nurture Intense Hydration Mask apart was its long-lasting effects. Even after multiple washes, my hair retained the nourishment and moisture, staying manageable and frizz-free. I also noticed a significant reduction in split ends, a clear sign of the mask's ability to repair and strengthen damaged hair."

After my hair dried it looked and felt softer, smoother, had less frizz and was easier to style. I continue to use this product for a couple of weeks and I have seen a complete transformation in my hair. My hair is completely hydrated, soft, nourished, has less breakage, split ends are improved, and my hair has an overall healthy look that's freeze free and full of shine. This hydration mask has been completely different than any other hair mask I've ever tried, as the results are incredible, happen very fast, are long-lasting and my hair does not get weighed down. Overall,I would highly recommend this mask to anyone that just wants to have shinier, hydrated, nourished, strong and healthy hair."

This mask was super hydrating and didn’t leave my hair feeling heavy which I’ve noticed happens with other brands I’ve used. It was easy to comb through and didn’t leave any weird residue on my body during my shower. My hair instantly felt smoother and softer when i got out of the shower and less dry and brittle. I noticed results immediately after my first use as well and the shine on my hair has lasted for 3 days now. This is my new go-to hair mask!! You can see in my photo on the left how dry it looked and the next day on the right it had more shine and looked healthier! Also I have naturally auburn hair and I don’t know if it’s just me but the color even looks better on the right compared to the left!"

Opening the mask up it looks really thick, but it glides onto the hair really nicely. I like that this mask was easier to disperse evenly throughout my hair than other masks I’ve tried without having to use as much product. The scent is musky but quite light. It smells genderless and quite sophisticated. I was pleased to note that the scent lasted all the way until my next hair wash. While I don’t think my hair looked any different after using it, it definitely felt different. It was much silkier and softer and I didn’t have my usual issue with tangles the following 2-3 days after using it. Immediately my hair was more manageable than usual. I didn’t feel like this weighed my hair down and I was still able to get a nice bend in my blowout afterwards."

No exaggeration - after a single use of the JVN Nurture Hydrating shampoo AND especially the Intense Nurture Hydrating Mask my hair was less poofier, less frizzy, and finally started to have a more natural wave to it (my hair is treated).   The Nurture Intense Hydration Mask has a super silky soft texture which is easy to spread on my thick hair. I don’t have to use too much product. This particular line does have a slightly more masculine scent in my opinion but not overpowering after use so I don’t mind it! I wash my hair every other day and it usually gets noticeably oily by 2nd day but not with the mask.   Definitely recommend for people with frizzy ends & super dry hair like me!"

As someone with afro-textured hair, I have always struggled to find hair products that truly address my unique hair needs. Let's start with the shampoo – it has been a game-changer for my hair care routine. The use of hemi-squalane, a light oil often substituted for silicone, is truly remarkable. Unlike many other shampoos designed for afro-textured hair, this one effectively cleanses without stripping away natural oils or leaving a heavy residue. The hemi-squalane's ability to combat frizziness is nothing short of impressive, and it has significantly improved the manageability of my hair. Even after rinsing, my locks feel soft, smooth, and deeply moisturized. The real magic, however, happens when I pair the JVN Intense Hydration Mask with the shampoo. This combination is nothing short of a blessing for my hair. The mask's formula, enriched with hemi-squalane, keeps my hair moisturized for days on end."

Applying it in the shower was simple and easy to comb through. I left it in for about 4 minutes and when rinsing it out, my hair immediately felt smoother. I have fairly thick hair and a lot of hair and this product really changed the game. After my hair dried, I saw a reduction of frizz especially at my ends. I air dried my hair and did not apply heat till the 3rd day and my hair has stayed shiny throughout. Even after using heat my hair was still very shiny and smooth. This mask is my new addition to my weekly routine because of the visible results I saw with the first wash and how easy it was to obtain these results. This mask is easy to use and will last so long due to the amount you get in the package."

The texture was like conditioner (normal), the color a light yellow, and smelled like a hair product (nothing notable or special). It felt like normal conditioner in my hair, nothing extra ordinary. However, once I towel dried my hair, I did feel it a bit drier than usual which was odd since this is supposed to hydrate. I didn’t use any after-shower products on my hair to really feel the use of this mask, perhaps that’s why it felt drier? I also paired with the shampoo. Maybe it’s my hair type (very curly). I do like that it’s “work time” is only 3-5 minutes which is more doable than other masks. I tried it again a few days later and same not-noticeable results. I will say it came packaged great and bottles are nice."

			"review_text": "I recently had the pleasure of trying out the JVN Nurture Intense Hydration Hair Mask, and I must say, it exceeded my expectations. As someone with dry and damaged hair, I am always on the lookout for products that can provide deep hydration and rejuvenation, and this hair mask definitely delivered.  First and foremost, the texture of the product is luxuriously creamy, making it easy to apply evenly throughout my hair. The scent is also delightful, with a subtle and refreshing fragrance that lingers without being overpowering.   The real magic happened once I left the mask on for the recommended amount of time. The formula is packed with nourishing ingredients, such as argan oil and shea butter, which worked wonders in moisturizing my hair from root to tip. I could feel the mask deeply penetrating my strands, leaving them noticeably softer and more manageable.   After rinsing off the mask, I was thrilled to find that my hair was incredibly hydrated and visibly healthier-looking. It had a renewed shine and bounce that I hadn't seen in a while. I also appreciated that the effects of the mask lasted for several days, meaning I didn't have to use it as frequently as some other products I've tried.  Another aspect that impressed me was the packaging. The JVN Nurture Intense Hydration Hair Mask comes in a sturdy and attractive container, making it easy to store and travel with. The instructions on the label were clear and concise, ensuring that I used the product correctly and got the most out of it.  Overall, I wholeheartedly recommend the JVN Nurture Intense Hydration Hair Mask to anyone in need of a boost in hair hydration. With its nourishing formula, delightful scent, and visible results, it has become a staple in my hair care routine. Thanks to this hair mask, my locks have never looked or felt better."

Here's my review of the product:  Firstly, let's talk about the texture, color, and smell of the hair mask. The texture was creamy and rich, making it easy to apply evenly throughout my hair. It had a pleasant, light consistency that didn't weigh my hair down. The color was a soft, pearly white, which gave it a clean and fresh appearance. As for the smell, it had a delightful, subtle fragrance that was not overpowering. It left a pleasant scent lingering in my hair even after rinsing.  While using the hair mask in the shower, I immediately noticed how silky and smooth my hair felt. It provided excellent slip, making it effortless to comb through my strands without any tugging or resistance. This made detangling a breeze, and I appreciated the reduced breakage and stress on my hair.  Once my hair dried, I was thrilled with the immediate results. My hair felt noticeably smoother and had significantly less frizz than before using the mask. It had a healthy shine to it, making my locks look vibrant and lustrous. The split ends appeared nourished and less pronounced. Overall, my hair looked and felt incredibly soft, healthy, and hydrated.  In terms of the duration of the results, I was pleased to see that the shine and improved condition of my hair lasted up to three days after using the hair mask. Even on the third day, my hair maintained a healthy and shiny appearance, which was impressive. However, it's worth mentioning that individual results may vary based on hair type, environmental factors, and personal hair care routines.  I have tried various hair masks in the past, but this particular one stood out to me for a few reasons. Firstly, the Triple Hydration System truly delivered on its promise of providing instant hydration and restoring smoothness. The mask seemed to penetrate deeply into my hair, providing long-l"
