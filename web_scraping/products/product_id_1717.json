I started using pumpkin seed oil about a year or so ago, which has helped a lot. However, this shampoo amped up rhe growth level! I wasn't expecting that, I bought it because it was a bar and had good ingredients (I am extra sensitive to stuff). Didn't even pay attention to the benefits of the rice water until my hair began to feel more lush. The scrunchy I could comfortably wrap twice, I can now only wrap once. I attribute new growth to this stuff. Nothing else in my routine changed, so yeah, it's this stuff. On my third bar. fyi-- I have color treated hair and my color looks great, still."

The SCENT, oh my goodness the scent is incredible it’s not too overwhelming but it is so comforting and fresh. My hair felt clean and fresh afterwards which is exactly what you want from a shampoo! I have never tried a shampoo bar before this one and it defineitly makes me consider switching over I only worry about how to store it and it running out pretty quick"

			"review_text": "Details: Created with Longsheng Rice water & all natural ingredients to moisturize, strengthen, rejuvenate & cleanse scalp & hair while leaving it shiny & renewed. This bar uses the same rice water prepared in the same way as the Red Yao have done for centuries. Additionally, Viori works with the Red Yao to purchase their ancient rice at a premium to create a long-term, sustainable partnership. Did I mention too that this shampoo bar is sulfate, paraben, plastic & phthalates-free, is pH balanced, 100% vegan & cruelty-free.    My experience: For reference, I have thick hair that easily weighed down by heavy products with more shedding. I have been trying to use more shampoo bars as I love that they are better for the environment & reduce waste. This shampoo bar is beautifully made (look at that design 😍) & has a delicious scent with subtle hint of vanilla & musky/herbal hints. This gently lathers & leaves my hair clean without feeling stripped. I can’t yet speak to my hair feeling stronger but my hair looks shiny & has more volume. I can’t wait to see what long term use will bring.  Overall: I am happy to have found a great shampoo bar that not only cleanses my hair & makes it shiny & adds volume but also reduces environmental waste, is sustainable & creates a long-term partnership with their suppliers. Thank you Viori for sending me this incredible new shampoo bar, I will definitely have to get the conditioner to see how it works together."

I curled my hair with hot rollers after allowing my hair to air dry and I had nice volume. This doesn’t seem to have weighed down my hair. This will be especially great for traveling!  I’d be interested in the bamboo holder to better preserve and store the bar. Mine was a square, unlike the round ones in the photo, so not sure if it will fit in their bar holders."

I have fairly thick hair and it made the top of my head more greasy looking the day after using it, so I would advise to apply at the ends of your hair if your hair tends to get greasy like mine.

I have very long dry hair, and I felt like I was struggling to fully distribute it through my hair and get enough slip to work through any tangles. After using it, my hair did not feel as moisturized as I would normally expect from a conditioner, and if anything, it felt a bit dryer. I wish it had worked better for me, but it may work better for those with shorter hair that is less prone to dryness."

My hair didn’t get super super dry which tends to happen because it is very blonde and it’s bleached blonde. The smell is really lovely definitely very musky so you would have to like a musky scent it lathers really well and it’s great that you don’t have to worry about any plastic packaging. This is a great shampoo bar to travel with as well. I am very happy with this. I have been wanting to try this brand for a while, but I was hesitant due to the fact that I’ve had so many issues with othershampoo bars, but I have finally found one that I think is worth the money."

This musky, sweet, vanilla-scented shampoo bar not only transports you to the enchanting Longsheng waterfalls with its amber aroma but also delivers on its promises of natural beauty and sustainability.  One of the standout features of this shampoo bar is its use of Longsheng Rice, a traditional ingredient and beauty secret of the Red Yao community for centuries. Knowing that it’s handcrafted with the same natural ingredients and beauty rituals used by the Red Yao adds a layer of authenticity and cultural appreciation to the product."

			"review_text": "For the past 7 months I have been letting my gray hair grow in. I am 39 years old and absolutely love my gray. The bad part is my hair was so damaged with bleaching/dying/heat treatments. While researching best (natural) shampoo/conditioners - Viori was a consistent result. Since using Viori, my scalp is healthier with no build-up, my hair is VERY noticable shiner and stronger. I never thought my split-ends would be controlled but - my hair stylist told me she has never seen my hair so healthy before. Prior to Viori, I never heard of shampoo/conditioner bars, yet I threw caution to the wind and haven't looked back. These bars last 2x's longer (for me) than the previous bottle products I used. Even better - I love a company that gives back. With each sale, a % goes back to the Red Yao tribe, where they get the rice to make the shampoo/conditioner. Did I forget to tell you this is Vegan - Sulfate Free - Paraben Free?! I will always recommend the Viori products, and now my beautician does as well. They have something for all hair types but my favorite is Hidden Waterfall scent. It's sweet with hints of vanilla and a touch of amber. Warm would be a good way to describe it. I wet my hair, rub the bar around my scalp (maybe 4 big circles), scrub like normal then rinse. Then I rub the bar on the ends of my hair and let it sit while I shave or sing my favorite song. Following my mini concert, I do 2 scalp circles with the bar, rub everything in and do a final rinse. On this rinse I do a cool water rinse. Not required, just personal preference. Try it - Give it a week - You will never look back!"

You can really tell that it is a product with rice in it from the scent which I find to be actually nice. The scent kind of reminds me of those scented soaps that my aunt or grandma would have in their bathrooms in the 1990s that were there simply for decoration.  When I first lathered the bar in my hands I wasn't getting much and at first worried it wouldn't be conditioning enough for my hair so I took the bar directly to my hair and the product glided right on leaving smooth silky conditioner on my hair. I focused on the ends and worked up the length of my hair avoiding my scalp area. I am really impressed with how silky it felt with the conditioner in my hair. When I rinsed, my hair still felt silky but not like the conditioner wouldn't wash out. I let my hair air dry and I was able to brush my hair without any tangles which is a really rare thing for me being that I have super fine hair that tangles from simply shaking my head! I am really impressed with how well the conditioner bar works for giving hair moisture and what it did for my fine hair and tangles. It isn't heavy at all either."

			"review_text": "Certainly! Here's a simulated review for the VIORI Hair Shampoo Bar that you might find at a place like Sephora:  ---  Title: A Game-Changer for My Hair and the Environment!  Rating: ★★★★★ (5/5)  I recently decided to switch to a more sustainable hair care routine and stumbled upon the VIORI Hair Shampoo Bar at Sephora. I was a bit skeptical at first, wondering how a bar could possibly replace my liquid shampoo, but I'm so glad I gave it a try!  First off, the packaging is minimal and eco-friendly, which I absolutely love. There's no plastic involved, and it feels great to reduce my environmental impact. The bar itself is easy to use—just a few swipes across my wet hair and it lathers up beautifully.  The scent is divine! It's fresh and not overpowering, leaving my hair smelling amazing for hours. But the real magic is in how my hair feels and looks after drying. My hair has never felt softer or looked shinier. I have noticed a significant reduction in frizz, and my hair feels healthier overall. Plus, the bar lasts so long, offering great value for the price.  I'm genuinely impressed with the VIORI Hair Shampoo Bar. It's not only a fantastic product for my hair but also aligns with my goals to be more eco-conscious. I'll definitely repurchase and recommend it to anyone looking to make a switch to more sustainable hair care options.  Pros: - Eco-friendly packaging - Easy to use and lathers well - Leaves hair soft, shiny, and healthy-looking - Long-lasting  Cons: - None so far!  If you're on the fence about trying a shampoo bar, let the VIORI Hair Shampoo Bar be your first. It's a simple switch with impactful benefits for both your hair and the planet.  ---  This review is a fictional simulation and should be adapted or used as inspiration for your own unique review."

It was easy to lather up on my hand and I rubbed the shampoo bar in circular motions throughout my hair and then massaged the product in my hand. After washing, my hair felt clean and soft. I can’t wait to try more products in the future!"

For the conditioner bar specifically, I only used it on my ends, and not my scalp, despite the instructions. This is so my hair/oily scalp wouldn’t feel weighed down. I found it was relatively easy to use this to detangle my longer hair, and left it feeling soft. Also, love how cute the packaging is and how eco-friendly and affordable it is!"

No worrying about spilled liquid all over your clothes and no worrying about regulations that limit liquids in your carry on bag. The Viori shampoo lathers so much better than I expected! It gets sudsy and soapy as soon as I rub a little on the bar. However, it’s difficult to rinse off. My hair feels weighed down and I can’t seem to rinse off the product. Despite this, I would still use it, but maybe use less product. I do like the scent. It has the most beautiful spa-like scent, with notes of sandalwood."

I was honestly worried about it tangling my hair, but it didn't tangle at all! I have very thick, coarse hair and this worked great! I was able to wash my hair with this so easy and quickly! This left my hair and scalp so fresh, clean, and hydrated! I'm honestly beyond impressed at how well this worked! I'm so glad I decided to give it a try! This would be excellent for traveling as well! If you're like me and are unsure about bar shampoo, I highly recommend trying this one! I will absolutely continue using, it's a staple in my hair care routine now!"

It lathers up super foamy, cleans scalp and gets rid of build up, but also keeps hair feeling hydrated. I have super dry curly hair so I have to make sure my products aren’t stripping. This isn’t like that all! It leaves the hair quite soft. I’m interested to see where this goes as rice extract is said to be super good for hair. The only thing some may not like is it’s very perfumed. I don’t mind however."

It doesn't weigh your hair down and I like that my hair is still shiny. Totally worth checking out!"

At first I was like, whatever it smells good I'll keep trying, but it's just made my ends brittle with so much breakage. I've even cut off 4 inches to see if that would help, and still brittle. My hair has that squeaky sound when I'm washing it out too, and immediately soooo tangled. I've been using a really nice salon conditioner with it more often than usual bc it gets so tangled. I have longer hair, it's thin but I've got a lottttttt of hair, red head so I shed a lot as well. The Hidden Waterfall smells great! I wish there were more options for bar shampoo and conditioner!"

			"review_text": "For context I have fine, straight hair and an oily scalp, but I get my hair processed from a level 7 brunette to a level 9-10 blonde in certain areas, so I cannot speak to how this works on thick or curly hair.   That being said, I’ve almost finished a full size of this after finishing a mini a couple months ago. It leaves my hair soft, thoroughly cleansed, and not too greasy. I really like it and use it as my main shampoo during the week other than my clarifying treatment and toner :)   It is a little bit hard at first to get used to using it and getting a good lather. You have to have VERY wet hair, like saturated with water and not squeezed out at all, to get a decent lather, and it takes an extra minute or two to get the product dispersed through your hair. I recommend splitting the hair down the middle and working in 2-4 sections if you’re having trouble working it into different parts of the scalp, but that honestly makes it sound a lot more complicated than it is.   I could potentially see this being too drying for curly hair or too much for damaged hair because you do have to use quite a bit more friction on the hair to create a lather than you would with a traditional shampoo, but for me, doing a hair mask and a conditioner usually solves that.   Also I see some people complain about mold, I haven’t had that problem at all. You can’t just leave it in your shower, I usually take mine out when I’m done and leave it on a piece of parchment paper (or the bamboo holder you can buy from Viori) until it dries and then wrap it up a few hours later and stick it in a drawer.  Overall, I think it’s a great plastic-free option, suitable for oily hair, and salon results for way less cost. Give it a try!"
