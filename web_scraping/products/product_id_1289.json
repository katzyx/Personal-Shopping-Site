I use the kit every other day, both morning and night, after cleansing and toning, applying it with my fingers to my entire face and neck. It's now a staple in my skincare routine, keeping my skin healthy and glowing.also, don’t forget to wearing sunscreen it’s a most important part"

The one’s left are just acne scars - No issue when I use it in my skin care routine (I double cleanse, use the toner, then add centella moisturizer after)  1 star for 6% Mandelic Acid + 2% Lactic Acid Liquid Exfoliant: - I tried to use this for 2 days but stopped because my acne worsened - Smells like vinegar to me - I had additional acne and bumps after using it so I stopped using. This is based on my honest opinion and experience."

It changed everything for me to use the BHA Liquid and AHA Gel in my skincare routine. I went for the AHA Gel in the evening for a mild exfoliation and skin rejuvenation, and I utilized the BHA Liquid in the morning to clear blocked pores and regulate oil production.  They were a wonderful match for one another, giving the skin balance and glow."

I have been using 2% BHA liquid in my morning routine and 6% Mandela acid AHA in my evening routine. My skin didn’t feel any irritation. After over two weeks of use, I feel my pores look less pronounced than before. I did not notice any difference in my dark spots but overall complexion appears a little more clear and radiant. Over all I feel it is a good combination of exfoliants to maintain healthy skin . Texture is lightweight for both and go well with other skincare products that I apply on top."

I've been dealing with acne and uneven skin texture since I was a teenager and I still struggle with oily skin and clogged pores.  I've been using the Skin perfecting Exfoliation Experience kit for a couple of days and I can already see results. I started by alternating between the AHA and BHA exfoliant until my skin got used to it. Quickly, I was able to use both formulas daily, with the BHA in the morning and AHA before bedtime. The formula is very gentle and doesn't burn my skin.  Just like it says, the products unclogged my pores and visibly reduced the size of my pimples.

First and foremost, the clarity of my skin improved significantly. Any pesky blemishes or imperfections seemed to diminish, leaving behind a smoother and clearer complexion. I attribute this improvement to the unclogging action of the 2% BHA and the gentle resurfacing effect of the Mandelic Acid and Lactic Acid blend.  Moreover, the discoloration and uneven skin tone that I've struggled with in the past seemed to fade away gradually with consistent use of the kit. Areas of hyperpigmentation appeared less noticeable, and my skin looked more even-toned overall. This was particularly evident in areas where I've had stubborn dark spots or acne scars.  In terms of luminosity, my skin definitely experienced a boost in radiance. The combination of exfoliating acids in the kit worked wonders in revealing brighter and more luminous skin. I noticed that my complexion looked healthier and more vibrant, with a natural glow that I hadn't seen in a while.  What I love most about this kit is the ability to use both products together in my skincare routine. By alternating between the BHA and AHA or incorporating them both into my regimen, I could target multiple concerns simultaneously. This flexibility allowed me to tailor my routine to address specific skin issues while maximizing the benefits of each exfoliant.  Overall, my skin's health has improved noticeably since incorporating the Paula's Choice Exfoliation Experience Kit into my daily regimen. Not only does it look clearer, brighter, and more even-toned, but it also feels smoother and more balanced. I've noticed a reduction in breakouts and irritation, indicating that my skin's barrier function has strengthened over time. With continued use, I'm confident that my skin will only continue to thrive and look its best."

			"review_text": "After incorporating the Paula's Choice Exfoliation Experience Kit into my skincare routine, I noticed several remarkable changes in my skin's appearance and health. First and foremost, the clarity of my skin improved significantly. Any pesky blemishes or imperfections seemed to diminish, leaving behind a smoother and clearer complexion. I attribute this improvement to the unclogging action of the 2% BHA and the gentle resurfacing effect of the Mandelic Acid and Lactic Acid blend.  Moreover, the discoloration and uneven skin tone that I've struggled with in the past seemed to fade away gradually with consistent use of the kit. Areas of hyperpigmentation appeared less noticeable, and my skin looked more even-toned overall. This was particularly evident in areas where I've had stubborn dark spots or acne scars.  In terms of luminosity, my skin definitely experienced a boost in radiance. The combination of exfoliating acids in the kit worked wonders in revealing brighter and more luminous skin. I noticed that my complexion looked healthier and more vibrant, with a natural glow that I hadn't seen in a while.  What I love most about this kit is the ability to use both products together in my skincare routine. By alternating between the BHA and AHA or incorporating them both into my regimen, I could target multiple concerns simultaneously. This flexibility allowed me to tailor my routine to address specific skin issues while maximizing the benefits of each exfoliant.  Overall, my skin's health has improved noticeably since incorporating the Paula's Choice Exfoliation Experience Kit into my daily regimen. Not only does it look clearer, brighter, and more even-toned, but it also feels smoother and more balanced. I've noticed a reduction in breakouts and irritation, indicating that my skin's barrier function has strengthened over time. With continued use, I'm confident that my skin will only continue to thrive and look its best."
