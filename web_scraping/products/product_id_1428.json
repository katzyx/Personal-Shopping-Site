I have combo skin.. it’s been a week now since I stopped use and my skin is just starting to feel a bit more normal. Not totally there yet. I thought I was alone but my friend in a different town also got this the same day I did. She thought it was just her skin having a reaction until I told her about mine, she also had the same symptoms minus the itching. The packaging and feel of the bottles is nice. There was some leaking with one of mine in the box like the lid wasn’t on tight enough."

I’ve been using the lactic acid serum in the mornings and the retinol at night and after a week my skin feels and looks smoother. One mark recently left behind my a pimple also faded a bit.

The cleansing serum is really silky and enjoyable to use - it removes all of my makeup and cleansing balm. While I like how the formula feels, I do think the cleansing serum has triggered irritation around my eyes - it's the only product I've changed directly surrounding my eyes. While it doesn't seem to bother the rest of my face, sensitive skin beware. The lactic acid serum is gentle on my sensitive skin,  yet I've noticed a glow I didn't have before. Almost like velvet! The retinol is also gentle; I haven't experienced any flaking or redness, but I definitely feel like my skin looks more supple and smooth. 2/3 products I'd be interested in repurchasing - and that to me feels like a win. Complimentary from Shani Darden."

I hadn’t tried this brand before but I was excited to get this set because lactic acid and retinol are 2 of my must have skincare items. This set came with lactic acid, retinol, and a cleanser. The bottles for the retinol and acid are both glass and feel really luxe. I’ve used them both for the past 10 days and I do feel like my skin is smoother and brighter. It hasn’t been long enough to really notice the results of the retinol but so far so good. Both the serums are a thinner texture. The cleanser is nice, I don’t recommend it for removing eye makeup but it’s a good second step cleanser. I brought this set along with me on a trip and it really is the perfect travel routine for me."

I could’ve especially done without the citrus extracts. A simple tretinoin will also always outperform a retinol. This was gifted by Shani Darden."

The face wash feels effective and very cleansing, but didn’t dry out my skin or make it feel tight. The lactic acid serum has a lovely texture, thin (not watery) but it absorbs well into the skin without feeling tacky. Lastly, the retinol again has a lovely texture. My skin is used to acids and I’ve been more consistent with retinols so dryness was minimal. Overall, really impressed with the kit and interested in trying more products from the brand.

I have been using the lactic acid serum for 3 months and it has made the biggest difference in my skin. The cleanser is a surprising favorite. It literally is a serum like cleanser that does not strip the skin. I have tried a cleanser so light weight before.The retinol has been amazing so far as well and i had no irritation at all. I received this set complimentary from Shani Darden but all opinions are my own."

			"review_text": "I loved this set gifted by Shani Darden, it’s such a great deal! I love the idea of gifting this as well. I am in love with the cleansing serum , it’s so moisturizing and soothing on my sensitive skin. This was great for taking of my sunscreen and oil after a long day but wasn’t harsh so I could use it in the mornings as well. I loved how soft and plump my skin felt afterwards. I have very dry skin and loved that this retinol and exfoliating serum seems like it was made for me ! It didn’t give any usual retinol negatives like dryness or irritation. I love them both for really giving me smooth and supple skin. I feel like in only one use my skin looks more even and healthier. My skin looks bouncy and hydrated. I love it."

All three products in this routine are excellent for my needs! The serum cleanser is gentle but effective, and leaves my skin neither filmy nor dry. The acid serum is gorgeous for light resurfacing- it makes your pores less noticeable and gives the prettiest next day glow! And retinol should be in everyone’s night routine. This retinol serum is non irritating and so far seems to be working great!"
