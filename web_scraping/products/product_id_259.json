			"review_text": "I have been using this product for the past week and these are my observations: 1. Texture - not sticky, it’s smooth and glides on to the skin. 2. Radiance- my skin has appeared more radiant than it has ever been.  3. Scent - it’s not overpowering compared to other serums I have used.  However, I don’t see any visible reduction in wrinkles yet.  I like it so far. I might make this as a part of my routine skincare."
