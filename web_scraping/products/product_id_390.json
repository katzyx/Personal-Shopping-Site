Also as a medium-dark complected black woman, the white cast is evident. My partner asked if I had on sunscreen one day while wearing it. I may still use on my color bones and neck for the moisturization and glow but it‚Äôs not my favorite."

			"review_text": "Shout out to the bestie in the Q&A having a winge about the reviews!   Here‚Äôs my review, I received Dr Barbara Sturms glow cream approximately 12 days ago. After 12 days of morning use here‚Äôs my honest review. - lightweight yet creamy texture. Love how this melted into the skin - It does leave a glow, just like the name it does do what you expect. Gives a nice subtle glow. I‚Äôve enjoyed using this on my face and shoulders.  - Hydrating! With it being summer my skin has seen a thrashing of sun and sunscreen. This cream seems to be holding up on my face and shoulders and my skin isn‚Äôt feeling dried out by midday   This product is pricey, but has a shelf life of 12 months after opening. So for those looking for luxury and longevity this one will look after you. I love the instant luminosity this product gives. I don‚Äôt wear makeup daily so I love products that have skin enhancing benefits.   Could I see myself buying the glow lineup? Most definitely, I‚Äôve done some research into the brand, the mission and philosophies, and reviews that were organic. There‚Äôs a reason people love this brand and skincare lineup.   Much like any luxury skincare lineup, you‚Äôre paying for the process behind the product. I for one love this cream, it hasn‚Äôt broken me out, plays nice with my tretinoin, and I‚Äôve gotten more compliments on my skin in the last week than I have in the last year. Is that a testament to the cream? I‚Äôm going with yes."

I was breaking out like I hadn‚Äôt experienced since highschool and was overall really imbalanced. My combo skin was one side of the extreme to the other with my t zone like an oil slick and the rest was the sahara. Fast forward literally three days into using this as my daytime cream and my skin is balanced, smooth, and glowing. I‚Äôm amazed at how quickly this worked and cannot wait to see the long term results if the short term have been so good already. It‚Äôs lightweight, yet moisturizing. It provides such a glowy smooth canvas that‚Äôs perfect prior to makeup application (or on its own). The glow never looks greasy. My skin looks plump, healthy, and lit from within. If you want to invest in your skin, Dr. Barbara Sturm is worth the price in my opinion."

I ended up wearing this cream again and honestly could wear just it and feel so confident but I decided to try it layered with makeup on top and I am so happy with how it is wearing!

I can definitely tell a difference compared to more lower end options of moisturizers which don‚Äôt give the same glow. If you want that dewy look before putting on makeup or primer, I highly recommend the glow cream."

But if you like a mat look this isn‚Äôt for you. With the money? Sturm is always worth the money. I religiously used sturm products for 3 years, and then stopped. 3 kids life is expensive. And, I noticed the change in my skin as I look back at my old photos it‚Äôs prominent. So these products do work and they are made of clean ingredients which you can use while pregnant and nursing. So as long as sturm continues with the clean ingredients I will always use their product. You get what you pay for.   The 3 star is for packaging and the amount of product that get wasted on the process of opening the cream. The foil seal on these creams are like‚Ä¶ the bomb. You can never remove it!! I cut my hand open trying to remove the foil seal with a knife, the only way I can open the product.  My only request to Sturm team is please look into making your foil seals a bit more removable friendly? It is too hard to remove and in the process I end up wasting a whole lot of expensive product."
