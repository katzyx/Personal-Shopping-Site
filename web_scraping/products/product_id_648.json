Although I have always loved the idea of a black lipstick the ones I have used in the past did not stay on and the coverage was horrible. Thankfully this product has changed my mind.  It was so easy to apply. First I tested it on the back of my hand to see how it came out of the tube and then lined and filled my lips effortlessly.  The color saturated my lips and stayed consistent throughout the night. One tip is to move quickly when applying because once it's on, it's on! It a matte finish but it kept my lips feeling hydrated. At the end of the night I used a little coconut oil to remove it from my lips.  I love this formula. I am so happy I can now wear black lipstick that looks great all night!!"

I wouldn’t use it on my lips or face (like i had originally intended to) because of this. Maybe you can compensate for that with a really hydrating base before applying this product?   After using this product for two days, it broke me out on both of my cheeks and inflamed my eczema. Sorry gaga idk what u put in this but its not for me :("

			"review_buyer_description": "Brown eyes, black hair, Light skin tone, Combination skin",
			"review_text": "If you want a long lasting, matte, bold look, I definitely recommend this pigment paint!  After months of not touching this because it didn’t fit my needs at the time, I gave this pigment paint a second shot when I was driving from midnight to 6AM on a road trip to Yosemite. It lasted the whole night and through the next day and more! It did not budge one bit, stayed on even when I touched to get rid of an itch on my eye, and the whole red-eyed, exhausted dry eye and eye drop day after.  The black matte may not be for everybody’s everyday use, but as a gothic girlie that wears the under-eye makeup heavy, this is a godsend!  I LOVE how it doesn’t move or fall off at all like black eyeshadow, which I had been using as a setting powder for my eyeliner looks ‘til now.  This product will become my replacement for the black eyeshadow and black eyeliner I used to get that bold look on my under eyes because it does not budge at all!  If you’re more the artsy type that likes to manipulate intricate lines or designs, I highly recommend this as your BLACK eyeshadow, eyeliner, whichever.  The only complaint I have is that it’s not good on the waterline.  If this pigment paint could be used on waterlines as well as the face SAFELY, I would have no further complaints.  I highly recommend this pigment paint for experienced makeup users who know what design they’re going for, and have a steady hand. It might be a little difficult for beginners.  That said, its staying power is superior to all other products I’ve ever used! I think the key is, using MORE than you think is necessary for the pigment to stick all day :)"

			"review_text": "I have used this twice now as face paint to recreate Ziggy Stardust's lightening bolt for roller derby.  The Scarlette Matte is perfect; bold, highly pigmented, perfect coverage, and a very little goes a long way. Unfortunately the Sapphire Matte is not the same. The blue is not as bright or pigmented. It takes a lot more product to get the same results and the coverage is sketchy. I actually blend in a brighter blue eyeliner to get a nice bold look.  Both colors have extreme staying power. I use a setting spray to help, but I doubt it's necessary for casual use. I wear it for at least 12 hrs and sweat a lot. Never budges.  It doesn't irritate my skin at all, even with the arduous removal process (keep reading).  The best feature (staying power) is also its biggest flaw. This stuff takes WORK to get off. I've ended up with a combo of waterproof makeup remover, baby oil, rubbing alcohol, and then two washes with good ol' fashioned soap and water. I still have to scrub a bit more off with makeup remover."

			"review_text": "If you like little glitter particles to end up all over your face, then Gold Shimmer is for you! There are 2 things to consider here - the formulation and the color. The formulation is interesting - it's creamy as you apply it. But you have to let it set a while before you apply other shadows or you will rub it off. Takes a little longer to set than other cream products. After setting, though, it stays a bit tacky, so if you're applying other shadows, you need to dab or pat them on, not swipe. If you swipe, you end up loosening little glitter particles with your brush and they end up all over your eye area, brows, and even on your face. The formulation has a lot of staying power, though. It has a distinct smell. My dog even came over to see what I was applying to the back of my hand when I was testing it. (2) The gold shimmer color  is pretty, but it also contains glitter particles that end up migrating all over the place over time. Other colors might not have this issue."

I usually blend out eye primer with my fingers, this formula was more wet than the NARS one but it eventually dries down, I actually like that it gave me more time to blend out the primer than the NARS one. Another bonus, this is waterproof as heck, I tried just washing my hands with soap and water and couldn't get it out until I scratched it off my skin, I should have went in with my cleansing balm."

I have dry skin and these did not dry out my skin and I barely felt like I had makeup on. I received compliments all night and somehow became the put-together one in the group. On my eyes, I started by using my finger, one tiny drop for both lids and then buffed out with a brush. After it dried down I put a cream highlight just above the iris of my eyes. Easily build able and I have found I can apply it with just a finger if I don't want to bother with the brush. It makes a wonderful base for other eye products, or can be the whole look. I will be buying this again as well as getting more colors to add to the collection!"

There is a bit of a learning curve, you don't want to layer too much product on because it gets a strange texture and if you're using it on your entire lid you should let it set before closing your eye otherwise it'll separate.  But this held up through my entire concert and did not budge a bit!  When I bought the magenta shimmer it did not have the warning to not use it on the eyes so I did use it on the eyes for a look and there was a bit of staining left behind but it went away within a day.  These remove easily with an oil cleanser."

I used Elemis balm cleanser to remove followed by my normal face wash, like all eye pigments they leave a little stain behind on the skin.

I was really hoping to make it work as a blush since I work in health care I still wear masks and seeing half my face on my mask is a little bothersome. I put it on the first time it was a little too bright so I tried to blend it in with my fingers and it seemed to disappear all together. The next time I used a brush and same it was bright at first and disappeared. The third time I almost left it bright but it was a tiny bit too bright and I used a wet sponge to blend it but it all disappeared. I could see it working as a eyeshadow maybe that bright. But it was a little too bright for me as a blush. I really wished it worked for me but it just wasn’t working."

You can see in my photos that it dries a bit darker than when first applied(but also note the color of the paint tube itself, as there was a shift in natural light between photos). It's great to wear matte but I apply the Haus Labs lip oil over the paint when I want a little shine but you could use any gloss of your choice. I look forward to trying different shades!"

Hy-Power Pigment Pain is water resistant, won’t budge or smudge, which makes it great for use during the hot summer months when you are lounging at the pool or beach. Hy-Power Pigment Pain is hard to remove and you’ll need to use an oil cleanser or make up remover to remove it completely."

I have been using the Hy-Power Pigment Paint for Lips, Cheeks, and/or Face on my cheeks lately in the gorgeous shade Blush Matte. This is a peachy tone pigment paint with hints of soft pink. I am medium skin tone and I am loving how rich and creamy this formula is! You literally only need to apply a tiny drop because with this product a little truly goes a long way. It’s very creamy so that makes it easy to apply using your favorite beauty blender, make up brush, or even your fingers. I have attached some photos to show you exactly what this product looks like when applied to your cheeks as I did in the picture below. I love how this formula dries to a perfect matte finish. I also really like how this Hy-Power Pigment Paint does not wear off throughout the day and does not smudge in this humid summer weather. I do think the price is a little high as this product has a Net Wt. 0.25Oz. However, I do believe this product will last a while because you don’t need much in order to get a very rich amount applied to your face. So if you’re looking for a new versatile product that is rich and quality and shows really well on all skin tones this would be your perfect product. I am a huge fan of matte finish products but every now and then I do like a good shimmer so I do intend to try out the same product in different shimmer shades as well. I love that this cosmetics line is Vegan and Cruelty-Free and that it’s Lady GaGa’s line as I’m a huge fan. She is a beauty icon so I wouldn’t expect any less quality in her cosmetic brand coming from such an amazing woman. Thanks so much for this opportunity! #cleanhaus#hauslabsbyladygaga#influenster#voxbox"

The packaging it comes in appears to be recycled cardboard free of dye and that absolutely lends toward the aesthetic of clean beauty.  I am thrilled that Gaga’s rebrand is clean as I truly enjoy using products that are friendly to those that use them and the environment.  The tube that the pigment paint comes in is smooth and simple and the color matches the pigment paint shade which will be nice if you own multiple shades.  I applied some to the back of my hand and used my finger to apply to my eyelid and a brush to lightly blend the edge into some bronzer.  It does dry down quickly and I had to work fast on only one eye at a time.  The formula isn’t thick on the eyelid and has amazing gripping power.  It stayed in place through a long, hot and sweaty day without creasing or budging.  This is meaningful to me as I have oily skin and eyelids and I was amazed at its stamina!  The rose gold color is subtle on this one but the shimmer is beautiful.  I would imagine the matte shades are more intense in color. Overall, I enjoyed this product with its quick application.  The fast drying time did not bother me as I find that if it takes longer, it’s more of a hassle to keep your eye closed while it dries to limit creasing!  I would recommend this particular shade to anyone looking for an easy and subtle makeup look or to use as a shadow topper.  If you’re looking for more of a statement look, try some of the colorful matte shades!  I will definitely enjoying continuing use of this product especially when I need something this summer to stay put!!"

After application I gave it a reasonable amount of time to dry (about 15 minutes) and gently used a finger to dab at the eyeliner. Black pigment came off. This was repeatable. It also smudged after a few hours of wear and I needed to use a q-tip to clean up under my eyes. I tested with and without eye primer-- didn't make much difference."

However it dried on my hand within seconds and did not move. It is also waterproof (pro and con) because if you apply too much or want to correct it’s virtually impossible. However, it lasts. I will have to keep working with it to see if there’s a better way to use as a blush.   As far as a lippie, I am a dark/deep WOC and this shade is not a good shade for a lipstick (FOR ME). It is a peachy pink with more peach than pink. It’s like a matte stain so start light!!"

I don’t think I would like the formula on my face, but I could see it being used on the eyes very nicely as it’s thin and matte. It could be a nice base or used for finer details. The formula is something in between a liquid and a cream but leans more liquify. It’s thin and comfortable on the lips. It has good pigmentation, but I wouldn’t say it’s completely full coverage and would need to be build slightly if you want to reach full saturation."

This formula dries down very, very quickly so it’s best to blend it with something more hydrating or just finish your look a little quicker.

The short version- I give the product itself, 5/5 stars and the color I was sent 4/5 stars. I would buy it again, but it does concern me some of the colors specifically mention not being safe to use on eyes when most of the colors of the pigment paint are.   The long version- this pigment paint packs a punch. A TINY bit goes a long way and how you apply it will change the final finish. I squeezed the tube ever so slightly (just enough for product to start coming out) and used that little bit. For a more full coverage, I used my finger and blended it out using a dabbing motion (see the first picture for the outcome). I would use this for an eyeshadow look. For a more sheer coverage, after applying a moisturizer and my foundation, I pressed my finger into the same little small amount of pigment paint, dabbed three dots on each cheek, and blended it out with a wet beauty sponge (see second photo). While this color isn’t my go to blush color, I felt this created a nice blush finish and I would consider this color in the future. I have decently dry skin. I ate dinner with the pigment paint applied this way and didn’t feel like it was overly drying or cakey. In fact, I felt like it blended nicely and I didn’t really notice it after blending it. I’ll definitely be buying other colors to try after it becomes available for everyone."

One small dot was more than enough for face, chest, where ever you want a really beautiful tropical blush glow. And it dries really quickly so my hand has a few rosy dots till I decide to remove them… sometime later. I placed my glow under highlighter and bronzer for a more natural flushed glow.

It dries down to a lightweight glue like consistency... but it is still thin enough to apply as an eyeshadow."

			"review_text": "I received this product from Influenster in exchange for my honest review. This is a powerhouse of pigment! A little of it goes a really long way. Once you start blending, don’t stop until you’re done because once it’s dry, it’s set and that’s it. I love that it doesn’t budge at all once it’s set. I tried it on my cheeks, and although I loved the texture, the tint, and the blend-ability, I wasn’t a huge fan of the shimmer on my face. But I think it’s just the shade I used; the matte shades would probably be better for my cheeks. I tried it on my lids, and I loved everything about it. I wore it alone on my eyes and blended with my finger. Once it was set, nothing settled into the creases and the shimmer was gorgeous. I tapped a little on to my lips and it works really well on top of a lip balm. It’s very long lasting; I tested on my hand and it took some effort to wash off with soap and water. I love the versatility and can’t wait to try more shades!"

			"review_text": "This Liquid Blush is so interesting. Comes out as a cream texture, then dries completely matte. It has more of a skin-like finish so better for oily skin or people that don't like so much of a dewy glow. I'm extremely impressed by the transfer-proof quality. I keep aggressively running my hands over and it won't budge! It is a little small but you won't need a lot, since it dries down fast just make sure to blend it quickly because it will not budge after it dries!"
