The only bad thing I can say about this blush is that the mini is very messy it gets all over the stopper and lid but it's not too bad"

My only beef ((and reason for just 3 stars) is the product gums up and builds up around the screw top opening EVERY time. 🫠 If you don’t wipe it off once the lid is back on, it will smear all over everything in your makeup bag. A design flaw I hope they can address and fix in the future 🤞🏻"
