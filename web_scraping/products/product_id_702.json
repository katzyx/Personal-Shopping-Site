			"review_text": "This smells great and a nice changed for the Boss Bottled line. This uses fig to give a dry, earthy, very interesring scent. In the dry down, I get a softer mix of leather, woods, fig, and powdery iris. It's very wearable and perfect for colder weather or rainy days or any evening occasion. This has nothing in common with any other Boss Bottled release as this drops the apple feel for more woody type vibe. The projection is decent, it's not a room filler but that makes it all the more wearable during the day. The longevity is awesome lasting a good 8 hours even if it's not projecting that hard but sitting within a nice scent bubble. I highly recommend getting your nose on this one."
