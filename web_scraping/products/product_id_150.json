Be sure to use cool blast - it will set your curls and makes it easier to change out tools. Also, hold tools at the base of the tool when adding or removing. The tightness of the curl doesn't hold for long but the volume is AMAZING and my hair looks good all day. If you're looking for precision curls that last all day, get a different tool. If you want an amazing, voluminous, salon style blow out tool, I highly recommend this!"

			"review_text": "I normally don’t write reviews, but I returned this product, and want to give my thoughts if it’s helpful for others   Backstory: was interested in the Dyson, then Shark, but couldn’t justify the cost. I have T3’s curlers and DryBars dry brush, so I had the individual tools.   Sephora Rouge Sale, I saw the Bondi with great stars, could buy it for $150, so I immediately pulled the trigger.   Initially: I loved it. I could blow dry my hair in 5 minutes and do a quick blow out in 10-15 minutes.  Additional thoughts: The appliance itself felt cheap compared to my T3, but I had no frame of reference for airstylers.  I hated how hot the styler attachments got, I had to use my hot pad to remove them/put new ones on (like the different direction barrels).  The curls do not last, but I really liked the circular brush/blow out style I was getting, so was still happy. The air suction isn’t strong, whatsoever. I don’t know the numerics of my hair type, but I am a natural blonde, very fine hair, slightly wavy, but it is very thick and quite long (natural waist maybe?). The air suction on the curlers would barely pick up any of my hair, I truly can’t imagine how it would work on coarser hair. I’m talking 1/3-1/2 of the hair I’d normally section/curl with my iron. Then, I was using the circular brush, and the whole attachment snapped off. In investigating, the plastic of the the connection would get so hot that it would bend the plastic — making the attachments unusable.   I returned it, and generally was super bummed but glad it broke within the month, so I could get my money back. Amazon Black Friday, I spent the $70 more to get the Shark on sale. Immediately, the appliance is more sturdy, substantial and feels quality. Dried my roots in 1 minute, root to tip in 4 min, and curled in an additional 9 min. No troubles with the heat of attachments, air suction/strength, etc. I would highly recommend saving until the Shark is in budget!"

My hair routine has been cut by 3/4 of the time. I was using Lange Airflow Straightener and curler before. This replaces that, plus my hairdryer. The curls last forever!!! It was easy to use with the Left and Right barrels.  I LOVE being able to dry my hair with this!!! I've never used Dyson or Shark, so I can't compare, but for the price, my hair is looking and feeling amazing!!! Time will tell if it lasts...crossing my fingers that it does. For now, it gets 5 stars."

It’s also lightweight, making it easy to hold through long sessions, and I loved how the concentrator attachment helped reduce shrinkage. Her hair felt smoother and looked shinier.

Unfortunately, after 4 months of light use (no dropping it, not travelling, using it 2 a week) in interior connector has broken.  As a result, the attachments are no longer locking and are wobbly to use.  Having read some of the recent reviews, it looks like this is a common issue.    In terms of functionality, I was really happy with it.  It dried my hair quickly and was great for a low key blowout.  It clearly, however, is not built to last.  I contacted Sephora and as it is outside the 60 return window, there is nothing they can do.  Strongly don't recommend.  You are better off paying more once than having to buy twice."

I only used the 2 brush attachments. I let my hair dry in a microfiber towel for about 15 minutes before using this styler, and then that part took me about 30 minutes. My hair still has its curl, but is smoother. There are 3 fan speeds and really 4 heat settings - no lights on that side is cool, then 3 settings with heat. I used the medium fan and medium heat to dry, then the cool setting. The cool setting is actually cool. I've used other dryers and stylers where cool is just room temperature. This setting is actually refreshing, which is amazing because doing my hair makes me sweat.   Pros: excellent cool shot, lightweight, longer handle, carry bag with hook!

Another thing I love about the BondiBoost Airstyler is the versatility. It comes with a round brush and blow-dryer attachment. The attachments are easy to swap, and they glide through my hair without tugging. And it's lightweight and easy to pack in the travel back.

It’s a little bit of a learning curve if you have never used something like this. Once you get the hang of it, the attachments kind of do a lot of the work for you which is awesome. (Definitely make sure you section off your hair to save time and sanity.)  First go, it only took me an hour from out of the shower to the photo attached, but once I get the full swing of things, I think I will be able to style my hair in thirty minutes with this! (Important to note for reference: My hair is stick straight and flat normally; individual hairs are thin, but there’s a lot of them.) Only negative so far is I wish the 32mm attachment was a little smaller. That would make it perfect for bangs and getting closer to the root. The Rough Dry attachment is going to replace the need for my regular hairdryer. It dried my hair so fast and with no frizzies. The only attachment I didn’t use was the Dry + Smooth one, as I didn’t really have a need for it.   If you are in the market for something like this, I think the Everlast Styler is for sure worth checking out, especially comparing its price point to others I have seen. I can’t wait to incorporate this into my hair routine!"

			"review_text": "I bought this for my birthday. Be nice to yourself once in a while. I'm 64 now. I have long hair. Never dyed. I do have some natural wave to it. As of this review all ratings are 5 stars. This looked too good to be true. It is. But i plowed ahead and smothered any doubts and purchased it.  Nice little carrying case it comes in. Even extra compartments for a couple of thin or small items. You could actually use this case for makeup when traveling. It would work great for that too.  The noise level was great.  The round brush is not for my long hair. It does not replace a round brush and blow dryer. It creates fly-aways and it is nowhere near as good as a regular round brush and blow dryer.  The bigger blow out brush. Eeek. It creates even more fly-away hair. I found a lack of control and ease of use I get using this compared to a round brush and blow dryer. And the end results of this brush took way too long and unhappy results.  The angled? dryer. Wow I did not like this. Stand in front of a floor fan on high speed and you get the same result. No control. It does not replace my regular blow dryer.  The  smooth dryer concentrator I really did not like it. It's cumbersome to maneuver. It causes way too much work to get a result. Caused me major flyaways. I had to hold it in such a way that I asked myself why did I buy this?  The air-wraps. They do wrap the hair. The air coming out made my hair fly around a bit until it wraps. The curl looks great at first. But was almost gone before I finished. Strange.  I'm not going to return it. I'll keep working with it before I give it away to a sister. But first I'm going to cut off about of foot or more of hair and see what the wraps do then.  After each use they get hot! Be careful when changing.  I'm sure this works for some people. It does not work for me. I have to put in far too much effort to get a blow out with a sleek mane I achieve with a round brush and blow dryer. I never achieved it with this. Good concept though!"

			"review_text": "The design is sleek and ergonomic, making it easy to handle and maneuver while styling.The ceramic barrel not only speeds up drying time but also distributes heat evenly, preventing any hot spots that could damage hair. The bristles are gentle yet effective, detangling my hair effortlessly as I blow-dry.  I used to spend ages with a separate brush and blow dryer, but now I can achieve salon-worthy results in half the time. Whether I'm going for smooth and sleek or voluminous styles, the Everlast Airstyler delivers every time.  Another thing I love is the versatility of this tool. It's not just a blow dryer brush – I can also use it to straighten or curl my hair, making it perfect for creating different looks without needing multiple styling tools cluttering up my bathroom.  Overall, the BondiBoost Everlast Airstyler Ceramic Blow Dryer Brush has exceeded my expectations in every way. It's efficient, versatile, and leaves my hair looking and feeling amazing. I can't recommend it enough!"

When I found the Bondi Boost Everlast Airstyler my dreams came true! ✨️ I have naturally pin straight hair so getting my hair to hold a curl is close to impossible, but with the Everlast Airstyler it was no problem! I love that I can use it on wet or dry hair and the results are consistently amazing. The fact that it comes with so many components to achieve multiple hair styles and is less than $200 is my favorite part. The heat vs. cold options work great. The only thing I wish they had was a heat protective glove included because the tools do get pretty hot when changing them out from styling the left and right side. Overall, really amazing product!"

My hair was damaged from heating tools I used to use, but I have noticed a substantial difference.  I use the  Angled Dryer to do my initial dry. Then I use the Smoothing Concentrator to dry and smooth before styling with the 2.25 Ceramic Volumizing Round Brush I finish with the cool air to set my look. The Everlast Airstyler has helped to reduce damage and leaves my hair soft and smooth."

I also love the travel bag that it comes with! The heat is never too intense either so I don’t feel like I’m damaging my hair. The blowout is honesty even better after a night of sleeping on it. Highly recommend for a quick and easy blowout."
