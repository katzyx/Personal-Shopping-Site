After using this product and shaving, I no longer have these issues. It is recommended to use the product twice weekly, so i use it before shaving, and a day or so after and it gives me the smoothest, cleanest shave. Additionally, because of the AHA, my skin is so soft. I have only used the tree hut scrub before this, and I find that the grain is way too big to get the results I get with the First aid beauty one. I think the fine grain really helps to get in the skin without too much trauma and irritation to the skin. Highly highly recommend! Never been so satisfied with a product before :)"

Then I got a sample from Sephora of this - I opened up a completely different package of this and the awful smell was still there. I’m not normally sensitive to smell but this makes me want to vomit. I did try using the product, and I like it as a body scrub - the texture is quite nice. But I would never buy this again and am turned off by the brand after using this. To be honest, I was shocked there are not more reviews about how terrible this smells. For the cost, I’m quite surprised the company can’t put a couple drops of a floral or citrusy fragrance in this, it would completely change my mind about the product. Until then, be warned."

Some body scrubs just don't have enough scrubbing power to get the job done, but this is on another level! I use this once a week for a nice full-body exfoliation. This is a pretty abrasive scrub, so I recommend using it gently. The only thing I would change about it is the scent. FAB caters to sensitive skin (which is amazing!), but I want them to come out with a fun scented scrub to go along with this unscented version. Either way, this is a must-have in my shower routine!"

I find that many exfoliating beads tend to be very sharp or they aren't strong enough/disappear within seconds which leaves you wondering if its truly doing its job. This body scrub remains on the skin as you scrub which truly gives you the full effect of the product.

She said use this and any kind of cream with extra salicylic acid (she recommended Cerave Rough and Bumpy).  I have skin that's a little more on the drier side and I live in New England with long, dry winters (8 months of heating our homes ><). I have to be careful with exfoliating and moisturizing routines that can make my dry skin worse for that reason.  All that being said, this product works REALLY well for me at controlling the keratosis pilaris I have on my arms and back of my legs. And it does so without drying my skin out or causing any other side effects. I generally use this every other day. Sometimes with the Cerave and sometimes without (if I forget or am running late). If I skip a few uses of this scrub, I can tell the difference. So, it's important that you keep consistency to see the consistent results. But I feel this is totally worth the money!    Also, I enjoy that a little bit of product goes a long way. I use about a nickel sized amount for my upper arms and the back of my legs. So if you (like me) are thinking it's too pricey, please know that it lasts a long time and doesn't take a lot of product to be super effective!"

			"review_text": "I am compelled to share my underwhelming experience with First Aid Beauty's KP Bump Eraser Body Scrub with 10% AHA, a product that has fallen short of its promises and has raised concerns about the brand's quality and customer service. Additionally, I'd like to highlight the issue of missing samples, further adding to my disappointment.  Having heard positive feedback about First Aid Beauty, I had high hopes for their KP Bump Eraser Body Scrub. Unfortunately, my experience has left me far from impressed.  The scrub itself failed to live up to its claims of effectively exfoliating and improving the appearance of keratosis pilaris (KP) and rough skin. Despite using the product consistently, I noticed minimal improvement in the texture of my skin. The scrub's effectiveness was questionable at best, and its gritty texture felt harsh and abrasive on my skin.  Additionally, the fragrance of the scrub was overpowering and unpleasant, making the overall application experience far from enjoyable. This lack of attention to sensory details further diminished my confidence in the product's quality.  Equally concerning was the issue of missing samples. As a customer, I had expected to receive the promised samples along with my purchase. However, upon receiving my order, I was disappointed to find that the samples were nowhere to be found. This oversight is particularly disappointing considering that samples are often an incentive for customers to try additional products from the brand.  Furthermore, when I reached out to First Aid Beauty's customer service to address both the ineffectiveness of the product and the missing samples, I received a lackluster response that did not adequately address my concerns. This dismissive approach to customer inquiries further raises questions about the brand's commitment to customer satisfaction.  In summary, my experience with First Aid Beauty's KP Bump Eraser Body Scrub with 10% AHA has been underwhelming at best. Subpar effectiveness, an ov"

I have had body scrubs that are much better for my skin than this stuff (and it was cheaper than the original price of this product too).
