			"review_text": "Got this set because I wanted the moisturizer (which is normally $52 on its own), so the set was a great deal. The oil it comes with however smells exactly like fish oil. It says it is vegan but I have no idea how it could so closely mimic the smell of fish without having some sort of fish product in there. As an oil, I guess it is okay, but I cannot stress enough if you are going on a date or going to have anyone near your face do not put that oil on or you will smell like fish. The smell lasts a few days too and it will make your pillowcases smell like fish too."

			"review_text": "I am 47 years old, I had already been using the moisturizer which I love.  The moisturizer works well at night and with my makeup in the morning.  The oil moisturizes very good as well.  My skin is noticeably softer. In the evenings, I can apply the oil to all over my face, but in the morning I only applied to my cheeks because otherwise my make up creases."
