Most brands don't have a shade match for me or they oxidize so bad I can't wear it. Nars has my shade but all formulas break me out. I've always found with my natural skin tone that a lot of foundations dry down and look chalky if they don't oxidize. I have combo skin, on the oilier side in my t zone area, acne prone and sensitive too. This does not break me out or bother my skin. I think because of the glow it doesn't appear chalky in my shade and I love that but its also not too glowy. It gives medium coverage like it claims to. I apply with a sponge after applying the IT cosmetics concealer. This does seperate some around my nose by the end of the day, but I can tap around and blend it back out. I have that issue with all foundations. I do think this is way to pricey, it should be more in the $30 range at most- but a little also goes a long way for me. A pump covers my entire face. If you want more coverage, I recommend the original formula or to use the concealer in spot areas before applying this."

I used it with milk dewy primer and then set it with the milk dewy setting spray applied with a sponge. Although I’m not the hugest fan of that setting spray hence the sponge application I got on the subway in July, had brunch, was out all day and was fine. Application is key. I love this foundation."

Personally, I wouldn't call this a foundation whatsoever. Tinted moisturizer 100% and boy oh boy, they do mean MOISTURIZER. A shame, I was hoping so badly to find something lightweight but buildable. With this texas heat, I do not need the extra slippery feeling on my face. The humidity does that all on its own just fine...not to mention, I swear this stuff would sting from time to time!"

I really wanted a “3 in 1” product (moisturizer, foundation, and sunscreen) and I feel like this checks all those boxes adequately. I especially love that the product does not crease at all during the day, no matter how much you scrunch your face and sweat. If you’re looking for something more matte or more full coverage, it might not be for you, as I feel like the coverage is more similar to a skin tint than an actual foundation. Also, it is super hydrating but doesn’t leave my face feeling oily- a welcomed feature for my combination skin."

I appreciate that it helps even out my skin tone while also basically saving me the step of additional putting on sunscreen. As well I don't like using heavy coverage foundation so I like that I can still see my own natural skin, just improved. My main negative is that it can feel a little greasy on my face, and it comes off easy. Also, the colour match was unexpected. I tried this out at the store and it's weird that the rosy undertone was the best match. I have a warm/neutral undertone, but those didn't match right. If you are looking for a skin tint with good SPF and you are choosing between the Ilia one and the IT cosmetics one what pushed me to buy this one instead is that it doesn't have that wet dog smell like the Ilia skin tint does."

I am obsessed and so so happy to finally have a foundation again. Now I will say, the IT CC cream in Light is a darker version of Y235, but the undertones are a perfect match.

It is not sticky and doesn’t settle into fine lines but instead makes you look like a blurred, glowing goddess. Wore nicely all day without patching or turning into an oil slick. I even added a touch more after an 8 hour day so I could go to dinner and it melted in beautifully and layered well. 11/10"

			"review_text": "Immediately yes. Here are the pros: this is true to its description. It is lightweight, provides a glowy finish, pairs well with most moisturizers (avoid using with FAB ultra repair cream), and helps even out my skin tone. I do have very red cheeks, and I find this calms down the redness without creating a monochromatic mask. Additionally, I find the formula very moisturizing, which is perfect for winter. The best part is that this product is designed for lazy people such as myself. I apply it with my fingers, I don't have to worry about forgetting SPF, it's not high coverage enough to look patchy, and it stays dewey throughout the day. It's an essential part of my five-minute makeup, but can also be combined with cream or powder contour, blush, highlight without pilling or lifting.   My only notes are that this is best used with a setting spray, as the moisturizing formula is easy to remove by wiping your face with a tissue. It just helps it stay for the entire day. The second thing: I find this does make me break out more than usual, so I do like to give my skin a break for a few days and stick to concealer. This might be because sunscreens typically do cause breakouts for me, but the product is so convenient and pretty I use it anyway. I would prefer to have a breakout than forget sunscreen, which I inevitably do."

This shade is perfect for me. I'm a natural redhead with ridiculously white skin. You can see everything - redness, blue eye circles, and even some veins! I like using foundation to even out my skin tone and add some life to my face. The other foundation I use from IT doesn't come in a white enough shade and it's a little yellow-y in fact. Even though this new shade (fair-porcelain) is a good match, the foundation itself has rather faint coverage. It says medium coverage, but I'd actually rate this as light coverage personally (sort of like a tinted moisturizer). I also didn't really like it's blend-ability. I found this one to be a bit more streaky and residue-y than my other foundation. It was a good try and not a terrible product, but I think I'll return it and go back to my other foundation."

I actually love using my hands with this product and it blends in wonderfully. It is NOT cakey or overwhelming. It does NOT crease under my eyes and it lasts all day. This is my new GO TO foundation.

I've been wanting to try this for a while now, and I desperately wish I did sooner! I first tried nars spf tinted moisturizer. did not like it! I do think it's nice for under make up for a full face if you have an all day/night thing. but unfortunately it was very drying. this CC+ cream has the great benefits of nars without being drying! goes on smoothly and blends in soooo well. and such a nice natural glow! it's so pretty. I have light brown skin (indian girl) so the neutral medium is perfect. I finally understand why it's always sold out. totally worth it! I love that it's not one of those super small and skinny bottles like other brands. while it's not a big value size, it's still a decent size for the amount you pay. this is perfect for those natural makeup look days, it's a nice primer that doesn't make your skin crazy dry. it's not super amazing coverage, but it does provide some coverage without being cakey/flakey like other products. I have dry skin so it's hard to find a product that doesn't dry it out even more. super impressed and will be buying these forever!"

I will say that it is a COMPLETE 100% colour match to my skin tone (whereas Fair Light was a little dark for my winter skin), the coverage and longevity just aren’t there. As you can see in the unedited, unfiltered photos more of my flaws and freckles are poking through. This is even more prominent after 1-2 hours of wear. I was expecting light coverage so I was okay will slapping on some concealer to hide any tough spots. Initially the finish was quite beautiful, however it really starts to fade on the skin after only an hour or two of wear. I was much more impressed with the original formula. I might return this for a lighter shade in the original.   If you are okay with having more of a tinted moisturizer that you will need to reapply throughout the day, this isn’t too bad. However it does not hold a candle to the coverage and longevity of the original formula. Personally I will stick with that."

CC part of this is the worse part, it changes on my skin, to more of a grey after 20 mins of application. Coverage non existent. If it had coverage the finish of the product is pretty, and skin looks hydrated, but the color messes it all up, and when I see the dark spots peaking thru under grey cast on the skin its very muddy and ugly.

			"review_text": "I am moving to a very hot desert climate this summer, and wanted a product that I can sheer out or build up depending on my skin’s needs. I have very dry, flaky skin, so it was important to find a dewy/glowy product as matte foundations just dont work for me. I wanted it to be glowy enough that I don’t have to layer dewy products underneath to minimize sliding and stickiness. Another import factor for me was staying powder and the ability for it to dry on the skin while still being glowy. This ticks every single box. It is GORGEOUS on my skin, not so dewy that it emphasizes texture or bumps but imparts a perfect glow. I can layer this depending on my coverage needs, and I don’t have to go in with a very sticky dewy primer. This also stays put on my skin with or without powder, and doesn’t feel heavy (an issue I run into with alot of glowy products). It blends in like a dream and plays well with my cream and powder products. I found the CC Cream from IT to be too heavy and caky on my skin, so I was reticent to try this, but went and picked it up after finishing my sample. My new staple summer base product for sure! Medium Tan works well for me, and I have a medium skin color with a warm olive undertone. If you’ve had issues with other glowy prodcuts being too heavy or slipping on your skin, give this one a try! I absolutely love it. So natural looking and gives a true glass skin effect without being greasy. I prep with Tatcha Dewy skin cream and set with a little bit of Charlotte Tilbury pressed powder."

			"review_text": "I tried the it Cosmetics CC+ Nude Glow skin tint in the shade light and, unfortunately, as you can from the swatch on my wrist, the shade seemed too dark to be classified as light. This seems more medium for me, so for those with light or fair skin, I would consider using a lighter shade than you would usually choose. Using this glow tint made me look substantially tanner but helped even out red spots in my complexion. As far as performance, the Nude Glow skin tint was very pigmented and evened out my complexion but gave little coverage, so I would state it was light coverage more than medium coverage. It did tone down some of my red spots and I appreciated that. Two things I really love about the product is that it is SPF 40 and that it has skincare benefits. Between a product with skin benefits and built in sun protection and a product without these, I am more apt to reach for product with these attributes. I do wish the sunscreen smell was a little more faint. If you are sensitive to smells, there is a sunscreen smell definitely present with this product, however it fades quickly. Overall, I do believe it provides that your skin but better look as it states on the package and I like that is evens out my complexion, provide sun protections, and skincare in skin tint."

My skin has been going through a dry spell, and the products I normally use have left my makeup looking patchy and flakey.

The coverage is sheer-medium depending on how you apply it, but I like that it is buildable and customizable to my needs that day. I like to use for a ‘my skin but better’ kind of look. Bonus points—the SPF 40 is amazing. I actually have a form of sun allergy and have been looking for the perfect SPF product to use on my face and this is it! It doesn’t break me out or leave me with an awful sunscreen smell. The only small con I have for the product is that it can feel kind of tacky on the skin if you don’t set it, but it hasn’t been an issue for me as I always use setting powder. I highly recommend the CC+ Nude Glow especially for the upcoming warmer months, I am now an It Cosmetics fan!"

It feels super light on the skin and gives just enough coverage for a natural look. The other CC creams can tend to be too thick, and I think this is a perfect balance. For my review, I was provided with the shade “light,” which is a bit too dark for my pale complexion. In the right shade, I think the IT Cosmetics CC Nude Glow Light is an ideal summer foundation. I would recommend it to friends looking for a multi-benefit skin tint that offers natural coverage."

The formula lightened up and even though my face was darker than needed to be, it wasn't as dark as the CC skin tint was right out of the bottle. I then started to use it with a heavy facial moisturizer and my light foundation that I already had on hand. After a few attempts, I think I actually made a good match for me. I'm happy to use the remainder of the product, but will always need to lighten it prior to application. I love the bottle and the formula in general. Very easy to apply and the coverage is just what I was looking for. Nothing too heavy or oily. I like the more natural look, but still have a few problem areas that I like to cover. This CC+ skin tint works very well for all of my skin needs. When ordering, I will make sure to get a lighter tint, as the Light one was more like a medium tint in my opinion. Cute container and overall was a joy to try."

It does color correct, I even put a side by side comparison of my green veins and scab on my wrist to show the difference on just how well it covers. I would say it's medium to almost full coverage. I also enjoy the fact that it's an spf foundation as here in Arizona, it's starting to get a little hotter and my tan is becoming more full circle. So sun protection is a must .. and it does leave a glow, finish also makes my skin look like skin & is very moisturizing. 4/5 rating and thank you Bzzagent for sending my way just in time for when I was searching for my next foundation ."

I thought the coverage was nice in that it matched my skin tone more or less and it felt like a sunscreen. However the only thing that bothered me about it was that it was heavy - might be because I am used to wearing very lightweight foundations and concealers. It also might be because there is a sunscreen component to it.   Looking back, I would probably get a lighter shade, but I would definitely use it again."

			"review_text": "I tried a sample once of the It Cosmetics CC Cream when it first came out and I loved the coverage and lightweight feel but felt I needed a bit more moisture and dew so when the It Cosmetics Illumination came out, I instantly bought it. I was severely disappointed with that one due to the excessive amount of glitter in the product and, since then, I've just kind of written off these CC Creams and chalked it up to them just not working for me. But THEN when I saw they came out with a CC Cream Nude Glow, I knew I had to try it. The product was already on my radar when I got offered a free sample in exchange for an honest review and I couldn't have been more stoked. I tested it the day it came in the mail and I am HOOKED. This is exactly what I wanted from the original CC Cream. It's got amazing coverage, but it isn't heavy at all and leaves my skin so hydrated, both while wearing it and afterward. It is super dewy and glowy and perfect for someone like me with skin more on the dry side. This is seriously my perfect product and it will be a new staple in my makeup bag. I'm so so SO happy they finally made a version that works better for dry and dull skin.   Also, I know this review was extremely long-winded haha, but I thought it was important to note that I've literally tried all of their versions of the CC Cream and why this one works for me, but the others didn't. Just in case you're in the same boat or are hesitant if another version didn't work for you. This is seriously AMAZINGGGGGGG."

This one has a bunch of shades to choose from, which is great compared to other products I've tried in the past where my brown skin tone was either too light or too dark and I would end up mixing in some foundation to get my color. With this product I have my color out of the tube.   It feels great going on and smells great also. This is a great, lightweight product. It evens out my light redness around my nose and definitely gives a glow. It feels more like moisturizer than foundation and doesn't look or feel caked on. I really like using a damp sponge to apply this. It has definitely become my new go-to product, but I would recommend setting it with powder."

Though it claims 40 SPF, I still wear sunscreen underneath because I can't cake on enough to get that claimed SPF coverage. When applying, I use about 3 pumps to cover my face in a single layer and the color medium is just slightly dark for me at the moment, but I'm sure as it gets warmer outside it will be just fine. There is a definite sheen once applied, which isn't necessarily my goal but it isn't overpowering. The color correcting is great and calms my rosy cheeks nicely. Likewise, the light to medium coverage smooths my skin decently. Since my skin is combination, I would probably avoid wearing this CC cream on very hot (sweaty) days as the formula is slightly heavy. Overall it is a decent CC cream, but I do think the price is a bit up there."

			"review_text": "I love how light and creamy this formula is. It isn't heavy like foundation. In fact, I couldn't really feel it on my face at all. It just felt like a second skin, which I loved because I live in a very hot and humid climate most of the year. The coverage was also pretty good. I did still feel like I needed a concealer on top for better under-eye coverage.   I have combination skin that is quite oily in my T-zone area. The first time I applied the CC cream, I tried it alone all day so I could see how it would respond on its own. I only added concealer under my eyes for better coverage of my dark circles. Within 90 minutes, my face was dewy all over. Within 3 hours, I had to pat down my face to minimize the excessive shine.   As a result, the next time I applied the CC cream, I set it with powder. It performed much better! I still had some dewiness that appeared around the 3-4 hour mark, but not as much as before.   So, if you have combination or oily skin, you definitely need to pair this with a powder (to minimize shine) and a setting spray (for full-day wear).  All in all, I really like this product and the lightness of the formula, especially during summer when full-face makeup in a 90-100+ humidity environment makes me cringe. This will definitely be my go-to for the warmer months, especially since it has SPF added."

My prom and when I was a bridesmaid in my friend's wedding. But love the ideas of BB and CC creams especially with SPF...   Top things right off the back1. My shade match was pretty awesome2.  It's lightweight and I LOVE the healthy skin glow I got without looking too dewy!3. It melted in soo smoothly Now to be fair I cannot speak about the longevity or staying power  of the product  because I have only  worn it for about 4 hours and wiped it off.Now I will say it did transfer throughout that time frame which I did not like.at all  But I also didn't set it with a spray or powder. Either way folks... it's a MUST TRY especially for the summer Raven "

In fact it's such a perfect shade match that it just looks like I have fantastic skin instead of like makeup.    It literally looks like an irl blurring filter for your face! To put it in perspective, I met my mom for brunch and she said wow, your skin looks amazing! Like a glowing goddess. What'd you do to it! It looks so natural and skin-like that this cc cream didn't register as makeup to her. I will most definitely be wearing this product all Spring, Summer, and Fall and stocking up on my summer shade too!  Highly recommend"

But after a round of the playground with the kids and getting hot it felt icky and I was ready to take it off. I'll try again with powder on top to set it and see. I love that's it and all in one thing and has spf 40 in it, because it's already getting hot here in Ga so time for that sunscreen again. So with a second try it is much better with the powder on top and no greasiness after a bike ride. I love it blends so perfect into my skin and matches my skin tone like it was made for me!"

This product is better for me than full coverage liquid foundation I wear, especially where I live because the weather is hot during the Summer and that can cause a problem if I'm outside and start to perspire and need to blot my face. This CC+ Nude Glow feels lighter, since it is a medium coverage tint and as a plus it also contains a serum and a SPF level 40 sunscreen.  When I applied it I used my finger, but there's also a tip on the box that says you can build the nude glow up by applying 1 to 2 pumps by using a brush.  The IT CC+ Nude Glow skin tint comes in a slim, lovely shimmering box. But the tint itself is in a tube that's 1.08 fl. oz., which is a good size, yet small enough to toss in your purse or bag to travel with. I feel confident carrying it in my purse without worrying about spills because the top stays put until you pull it up to remove it and you must push down on the pump to get it out the tube.    I like how fast, smooth and easy it was to apply and the way it gave my skin just enough color and coverage without looking heavy. It's also great for those times you just need a subtle change to your natural look and want to quickly get out the door, while also giving your skin protection from the sun's UVA/UVB rays! I would definitely keep this on hand and pass the news on to family and friends."

It's either the sunscreen or the tint being too light or not being the correct undertone, but it made me look ghostly so I didn't like that part. I'll have to experiment with some of the other shades to see if I can find my match, but as a whole, it felt very weightless and I loved the finish of it."

Let me first start by saying… it’s absolutely refreshing to find a skin tint like this which perfectly matches my shade (being a woman of color), moisturizes my skin, AND includes SPF 40 sunscreen. I’ve looked for something similar before to use during the hot summer months here in Las Vegas. The one other product I’ve tried made me look like a ghost! It was borderline embarrassing how quickly I wasted my money on that one.   And then, out of nowhere, I’m chosen to receive this gem from It Cosmetics - the CC+ Nude Glow in Neutral Rich. I love that it has green tea extract in it. It’s medium coverage which is ideal in the heat. It goes on so smoothly, applying it is a dream. The instructions say to reapply every 2 hours as needed but that wasn’t necessary. It lasted all afternoon this past weekend while at a birthday party/BBQ at the park in 85+ degree weather. It’s light but I still feel like my skin is being properly protected from the sun… which is awesome! Women of color can and do get sunburn, especially on our faces.  I’ll admit that the price point is a bit higher than I’d normally spend on such a product, however, I WILL gladly spend more money for better quality and longevity. I would most definitely recommend."

It just felt a bit too heavy and the light shade wasn't  quite right for my skin tone. I did love that it had SPF in it and when this glowy version arrived, I had to try it. The shade range is much better and the fair beige shade is a pretty good match for me. It goes on smoothly and seems to cover my red patches well enough, though it certainly isn't a full coverage foundation - and that's ok with me. It is very glowy and fresh, and maybe a tad too much for my taste, so I did set my t-zone with a touch of powder and the final effect was very nice. I love that it has SPF in it, yet it doesn't feel heavy at all. I think this will be my go-to foundation for summer!"

Feels very moisturizing Doesn’t really feel like wearing foundation 1-2 Swipes Full Coverage Unscented The pump is quite nice and feels more sanitary than a wand    The Nude Glow foundation is fantastic. It’s a great blend of sunblock, moisturizer, and foundation. I really enjoy how lightweight it’s on my skin. It’s also a pretty good moisturizer, and I noticed my skin was noticeably softer. As a sunblock and foundation hybrid, it does work well I didn’t need to reapply sunblock even while outdoors. Other foundations I wore in the same condition, ended up burning my skin. The Nude Glow looks fantastic on the skin, it has a very natural finish, without being too matte or dewy. My skin looks very smooth with this foundation. Nude Glow also has great coverage  I want to especially praise the coverage because I am not a daily foundation user. I typically like to use foundation as a concealer. As a concealer, I was really impressed by Nude Glow. My eyebags get dark, like a dark grey. With most concealers/foundations it takes a handful of swipes of product, With the Nude Glow, with two swipes, it’s gone, it looks exactly like the foundation. I just need to do some minimal blending into the skin, and it looks natural and smooth. As for the coverage, it definitely leans more into full coverage than other medium coverage foundations. I applied about five dots of foundation to my cheeks, forehead, nose, and chin.  The majority of my skin looked fully covered with one swipe, but areas with darker pigmentation such as my eyebags needed two swipes to be fully covered. Lastly, the longevity is fantastic, it holds well for around 12 hours, even as someone who occasionally touches their face throughout the day. It’s definitely one of the few foundations I would splurge on. If you’re looking for a foundation that you don’t need to reapply or fuss with it's a great choice!"

It could easily be built up to a medium finish if I used a second pump. While wearing for 10 hour days I only had to touch up on my nose with a little powder.

I love it.  Second: I also love the product. It's the perfect in-between a foundation and a tinted serum. It has just a little more coverage than a tinted serum but not enough to be called a foundation - applies well, easily buildable, and I really love that it contains SPF 40. I think given the consistency, it's also more forgiving on color match and I really like that about it. It stays on all day, doesn't rub off (even without a primer, but with a powder on top) and doesn't oxidize. I'd continue to buy this as an everyday layer, and I think a thin layer would do really well under a heavier foundation if I were ever to need it. I also love that it is nourishing and I love that it contains niacinamide, which I use on my skin frequently as a serum anyway!  One star deduction because I do feel like this isn't good for dry skin -- every single time I wear it (which is most days), I feel like it heavily accentuates any dry patches on my skin. I try to moisturize heavily that night but still something to be aware of - if you have dry skin, this may not be it for you."
