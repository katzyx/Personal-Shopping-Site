			"review_text": "I was SO excited to switch to smth healthier for my skin, and so I spent $200 on bare minerals less than 2 months ago. The blushes were not the right colors for me, so i returned them right away, not realizing that meant I wouldn't be allowed to return other items from the same order afterward. I used the powder foudation, mineral veil, bronzer, and foundation brush for a while. I use a chemical exfoliator 2x a week and have soft skin, but these products made me look CRUSTY, and the color was patchy. I decided to stay with it to see if I could find a way to make it work, but it never got better. TO MAKE MATTERS WORSE, after I washed the brush for the first time, it took so long to air dry that IT MOLDED. So that's just money in the garbage. All of it. Just awful, disgusting products."

However, in doing so, I end up wasting a ton of money and then I have a drawer filled with powders I hate because they aren't this product. This is my go-to; it can‚Äôt be beat. If you don't appreciate the illuminating bits of powder in this, their regular mineral veil is just as good. I have very fair skin and it is very sensitive to breakouts. This product is awesome. I wish their foundation powders had not changed colors and that their lightest foundation powder was consistently the color it was about ten years ago. Sadly, I've had to stop buying it because the powders never match the previously purchased product, and it's never the fair color it used to be. However, this product has remained consistently amazing. ‚ù§Ô∏è"

I do come across a bit ghostly, but once i brush off the excess powder, I fix that with a bit of Clinique Hydration Spray (the pink bottle). Easy Day. I love it. I still plan to try the Completely Sheer Version."

No matter what products I use everything slides right off if I'm out of a.c. for more than a few minutes. However, I used it over tinted moisturizer and it was light with a soft finish and it did well absorbing oil in my T zone while I was indoors.

It seamlessly blends into my skin, leaving behind an invisible veil that sets my makeup in place. It does have a bit of a sheen but I enjoy the summer glow look so it doesn‚Äôt bother me.   One of the standout features of this setting powder is its lightweight texture. It feels incredibly silky and smooth upon application, effortlessly gliding onto the skin. Unlike some powders that can feel heavy or suffocating, the Original Mineral Veil is feather-light, allowing my skin to breathe throughout the day."

It does seem to do a great job at keeping my makeup from melting on hotter days which is nice, and it helps to keep the sheen from my oily skin under control too. I've stuck it in my travel makeup case for when I'm out of town, but for me it's not an every day staple."

Then, I would use that same sponge with a little less powder and set my under eyes. Did I go back and try their recommended method? No! Why? Because, my goodness, my method worked SO well for my skin! I get quite oily on my nose throughout the day and the only powder I had found to combat that was discontinued a few months back. This does exactly what that powder did - mattifying me for the entire day without drying me out! It's perfection and I am so glad I have a replacement for my previous holy grail!"

			"review_text": "I recently had the pleasure of trying out the BareMinerals Mineral Veil, and let me tell you, it has completely transformed my makeup routine. As someone who is always on the lookout for a finishing powder that provides a flawless, airbrushed finish without feeling heavy or caked-on, this product exceeded my expectations in every way.  First and foremost, the texture of the Mineral Veil is incredible. It's incredibly lightweight and finely milled, which makes it effortless to apply. I love how it effortlessly glides onto my skin, leaving behind a silky-smooth finish. It doesn't accentuate any dry patches or settle into fine lines, which is a huge plus for those with mature or dry skin.  The finish it delivers is simply stunning. The Mineral Veil has a soft-focus effect that blurs imperfections and diffuses light, giving my complexion a radiant and airbrushed appearance. It truly lives up to its name as a veil for the skin, adding a touch of sheer coverage without altering the color or finish of my foundation.  Another standout feature is the impressive staying power of this powder. It helps to control shine and keeps my makeup looking fresh throughout the day. Even in hot and humid weather, I've noticed that my foundation stays in place, and I require fewer touch-ups. It's a game-changer for anyone struggling with oily skin or makeup that tends to fade quickly.  What sets the BareMinerals Mineral Veil apart from other finishing powders on the market is its formulation. It's made with minerals and skin-loving ingredients, which not only contribute to its lightweight feel but also offer skincare benefits. I appreciate that it is free from harsh chemicals, talc, and parabens, making it suitable for sensitive skin."

There's no blurring effect, I'm not sure how the other formulas blur, but this one for me emphasizes and exaggerates. There are little shimmer particles you can actually see on the face. It's just so shimmery. From far away or looks really great, but up close you can see every shimmer particle.  I will still find a purpose for it, but it'll just be in high points of the face (where highlighter will go). Definitely not for the undereyes!  I do have to say that I love the component it's in. I like that it twists closed, though if you get too much product out, it kind of just sits there awkwardly. So it can be a bit messy, but most powders are. I just don't love this, I sourish really recommend it unless you're into the look of shimmer all over the face."

Like a highlighter. Nothing, nothing like a setting powder. The illumination is anything but subtle. I swept it over my foundation gently and it instantly illuminated every pore and crease of my face.   This could maybe be a good highlighter if you focus it only in very specific areas, although even that may not work since it‚Äôs so powdery it will probably transfer across your face quickly.   Perhaps I will try the non illuminating one, the original, and give this another chance. But the Illuminating one is most certainly not a setting powder."

I used to kind of poo-poo BareMinerals but I was totally missing out!"

After reading a bunch of reviews on various websites from people complaining about the color/formula change, I sent a message to BM on Facebook referencing the reviews and asking them to confirm that their product was not, in fact, defective. They assured me the formula has not changed and that the product is as described, and that I'd receive a true sheer powder. So I ordered the Hydrating Mineral Veil, and was SHOCKED at what I received. This product is anything but sheer...it's a DEEP TAN/ORANGE COLOR. I tested the product on my face to be sure, and it looks absolutely ridiculous. I again messaged BM (and included a photo) and received some lame, canned response in return. I'm not sure what's going on with this product...but something is definitely not right. If you read the reviews, this issue has been a regular complaint from people since December. And for whatever reason, it's not being addressed by the company. Very bizarre and super disappointing."

I'm so oily in some spots I have to have a setting powder, but I have dry flaky patches that setting powder just clings to and makes worse. I recently purchased the hydrating version and... it's changed my makeup game forever. Hydrating setting powder seemed like a gimmick to me, but rest assured my friends with dry, flaky patches - this stuff will not cling to your dry patches and make them worse! It sets my makeup the way I need it to and keeps my oiliness at bay without making my dryness worse."

Have seen similar customer reviews on Sephora, Amazon and Bareminerals.com, etc.  I phoned both Sephora and Bare Minerals.   Neither company cared.  Both gave me canned responses and offered to exchange...which makes no sense.  (Unless they pull and replace current inventory, they will just be sending me more orange powder--ugh!)  They have no interest in fixing the issue itself...  Bottom line: this powder is hideous/ unusable.  I recommend buying something else."

I have super oily skin and when I buff this on in the morning, it gives me a super matte, almost drying finish -- to the point of visible flakes on my cheeks. While I don't mind my face looking a little dry, by mid-day my t-zone is COMPLETELY soaked through with oil. So this product doesn't do much in the way of oil control. As other reviewers have mentioned, it also has a reddish tint to it which can make you look orangey-tan. It'll do the job decently with some re-application throughout the day, but there are probably better options out there, particularly if you're on the oily side."
