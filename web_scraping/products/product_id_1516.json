			"review_text": "Although I enjoy all Sol de Janeiro items, I mainly purchase their body sprays or these Jet Set bags. Cheirosa '40 & '59 are my favorite scents and are worth testing out if you're new to the brand. Sol de Janeiro products are pretty pricey compared to affordable body care items (e.g., Bath & Body Works or drug store options), but this travel bag allows you to test out all the items before shelling out the cost for the full-sized items. All 3 products can be layered and help lengthen the body spray's longevity. Although I have sensitive skin, I haven't had an issue with the fragrance being too overpowering or irritating my skin.  I would love for Sol de Janeiro to come out with this Cheirosa '40 scent in an actual perfume vs just the body spray and really hope they don't ever discontinue this line. The scent is very fruity, but the warm vanilla notes is what makes it so good. I have a ton of perfumes to choose from every day but I have been picking up this body spray constantly instead. I receive the most compliments when I wear this scent and although it's a body spray, it has great projection. The plastic zip-up bag is a little small to be reused as a makeup bag; however, because it's clear, it can be used for TSA liquid items or as a emergency bag for your purse/car. The body cream that comes in this set is much larger than the deluxe rewards I have gotten and lasts a few weeks. The body wash and spray bottle are on the small side; however, they do last a few weeks also. Highly recommend picking this set up!"

I like body washes that foam up. The scent of all of these are AMAZING! I can‚Äôt explain how it smells but it smells so good! Zip up bag it amazing because you can use it for other things too. The cream it a nice texture and smells great. I see other people use it on their faces. I don‚Äôt but I would recommend not putting it on your face because it is scented and might cause redness. I‚Äôm not saying that it does but since it is scented, I would assume it would. I personally love everything it comes with. The cream lasts a long time. I hope this helps!

It's a perfect and playful balance! I am not one to buy full size products unless I am 100% sure I'll use them up, but I will definitely be coming back for full-size versions of this scent.

I have never tried or smelled any sol de janeiro scents before so this was exciting. well the day before it comes I go to the sephora store and I smelled all the testers. I have a kinda bad sense of smell and couldn't smell anything out of 40, 71, or 68. I could only smell 62 and Rio Radiance. I loved 62 and so did my mom but 40 was just so meh. My friend says it smelled like wine. I'm still going to use it and enjoy it but I just wish I had gotten 62 instead :/"
