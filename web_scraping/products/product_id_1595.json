			"review_text": "The Tata Harper Clarifying Cleanser stands out for its effectiveness and gentleness. This plant based formula targets blemishes with salicylic acid from willow bark while calming the skin with soothing aloe vera. It deeply cleanses, removing impurities and excess oil without stripping or drying.   The gel texture foams lightly, and the herbal scent creates a spa like experience that I really appreciate and absolutely love. Over time, it reduces redness and inflammation, making it ideal for hormonal breakouts or mild acne. This product is ideal for anyone looking for clean, luxurious skincare that provides results. The fact that’s it’s also eco friendly, is icing to the cake.   I truly enjoyed experiencing such a luxurious cleanser. I highly recommend this product!"

I hate to say this and love this as much as I do because it’s so Expensive!!! But if you have acne-prone or congested skin, the Clarifying Cleanser is a game-changer. It’s definitely worth every penny! It’s a lightweight gel that deeply cleans your skin without leaving it feeling dry or tight. With salicylic acid and natural botanicals, it tackles breakouts, blackheads, and redness like a pro. After using it regularly, my skin looked clearer and felt calmer. The cooling effect is super refreshing, especially in the morning—it really wakes you up! It’s strong enough to work on problem areas but still gentle enough to use every day."

It’s comes in this beautiful green glass bottle with pump that delivers the right amount needed to be used. The clarifying cleanser is out of this world. Not only it does smell amazing and gives you a nice fresh feeling into your skin, kind of wakes me up every morning. But, it’s also gratifying using after removing my make up. It does removes any impurities left behind and I feel my skin completely clean without leaving that feeling of harsh dry skin that other cleansers do. I’ve been using for more than a week and I can feel a great difference in my skin texture and glow. I love using after the exfoliator every night to make sure I remove any impurities I grab during the day. I totally recommended it."

			"review_text": "The Tata Harper Clarifying Cleanser is a standout product for anyone dealing with blemish-prone or congested skin. This gel-based cleanser features natural salicylic acid from wintergreen, which helps to exfoliate and unclog pores, while soothing botanicals like arnica and aloe vera calm redness and irritation. It’s designed to deeply cleanse without stripping the skin, and it delivers on that promise.  The refreshing cooling sensation during application feels invigorating, making it a pleasure to use both morning and night. After consistent use, I’ve noticed a visible reduction in breakouts, smoother skin texture, and a more balanced complexion. Unlike many clarifying cleansers, it leaves my skin feeling clean and hydrated rather than dry or tight.  While it’s a premium product with a higher price point, the results and the use of 100% natural ingredients make it a worthwhile investment for those looking to elevate their skincare routine. Ideal for anyone seeking an effective yet gentle solution to keep their skin clear and healthy."

			"review_text": "I am in my thirties and have combination skin with a very shiny T zone. I was excited to try this Clarifying cleanser by Tata Harper, because it claims to help oily and combination skin be healthier and matte. My first impression of the product was the it is an elegant cleanser with a glass bottle and an easy to use pump. The cleanser itself is green and has a very nice scent. Two pumps were enough for my face and neck, the cleanser has a watery consistency. I massaged it to dry skin and then added water to see it foam, and does it foam quite a lot! It makes the experience feel so satisfying because it makes it soft while it combats the oil and blemishes on the skin. My skin felt soft and looked so matte once I dried it but it did not feel tight. The scent is great! It is pricey but worth it."

I have extremely oily skin and also very red & flushy complexion, and this cleanser has really started to change that for me! The smell is so invigorating and smells like a fancy hotel! I love how Tata Harper’s products make me feel like I am transported to the spa. This is not overly drying or irritating so it’s a very easy way to add some AHA and BHA into your skincare routine! I alternate this cleanser with the regenerating cleanser from Tata Harper and also include the mask a few times per week. I have really noticed a difference in the clarity and light in my skin and I feel so much more confident in my skin! I was really starting to struggle with being unable to get my pores to look cleaner and smaller and this cleanser has helped so much!!"

			"review_text": "I have been using the Tata Harper Clarifying Cleanser for two weeks and I’m noticing a positive improvement in my skin’s texture and pigmentation.  You can see the diffusion of the hyperpigmentation at the top of my forehead in the before and after pics.   I have been doing a double-cleanse by starting with the Tata Harper Regenerating Exfoliating Cleanser and following up with the Tata Harper Clarifying Cleanser.  I have to say that they are a great duo - where the exfoliating cleanser is applied to a dry face and acts as a polish, this cleanser follows up with an application to damp skin and has a lasting, cooling/calming effect.   The scent of this cleanser is earthy, reminiscent of aloe vera and essential oils, which I don’t love, but am happy to report rinses away without lingering. My skin is left feeling smooth and looking soft and touchable.  This cleanser did not cause any sort of irritation, even on my eczema prone skin, and did not require any adjustment period for results.  While I may not purchase this as a stand alone cleanser, it was the perfect pairing with the exfoliating cleanser also by Tata Harper. A match made in skincare heaven!"

			"review_text": "I recently tried the Tata Harper Clarifying Pore & Oil Control Cleanser with BHA & AHA for Redness and was impressed! I'm a huge fan of foaming cleansers as the bubbles make me feel cleaner. This cleanser was super easy to use and did not irritate my skin at all. Thanks to calming botanical ingredients within the product, it helps reduce redness. On the days that I wake up to super red checks, I quickly use this cleanser in my morning routine and notice the redness fades fairly quickly. There is a slight lemony scent to this cleanser which isn't super strong but might be a bit much for those looking for a fragrance free option. I also use this cleanser and target my T zone as I'm super oily and prone to acne there. I've noticed this to cleanse but not strip my skin"

The lather is super rich and creamy and penetrates deep within my pores for an extra deep cleanse that removes all traces of dirt, makeup and pollution. The glycolic acid does a great job of ridding my face of dead skin giving my skin a smoother and brighter appearance. The salicylic acid is a great bonus as it helps to keep my acne at bay. My one critique of this product and the reason I took a star off, is for the smell. I can normally deal with any kind of scent but this smells like kitchen cleaner/polish on a nuclear level. Just a heads up for anyone that is sensitive to that kind of thing. Despite that, this cleanser is great to have in any skincare arsenal for a super deep cleanse, especially for us oily girls and guys!"

These ingredients together created a powerful yet gentle foaming Gel Cleanser that exfoliated my skin, gave me a healthy glow and definitely lighten my dark spots. I absolutely love the fragrance this product has, it's almost like a sweet jet floral scent that really enhance the experience when applying and rinsing off the product. The packaging itself is very luxurious I love seeing the Frosted green glass bottle on my bathroom shelf. It can sometimes be hard to find products they have clean ingredients, are cruelty free, have no fillers, and that work extremely well. Without a doubt one of my favorite cleansers."

Pros: deep cleansing, cleans pores deep down  Cons: no cons I have found  Overall, this cleanser is great for an everyday cleanser especially if you’re prone to blemishes. It helps to lessen the look of big pores. It reduces redness and helps to reduce the look of an oily face."

It doesn't dry out my skin and feels freshing both during the washing and afterwards; it feels hydrating without adding oil to my skin. It did sting my eyes a bit but I avoided getting too close to my eyes after the first use. It smells amazing and the bottle has a lux feeling that elevates my shower. The pump is also really nice but all of Tata Harpers products have really nice packaging. My skin didn't have that dry or tight feeling after toweling off and I wasn't rushing to put on moisturizer as soon as I was done with my shower. I also used this face wash at night a few times after my oil cleansing and it held up great with my nighttime products as well."

I use thick creams and balms on my face during the winter because I have dry skin. I love this cleanser because my skin felt and looked clean but didn’t feel dry to the touch. As always, I loved the Tata Harper signature scent it awakens my senses in the morning. The vibrant green gel consistency is so satisfying, and it lathers up nicely. The ingredients in this cleanser are natural and great for people with oily and acne-prone skin. Though I don’t have any of those problems, I benefited the most from the non-stripping foaming agents derived from the roots of vegetables since I have sensitive and dry skin. This is, overall, a good product to have in my stash when I need to get a good cleanse in, but I wouldn’t recommend it for everyday use if you have dry and dull skin."

My husband even said my skin has been looking much clearer and more vibrant- he wanted to know what I was using as his skin type is the same as mine as he was impressed with the results. Overall this product is excellent for acne prone skin and those with oily skin especially in the T zone area. It’s not harsh at all and I like to lather it for a long time to get all the ingredients penetrated into my skin and fully absorbed. The product lathers up nicely and you only need one pump so this bottle will go a long way. Overall I highly recommend it if you want a solid prodit that helps with reducing skin imperfections."

I'm normally not a huge fan of scented skincare products but this one hooked me with its gorgeous, fresh scent the first time I tried it. I will say it felt a bit odd at first since the instructions say to apply to dry skin but the way my skin felt so refreshed and clean afterward made me fall in love. I have definitely noticed a decrease in redness and a marked improvement in congestion. I know this sounds cliche because every company that makes cleansers makes this claim but it really DOES clean my skin of makeup and sunscreen and it does so without stripping my skin and destroying my skin barrier."

This works on my pores (which I always seem to need help with) and targets my acne spots. With regular use, I have noticed a difference in my complexion. My pores seem to be more cleaned out, my acne seems to have lessened, and my skin overall looks healthier. I really like this cleanser and will be recommending this one to my clients!

It does mattify your skin a little, so if you use a light moisturizer after, it will actually help control oil. The active ingredients for blemish control are awesome- which is why it works.  Prickly Pear Enzymes, Lactic Acid, Citric Acid, and Salicylic Acid- all from plant sources.  That's why Tata is the best.   It has a smooth texture, and foams a little when you wash with it- it is sulfate free.   I have been in the beauty industry for 21 years, and am a product junkie. In my opinion, blemish/oil control products are either stripping, or not effective.  This one really is comfortable and effective.   Bonus it looks beautiful next to my sink and smells good: ) White shirt before, black after."

But none of them have delivered for me the way Tata Harper’s Clarifying Pore & Oil Control Cleanser has. This foaming gel cleanser is derived from natural ingredients like cassava tapioca and Mojave yucca and is 100% sulfate free. It only takes two pumps of products for me to clean my entire face and some of the results can be seen instantly; namely the immediate mattifying effect and a noticeable difference in the redness of my face. And in the two weeks I’ve been using it I haven’t dealt with a single blemish. It has a pleasant, earthy smell and rinses away clean. But heads up, I recommend using it before brushing your teeth because no matter what I do the “taste” invades my mouth and has to be brushed away. Also worth noting that it can make your skin more sensitive to the sun so best practice is to use an SPF and protective clothing when going out."

I’ve used other products in the past, but either my impurities don’t disappear or they disappear albeit briefly.  However after using this product, I don’t think I can use any other product again.  The directions to use the cleanser was easy and straightforward.  I feel that when I apply the cleanser, I can feel that deep cleanliness on my face.  After I rinse my face and neck, that deep cleanliness feeling stays on for many hours at a time, and it feels great not to have dry skin.  I also like that the product is certified vegan and is cruelty free.  With me being an animal lover and a vegan-in-progress, I find this commendable and want to support Tata Harper as much as I can.  The smell is stronger than I would like it to be.  However, it is not stopping me from using the product.  After a while, you get used to it and you almost not notice it.  I recommend this product to anyone that wants a deep clean skin, and feel great about themselves."

So I’ve been using the cleanser at night and using the regenerating cleanser in the morning to try and get my skin from looking dull. During the winter months I tend to have more of a combination skin type so I try and use less products that are for oil control. This cleanser is so invigorating  on the skin. I was not expecting that feeling from a cleanser and it took me by surprise on the first use. It’s like a refreshing but almost minty feeling on the skin, I remove by eye makeup with another cleanser because I’m just scared quite truthfully to put it anywhere near my eyes.  The cleanser isn’t harsh on my skin. It leaves me with a face feeling so clean, soft and just fresh. I tested this cleanser out with makeup and no makeup.  With makeup I feel like it did a good job of doing oil control leaving me with fresh looking makeup for a while. Without makeup it kept my face oil free for almost 5 hours. I’m still surprised about that. It did leave my skin feeling a little too tight but again it could be because tend to not be as oily during the winter months.

The salicylic acid works wonders for clearing out my pores and keeping breakouts at bay, especially the pesky blackheads I get on my left cheek and around my mouth and chin area. I’ve noticed that my skin feels smoother, and my redness looks significantly calmer. It has a subtle minty herbal, yet woodsy scent that feels very natural and soothing. My skin tingled from the cooling sensation. One of the best things about this cleanser is that it doesn’t just treat blemishes; it also helps balance my oil production, leaving my skin looking fresher and more even, and feeling soft"

I feel like the ingredients are very calming like calendula and made my skin feel at peace. I would definitely use this product if you are looking for a reset. I have even used it as a spot treatment and the pimple went down. The redness was subdued. It is more of a traditional cleanser with needing to be applied on wet skin. I liked that. The product came across as tried and true. My skin did not feel stripped once I rinsed the cleanser off. It was gentle on my skin. The congestion in my skin went away by using the product for only a few days. I love the natural scent and aesthetically pleasing glass bottle that it comes in. It gives luxury skin care and is a delight to see in my bathroom."

So I used it only every other day, specially during the times that I was purging from the mask and this definitely worked! It calmed my skin and addressed the blemishes I had at that time. It might be dry to the skin after use but with proper after care it did not bother me. Made sure that my hydration regimen after cleansing was on point and it worked beautifully. It still has the natural a bit citrus scent that Tata harper products have but it is not as refreshing of a smell as the regenerating cleanser. I love that it is easy to spot the difference between cleansers even with just how the liquid looks like. Love the bottle the cleansers come in with as it is very beautiful to have at the bathroom counters. Knowing that a product they made best for oily skin worked well for me just made my admiration to the brand more and more. Looking forward to trying more from this brand and would spread the word about its effects on my skin."

It contains salicylic acid and glycolic acid which work together to help gently improve my skins texture. It has a light scent. The texture is very smooth and creamy. It applies easily on dry skin and foams up with water. It rinsed off without much effort. I like to use this daily in the evening as the first step to my skincare routine or after prepping my skin with micellar water.

The smell is from the botanical ingredients but I’m still not a huge fan of smelling essential oils in skincare because that’s still fragrance, and thus, can be a sensitivity trigger, for some. I do love seeing honey, high up, in the ingredients list; It’s calming, hydrating and antibacterial, a perfect ingredient in skincare for any skin type. Paired with other botanicals like willow bark (salicylic acid) wintergreen, this really helps inflammation due to the overproduction of bacteria harboring sebum in the skin. I can really see myself getting much more use out of it in the warmer months, with the clarifying moisturizer, because of that."

I then work it into the skin for at least a minute to make sure all these great ingredients have time to give me benefits.  I really like the smell of this cleanser, and it gives me a refreshing feeling when I wash it off. I have not had irritation or breakouts from this cleanser.

It features a vibrant green gel-like texture that feels luxurious and silky on the skin. When applied, it glides effortlessly, creating a smooth, slippery sensation that makes the cleansing experience enjoyable and indulgent.  The scent is herbal with a subtle hint of lemon citrus. While the herbal notes are more pronounced, they’re not overpowering, adding a natural and refreshing touch.  What truly sets this cleanser apart is its performance. You apply it directly to dry skin, and it works wonders—even on makeup. I tested it on a full face of makeup, including mascara, and it removed everything effortlessly. It’s just as effective as Tata Harper’s oil cleanser, which I also love, making it difficult to choose between the two. The cleanser removes every trace of dirt, makeup, and impurities, leaving my skin thoroughly cleansed without any dryness or tightness.  Beyond cleansing, this product enhances my skin’s natural glow. Each use leaves my complexion looking healthy, radiant, and refreshed. The high-quality formulation lives up to Tata Harper’s luxurious reputation, delivering a transformative experience with every use.  If you’re on the fence about adding this to your routine, I highly recommend it. Whether you’re a fan of gel cleansers or looking for an alternative to an oil cleanser, this product is a game-changer. It’s easily one of my favorite cleansers, and I’ll be reaching for it again and again."

Tata Harper uses natural ingredients with a focus on being gentle to even the most sensitive skin. I tried the Clarifying Cleanser and honestly, it couldn't have come at a better time! My skin is a little angry right now - or as the packaging says... troubled lol. I have been getting some uncharacteristic break outs and I think its a culmination of stress, working overtime and running out of exfoliant. This cleanser is green in color, a gel consistency and does have a strong scent - I would not call the scent a fragrance as I think it is just due to the ingredients - personally I like the smell it's kinda grassy/earthy. Ingredients at the top of the list that I love to see are honey, willow bark and arnica - these are all great at calming breakouts, controlling bacteria and healing! I would recommend this to anyone who is experiencing some breakouts or looking for a good clean feel without feeling too tight or stripped."

The prickly pear enzymes and juniper fruit feel like they’re doing good work balancing oil, and I didn’t experience any irritation. Plus, the chlorella adds a nourishing element to keep my skin calm.  After using it, my skin felt nice—smooth and matte—but I didn’t notice any dramatic changes right away in terms of blemishes or pore size. It’s similar to other cleansers I’ve used in that sense. However, I appreciate how it’s free of toxins and cruelty-free, which makes me feel good about using it daily.  While it didn’t deliver immediate, wow-worthy results for me, it’s still a solid cleanser for everyday use, especially if you’re looking for something natural and gentle. I’d give it 4 stars because it’s a good product, just not groundbreaking in terms of instant results."

The cleanser gives a good lather and leaves my face feeling cleansed and oil-free while not overly dried out. As I aged into my late 20s, and now in my mid-30s, I struggle with pores, texture, and blemishes more than I ever did as a teenager. This clarifying cleanser for problematic skin is working overtime to heal my skin, targeting blemish-causing impurities. I wish my before picture was right before starting use instead of a few days ahead, because I broke out like crazy -- BIG zits on both cheeks, my forehead, above my lips -- and this cleanser cleared me up almost entirely in a week in combination with the exfoliating cleanser. I'm adding it to my routine, no question. The bottle design evokes timeless class. I have no other product in my master bath, despite having other luxury brands, which is as aesthetically pleasing as the Tata Harper packaging. I like that the design is such that you can instantly see how much product is left with the see-through glass bottle. I am moving much more toward eco-friendly packaging and containers, and glass will always have more recyclability than plastic, another win for Tata Harper. Vegetarian, cruelty-free, and Forest Stewardship Council approved packaging. For all skin types. It does contain AHA, so be diligent with your sunscreen. Next-generation skincare, indeed."

It’s been really helpful in controlling the oil around my T-zone, especially when things get shiny during the day.  After using it consistently, my skin looks less congested, and the redness I usually get from breakouts has calmed down. It also has this calming effect with a slight tingly feeling, which makes me feel like it’s really working. I’ve noticed that my skin stays clearer longer, and I’m not breaking out as much either.  If you’re looking for a cleanser that targets oil and breakouts but still feels gentle, this one is a must-try. It’s perfect for getting that deep clean without drying out your skin!"

I appreciate that this cleanser is specifically formulated for problematic skin. You can tell immediately that the ingredients are clean and after reading more about the brand it seems like they're organically sourced as well. $88 dollars for a cleanser is quite expensive, though you do get 4 ounces of product and the glass bottle it comes in is luxurious. It does have a scent that some may not appreciate, as it smells like herbs. Personally I don't mind the smell or the bright green color of the cleanser itself. Will continue to enjoy and use this clarifying cleanser daily."

It has green color and so so much fresh smell of aromatic tone and botanical fragrance mint.  I gently scrubbed and massage on my face for 1 minute because the smell was so good. I did not need the warm water to rinse off because it was easy washed by cool water. My skin face felt so fresh, soft, smooth and plumping. The clarifying cleanser left my skin an aromatic scent and so cool mint last longer ever than others aroma products I have used before. I felt my skin deeper clean and so comfortable, the pore was tightened. My skin had no reaction to this cleanser. There is a recommendation to use Clarifying Cleanser as a flash cooling mask for 1 to 2 minutes to feel like home spa.

It performs amazingly and the formula is perfect for everyday use, it lathers well, removes makeup and grime easily, leaves my skin feeling so smooth and glowing I can’t deny any of that. I’ve also noticed that it balanced my skin’s oiliness and cleared my clogged pores (I usually have those little bumps under the skin that are hard to get rid of). However, the scent is the reason for my lower rating. It’s just too overpowering. While I love the herbal smell of all the other products, this particular one is too much.

It doesn’t foam up much, which I prefer because it feels less harsh. The tiny exfoliating bits give a mild scrub without being too rough. Though, the smell is definitely a bit strong, I can’t really pinpoint but the scent is somewhat medical. I use it once a day in the evening, which seems to be enough to keep my skin in good shape without overdoing it. My skin looks less shiny and feels more balanced throughout the day. If you have sensitive skin, like mine, it’s best to use it once a day and see how your skin reacts. For very sensitive skin, doing a patch test first is a good idea. If you’re dealing with breakouts and want a natural, effective cleanser, this one is definitely worth trying."

My skin looked so fresh and exfoliated after and even more the next morning. The only reason I would not give this a 5 stars was because as I used it daily my skin became too sensitive and started to break out more. I did some testing and found it's best if I use this product only when I really need it so once a week or so. I do not recommend it for daily use personally but for when it's truly needed or so I think this product is amazing. Similar to a oil cleanser without the oil aspect. It will do what is intended but overusing it will ruin your skin barrier as it's exfoliating with the acids."

Plus, you can use it as a quick cooling mask by leaving it on for a couple of minutes. Packed with organic ingredients like willow bark extract, wintergreen leaf extract, and lavender oil, this cleanser not only works wonders but also smells divine. LOVE LOVE LOVE!"

This clarifying cleanser helps tremendously with my breakouts without feeling like it is drying my skin out and stripping it of its natural oils. When you first apply it you notice a cool tingly sensation and that’s when you know it’s working its magic. It has an earthy scent to it I’m not hugely fond of. It’s made up of natural derived salicylic acid,  lactic acid and citric acid, as well as the anti-aging prickly pear and the skin-balancing juniper fruit. It does not irritate my skin but instead calms it and reduces the inflammation from my breakout. I apply this on dry skin and massage in then rinse with warm water. My skin has never looked this good! I am absolutely thrilled to find a natural blemish cleanser that actually works!! The beautiful green glass bottles scream luxury! I love everything about this brand!"

The Tata Harper Clarifying Cleanser has been a great addition to my routine. The foaming gel formula is gentle yet effective and has not caused any worsening of my rosacea.

The scent of the product is a little bit strong, so if you are someone who prefers minimally scented or scent free products, this may be too much for you. The elegant glass bottle adds a touch of luxury and eco-friendliness, which I look for in my beauty products. While it is on the pricier side, the quality and soothing results make it a worthwhile investment for maintaining clear, balanced skin.

As someone with combination skin, I've struggled to find a cleanser that effectively removes impurities without stripping my skin of its natural oils. This product has exceeded my expectations in every way.  Firstly, the texture is lightweight and gel-like, making it a breeze to apply and rinse off. The scent is invigorating and citrusy, thanks to the blend of essential oils, which leaves my skin feeling refreshed and energized.  What I love most about this cleanser is its ability to balance my skin's pH. It effectively removes dirt, impurities, and makeup without leaving my skin feeling dry or tight. My pores appear smaller, and my skin looks smoother and more refined. The natural ingredients, including aloe vera and chamomile, soothe and calm my skin, reducing inflammation and redness. I've even noticed a reduction in breakouts since using this cleanser.  Another advantage of this product is its gentle, non-irritating formula. I've used it morning and night without any discomfort or irritation, even around my sensitive eye area. The cleanser is also free of harsh chemicals, artificial fragrances, and dyes, making it perfect for those seeking a natural, plant-based skincare routine.  Overall, I'm thoroughly impressed with the Tata Harper Clarifying Cleanser. It's gentle enough for everyday use, yet effective enough to keep my skin looking and feeling its best. If you're looking for a natural, plant-based cleanser that delivers results, I highly recommend giving this product a try.  Pros:  - Gentle and non-irritating - Effectively removes impurities and makeup - Balances skin's pH - Soothes and calms the skin - Natural, plant-based ingredients - Suitable for all skin types, including sensitive skin - Ideal for everyday use  Cons: None!

First off can we take a moment for the gorgeous glass bottle??!! I’m all about aesthetics and it’s so pretty! When you pump the cleanser it’s a lovely shade of green, not only is it pretty but it smells fantastic!! If you’ve ever been to a luxury spa it smells just like the lobby, fresh, clean & slightly floral with a hint of melon. It’s so good!! After just one wash my skin was feeling soft and moisturized. After using it for a few days my acne cleared and my breakouts have died down significantly. It really helps tone down inflammation and redness and helps keep your skin moisturized and glowy. The gel formula easily works into the skin and gets deep into your pores to give you a clean and fresh face. This face cleanser is a game changer & is certainly worth the price tag!"

I'm my 30's now and still have acne prone skin and this clarifying cleanser has been a life saver. I use it daily at night and it has replaced my other facewash in my skincare routine. This luxurious cleanser is great for problematic skin. I've noticed such an improvement in a little over a week. I typically lean towards having combination skin, but this has never dried my skin out or left it feeling greasy. Makes my skin feel so clean and soft while soothing and exfoliating without drying my skin out. There is a bit of an earthy smell but it doesn't bother me at all. It's not a strong or an offensive odor. It's completely natural, so it's part of it being cleansing and exfoliating facewash using only natural ingredients. I've heard you cab apply it to dry or damp skin. I personally like using it on dry skin and then adding water to it. It only takes a pump or two. A little truly goes a long way. AHAs like lactic and citric acid, gently removes dead skin cells to promote a clearer complexion. It also uses willow bark extract to balance out oilyness. No sulfates are included. Completely natural. It can also be used as a cooling mask. I typically apply and leave on for 1 to 2 minutes. I literally cannot think of one thing negative to say about this product! I absolutely 100% recommend."

NOTHING was overlooked when developing this product, from the packaging to the cleanser itself everything is intentionally luxurious. I have rosacea and have used prescription skincare in the past, but this is far more effective in evening out my skin tone. I have been using this for the past three weeks and have noticed major results. I have acne-prone combination skin and this formula effectively prevents acne, evens out my skin, and leaves it feeling moisturized. The formula is gentle yet effective. It doesn’t appear to be scented and smells “natural” so it shouldn’t affect those who are sensitive to fragrance. A tiny drop goes a long way, and the pump has a little ball on it that you can push to get every last drop out. I love that the bottle is glass so it looks very high-end in my shower.

The kind that never seems to go away, but is just enough there to be seen. My search for an adequate acne product has also been an incredible struggle, especially finding a product that also doesn’t dry my skin out. I have very dry skin to begin with, so I don’t need something else drying me out. However, I was pleasantly surprised when I found this one.   I initially was very excited and hopeful for this cleanser. If I’m being honest, I wanted to see results immediately (don’t we all?!). That just wasn’t the case. However, that doesn’t mean that I didn’t see results after multiple usage!   This clarifying cleanser is one of the most gentle yet effective acne cleanser I have ever used.  After using it for roughly 2 weeks or so, my skin has significantly cleared (see photos below). In addition, prior acne scars have also blurred and don’t stand out as much. My skin doesn’t feel as textured nor has occasional rough patches of skin. Instead my skin looks and feels so soft and radiant.   In addition, the cleanser itself lathers very well, and has a very nice cooling effect. It does have a bit of fragrance to it (more so a “clean” scent) but nothing that I personally find overpowering and bothersome. The pump and glass bottle is also a nice touch, and very functional. I would feel confident traveling with this cleanser if need be as the packaging feels very secure.   Overall, my experience with this cleanser was a good one. However, I would recommend that those who aren’t bothered by fragrances use this rather than the latter. The scent tends to be subtle, but I can imagine it isn’t as subtle to those with more sensitive skin. I also would recommend working your way up to 2 times a day. I made the mistake of using the cleanser twice a day at the beginning and truly believe using x1 a day may help transition your skin to this produc"

			"review_text": "recently tried the Tata Harper Clarifying Cleanser, and overall, my experience was quite positive. Here's a detailed review based on my usage:  Packaging and Presentation: The cleanser comes in a sleek, green glass bottle with a pump dispenser, giving it a luxurious and eco-friendly feel. The pump dispenses the perfect amount of product, making it easy to use without any waste.  Texture and Scent: The cleanser has a gel-like consistency that feels light and refreshing on the skin. It has a mild, herbal scent, which is quite pleasant and not overpowering. The fragrance is likely due to the natural ingredients used in the formulation.  Ingredients: Tata Harper products are known for their natural and organic ingredients, and this cleanser is no exception. It contains a blend of salicylic acid, lactic acid, and a variety of botanical extracts aimed at clarifying and purifying the skin. The absence of synthetic chemicals and fragrances is a big plus for those with sensitive skin.  Effectiveness: Upon application, the cleanser produces a slight tingling sensation, which indicates that the active ingredients are working. After rinsing off, my skin feels clean, refreshed, and not stripped of its natural oils. Over a few weeks of consistent use, I noticed a reduction in the frequency and severity of breakouts. My pores also appeared smaller, and my overall complexion looked clearer and more balanced.  Hydration: Despite its clarifying properties, the cleanser does not leave my skin feeling dry or tight, which is often a concern with products targeting acne-prone skin. My skin felt adequately hydrated, making it suitable for daily use.  Conclusion: The Tata Harper Clarifying Cleanser delivers on its promise of clearer, healthier-looking skin. Its natural formulation, pleasant sensory experience, and effectiveness in reducing breakouts make it a standout product in the realm of luxury skincare. While the price point is high, the results justify the expense for those willing"

			"review_text": "When I learned about the brand Tata Harper, I was really excited to try their Clarifying Cleanser. I have combination skin and struggle with breakouts, especially around my cycle, so I was really interested to see how this product would work for my skin. I really appreciate that Tata Harper’s products are vegetarian and cruelty-free. I also think that it’s really cool that it is made in Vermont and that some of the ingredients are organically farmed! I really liked that the cleanser has ingredients targeted at reducing the appearance of blemishes, like prickly pear enzymes, and ingredients to help balance oil, like cassava tapioca Mojave yucca root. The cleaner has a fairly noticeable fresh, herbal scent, so this might not be the best product for anyone sensitive to scents. It is a gel cleanser, and I found that it foamed and lathered nicely. I thought that this cleanser left my skin feeling clean, without drying it out or making it feel oily, which I really liked. I personally didn’t feel like I saw a very noticeable difference in my acne, but I have been dealing with a lot of stress, which could be contributing to it. I don’t think my acne has gotten worse, but I still have a few problem areas that haven’t shown much improvement. Overall, I do like this cleanser, and I plan to continue using it to see if it works better when I am not dealing with as much stress. I think this could be a good product for people who don’t mind scents and those who have oily/combination skin and acne.  * “This review was collected as part of a promotion”"

The first time I used it, a lot of filament/dirt/blackheads (visible on your fingers when massaging in after a minute) were pulled from my face. I believe that since the first time was so effective, when I went to use it again a few days later, there wasn't much left to pull.

It is very relaxing in the mornings and at night when I was my face. I saw results within only three days which was also awesome."

I will be honest on my first use the grainy liquid immediately caught my eye. As someone who has dry, sensitive and acne prone skin i have learned the hard way that physical exfoliants are not my friends. However this liquid is actually not grainy to the touch at all and as you emulsify it with water it becomes foamy. Which is something i prefer when it comes to cleaning my face. It has a earthy smell that might be strong for some and it does last for a while even after the wash, but i dont mind it since i like the idea that its still working for my skin long after using it. The first use was slightly drying but with continuous use i have noticed my skin looking cleaner and feeling cooler after use. I haven’t experienced the usual tightening and cracking feeling that comes with most over powering cleaners, which again is surprising since it contains AHA exfoliants.   The glass bottle is super luxe, it will look cute on any vanity. The pump makes it easy to control the amount you need.   I use it at night as my step 1 for my night time routine and it works well on days i am using retinol and on days i am using Vit C. I used it to take off my sunscreen and on days i double cleansed after makeup and each time the results were pretty consistent.   I am pretty happy with the product and look forward to continue using it.   This review was collected as part of a promotion"

I’ve noticed my pores are more clear & less clogged resulting in less frequent breakouts. Did I mention this can even be left on your face for 1-2 minutes as a mask? I even took a selfie to show how clear & radiant my skin looks after two weeks of use. 5/5  Overall: This has become my go to AM cleanser as an oily, acne prone skin girlie. This deep cleans my skin leaving my pores clear & less breakouts. Super happy with the scent & how clean & clear my skin looks. 5/5 can’t recommend enough!"

I thought this cleanser from Tara harper would be the one because it has some of the best ingredients for acne and it's made specifically for my type of skin but unfortunately it didn't work as I was hoping. From the first day I started using it, my face broke out in whiteheads. I worked so hard to clear most of my acne and I felt like I am back at square one. I gave it a chance and kept using it to see if maybe my skin would get used to it, that didn't happen, my whiteheads got worst and I had to stop using it. Beside this, I also didn't like how my skin felt and looked after cleansing, this product didn't deliver any of it's promises and for this reason I wouldn't recommend it to anyone ."

I suffer from hormonal acne - I am guaranteed to have a handful of cystic pimples come up on my cheeks or jawline during that one week every month. I timed the use of this cleanser to start a few days prior to the start of my cycle and continued use throughout to see if it would keep my face clear. Let me tell you - I had not ONE pimple come up!! So when it comes to effectiveness, this product works.  Now down to product specifics. This cleanser is thin and watery, doesn’t produce much of a lather, and has a very odd scent. It is a very marine quality - reminiscent of sea moss or seaweed. It is not a pleasant smell in my opinion and could be off putting to some.  That being said, I can look past the smell if it continues to produce results! I am deducting a star only for the product scent, otherwise this would be a 5/5 for me!"

I have fair skin that gets irritated by exposure to the elements, sweat, and salt.  Occasionally I get some fun hormonal acne as well.  The joy!  I am conscious of what's in my skincare, and love products that smell like nature, amd are derived from natural sources. I tried this cleanser to see if it could help with my uneven skin tone, spots, dullness, and roughness.  The first thing I noticed about this cleanser is it comes in an elegant, weighty glass bottle and is a beautiful green.  The cleanser is applied directly to the skin, to allow for maximum effectiveness.   It smells like the best green smoothie you've ever had, and is an extremely pleasurable aromatic experience.   The cleanser is medium thick and not too sticky.  It rubs in well and forms a gentle lather.  Upon rinsing my skin felt fresh and bright.  I used this cleanser at night, before my evening routine.  It took off sunscreen, dirt, and grime without stripping my skin.  After about a week I noticed my face looking brighter, as you can see in the photos (before on the left after on the right).  A little goes a long way and there is still plenty left- which is great because of the price.  This cleanser WORKS! My blemishes went away, and my skin became more soothed and less red after a few short weeks.  It feels luxurious and smells amazing.    Based on my experience, I'd definitely recommend this product, and Tata Harper products to others looking for gentle, effective, luxurious skincare.

This product has done wonders for my acne prone (combination) skin. It gets rid of oil, grime, and makeup so well. I'm left with the cleanest, oil free face. I have actually found a product that helps to clear up my acne and the redness/irritation that comes along with it. So blessed and thankful for that! My face is left smooth and has a glow to it as well. This product has served multiple purposes for me.  The texture is silky smooth and feels luxurious on the skin. It turns into a slight foam like consistency when rubbed between the Palms. It applies and washes off nicely too. The scent of this clarifying cleanser is almost addicting! It smells wonderful- I can smell eucalyptus. I can't quite pin point the other scents that it contains. All I know is that the smell is intoxicating and wonderful! The product is soothing to the skin too. This cleanser could be used on any skin type. It also could be useful for anyone that has any skin irritations or skin problems and also acne prone skin. That's because it's non-irritating to the facial skin. The soothing qualities could help alot of skin issues. I highly recommend this clarifying cleanser from Tata Harper! It's a super great product for sure. I will definitely be purchasing more in the near future!"

Harper Was spending so much money on beauty products, and after a member of her family got skin cancer she realized just how many toxic things are in so many beauty products. Things like antifreeze and formaldehyde. So you're buying beauty products and they are doing damage you may not see for years and years and it's mostly to make shelf lives longer and gives things more texture et cetera and has nothing to do with the skin care itself. Harper Wanted to come up with a skincare solution that's truly good for your skin. She spent years of time working with products that the rest of the industry deemed too expensive or not worth the hassle etc. Living in such a beautiful place like Vermont. She lives among so many awesome natural things she can use in her skin care products. Right now I'm using the Tata Harper Is Clarifying cleanser for problematic skin. It's got twelve high-performance ingredients and it is dermatologist-tested. This cleanser starts out as a gel and turns into a wonderful foaming wash. It's got a green color to it and has a heavenly natural clean scent. Definitely make sure you shake well before you use it. I definitely have problematic skin and even after the first two days of using this face wash, I notice less acne. Acne was not a big problem for me as a kid but after turning thirty it became one LOL. While keeping my break outs at bay, it makes my skin as soft as my nine years! Truly. I know people say they get these results. But I'm truly seeing it every day. I feel so much better because I know what I'm washing my face with, doesn't have horrible for me Chemicals that have no place in beauty products. And I'm seeing the results I've always read about on boxes and wished I had but never got, but now it's actually happening! I know the price point is kind of high but I definitely will be keeping Tata Harper On my shelf!"

It washes away oil buildup and sunscreen.  It is great for my acne prone skin and the blemishes left behind.  It leaves me with a matte finish.

And generally, they have been solid products, some of which are really quite lovely. Today, I share my thoughts on cruelty-free and certified vegetarian Tata Harper Clarifying Cleanser, 125 ml. Like other Tata Harper products, this one comes beautifully presented - in a substantial glass bottle with a pump. Its scent reminds me of a spa day (at home), which I believe comes from its botanical ingredients, such as wild-crafted juniper fruit, prickly pear enzymes, lactic acid from fermented sugar, etc. many of which are from organic farming.  I massage this beautifully colored green cleanser on my wet face before rinsing it with water. It has helped with my oily and clogged areas thanks to the AHA it contains along with other high-performance ingredients, as you can see in my before and after photos.  However, the cleanser is very runny. I often lose the product between my fingers due to its watery consistency. The box also says to shake this well before use. Well, it is not easy to shake this beautiful but heavy glass bottle. The bottom line is that this product did not deliver like other Tata Harper products I have tried."

It hasn't caused my skin any irritation because I only use it 2-3 times a week, but the scent does make my eyes water pretty badly, which I'm not a fan of.

That’s why Tata Harper’s Clarifying Cleanser is my new ally in the battle against blemishes- I’ve begun to incorporate it into my nightly skincare routine and the results have been fantastic. I no longer get oily or break out- it doesn’t matter if I’m stressed out or exposing myself to sweat and other blemish-inducing environmental factors on the track or trail. It deeply cleanses without leaving my skin feeling parched. Its unique formula gives my skin the highly coveted  matte finish I’m always in search of. I simply massage it onto damp skin, allowing its soothing agents like Chlorella, Mint Extract, and Raw Harvested Honey to work their magic while I attend to other tasks, like brushing my teeth, and it leaves my skin looking and feeling radiant and clean. I really appreciate its versatility- in moments of need, I've turned to this cleanser to address occasional breakouts on my back, or have used it as soothing mask to address any redness. I recommend this for any athlete that experiences redness and/or blemishes as a result of sweat and the elements- this cleanser will keep your skin clear and radiant."

It is my first time trying Tata Harper brand and I am really impressed!  First of all the green glass bottle it comes with really caught my eye. It looks so beautiful, soothing and has a beautiful Spring vibe.  This is a foaming gel cleanser that targets impurities and balances oil for clear, comfortably matte skin. The texture is in green color and feels like gel but foams upon water. It foams because of nature, not synthetics as it made with 100% high performance botanical natural ingredients like Cassava Tapioca and Wild Harvested Mojave Yucca. It has a natural minty scent. I use this cleanser both AM and PM and it removes impurities effectively and my skin feels clean and fresh after each use. I also noticed my oily zone is more balanced than before. I did not experience any irritation or dryness which I am pretty happy about.  The bonus of this cleanser is that you can use it as a flash cooling mask by applying and leaving on for 1 to 2 minutes. I’ve been enjoying this little extra quick and easy spa treatment and loved it.  If you need an effective cleanser for blemish-causing impurities and oily skin with natural salicylic acid and AHAs, I’d definitely recommend this beauty!"

This cleanser is for blemish prone skin and for people who have oily skin. I find this cleanser even works great for my combination skin because I love the way my face feels afterwards. This cleanser leaves my face feeling so smooth and clean. It also works so well at removing makeup and I love using this cleanser whenever I have makeup on and I don’t have the time to do a double cleanse.  Also, the green, glass packaging is so beautiful and looks and feels so luxurious. The cleanser has a beautiful bright, herbal, and minty scent. I love that 100% of the ingredients are natural and that the majority of the ingredients are organic. Overall, this clarifying cleanser is so amazing because it provides a deep clean without drying out the skin."

Immediately when I pumped this into my hand, I could smell the delicious scent that makes me feel like I’m in a spa. The product was much more liquidy than I expected, but I don’t mind that.  I applied this to dry skin, since the brand claims this is meant to be used as a treatment, so they don’t want water to dilute the product. After rubbing it in for a few minutes, it started to dry and get very sticky, so I figured it was time to rinse. I rinsed off the product and let me tell you my skin has NEVER been that soft after cleansing! I took a good look at my skin, and somehow after one use it had already shrunk my pores.  I say this with completely sincerity - this is a cleanser that is well worth the price, and I’m so glad I got to try it so now I’m a loyal customer for life"

I myself have breakouts from time to time and am always on the look for a good but non-drying acne product.  This product is gel in texture, and foams/lathers up quite nicely. It contains lactic, salicylic, and citric acid which all help break down dead skin but also with blemishes and to brighten the skin . Honey helps to soothe redness in the skin. It seems to be gentle enough for all skin types to use , it smells botanical, if you are sensitive to scents."

Nowadays I am just looking for clean and effective way to take care of my skin and are always would like to be in the know of what new and exciting things are happening in beauty and aestetics world.  Tata Harper Clarifying Cleanser is coming in the glass bottle and has a very liquidy texture and nice green colour. Added fragrance is not over whelming and does not get stronger with usage or overpower what the product does.  Tata Harper Clarifying Cleanser did feel relatively dry after washing it off the face and before applying any other treatment. Nothing too critical though I try to avoid the cleansers that dry my skin out. Nice medium foam provided good cleansing power for the impurities and this product would be recommended for anyone looking to mattify the skin after just cleansing."

One of Tata Harper’s greatest selling points beside the incredibly and ethically sourced ingredients is the luxurious packaging.

I can’t obsess enough about the packaging. The box it comes in is thick and sturdy, the product itself is in a thick glass bottle. I LOVE IT! The scent of this cleanser is by far my favorite. The scent is the second thing I love about this cleanser. It has a fresh, menthol-y, lavender, eucalyptus, citrusy kind of vibe. I can’t pin point the exact smell but it’s lovely. The ingredients are so healthy and strong all at the same time. This cleanser DOES foam so start by using just a little so you aren’t wasting product. It states 2-3 pumps but I honestly only needed 1-1 1/2 when used.  It spreads nicely over the skin and lathers. It’s a healthy lather which makes me happy! Once you use this product 1 time, you feel squeaky clean. If there was a word for something cleaner than that I would use it. I felt rejuvenated and seriously cleansed once I used this. I wasn’t able to use it every day twice a day because it was too much for my skin as it has areas that aren’t problematic. I rotated it in 2-3 times a week. I love this product and will continue to use it in my routine."

The cleanser's texture is unique, resembling a watery yet stretchy consistency, similar to diluted egg white. Its scent and dark green color, reminiscent of algae, are a bit unusual, and might even be off-putting for some people. Clarifying Cleanser effortlessly transforms from being runny and stretchy to a thick creamy foam which gently cleanses without stripping the skin. Although it is formulated with natural salicylic acid and AHAs, it doesn’t dry out or irritate the skin. The cooling sensation after rinsing was unexpected but appreciated.   I found the cleanser especially effective during periods of hormonal or stress-induced breakouts, clearing my skin within a few days of use.

The clarifying cleanser is green in color and has a gel-like texture. When applied to the face, it turns into a creamy white texture and lathers well when washed with water. It has a minty and earthy smell, but it's not my favorite scent. After using it, my skin is soft and bright, but due to the presence of AHA, it might cause a mild burning sensation. Therefore, I would not recommend it for daily use or to those with sensitive skin. Instead, I suggest using this cleanser for acne-prone skin or when you have blemish problems. In my case, since I have mostly clear skin, it won't be my go-to cleanser. However, having a cleanser with chemical exfoliants would benefit my skin's brightness if I use it once or twice a week."

This cleanser is dark green in color and has a very fresh, minty fragrance. I use this foaming gel cleanser in the morning. It is very easy to use. First, I wet my face. Then I use two pumps of the cleanser and rub it between my hands to activate the product. It starts forming bubbles and then I use the product on my face. This cleanser lathers really well. I gently massage this cleanser on my face for about a minute and then rinse my face with warm water.  My skin feels extremely clean after using this cleanser. And not just clean but my skin feels noticeably silky, smooth and shiny. This cleanser has become a staple in my skincare routine as it's gentle enough for every day use.  I will definitely rebuy this cleanser and can't recommend it enough to anyone who's looking to get clearer and more radiant, smooth looking skin.

I was on the phone with one of my girlfriends and read the ingredients out to her and she even said it sounded amazing lol! I've been using this cleanser since about March of this year (it is now November, Thanksgiving actually) and I'm just now deciding to review it. I guess in the spirit of thanksgiving, I'll say that I'm very grateful for this clarifying cleanser! I use 4x4 esthetic wipes to clean my face and I can see all of the dead skin and dirt being wiped away! Gel cleaners are best for oily skin so this cleanser paired with a great non-comedogenic moisturizer is a MUST have for oily girls like myself! I am a Black woman so I do have enlarged pores and oily skin but this cleanser really helps my skin. I have about maybe another two months before I'm all out, a little has gone a long way! This is my staple cleanser! I'm always confident even when I wear a lot of makeup because I know Tata Harper will save my skin lol! Try it out, you may not regret it!! I sure don't."

You only need 2 pumps into your palm, smash your palms together and rub, then apply to your face.  Add a little bit of water to create a foam and wash away those dirty, clogged pores!  The key is to shake up the bottle, rigourously!  I mean, shake the thing up hard.  Then, pump into your palm. When you shake it, the cleanser turns into a pearly texture vs. a watery one.  Got that tip from the bottle.  It says it right there.  Shake well.  I know this stuff is a high-end cleanser aka expensive, but it is so worth it.  I won't use anything else.

I absolutely love the cooling sensation I get when using this product and I actually enjoy the scent despite the fact that I see a lot of people don't. I love the feeling of luxury when I use this product. I really love how this product cleans the pores. all you need is one pump.  The price is a bit expensive for some thing that isn't made directed towards my skin and I don't need my skin feeling dry this winter. For the value and price I can find some thing that is made for my skin and that will help my skin. so that's my whole reason of returning it.

Was initially looking for a 100% natural fragrance free cleanser to remove my makeup that I could also use for regular washes. Having read the reviews beforehand, I was hesitant regarding the smell mostly, and it looks like a lot of reviewers had a few skin reactions as well.  To me, the smell is very natural herbs, very spa-ish. There’s is definitely a freshness to it which can be aggressive to some, there is menthol and menthyl lactate which I guess are present to enhance the impression of « deep cleanse », like when using Head n Shoulders and your scalp is all freshness. Honestly the mint family’s not made for every skin type. For me, this is exactly what I was looking for. I have normal skin with an acne tendancy in the chin area. This helped me cleared a lot of it and prevent my cheeks from new waves. I would trust the below reviews if you have sensitive and dry skin. That being said, Tata Harper in my opinion remains too expensive compared to other companies in the natural industry such as Josh Rosebrooke for example. Lastly, I think the runny substance is not bad at all! A little goes a VERY long way !"

Even though this product is recommended for Oily & Combination skin & I have have dry skin, I gave it a try anyways. This cleanser worked wonders for my skin! Cleared up my skin without stripping it dry, left it very hydrated. My skin feels softer, smoother & healthier looking. After trying a several Tata Harper's products, I can say I am officially a fan of this skincare line. Highly recommend this item & looking forward to purchasing this cleanser in full size."

I gave away the face wash to a friend who wanted to try it, and it did the same thing for her.  The only positive was the smell. It was very nice. However, the scent did not make up for the damage it did to my skin."

			"review_text": "TLDR; An effective but basic cleanser that does not live up to its luxury price tag.  I'm so disappointed in this product but not for the usual reasons. I received a sample from another retailer for a fragrance purchase and I tried it..mostly because I had no choice and was between cleansers. I have Combo/oily reactive sensitive skin. my beauty regime is non-existent because my skin reacts in an allergic rash to pretty much everything. I have mostly done nothing as far as skincare goes, not even moisturizer because my body seems to prefer it that way.  However, as I approach my fourth decade, I have noticed a general dullness in my complexion and issues with clogged pores and worsening oiliness. I found a cleanser that worked great for a while but now breaks me out as well. Enter this product. Tried and finished the sample. No rash. In addition, my face felt very clean and looked clearer. It also seemed to have cleared the cystic acne I sometimes got. So I decided to purchase a full bottle.  I was shocked at the price tag given the tiny sizes this comes in. I expected this to be about half the price it was. It has no scent that I can detect ( yay for me) it is very watery in consistency which I don't care for but can live with, and the only feeling you get when using it is a Vapo-Rub like tingle. It's green in color. It's about as basic as soap gets.  When your price tag puts you in the same category as Sisley, La Mer, and La Prairie, I need more than green soap. I need wow. I want to be mesmerized. I need to feel like I'm in a spa on the Swiss Alps. Considering I can get clarifying cleansers for $5, I need wow. This isn't wow. It's very Meh. While this works well for me (so well) I cannot justify its price tag. Its bottle would have to be a lot bigger and/or the experience would have to be much more luxuriant for me to keep repurchasing it at this price per ounce.   I'll finish this bottle but have no plans to repurchase. The search for a cleanser goes on."

Companies add menthol to products like this to make you feel like you can ‘feel it working’, but it doesn’t come with added benefit and usually much less is used. I used this after a cleansing balm so my face was already pretty clean. It left behind a film that felt almost powdery, even after rinsing multiple times and using a warm cloth.

BUT, you get used to the smell after a few times, and the strong soothing and cool feeling takes over and it's kind of addicting. But note, because of the menthol ingredient, this might not be good for sensitive skin. The cleanser is very thin and liquid-y, but you don't need to use too much. It also provides mild exfoliation, and afterwards my face feels clean, soft, smooth and even looks glow-y. It is however a bit drying. For reference, my skin is normal/combo. For me, I wouldn't use this twice a day. I think just once a day or even every couple to few days is fine depending on your oiliness. But, I'm finding it to work really well during aunt flow's visit when my face is at it's oiliest. In addition, chlorella algae has a whole slew of amazing benefits, including tons of antioxidants, vitamins a, b, c to help with skin turnover, improve elasticity, as well as reduce redness and inflammation.

I do like how it's green but I was turned off by the smell at the beginning. It's a quite strong minty scent that's almost medicinal, but I got used to it after awhile. Especially when it feels refreshing on the skin the moment it foams up. It's nice to use in the morning to give yourself a wake up.  I have oily combo skin and always tend to get pimples around my chin and jawline. After a month of using this, I haven't had any breakouts! And my acne scars are starting to fade. It gives you a nice deep cleanse without stripping your skin and leaving that uncomfortable tight squeaky clean feeling. Your skin feels soft, brighter and still retains moisture afterwards. I've been using other foaming cleaners up to this point and it always leaves my skin tight and dry.   The redness and blemishes I used to have are reduced and my skin isn't as oily as before, even now as we are entering summer. I just wish the price wasn't a $100 CAD for a bottle. Maybe if it was bigger. But it looks like it'll last me at least 4-5 months so it's worth it imo"

After weeks of dealing with hormonal chin and jaw acne that seemed to be getting worse no matter what I tried, I switched to using this along with the Nourishing Oil Cleanser from Tata. I was worried this one would be too drying for my skin and heard that all of Tata’s products can be mixed. This is exactly the combo my skin needed. My skin feels incredibly smooth and matte after I use this, to the point where I want to keep touching my face! Any texture I had on my skin before is gone and my breakouts have diminished a great deal. Again—I’ve only been using this for THREE DAYS. This cleanser and the Nourishing Oil Cleanser are straight up magical."

I used to only use this at on long days that I was wearing heavy makeup (because it's so pricey!) but after seeing the beautiful results, I've began using it day and night and my skin has never looked better. This cleanses so well without leaving my skin squeaky and uncomfortably clean/dry feeling. I apply it with dry hands on a dry face and massage it into the skin, then rinse off with warm water. It then lathers to a soft foam, and it smells clean and minty. If I need a really deep clean, I will use a facial brush as I'm rinsing with water. This cleanser balances my skin, leaving it refreshed and bright, and free of texture, especially when I use my facial brush (about once or twice a week). Using one pump twice a day doesn't stretch the product very long in my opinion which is kind of disappointing considering the price but I cannot be without this cleanser and I would recommend it to any normal or oily-skinned person who is looking to combat acne, blemishes, or texture."

What ended up happening was that I fell in love and purchased the full size. It's got a nice cooling feeling on your skin and it looks and feels like it has sucked up all the gunk that lives there. Leaves skin soft, smooth, and doesn't dry it out. The product mileage is insane; I only end up needing a few drops to cleanse my entire face.

The past two years or so I have struggled with hormonal acne. While I had managed to get my acne slightly under control using prescription medications, I was still experiencing more blemishes than I would like as a twenty-something. Then insert the clarifying cleanser. I began using this and have never looked back. I never feel as though my skin is stripped, dry, or agitated after using the cleanser. The smell is refreshing and my skin feels awake after use. While it is a dry cleanser I usually get my hands slightly wet and pat my face prior to pumping a small amount and massaging around my face. I use less than a dime-sized amount each time and it gets the job done - which justifies the sticker price for the product to me (plus the fact that my face hasn't looked better in years). To be transparent, along with the oral medication (not accutane) and this clarifying cleanser I also utilize the UFO(morning) and Luna(evening) oils from Sunday Riley following belif's true cream aqua bomb moisturizer. I recently added the luna oil to my regimen but prior had been using the UFO oil morning and night but wanted to try out the addition of Luna. Overall this cleanser is something I will continue to repurchase over and over again."

Until recently my laser genesis esthetician recommended trying something with anti-acne properties so that one pimple that comes and revisits never bothers me. This product is heaven sent, it doesn’t dry out my skin, ever since I’ve been using it, which is about a month, I didn’t get any white heads my blackheads are gone as well. Added bonus is that it’s natural and no toxins will penetrate your skin and go to your body. Although I checked EWG website and it wasn’t their top rated product but it’s pretty clean."

Now that I’ve used it a few weeks (full disclosure, I also added the Clinique Acne Solutions Toner at the same time) my skin is noticably more even, my pores look smaller and my makeup goes on better. A recent bad breakout that started before I used this cleanser cleared right up. It is expensive but one pump goes a long way. I’m using it only twice a day (I usually wash my face three times per day) to help preserve it, but it is so worth the money!"

			"review_text": "This is wonderful on my skin! I have struggled with my acne for 2 yrs now. Once cleansing my face with this clarifying cleanser my pores automatically looked smaller and my acne was not so inflamed. The ingredients are so natural and not too strong. My skin is not sensitive but when it comes to acne my skin overreacts and starts flaming out. This kills the bacteria and sucks out all the bad oils and leaves the good oils in and I feel ten times cleaner and confident that my skin looks healthier."

Using this cleanser, my oil production is exactly the same as well. The minty-cooling of the face is a bit much for me but that's personal preference. You also go through it very quickly, so for the price- this is not worth it."

			"review_text": "I honestly never thought I would find a cleanser that worked. I REALLY never thought I would find one that exceeded my expectations.   I've used high-priced cleansers before so I was hesitant to try this one only to throw it away after a month. Y'all: the reviews are LEGIT. I was in the dermatologist's office EVERY MONTH to have professional microdermabraision to help my adult acne (I'm almost 38) and hyperpigmintation from the old acne. I didn't have widespread acne, but I almost always had a deep zit around my mouth or chin that just about required surgery to eradicate. Since I started using this cleanser, I've cancelled my microderm appointments and have been able to completely stop my prescription acne creams (which insurance no longer covered btw) and the random zit I get heals quickly and the scars dissapear even quicker. I have found the gold standard in my skincare routine and will NEVER be without this again.  Did I mention I've only been using this cleanser for a month? And I started noticing a difference after a WEEK. Trust me. This green bottle is worth it. You truly only need one pump, twice a day."

Hasn't caused any breakouts and i do notice a difference in the pore size on my nose since using this for about 3 weeks now. will be repurchasing! the only downside is the bottle is glass and big so it's hard to travel with but you can just buy a smaller refillable travel bottle"

			"review_text": "I have oily skin but most cleanser still makes my skin feel dry after washing so I've been on a hunt for a natural/organic cleanser.  This cleanser is so expensive and I've not have bought it if not for the VIB sale in April. This cleanser smells very nice, light minty scent.  Its texture is lovely (not too thick nor thin) and you dont need to use a lot.  Because of the minty fragrance, it is very cooling on your skin (lovely for the hot summer).  It does clean well and my skin feels slightly brighten post cleansing.  I am not sure if this breaks me out, however.  I've had a few white heads on my forehead and around my nose since the use of this, but I also have started a few items (skincare and makeup products) that I have yet pinpointed if this is the culprit, hence I did not dock off a star.  Again, it is expensive, but if it indeed does not break me out, then it is worth it.  Side note: the bottle is gorgeous on my counter!"

			"review_text": "Whoa. I read the description and the initial 8 reviews and thought to myself I've found the perfect product so throw that in the basket and buy it. Then it sold out, eventually was able to buy it. Tried that night and immediately was impressed. The smell...well it's strong. I'm not in love with it. But as I was rubbing it on my face I could feel the cooling start, and it just felt refreshing. My face gets dry really easily so after I washed it off I could feel it getting dry, but not as bad as other products. I sprayed my toner on, then my Lapis face oil. In the morning - oh my word. I felt like I could have walked right out of the house no make up. I felt positively radiant. I have been dealing with some breakouts recently, which causes redness. And I honestly felt like things had improved overnight. I have only used this a couple of days, so I'll update later...but I am so impressed. This mixed with my Herbivore stuff I think I'm set. If you've got some concerns about unbalanced skin etc...GIVE THIS A TRY. Will check out other Tata products now."

I would LOVE nothing more than to switch over to this brand entirely but the prices are horrendous."
