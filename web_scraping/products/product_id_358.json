			"review_text": "This product is fantastic, and I love the resultsâ€”but the price for the mini size is disappointing! It's $27 plus tax for just 13g, while the full size is $92 for 74g. By that math, the mini should cost closer to $16. The only other option is the full size, so it feels a bit unfair for those of us wanting to try a smaller amount. Iâ€™d happily buy the mini if it were more reasonably priced! Going to try a DIY rice flour scrub next time. It's like SAMPLE size ðŸ˜­"

It still is problematic with the dispensing system, but I found a way to keep it dry."

I would recommend starting with the small size and seeing how your skin responds to it before going for the larger bottle."
