Specifically formulated to target damaged hair, it effectively fortifies weakened strands and minimizes breakage. As someone grappling with damaged hair, particularly dry and prone-to-split-ends ends, this treatment has proven to be a game-changer. Notably, its delightful scent adds to its allure, with a perfume-like aroma that I find irresistible. I have a penchant for scented products, and this live-in treatment not only nourishes my hair but also leaves it smelling divine. The texture resembles that of a gel cream, making it easy to apply throughout the hair despite its runny consistency. By diligently using this product on damaged hair, I've experienced notable hydration, effectively warding off split ends and maintaining a delightful scent throughout the day. I wholeheartedly recommend this treatment for anyone struggling with damaged hair, particularly those plagued by dry and split ends. Its transformative effects are truly remarkable, especially in combating split ends."

I received this complimentary from Function of Beauty and I honestly wasn’t sure how much I would use it, but it’s a total multitasker! I have thick, color treated hair that soaks up hydration so I add a few pumps when I get out of the shower AND a bit when it’s dry.  It’s great for helping tame my hair and I add a pump here and there during the day to get my hair looking smooth and tailored.  I especially love that it also protects my hair from heat styling up to a really high temperature because I like my hair tools really hot, so this is a huge plus for me. It doesn’t leave any buildup or residue, and p.s. it feels amazing."

My natural hair is mostly straight with a slight wave in it, and it’s pretty thick. My hair is not frizzy but I wouldn’t consider it naturally smooth either. I definitely have noticed a difference when using this product. My hair feels much smoother and softer to the touch. It also looks a bit more silky. I thought the concept of this product was pretty neat as well. I have never had a product where I had to add a concentrate to it, so that was pretty cool. It was super easy to do and didn’t take much time. I would absolutely recommend this product and love that it works for a variety of hair types."
