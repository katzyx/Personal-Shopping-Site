I’m confused as to why they launched these three “brighteners” though. I use Airy setting powder in the winter and Breezy in the summer, so I purchased Candy hoping to add some brightness under my eyes and on my cheeks… no such luck. It does give my skin a slightly cooler look, compared to the neutral/warm of my regular powders though. I plan to use it all over my face in place of Airy this winter when I want to do cool makeup looks, but it isn’t worth purchasing as a “brightener.” Mmm in the summer"

I usually don’t use on my under eyes because makeup always creases there but decided to try it with this and it set my makeuo very good I had very minimal creasing almost none.

I did touch up later in the day in a couple areas but I was nitpicking and it likely wasn't needed.    If I had to find anything to fault with this product, it would be with the clasp on the container itself. It's a very tight clasp and I struggled to open it with two hands. I really love being able to open my compacts with one hand or at very least with brush in one hand assisting the other. This was frustrating and a time wasted.

I also appreciate the minimalist packaging—it’s compact and looks sleek on my vanity.  However, there are a few drawbacks. If you have dry skin, this powder might emphasize those areas. I found that it clung to some dry patches, even after moisturizing. Additionally, it doesn’t blur pores as much as I’d hoped, so if you’re looking for a more smoothing effect, this may fall short. While it’s a nice addition for oil control, it might not be everyone’s favorite depending on skin type."

However, a month after purchasing this product it broke, the semicircular shape they give to this powder always breaks, I’ve seen it on other products too. However since I loved the formula so much I decided to keep using it until the clasp that keeps the lid and the bottom together kind of disintegrated (plastic) and broke. It was a struggle to use so I simply threw it away. Hope they improve it since it is a great formula but it has a lot of defects specially considering it’s a bit pricey for such a small thing."
