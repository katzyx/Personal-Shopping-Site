	"about": "Fragrance Family: Warm & Spicy..Scent Type: Warm & Sheer..Key Notes: Rose, Nude Musk, Vanilla..Fragrance Description: ROSIE is all white musk. It’s the top, middle and base note but we added just a hint of pure ROSE oil to ground and open up the senses. This fragrance will mold itself to you- making it unique to ONLY you. Rosie leaves skin smelling of clean and calm...About the Fragrance: Inspired by naked skin with notes of nude musk and sweet rose..FEELS LIKE: Sleeping in your birthday suit. Nude + translucent..Clean & Planet AwareOur ambitious curation of beauty made without controversial ingredients from brands dedicated to making meaningful environmental commitments, including sustainable ingredients and sourcing, packaging, corporate commitments, and consumer transparency.",
	"ingredients": "Organic Cane Sugar Alcohol And Distilled Water, Ambrettolide, Ambroxan, Dipropylene Glycol, Ethylene Brassylate......The list of ingredients is subject to change, please consult the packaging of the product purchased.",
	"how_to_use": "Suggested Usage:.-Fragrance is intensified by the warmth of your own body. Apply in the creases of your knees and elbows for a longer-lasting, stronger scent.&nbsp;.-After applying, avoid rubbing or dabbing skin. This breaks down the fragrance, causing it to wear off more quickly.&nbsp;.-If you prefer placing fragrance on your wrists, be sure to reapply after frequent hand-washing, as this tends to rinse off the scent.&nbsp;.-Replace fragrance after 12 months. Expired perfumes more than a year old lose the integrity of the original scent....We work hard, so you don’t have too!  ALL by Rosie Jane packaging is recyclable..How to be a cool human:.- Remove pump and sprayer from our bottles, rinse and throw into your home recycle bin..- Our boxes too!!.- You can return the sprayer and pumps back to By Rosie Jane and we will recycle them for you and also give you a little gift in return....Eau de Toilette or Eau de Parfum?:.The difference lies in the volume of perfume oil. While EDT contains five to nine percent, EDP contains more, usually eight to 14 percent. EDPs, therefore, last longer and smell more intense.",

It’s super feminine and beautiful. I personally feel that this is a very unique scent, I have never smelt anything like it before.

It’s such a gorgeous scent—delicate, clean, and super feminine. It’s one of those fragrances that makes you feel like you just stepped out of a spa, fresh and put-together. What’s interesting is that it’s a parfum, but the texture feels a little thicker, almost like a parfum oil. I actually have to rub it in when I apply it, which I didn’t mind at all. It kind of makes it feel more luxe and special to me. LOL Honestly, I’m obsessed, and I can already tell this is going to be one of those things I will buy again. It’s just that good. If you’re ever looking for something soft and classy that still feels unique, this is definitely worth trying."

A perfect office scent, but also great for a date. I just love it. This may become my new signature scent!"

I finally found it and I'm so happy! But I BEG you to please come out with a 'Rosie Intense' or 'Rosier' version with this exact same scent just . . . more of it.  It's too beautiful of a smell to be this ghostly. It doesn't linger long enough, either. I don't like loud or cloying scents, but if Rosie were kicked up a notch it would be such a perfect fragrance.   As for what season this would work best in, I'd say it's tricky because to me if smells like if you laid a single fresh rose petal covered in iridescent dew drops over a pristine snowfall. I think this one is so inoffensive and subtle that it'll be a standout in any season!"

			"review_buyer_description": "",
			"review_text": "The old formulation was intoxicating— a sweet blend of roses, white musk, and vanilla. It was a warm and delicate skin scent that still had decent lasting power. They stopped producing that version some time in 2020-2021 in order to make the perfume “more natural.”  This new version most notably removed the Rosa damascena oil from its ingredients (among several other changes) and is an oily, slightly sweet musk that doesn’t hold a candle to the original. The sweetness combined with the musk, without floral and vanilla notes for balance, just makes it smell sickly after a while. My friend still wears it but we both wish to see the previous version come back."

When I sprayed it on me and smelled it throughout the day, it smelled nothing like when I tested it. I let the bottle sit/ macerate for a couple of days and now it is starting to smell as it did in-store. The in-store tester bottles sit out for much longer and are sprayed more often compared to the new bottle. The last con is the low staying power, although I enjoy the scent so I will be keeping my bottle."

			"review_buyer_description": "Brown eyes, black hair, Deep skin tone, Oily skin",
			"review_text": "This is the BEST way to experience and enjoy the Rosie scent. Here’s why: The body wash isn’t anything special but it is nice to have something without such a strong scent. But.. with that said you can barely smell the Rosie scent which seems to be a theme of this brand. Don’t get me wrong Rosie is my favorite scent so I’ve bought a lot of the Rosie scented products from byrosiejane on Sephora and their actual site including the perfume oil, body oil, candle, body wash, travel, and full size. Unfortunately, most don’t give off the Rosie scent very well or as well as the Perfume does. For the body wash there seems to be an inconsistency with the texture/ look. The 1st one I received had a see-through yellow tint which showed the dispense tube and now the rest resemble a yellow foggy milk leaving the tube unseen. Maybe they’ve changed the formula, as now site photos seemed to have changed a little as well, idk. The Body oil does indeed smell like cooking oil like others have mentioned especially while applying. I am only able to smell the Rosie scent from the body oil once it has dried into my skin and still it is ever so slight. It does make my skin soft but a little doesn’t necessarily go a long way. For the candle well lets be honest here; It smells nice but does not smell like the intended Rosie scent. Smells more like a very soft cotton linen with a hint of coconut since that is the “wax” used. As for the perfume oil well the Spray is better for me as in the perfume oil I can distinctively smell the oil used along with the Rosie scent though doesn’t give any hint of coconut like the candle somewhat does. But if you do find yourself wanting the other products I suggest adding the Perfume spray to your cart in tandem to get the best out of the Rosie fragrance routine. The Rosie fragrance really is a clean, just washed, calm, and girly yet no frills scent."

To me, they were all either missing something or skewed a little too musky, or peppery, or sweet, or something else. In my opinion this one is the most balanced and wearable. It is soft, slightly floral and slightly sweet (but not at all cloying) and lightly musky and airy. My young daughter gave me a hug and just inhaled. I asked if she liked it and she sighed and said it smells wonderful, like you mommy and then proceeded to inhale some more. That's the best I can describe it - it smells like skin but better. This is NOT a statement perfume, people will not notice it when you walk into a room, if that's what you are looking for then this is not for you. It's good for an office or close quarters where you don't want to announce your scent to other people but you would still like a little something extra.  I started off with the travel size of this perfume to test it out but I will be purchasing the larger size when I run out."

A friend of mine at church says I smell like heaven when I wear my Rosie perfume 😇 I also love the longevity of this perfume. It has a nice clean scent, but it’s not overpowering like some perfumes can be. I also wear Dylan by Rosie Jane sometimes, and it has a similar scent in my opinion. If you’re on the fence about this perfume you will not be disappointed with your purchase!! It’s very giftable too. As you can see in my pictures, it’s time for me to reorder again."

I spent a long time looking for a new perfume because I was getting a bit tired of my previous one (Glossier You) and wanted something else that was less perfumey and more natural smelling. This perfume is very subtle and not overwhelming, which is an issue I often have with perfumes. To me it smells like fresh laundry, and I love that I can put on a couple sprays without worrying whether it will give me a headache later in the day. Often I forget I'm wearing it and then once in a while I'll get a nice subtle whiff, which is my preference. I have had people tell me that they can't really smell it, so if you like stronger scents it might not be for you. But if you're going for something light and effortless feeling I think this is a great choice!"

You will not overwhelm the room with this perfume and you can layer with other Rosie scents (such as adding Lake for evening).  I get stopped at the gas pump, while working at volunteer events, by tennis partners, by friends, and by strangers at the airport asking me what perfume I am wearing. I should walk around with tiny samples to hand out for as often as I get asked about the scent I am wearing. I know firsthand that several people have converted to this perfume and are now diehard Rosie Jane fans like me. You won't regret this purchase.

The OG Rosie was heavenly, it just smelled clean, like you just got out of the shower, with a touch of delicate rose. I loved that scent and went through bottle after bottle. I recently ordered a new bottle and to my dismay it smelled completely different, like many others have mentioned in the reviews. This just smells like dirty, musky water. I reached out to By Rosie Jane trying to figure out if this was a bad batch or just an actual change in formulation. I received an email response from their team confirming that indeed they changed the formula about a year ago to, in their words, make it cleaner and safer, and that this can also cause a shift in the scent. So there you have it. Our beloved Rosie is no more. I do not recommend this new version of the scent at all, it smells really awful. What a shame."

It opened with a watered down honeysuckle note with a baby powder base.   I’m reading folks having a bad batch so maybe that is it or the oil is better suited to my body chemistry.

I've seen this perfumed described different ways; on me, it is a powdery rose and light musk scent, very feminine and soft. It is a very light perfume, so one would have to be standing very closely to get a whiff. I cannot stand perfumes with patchouli or citrus (great on others, but terrible on me), and so I gravitate towards the floral and the light musky/spicy fragrances. If you liked the way Amazing Grace used to smell, this one is similar, at least note-wise."

I will note that there are a couple of differences. The musk is essentially the same and they smell really similar, but the powdery notes in this scent come from the rose. I've been on the hunt for a skin scent and this one comes closest to evoking feelings of warm solar. However, I would argue that the projection is not nearly as strong (I tried the solid and perfume version of You) but you will still get whiffs of it while wearing, even from the initial two spritz I put on my wrists. It's definitely good if you are someone who might get a headache from rose scents as it's not overpowering. I would buy while you still can."

After going through two bottles of the travel size (because that’s all that was available at time of the purchases), I finally managed to snag a full sized bottle. Now the real Rosie is a 5-star scent. It just smells clean, fresh and floral, like you just got out of a shower. It’s the perfect minimalist scent for people who just love smelling delicately clean. However, the full sized bottle that I just received smells like musky water. It smells so bad it’s revolting. It’s not that it’s a different perfume that got mislabeled, it’s just quite literally a funky musky smelling water. By Rosie Jane clearly has some serious quality control issues going on. I’m leaving this review in hopes to help pressure them to get better. Buyer beware!"

I tried this out in the concentrated fragrance oil and the scent was weak and barely there- so I can only imagine the bottled, liquid perfume would be EVEN worse! This is extremely reminiscent to Lake & Skye’s 11 11, but in a not as good version. 11 11 is much stronger in its projection/sillage and that fragrance oil lasts well into the next day! I recommend trying that scent if you’re after a nude musk (it has white amber notes as well) from a clean fragrance house! Rosie is such a disappointing scent. Again, there is no detectable rose or vanilla at all! Smells like a men’s cologne as well, since it’s just pure ozonic musk. There’s nothing feminine here. Will be returning!"

			"review_text": "I’m genuinely torn on rating this product. On one hand, Rosie is the most incredible scent I’ve found to date. On the other is the fact that this is the most inconsistent perfume I’ve ever (repeatedly) purchased. I discovered this scent when I ordered a trial size roller set with five scents— all great but Rosie was my favorite and I fell in love. It lasted all day without being overpowering, it was a light oil based feel without being greasy or heavy, and it was one of those scents you put on and feel good. I was sold so I ordered the full size roller, excited to get more of this incredible perfume. The full size comes in and it’s completely different from the mini in it’s consistency/scent/wear time/etc— in that it fell grossly short. I was furiously shaking the bottle before applying it to see if mixing it helped and applying way more than I had or should, to no avail. So I figured I just got a bad batch and ordered the largest spray size thinking it’ll be good, no worries. The scent was better but it lasted maybe 30 minutes (if that) in terms of wear time and once again I was using more to compensate. I’m now bummed because again, I love this scent so I think back to the first trial size set I ordered, hoping to find the small roller I got which knocked my socks off. I could only find a spray trial size (but thought little of it) only to find that, you guessed it, I was wrong yet again. Other than the full size roller, which seemed full on defective, I wouldn’t say the products were bad… just wildly inconsistent in a way that makes me wish I hadn’t spent a couple hundred dollars buying what *should be the same product* and chasing after what I still believe to be the perfect scent for me. I understand that a natural perfume might have some variations from batch to batch but this is way beyond the realm of reasonable considering the cost. It’s a shame because honestly, it smells so darn good."

I later splurged on a full-sized oil here from Sephora and was absolutely crushed to discover they had changed the formula and the smell couldn’t even begin to compare. Not to be melodramatic, but it completely ruined my entire day. I couldn’t stop thinking about this ethereal perfume for months. I kept my tiny little sample and would very occasionally dab a little drop on my arm and smell it with delight and melancholy. I bought a few bottles from ebay, hoping they were somebody’s “old stock” bottles, but was disappointed each time. In a final attempt, I bought this small spray bottle now (wondering if perhaps the spray and oil versions would be different) and was shocked to discover it smells EXACTLY like the scent I fell in love with! I’m hoping against hope that the company brought the old scent back, and that this isn’t just leftover bottles from the old good version. I know this review is exceedingly dramatic but I hope the Rosie Jane team occasionally reads reviews here and knows how beloved the original is. If you have brought it back, thank you so, so much!"

Rosie is perfect - warm, clean, with just enough floral to perk it up and a balanced and comforting base to bring it to earth.  I tried the sample set first and knew Rosie was the one.   The reason I didn’t give the 5th star is because I wish the fragrance lasted a little bit longer on my skin."

I don't like when perfume lingers for many, many hours or into the next day.  I appreciate that these gently fade and don't leave a lingering half scent that you can't wash off.      Fragrance that has that kind of staying power kind of freaks me out.  Rosie is my favorite everyday scent.  It smells clean and warm and gentle to me and not powdery.  I have gone through a travel spray and the oil so far and just purchased my second travel spray.  I got a sample of the Dylan perfume oil recently and just purchased that in the travel spray.  I like how fresh Dylan smells and I definitely smell the cedar notes most.  This fall, I plan to purchase the James perfume, which I currently have in the body oil from their website.  It is a lovely cooler weather scent."

I loved the light, clean scent from the oil version of this I received as a sample, so I figured the perfume would smell a little stronger than the oil. I was wrong, there is barely any smell. I want to return it but it will take forever due to the shipping regulations because it’s perfume, and by the time I receive reimbursement, it will be at least 3 weeks! Makes it seem like more of a headache. Will probably keep and use in combination with oil, but will not be purchasing again. Stick with the oil, and even then, it fades too quickly.

I tried the discovery scent box and now got Rosie in full size since it was my favorite out of all of them (though I liked all of them, you can't go wrong with their other fragrances!)  This is just so inviting as a scent, and it does linger all day on your clothes or close to your skin.  So I think what all of these people who are saying it doesn't last are talking about is sillage; it is not like fragrances that have a high sillage in the cloud that causes your coworkers to sneeze or cough after you waft by.  It sits close to the skin and can be smelled by yourself and someone sitting close to you, not the whole room which I greatly prefer. It definitely will still be on your wrist at the end of the day. I have a sensitive nose and am allergic to everything under the sun so these clean perfumes work much better for me, no headaches or sneezing.  I like a little warmth and depth to floral scents to off set the sweet or grandma type of smell, so the white musk is a great addition to the rose."

It's light and inoffensive. I don't smell rose at all, but it's slightly floral and fresh. The only bummer is it doesn't last nearly long enough (2 hours tops) and initially smells a lot like alcohol (which is VERY strange for an Eau de Parfum). However, as soon as it dries down it's outright heavenly! My other favorites include Burberry Brit Sheer and Pacifica Power House. I would love this in a"

			"review_text": "Can’t get enough of scents by Rosie Jane, this one smells so good if you like musk scents; BUT, the only way to get even a hint of the incredible smell is to pretty much bath in it (gross) or just put a dab under your nose (weird).... it does smell that good though. There is a strong alcohol scent before it dries down and I think this brand hand mixes so maybe this is a bad batch or someone messed up on the amounts. I’m curious if the oil may be better, but I’m not interested in such a small bottle. I hope they will reformulate this, it really is a lovely scent."

Recently bought a full bottle but learned it was the original formulation with more musk, which did not work for me. Distraught, I contacted By Rosie Jane and learned their latest formulation is the one that I love. I simply exchanged the bottle for the new one and I couldn't be happier!"

I even tested the larger and smaller one to compare. So I then purchased another smaller size since my other smaller size was almost gone. again no scent. I don't know if the company has changed the composition but the current bottle contents have little smell and do not smell at all like the smaller size I purchased while ago. I will be returning both recent purchases. so disappointed!"

Its a great daytime fragrance so if your looking for a very bold fragrance for a night on the town then this isn’t for you. I even use this on days when I decide to stay in. I’m not exactly sure if it’s staying power and that’s why I knocked off one star but would have actually ranked this 4 1/2 stars if I could. Overall, I love it and would buy again."

It lingers in my hair at the back of my neck and seems to stick a little more if I put oil on my skin but it has a high alcohol smell when first sprayed which is why I think it does not last as much. For an “eau de parfum” that is unusual to smell alcohol in first spritz. I’m hoping my bottle was old and when I purchase the next it will be better because like I said, I love the scent."

I personally love the smell of roses and vanilla so this sounded perfect to me. The bottle and packaging are recycable and very cute. But I was so shocked when I smelled it first the first time and I wore to work every single day since I bought it. I realized it barely smelled even when I sprayed a couple extra pssttts I literally couldn’t smell anything. The smell is so faint that it’s actually barely there and the worst part is that the scent disappears within about just 2 hours. But the perfume itself did not irritate my sensitive skin. It was actually very gentle and did not dry my skin out. I might try her other products tho in the future but at this time not really liking this perfume."
