			"review_text": "Ok... when this came out I didn't purchase it because it seemed somewhat boring. However, I picked it up after seeing it in Sephora and I haven't put it down since (which is saying a lot as I have MANY palettes to choose from). I've enjoyed it thus far because I can easily use it as an everyday palette and also have a nice pop of color without ending up with a look that isn't very wearable. The shimmers are VERY smooth and easy to work with, as I've been applying most of those with my finger, and the mattes have blended like a dream. As someone who isn't 20 anymore, it looks very good on my eyelids. This palette has surprised me bc I'll admit, I'd written it off, but I'm so glad I tried it bc I have zero regrets."

			"review_buyer_description": "Brown eyes, black hair, Tan skin tone, Combination skin",
			"review_text": "Great for deeper skinned girlies - all the colors work!  I tend not to go for too heavy handed looks and actually  like to use the  mattes for one-and-done shadows with a light diffused touch for a natural smokey eye for daytime.  The purple and brown tones are just perfect! It lasts all day and blends beautifully. The shimmers are great to kick up a notch for night.  To note, the shimmers are a little dry compared to old abh formulations. That said they still perform great and last all day. Watch out for some fall out though."

			"review_text": "I am a big fan of Anastasia products but this palette seems to have been formulated differently.  The shimmers give enormous fall out but don't last all day at all, the colour depth of them is also questionable.  Usually, palettes from Anastasia are amazing so they are an instant order but this makes me rethink that.  It was an expensive palette for not a great quality this time around."

If you have an olive undertone, you may want to consider looking at this one! The online photos don't do it justice. (For example, Fireside isn't actually orange, and Crown has lovely olive green flecks, but it's more of a burnished gold base.) Until Fall Romance and Nouveau, I had entirely given up on mainstream eyeshadow palettes... I'm a slightly warm-leaning, neutral olive. (Light to light-medium in depth.) Something is definitely working for me, here."

A few of the matte shades have shimmer in them so they make fantastic lid shades and again I was impressed with the creamy formula and the way the shadows were perfectly pressed. Now this palette will need to be partnered with another palette in case you enjoy more transition shades to go with these shadows. However the quality and richness is there for this product and I do recommend trying it for yourself."

			"review_text": "I do like this one to pair with the other ABH palettes, I feel the formula here should be easier picked up with a dense brush and packed on because the mattes are more like a pressed pigment.   Similar to JStar eye shadows.  I think ppl are confused on how to use a pressed pigment formula.  Using your finger helps for the shimmers and a really good base.  The mattes are like a pressed pigment not eyeshadow so maybe ABH used a different pigment formula than prior.  I will take off 1 star for the shimmer fall out.  But it's a nice palette, you just can't use a fluffy brush.  You want a dense brush with this for it to work."

I can see how the mattes might be patchy for people, especially if you have dry skin. I’ve found it works with my UD primer potion fine. Definitely gonna be my go to Fall palette 🖤"

It is a deep, dark purple hue with little shimmer or glitter. The bright, shimmery,  pink in the photos is not what you will receive!"
