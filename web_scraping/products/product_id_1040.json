			"review_text": "I saw a lip combo on TikTok with this liner and a brown lip treatment. I hate bright reds and I can’t decide whether I like a cool or warm tone red. I also am so picky with lip colors. I don’t like a burgundy or maroon shade, I don’t like an orangey firetruck red, or a blue leaning red. I love using browns and pinks on my lips. But I had a holiday party coming up and I wanted a festive lip. After seeing that video on TikTok, it looked gorgeous! Immediately purchased. I have to say, this is my favorite red. I even wear it just for a regular day. It can be packed on for a more pigmented look, or lightly applied for a subtle flush on the lips. I always pair this with a brown gloss or lip treatment. Plus, it’s a makeup forced lip liner - you can’t go wrong!"

I was looking for something that looked like my lips but slightly darker, and this was it. Goes on smoothly, and the liner isn’t too soft that I have to worry it’ll break, and not too hard where I feel like I’m poking myself every time I go to apply. However, the lasting power was just not there and it would smudge easily if I went to apply gloss over it and just throughout the day, just a few hours in."

Although I have been blessed with naturally very full lips, at 47, they have lost a little of their fullness. This lip liner adds an incredible fullness!! I tend to have very dry lips, so like another reviewer, I use this liner with Summer Fridays Lip Balm for an easy, every day look. I love Anywhere Caffeine with either Iced Latte or Hot Cocoa S F., and Wherever Walnut with either Vanilla or Pink Sugar S.F. Wherever Walnut also looks good with Charlotte Tilbury Pillowtalk Original lipstick! I do find that the staying power is less when paired with a gloss, but that's to be expected. it definitely lasts a long time with lipstick. This lip liner is an absolute winner!!!"

I’m only giving it 4 stars because I really don’t like actual lip pencils that I have to sharpen and prefer the mechanical ones I can just twist up. Aside from my personal packaging preferences, the formula of this is fantastic. It is super creamy and easy to apply. I like to fill my lips partially in with the liner and use a lighter lip color on the inner part and this liner has the perfect formula for doing that. I wouldn’t describe this as being a rose brown though. It’s definitely more of a neutral brown tone when applied. Could just be how it shows up on me, but I love this shade regardless. It pairs really well with a lot of my lip products. I was using the Rare Beauty liner until it broke so I have no complaints about the price. You definitely get what you pay for. This liner has incredible staying power and even if whatever product I pair it with wears off this is still there and I still look like my lips are done. Definitely recommend this, just wish there was a mechanical version."

Not gonna stop me, it's a small thing that I preferred the way they used to name them. While this is not my favorite shade, I do like the pencil itself.
