I love how it enhances my natural lashes without feeling heavy or weighed down. Plus, it lasts all day without flaking or smudging. If you're looking for a mascara that delivers on its promises, I highly recommend giving this one a try!"

This is definitely a more creamy feel, but its heavy and clumpy, but somehow doesn't do a great job of popping your eyelashes. I feel like its probably a tradeoff, and no true product exists to do it ALL - but I MUCH prefer the Ilia mascara as a product as a whole."

I oftentimes miss doing my lash care at night, but can’t go a day without mascara, so this product was perfect for thickening the lashes and lengthening them over time! The formula is similar to the Better than Sex mascara, but I like this better! I find that it is extremely volumizing as soon as you put it on. My favorite thing about it is you don’t even need to put multiple coats, so it’s perfect for when you’re getting ready quick in the morning! I also love the gold packaging, it makes me feel expensive. In my picture, you can see the before (left) and after (right). Get it if you can!!!"

I have tried every mascara from Too Faced Better than Sex to Giorgio Armani Eyes to Kill and it took castor oil in the tube to get the perfect product (for me anyway).  But seriously, I have tried every mascara Sephora offers over many years and this is what I need and in my opinion is THE BOMB!  I am a woman over 50 and clumped mascara on my lashes is not a good look at my age."

I bought this for the wand to cover all of them in one swoop and it does that, but it’s not like out of this world. I would hope at this point the formula didn’t flake! Haha I think it would have to have a super cheap formula in order to flake. I do like the fact that it has castor oil like it would help eventually make the eyelashes longer. Only time will tell!"

I typically use mascaras that provide volume, length, and curl, and I was actually impressed that this did help provide some lengthening and curl as well.   I’ve been struggling to find a mascara that stays on all day without flaking or smudging to my under eye area. This one stayed all day without any smudging or flaking, even on a 95°F day!   I don’t know if I can really speak to the “thickening” aspect that this is supposed to provide, as I didn’t really notice any effects from the castor oil.   The brush is okay, it’s not my favorite, but it works. So be aware though- I’m used to putting in multiple layers of mascara to get the effects I like, but I would not recommend applying more than a layer or two of this. It will get veeeery clumpy.   Overall, I think it’s a pretty good mascara that I am happy to continue using!"

I felt like I couldn’t get enough coating and thickening effects with one or two swipes as the instructions state, however it was a fine line to applying too much mascara and getting very spidery looking lashes. I haven’t used a mascara with castor oil ever either and didn’t find it to provide the shine and glossiness the description emphasizes. I think due to the shortness of my lashes I am better suited with a lengthening mascara which this doesn’t provide. The positives-It was easy to remove and lasted all day! I’d say just make sure it has the features you want before you splurge!"

Meet GrandeDrama! This mascara does exactly what I have been looking for all this time. At first I was worried a out the almost “messy” looking applicator but it is great for applying the mascara to my lashes. This mascara manages to coat and define each individual lash making my lashes appear thicker and darker. It also slightly adds length, but nothing to dramatic, for a natural look.

And this dramatically awakens my eyes and makes them look fabulous! I didn’t have an issue with drying nor did I find a need to reapply after. My eyelashes were instantly darkened, thickened, and lengthened. The container it comes in is a nice thick and hearty tube. Looks sleek and good to hold. The brush is bushy and shaped perfectly to reach each lash.  I will not be without this. Ever. One pic I’m attaching shows one eye done and one not done.

I'm a physician and power through each day, putting my face and body through the wringer so staying power that doesn't run is HUGE. My lashes are better conditioned, softer and the mascara goes on seamlessly with ease. I'm a seasoned application performer so maybe I'm just used to special techniques, but it's incredible for me."

I've got deep set eyes which, as one gotten older, have given me a look as of my eyes are sunken in....  Since I started wearing mascara when I was 14-15 (I'm 59 now) mascara that help my eyelash game has been elusive. I've tried every drugstore brand imaginable for the past 44 years. I've tried premium brands and, seriously, for the money, there's 0 difference other than the money wasted to have a brand name. Actually, I've generally had superior luck with the drugstore brands.  This year, I joined the millions of others and joined subscription boxes (Ipsy & BoxyCharm). I've always loved makeup, they just feed that makeup obsession. It doesn't matter I'm older now, I still love makeup, but I wear far less now. Yes, I'm getting to the actual review, it needed back story though...  When I received this in one of my boxes, I thought, oh, great, another disappointing mascara. I saw where it contains castor oil, then I became curious. I started to apply and with each stroke of the brush, I literally saw a complete and shocking transformation of my eye lashes! They look like false lashes. Thick, not clumpy, long and with a sweeping curl not even the best of eyelash curlers could compete with! I'm ordering a new tube now and will continue to do so. I wish it had been a drugstore brand (so does my wallet), with these results...but, my 40+ journey to find a mascara I love has come to an end at last (at least until it stops providing these results. ❤️"

I’m actually not sure how I got it; it may have been in a subscription box, but I don’t usually go for intense volume mascaras. I am always, always on the hunt for lengthening mascaras, however. As such, just by name only, this was not on my radar. But, I had it lying around and figured I would try it before handing it off to a friend. Holy smokes! This is THE mascara I’ve been searching for! I’ve tried everything from Dior and Chantecaille to L’Oreal and Maybelline. Despite paying over $80 for some mascaras, my top choice before this was a $5 from Essence. This Grande one beats everything! As much volume as Diorshow, with the definition of Definicils, and the length of...I don’t know I’ve never had such great length! Now, I do use a lash primer with it, but I’ve had almost as good results without it. I prefer Marc Jacobs’s beige color primer (forgot the name). One swipe looks very natural, but definitely more volume and definition. Two coats, and it is the almost false lash look of my dreams! So so glad I gave this one a chance!"

I do 2-3 coats NO MATTER the mascara and I normally curl my lashes. This doesn't transfer, it's buildable, it has length AND volume, it's DARK, and you can go for a va-va-voom look if you wish by doing several coats. The first few times wearing these people asked me if I had eye-lash extensions! I mean, it doesn't get better than that in my opinion. I'm going to post a more in-depth review on my blog linareviews.com so if you'd like to check it out please do, but honestly, I need to buy five of these-- it's SO GOOD!"

It reminds me of Better Than Sex, but I find it doesn’t leave my lashes looking dry or flaky after a long day like BTS sometimes can...Maybe because of the castor oil GrandeDRAMA.  I use their lash serum every day and paired with this mascara, I couldn't imagine going back to falsies. It comes off super easy too with a balm-based makeup remover (Farmacy's Green Clean is my fav!).  If you want out of this world extreme lashes, use their GrandePRIMER with this and your lashes will be next level. I learned it works best if you apply mascara immediately after primer - don't let it dry, I do one eye at a time! I seriously could not recommend Grande Cosmetics' lash products enough."
