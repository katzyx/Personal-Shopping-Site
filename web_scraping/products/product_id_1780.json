I can see this being fantastic for summertime, but for the dry colder months itu2019s dried me out and also has broke me out just slightly. But we canu2019t reasonably expect a full coverage all day perfecting foundation to not dry us out! At the beginning to the end of 12 hours, my makeup looked so good!! Oils came through a tiny bit after 6 hours of wear, not bad at all. I used primer and a luminous powder. This reminds me of estee lauder double wear but less matte/flat. I do enjoy it for when I need that perfect complexion and for my makeup to LAST. However I find the price point to be a miss with how much product there is. Iu2019m excited to try it in the summer time during those insanely humid days, I think itu2019ll be great. I have combo skin and double moisturized underneath this (esp with it being winter) as well. I do recommend trying it! I just prefer it cosmetics cc foundation for these cold months."

I thought I would be a light color in this foundation, but Fair 50 NG ended up being the closest match. A couple of the light shades were actually lighter than Fair 50, which was the best match for my skin tone although it was a bit too light. The foundation has enough coverage. My oily t-zone was still oily after a few hours and my dry areas looked dry. All of that might have been ok; however, the foundation made me break out. I wore it a few times, days to a week apart, and broke out each time. I now have two scars from that and canu2019t wear this again. This was unfortunate and surprising since foundations my skin doesnu2019t usually react this way. It may work well for others."

No matter what I did, what primer I used, what application/tool I used, the results were still the same.  This foundation immediately began to cling to any imperfection.  When I tried to smooth it would with a brush or beauty blender, it just completely left my face in that spot.  When I finally got the result decent enough, I wore it to work.  Throughout the day, it was pilling and separating and clinging to dry spots.  It completely settled in the pores in my nose area and did not dry down.  I couldn't touch anything to my face.

Iu2019m loving the finish with One Size, I build it to medium coverage and glad I decided to go with a foundation with a semi matte finish. Because I prep my skin well and I also apply with a damp beauty sponge, this doesnu2019t accentuate dry patches, fine lines and I do find it blurring which is great being that Iu2019m in my late 30s. I also enjoy the fact that there isnu2019t a bunch of unnecessary (in my opinion) skincare ingredients in the foundation, I already have a good skincare routine so I donu2019t need extra ingredients in my makeup. Thank you for not adding Niacinamide to this lol because I feel like itu2019s in everything under the sun these days, anyways itu2019s a great product and I will definitely re purchase."

For starters, the colors are so off, especially for the medium-dark category. I wear Dark Deep 15 GO and even though the value of the color u201cmatchesu201d my skin, the olive undertone doesnu2019t. Love that an olive undertone was included because most brands donu2019t even offer one, but then if I go one shade up Iu2019d be wearing Patricku2019s color (Iu2019m nowhere near his skin color?!) and then one darker would be entirely too deep for me, so that sucks.   Second, this claims to be a soft matte finishu2026Iu2019m combo with an oily t-zone and even if I let the foundation sit itu2019s never quite matte. It looks very skin like to me and has a natural finish, which is very pretty but again, not matte. My Fenty Matte foundation is a true soft matte and this finish is nowhere near that.   I do love that it has a smaller list of ingredients. My sensitive skin doesnu2019t break out from it which is great! And it does last a verryyyy long time.  Overall, the foundation is nice but the color range and the finish makes it so that I have to work a bit harder to make it work for me. I recommend this for true, normal skin types or as a winter foundation for oily girls."

I ordered two shades because I wanted to see which one matched me better but unfortunately neither of them were a good match. I went back to the store and swatched more shades but still no good matches. I usually have a easy time finding a shade but I found the shades in the deep dark category to be either too light (15 and 25), too red (35) and too dark (45 and deepest 15). I am really bummed because I found the formula to be nice, light weight and full coverage but I canu2019t get over the shade. Iu2019ve even tried mixing in blue color corrector but still no luck. For reference I have a neutral olive undertone and my shade matches are Haus labs 490, Fenty 445, Nars new Caledonia and Armani 13.25. If one size could add more neutral (maybe even olive) shades to the dark deep category Iu2019ll definitely try those shades and would probably have a good match."

I got a few days of more than 5 hours of wear and it hung on. It went on easily, blended out well, and did give the coverage I desired for a semi natural, not overdone finish. It took well to various setting sprays and settled in nicely with my setting powders without changing. Overall, I really love this foundation and pleased for being new on the market."
