I can see this being fantastic for summertime, but for the dry colder months it’s dried me out and also has broke me out just slightly. But we can’t reasonably expect a full coverage all day perfecting foundation to not dry us out! At the beginning to the end of 12 hours, my makeup looked so good!! Oils came through a tiny bit after 6 hours of wear, not bad at all. I used primer and a luminous powder. This reminds me of estee lauder double wear but less matte/flat. I do enjoy it for when I need that perfect complexion and for my makeup to LAST. However I find the price point to be a miss with how much product there is. I’m excited to try it in the summer time during those insanely humid days, I think it’ll be great. I have combo skin and double moisturized underneath this (esp with it being winter) as well. I do recommend trying it! I just prefer it cosmetics cc foundation for these cold months."

I thought I would be a light color in this foundation, but Fair 50 NG ended up being the closest match. A couple of the light shades were actually lighter than Fair 50, which was the best match for my skin tone although it was a bit too light. The foundation has enough coverage. My oily t-zone was still oily after a few hours and my dry areas looked dry. All of that might have been ok; however, the foundation made me break out. I wore it a few times, days to a week apart, and broke out each time. I now have two scars from that and can’t wear this again. This was unfortunate and surprising since foundations my skin doesn’t usually react this way. It may work well for others."

I loved how the KVD was *actually* full coverage (unlike a lot of foundations that claim to be), it looked gorgeous on the skin, it lasted beautifully… It was pretty perfect for my wants and preferences, and I was genuinely upset when they discontinued it lol.  You guys, this is the closest I’ve found. If you’re a full coverage, obvious-makeup-wearing girly, this is so good!! *Actually* full coverage, beautiful soft matte finish, blurring on the skin, lasts throughout the day… Of course, it is a full coverage foundation, so it’s not going to be weightless or invisible on the skin. That being said, I do think it does a fantastic job sitting nicely on the skin for a foundation of it’s coverage level.  I finallyyyyy feel like I can have my old full beat makeup style back and I’m so happy about it 🥲 If you, like me, were crushed when they discontinued Lock-It, give this one a try! I think you’ll love it.  One note: the shades run very golden. I had to buy a rosy shade (I’m usually neutral) because everything else looked superrrrr golden/warm on me."

I returned it and didn't look at the shade I exchanged it for, Fair 30 N.  It was the consistency that it was supposed to be.  I was excited until I tried it on.  No matter what I did, what primer I used, what application/tool I used, the results were still the same.  This foundation immediately began to cling to any imperfection.  When I tried to smooth it would with a brush or beauty blender, it just completely left my face in that spot.  When I finally got the result decent enough, I wore it to work.  Throughout the day, it was pilling and separating and clinging to dry spots.  It completely settled in the pores in my nose area and did not dry down.  I couldn't touch anything to my face.  By the end of the day, it looked like I took a makeup wipe and did a terrible job of wiping my face.  I returned it."

I’m loving the finish with One Size, I build it to medium coverage and glad I decided to go with a foundation with a semi matte finish. Because I prep my skin well and I also apply with a damp beauty sponge, this doesn’t accentuate dry patches, fine lines and I do find it blurring which is great being that I’m in my late 30s. I also enjoy the fact that there isn’t a bunch of unnecessary (in my opinion) skincare ingredients in the foundation, I already have a good skincare routine so I don’t need extra ingredients in my makeup. Thank you for not adding Niacinamide to this lol because I feel like it’s in everything under the sun these days, anyways it’s a great product and I will definitely re purchase."

I wear Dark Deep 15 GO and even though the value of the color “matches” my skin, the olive undertone doesn’t. Love that an olive undertone was included because most brands don’t even offer one, but then if I go one shade up I’d be wearing Patrick’s color (I’m nowhere near his skin color?!) and then one darker would be entirely too deep for me, so that sucks.   Second, this claims to be a soft matte finish…I’m combo with an oily t-zone and even if I let the foundation sit it’s never quite matte. It looks very skin like to me and has a natural finish, which is very pretty but again, not matte. My Fenty Matte foundation is a true soft matte and this finish is nowhere near that.   I do love that it has a smaller list of ingredients. My sensitive skin doesn’t break out from it which is great! And it does last a verryyyy long time.  Overall, the foundation is nice but the color range and the finish makes it so that I have to work a bit harder to make it work for me. I recommend this for true, normal skin types or as a winter foundation for oily girls."

			"review_text": "I’ve been using this foundation for about 2 weeks now, and I really love it! I was expecting it to possibly feel heavy on my skin since it’s supposed to be very full coverage. However, it actually feels really lightweight! You only need a little bit of the foundation because it goes a long way. It applied beautifully on my skin, and I love the soft matte finish. It also lasted all day on my skin. The packaging is so cute as well! This is definitely a new staple foundation for me."

			"review_text": "When one size first announced that they were dropping a foundation I was super excited and had my cart ready. A few influencers that I follow who are shade twins with me were also struggling to find a good shade or would have to mix 2 shades together. I ordered two shades because I wanted to see which one matched me better but unfortunately neither of them were a good match. I went back to the store and swatched more shades but still no good matches. I usually have a easy time finding a shade but I found the shades in the deep dark category to be either too light (15 and 25), too red (35) and too dark (45 and deepest 15). I am really bummed because I found the formula to be nice, light weight and full coverage but I can’t get over the shade. I’ve even tried mixing in blue color corrector but still no luck. For reference I have a neutral olive undertone and my shade matches are Haus labs 490, Fenty 445, Nars new Caledonia and Armani 13.25. If one size could add more neutral (maybe even olive) shades to the dark deep category I’ll definitely try those shades and would probably have a good match."
