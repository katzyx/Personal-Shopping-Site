			"review_text": "I love Tower 28 but this product was horrendous -it was grainy and sticky from the first use. It also gave me a mild allergic reaction, as my lower face would itch and breakout whenever I used this. Another word to the wise; using reward points to take money off is the worst way to use your points, I used my 500 points to take $10 off and I didn't receive them back after I returned this product despite it being so disappointing and giving me a reaction, so I only got $5 back from a product I hated, which wad frustrating since it took so long to build up my points. I reached out and was told Sephora won't return your points unless you used them on an order that was lost in transit. I would recommend instead using them to pick something out from the rewards bazar instead or take money off a product you already know and love. Kind of disappointed in Sephora tbh, I feel like they could do better than how they handled this situation."
