			"review_text": "I had the chance to try Clarins Double Serum 9, and even though it came in a sample size of three 0.03 fl oz ampules, I got a glimpse of its potential. This 2-in-1 formula, powered by 22 plant extracts and 5 new pure active molecules, feels like a concentrated blend of nature’s finest. From the first application, I noticed the texture was luxuriously silky and absorbed effortlessly into my skin without any greasy residue. The light, botanical scent was refreshing and soothing, making it an enjoyable part of my skincare routine.  The packaging of the ampules is sleek and efficient—perfect for travel or trial use. The dual-chamber design ensures a balanced mix of serum with each pump, showcasing the thoughtfulness behind its development. Even though I used it three times a week, the hydration and smoothness it left behind were noticeable. However, the sample size didn’t quite allow me to experience the full anti-aging benefits that Clarins promises. I can tell, though, that with more regular use, it could definitely address lifestyle-induced aging.  What really stood out was the inclusion of Clarins Eye Lift. After using it for a longer period, I saw a visible improvement in the firmness around my eyes within a week. It was an added bonus that made me appreciate Clarins' commitment to delivering results.  While I’m giving it four stars due to the limited sample size, I’m genuinely impressed with the formula, ingredients, and luxurious feel of Double Serum 9. It’s worth considering if you’re serious about tackling the signs of aging."

I love combining this product with the Cryo-Flash Instant Lift Mask, it adds more lift and glow.  The smell is a bit much, but fades away quickly. My skin (which is always sensitive) has only improved in making my pores nice and small, with no breakouts, my skin is less dull, and my skin (normally a desert) has regained its moisture.  Price-wise, expensive, but it is worth buying. The product has lasted me for over two months and it isn't even halfway through. I like the function of being able to choose a smaller pump amount, which helps make the product last longer.  The only flaw I find is the pump itself. When it squirts out the product, it can go flying in all directions, even with a hand underneath. It's so forceful like it's trying to extract a thicker product when the actual product is liquid. The pump needs to be a bit smoother for a liquid product."

However, the double serum light has been a great addition to my routine and I know I will use it year round!  For winter I layer it with other hydrating products and it gives such a boost to my skin texture and appearance.  I would imagine during summer I could get away with the double serum light over vitamin c serum and under a hydrating spf and that would be plenty for me.  The only complaint I have is the packaging.  The pump causes the serum to spray out too fast/hard which causes it to splatter every time."

It’s very light but still has a slight oil feel but it sinks into the skin quickly and doesn’t leave a greasy residue. It’s very hydrating for how light it is. My skin was starting to get dry with the colder weather and this has made it a lot softer. It does seem to give my skin some radiance and smooths it but I haven’t been using it long enough to really speak on long term benefits. The smell is ok, it’s not my favorite but it’s not unpleasant. My only complaint with this product is the packaging. For $130 serum I feel the packaging should be glass instead of plastic. The pump is not very good either, it’s not smooth and can squirt out too much. The product itself is a great serum I just feel the packaging should better match the price point."

I love both of those products and for my middle-age skin that tends to be on the dry side, they are a perfect balance between oil and water. However, I tend to avoid them during the summer months when I sweat a lot. This is the perfect solution. It’s definitely more lightweight than the original, double serum, and thinner. For me this means I need two full pumps of it to cover my face and neck well, but someone with less dry skin would need less. It sinks in really quickly and doesn’t leave any residue for me, but it does leave a slight suppleness to the skin and what feels like a thin protective layer, over which make up applies very smoothly and evenly. I don’t like the smell as much as I do of the original double serum. Currently I use this in the morning and the original double serum at night and my skin has never looked better."

I applied the serum at night after cleansing without additional products to avoid any reaction. Once the serum was in my palm, I was surprised at the consistency. But in a good way! I expected a heavy oil, not sure why when the name of the product contains the words light texture. It looked like watery oil if oil could be watered down :) I also noticed the serum's scent right away. I found it quite light and pleasant. If you are sensitive to scents though, you will notice it. It wasn't overwhelming and flowery but more like a feminine clean, woodsy scent. The serum was light on my skin, and it was quickly absorbed in just a few minutes leaving my face feeling slightly dewy but not tacky or sticky. The next morning, I woke up with skin that looked lovely and not like an oil slick! I only had to splash my face with water and for the rest of the day, my skin felt and looked super nice. I continued doing my simplified skincare routine of only using a gentle face wash in the evening followed by the serum and sunscreen if needed. By the end of the week, I hadn't experienced any irritation, redness, or breakouts. I enjoyed the way the serum felt on my skin, and I felt that my face did have a little glow when it was applied. Although that could have been from the turmeric. Haha! Overall, I hadn't noticed any significant change in my skin, but it wasn't in bad shape and given that the skin turnover rate is every 4-6 weeks that would be the ideal amount of time to see if there was a subtle improvement. *I'm not a dermatologist though so don't that as a scientific fact :) I will purchase this serum because I loved the feel of it on my skin, my skin looked healthy and hydrated/ I'm happy I had the opportunity to try the serum as a #freeproduct from #trywithtopbox so that I could pass on my honest (and lengthy) review!"

The product claims to boost the 5 vital functions of the skin - regeneration, nutrition, oxygenation, hydration, protection - and acts on signs of aging.   I tried this serum for 7 straight days, both day and night as the sample provided. Within the first application I could already see my skin looked smoother. After the full 7 days I noticed my skin looked more luminous and felt firmer. As for smoothing wrinkles, I think I would probably have to use the product much longer to see a result.

This is very much a luxury serum with a matching price tag and while my review on the original version said the cost was a hard sell for me, this updated light version has earned a spot on my wishlist.  I noticed a small difference in smoothness and plumpness, even only using this for a week in the morning. The fragrance is a super faint floral, especially once the serum dries down. But my favourite part about this serum is definitely the texture.  I remember the original not necessarily feeling greasy but definitely heavier than I’d prefer for an AM routine. However, the light texture version works great in both routines. It feels oily when you first mix the two serums but as you rub it in, it melts beautifully and dries down without a hint of residue. I love the effect it gives my skin and how it leaves it impossibly smooth.

The product targets Fine Lines and Wrinkles, Dullness, and Loss of Firmness and Elasticity. I felt like this product made my skin more firm and elastic. I don't think it helped with dullness. I would use this again the summer when it is hotter and my skin is more oily. However, I do think the formula could be refined and I would re-purchase if it was."

Its double hydrolipidic formula consists of 21 potent plant extracts that work with the natural functioning of your skin and boost the skin’s 5 vital functions: regeneration, nutrition, oxygenation, hydration, and protection. The serum comes in a really cool eco-designed bottle containing two separate vials. In one there is a non-greasy oil, the other a melting gel. I love how easy it is to get the perfect amount you need. Very easy to apply. It’s a little wet, but not greasy at all. I’m not sure if it’s just my imagination, but I swear that the draining step makes my face just a little bit less puffy. It didn’t absorb instantly, but it was perfect when I was done draining. My skin was very smooth and soft, and I'm pretty sure the lines under my eyes faded ever so slightly. Regardless, my face looked brighter and refreshed which makes me very happy. I am very thankful to have been given the opportunity to test this #freeproduct from TopBox Circle."

However, I do believe that with extended use, this product has the potential to work wonders for all skin types. It's definitely worth considering for those seeking a hydrating and revitalizing skincare solution."

The pores on my nose and chin seemed to decrease in size and I had more of a, dare I say, youthful glow to my skin.

I think the key to good results is pressing it into your skin and not spreading it on your face.  As for results, my skin looked hydrated and my pores looked smaller.  Bonus, it helped with eczema I had on the palm of my hand.  It’s pricey but if you can afford it, I recommend this serum. #freeproduct"

I found it took a while for the serum to absorb into my skin if I didn't warm up the product. I also think it would be better for dry skin types because I have combination skin and sometimes it'll be oil and the product would be too oily on me.

Ive been using several Clarins products regularly over of the years with success and it’s one of my favourite brands. There is always some hesitation on my part when trying new products because of my skin being prone to breakouts. Happily, I can report that after using this serum at night for several weeks, I did not breakout and in fact my skin looks and feels healthier. It has evened out my skin tone, eliminating redness and even noticeably reducing pore size. It has a nice, light consistency that is not too thin or too thick, making for easy application.  Absorption is quick and it instantly soothes, feeling great on the skin. I enjoy the fragrance which is light and not at all overpowering. Sometimes a fragrance can trigger my allergies but not so with this serum. My only issue was that when applied at night before bedtime, after cleansing, I would wake up and notice a bit of a sheen to my face, but no irritation or breakouts and no oil control issues during the day. Cleansing removed any sheen. The overall results of Clarins Double Serum have been great and even at its full-size price point, and since a little goes a long way, I will purchase this serum and add it to my daily routine."

The Light Texture serum was even easier to apply on my face and still made my skin look dewy. I did not experience any negative reactions to the product with my combination skin.

I received a 7-day sample sachet pouch, and after the week of use I noticed just as good of an effect as I did with their original serum. To be honest I did not notice much of a difference in the texture, really. The serum absorbs into the skin very well with only a very fine residue. The sachet is composed of two separate formulas, a non-greasy oil and a melting gel, from two different vials that you mix together. The scent is fragrant but not overpowering. I still have that ‘lit from within’ radiant glow. I apply it overnight while I sleep - my skin wakes up feeling very soft and smooth and my complexion looks brighter. My mum tried one as well, and she liked it just as much as the original. You really can’t go wrong with any variation of the Double Serum, it is one of the best products on the market.

Seriously, it’s the holy grail!   🧡The packets have two separate compartments that you mix together. You then apply the product onto your face. I love this concept as it helps to keep the ingredients more potent!  🍯 The two serums are thin in consistency. One has a rich gold colour and the other is clear. When mixed together, it almost looks like honey in your hands. The texture of the serum is a bit oily at first. But, it absorbs into the skin quickly and doesn’t leave you with a greasy feeling!  🌺I personally liked to apply this product in both my morning and evening routine. Its dual texture leaves an immediate barely there finish and a pleasant fragrance with fruity, floral, fresh and refined notes  that is not too overpowering. If you aren’t a big fan of the scent, don’t worry, it dissipates quickly.  ✨ I noticed immediate results with this serum. It's incredibly hydrating and left my skin with a nice glow. After only a few days of use, I have noticed a dramatic shrinkage in my larger pores and a much smoother skin texture. This stuff is seriously amazing. I am absolutely blown away and loving the results! ✨   ✅I have combination/acne prone skin and for me it didn't cause any break outs or irritation. I definitely recommend this product to everyone and will definitely be purchasing a full-sized bottle of this serum! #freeproduct #topboxcircle"

As predicted, this serum did not do anything remarkable for my skin. However, it is a good basic serum that combines hydration (water) and moisture (oil), and will provide a lightweight glow to your face. As an aside, I prefer unscented skincare products and this one is scented. For the price, you can find other alternatives that have more powerful ingredients and are more cost effective."

I have oily skin, and there's something in this product that not only makes my pores look massive but also clogs my pores to cause breakouts/irritation. Because of that, I would recommend this product to anyone with acne-prone skin. I also found the fragrance to be a strong floral scent, which may be a problem for people with sensitive skin. I found that the serum absorbed into my skin well and didn't feel heavy at all. Because I couldn't use the product consecutively, and considering it was a 7-day trial, there's no way for me to determine whether or not it's effective with fine lines.  Overall, this product is a no-go for me. I don't want to swap fine lines with pimples.  #freeproduct"

It layered well with a night cream and did not cause any eye irritation. I perceived that it helped with skin smoothing in terms of bumps and redness over the week I tested it, it did not cause any issues with acne.

I have only used it at night cause it is a only a few sachets so I’m not sure how it layers under makeup but I would absolutely recommend to anyone that can afford the luxury of this product.

First and foremost, the light texture of this serum is a winner. It feels incredibly silky and smooth on the skin, and it absorbs quickly without any residue. This made it an absolute joy to use, especially under makeup during the day.  The scent of the serum is delightful - it's subtle and adds a spa-like experience to my skincare routine. It's not overpowering, which I appreciate.  Now, let's talk about the results. Over time, I noticed a significant improvement in the overall health and appearance of my skin. My complexion looked more radiant and felt incredibly soft to the touch. Fine lines seemed to be less noticeable, and my skin felt hydrated throughout the day.  What sets this serum apart is its dual-phase formula, combining both water-soluble and oil-soluble ingredients. This comprehensive approach seems to address various skin concerns effectively. It's like giving your skin a dose of nourishment and hydration all in one.  Would I buy this product? Absolutely. While it may be on the higher end in terms of price, the Clarins Double Serum Light Texture is worth the investment for the visible results it delivers.  Would I recommend it to friends and family? Without a doubt. If you're looking for a serum that offers a luxurious experience while delivering fantastic results, this is the one. It suits a wide range of skin types and concerns, making it a versatile addition to any skincare routine. Clarins has truly nailed it with this product."

It's like a gossamer veil of hydration and comfort on my skin. There’s a slight yellow tint to it (thanks to the turmeric), so it might not be the best choice to wear under makeup, unless you like this effect. It’s subtly, almost undetectably scented and a little sticky when you first apply it, but it quickly melts into skin. My complexion is instantly glowy and plumped up. LOVE!"

Gently warming the serum in my palms activated it and I patted my face and neck to apply. It soaked in quickly and did not leave a greasy 'film' as some do, and accepted my light moisturizer afterward with no weird mixing or flaking on my skin. There was no residue either and my skin genuinely enjoyed this product. My skin glowed and did not look oily or shiny (you know that shine I mean!) I wholeheartedly endorse this serum.

It has a pleasant floral-fruity which I like, but not sure for people that are sensitive with scent. The serum claims to improve signs of aging such as wrinkles, radiance and pore size. I use this serum every morning and night, after cleansing and toning my skin. With the short time of the trial, I can not really tell it helps anything with wrinkles, but I do feel my skin is more hydration.

But I am enjoying the nicer texture, more firmness and more of a general glow. I am in my early 40s, and serums are necessary. This one is really quite nice."

It leaves my skin hydrated, plump and glowy. This light texture version has a similar appearance and fragrance but the texture is noticeably different. It is less viscous and glides on smoother making spreading across the skin easier. It also seems to absorb into my skin faster. However it doesn’t feel as hydrating as the original version. As someone in their 50s with maturing skin I prefer the OG for my face but might pick this up for my neck and décolletage due to the ease of application on a larger surface area of skin. This light texture version might also be good for younger skin or for those who want a lighter version of the original."

After an application, my skin both looks and feels more hydrated. The Light Texture serum is easy to mix in your palm, goes on super smooth and soaks into my skin better than the OG serum. I liked that it left my skin looking fresh. I had a literal glow!

It's perfect for those who prefer a lighter serum that doesn't weigh down the skin. I've noticed a significant improvement in my skin's overall texture and radiance since incorporating this serum into my daily routine. It seems to have a brightening effect, and my fine lines appear less noticeable. Plus, the fact that it's packed with natural plant extracts is a big win for me, as I prefer products with clean and effective ingredients. The Double Serum Light Texture has become a staple in my skincare regimen, and I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a lightweight yet potent anti-aging serum. It's a small investment that delivers impressive results for a more youthful and radiant complexion."

This wonder ingredient was tumeric. Tumeric has many benefits for your skin.   Now, I was only provided a weeks worth of serum, so it’s hard to judge any long term effects but the short time benefits were very nice. My skin felt very moisturized and the skin tone was nice and even.   One of the strengths of Clarins serums is their ability to address various skincare issues, including hydration, anti-aging, brightening and much more    Clarins serums are often praised for their lightweight and easily absorbable textures, making them suitable for various skin types, including sensitive skin.

I tried it for a short period of time (Sample) so the results are not optimal in my opinion. Impossible to see a real difference in the short term. Also, the format received did not highlight the product and was difficult to use. Anyway, the product is soft and leaves a comfortable and pleasant effect on the skin. It's not greasy for the skin and is rather light to wear during the day. The perfume it leaves on the skin is not unpleasant, but could bother some people. Having sensitive skin, I also would have preferred a less strong smell. Nevertheless, this product fits easily into a daily routine (especially if it is adopted in another format). It definitely deserves a try!"

I was planning on using double serum at night time, but the way my skin felt after application, I decided to use it the next morning as well, as my only skincare step. My skin feels hydrated all day long and has a beautiful soft glow when I apply the serum under my makeup. I only use a small dime sized amount, as it seems pretty concentrated. My sensitive skin was not irritated at all, even with the soft, clean fragrance inside. I can't say enough great things about the light texture version of Clairns double serum. Hands down one of my favorite skincare products of all time. Luckily, I was chosen to try a seven day sample as a free product and will definitely be purchasing  in the very near future."

Each sachet contains two separate serums, one light colored and the other turmeric yellow.  I pressed the middle and squeezed both serums into my palm.  I mixed it and applied it to my skin and massaged it lightly.  This routine, which I applied in the morning and evening, made my skin bright and glowy.  It got easily absorbed by my skin.  It didn't leave a greasy feeling and kept hydrating all day long.

It evened out my skin tone (after continuous use) and works great during the day too, because it’s not oily. I found when I use it during the day, my makeup applies better, lasts longer and I need less. Try this! Trust me. You will love it ♥️ Just a quick side note: I did receive this as a #freeproduct trial from #topbox, but I promise you that my review has nothing to do with that. This is truly an amazing serum."

The new lightweight texture is ideal for oily skin and those living in warm or humid climates. 💛  Living in Tennessee it gets pretty warm and humid, and this serum has been wonderful! Not only is it addressing my anti-aging needs, but it is super lightweight and perfect for all the rainy, humid weather we have been having! I have severely dry, dull, aging skin and this serum is literally transforming my skin. My skin is appearing more radiant, it’s super smooth and hydrated, my fine lines are less apparent and my skin is appearing firmer. 💛  I really love how easily this absorbs into my skin, with zero stickiness or oiliness. I am shocked, I would have imagined this serum to leave my skin feeling oily, but it doesn’t. It has a light fragrance that I don’t mind, it actually smells delicious. It contains amazing ingredients like Turmeric, Mango, Kiwi, Beauty Berry, Oat, Cocoa, Banana and Quinoa. I love the way my skin feels and looks from adding this Clarins Double Serum in the new light texture into my daily routine. This is definitely a serum I would love to always have in hand! 💛"

If you have combo or oily non-sensitive skin and do not mind spending a bit of money for an experience then definitely give this a try but unfortunately, I am not 100% sold on it."

When I saw there was a light option I knew I needed to try it. I have normal/combo skin with dullness, texture, fine lines and enlarged pores. After trying this one I can say it's definitely the way to go for my skin type. It has a similar texture to the original but feels so much lighter on my skin. Rather than a cream in the mix this one has another very thin fluid that mixes very easily and sinks into my skin quickly. I didn't experience any breakouts with this one and I feel it's made my skin look more radiant. I had a bit of crepe-y skin under my eyes that has started to smooth out and my texture has improved as well. If you have finicky skin and need a lighter serum this is the way to go! I also love that you can dial in exactly how much you want it to dispense so that you're never getting too much or too little."

I like that I can adjust how much product comes out in one pump (there are 2 settings- I’ve found the larger amount is just right for my face and neck). I really like this serum; it’s very light, not greasy feeling, and just enough oil to act as my moisturizer in warm weather. During winter I would probably need additional moisture. It leaves me glowing and feeling like I don’t need makeup. I feel like it has also reduced some fine lines and smoothed out my skin. It feels really nice on, absorbs quickly, and has been a great addition to my skincare. My hair is up in the before picture; same time of day, same room, same lighting, and no makeup at all.

The serum itself applied very evenly and absorbed beautifully into my skin. I love the products packaging because it allows you to dispense the exact amount of product that you need. Overall, this serum was very gentle on my skin, and I could tell that the moisture in my skin was greatly improved. The next morning, my skin looks absolutely radiant! And I love how I’m able to use this in both the morning and the night. Overall, I am very impressed with this serum, and I will continue to use it daily. Gifted by Clarins"

As someone who lives in a warm climate, I think this serum is going to really be amazing during Summer.  It has everything I love about the original formula, and it’s lighter texture absorbs even easier into my skin while still providing a healthy hydrated glow.  It also has the same adjustable dial so I never over use and waste any product.  I will start rotating between the traditional and Light formulations as I think this one is a better consistency for my skin in the warmer months, but you really can’t go wrong with either formula."

			"review_text": "Clarins' Double Serum has been around seemingly forever and has become a crowd favorite over the years. It's definitely one of the brand's most popular - if not THE most popular - product in their line. By and large, dermatologists seem to agree that it's a nice formula but nothing terribly out of the ordinary or necessarily unique but loyal fans staunchly stand by the fact that the Double Serum is practically a miracle worker for their skin. I tried the original version years ago and enjoyed it but didn't find that it had any notable long-term effects that made me feel the need to repurchase it.  This serum (which was gifted by the brand) is the lighter weight sister of the original version but I think that it feels every bit as delightful as what I tried years ago. I honestly do really enjoy how it feels on my skin and it absolutely provides the hydration that my dry skin appreciates. The packaging feels luxe and the product itself is conveniently dispensed through a pump top. The serum feels substantial without being cloyingly heavy and it somehow sinks into the skin but yet manages to still create almost a pillowy veil of moisture over the skin's surface. Clearly I really do like using this. However, despite all of its good qualities I still don't see any kind of lasting, long-term, anti-aging benefits from using this. The results, though delightful, are temporary and for the high price tag it may not be worth it to a lot of people.  Would I purchase it at a discounted price or during a sale? Possibly. However, for my myself I don't think I could justify purchasing it at its full retail value."
