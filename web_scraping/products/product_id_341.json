			"review_text": "I have thicker, wavy textured hair (2b, 2c). It’s also very long. I think this would be better suited for finer hair. It felt nice while in the shower, but it just didn’t give the conditioning my thicker hair really needs. Left my hair dry. It was lightweight though, left no residue. The smell is also a bit strong. Smells like laundry, which isn’t exactly what I want my hair to smell like."
