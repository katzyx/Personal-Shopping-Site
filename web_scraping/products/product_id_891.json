I have been using eyeliner for the last 20 years of my life and every time i was using this, a small piece was breaking. I may have used it in total about 5-6 times. The staying power is mediocre and so is the pigmentation (much darker than in the photo); multiple re-applications were needed within a short period of time. Unfortunately, or perhaps fortunately, cheaper eyeliners will yield better results."

			"review_text": "K guys, hear me out ! I purchased this from Kosas because Sephora was out of the Bewitched shade. I also purchased Hypnotize (matte black). I'm really glad I did and here are a few reasons why: 1. ) I went to Sephora to swatch these and compared them to MUF & UD. The MUF ones literally would not come off my hand and the Kosas ones did once I used m/u remover. I am not someone who wants to sleep in my eyeliner so took this to be a good sign.  2.) I have oily skin - lt's combo for part of the month and oily oily for the second half. I WAS ABLE TO USE THIS WITHOUT AN EYESHADOW UNDER IT. That means it did not transfer to my upper lids throughout a normal 8 hour work day. This is true for both colors. It also of course works with a powder eyeshadow. I was impressed by the long-wearing feature and I'm assuming that's why this product leans a bit dry.  3.) This is not that squishy gooey style of eyeliner that will work in your water line aka kohl. It works on the lash line and the matte formula is smoother so will work for some people's waterline. The satin formula not so much, which I think is completely fine if you're not using it for that. I don't think that makes it a bad product. It's a 'clean' make up item which means there are going to be variations in formula and capability.  4.) I think the colors are super unique. I compared them to MUF and UD in-store and found them to be original and flattering.  Overall I absolutely think this eyeliner is worth purchasing, if you get one that is crumbly or breaks its probably a bad batch. I ordered mine direct from Kosas and did not have this issue.  Source- Mid 30's, make up nerd, I don't watch tik-tok."

Application of this tugs on the skin because it is a dry product — no smooth application at all. I just bought mine in late October/early November 2024, so it has not even lasted 2 months. This is just garbage. You would probably have better quality and luck from a drugstore cosmetic aisle eyeliner."

I was skeptical and a little wary of putting something in my eyes that doesn't have preservatives, I didn't want bacteria build up to give me a stye- which I guess it still could but 3 weeks in, it's not an issue. The pencil comes with a sharpener and smudger which are actually quite functional. The lasting power is great, and I enjoy the finish. It's easy to work with, it sets but you have play time to clean it up. I use on top and bottom water line"

I sampled Kosas Soul Gazer Intensifying Gel Eyeliner in the shade ‘Gravitate’ and overall, I really enjoyed the product. The formula is excellent—it goes on super smooth and easy, and it dries within seconds, which I love. It's also smudgeable, but you have to work quickly before it sets. Removing it at the end of the day was effortless; it came right off with my nightly makeup remover cloth.  The color is vibrant, though ‘Gravitate’ wasn’t quite what I expected. It was described as a 'creamy beige matte,' but for some reason, I imagined more of a taupe shade. That said, it’s still a beautiful color that works perfectly for brightening the inner corners of my eyes. It can also be used on the upper lids if you're looking for a bright, eye-opening effect.  I appreciate that this formulation is vegan and hypoallergenic. One thing I didn’t expect—but absolutely loved—was the rubber grip towards the end of the pencil. It made the application feel really comfortable and secure in my hand. It's a small detail, but it really adds to the experience!"

I can report that this product does not disappoint! The packaging is a beautiful lavender color with simple print that is easy to read. The product applied so smoothly, and I was able to achieve a nice solid line with one pass. It did not smear, smudge, or flake with all-day wear, and removal was very easy. The no-smudge formula would make this perfect for creating wings; however, there is no way to sharpen the tip. The built-in smudger is a nice addition for creating a smokey eye, but you have to work fast as the formula sets very quickly. A bit of the tip did break off during my second use, without having too much dispensed or using a heavy hand, which is a little disappointing, but I will say this eyeliner is better than 95% of the liquid or pencil liners I have used. I definitely recommend this product and will be repurchasing, perhaps in a few shades."

The color (I got Cosmic - Blue) is vibrant and beautiful. I got compliments for matching my makeup to the band T-shirt I wore to a recent concert. And I think it's really cute that the gel pencil itself is a color other than black. Helps it stick out in my makeup bag! The liner lasts pretty well, except it does smear a little bit on my eyelids as I blink throughout the day. I encounter that problem often, but there ARE eyeliners that don't give me that issue, so I was hoping this would be one of them. Even so, it's easy to rub right off what's not supposed to be there. Overall, a positive experience and I would recommend it for a pop of color if you're not trying to do a whole look."

The pigmentation was very lacking- I’ve gotten bolder pigmentation from much cheaper products.   It does not apply well to the waterline- where I typically apply eyeliner. It shows better on the eyelid, but still not the pigmentation I was expecting.   This is my first product from this brand, and I’m not sure if I would be tempted to try other products from them.

Once applied, it sets quickly to a waterproof finish that stays put for hours. The shade is intensely pigmented with a deep, matte finish that instantly enhances my eyes. The gel comes in a pot with a well-designed brush that makes application precise and effortless. The brush itself is firm enough to create sharp lines yet soft enough to blend or smudge if desired.

As someone with aging skin, finding an eyeliner that glides on effortlessly and helps me achieve a natural everyday look has been a challenge. However, this gel eyeliner has exceeded my expectations.  The formula is incredibly smooth and creamy, allowing it to effortlessly glide on my eyelids without any tugging or pulling. This makes the application process much easier and more enjoyable. The pigmentation is also impressive, providing a rich and intense color payoff that lasts throughout the day.  What I appreciate the most about this eyeliner is its ability to enhance my eyes while still looking natural. The gel formula allows me to create precise lines that define my eyes without looking too harsh or overdone. It effortlessly blends with my eyeshadow and complements my overall makeup look.  Additionally, the Soul Gazer Intensifying Gel Eyeliner is long-lasting and does not smudge or fade throughout the day. It stays put, even on my aging skin, which tends to be more prone to creasing and smudging. I can confidently wear it all day without worrying about touch-ups or smudges.  Overall, I am thoroughly impressed with the Kosas Soul Gazer Intensifying Gel Eyeliner. It has become an essential part of my everyday makeup routine, helping me achieve a natural and effortless look. If you're looking for an eyeliner that is easy to glide on and works well on aging skin, I highly recommend giving this product a try."

I tried applying to my under inner eyelids but it would not apply at all so I applied just below my lash line. The thing i did like was if you're running out, just twist and there's more product.

What I truly appreciate about this eyeliner is its hypoallergenic formula; having sensitive skin, I'm always cautious, but with Kosas, I know I won't experience any breakouts.  The only minor drawback I've encountered is with the color I chose, Bewitch. It requires a bit more overlapping to show up vibrantly on my skin compared to other shades, but this is more about the color itself rather than the product's performance. Overall, Kosas Soul Glazer Gel Eyeliner is a fantastic product that I highly recommend. If you're looking for a smooth application, easy manipulation, and skin-friendly ingredients, this is definitely worth purchasing."

It’s also retractable, which I prefer over pencils that have to be sharpened.   This liner did not budge or smudge either. I use jojoba oil as part of cleansing process to remove my makeup.

Kosas is a great brand with clean ingredients and usually a favorite of mine.  First off I usually don’t use a light color like this light purple so I thought it would be a fun color and it was.  It was so nicely pigmented.  Here is the thing, I was really expecting this to be a gel eyeliner, something soft, easy to apply and blend with the special blender attachment.  It also has a little sharpener to keep the tip pointy.  However it didn’t work as well as I had hoped.  As you can see in on of my photos a little piece broke off while I was trying to apply it.  As for it being waterproof I didn’t notice however I will add that it did last all day."

I have an issue with my eyeliner always running but not this gel eyeliner. It stayed but and I love how smoothly it glides. It's free of parabens, vegan, and cruelty-free which those are the things I look for when purchasing products in general. I love that it has a built-in sharper as well as a smudge tool. So, you get three things in one, which is very convenient. Overall, I absolutely love the pigment, the way it glides, and the attached sharpener and smudge tool. I have a new favorite eyeliner."

I got the shade chocolate brown which I think is a good shade for lighter skin tones since you might not want a dark black. I LOVE that it has hyaluronic acid in it. Your eyes need gentle ingredients on them and there’s nothing better than makeup that also works as skincare at the same time. I would recommend this eyeliner!"
