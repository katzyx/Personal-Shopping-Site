At first you can smell the pear but it‚Äôs really faint, it‚Äôs the caramel, amber, and vanilla that takes over. Freaking amazing! Can I also just say how surprised I am that the smell is still noticeable, I mean wow! I have yet to purchase it but I‚Äôm going to for Christmas. It kind of reminds me of Prada Paradoxe too."

I have purchased this perfume for all of my sisters and everyone adores this scent like no other.  It is a true gem. I always get compliments when I wear this, but I wear it because I cannot stop smelling my wrists and this fragrance is calming, uplifting and just flat out gorgeous. This is probably my favorite scent ever."

I have many travel sprays, but this is the only one that is an absolute disaster.  It doesn't spray well; sometimes its like a weak stream that gets everywhere except where trying to spray.   If you close the cap fully, especially after any of that weak stream had made contact with the rim, the cap gets stuck and will rip the entire top off the glass the next time you try to open it.  I lost about 1/3 of the bottle that way. I won't be buying again until the packaging is improved."

It‚Äôs not at all what I expected. I don‚Äôt get vanilla from this really at all. I get super sweet sugary pear with a green woodsy note. I‚Äôm not sure how to feel about it.  I think the name is deceiving and I don‚Äôt think this is what most people on the hunt for the perfect vanilla scent are looking for so try to test it in store if possible.

The longer it sits on your skin, the better it gets.

I‚Äôm a big vanilla girly and so this is definitely my type of scent, but I think it might not be for you if you don‚Äôt like the sweet, warm smells.

I bought the travel size so I could take on a big trip with me and my brand new bottle had less than a half left in it after flying. Before leaving I double checked that it was secure & closed and then thankfully had it packed in a ziplock. I was bummed arriving and seeing this but made sure to salvage what I had left on the way back - same thing happened. Super sad and bummed to miss out on this product & have money go to waste!"

After letting it dry down on the skin and forgetting about it, I kept getting the most delicious whiffs of super decedent vanilla, and I realized it was this perfume! This scent is the definition of addicting, I cant stop sniffing myself anytime I wear this. The rose and pear really add something so special to this fragrance, elevating it from a typical vanilla, to a complex fragrance experience. It is sweet but in the most ‚Äúreal‚Äù vanilla way. This fades beautifully throughout the day, but I continue to smell it for hours after I put it on which is super impressive for a clean perfume. I also LOVE this layered with pretty much anything just to add some sweet vanilla depth. My favorite layering combo with this is By The Fireplace by Replica."

The caramel is delicious and long lasting. There's sometimes a vague ashtray / chimney scent... not in a bad way, but again, smoke smells can be polarizing; for me it's the minimum to make it a little bit more interesting.

I can only try to describe it as the feeling you get when you walk into a house with something delicious and sweet in the oven. It's like a smooth velvety smell. Like you're in a warm dense forest after it's just rained,  you smell the damp wood from the trees and then you follow your nose to find the source of what might be fresh baked vanilla cupcakes in a cottage in the middle of an enchanted forest. This is probably what Hanzel and Gretal smelled when they were wandering in the woods, and if I smelled this I would wander right into a strange old lady's house and sit myself down and ask what's for desert. lol"

I poured it into my rollerball left over from my last purchase and will still be able to use the fragrance, but this applicator change makes me think I shouldn't buy this size again without an alternate packaging available at home.

			"review_text": "my favorite scent everrrr it‚Äôs literally my signature scent and i‚Äôve been obsessed with it longer than a year now. was looking for a scent that was distinct, all the designer perfumes are so meh to me; they smell really good but they don‚Äôt remind you of anything, this one immediately reminded me of my childhood lip glosses for some reason. personally it doesn‚Äôt last as long on my skin as it does for others (couple hours), which makes me so sad, also not the most ‚Äúscent cloud‚Äù strong type of scent but it lasts on my clothes. i pair it with the matching oil to make it last. i also layer it, it layers well with sol de janeiro 40! this scent isn‚Äôt for everyone; it‚Äôs a bit smoky in a way with a deep syrupy sweetness, im obsessed with it, however i recommend smelling in person and trying on the skin before buying"

I‚Äôm a big fan of gourmands‚Ä¶ some of my favorites are Ralph Lauren Beyond Romance, Marc Jacobs Daisy Love Eau So Sweet, Nest Golden Nectar, and Replica By the Fireplace! This is a wonderful fragrance for the vanilla and/or gourmand lovers! It has the most beautiful vanilla and amber sweetness to it! It‚Äôs warm yet freah and is softly floral and slightly woodsy! I‚Äôm not a fan of rose, but I really didn‚Äôt pick up much of a rose note in this! It‚Äôs beautiful throughout, from the first spray to the dry down! I bought it wanting a new fragrance for the upcoming colder months (I love coconut and Solar florals for the summer), but this absolutely will work year round! It lasts all day on me and has good projection! I had heard a lot of great things about this fragrance, so between that and reading the notes I‚Äôd decided it would be a safe blind buy‚Ä¶ I definitely recommend taking a chance on this one!"

I was so disappointed because when I first bought the bottle it was the most delicious vanilla I had in my collection! I ended up gifting it to a friend who wears this too and it smells amazing on her!"

It doesn't spray at all, it just drips out slightly down my hand.The whole top has a tendency to just come off when you're trying to take off the lid, which lead to perfume splashing in my eyes. I miss the roller ball."
