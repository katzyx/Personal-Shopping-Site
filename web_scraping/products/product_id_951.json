			"review_text": "OBSESSED with this setting powder! Blends and sets amazing if applied correctly. I will sing this product praises anytime someone asks for a recommendation for a setting powder. However, HOWEVER, please note that just because the product is labeled as ‚ÄòTranslucent‚Äô it does not mean it will apply translucent. If you look closely at the powder, you will notice that the powder is NOT white. The powder appears to be a very light light beige. Therefore, this powder is going to apply with the light beige tone. I‚Äôve seen reviews stating the powder oxidizes after sometime of wear. I‚Äôve seen this happen to other individuals where the base of their foundation is technically lighter than the translucent powder since they have a very fair complexion. Then, they‚Äôll apply the translucent powder (that contains a beige tone) and will notice that once the powder sets into their makeup it now appears to have a tan like or warm tone. This is more than likely because the powder is technically too ‚Äúwarm‚Äù for your foundation. I can attest to this since during the winter my complexion changes drastically and I can no longer use this translucent powder. I have to use a powder that has a white pigment."

The instructions say to use a velour puff, but it doesn‚Äôt come with one and I don‚Äôt own one (yet) so I used a few different methods:  a loose powder brush, a powder puff from other setting powder I own, and a smaller face brush. I tried to use as little powder as possible with the instructions seem to indicate and I do think that helped prevent settling and creasing, but I still noticed *some* powder settling into the fine lines around my eyes. As for preventing flashback, I don‚Äôt take a ton of flash photography so wasn‚Äôt able to test that. Ultimately I like the powder and will use it up, but I removed 1.5 stars for the minor creasing, the packaging and because I think for the price it should include the velour puff it suggests you use!"

Hands down, this is my new favorite, and I‚Äôm never going back to anything else. It instantly mattifies my skin, and sets my concealer all day long, even with my oily skin type. It‚Äôs also transfer and sweat resistant, which is amazing for the summer time when I‚Äôm constantly sweating. I highly recommend using a small, triangle shaped, powder puff, and tapping the product into the skin/over foundation because I‚Äôve noticed it gives a slight blurring effect when used that way. This a little bit more of a spendy product, but the container lasts me for ages. I‚Äôve been using this for over a month, and I feel like I‚Äôve barely made a dent in the amount of powder. I only wish this came will a little tray/cap on the inside that prevents the powder from coming out when you don‚Äôt want it to. Other than that, love this powder."

I ended up trying a few (I previously used Charlotte tilbury pressed powder, which is also quite good, though is pigmented), but this is the one I truly freaked out over once I applied it for the first time. It is so weightless and sets like a dream. It‚Äôs undetectable on my skin and effortlessly removes the excess shine that comes with having to apply multiple moisturizing and hydrating products.

The whole point of setting powder is to set your makeup, and cut down shine.I have very oily skin, so I need to use powder. As another reviewer said...this is not finely milled. It makes pores & fine lines more visible, and as yet ANOTHER reviewer points out, 20 to 30 minutes after applying it, my face is even oilier than it is if I don't wear any powder at all. Oh wait, the best part was that the few times I tried using this, I woke up with zits the size of marbles on my face.  I only tried this one because of all the great reviews, and it was cheaper than my tried and true Hourglass powder. I won't be making that mistake again. I'm convinced there are way more fake reviews than honest ones."

So if you like a matte finish, you definitely won‚Äôt like it. Don‚Äôt be afraid of it‚Äôs luminous shine, when you apply just the right amount using a natural brush, it will lay down with a thin layer. As I makeup artist I can also recommend it if you don‚Äôt have lots of skin problems‚Ä¶ because if you are the powder can empathize it. I also used it as a highlighter and it looked soo good, it gives off a very pretty natural glow. 4/5 ‚Äî long wear, perfect for summer, smoothing effect, but for someone it can be too glowy"

I‚Äôve been using it for setting my concealer, but have recently switched to the Laura Mercier under eye brightening powder.  It really brightens those dark circles. I don‚Äôt have creases in my makeup with either of the powders.  My only complaint is that there‚Äôs no way to control the outflow of the powder in the container when traveling.  The bottom part of the powder has tiny holes in it. So when you travel and the container gets flipped upside down, there‚Äôs tons of loose powder everywhere in the container. I have it rigged now with tape over the holes. So when I need to use the powder, I just remove some of the tape and tap some into the lid.  Then I just cover the holes back up with the tape.  It works pretty well and keeps the messiness at bay.  The container itself is huge and has lasted me for over a year"

It‚Äôs the one thing beauty gurus have gotten right regarding reviews. I will say however, if you have dry skin, it will really dry your skin out further. I wouldn‚Äôt bake if you have dry skin but use a little bit on a powder brush and sweep over any areas you don‚Äôt want to budge throughout the day. Overall, it‚Äôs an amazing product. :)"

I don‚Äôt really know if it‚Äôs worth it at that point when there are other great affordable powders out there."

Trick is to not use too much of it. It sets your makeup, doesn‚Äôt crease, and looks weightless. My makeup never gets cakey when I use it.  Most importantly, it doesn‚Äôt change the color of whatever I use underneath it. Some powders make my foundation and concealer turn yellow or orange. That never happens with this powder.   Keep in mind that it won‚Äôt brighten your undereyes, if that‚Äôs what you‚Äôre looking for."

			"review_text": "I used to use Coty Airspun powder, and I still do sometimes when I don't want to use my LM one. I loved my Airspun. It was quick to put on for a bake, it set my face but it always looked a little heavy and if I put just the tiniest bit to much, I got really Cakey. My Airspun was oil controlling, gave a little extra coverage, my concealer didn't crease for a long time, and it was my holy grail and I promised myself that I'd never spend no $38 on a powder that works just as good. And unfortunately some promises get broken. When I was at Sephora a month ago, I was pressured into buying this powder, but I got the Travel sized one just to make sure I liked it before I committed to buying the whole thing. I immediately fell in love with this powder the first time it touched my face. It wasn't like Airspun where it would just sit on my skin to bake, this powder actually sunk into my skin just setting the makeup perfectly. This powder NEVER looks Cakey or heavy, it's extremely oil controlling, and unlike Airspun where my concealer would crease after about 8 or 10 hours of wear, this powder NEVER made my concealer crease and I've even slept in this and woke up looking awesome. This powder is bullet proof. It makes your skin look matte, but not dull, dry, or cakey. It just look's amazing and can make any non long wearing makeup last all day long. I immediately went the next day and purchased the full sized container because I knew this was it. I definitely will repurchase over and over again. This is 110% worth the money!! They could have maybe thrown the puff in for the $38 price tag, but hey no complaints!"
