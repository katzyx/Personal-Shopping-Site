This helps my oily T-zone stay in check for hours longer than all the previous foundations I've tried and doesn't dry out the area around my mouth like the other products I've used in the past. This has been my go-to foundation for years now. Because of the high coverage, a little goes a long way and one bottle lasts me a long time so it's worth the extra cost. I recommend this product."

The degree of oxidation is just way too much for me. I bought the shade that matched my skin tone when I just applied it to my face but it started to turn orange and dull right away and made me look like I've pulled an all-nighter :( My face ended up being 2-3 shades darker than my neck... If you have a fairer skin tone, I STRONGLY recommend you trying this out in store and wait for 10 minutes to see if it oxidizes, or go one shade lighter.  But other than that this foundation does a very good job of smoothing pores and is indeed long-wearing. Even after wearing it for a very long time (like 10 hours), it does not rub off but instead produces a beautiful subtle creamy glow on my face."

			"review_text": "I recently lost my foundation while on a trip and had a friend give me a little sample bubble of this to tide me over. Even in a slightly “off” color, I was so impressed! I actually wore it on an impromptu hike and it stayed flawless. More so, the contour and other makeup I had on top of it also continued to sit nicely, even at the end of that sweaty day. In the evening I added a bit  of powder and it looked like fresh makeup. Once we got back to the city I went to see about a proper match ASAP.  It’s has a full coverage look without feeling too heavy. It is amazingly long lasting and stays put. The matte finish is lovely even over my few dry patches. Overall I would say it’s slightly more matte, but generally similar to Estée Lauder double wear, however I do prefer the Estée Lauder formula ever so slightly. In my experience I find this Dior formula is a bit thicker looking and feeling  - however this could be a matter of me needing to get more familiar with its application. I feel like the effect I have been getting is very “influencer” looking, super even skin tone, very pretty, but can lean a bit artificial looking. Certainly not caky or anything problematic, but I don’t think anyone is going to mistake it for the “no makeup” look. It “gives” in a manner that is beautiful, but also apparent.   Where this product shines most for me is the color selection - I have never been able to perfectly match my skin with a single shade of ELDW (I’ve always had to mix it with something) - with Dior’s selection of shades & undertones I can! While I won’t be abandoning my EL completely, I do like that this gives a similar effect, while also being one and done. The only true “con” I would note is that it has a (tolerable) sunscreen smell when applying.   For reference I have very fair cool-neutral skin. Other shades I wear include MAC NW10-15 & N3 depending on product/season, Nars Oslo (fall-spring), ELDW in 1C1 (in summer, or mixed with a lightener for other seasons)."

For a more matte look I use this one, for people with dry skin you neeed to prime and moisturize properly before applying. If you don’t moisturize anything mattifying will sit weird on your skin. This foundation is god sent when you do moisturize very well before application. The most important part of makeup application is how you prepare your skin so it sits correctly.

As I am aging I needed a product that covered the redness on my cheeks, sunspots etc. without being heavy.  I didn't want to see the makeup on my skin.  I'm also not into touching up during the day. I apply before my workday and wash it off in the evening, that's it.  My go to for years was estee lauder, applied lightly with a damp beauty blender.  I thought that was the best I was going to get with regards to coverage and staying power.  I was wrong!  I'm not sure why there are a low number of reviews for this foundation but perhaps it's an age thing.  I'm hooked! Apply with a damp beauty blender, great! Apply with a brush, amazing!  Easier to apply than ELDW but the coverage and staying power are the same for me.  No primer, no setting powder or spray.  Just moisturize, apply it and go.  Even close up in a magnification mirror or in daylight in the car mirror it looks like skin.  It even stays on my nose!  There is slight scent but I don't even notice it anymore and it looks so good that I don't even care.  The search is over for me."

I am the shade mont blanc in Nars foundations, for reference (but it’s slightly off when it oxidizes)."

The shade match is perfect unlike double wear that was always a little too dark. I wore it with my mask on for hours and had 0 transfer. The finish is really pretty too, it’s more of a soft matte, similar to the double wear light which I prefer. I took off one star for how quickly it dries, you can’t waste any time before blending. I saw a couple reviews saying that it oxidized after 20 minutes but after 3 hours it still looked perfect on my skin (normal to dry and pretty sensitive)."

In the winter I do make sure my skin is well hydrated before applying, as it is a more matte finish, but I imagine in the summer it will be great with just my normal skincare.  I have sensitive, combo skin that is quite reactive.  So far this foundation hasn’t broken me out.  I also use the concealer in the same shade and love it as well."

It is a beautiful foundation, soft, silky, smells wonderful and does have that buildable coverage element.  The issue for me with dewy/hydrating foundations is that they will hardly ever be full coverage just because of the glowy effect. Full coverage tends to be more in matte foundations because of that dry-down and solid color. Nonetheless I love this foundation, the only downside to this is that to get that buildable coverage I need to add MUCH more product to my face and it is something I like to avoid."

This product was highly recommended to me by a friend. I was definitely skeptical about using a matte foundation for my dry skin, but I was pleasantly surprised when I took a look at the first pump and found the consistency to be more liquid than creamy.  It wears well over moisturizer (which is a must for me), and it plays nice with other tinted moisturizers and products which is great because I am am not about to go change my whole routine and all my creams and moisturizers for one single foundation.  It didn’t really move a whole lot throughout the day and it looks natural. It actually doesn’t look like I’m wearing anything which is really impressive for a foundation.

It evens out my tone and still allows me to control coverage. After 8 hours of wear my GF still made a comment how my skin looked. It didn't settle into lines, it blended effortlessly and has a lovely scent that is almost calming (it wears off during dry down). One pump covers me during the day, two pumps gives me extra coverage for evening. If I thought it wouldn't be bad for my skin I would touch my face all day."

I have light/medium coloured combination skin (maybe more on the oilier side) with some acne scars, and I find that many foundations break apart and need a re-application by 5:00. I also relied on concealers because scars (even the fading ones), would always show through my foundations. But, wow...My life has changed...The Dior Forever foundation is a smooth, even, and light coverage that lasts all day. And when I say “light”, I mean a couple things: (1) it doesn’t feel like you’re wearing makeup, and (2) A little goes a long way. This is incredibly important to me, because I believe that ‘less is more’. Now I only use concealers for the under eyes (and bonus, it takes less time to get ready!). The glass pump bottle is sanitary and beautiful, and I swear that the makeup application is fool proof. I Highly recommend this product. You won’t be disappointed."

			"review_text": "i went in store to get colour matched because my skin tone changes drastically throughout the year. the makeup artist asked me what i've tried, what i like, and what i don't like in a foundation. i told her i have combination skin but because of the terrible winter we've had my skin has been very dry, i like a matte foundation that's not heavy, i always have an issue with it cracking around my smile lines, i like it long-wearing, and i like full coverage. she came back with this foundation and i was a little skeptical because of the price but when she put it on it felt so nice. it honestly had everything that i was looking for in a foundation. and i have the added issue of not having neutral, warm, or pink-toned skin, so she recommended me the warm olive and it was a flawless match. i wore it out that night and didn't tell anyone that i got new foundation but i received multiple compliments on how i looked like i was glowing. it played so nicely with the rest of my makeup. stayed put all night (even when i had an unexpected sleepover). and was so easy to take off. love this product so much."

			"review_text": "This foundation does look good on my skin, however I don’t find it makes my breakouts look quite as good as say Laura Mercier Flawless Fusion on my skin. It is a medium-buildable coverage, but it seems to use a decent amount of product to get the coverage I need over my acne. It wears well throughout the day, and touches up well with powder as well. I’m very concerned about the ingredients in this foundation. When using it daily for three or so days I began to see an increase in clogged pores (little white bumps) all over my face in places I don’t always get them. I stopped using the product and it began to clear up again. This foundation is very fragranced and I believe this is what is in the product to cause the breakout. If your skin isn’t sensitive or acne prone, and you don’t have a ton to cover up this could be perfect for you, especially if you need a longer wear. However for me it just isn’t Mr. Right, or even Mr. Right Now."

			"review_text": "I really wish I could write a good review about this product. The finish of the product looks amazing for about 5 hours-great coverage and not fully matte where your skin looks dull and cakey, it's more of a satin matte. However, after this time the foundation separates horribly. I've tried everything, different primers, setting powders, setting sprays and nothing works. This product also transfers.  I need a foundation to last at least through the work day. sadly will be returning this. Gave 3 stars because it is great if you don't need a long wearing foundation."

It does not cling to any dry patches on my skin. I also have very fair skin and this is a good colour match for me. Love it!"

			"review_text": "Excellent!!! I did not have the original and could not make the comparison. The original forever did not have my colour; not it comes in 0N. The colour is perfect. I have the Dior Body and Face. This new Forever beats it and it’s more light weight and lasts longer on my combo skin. I don’t think it’s Matt. It’s has very nice skin like formula and does not look like I have any foundation on. I wore 16 hours last night and it did not move or break down. I use just a thin layer of foundation and the coverage is medium."

			"review_text": "WOW! This foundation is so long-wearing it's unbelievable. I've worn this foundation for longer than 14 hours and it has held up incredibly. Most foundation is break up and becomes a little scaly from my oils but this one has held up the best out of all of them. It makes me look a little matte and dry during the first few hours but it by mid day, it really is able to hold my oils at bay. 10/10 would recommend."

			"review_text": "MY NEW HG! This foundation is photoshop in a bottle! It blurs out pores and makes your skin look so silky smooth! It is not a drying matte foundation, its very kind to dry matches and fine lines! It is similar to the backstage foundation but offers more coverage and evenness! Seriously this stuff is magic in a bottle! Definitely worth every penny because a little does go a LONG way! I can't believe how flawless my skin looks after using this!!!! It does oxidize a bit right away so keep that in mind (darker in shade but doesn't turn yellow or orange anything). When I swatched 4WO to my backstage I noticed it was LIGHTER in colour at first but within 10 mins it got about half a shade darker but nothing too dramatic! Still has that perfect olive undertone though. YOU NEED THIS!!!"
