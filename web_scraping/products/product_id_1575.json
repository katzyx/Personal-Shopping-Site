As someone with long hair who has never been able to curl their hair with a traditional wand, curler, I thought that I was stuck with straight hair forever. The only times Iu2019ve been able to accomplish beautifully curled hair has been when someone else has done it and even then it doesnu2019t hold a curl for long. There are so many features that make your hair curling experience customized to your needs. Reading the manual is critical so donu2019t skip thatu2019s There are two speeds to choose from. My hair is long so I like the lower speed to take my time getting the perfect wrap. There are also 9 heat settings and I usually donu2019t go higher than 6 to protect my hair. The higher the heat the tighter the curl Iu2019ve found. And lastly I usually have the timer set for five seconds to maintain equal heated curls, but you can go up to eight seconds or manually do it. I love that you can change the direction of the spin easily. Overall, this is the perfect tool for beginners or those who want an easy and customizable curling experience. This was gifted by t3hair. photo is right side curled Left side untouched."

Also the twisting thing definitely need some getting used to. I didnu2019t like that the ends where I would clip my hair would turn out crinkled, like a sharp wrinkle at the end, (not sure how to explain it correctly, see close up photo) until I figured out a way to release some hair and move it once the rest of the hair was wrapped around the barrel so I wouldnu2019t have that awkward sharp wrinkle at the end. Also I didnu2019t realize that I was curling my hair the wrong way at on one side until I finished and saw it wasnu2019t away from face. I do love the feature where it alerts you that the curl is done, and how quickly it heats up and it has the different heat options. I will have to practice more to get a hang of it. I did like the way my loose waves turned out. Gifted by T3 Micro."
