The color is neutral and doesn't clash with my skin tone (light olive). I love this. It has no smell, it's not greasy. It enhances your skin without covering it too much, and it's a quick shot of youth for my 40 year old skin. The only issue is longevity, I feel it doesn't stay on very long during the day. But the small size and soft finish make it an easy reapplication through the day or in the course of an evening out."

			"review_text": "I love Westman Atelier products. I’ve been loving using my contour and different shades of blush sticks for a beautiful, natural on a daily basis for years. I always paired them with either my Benefit highlighter stick (discontinued), so I thought I’d give the mini highlighter in Golden Peach. I’m disappointed, however. I’d show a photo but it’s barely visible on my light-to-medium skin tone at all. There’s really nothing wrong with the manufacturing even as a mini—the production is top tier in all my WA sticks, but, this highlighter lacks colour pigments to make it visible. Perhaps, it’s because it’s a mini or perhaps it’s the shade on my skin tone. It just doesn’t work out great for me and judging by other reviewers photos, it’s also maybe that what I received is a different formula because it’s very, very light and barely visible especially after an hour. I’m glad I only bought the mini. I will go to the store to test out the darker shade Brûlée that only comes in a full size to see if that’s a better option for my skin tone. Overall, it’s a 3 star product for me because I was expecting the same kind of colour payoff and longevity that I’ve grown to expect and love about WA makeup sticks. Moving forward, I’ll test in store first!"

I am in love with this line. That said...I still think it is priced for a market with deeper pockets than mine. 5 stars for the product, minus 1 star for the price point."

			"review_text": "I have been on the hunt for a natural, glow-y, highlight that looks dewy without looking oily or like Vaseline. Everything had far too much shimmer or chunky glitter.  I watched Amanda Z review highlighters on YouTube and fell in *love* with the look of this one. I felt it was worth the splurge to buy it....and boy was it worth it! A stunning yet modest highlight that has a natural feel to it and wears comfortable. I've always been sensitive to the weight of makeup on my face. Now that I've aged and my hormones have evened out and consequently so has my skin, I don't have to wear as much. With my fine lines less is more anyway. My makeup style is a swipe of a cream blush blended with my fingers, a bit of concealer on any problem spots, brown shadow as eyeliner and brown mascara, and now this! I sheer it out for a very natural, healthy look. It could definitely be used I'm more glamorous makeup looks but still beautiful for everyday wear. It has a wonderful finish to it that has a glow without shimmer or glitter. I don't know how it applies over foundation or powder products, but I am in love for my intents and purposes! I got the shade nectar and it looked great on my fair skintone. I tend to tan with a yellow-y undertone in the summer and find white pearlescent highlighters don't suit, but this color did nicely.  I can't wait to try other products from this brand. The packaging is also elegant and understated and reminiscent of Pat McGrath but matte and more accessible."

At first, I couldn't tell I had a highlighter on and was bummed. THEN, to my surprise, when the light hit the places I had applied it, it gave an amazing shine. There's no glitter. It's so clear that you almost can't see it when picking it up with your finger until you see a very slight purple, yes, purple hue. Don't let that scare you as it DOES NOT go on purple folks! I, personally, tap it onto my upper cheek and cupids bow, and it blends very well. One of the neat things about #WestmanAtelier and the blush, highlight, and bronzer trio (I'm sorry, I don't know which pronouns they use) is you can watch her/them apply all 3 on herself/themselves  on YouTube. Getting to see the owner personally use their products is awesome. She/they are not a 20 some year old, instead she/they are more mature. In recent light of being told that cream products such as this stunning Highlight are great for more mature skin. Now, that part is still out with the jury. But I do tend to look into this as I am no spring chicken. With all that said, I will be repurchasing this highlighter and the rest of the trio in full size or mini, depending on what is available. I recommend you too to give this a try."

This highlighter performs at its best layered with as little other product as possible ( It gets lost sooo easily! ); It definitely has to be a no makeup makeup choice for me.

This highlighter stick is none of those things. It's pigments are so fine you can't see individual shimmer pieces and the color blends with my light skin beautifully. It is so creamy and goes on very light. It didn't smudge any of the makeup I had on underneath. I also put some on my fingers and blotted and it felt a little like a Vaseline consistency. I have used NARS highlighter sticks in the past and they felt chalky and powdery dry and that's what I was expecting but the Westman Atelier one is sooooo creamy and moisturizing I want to use it every day. It's subtle enough to wear with no makeup too. The packaging is also just gorgeous and the cap is magnetic, making me feel expensive and luxurious during my makeup routine. I will definitely buy this again when I run out!"

The quality of the rest of the packaging is less than I'd like and definitely less than their other stick products, like the blush.  Is it great, yes, is it worth the money? no.
