I’ve recently paired this with the Givenchy peach color corrector for my dark circles. Both products are must haves!"

It blends seamlessly, leaving the skin looking smooth, hydrated, and refreshed, with noticeable improvements in dark circles and redness. The creamy texture is particularly comfortable for all-day wear, making it perfect for both everyday use and special occasions. Highly recommend it for its multitasking capabilities and skin-caring benefits!"

I haven’t experienced any creasing or patchiness either. I did a comparison with some of my other concealers. The top if Givenchy W310, the middle is Dior Forever Skin Correct in 4 Warm, and the bottom is Westman Atelier Vital Skincare in T2."

I had a big struggle learning how to use this concealer because if your skin isn’t prepped correctly it will get patchy. This concealer is more “wet” like, and not as hydrating as I thought it would be, also I believe this concealer is easier to blend with a concealer brush not a beauty blender.

I don't really find it nearly as hydrating as I was told it would be. It doesn't misbehave but it leaves me wanting to use something else after every time I use it."
