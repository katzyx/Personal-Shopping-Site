The starting point for Scent Space, the Expressive fragrance names have no signs or symbols...About the Fragrance: I really wanted to redefine what a juicy scent is.

On the skin though this pulls very different. I've had it on a couple hours and it's starting to grow on me.  The initial blast of rose discipates pretty fast and leaves a meddly of juicy berries with a hint of greenery. I don't get any specific strawberry or raspberry notes unfortunately but it is a very bright, femine and flirty fragrance! I wouldn't wear it all the time as I much more prefer gourmands but this would be amazing in the spring and summer. If you're like me and you hate it on paper, give it a chance on the skin and see if you feel differently! Not my favorite, but definitely worth the try. Solid 7/10."

It has the same underlying smell of every Victoria Secret perfume. If you're not a fan of rose, don't waste your money."

I ended up not buying at the store but  I had to come back on the website and get it lol. How it smells on you really depends on your body physics not all scents are made for your skin and not everyone’s skin is the same. So if it smells bad on you that’s not the perfumes fault."

			"review_rating": 5,
			"review_shade_purchased": "",
			"review_buyer_description": "Hazel eyes, gray hair, Combination skin",
			"review_text": "First scent is a Raspberry and strawberry with a slight pink pepper fizz (although it’s not pink pepper. The cyclamen which has a pepper quality to it. This note remains subtle throughout.)  After 5 minutes, there’s something fresh, most likely rhubarb. A sweet green with a little tang. Rhubarb can be tricky for me; I don't always like it, but here I do.  15 min: something tart but light. There’s raspberry cherry in the background. I’m not sure how this projects. It’s about arms length. The amber wood begins to surface. It’s woody, not heavy or dull but slightly resinous (but NOT incense or smokey). The fragrance is becoming sweet, almost powdery (is this the cyclamen?).  1 hour: fruit notes are hanging in there~ not like candy. Just a pulpy ripe fruit blend, a raspberry with depth. There’s a little powderiness. Definitely sweeter and more leaning toward a resinous amber wood. Still a little peppery.  3-4 hours: still fruity, a little freshness and warm, resinous fruit. And the raspberry is hanging in there! That light peppery quality is there, too, along with a warm base of amber wood. From here on, the fragrance remains basically the same.  5 hours and there’s still raspberry! More of a skin scent now. The smell lasts on my wrists for at least 6 hours.   I really like this! For a fruit, the staying power is of the raspberry is amazing. Usually fruit burns off quickly. I think raspberry, in general, is a fruit with longevity. I’ve noticed this in Wavechild. But Wavechild is like candy. This is a raspberry with depth and a little tang. This is a well-blended fragrance in my opinion."

The perfume also transforms over the first 10 minutes of application. At the beginning, it is a sweet scent, then moves more towards dark and dusky. I would say that everyone should smell the perfume before they buy it, but I am glad not to regret my decision!"

My skin amps amber in any perfume that has it so the amber wood makes it smell quite warm and inviting but in a way that makes it appropriate in any season on me. The raspberry and strawberry aren’t too juicy on me, it’s more of a grown kind of juicy instead of a younger body spray kind of juicy - I assume that’s the cyclamen and rose rounding it out. It isn’t that sickly sweet candy kjnd of juicy to me.   What really surprised me was how different it smells spritzed on clothes - I can distinctly smell the raspberry and rhubarb and it had more of a fresh, ripe fruit smell that’s light and airy - I can barely smell the amberwood with it all, so a unique sensory experience. My scent space kit also had Juice- (the personal space one) and that is much more floral on me in comparison to this one. Both very much worth a try and I will be keeping the full size!"

This is their first new scent in years, since they were sold and relaunched with the scent spaces.  I would recommend sampling before purchasing so you can know what “space” you like the best, as there are different notes in each one. Perhaps that’s why some of the reviews are noticing other elements than I am? The expressive is the middle tier of the 3 and it’s perfect for me, and this is the only one I have tried. It doesn’t announce me to a room, but if someone’s close by me it is likely to be noticed. The longevity is impressive, and a little goes a very long way."

I smell the strawberries more than the raspberry note.  The dry down and the base note is a little earthy, but it’s not overpowering. I still smell the fruitiness of it and I love it. I would layer this with a fruity body lotion or body butter to bring out more of the fruitiness, but this is definitely a summer, beachy fragrance . I really love it and I’m probably going to purchase the large bottle."

A hint of amberwood gives it a nice, warm, slightly woody undertone to balance out all that fruity deliciousness. It’s lively, flirty, and vivacious without being cloying or too sweet. Juice is a happy, succulent, and unique scent with great lasting power and year-round versatility. It’ll shine bright in the summer, and I can picture it brightening up dull winter days. Love it! I will definitely be purchasing a full bottle."

I love fruity notes in my fragrances but they typically end up leaning a bit juvenile and this one doesn’t at all, it’s elevated and classy. On initial spray I get those strawberry and raspberry pulp notes, it’s juicy and bright. Then as it settles into my skin more that rhubarb becomes more present which really adds some depth to the fragrance and then once it dries down there’s also a woody scent I’m picking up on. I know I’ll be reaching for this a lot in the spring and summer months because it’s not cloying and performs well in high heat but I think this could be worn year round and it also had great longevity for me."

I wore this to work today and got a ton of compliments.  One of my staff told me that I smelled delicious! If you like fruit but in a clean aesthetic way, this is it! I will be buying a full sized version of this and maybe later it with Milk."

I have never smelled anything similar to it before so that makes this scent even more unique. I would recommend wearing this on a date because it is sexy!"

However, the first time I sprayed it, I felt that it is such a perfect match to their line. This perfume is fruity floral, it is light, but projects well. It’s very inoffensive and I think a lot of people would love it. I smelled it without knowing the notes, so for me it smelled like pink peppers and red currant in the opening. As it started drying down, it smelled sweet and berry like, but gentle and not overpowering. Looking at the notes, I can see how rhubarb can smell like red currants, but I don’t particularly smell strawberries or raspberries - just berries in general. It’s a beautiful scent and I can see myself reaching for it all year round."

It’s not too cloying, and can be worn on multiple occasions. The name is perfect, it’s a mouth-watering experience. I love that this feels so fun."

This smells incredible, i definitely get the strawberry when i first spray it but it’s not bad at all. Then when it starts to settle it smells amazing such a fruity floral scent. Give it a few to settle in. Get a good 6 hours and then I no longer smell it on me but given that it’s a fruity floral 6 hours is really decent."
