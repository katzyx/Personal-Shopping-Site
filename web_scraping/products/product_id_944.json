In terms of hydration and longevity, it is amazing. However it is thick and sticky and it can be uncomfortable. This balm is so light weight and it feels amazing! It doesn't last as long as but for how light weight it is, it is incredible. Depending on my needs, I have found my two holy grail daytime lip balms. This set is a good deal."

			"review_text": "This is my favorite lip balm and I like these over the sleeping masks. The balms are more moisturizing for me and omg the scents are soooooo juicy while being subtle. Gummy bear is my favorite it smells like grape gum/jelly. I want to say berry smells like skittles. And vanilla isn't too heavy which i like since I don't really like gourmand scents. The value of this set is incredible and the selection of flavors is perfect! I now feel the need to buy every flavor!   Summer Fridays is too strong and sweet for me where they go for gourmand scents. I like how Laneige scents are more fruity and has mild sweetness to it I feel like it's perfect for people who don't like to eat super sweet things but enjoy the smell of them if that makes sense."

I didn't read anything on the actual packaging since I didn't expect any surprises, and was just messing with the box for fun. If you open the box fully instead of just taking the balms out of the front, there are a couple of sample creams! I love having these for travel, so it was a pleasant find."
