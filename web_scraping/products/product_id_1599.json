			"review_text": "I’ve been buying this for a long time. I typically buy the largest size, so it lasts a while. I was running out and grabbed the smaller one that was in stock. This was my first time seeing the new refillable packaging. I am so disappointed! I’ve always viewed Tatcha as a more prestigious brand with excellent products and luxurious like packaging. Unfortunately, I can’t say the same about this new container. It’s lightweight and looks awful. There’s plastic ridges all around the rim which accentuates the cheaper material. There’s even a picture and writing talking about the refill permanently on the container making it look way worse. If I didn’t know about this change, I would’ve been 100% convinced that someone swapped my product out and I received a counterfeit one. If you’re new to this product, you have no idea what you missed out on. Thankfully, I can swap the moisturizer out of this container to my older version. I understand the need to help the environment, but this was clearly an opportunity to cheapen their cost while disguising it as a positive change."

I ordered the mini version of the indigo cream as shown (15 ml / 0.5 oz), and they decided to send me what looked like a tester. It was UNSEALED, and it shows blank in my statement instead of showing the product I ordered. After back-and-forth with several associates and being gaslighted into believing that I ordered a product I never bought that apparently and very conveniently disappeared from the website, they told me to leave a review instead of solving the problem like any other company would.  Unlike them I do have receipts, so beware this can happen."

I tried it for a week to make sure my face didn't break out like some reviewers had mentioned, and it was so incredible that I ordered the largest size and have been using it ever since. I'll definitely keep purchasing, because even my Clarins cream wasn't cutting it anymore. Since I started menopause, my normal type skin has been so dry, especially under my eyes, no matter how much water I drink or how well I take care of my skin. I didn't know this brand, but my colleague who really knows face cream brands told me afterwards that this is one of the best she knows, and she's right. It's a steep price but it's worth it if you need super moisturizing cream that leaves your skin dewy and soft. Normally I wouldn't waste it on the neck and décolleté region either, but it really makes my 53-year old skin look supple and young. The cream is so soft and creamy that it's like a spa experience in a little pot, I feel spoiled."

			"review_text": "Firstly, the rating is not for the Tatcha product itself! The cream straight from the brand is amazing but this review is not going to be about the efficacy of the product. It's going to be about the fact that I bought the cream from Sephora and had it shipped to me only to find out that the packaging is nothing like the product from Tatcha, which makes me realize that Sephora is a big faker! I don't know where they got this from but it most certainly is NOT Tatcha!! The jar is much smaller and more to the point much lighter, meaning it looks and feels exceedingly FAKE! it doesn't have its normal expiration stamp on the bottom nor does it have the fold out ticket where you can read info on the product either. The jar pretty much feels like a Dewy skin cream from Temu and it is infuriating! The worst part is that I can't even return it nor get a refund because I do not live in a country that has access to Sephora, so you can imagine how hard it was for me to acquire it! I've gotten this cream quite a few times over the years so I know exactly how the product is supposed to be like, I also got another Tatcha cream from Amazon that is very clearly from Tatcha and comparing the two, who are supposed to have the same jars despite being different creams, makes it very clear that something is very wrong! I never knew that Sephora would be producing and selling fake products NOT from the brands themselves! it certainly does not make me want to be a Sephora customer anymore, and I've been one now for almost 5 years!! In the pictures you can clearly see that the jars are very different in sizes and the ticket on the back is not close to being the same, the Dewy one even has some number stamp on it which very obviously proves that it's a fake! I was going to put more pictures, including ones where you could see the fold off ticket on the real jar, that you can't see on the fake Dewy jar but apparently you can only put 2 pictures with your review, for some reason!"

I fell in love with this the first time I tried it and have repurchased the 2.5iz size twice since. My skin hasn’t looked this good in years. Most moisturizers are too occlusive and cause congestion on my skin. This doesn’t. And it gives me a dewy plumpness that is absolutely gorgeous."

			"review_buyer_description": "Brown eyes, black hair, Fair skin tone, Normal skin",
			"review_text": "From research based upon the brand and product from a Licensed Esthetician perspective While Tatcha is widely praised for its luxurious skincare products inspired by Japanese beauty rituals, there are a few reasons why some people might find the brand unsuitable for their needs:  Price Point: One of the primary criticisms of Tatcha is its high cost. Many of its products are significantly more expensive than other skincare brands, making it less accessible to the average consumer. Some users feel that the pricing does not always justify the results, especially when comparable products exist at a lower price point.  Fragrance: Tatcha products often contain fragrance, which can be an irritant for sensitive skin. Though the brand uses natural fragrances, even these can sometimes cause reactions, particularly for those with skin conditions like eczema or rosacea.  Minimal Active Ingredients: Some critics argue that Tatcha's products focus more on luxury and sensory experience than on potent, scientifically proven active ingredients like retinol or high percentages of vitamin C. This could make Tatcha products less effective for individuals seeking targeted skincare solutions for concerns like aging, acne, or hyperpigmentation.  Over-Hyped Marketing: Tatcha has a significant celebrity following and substantial marketing that emphasizes luxury and tradition. Some users believe that the brand is overhyped and that the actual efficacy of the products does not always match the lofty claims made by the brand's marketing efforts.  Heavy Emollients: Some Tatcha products contain heavier oils and emollients, which may not be suitable for people with oily or acne-prone skin, as these ingredients can be comedogenic for certain skin types.  While Tatcha may be a great fit for some, it’s important to evaluate whether the formulations and price align with your individual skincare needs."

I ONLY buy the 2.5oz jars BECAUSE the price point per ounce is CHEAPER. Why would you not make the 2.5oz size the refillable pod and make it EVEN CHEAPER?? I just think that decision was tone deaf on their actual customer base. Any time I'd get a sample size or if there was a super sale on the 1.7 I would literally do the math and if it was a better price I'd buy it THEN TRANSFER it to my 2.5oz jar. I LIKE THE BIG JARS. I think this kinda stuff is a poor attempt at trying to look eco friendly but in reality it's STILL NOT WHAT WE WANT and you're creating MORE plastic by putting in the smaller size. Like I said, nobody who has used this cream for the last 3+ years is buying 1.7 jars anymore. If I did buy a refill pod, I'd be transferring it to my 2.5oz jar anyway so WHY not make the refill pod in a 2.5?!"

Almost immediately after using the cream again, my face began to burn. Despite my better judgment, I continued to use it, hoping things would improve. Instead, my skin broke out in little red bumps, and I developed dry, flaky patches on my cheeks and the outer corners of my mouth.  I was in denial at first, thinking it couldn’t be this cream that had worked so well for me in the past. However, the evidence became undeniable as my skin condition worsened. I’m now left with dark spots where the dry patches were, and I’m struggling to heal my skin and restore it to its former state.  This experience has severely impacted my self-confidence. It's incredibly disappointing to see such a drastic negative change from a product that used to be a staple in my skincare routine. I am deeply dissatisfied and will not be repurchasing this cream again."

And can we take a moment for the packaging? It's like they bottled up a piece of heaven in that beautiful purple jar. It makes my skincare shelf look so fancy, I almost feel bad hiding it away in my bathroom! 😂  But wait, there's more! It's packed with good stuff like Japanese purple rice and Okinawa algae, which are like superfoods for your skin. Major points for the clean ingredients list! 🍚🌊  Now, for the tiny bumps on this smooth road: it's a bit on the pricey side, which makes my wallet cry a little. 💸 Also, if you're super oily, you might find it a tad too rich for everyday use.  Overall though, if you want to treat yourself to a little luxury and give your skin that lit from within glow, the Tatcha Dewy Skin Cream is definitely worth a try! ✨ Your skin will thank you, and you might just find yourself taking extra selfies because of how good you look. 😉"

I had high hopes because I've heard so much about it, but even with proper skin prep that includes exfoliating, vitamin C, etc. I felt that very little of this product actually absorbed into my skin. I have normal skin tending to dry at its worst so I had hoped it would feel weightless and soak in as the product description suggests. It felt like a mask and throughout the day, with no other moisturizer application, I found that my skin felt sticky or dewy as the name does suggest. I continued using this product for a month and tried different application techniques also, but still felt like the product sat on my skin and wiped off all benefits by the end of the day. While this was not the outcome I hoped for, this is not to say that the 'dewy' look might be what others hoped for, just not what I wanted in a daily moisturizer.  Some positives about the product are cute packaging and I really appreciate the application stick for getting the product out of the container."

The applicator that comes with it is super helpful when applying to minimize waste, I just scoop a pea sized amount and then dab a little to each quadrant of my face then rub in. I have combination skin and I find that this is lightweight enough that it doesn't make me oily in my T zone, just making my skin feel dewy and soft, while also being strong enough for my dry patches. I also like that the fragrance is quite subtle. I don't regularly break out (just some hormonal spots) and I find that this doesn't give me pimples. 4/5 stars instead of 5/5 because the price point is a bit high."

However, for this moisturizer I only had to put on very little and I still felt the hydration.  After a couple of days, I started to notice that my skin was feeling softer and I did notice some dewiness to my face.  I hadn't realized it was a dewy skin cream at first.  The mini size lasted me about two weeks since I didn't need much product. A small amount really does work and I feel better hydration that my other moisturizer.  I did buy the value size, and I feel that this will last me a year if not more.  There is no need to add more as I already feel it working and hydrating.  I would recommend this product!"

A little goes a very long way so the product does last longer than other moisturizers. I have very sensitive, dry, eczema prone skin, and I have autoimmune conditions affecting my skin.

Flakey, uneven, and broken out.  I wish it would've kept working for me but unfortunately, it doesn't anymore.  A steep price to pay for something that no longer works for me."

It was a tough one, I'll tell you. I love cream-gels, but the ones I've tried recently barely did anything for hydration and mostly irritated my skin. This cream is not geal, like I'm used to, and it's reach and creamy, but not at all heavy. I finally have hydrated skin that doesn't flake in the middle of winter in NYC! And the plumping effect works! I'm 29 and recently started noticing small changes in my skin (aka aging). I developed thick wrinkles on my forehead and started using retinol serum. Combined with this cream my wrinkles are all smoothed out, I'm sure no one except me can see them now. Cheeks also look better, generally skin is less dull. Will continue using."

I’ve never been good at having loyalty to any one product because I love trying new things but tatcha was my exception, it made my skin noticeably better. I was getting compliments on my skin! I purchsed a new container maybe 6 months ago and slowly started to develop dermatitis. I was using TRET at the time so I assumed it was that, never even considering it could be my tatcha moisturizer. I removed all harsh products from my skin care including the tret, even going as far as not using cleanser to wash my face, to no avail, my skin was getting worse not better. Finally this past week I decided to stop using my tatcha and only use cerve on my face a lo and behold after nearly 6 months of red inflamed, flaky and embarrassing skin my skins finally getting better and seems to be healing. I don’t think it’s a coincidence that my healing came after I stopped using this product. I really really want to believe there was some error in the batch or perhaps a formula change as I’ve seen other reviews with similar stories. I hope that we can get back to the amazing product I first experienced. Until then I have to stay away from this product."

I buy a mix of professional grade skincare and Sephora products, as I feel most off-the-shelf products don't have the power I need. That said- if I could pick one product to put in everyone's Sephora basket, it would be this one. It does have a scent, but I've come to look forward to it. I use it layered with other products, both in the morning and at night. It never pills up or sits on the surface- it moisturizes deeply. I prefer this cream to much more expensive options, and I'm so reassured by Tatcha's continued commitment to clean beauty.

I have so much of it left because I only use it on an everyday basis in the winter months because my skin gets incredibly dry. I tried so many lotions before The Dewy in hopes of not having to have dry, tight, flaking skin patches constantly in the winter. This is the first lotion that moisturizes my face all day long and into the evening and completely gets rid of any flaking skin & the tight feeling. Oh, and a little goes a LONG way with this one. I love the lotion spoon it comes with because it helps prolong the lotions shelf life by not having to contaminate it with whatever residues & possible bacteria your fingertips put into the lotion, but also it's so awesome for making sure you don't overuse. All you need is a tiny amount for each area of your face. Too oily for day use & under makeup, though. Also it doesn't need to be as expensive as it is."

It’s wild how different and how much more effective it feels than the drug store alternative I was using!

I could not be happier with this. I eyed it for years and just could not get over the price point for some reason even though two of my other favorite face creams are a lot more expensive than this so when I finally realized that there was a mini - I just couldn't say no to missing out anymore. To be fair, when people complain about the size of this mini, I just don't get it - it lasted me almost three months and that was using a decent sized dollop in the morning and night. This is a heavier formula (mid-weight range I would say) that means you do not have to add an excessive amount and this is coming from someone with the most intense dry facial skin at times. This has a light fragrance that can be found with all of Tatcha's products so I would recommend trying to smell a sample if you are sensitive to this area of a product. I feel smoothed out after applying without the tacky feeling and it also does not make me feel oily or mess with my other skin prep that I do before putting on a full face of makeup. I have about two days worth left in my container and I will be putting a full size in my cart today to purchase."

Not sure what ingredients didn’t work for me. Left me with dry patches and cracks on edge of my nose and gave me dark spots on the edges of my mouth. Took me a few days to heal from my nose and I now have to find a dark spot corrector for everything else. I left two stars because I cant say anything bad about the application and how smooth it felt before it gave me irritation. I wish it had worked for me. But I’m glad it was only the sample size I got before finding out."

I first tried Tatcha a while back, but did not see the hype. Even when I had acne-prone skin, the water cream wasn't really worth the price tag. I would say this is a better product than the water cream IMO.

After my skin had stopped being dry and flakey, I noticed this cream began to not soak into my skin as much (take forever to dry on the face) and soon after…cystic style acne. I have now switched to the lighter water cream but will be able to use this as a standby if I get another dry spell. I 100% recommend this to the dry to combination skin friends like me as it will really help save your skin! Just be mindful to listen to when your skin tells you it’s had enough moisture and needs something lighter than this.

Then after I noticed the break out on my forehead a day later I began to break out on my cheek and got a couple big pimples on my cheeks, chin, forehead, etc.  After trying to find out what was breaking me out I realized it was most likely this product after reading other reviews. I took it out of my skincare routine and my breakouts were gone within the week. This product broke so many other people out. It's definitely not worth your money if you have sensitive skin. My skin is dry and sensitive, so I thought this would help with my dry spots, and yes it did moisterize my face but I can get the same effect with a cheaper and better moisturizer that won't break me out. I also wore this throughout the day and I thought I was sweating. Nope. It was the moisturizer. I would touch my face and see just dewy residue on my hands that I couldnt wipe away. It also made me feel like I was sweating and had a somewhat nasty feel when I was outside for a while. Waste of money."

			"review_text": "I switched to this Tatcha Dewy Skin Plumping moisturizer due to my skin being sensitive, combination and needing more hydration in some areas (Flaky patching around smile lines & chin area mostly hormonal) without causing breakouts in my normal areas.   This magical skin cream was at the top of my price budget list. I do have to say I did try a sample months ago, from an online order, but after it was gone, I went back to my usual because it was cheaper.  Nearing the end of my regular moisturizer & tired of the flaky patches, I decided to give this a shot, it's worth every penny and last so much longer than my old one which was the same amount QTY wise, but I had to use three times the amount. A little of this cream goes a very long way, it's creamy, without being heavy, absorbs well, yet leaves my skin feeling very hydrated all day long. My foundation applies flawlessly over it, without pilling and without flaky patches showing up once I've applied foundation on my skin & it's settled, which was a huge problem with my other long time moisturizer. There is nothing like feeling great going out the door only to realize, your make-up is flaking off. This no longer happens, because with THIS - my skin is hydrated, ALL DAY! It's the one this I changed from my whole routine.  I'm turning 50 and while I've been very lucky to not have a lot of wrinkles for my age. As I mentioned, I do have combo skin, not a lot of breakouts, normal skin in most areas but those scaly dry skin patches and redness have vanished within days of using this cream.   I love reading everyone's reviews, but I rarely see reviews for woman my own age and up - so I hope you ladies 49 and up, give this product a try if you are having similar issues."

Then, shortly into using this product, I started to develop an acne-like rash that would not go away no matter what I did. I had never struggled with acne before and my skin looked terrible so I was concerned. I went to the dermatologist and was diagnosed with perioral dermatitis. The doctor said this can be caused by certain moisturizers. I emailed tatcha and was told it might not work for every skin type but it was dermatologist tested so I thought maybe my skin was just too sensitive for it. I gave the rest of the product to my friend since I could no longer use it, and shortly after he developed periocular dermatitis. It was so strange that the same condition happened to both of us within months and the only connection we can make is this moisturizer. It’s also strange because this condition happens mostly in women and he is a man. We had to get on antibiotics and use a prescription cream and it was such a pain to get rid of. I DO NOT recommend this product. There are so many amazing and clean products out there and this is not one of them. If you want moisturizer that’s good for your skin look into La Rouche Posay or Cera Ve."

A little goes a very long way, and I'd recommend emulsifying the product before use by warming it in your hand and rubbing it before applying so that it isn't quite so thick and pore clogging. A definite no for normal or oily skin, however."

The product doesn't sit on the skin and remain greasy but seems to absorb well. I like that the fragrance is mild and seems mainly natural. You can smell the thyme extract. The ingredients seem quite unique, which I like. I haven't been using this long or consistently enough to say if I'd buy it but I think it's pretty good. I think the pH of the cleanser was a little higher than ideal. I'd be curious to check the pH of the cream.  I typically go for the skin care gift at my birthday and last year was laniege-a brand I wasn't impressed by and wouldn't purchase from. Tacha impressed me more and I think it's great that Sephora has this program as it would be quite difficult to make good choices otherwise. Ingredient lists are also very insightful."

After some more time I started to break out so I looked further into the ingredients and found out it has fragrance in it. Pretty disappointing as I already have acne prone skin. I switched over to using beef tallow balm from VanMan Company about a month ago and it has done absolute wonders for my face. If you have acne prone skin, combination, or just dry skin I highly recommend looking into VanMan Company because it’s all clean products and my skin looks great.

I don't typically use anything with fragrance which makes me wonder if that is what is contributing to the break outs. I don't have sensitive skin and can usually try any product without worrying about weird reactions, but considering I didn't change anything else in my skincare routine except this and then had all these break outs, I really am thinking they are correlated.

Now it feels greasy and almost like petroleum jelly in a very uncomfortable way - like I want to wash it off as soon as it’s on.

I typically have acne prone skin and it can be difficult to try something new in hopes that it doesn’t aggravate. There was absolutely no problem for me using this product. It really moisturized my skin, which is rare that overnight I would feel its benefits the next day with my skin actually feeling moisturized and give me really nice soft skin. I will be purchasing the full size of this moisturizer since I got such good results… I can’t stop raving about how much this improved my skin (smooth skin, truly moisturized skin the next day, glowing skin)."

The consistency is different. It does not hydrate my skin at all, in fact it feels just like a cheap lightweight moisturizer. This is really disappointing and I hope it gets fixed soon. I have seen complaints about these expensive brands hiking up their prices but cheapening their formula, and I now believe it. Something is definitely not right here."

Especially with the cold weather I am in. It leaves my face soft and is not sticky or oily. I, however, noticed that while this works well by itself, I can not use it with other products as it starts pilling. Including after the Rice wash cleanser. So I use this as a morning moisturizer and the cleanser at night with my Hyaluronic acid serum. I did purchase the Gratitude size on Tatcha's website. I have yet to use that as I still have my sample so I am curious to see if there is a difference in formula between both sizes like people are saying.

I had same problem when I gave it a try because I did not want to waste that money. Thats where my second complaint comes in. $22 for not even half an oz is ridiculously overpriced. It would be better not to even get involved with this skincare line because you have to pay out the rear to keep up with your skincare routine. Definatly not worth the price or the hype."

My skin stays soft but not overly oily all day, but it also doesn't give me that tacky, there's-stuff-on-my-face feeling. Reason 2: it is fragranced but it's not strong, I don't find I can smell it after it's applied. If you have sensitive skin keep that in mind. Reason 3: I used it under the IT cosmetics CC cream and also with a smashbox concealer and did not experience any pilling. I find you can also put supergoop unseen sunscreen on top of it and it won't pill at all, so I think this moisturizer just doesn't have much silicone/dimethicone if any. Overall, this is probably the best moisturizer I've tried so far, which is unfortunate because she is expensive expensive (imo). That said, a little does go a long way, so if you do invest in this cream, you shouldn't need to rebuy every month; maybe every six months at most."

So if you're looking for an eye cream that's not over $50, this could be it.

I got this cream for my birthday gift in the trial size, I have been using it for about two weeks so far and I am sooo in LOVE! I want to try all the Tatcha products now!!!!!! My husband and I also both love everything with Japanese ingredients in them, and Japanese culture so that's a plus. Even though the products are pricey I really believe they are worth it and I got the go ahead from my husband to purchase every product in the line! It will be a lot of money and I'm worried about the price but this cream has made my face so soft and silky!! I have dry skin lately and its been a lifesaver!!!!! and such a time saver!!!"

I am swapping all beauty and wellness products to cruelty free alternatives and have been looking for a good substitute for my Cera Ve moisturizer, which is excellent for year-round use. I am in my 30s so I am focused on anti-aging and repair and am seeking a cost-effective cruelty free moisturizer than sinks in well, maintains moisture for long periods of time, and doesn’t cause breakouts. I LOVED the glowy finish on this moisturizer but noticed after a couple of days that my skin was getting really dry while using this product. I tried coupling this moisturizer with a heavier serum/face oil, but no luck. After a week of use, I had a couple of flaky, dry spots on my face and had to relinquish this to neck and hand moisturizer. If you have less dry skin, I could see this as being a great option. Cruelty free status is a bonus but the combination of cost, plastic packaging, and no “sticking power” to this moisturizer means that it won’t join my permanent line up."

Love that it comes with a scoop to keep bacteria out. The smell is perfect. The feel is like wrapping your skin in a silk blanket. SO comforting and rich while still remaining silky and absorbent.  It feels expensive and luxurious. I was recently supplementing with a different cream and repurchased my tatcha today and nearly cried with joy.

The downside, in tandem with using this product with the other Tatcha Dewy skin products, I seem to be getting a negative reaction. I notice a burning sensation just minutes after applying the product. I also notice slight oiliness on my nose. If it weren’t for the irritants and the golf ball sized air pocket in the gratitude sized container (which makes me feel like it’s a rip off) I would recommend."

Been using this for over 2 years.  It is definitely on the heavier side and I can see why people with oily skin might hate this. If you have normal skin use a small amount. If you have extremely dry skin like me, using more pays off, but still a little goes a long way. I usually Apply a good amount before bed and wake up in the morning with beautiful skin. Keep in mind guys you need to get what works with your skin and companies make different items to suit your needs. Any light moisturizer that has a water base is perfect for oily skin. Any dewy glowy heavy cream is great for dry :)"

I’ve noticed my skin is smoother now and it feels more elastic in a way, like it feels fuller when I touch my face (I guess that’s the plumping part of the name). I justified the price point of this product as a “treat myself” purchase, sometimes just having something with the label “luxury” helps with actually using the products and having a better routine for myself, but in the end I feel it’s very much worth the price. For as little as I use each night, I imagine this will last me a long time and it seems to have really turned my skin around."

I’m not particularly sensitive to fragrances but it is worth noting. It is also EXTREMELY oily and greasy. It felt disgusting to have on my face. I was hoping this would go away as I worked the product in however that did not happen. The cream remains oily and never really works into the skin how a cream should. It sort of just sits on top. It’s literally as if I applied an oil on my skin.   Overall this was not a good experience. I’m unsure if maybe I got some sort of defected cream. I see so many great reviews and was hoping to have a similar experience. I really did want to like this product and was even hoping on purchasing the full size but I’ve changed my mind.   Don’t purchase this without having tried it first."

I tried two drug store brands and didn’t like the results. I upped my price range and found a product that I still use as a back up but it wasn’t my ‘it’.  I decided to visit Sephora and was overwhelmed by all of the skincare products. I honestly chose Tacha because of the display. It looked luxurious and classy. There were two formulas that i was interested in but the Dewy cream costs less.  I don’t use any specific facial wash or serums. My simple face routine is the Tacha Dewy cream along with Olehenriksen banana eye cream. These products have completely turned my skin around. I get compliments on my skin all the time. I’m even accused of wearing foundation on the days I’m not wearing any.  NOW, when you first put the cream on, it looks greasy aka ‘dewy’. But don’t fret. It melts into the skin leaving a soft healthy hydrated glow. A little goes a long way.  I was too excited when I found out it was this year's birthday gift. The sample consistency is not the same as the jar you purchase but i have gotten the same exact results. The full size cream has a thinner velvety consistency. The sample size was more of a balm texture.  I feel like i found my ‘it’ product. I have no desire to try anything new."

This is actually one of the few heavier creams that I can use daily without breaking out. I avoided Tatcha products for the longest time, the price and reviews stating they weren’t great considering the price. There is something about them, they give a noticeable hydration and glow to the skin. I don’t need to apply much of this cream, the jar always lasts a very long time.

At it's price point I was expecting a lot more, but I honestly don't see much of a positive difference. *I have pretty normal skin that can get dry patches if my eczema is flaring up or if it's cold outside but I also lean combo in the summer.* I tried to use only the dewy skin cream twice a day (with cleansing and toning) but I found it was too drying to use at night so I opted to use it during the day with a heavier cream at night because it was causing my skin to peel around my nose and forehead, as well as cause more dryness overall. I only got one or two pimples while using this, but that may have been for hormonal reasons. The most effective way to apply this (for me) was by cleansing and toning, then waiting a few minutes and wetting my hands with water to apply about a dime sized amount to my face by pressing it in. That was the only way I could actually get this to sink in, probably from the HA in it. I really can't justify the price point but I feel this product may be much better for people with very oily/combo skin, and there is a light citrusy fragrance but nothing overpowering so if you're sensitive to fragrance it's not too heavy especially if you like citrus scents like me (lol). Overall, not my cup of tea."

But when I looked into it, the complaints were from women who had acne issues. This is NOT a good moisturizer for acne prone skin.  However, it is AMAZING FOR DRY SKIN.  I have always been complimented for my beautiful skin, but that's because I have always taken care of it. For years I used Chanel and LaMer products. At about age 45, I started using Clarins Double Serum (which I *still* swear by).  After trying a sample of Tatcha's The Dewy Skin Cream, I realized that it worked just as well, but cost a fraction of what Chanel's Le Lift or La Mer's Creme de la Mer. I switched and haven't looked back. I'm nearly 60 and I still have people compliment me on my beautiful skin and who are shocked when they hear my age. I have a simple routine: removing my eye makeup with Lancome's Bi-facil, rinsing my face with water and a washcloth (and occasionally using micellar water), drying it and adding a small dollop of Clarin's Double Serum, and in winter, following with this Tatcha moisturizer.   My skin is reactive, tending to Rosaceae. I am very pale (Irish descent) and burn easily (followed by freckles). I also tend to have dry skin."

I first got the $25 travel set as a trial pack, and WOW did it have more product in it than I thought it would. The two tiny containers lasted me 3 weeks. More than enough time to see how my skin would handle the new skincare routine. I wash and moisturize my face twice a day and I’ve seen a tremendous improvement to my skin. I would have bright red breakouts on my chin, all over my jaw, cheeks, in between my eyebrows, my forehead and hairline. I have had a pimple maybe once in the past few weeks now? I do have scarring and some discoloration from years of picking at my poor skin—so I will be looking for a spot treatment for any pop-up zits and dark spots, BUT! I love this stuff. A little goes a long way and it’ll last you forever. The moisturizer smells good, has a nice feeling, dries quickly and has your skin feelings so incredibly soft. I was worried since this is a “dewy” moisturizer but I’m less oily after using this moisturizer than if I used an oil-free or gel based one as I have in the past. Nourishing and moisturizing without leaving your skin feeling oily or greasy. I’m just so happy I finally found something that worked! Totally worth the money, I buy this stuff maybe once every 2 or 3 months? Yes, it will last you that long. I just wanted to share in case someone also struggling with combo-oily, acne-prone skin was feeling iffy based on the reviews. Try the travel size! Your skin deserves it. <3"

I have tried different moisturizers over the past couple years with never results like this as I would have irritation as the different lines would be either too rich, have properties that would cause breakouts or even worse dry my skin out even more.   My skin has changed in the past five years from oily combination screen to dry rosacea break outs and some fine lines. I tried the cleanser from this line with the combination of this moisturizer but found the cleanser stripped moisturizer from my skin so for me it was not a good combination.  My skin was just ok but didn’t feel great and felt dry.   I really loved this moisturizer though and knew there must be a cleanser  that is milder but yet soothing for my acne rosacea skin that would be complimentary with this moisturizer.  I lucked out as after experimenting using  CeraVe SA cleanser and the Tatcha Dewy Skin Cream moisturizer found it was a winning combination. Must be the ceramides & salicylic acid in the cleanser that keeps the skin blemish free. The Tatcha moisturizer works beautifully after I cleanse my skin as it gives the bonus moisturizing plumping properties. My husband complimented my skin and and that made me feel so good that it is noticeable.  I’m happy as my skin feels healthy and youthful again."

I've also tried Clinique dramatically hydrating jelly and cerave which seems to help somewhat. With this cream being my last resort, I've tried it and it just soaked into my skin and my skin felt incredibility hydrating. It has been months since my skin felt completely hydrated. It does leave a super dewy look. A little really does go a long way. I feel like too much can contribute to pore clogging which I haven't experienced.  It looks well under my skin tint moisturizer but 1st allow this to settled into your skin before make up application. The reason why I removed a star is because I am not a fan of jar packing (although the packing is absolutely stunning), I do not like the the last 5 irritating ingredients at the bottom of list (listed on the packaging and tatcha website) which are: alcohol, fragrance, citral, limonene, and linalool. Although these ingredients do not irritated my skin personally, but overtime with repeated usage, I do not know what kind of affects this will have on my skin.  The fragrance is light and has a spa like smell. It is not overpowering and it do not linger. However the facial wash is quite strong. I've purchased this full size and will continue to use until otherwise my skin dislikes it."

The moisturizer glides on silky smooth and hydrates all day. My only complaint is that if you accidentally put too much on, it’s easy to start looking a little shiny on zoom calls. Works really well in conjunction with Caudalie’s perfecting serum."

The more I rubbed after 2 hours of wearing it, the more it started to come off. Made me feel bad for the people who paid full price for this. It's good BUT there's definitely better options out there that will actually stay on your skin. I even used it w the face wash to see its optimal results."

This is probably one of the most hydrating things I've used on my face, but it's not hugely irritating and fairly creamy (not heavy) for the amount of hydration it gives you.   I have very sensitive skin and this brand doesn't bother my skin.   The two products that seem to be the winners for my skin are this and Sulwhasoo's anti-aging First Care Serum.   I use the Tatcha oil Cleanser to take off my makeup, the Sulwhasoo serum after, and then this as my moisturizer.   The first picture is 6 hours after I put on my makeup with this moisturizer underneath and I used the Dewy Mist just for fun- I am not sure I even needed to use the Mist. The second picture is with my makeup off and after going thru my cleansing routine.   If you think these are good results and you're around my age, I'd try this.   P.S.   If you double cleanse and have sensitive skin like I do, be mindful. The oil cleanser is great, but I have noticed that double cleansing can be highly irritating- just my opinion with my own skin sensitivity and likely the age of my skin. If I just use the routine I listed above? Perfect."

I’ve tried everything. & I know people say that but I really mean it. Then I found a pic in the reviews of this product of someone with skin like mine that saw results so I took the plunge & decided to try it. I bought this moisturizer, the dewy serum & face wash along with the overnight cream. I decided to take a picture every morning in the same spot at the same time to see how this affects my skin & boy it’s made such a difference after only 6 days of use. More than any other product I’ve tried. If you suffer from dry & dull skin with redness just try this product. I never write reviews but I wanted to leave this here to maybe help someone who’s struggling with the same skin issues & is frustrated that nothing works. I get it. But just try this. It’s working for me. Pics are of my skin before using this & now six days later using the products morning & night.   I know the pics aren’t flattering & my face is puffy because it’s the morning but just focus on the skin ok? Lol"

After one day use, I broke out terribly, and the last time I had even one pimple was a least 3 years ago.

You'll wake up feeling like a different person, I kid you not. skin feels gooey and elasticky, feels amazing. similar price point for more product and MUCH better / noticeable results from the FIRST try. it's a professional product so Im not sure if it's available for everyone but if you can get your hands on it, dont hesitate. note: You cannot go into the sun with it on your face. it's really for night time / morning and wash off before being exposed to the sun.

I was apprehensive about this product because it is thicker and I tend to have oily skin, especially in my T zone. I have been using this nearly every day since early Feb (still lots left in my trial jar) and my skin has never looked and felt better. It is positively glowing! I have not had any breakouts like thick I have in the past with thick lotions, and didn't have any skin issues during my monthly cycle which can sometimes result in a small breakout. I tend to have rosy cheeks and don't like going out without at least foundation on to even out my skin tone. After using this for over a month, I don't even need foundation! This is the only change I have made in my skincare routine. It is dewy and leaves a glow. It does leave a shine, but it doesn't feel greasy to me."

It feels a bit heavy and greasy on my skin when applied, and it's fine when it's been absorbed, but my skin does not continue to feel moisturized for as long as it should. I also end up adding a drop of facial oil to my moisturizer before applying. Honestly since using this moisturizer my skin has gotten worse , more acne than I've had in years, Nothing else in my skincare routine has changed. Maybe this moisturizer would be good for me once i n a while but not a go to, so i wouldn't recommend it. many people like it, so it's not to say this isn't a good one. like i said, i liked the sample. but my skin then was clear and good overall."

This moisturizer has a slight sweet fragrance, I highly recommend it for people who normally dislike products with fragrance, it just leaves you smelling fresh, yet it is not overpowering what so ever. The price is quite shocking but it is well worth it since you only need to use a small amount to cover your face, it can last for up to 5 months with the standard size."

Most importantly, however, is the way my face felt after applying it—I wouldn’t say my skin is sensitive, but it definitely felt warm and prickly after applying it after my usual skincare products.

I was really shocked to see how thick it is, but it feels so silky like thick whipped cream. It adds a really nice glow to my face too.

I recommended the other one to my brother which also improved his oily skin. It easily absorbs into the skin and doesn't make it feel too heavy. sometimes I get small cuts in my face due to dryness and the moisturizer does not cause burning. However it can be irritating for me sometimes, it's mostly due to the scent. After my skin calms down from a reaction though, it's completely fine again. It definitely was the least negative reactive moisturizer I've used.  Purchased the 75 ml size this year in April and still have enough for the rest of this year. I'm sure the 50ml is perfect amount to use for almost an entire year (although it probably depends on how much you need and cover your face)"

I highly recommend this moisturizer if you find your skin is looking really dull and dry under makeup. It also gives a really nice plumping effect, but unfortunately that's only temporary.

However I recently moved and my skin became drier than ever, with flakes and dry patches that weren’t going away, even with the addition of La Roche Posey Cicaplast Baume and REN Recovery Balm. This Tatcha moisturizer worked and helped my skin on first use, better than the others. I would only use this for dry or dehydrated skin. I have sensitive skin that’s acne prone, and this hasn’t broken me out. I’ve already repurchased during the winter sale in a gift set as I don’t want to be without this for the coldest months."

I learned the hard way that I always need to try a product before buying and I can instantly tell if it’s going to irritate me or not.

For people who have reactive dry skin, try a product with toleriane or toleridine in it : Laroche-Posay or Bioderma. You can use it daily, alterne it with the dewy cream. Tatcha alone reduces the pain, the pulling sensation and irritation that my face has by it's own, but I do use both and see a major difference.   A little bit goes A LONG WAY.

The kind of shine you’d expect from a soccer mom of 4 running late, no coffee, no gas and a lost wallet - sweat shine.  Not best.  Plus side? You won’t smell as sweaty as you’ll look - the light scent is pleasant.   For the price point, not worth it."

After, I experienced issues that made me miss my pre-cancer skin.  Radiation brought on serious dryness issues and sensitivity and GVHD breakouts took away any hope of stability between the dryness bouts. I have been dedicated to using only Arbonne products for years, but suddenly, nothing was helping. I was going through cycles of horrible painful and itchy cystic breakouts, immediately followed by a mass peeling event. This lasted for the more than two years after transplant. After changing which Arbonne line I was using multiple times, to no avail, I decided it might be an intolerance to a common ingredient as it happened with all products, not just one.  I bought this magic cream based on the reviews alone, and I'm never buying another.  Within 24 hours the peeling had stopped and hasn't returned.  I haven't had a single GVHD breakout.  I go bare-skinned during the day now with confidence, when I NEVER left the house without at least a CC cream in the past - including before cancer.  This cream will always be in my routine now."

The aesthetic is beautiful but a jar packaging is really unhygienic. I’ve used this every night for two months and I probably have another month left however I noticed the texture of the cream looks different than when I first got it. It looks more watery and less whipped in the jar now but still applies and wears the same.. it probably changed texture because it’s exposed to air every time I open it which is why I prefer a tube or airless pump. For the price I’m not thrilled, I will stick to other moisturizers that don’t have perfume because it made my face more red as well. There are better heavy creams with far better ingredients out there, But I knew all the possible issues before I bought it so I won’t hold that against tatcha. I would not recommend this. It’s a basic heavy moisturizer to me."

The moisture lasts ALL DAY and ALL NIGHT long. You can wear it under makeup and on its own. Everybody that I know has told me that my skin looks better and glowy since I started using this, and they don’t even know I began using a new product, they just see massive differences in my complexion.   My skin feels so soft, it is plumping up like crazy! My under eye hallows are almost completely gone and my smile lines have decreased insanely much. My entire complexion as a whole is just better and more youthful looking.  This is very thick and may not be suitable for oily people or acne prone skin, due to just how hydrating it is.

I let it sink in for at least an hour before sleeping because it’s so dewy. The rest of the week I use Tatcha Water Cream because it’s lighter. Personally I absolutely love this product. A little goes a long way & surprisingly it doesn’t have an overpowering smell that triggers my very sensitive scent allergies. I’m in my 30’s now & have been using anti aging skincare since I was in my early teens - premature aging isn’t something I’ve ever wanted. They say the skin gets drier & duller as we age (which is why I added this to my nighttime routine) & it’s been doing pretty well now for almost a year - in terms of keeping my skin moisturized. Dryness isn’t an issue for me, but dullness can be if I slack for a few days (covid lazy lul). Anyway, I highly recommend at least trying this out. The price tag is high, but I believe the shelf life is 12mo (?) so really it’s not expensive once a year if you think about it."

When I got the Water Cream sample it lasted me almost a month. The full size lasted a little over six months. And that’s using it twice a day. The size of a pearl like they suggest (okay, okay, maybe my “pearl size” is more like freshwater pearl sized).  So, if you buy it. And you’re disappointed because your skin flip flops between oily, dry, combo, and acne...but you’re drier than Death Valley in the middle of summer, it makes a nice lightweight moisturizer for everywhere else."

I have sensitive skin. My skin is acne prone, itchy and really red. I only need a little bit of this product to soothe the redness and stop the itching. My skin feels soft and plump.  However, if I use too much, I will break out because my skin already has enough oil (anything of too much can be bad at times). So, I only need dime size and it works. Fortunately, this product will last me two months because of how little I need to use it on a daily bases.  In the past, I have used so many moisturizers from drug store to high end brands and they all had terrible effects on me. Some caused severe break outs, others made my skin itch and caused uneven texture (the little red bumps) or left an ugly residue on my face. Other times the smell of the products would give me headaches. I tried tons and all left me feeling miserable about my skin.  I keep coming back to this product. It's beautifully packaged. The texture of the creme is lovely. It blends well with other products such as face washes ( biossance, first aid beauty) and makeup. I will be looking into other Tatcha products.  It's pricey but it last in my case it last quite a while."

Here’s why...  Even during the winter months, when I’d get SUPER DRY skin without using this moisturizer, this was still too heavy of a moisturizer. So much that I had to alternate every other day to a lighter one.   For me, regardless of how I’d incorporate this moisturizer into my previous beauty routine, it really didn’t agree with my combination, hormonal cystic acne prone skin. I trialed an entire 1.7 oz and had daily cystic breakouts throughout the entire time I was trialing this.  Now, I’m using CeraVe PM Moisturizer with Niacinamide to fade all my previously earned acne scars and control oil. For me, the CereVe PM works like a dream and I’ve been using it for 3 weeks now with no breakouts!  Bottomline, everyone has their own unique skincare needs. This is a very high priced moisturizer. Packaging is beautiful, scent is YUM, but it just wasn’t a good fit for me."

The CONS: I had to find just the perfect amount that works for my skin thru trial & error otherwise my extra product is so hard for my skin to absorb & my skin was greasy. I have really dry skin so at first it didn’t bother me. BUT THEN I noticed depending on which sunscreen/primer combo I use after this moisturizer, it always pills !!!!! ALWAYS!  It was hard for me to find a  Combination of my products that works well with this. Considering the price (for even the small size!!), you’d expect having no issues at all with this. But nope. I do still use it at night sometimes on days when I’m feeling extra dry but I have completely stopped using this as a daytime moisturizer because it’s just too heavy, doesn’t absorb well into my skin, and doesn’t always interact well with my other products. So there’s my review and no, I won’t be purchasing this again."

Its very perfumed which isnt good to apply onto your skin as well as it made my skin really bumpy, some break outs and a lot of build up i could feel under. as soon as i stopped using it my skin started getting better again. going back to ole henrickson. dont let the cute packaging play you a fool. Lockdown in toronto made it hard to return so now i just use it for my dry elbows and knees"

My face rejected it, and to be quite honest there are other moisturizers out there that do a way better job at moisturizing than this. The fragrance was too overpowering to start, big no no for sensitive skin. Consistency was good but left a slight hot feeling to my face after applied. Other reasons for a low score, it didn’t sink in well enough and my face didn’t feel as hydrated compared to other moisturizers I’ve used. My acne was also not a fan. I would say if you are looking for dewy completion go with using a hyaluronic acid under your fav moisturizer, let it sink in, then pump in some more hyaluronic acid  to your moisturizer, mix apply to face and then either spray the dewy spray or pat and press a light weight oil on your face."

Anything you apply over it will slide around or come off in patches because of this.  I ended up using it at night and was still unimpressed with the moisturizing properties.  It wasn't even just ok, it was horrible.  I honestly can't believe people like this."

I put it on 6 hours ago and my face still feels like I rubbed oil all over it 6 minutes ago. I tried rubbing it in, multiple times, but it’s going nowhere. It doesn’t feel like I have a thick cream on or anything like that. Just literal oil. It’s strange. And it unfortunately didn’t seem to absorb even my dry areas.   If your skin is at all oily, anything other than super dry actually, I would probably give this a pass. Or buy the sample size like I did to try it out first."

I exclusively was using drunk elephant products at the time and like the line until winter came around my skin so dry even though I would have combination in early skin during the summer but because I should get older your body changes I decided I need to up my regimen. I don’t do Botox I’m not against it but it’s just not my thing. I have done chemical peels Which has been helpful but are quite expensive and require a lot of prep no working out not get a massage at least a week before and after. So using this product along with the oil in the cleansing oil I have to say it’s my new favorite thing. Of course I love the scent of hyacinth. Yes oil is a little pricey. It’s on par with some of the high-end products. But with the 15% off and I’m about to get 20% off I decided to splurge.I always was a believer in you get what you pay for and when you invest in your skin which is the largest organ if your body and you take care of it you will see the results. So girls go for it splurge on yourself why not you deserve it."

I started with a sample size, liked how it felt and have since used 3 containers of this stuff. I love it. The texture is almost exactly the same as the CeraVe cream you can get almost anywhere, but this feels like it stays on your skin a lot longer. It has a very soft scent to it, I don't know if it's an added fragrance or just how the product smells, but it's nearly unnoticeable and personally I find it pleasant.  Pros; Very hydrating. You can layer just about anything under it and it won't pill up. It's thick and perfect to use before bed. My skin is very sensitive and this hasn't given me any issues. It's not sticky, and it doesn't really dry down in the sense that it feels like it keeps my skin hydrated until I wash my face in the morning again. Unlike the Indigo cream, it doesn't leave any sort of color cast despite the purple color of the lotion. I'm pretty fair so the Indigo cream makes me look blue, but this doesn't change my skin color at all.  Cons; It doesn't sit well under makeup for me. It pills a little bit if I put anything drying over it like powder or sunscreen, so I actually don't use this is the morning if I plan on using any sort of foundation (I don't use foundation often so this isn't a problem for me, but I felt it was worth mentioning. If I do plan on foundation, I actually use their water cream.) Another is the price point, I really recommend buying the little sample size to test out first to see if it's for you. A little goes a long way, their sample size lasted me about 5 days of using it day and night, but it's still about $25 if I remember it correctly. The packaging it also deceiving, and the container takes up a lot of space."

I’ve tried COUNTLESS moisturizers and nothing gives me as much of a dewy but not greasy glow. I eventually splurged for the 2.5 Oz of this and was super excited to try it. It definitely gives such a beautiful base for makeup, and feels so rich. However, I find that it can feel very oily and heavy. Normally I prefer this, as I have used cerave cream & other thick moisturizers in the past, but this product felt unbearably heavy on my skin. The scent was very noticeable too in my opinion, and I typically do not have a problem with fragrances in my skincare. Although I think it would work well for people who truly love a heavy feeling cream, I would stay away and opt for other moisturizers meant for dry skin."

I apply this one nightly and it moisturizes my skin like no other. In the morning, my skin is so plump, soft and I still have a small residue of the moisturizer. I would recommend everyone that can to save up and splurge later on this one if they have dry skin because you can really tell that you’re applying a quality product to your skin."

At first i thought it was because of my sunscreen (that I have used with this in the past) so I tried without sunscreen and it still happened. I tried without a drop of oil (my skin is dehydrated so I find that helps) and it still happened. Maybe I got a bad batch or something, but I will likely not purchase this again since at that price, it should be perfect.

This seems a bit expensive for such a small amount of the moisturizer. This face cream absorbs into the skin well, and there isn’t necessarily anything “bad” about it. However, I much prefer The Silk Cream because it absorbs into the skin better and is slightly lighter. The Dewy Cream leaves your skin a little shiny/glowy, so this may be a good face cream for those searching for a winter moisturizer or those with dry skin."

This is a lightweight but heavy moisturizer. Meaning if you have normal to dry skin like I do, it needs something extra and this delivers everything that I need. It offers such a beautiful glow underneath my makeup and my makeup doesn't slip or move around. Winters in New England are tough for my skin this time of years and using this, I have had zero dry patches.

I have combination leaning more towards oily skin; however, due to wearing masks and just cold weather certain parts of my skin became very dry to the point of being flaky! Never had experienced that ever! I tried so many hydrating products and nothing helped until this! After using it two weeks consistently no more dry patches. It smells amazing and I find that a little goes a long way."

I gave it 2 stars because it does give you a dewy glow, not 100% sold on the “plumping”  I think the only time I would use this on my face would be if I had extra dry skin and I was about to go out in the dry cold for an extended period of time (ie skiing or snowshoeing), I would imagine in that scenario it would be great at protecting you skin from chapping.

It has helped the dry skin on my cheeks & around my mouth (p.s. I am 25, I use it in combo with their enzymatic exfoliant and rice wash - I have good things to say about these products). Why I am rating 'The Dewy Skin Cream' lower is because I purchased it exactly a year to date, I have used it sparingly due to price and because I didn't need such a rich moisturizer in the humidity of summer 2020! I store the product in my bedroom away from sunlight, I seal it tightly each time but have noticed the product EVAPORATES. I have lost HALF the container in the time I have owned it and so over the past few months of this fall/winter I have tried to use it up. I started noticing around the 3-4 month mark that it was going quickly but I was most disappointed with it not being due to use. I still recommended this product  but TATCHA please fix the packaging so we can get all the content we purchase. If you purchase it you may need to use it quickly and if you used it generously daily, my estimation is it would last you around 6 months. Thanks for reading!"

Seriously, a pea size amount will cover your whole face and blended down into the neck area. I apply once in the morning, and a little bit more liberally at night and add some to my lips. I adore this cream and will be purchasing whenever I run out, which looks like it will be a while! Also, it comes with a little scooper on the top of the cap so you can measure out a pea size amount for your face, and so that you’re not sticking your fingers into the jar and contaminating it. So clever and this stuff smells WONDERFUL!"

After trying a few different ones, I finally decided to try this one, the Dewy Skin Cream Plumping & Hydrating Moisturizer, and was instantly impressed.   It’s important to listen to your own skin and my skin definitely liked this product. It’s the only moisturizer that kept my skin soft and hydrated all day long. With other moisturizers, I would have to reapply during the day because my skin was dying of thirst. I don’t have that problem now because this product is great at keeping my skin happy.  Also, a little goes a long way! At first, my skin looked too shiny because I was accidentally applying too much. This was because that was exactly what I had to do with the other moisturizers. After I figured out what the right amount was, my skin looked great!   So why didn’t I give it 5 stars? Truth be told, I think this is wayyyy to expensive for a moisturizer. In fact, if I end up finding another moisturizer that makes my skin happy like this and is cheaper, I will definitely switch over. As good as this product is, I do think that $68 is a lot.   If the price works for you though, I still highly recommend it!"

It is also formulated with quite a bit of fragrance which makes it smell nice. I don't need fragrance though. The package and feel of the cream is spot on, but as far as effectiveness, I'd stick with something else. A bit overhyped for the pricepoint and effectiveness."

Wonderful to protect your cream from bacteria, and not lose the applicator in the process!   The cream glides on with a beautiful smoothness and feels luxurious and instantly soothing. Be careful! A little goes quite a long way!   There is a light, fresh, almost milky like scent, that instantly disappeared.   I use lactic acids and retinoids daily and this product helped keep my skin soft and minimized dryness. The cream played well with my current skin care routine.   Did work well with daytime makeup, if you use the cream sparingly. Looks dewy and gorgeous on bare skin.   I have not used this cream as long as I have my normal products, so I cannot vouch for the long term benefits, but I will update. I have favorite night cream (which also has algae), but found this cream much more hydrating, if it performs as well as my other, it may knock it out of my line up, at least in the winter.   My husband has oily skin and large pores, but still likes this cream when applied at night. I thought it really plumped his skin. Probably not good for day time oily skin.   #Tatcha #DewySkin #Hydrating #Cream #Clean #CrueltyFree"

I’m prone to red, painful, dry patches on my face. I used to put oil AND a moisturizer on in the morning, but by noon, my nose and forehead would look like a snake shedding its skin. Not a good look especially with makeup on.. I randomly added a sample of this moisturizer to my cart when purchasing a lipstick. I had super low expectations because I’ve tried it all.. I was genuinely shocked when I put it on and immediately had to buy the biggest size. My skin has never been this moisturized for the entire day. I’ve also never seen my skin be dewy. Ever. Only crusty and dusty. This moisturizer is a game changer. It has a very gentle scent, not overpowering and doesn’t irritate my sensitive skin. It’s not oily and doesn’t make you look greasy. Start with a tiny bit and give it time to absorb before putting on makeup (comes with a spatula attached to the lid). I would probably not recommend it for oily or normal skin as I could see it being too heavy. But if your skin is parched and flaky, you will try it once and throw your money at this product for the rest of your life. I promise."

I’m not a fan of dimethicone because it stops the product from penetrating the skin and that’s good with makeup but with my skincare I want every ingredient that can protect my skin barrier. The gold can be sensitizing to the skin so beware of that if you have sensitive skin and the minor fragrance that is added but it’s nothing too bad it’s far on the ingredients list so it does not cause sever irritation or any for myself. I have dry skin so this actually really saved me during these winter nights and the dry patches I get are always a problem but with this in my collection I feel saved. I recommend this for dry skin to dry combo. Definitely not friendly to oily skin types."

			"review_text": "(3) points:  (1) The cream itself is PURPLE - I LOVE this although I don't know why really....it just makes it fun to use. (2) The cream is heavily fragranced. I don't find the fragrance pleasing and would prefer a cream that is unscented. (3) It leaves a residue on your face - hence marketed as a dewy skin cream. I prefer Biossance's Squalane & Omega Repair Cream also sold here on Sephora as a deep moisturizer (unscented) for a cream that is also dewy. The packaging is much less jazzy but I consider it to be the better cream of the two.  BOTTOM-LINE: Heavily fragranced purple cream in very pretty packaging, that leaves a reside (dewy). Competent cream but there are better IMO.  3.5 stars out of 5."

This feels decadent and hydrating but dries down to a luxuriously soft matte feel. And I swear my skin looks instantly more youthful. I bought the full size as soon as my sample ran out and literally counted the days down until it arrived. Definitely worth trying out to see if it’s for you and if you do love it I think it’s well worth the price. Plus the packaging and box it comes in are their own amazing experience."

I usually need something as thick as a balm to make my face truly feel moisturizer but I don’t want to walk around all day with something that thick on my face (especially during summer) so I usually settle for a less moisturizing, thinner cream. This is the first cream that actually moisturizes my face without feeling too thick or oily. My mom and husband both have normal-oily skin and both love it. It always is perfect under make up because it creates a smooth but grippy surface almost like a primer."

But more importantly, it feels like there’s small pieces of plastic in it. If I rub it in my hands for a few secs, it goes away but I only noticed because I went to put it on my face and felt the hard/kinda sharp pieces. I have no idea what would cause that.  There was no way it could have been from something on my hands because I wash my hands and go through several steps before getting to moisturizing"

However, after about two weeks of regular use I’ve realized that the issue of product pilling on my face I’ve been noticing recently is 100% caused by this product. It isn’t incredibly moisturizing for me, and that seems to be because the product sits on the top of my skin and doesn’t sink in. I can wear it at night but I cannot wear it under makeup because it pills on application. I have been applying it after cleansing and a simple serum, with SPF over top.

Sure the price tag is high but if used properly it will last, remember more is not always better but a waste of product. I believe a good portion of the price accounts for the Boujee packaging that makes the purchase of this product feel like you received something special and extra. I love it!!! Definitely worth a try!!!"

I'm not a huge fan of the ingredients or price personally but the only real potential downside (if any) is that it does sit on top of the skin so if you don't like feeling your moisturizer, then this might not be for you.

It's been over 3 hours since applying and it still hasn't sunk into my skin and has made it overly oily and tacky (I used a very small amount   - little goes a long way). This cream is meant for someone with very dry dry dry skin. I would not recommend this for normal, oily or combo skin, or for summer use. It smells lovely and love the purple. I think I will try the silk cream to see if that balances things out. If you have dry skin, I recommend this product."

The cream feels very smooth going on but that’s it, it just sits on top of your face. It does not truly penetrate the skin. I used the back of my hand and tapped my forehead and it looks oily or as the description says “healthy glow.”As if I need those blotting papers. I have given this product a couple weeks to see if there would be any improvement, hoping each time it will miraculously work but it has failed. So if anyone is on the fence like I was, and you read the reviews that have said they have dry skin and this doesn’t work, it’s the truth. Save your money and try something else.

I don't think I have sensitive skin and I wish I could pinpoint what the problem could be. A Sephora employee thought it could possibly be a reaction to the green tea or silicone content. I was surprised since this has great quality ingredients. It does smell nice and makes the skin look hydrated, but after trying this a second time and having more breakouts, I've had to give up on using it. I did have good results with the Tatcha Water Cream and Tarte Baba Bomb moisturizer without any reaction."

I will be returning this for something that can moisturize with a more matte finish. It's such a bummer but understandable that we can no longer try products on in the store or get samples to take home and try before buying. If I had a chance to try first I wouldn't have purchased this. Very beautiful packaging though and a light pleasant fragrance."

It has a mild fragrance that I actually find quite pleasant, and absorbs into the skin really well. It doesn’t leave any weird texture behind and caused no irritation or breakouts. After finishing the travel size and getting through most of my full size jar I can say with confidence that my skin has never felt so plump and healthy.

I've been hearing people rave and rave about this product for quite a long time, and it definitely had my interest especially because I have a dry skin type and tend to love anything that claims to be dewy. However, when I investigated further and discovered that the price tag on this guy is $68 (for a pretty standard size of 1.7 oz!), I definitely started to second guess whether I really *needed* to give this product a try or not. I gave it some time and consideration, but found myself always coming back to it and constantly adding and removing it from my Sephora cart, so eventually I just decided to go ahead and finally splurge on this pricey moisturizer to find out what all the hype was about. And I must say I've been pleasantly surprised! I was a lil worried that the word 'dewy' was in the product's name solely for marketing purposes and that it wouldn't translate to being actually dewy-looking, especially on my dry skin. But I was mistaken! This moisturizer is luxuriously moisturizing and definitely does its name justice in the dewy department. And, luckily, the seemingly mediocre 1.7oz of product you get actually goes a long way because you truly only need to use a very, very small amount of this moisturizer to reap its benefits. I find myself using about half of the amount of product I'd typically use with most moisturizers when I use this particular product. Which leads me to my next topic, which would be whether or not I think the Tatcha Dewy Skin Cream is worth its high price: to that I say that, honestly, it depends! If you have a drier skin type, tend to love any product that claims to be 'dewy,' and can appreciate the bougie details like the luxe packaging and subtle but refined scent of Tatcha products, then I think it's definitely worth it to look deeper into the idea of purchasing this moisturizer to give a try for yourself! If not, then it might not be for you!"

I have dry sensitive skin, and this product did not break me out nearly as much as other new products that I try. Leaves the skin feeling baby soft- even in winter months.  Enjoyable subtle scent.  leaves behind a dewy, 6 hour glow.  Tightens skins. Works fantastic overnight and during the day. I feel pretty when I wear this.  Cons:  The stick feels cheap. The packaging should be biodegradable or returnable (it is reusable) because recycling is not good enough to make an environmental difference.  Does not work well for targeting areas, due to the dewiness of the cream, the difference between bare skin and product application is noticeable.  It is not weightless. I notice that it sits on my skin during the day- like a light filmy texture.   This is a luxury product through and through, my product lasted 6 months with consistent application. I don't find this product practical, however, it's a nice pick-me-up or gift if you're like me and sometimes uses objects to fill the void in your life."

But after two weeks of use, I noticed I was getting a few pimples. I never break out anymore so I thought it was maybe a weird hormone thing. I also noticed I that my skin was getting very pink on my cheeks and nose and that after applying I’d get itchy. This is the only new product I’ve used so it must be causing it. Then I went back to the reviews and read the 1-2 star ones. I wish I had read them before buying. Reviews stated exactly what I’m experiencing. I also learned it has dimethicone and myristyl mysristate as major ingredients. I never would have bought it knowing that. Both of these will cause irritation and breakouts. I falsely assumed because it’s a “clean” product it wouldn’t have these. I’ll have to make sure to check the ingredients on the “clean” products as closely as the normal ones from now on."

This stuff has a shelf life of only 6 months! Unfortunately the texture has changed after time and I cannot use it anymore.

It effectively moisturizes both the oily and drier areas of my skin, applies and is absorbed like a dream, the light fragrance is pleasant, not overpowering, and doesn't irritate my sensitive skin.  I apply this at night, and also occasionally before make-up if my skin feels dry.  No issue applying make up on this.  Leaves skin with a naturally radiant finish!

Finally during the last sale I caved, and it’s now my absolute favorite product in my routine. I use it right after Truth Serum as the last step in my morning skincare, and I have never seen my skin so radiant, fresh, and bright. My skin feels bouncy and I honestly sometimes skip makeup all together because it looks so amazing. A little bit goes a long way, definitely a lot further than some of the other moisturizers I was using like GlamGlow."

My skin also used to be acne prone but I’ll maybe get 1 or 2 pimples every two months now. My skin was feeling particularly dry the day I used this. I love The Water Cream so I figured this could be a better option during the winter months. I used a very small amount and it felt like I’d slathered my face in Vaseline. After only a few hours, I noticed 2 or 3 cystic zits pop up and it clogged my pores. Nothing else was different about my skincare routine that day aside from this. It just felt gross.

			"review_text": "So I suffer from eczema and dry skin, specifically in the top right side of of my face. When I first tried this, I had already run out of my past holy grail moisturizer (due to the pandemic), so my skin was dry and cracking in some parts and I was relying on hydrocortisone. I have been using a hyaluronic acid serum underneath my moisturizer so I used that first and my skin soaked it up. I used tatcha right street and immediately my son loved it! I was super scared that where my skin was kinda cracked it would burn like crazy, and instead it felt like it calmed it down. My skin did feel dewy and plump, which it super hard to come by, because some moisturizers feel oily out watery, but this one feels thick and it goes on smooth. When I first opened it I was afraid of the fragrance and feared for my skin, but it honestly did not effect me in any way. I put Supergoop’s sunscreen unseen on top before going out in the morning and they mixed well! Even when I did sweat a bit (bc of Texas heat) I didn’t feel oily or sticky, my skin just felt normal and still very plump. Immediately from the start you could see a difference in my dry patch of eczema. You couldn’t see the flakyness (in fact it shedded off painlessly) and where I had small abrasions it did not burn at all!! Do I think you should get this if you have oily skin? Probably not, simply because you might not like there dewy feel on top of that. I have super sensitive skin that breaks out almost immediately after using something that my skin doesn’t like and so far I don’t see anything wrong. Stuff with a fragrance usually makes me break out, but after seeing all the hype about this product, it got me curious to try it. I will say that the product does kinda sit on your face for a while, which has never happened to me because my skin usually soaks it all up, but I feel like that’s what it’s supposed to do in order to provide the right hydration. All in all, I LOVE this product!"

			"review_text": "Dewy Skin Cream is successful in creating a dewy complexion, but calling it a cream feels almost misleading. It has the thickness of a cream, the weight of a balm, and the drag of a heavy, dry gel. My immediate thought was aerated (non-)petroleum jelly—it has its uses, but isn't something I necessarily want on my face. While I can't definitively identify the cream as the cause, I have experienced a mild breakout along the jaw and a looming, mid-face pimple (from someone who may get 2–3 per year, at best). I planned to use this product in the morning to take advantage of its cosmetic effects (and preferring something more technical for sleep), but I have little desire wear it in any mix of heat or humidity, especially with sunscreen layered on. If used at night product, I'd suggest a generous time allowance for absorption before potentially touching face to pillow. I'll try mixing sparingly with my preferred creams to make the texture palatable and maintain some of the effect, but Dewy Skin Cream is off the repurchase list. Beautifully packaged, unnecessarily fragranced."

			"review_text": "First, I am a 25 year old woman with combination skin. My face gets slightly oily in my T zone in the warmer months and then leans more towards dry in the cooler months.   TLDR: This cream did not work for my skin but my mother who has dull, dry skin loves it. She says it makes her skin feel nice and natural.   I received a travel size of this in a set, and it didn't really work for my skin. I currently also have the water cream, and my skin seems to like that much better. Compared to the water cream, this cream is much thicker and doesn't spread as well. The water cream spreads more like a light gel moisturizer, which I prefer, while this cream is heavy and doesn't quite absorb or spread easily. I put this on at night after cleansing with the purple gentle rice polish (which I do recommend the rice polishes btw) and it felt sticky on my skin. In the morning, my skin did feel moisturized but my face was shiny, as if it didn't really absorb. And to be honest, it feels really gross on my skin and makes me want to wash my face immediately. I will say this didn't break me out or irritate my skin though.   Before I realized I didn't like this cream, I had ordered a jar for my mom for mother's day. She is over 60 and describes her skin as dull, dry, and sensitive. Also, she is allergic to most fragrances and pretty much everything else on the planet. She loved this cream and said it was really moisturizing. Between this cream and the purple gentle rice polish, she says, a lot of that stuff (even good stuff) leaves my skin feeling unnatural  - sometimes tight and dry from cleansers and moisturizers tend to feel like they're definitely there. These products left my skin feeling nice and natural. So far, my mother has not experienced any irritation etc.   So with that, I will say this cream did not work for me but worked well for my mom. If you have dryer, sensitive skin, it's worth trying the travel size (I project the travel size will last 1+ months)."

I waited for a sale and ended up getting 20% off. After trying it for 2 months i can honesty say i don’t see myself ever living without this again.  This is an amazing cream and works so well for my dry skin. So many foundations would clean to my dry patches and this helps for that not to happen. I am obsessed. I can use this with one without make up which is even better. A little bit goes a really long way so it will last you a good amount of time. The only thing I kind of don’t like is the fact that it only has a 6 month shelf life. But i can get passed that because of how amazing it is."

I do have dry and sensitive skin, it did not make me break out , but also it is NOT anti aging and it does not get rid of fine lines and wrinkles . It does what it says, dewy and glow skin. Which basically I don’t need glow if I’m trying to get rid of wrinkles.  I will not be repurchasing this brand anymore. There’s plenty of other ones that work way better than this."

The cream has a light purple tint and a mild scent that disappear when you apply it to your face. The texture is quite thick, so I recommend taking a pea size amount and rubbing it between your palms to warm up the product before applying to your face. It does make your face look dewy upon application but I haven’t noticed any improvement in my skin with continued use."

A friend of mine had the dewy cream and when we were on vacation together, I used hers everyday. I was obsessed. I bought it immediately and haven't stopped since. This moisturizer feels like luxury on your skin. It is so rich but does not feel too heavy. Even with my oily t zone, I have no issues with this. I use it at night and days when I am home all day (ie not outside in the sun bc i have spf for that) During this quarentine season, I have been using this day and night, and its such a treat. I will cleanse, use my AHA toner, then a serum, then top off with my dewy skin. If I had to pick one moisturizer only for the rest of time, this would be it."

At 29 years old I was beyond embarrassed of my skin since I had worked so hard to maintain clear skin! I immediately stopped using it and my skin started to clear up, however, Tatcha's customer service was literally amazing!! Which is why I am giving the product 3 stars. I was able to return the product and exchange it for the water crem which was 100% better for my skin type. I still love Tatcha, this product was just not made for acne prone skin!"

So long story short, I tried the water cream when it was all the rage, it worked ok at first, but the smell started to get to me (I was fine before but I started hating the scent for some reason) and I started breaking out when I was halfway through the jar. I’ve used a fair amount of Tatcha products, love the rice polish and the cleansers. So few years later I decided to try Tatcha again and I bought a mini size of this cream. I used it in conjunction with a sample size of tatchas vitamin c serum.. my face was instantly transformed, I was starting to develop premature signs of aging and lines, I’m close to 30 by the way. The lines were smoother out, my face felt much better and hydrated and sunspots were actually brightening up. I’ll rave about the vitamin c serum in another review. Also forgot to mention I’m also using this in conjunction with the Tatcha essence /SKII essence depending on which one I reach for. But no reactions to this cream, my skin loves it compared to the water cream. And I feel a lot more hydrated and happy with this one as well.

I bought the small size of this product to give it a try because tatcha is basically the gucci of skin care, we’ve all seen Jeffree Star use it. I have to say that this product is absolutely amazing for spoiling yourself. Something that turns me off of tatcha products is the heavy amount of fragrance, however I think it’s alright to splurge on this because it really is a relaxing and luxurious experience. The product feels amazing in the skin it’s thick and rich it smells like citrus. Overall I have to give it a good rating, not for the price, not for the effectiveness, but for the fun experience I had with it."

It appears to clog my pores, and sometimes my face gets a bit heated and pink. When I wake up, though, my skin looks bright and healthy and my skin texture is more even. Not sure what is causing the reaction as it is brief and only happens upon initial application. Overall, would recommend, but maybe not to someone with sensitive or acne-prone skin as the consistency is a bit thick compared to moisturizers I've enjoyed in the past."

I tried it at night with my regular products. Same thing. Greasy and peeled a ton but in the morning my face would feel smooth and look more even. My pillow didn’t love the excess product. I’ve tried it without any extra products...same ol peeling. I finally just decided to rub the excess product and peeling off and I got the best results with dewy non-greasy plump skin. It took me about a year to come to that convulsions. It seems a little pointless to put the product on just to rub some of it off to get the results you want. Probably will find another product to give me the dewy, youthful look"

This is exceptional at creating an I just worked out or just had a perfect facial glow should you want to rock a no MU look. For a year I've been rotating this moisturizer with Kate Somerville's ExfoliKate Glow Moisturizer depending on what my skin feels like and if I had to choose between the two...so tough, but I ran out of this and am missing it (hence re-order jar #3). ExfoliKate's Glow absorbs quicker and is a little lighter. This is a little heavier/denser of a moisturizer BUT I LOVE IT. A little goes a long, long way hence you can be generous with it and let your neck drink it up, too. Still good to wear under MU, just give yourself a few minutes if you can pre MU application. If you have to rush and can't wait the few minutes (brush your teeth), not a big deal. My IT Cosmetics CC cream layers and wears really well on top of this. Also to note, I just got Tatcha's Water Cream using my rouge points not long ago and it's no comparison to this. Too light for my oily yet dry/thirsty skin. The Dewy Skin Cream hasn't clogged my pores (coming from someone who used to have cystic acne at one point) and it's just pure heaven. Packaging is beautiful. Smell is lovely, too. Enjoy!"

So definitely a plus! I just finished my third jar, and will absolutely with no hesitations be buying my fourth one.   I highly recommend this product, especially to those dealing with dry skin!"

If I’m doing my makeup I only apply a tiny amount because a little goes a long way with this. It’s pricey but worth it because it’s a quality moisturizer. It makes me want to try out all of tatcha’s products in hopes they’re all like this one."

It's very hydrating and has a silky smooth texture that acts as a lovely primer for makeup. A little goes a long way!  Side note: I don't like a matte face, nor a greasy one - just a healthy glow/radiance. If you're super oily or want to mattify, this is probably not for you."

This cream has a nice silky feel, and it goes on so smoothly, but the residue it leaves is just not good. It feels sticky, and even when I used it as a night cream, I still woke up in the morning like that. It’s almost as if it made my skin oilier overnight!  Even though it doesn’t work for me, I still love the look and feel of the cream - just not on me. The packaging is beautiful, and unboxing it feels magical.

Every once in awhile you find that product that just does it for you and this is it for me! Love the light scent too. I could see where combination to oily skin folks wouldn’t like it. Use the water cream if that’s your skin type. I like that one too and use it just on my nose.

For me, the price is absolutely worth it - although it only lasts me around 3 months. For the past couple of months I have been on the hunt trying to find a comparable creamd absolutely nothing changes my skin like this (I have tried drunk elephant, Josie Maran, Charlotte tilbury, philosophy, drugstore brands, etc...)

This cream is excellent for holding that moisturized (dewy) look.  I use the dewy cream underneath the tatcha pore refining SPF.  Sometimes I add a little highlight on top and go foundation less or I can throw on a little primer and add a few drops of foundation on top as well.  I love makeup, but use a dime size amount of foundation.  Not sure how this would work underneath a heavy application of makeup."

More youthfulness, glow, less acne and flare-ups, smaller pores. It looks like I had a hydrafacial for the past 2 weeks straight. When I ran out of the sample I've never been so quick to purchase something in my life. At first I was nervous to use because of the purple/synthetic appearance, but switching to other lotions makes my skin mad. This purple goodness is what my skin craves and needs. I feel so confident for my wedding day skin thanks to this amazing product!!!! I definitely recommend to any bridge looking for a slightly more affordable end of the luxury spectrum face cream. PS - I definitely recommend the essence with it as well."

I didn’t know I had an issue with dimethicone until I used this moisturizer so for those who aren’t sure about the ingredient, definitely do a sample and see how your skin reacts.

It’s a nice, thick cream and it’s one of those moisturizers that immediately makes your skin feel smooth and plump, plus the moisturized feeling LASTS. Even better, you don’t need much of this product because it’s so thick - so the jar lasts! I got the smaller $22 size first and was surprised it lasted a few weeks - the container was so tiny I didn’t think I’d get more then 3-4 uses out of it so that was really nice!

But I wanted something that came in a larger size because I would use up the Caudalie tube too quickly -- using it on face, neck, decolletage and back (all very sensitive, dry, break out prone etc areas for me).  I used this for over a month hoping that my skin would get through the adjustment period and love it.  Unfortunately that just didn't happen for me.  Pros are that it is very rich and moisturizing.  Cons are the risk of breaking out for the acne prone/sensitive skin women out there, and the scent (too perfumy/floral for me).  BTW, I now use YTP moisturizers (Glow @ night and Adaptogen during day -- love!)."

My skin gets dry in the winter, and I introduced retinol, but since using the Tatcha Dewy Skin Cream, I have no dry feeling all day long. Scent, color, texture on application are amazing.   Con: This product does not play nice underneath others. At first, I though the problem was the Tatcha Pearl, which has an interesting texture and takes some work to blend correctly, but it is the Dewy Cream that is a problem. No matter what goes atop this cream, it pills. It is not a good base for foundation or even a sunscreen bb team. Even a spray sunscreen pills over this. I tried applying less, and giving it more time to soak in, but it kind of sits atop my skin too much.  I'm using it now as a night cream and for my neck and decollete. So, while it is still useful, it doesn't help with a dewy skin look if make-up is a part of your day."

I was actually PRAYING I wouldn't like this when I got a sample size to try, because after all it IS pricey. But sadly it IS worth the money... at least the mini size. I say that because I only plan on using this under makeup when I want to look my best. So I can justify spending the $20 on that (even though it's still pricey for how little you get). But I already have been using Tatcha's tinted eye cream for over a year, so I HAD to try this too and I'm glad I did! Also, I've tried their water cream and while it's not good for dry skin most of the year, it works really well under makeup on a super hot day!! So yeah, Tatcha is worth the hype."

It keeps my skin plump and moisturized all day long without causing breakouts. Over the past four months I’ve noticed a significant difference in the visible health of my skin too. Less is more with this product for those of us with oily skin. I do have to dab at my T zone to remove shine throughout the day but that’s personally no big deal for me as I wear minimal makeup. I also tried Tatcha’s Water Cream moisturizer; it’s recommended for oily skin and I found that it does not moisturize as well as this one (I had to double the amount of product) but it greatly reduces shine. All in all I’d say give this product a try!  (FYI: All my other skincare products are dermalogica)"

It helped diminish a lot of my acne scars along with improving my overall complexion. These days I feel so much more confident in my bare skin thanks to a combination of tatcha skin care. I generally do not leave reviews, but as someone who has struggled with skin issues and knowing there are many people out there with the same condition I feel it is my duty to spread the word.

As soon as I applied DE's Umbra Sheer, it started to pill. When I applied makeup (eye shadow, eyebrows and bronzer) it pilled some more. A good alternative to this may be DE's Lala Retro, but this moisturizer can make you look more oily than dewy if you have combination or oily skin."

Which is close to impossible to find for me. I’ve tried SO many products that just never work. My sensitivity either reacts, causes my acne to flair up, or it just doesn’t moisturizer enough.

Meaning I do my usually skin care routine (am /pm)but before I apply makeup I put a small of this cream on and then prime my skin, i find the makeup is more radiant, applied smoother , and skin is softer looking. It doesn’t hydrate as well as the lamer oil but I have dry skin so if your skin is normal you may really like this. (I also tried their water cream one but that’s even lighter of a moisturizer so oily skinned ppl would love it ). Packaging is pretty.

The itchy bumps and uneven, dry texture almost completely disappeared after one use. I literally have to stop myself from touching my face because i cant even BELIEVE how smooth and supple it feels.  The cream is expensive but its SO rich that the tiniest amount goes a loong way so it will definitely last you a good amount of time.  My new holy grail. Please never ever stop making this!!!  (Also totally safe under makeup and creates a beautiful canvas for foundation application especially when I combine it with the hourglass primer!

I have the most hydrated, bouncy, and nicest complexion  I've ever had in my life, even my dermatologist complemented me for such a change, need to emphasize that I use it every day, under makeup, or without makeup, and wash my makeup off  every night (just so you know) and use it mostly during the day, night  time I use something  else (use the scoop to measure the amount you use), but its totally  worth the money."

Then I tried it, and was not thrilled at all. Even though I frequently swap creams, this is the first time I have ever broken out with multiple large blemishes after a single use. Usually it takes a couple weeks before breaking out. I tried it again twice more (weeks apart) thinking maybe it wasn't this cream... both times large blemishes the very next day. It is very pretty in the jar, and even though I normally use Fresh Black Tea Corset Cream (which is very heavy) this felt way too thick and product pilled very badly when I touched my face hours after applying it. It feels like the product just sits on your skin instead of absorbing into it even when using a small amount."

Oddly enough this makes my skin break out less. Needless to say, after my sample ran out I purchased the full size.

I went to bed looking great and woke up feeling even greasier! I wanted this to work so I continued to use it and used less and less every night to the point where I was hardly using any, I still woke up looking like a grease ball every morning. After 5 days of use I started to get huge pimples on my checks and I looked greasy all day by the end of the week.

			"review_text": "I have been a die hard DE face cream for awhile, but thought I would try the tatcha one when DE changed their formula. The packaging is beautiful, the cream looks great and feels good going on. But about one hour after I put it on, I felt my make up start to pill off my face because of this cream. You literally can’t wear make up on top of it because it will come off your face in little balls. It’s so weird. I’ve kept it just to wear at night a few times a week, but it’s incredibly expensive to only be able to use at night a few times a week. I ended up having to order the DE one again for the day time, and by the way the formula feels almost identical. If you’re deciding between the two, or even this one and another one, go with the alternative. Sadly this is just not worth it."

Anyways, thought it’d be amazing, but it did not play nice with my other products, all of which are clean/organic.  After a process of elimination, research, and reapplying my entire skincare regimen multiple times, I believe the pilling issue is due to the Dimethicone in the Dewy Creme, which is high up on the ingredients list and widely considered a not “clean” ingredient. This does not absorb into skin, sits on top to give a smoothing effect.  Will never purchase."

(It would be too heavy for me on hot summer days.) I'd rather it not have fragrance, but in this product, it doesn't seem to bother me. And of course, it comes in an attractive Tatcha jar. I got a deluxe sample, using my Sephora points (thank you, Sephora). I wish that size could be available for purchase, for travel. Am glad I got it with points, and I can scoop some out of the full-size jar (once I get it) with the spatula, into the mini-size. Oh, and this moisturizer feels heavy on my skin for a little while, and then absorbs to feel smooth but not greasy."

I've never had a moisturizer do that before. I gave it 2 stars because the smell wasn't too overpowering, and I DID try it with makeup since it was sticky enough to act as a primer- but my face was oily quicker by the end of the day than with my normal face primers.  I just don't see what the big deal and big price tag is with Tatcha products!"

I’ve been trying every freakin cream possible and this is the only one I found I love I’ve bought it twice now. I won’t go back to anything else... if you have extremely dry skin this is it!!! I will say though it does work well under makeup but if you like to leather yourself in cream this won’t work under makeup. But that shouldn’t matter if you just want a good cream. buy it!

I used sooo many other expensive products; i also tried indigo and water cream of tatcha. But this dewy skin is the best. I immediately see the result of texture improvement, and brighter skin tone. I use it for nighttime, water cream is better to use for morning and under makeup. I completely understand why other people cant have good result while using this cream with makeup because this moisturizer has many rich ingredients that would nurture the skin’s needs. Of course it’s too good to be under the layer of foundation and all those makeup ingredients that have potentials to ruin the skin’s textures even more. Makeup skin can only work well with light hydration such as water cream."
