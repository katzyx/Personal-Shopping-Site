			"review_text": "The pump on C-firma doesn't have a tube to the bottom of the container so it has to be turned upside down. Unfortunately this also didn't fix the issue for my bottle and the pump doesn't work.  As mentioned in other reviews it does have an 'interesting' scent and I found the product feels tacky/sticky on my skin. Unsure if this is normal as my first 'Drunk Elephant' purchase."

It definitely has a weird smell. I’d say it definitely has a weird smell - irony like blood but also Smokey like bbq? It’s weird. I’m glad I bought a small size first so I won’t feel as bad not using it."
