Sheu2019s been having some puberty breakouts for a while now, within a few weeks of using these products her skin is almost completely clear. I was really surprised. We tried all the normal acne treatments and nothing was helping. This stuff is awesome and works quick. Plus she loves the smell of peaches!  Thank you for giving my daughter clear skin!"
