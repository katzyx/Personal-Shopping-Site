This new addition to the Good Girl family reveals the multifaceted nature of modern femininity with a seductive blend of rose, vanilla, and patchouli..About the Fragrance:The newest addition to the Good Girl family, this exotic elixir reveals the multifaceted nature of modern femininity with a seductive blend of ravishing rose, voluminous vanilla, and smoky, scintillating patchouli.",
	"ingredients": "Alcohol Denat., Parfum (Fragrance), Aqua (Water), Benzyl Salicylate, Coumarin, Linalool, Hydroxycitronellal, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Limonene, Citronellol, Geraniol, Benzyl Benzoate, Benzyl Cinnamate, Alcohol, Citral, Tris(Tetramethylhydroxypiperidinol) Citrate, Benzyl Alcohol, Ci 60730 (ext. Violet 2).",
	"how_to_use": "Suggested Usage:.-Fragrance is intensified by the warmth of your own body. Apply in the creases of your knees and elbows for a longer-lasting, stronger scent.&nbsp;.-After applying, avoid rubbing or dabbing skin. This breaks down the fragrance, causing it to wear off more quickly.&nbsp;.-If you prefer placing fragrance on your wrists, be sure to reapply after frequent hand-washing, as this tends to rinse off the scent.&nbsp;.-Replace fragrance after 12 months. Expired perfumes more than a year old lose the integrity of the original scent... Eau de Toilette or Eau de Parfum?: .The difference lies in the volume of perfume oil. While EDT contains five to nine percent, EDP contains more, usually eight to 14 percent. EDPs, therefore, last longer and smell more intense.",

I paired this with the CH Good Girl body creme and it takes it to another level! I don‚Äôt know why people don‚Äôt brag about her body creme as much as her fragrances. It is pure luxe with the texture, consistency and makes your fragrance last longer. I‚Äôve loved the original Blush version since it came out but Babbeee this elixir has me in a chokehold!

Let's just begin by admiring how gorgeous the high heel shaped bottle is, perfect for any fragrance collection. The fragrance itself has amazing projection. I sprayed it at first into the box and placed it on the counter in my bathroom, and the room smelled like the perfume for 2 days. So, if you're sensitive to fragrances, this probably isn't the scent for you, but if you're looking for longevity, it's perfect. It can be a bit strong, but it's a beautiful, feminine floral scent. I'm usually more of a gourmand or fruity floral fan, but this is a lovely, warm floral scent. You can definitely still smell the vanilla as well as the rose and patchouli. It gives off a seductive, sexy vibe, something you would wear on a date yet still feminine and dainty enough to wear during the day. I highly recommend trying this perfume!"

I loved the hints of vanilla and rose. Feel like this would be a very good everyday perfume! Also, love the packaging!  The perfume is a bit strong. Someone who is a bit more sensitive to perfumes, may have a little issue with how strong it is. 1 spray lasted me all day."

I felt minimal hard to press the nozzle because of the shape of the bottle.  Packaging: This aroma is kept in extremely lovely and fragile pastel pink stiletto. The shape of bottle looks exceptionally alluring, unique, charming and gives barbie energies. Generally speaking, the container is wonderful and the scent is magnificent fresh-floral yet areas of strength for not. Highly suggested!"

This radiant reinterpretation of the classic Good Girl fragrance unveils the complex essence of contemporary womanhood, blending sensual Vanilla and exotic Ylang Ylang for a captivating aroma.   This perfume has become an absolute staple in my collection. I reach for it every single day. I get compliments when I wear it, and I feel so confident when I do. This fragrance is sexy, it perfectly embodies womanhood to me. It is floral, you get the notes of ylang ylang almost immediately. It isn‚Äôt spicy per se, however, I would say it does have warmness to it that lean towards spice. Everyone has different body chemistry and has different longevity when it comes to perfumes, for myself I can confidently say that I can smell this perfume on me for 6-8 hours. That said, it could last less than that on someone else. My advice is to spray around your neck, and if you apply vaseline first it will definitely stay a lot longer if that is a concern for you. This perfume is luxurious, so you will spend money on it. But the packaging, smell, and longevity truly make this a worthy investment in my opinion."

It‚Äôs less sweet and more intoxicating. Don‚Äôt be fooled by the sharp opening. She‚Äôs very floral and citrus in the opening, but dries down to a beautiful soft musky vanilla. Usually these type of scents give me a massive headache but this one didn‚Äôt cause that for me. Unfortunately, lasting power was a bit disappointing on me, around 5 hours. I typically spray three times on my neck and wrists. I have yet to try the Vaseline trick but that should help it last longer. The bottle is heavy and feels good in the hand, and the spray is also excellent and projects well. Good girl elixir is definitely a perfect scent for a night out or colder seasons. I personally like it a lot more than blush."

This scent has become my absolute go-to for spring and summer, effortlessly transitioning from daytime outings to elegant evening affairs. What sets it apart is its versatility - regardless of the occasion, it never fails to leave a lasting impression.  There's a depth to this fragrance that sets it apart from typical fruity scents. It's as if the sweetness is balanced by a subtle complexity, hinting at the underlying sophistication.  What truly speaks volumes about this perfume is the number of compliments I receive whenever I wear it. Whether I'm catching up with friends over brunch or attending a formal event, people always inquire about the captivating scent lingering in the air. It's incredibly flattering and reaffirms my love for this fragrance.  Considering the number of compliments and inquiries I've received, repurchasing this perfume is a no-brainer. It has earned a permanent spot in my collection, and I can't imagine my spring and summer without it."

However, I heard great comments about this one so I took the 50 ml Good Girl Blush Elixir to try it. It turned out that I completely love it! It's more floral than I thought though. It's a floral scent that I could wear during the day and it's quite a light scent in my opinion. I was looking for a more heavy/intense scent like a very sexy scent so I'm thinking of buying the good girl supreme or the original. The thing is: it's quite expensive!! The good girl blush elixir is however an excellent perfume and I recommend it to anyone who wants to have a feminine floral perfume to wear during the day!üòΩüíû"

It will be a bottle that I will keep long after it is empty as decor. The perfume smells really nice. It starts as a floral and then turns into a sweet vanilla. It lasts the entire day and is strong so a little goes a long way. I like to describe it this way: one spray people will smell it when they hug you, two sprays and the person sitting next to you will be able to smell it, three sprays is probably too much. This is not one of those perfumes that you spray a bunch of times in the air and then walk through; that would be way too strong. I like to use it by doing one spray on my neck and then quickly tapping my wists on my neck before it dries. This is a sweet, young and elegant scent. The floral notes are what fade after a few hours and then vanilla is the main note you will smell throughout the rest of the day.  You can tell by the complexity of the scent and how long it lasts that this is really good quality. I also love that it is vegan."

The sillage of this perfume from one spray is not strong when someone passes by unless you spray it 2-3 times on yourself.

This elixir is definitely more sensual and intense compared to her most popular Good Girl scent. The sweet notes of Bergamot and Mandarin Orange really shine through when you first spray it, but it quickly develops into a powdery, floral Rose scent. As it settles it starts to reveal a bit of Vanilla undertones, but not in a sweet way. To me, it definitely gives more of a mature, warm, floral scent. It‚Äôs a very wearable perfume for any age group. My daughter who is in her 20‚Äôs has been stealing it, and my mother who is in her 60‚Äôs also quite enjoys it! I‚Äôve been wearing it to work most days, and while I do find it to be a stronger fragrance, the scent does fade a bit throughout the day. I can definitely still smell it at the end of my work day so you can expect it to last at least 7 hours! Also, the iconic Caroline Herrera perfume bottles are gorgeous! The packaging certainly accentuates the luxuriousness of this perfume experience. The high heel stiletto bottle fades into a light, soft pink colour that fits with the name of this perfume perfectly. It is a bit on the pricier side coming in at 130$ Canadian for a 30ml bottle, but it is so worth it! Highly recommend!"

			"review_text": "I received a free bottle of this to review, and I am so happy I did! The bottle is absolutely adorable and the perfume smells amazing. It is a creamy floral scent that is a little bit sweet, but not overly so. While I immediately pick up on the vanilla, it is more of a creamy vanilla scent. As I am usually not into sweet scents, I am pleasantly surprised that the sweetness isn‚Äôt overwhelming and it just adds a rich creaminess to the otherwise mainly floral composition of the fragrance. While it is described as having orange mandarin notes in it, too, my nose is not quite able to pick that out - I‚Äôm just getting a floral and creamy fragrance that has some depth to it.  Since this is a flanker of Good Girl Blush, I‚Äôm gonna draw some comparisons for those of you that are curious about how the Elixir differs. When looking at the notes, the main difference is that the peony has been swapped with rose, and tonka bean with patchouli. Personally, I have a hard time picking out the specific notes, though, and actually feel like the original blush might have more of a rosey smell than Elixir to my nose. I feel like the Elixir version is creamier, so maybe the vanilla is amped up a little but it also smells ‚Äúdeeper‚Äù, in a sense, and I think that may come from the patchouli. I feel like the original Blush is fresher in almost a ‚Äúsoapy‚Äù way to me, and maybe a bit powdery, too. That being said, once they dry down on the skin it gets harder to pick out the differences.  While Blush is an excellent summer and day-time scent, I feel like the Elixir is like a darker, night-time version of Blush - good for a night out or for cold weather months. I would say that Blush Elixir is slightly more complex and has more depth, while Blush is more simple and fresh. The longevity of the Blush Elixir is also amazing on me. I get 10+ hours of wear on skin alone, and even longer on clothes. The perfume also atomizes out of the bottle in a beautiful mist, so overall I am very impressed!"

I think its great to layer this with a scent that is sweet or fresh as well  think this may be a hit or a miss for those who don't like floral smells, but it's great to try out. the fragrantica site says the primary note is vanilla then floral but I disagree. it's more of a fresh light floral, but u can try to layer it with a more expensive sweet based perfume.  The biggest con is the price for the amount you get though. The normal full size is 50 mL and while the bottle is cute the spraying function is a little awkward"

It has a very subtle floral fragrance which lasts very long. Imagine walking in a park which has a field of peonies. I also applied it in morning and I could smell it until early evening, so that's quite long lasting. Last thing, it would also add as a beautiful decor on your dresser."

She would hate me and she‚Äôs already 13 so we are not going to walk that line. It‚Äôs super feminine and sensual and does not smell overly of roses. It‚Äôs a very warm floral vanilla scent that I find also has some pretty good staying power. I‚Äôve been experimenting with Nest and 7 Virtues perfumes which also smell lovely but don‚Äôt quite last as long. The bottle is also precious, but of course treat the GLASS STILLETO with caution as the component is very fragile."

When comparing other fragrance bottles, it‚Äôs sometimes hard for me to tell what brand they are, as some fragrances come in a simple bottle, nothing unique that stands out.  Good Girl Blush Elixir stands out from other fragrances, the shape of the bottle is unique, it looks stunning on a vanity and it definitely is eye catching.  I like that there is no cap to this bottle, simply press down from the top and you will get a generous dose of the fragrance.   I checked up on the notes of this fragrance and the top notes are bergamot & mandarin orange. Middle notes are ylang ylang & rose and base notes are vanilla & patchouli.   When I smelled this fragrance for the first time, I noticed that it was very floral yet citrusy at the same time which made for a good combination.   As it dries down, it becomes powdery and I was able to get a whiff of that rose scent. Did not pick up on any vanilla. There was another scent that I picked up on but couldn‚Äôt pinpoint what it was. Almost like a earthy scent which I believe it to be the patchouli note but I can‚Äôt too be sure as I‚Äôm not really that familiar with the scent of patchouli.  As for the projection of this fragrance, it lasts long. I sprayed this early morning and was still able to smell the fragrance even several hours later.  This is a perfect fragrance to wear during the evening, but can be worn during the day as well since it‚Äôs light.   It‚Äôs a really nice blend of floral & citrus which I find would be perfect to wear in any time of the day."

The Blush Elixir is a 2 tone bottle. The scent for me I think is a little heavier than its early version (fully pink bottle). I would wear it more the evening and wear the other during the day.

The packaging, like the original, is a beautiful and unique design. The scent itself is very reminiscent of the original Good Girl, however, I pick up more of a floral scent with the Blush perfume. Overall, if you liked the original, I think this product is worth picking up. However, I do prefer the original to the Blush scent."

The good girl eau de parfum supreme has been one of my favourite fragrances as of late, so I knew when I was receiving this one chances are I‚Äôd like it. It‚Äôs a nice mature sent that settles down sweet with that fresh undertone of Patchouli. I‚Äôll be reaching for this often I‚Äôm sure, and the bottle is absolutely stunning."
