L‚ÄôOccitane Ultra rich body cream is made of 25% shea butter. The high concentration of shea butter in inside this body cream made it ideal to use for dry and sensitive skin. This body cream comes in handy to replenish a dry skin in winter season.

			"review_text": "I used to work in healthcare and the skin of my hands felt at times like it was falling apart until someone gave me a tube of L'Occitane's Shea Butter Hand Cmrea.  It became something I carried in the pockets of my scrubs at all times.  So you can imagine I was thrilled at the idea of testing their body cream, which turned to be just as fragrant, creamy, and nourishing, on top of the familiar silver and blue packaging. I appreciate the recyclable tin and can't help but wonder why there is a plastic refill available, when the tin is made of metal, which can be recycled forever.  I've only used the cream for a handful (ha) of days because the terms of the collaboration indicate I have to post a review within 7 days.  I don't see any change in the texture of my skin but I do feel a big difference; it doesn't feel nearly as tight as it did before I started using this cream.  I do a lot of spot checks throughout the day -- thankfully a little bit of cream goes a long way!  And I love the smell -- I can smell the jasmine and it's, for me, heavenly, as I love the smell of jasmine.  I'm not sure if both the hand cream and the body cream are always needed; this cream seems to be doing wonders on my hands.  So if you're thinking of trying both the body and hand cream, consider starting with the body cream and see how your hands like it, before buying the hand cream."

However, it seems like you get skimped a bit on the amount of product received.

Now that that's out of the way, I was not expecting what I got with this body cream. I know this is an expensive brand so I guess I was expecting something really high end and bougie but everything about this cream is down to earth and effective. The packaging is a simple tin with a screw on lid. Inside the tin is a plastic liner that holds the cream. I haven't checked, but it looks like it might be refillable. The cream is very thick and stiff. It feels almost like cream cheese in texture and consistency, it's that thick. But after I take some out and warm it up in my hands it gets smoother and more emollient. It spreads across the body really nice and absorbs completely with no residue left of my skin. It's so weird for something that thick to totally absorb into my skin like that, but it does. It helps so much with moisture and hydration! My skin loves this stuff! It has a very light scent nothing obnoxious or over bearing, like other high end brands. It's made of 25% shea butter, which is probably why it works so well. It's a pretty big container as well, it has 6.9 oz by weight. Which will last me a few months at least. I will say this is probably best as a winter body cream because of how thick and moisturizing it is but if you have super dry skin you could probably use it all year long. My skin is more dry on my body especially in the winter so a product like this has been perfect for me.  I haven't looked at how much this costs partly because I do like it so much I don't want the price tag to ruin that lol but even if it does have a higher price I still recommend this, it makes my skin feel like velvet"

I happen to like it and it gives me a nostalgic camping memory of a particular bug spray they don't make anymore. this is some RICH cream. I imagine u can use powder over it so you don't have a tacky feel if your wearing tight clothing before it's fully absorbed. it will most definitely do the job of moisturizing tho. I mostly suffer from dry hands, so an all body cream isn't usually what I go with but it does leave my skin looking beautiful and feeling smooth after shaving and showering. in my experience when it comes to moisturizer for hands and body, quality is better over quantity so its worth the price tag. will def be purchasing the hand cream version in the future. thanks influenster!"

I both like and dislike the packaging on this product. I think the packaging looks amazing, but it does attract LOTS of moisturized fingerprints! There‚Äôs also a weird cutout inside of the tub that I feel is unnecessary, and could have been utilized for more product. It kind of feels like you‚Äôre getting fooled into believing that there is more in the container than there actually is.   As for the actual product itself, it did what it was supposed to do! It is an excellent moisturizer with a thicker consistency. It‚Äôs not as thick as their hand cream, thankfully! That stuff tugs at your skin, while this goes on gently. There‚Äôs no dyes or added perfume, so you don‚Äôt have to worry about sensitivity!   Now, we talk price. This is an average body cream at best. It is NOT worth the $50.00 price tag for 6.9 oz! I‚Äôd say it is comparable to NIVEA Creme, which is $11 for 13.5 oz.   Save your money and go with the NIVEA."

It feels like butter on the skin. It rubs in nicely and it doesn‚Äôt leave my skin feeling greasy. A little bit goes a long way and it is absorbed quickly into the skin. I have been using it daily for the past couple of weeks. I use it right after the shower to trap the moisture and make the cream more effective. I usually only apply it to my arms and legs because that it where I feel the dry skin the most. My skin is very dry because of the winter season. Using the cream doesn‚Äôt irritate my sensitive skin at all. I noticed a difference in the texture of skin immediately. It is not too thick or heavy so it would be good to use year round. I do really like that it is refillable. The only thing is that it leaves a decent portion of the tin empty. The refillable insert is very easy to take out and replace. The only thing that I dislike is the smell. It is supposed to have a jasmine and ylang-ylang scent but it smells like chemicals to me. I would 100% consider purchasing this in the future. I recommend it to anyone who wants a quality and nourishing body cream."

Upon receiving the product I noticed it came in a super cute tin with an easy to remove plastic dish with cream inside. Super cute! The cream has a slight smell to it but is not overpowering and fades away quickly. The cream itself isn‚Äôt oily and goes on very smoothly. A little bit goes a long way with this one. Since using this product I have noticed a big difference in the softness of my skin! Definitely recommend!!"

			"review_text": "I have actually been a big fan and have used the L‚ÄôOccitane Body Cream in the past. So I thought I was getting the same product to review. However, after opening it and instantly noticing changes, I realized they revamped this product. They made this product now Vegan and suitable for kids 3yrs old and up as well. The product is now is able to be taken out and you can buy a refill, instead of buying the entire product again. The refill is not much cheaper so I don‚Äôt see many taking advantage of it. All those things don‚Äôt bother me. But the main issue I have is they changed the iconic fragrance to this Jasmine smell. It instantly bothered me and interacted with my perfume. It also lingers for quite awhile. Body Cream has to smell good or you won‚Äôt want to use it, and unfortunately this new smell ruined the whole product off for me. It does make your skin soft and feel hydrated, but I noticed it also had a heavier feeling than the original product. I wouldn‚Äôt recommend this product, especially if you don‚Äôt like floral smells."

The lotion has a light fragrance but it disappears once applied to skin. This soft buttery lotion rubs and absorbs right into the skin. Use this daily after showing and it is sure to rehydrate your dry skin and leave you with the silkiest soft skin."
