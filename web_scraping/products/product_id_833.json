I am a huge fan of blush and this color is so pretty, it‚Äôs a pretty pink color with a burgundy undertone that adds a little more color! The packaging is super, coming in a heart form and also a stamp. The product is super easy to pick up with the stamp and then applied on my cheeks. The heart stamp is more for just placing and doesn‚Äôt really help with blending so I reccomend either blending it with a sponge or your fingers! Product left behind a very beautiful pink glowy color and a little went a long way. I have a medium skin tone and was really satisfied with the color. Will 100% continue to use this !

It's not sticky, but it stays wet enough to blend into your cheek or wherever you stamp it. But not too wet. Wet isn't the right word but I can't find another one to explain it. The color is beautiful. It's like a peony color and it's so pigmented on the cheek. Even when blended it it stays pigmented. So if you don't like heavy blush, be careful how much you use. I'm actually impressed with this. I wanted it for the novelty of it, but I actually ended up truly liking it a lot. 10/10 would recommend."

The packaging and design of the overall product is so so cute and innovative. The stamp makes a perfect heart shape but I find it difficult to pick up enough product using the stamp and the cushion blush and it gets a bit tiring and taxing to unlock the stamp on the top and manually stamp it to get the product. I find that once you get enough product, one stamp for each cheek is perfect for me. The blush is definitely pigmented but still manageable for blending compared to some other liquid or cushion blushes I‚Äôve tried. It is also very buildable. The blush color usually stays on most of the day for me and doesn‚Äôt wear off. All in all, I love this blush and it has become a staple in my collection, especially for summer!"

You can use a little, or a lot of this blush because it builds equally well.  I have used this amazing blush with and without first using base/foundation. I love the way the case opens up and holds the heat sponge to keep it safe and clean.   The compact is small, and easy to take with me.

This innovative blush offers a unique twist to the conventional blush application, making it a fun and convenient addition to my daily routine.  One of the standout features of the Cheeky Stamp Blendable Blush is its adorable stamp design. The small stamp on the cushioned applicator makes it easy to achieve a perfectly defined and precise application. It provides a level of control that I‚Äôve never experienced with traditional blush brushes or sponges. The stamp‚Äôs size is just right, allowing me to effortlessly deposit the ideal amount of product onto my cheeks without any mess or fuss.  The blendability of this blush is exceptional. Once applied, it effortlessly melts into my skin, leaving a natural and radiant flush that enhances my complexion beautifully. The formula is buildable, allowing me to create both subtle daytime looks and more dramatic evening makeup effortlessly. I appreciate that the blendable blush is available in a range of shades to suit various skin tones, ensuring everyone can find their perfect match."

The stamp clicking is so satisfying I spent a good 20 minutes stamping it before I actually used it with the blush haha  As for the blush itself, it‚Äôs the first time I‚Äôve used a cushion blush. I personally find that I need a bit more than one stamp per cheek with this color. The blush dries down to a natural finish. While it is a bit sheer, it can easily be built up into a nice glow on the face. It does fade away by the end of the day but it‚Äôs more long lasting than I expected from a cushion blush.   Overall, I‚Äôd recommend this if you like natural looks and if you‚Äôre a sucker for cute packaging haha"

Somehow the super cute heart stamp pulls me in and makes me want to use it. The stamp part looks and feels like a smooth, bouncy makeup sponge. The formula of the blush is light in consistency and provides a great middle ground between too pigmented (read: easy to be heavy handed) and too light. One small tap gives a nice natural glow, which looks awesome over my tinted moisturizer or (gasp) bare face after using skincare. This can be used on barely-there makeup days and built up for a full face. Just make sure you're not using a powder before applying this on the cheeks! We don't want any pilling!"

It's a waste of product to stamp it on using the heart stamp. I tried it the very first time and wasted a lot of product and since then have decided to just press with my fingers and blend onto my cheeks! There are many other cream blushes on the market that have the same colors and do the same job that will give you more product!  However, packaging is on point and it's great to display!"

The only issues I have are that if you try to use this as a heart stamp, product does gather heavily around the edges and the price point is kind of insane for a pink blush. I really like stamping a heart and then filling the center with some pink highlighter. I‚Äôd recommend buying it if you want to splurge on some cutesy packaging and you love cream blushes."

I tried it with a beauty blender by dipping it directly onto the fusion, but that soaked up way too much product at a time, it deposited a good amount, but the fusion started to dry up in about 7 uses with a beauty blender. It also fell on the floor out of my makeup bag and the top part broke off at the hinge! The plastic is very clunky. Plus you get such little product for the price, I feel like I need a new one every 1-2 weeks if I use it every day!!! I would give it 10 stars if it was the same gel formula, but with more product in a tube, like a liquid cheek paint. That would make it perfect! Please make it happen!!!"

If you put it over foundation or without it, i it just doesn‚Äôt seem to last for some reason. Other than that, it smells good, looks good on the skin, and is easy to blend. It‚Äôs not too sheer but looks naturally pretty radiant. I love this product and I recommend it to anyone who wants to achieve a no makeup- makeup look! If you‚Äôre going for full glam, maybe this isn‚Äôt for you (or any cream blushes for that matter) but if this is for an everyday, glowey, glossier esk look, have at it! My favorite shades are 06 and 03. They both compliment my medium skin w/ neutral undertone skin tone. Great price too, most cream blushes are expensive. One thing I mike that I thought I‚Äôd hate is the application! The spongy applicator is so easy to use and really good for pictures. Other than the lasting issue, I will definitely incorporate this into my bag!"

Drink a glass of water beforehand to be hydrated. Apply your primer, foundation and concealer as usual. DON'T POWDER YOUR FACE YET!!!  Now you're ready to apply your blush. DON'T USE THE STAMP! I know it's cute and you want to, but don't. It's a trap. The blush will dry too fast and you will be stuck with weird spots on your face. You don't want that.   Use your finger and gently press the cushion. Now, gently tap your fingers where you want to apply the blush. DON'T RUB IT! You'll ruin your base. You can layer it as much as you want. It really blends well with fingers. I didn't have much success with brushes/sponges.  Now that you've finished your blush application, you're free to continue your makeup as you wish. You can put powder on top of it, but is has a really beautiful finish when left by itself. It lasts a very decent amount of time too."

Good thing because Influenster sent me this for free to review. Anyway, I don‚Äôt know what is wrong with me but I find it super hard to blend and it makes my cheeks super pink. I want a light pink flush not a full cheek worth of flush. It is just too much. Now I will say, this is not a shade I would buy for myself, but I think my problems are not with the shade. I don‚Äôt find it possible to regulate the amount of product you‚Äôre putting on you‚Äôre face when you‚Äôre stamping a sponge into the product. I feel like I am just constantly applying too much product and there is nothing I can do."

I guess it's fine if I'm just using it for a night out, but I wouldn't be able to apply it in the morning and expect it to still be there by the end of the day. However I'm open to trying a different shade to see if that helps. Sad because the 01 Coy shade is actually pretty natural enough to wear to work.  For reference I'm a light-medium shade, but it seems the darker your skin is, the more difficult it is to get this product to show up. Also, while I didn't have any issues blending this, some people do. If you're not a big fan of liquid blush or previously had a bad experience, this is probably not going to change your mind. However if you've never tried liquid blush before or just open to this particular brand/product, I think it's worth a try (you might be one of the ones that actually like it).

Weaknesses: The top compartment gets a bit dirty where it holds the sponge, and the staying power could be better. I feel it lasts about a half day on me before fading, and I do set it with a loose translucent powder over my whole face. Overall I recommend this product, it is certainly the best cream blush that I have tried, with the best pigmentation and blendability. It would have 5 stars from me if it lasted all day on me."

I am not sure if it‚Äôs the fact that it‚Äôs a liquid product or because of the formula, but whenever I wear it, there‚Äôs a flattering sheen that it gives off! The reason why I took off 2 stars is that I don‚Äôt think the packaging is very practical because 1. It‚Äôs bulky for it not having that much product 2. I am very into skincare and the applicator doesn‚Äôt seem very sanitary to me so I don‚Äôt use it and rather use my fingers or a beauty blender. I recommend the blush itself as a product, but I am not a fan of the packaging!   I would also like to add that I received this product complementary from influenster for my fair and honest review!"

If you don‚Äôt want to use the sponge you can use your finger or brush then blend out. I would recommend this if you are not looking for powder blush."

I understand Kaja is a Korean brand and Korean brands do not use powder that much but I would have just preferred a different formula but that's my personal preference.

Blends very well and does not dry the skin  Having said that, I am not a fan of creamy blushes even though I have super dry skin. I am not sure if it is the way I apply the product, but creamy makeup starts wearing out on my skin and doesn't stick. It has been the same when someone professional has used them on me.  So while this may be a great product for someone who loves creamy blushes, it is not for me.  I will not pay the asking price for this."

I have olive skin and the dusty rose provides a very natural color but if I were to get this again I‚Äôd go for one of the other ‚Äúbrighter‚Äù shades for a greater pop.

The stamp amount is a little much for me, like I said I‚Äôm still getting used to it, so I just take a dense real techniques brush stamp it in lightly and put it on the apples of my cheeks as well as up towards my temples and on the tip/bottom of my nose.

I blend the product out with my morphe sponge and have absolutely no problem blending it out perfectly. Have even tried blending it out with fingers and still blends out very nice. Some people say it‚Äôs more difficult to blend out wet product onto an already powder-set face but I had no problems. Just make sure to not let it sit for long. Any product will dry out after some time, making it harder to blend out. The concept of the stamp is so cute. The packaging is a little bulky but that‚Äôs okay because the product is amazing and makes me want to buy more shades. A little bit of product goes a long way. Color does fade a little bit after a couple hours, but usually this is the case for most blushes. I have received this product complimentary for testing purposes for my honest review."

Let me say it again for the folks in the back this blush will knock your socks off. Not only is the applicator the cutest thing in the entire makeup world right now. The colors are so beautiful and natural that they compliment so many different skin tones. I've read some of the other reviews and people said they had trouble blending but I honestly didnt. I used a brush and it blended in flawlessly. So I reccomend using a brush instead of a beauty blender. I recieved this product for complimentary testing purposes but have already bought the coral shade myself I loved it so much."

I'm a medium skin tone, so this may be why. I'd image this product may fair better with a fair skin tone, but if you have a warmer tone, like me, this may not work for you. The other issue is that the stamp either picks up too much or too little product. Half the time you waste the product, because it hardens over night on the stamp and isn't usable. The shape of it is nice for the cheeks, but all in all it just didn't work as expected and is quite wasteful for the price."

This blush is exactly what I was looking for to get that summer glow! The blush itself has a creamy texture that is easy to blend with my fingertips or a brush. Another highlight of this creamy blush is that it didn‚Äôt cracked when I accidentally droped it. In other words, is mess-free!

However... this applicator felt cheap and goofy. LOVE the concept, but the sponge was quite stiff, making for a cheek stamp rather than a blendable application. When using your fingers or beauty blender though, this works flawlessly. Having received this as a free sample for review, I was concerned about the color not working with my light olive skin tone, but the color is beautiful. Would work with many shades!"

I‚Äôve never had luck with liquidy blush and assumed this would be the same. Luckily I was wrong. This was so so easy to blend (I recommend using a beauty sponge) and worked perfectly for me. I would also suggest doing light stamps on the cheeks and not focus it all in the middle because that definitely eases the blending process. I would highly suggest this to anyone iso a new blush.

I really love the color, mauves work pretty well on me, and it‚Äôs light but buildable. However, I‚Äôm pretty fair, so I don‚Äôt know how it would show up on other skin tones.   The only thing I‚Äôm not the biggest fan of is the stamp thing. It‚Äôs too hard to really pick up even product to get the cute heart shape (which isn‚Äôt a big deal, tbh‚Äîsince you never NEED a heart shape on your face), but no instructions as to how you are supposed to clean the thing are included. Am I even allowed to get it wet? No idea. I like to keep all my makeup stuff clean, so this bothers me. I could use another brush, but then that makes the whole heart stamp contraption on the top a colossal waste of plastic. Gorgeous product, not sold on the packaging."

I noticed that getting ana even stamp on both sides was a little difficult because matching the product and pressure on each cheek was a little tricky. None the less the product applied seamlessly, but a little goes a long way. Not sure how long the ink would last or how fast it will dry up is definitely a concern.

With just one press I got a natural beautiful flush and with just one more I could get a more dramatic night time look. The liquid is impressive in this cute little dispenser. At first I thought it may be a bust given it looks like something in my young daughters fake makeup but WOW was I wrong. The consistency makes for perfect available color that's not drying or flaky at all. It dries quickly but feels soothing and almost moisturizing when applied. I absolutely love the way it felt on my skin. I was equally impressed that it lasted all day with no touch ups needed. Overall great product and the application method adds a little fun to your morning routine."

I wasn't quite sure how I would feel about it being more of a liquid/cream blush but I honestly prefer it over powder. It gives me such a beautiful and natural finish. I also love how quick and easy it is to apply, all I need it a tap of this and I just use my fingers to blend! I also loooove the color of this blush, like I sound like I'm exaggerating but it is honestly such a beautiful color on my skin tone. I have deep dark skin and was worried that it wouldn't show up/ would appear ashy but nope just a beautiful pinky color. The one slight downfall is that it is shimmery and I prefer blush without shimmer in it but due to this I just use a light hand when applying highlighter so it balances out. All in all, so in love with this product and so happy that I received it complimentary for testing purposes. I would definitely recommend this to a friend! my sister is already asking if she can borrow it lol"

It‚Äôs the cutest packaging ever the heart stamp is really cute and makes it fun to do your blush. At first when I applied this I was worried it was to dark because it is a very dark blush but it blend out so light and gorgeous which is saying a lot because I don‚Äôt use very many blushes it is a liquid so be warned you do need to put this on before you powder your face or it will take your foundation off but when applied correctly it‚Äôs very nice and lightweight. In the picture I attached to this review to the left of the stamp I did blend out some using my finger where you can see the blended out version as you can see it‚Äôs very subtle and light so don‚Äôt let the darkness of the stamp scare you away from this product because it does blend out beautifully."

Patty in the blush gives it more pigment, while smoothing it into your skin makes it more sheer and more natural. It goes on very smoothly and I never wear blush, but I like this one. Just not a fan of the heart stamp."

This specific color I think was to dark for me because I am very pale. I love the packing of this product though!"

The shade was a little dark for me so I had to really blend it out and stamp it a little lighter. But this goes so well with Kaja‚Äôs mochi glow. Stamp once for a natural-looking flush, or twice to build to a bold color. I think twice is a lot unless you‚Äôre going for a very very bold look or doing a costume look!"

When you first apply, the texture is more creamy and wet. After you blend into the skin, it turns to a more dry and powdery finish. It blends really well with the sponge included. I personally like to blend it with beauty blender, which gives you a more natural look The liquid formula works especially well with cushion foundation, which I love I also love the color! It is a peachy nude works so so well with everyday makeup Overall it is a really nice cushion blush with very cute packaging.

The stamp for the cushion gives it character which makes it super cute and super fun to play with.   I received this blush in the color Coy. After trying it on for the first time today, I love how the color is very natural and light. It blends very well and you can build up if the color isn't pigmented enough to your liking. A little bit of this product goes a long way. I've worn the color all day now and the color has yet to fade. I just absolutely love everything from the stamping concept, the cushion to the color. I will definitely be buying more of this once I'm out and trying the other colors to see which to add to my vanity."

Although I probably will use my beauty blender from time to time, this is great for people that don‚Äôt have a sponge because it‚Äôs an all in one. The prices are right and well worth what you get. I love the shade I tried, 02 Saucy, & I‚Äôve already purchased shades 01 & 03 because I love them that much. Kaja PLEASE release more shades, these are amazing and a stand out product in my book for sure!"

It also picks up just enough blush to where I don‚Äôt look fake, but the blush is a good natural amount :) I only use the sponge it comes with for application. I use a regular blush brush for blending. I received the product for free or complimentary for testing purposes."

I actually received this product complimentary from influenster, and I am so glad I did because I am not sure I would have thought to purchase a blush like this on my own! The idea of the product is to unscrew the cap, and use the adorable heart shaped sponge to press x amount of product (from a cushion with the blush soaked into it) on to your cheeks. I thought this product would melt right off my oily skin, but I was wrong. The shade I received was 02 (saucy) and is the most gorgeous, glow from within pink shade ever. It wears well all day, is super easy to apply (I use a stippling brush to apply, only because I can‚Äôt make myself ruin/use the cute heart sponge it comes with, lol). I have not used many blushes other than powder, so I‚Äôm not sure how it would compare to other brands, but I know that I am now a fan of this type of blush and application and would repurchase in a heartbeat! The only reason I give this 4 stars is because I noticed it definitely pulls off some of my face product when I use a powder foundation. I haven‚Äôt noticed it as much with liquid foundations, but because I love the way it looks and the formulation, that is fine by me!"

I‚Äôm a very picky person when it comes to blush. I usually like a very natural mauve-like color. This is generally very hard for me to find. Most blushes that I find are either way too pink or way too noticeable. Originally seeing this product I thought it would be the same - too pinky - but I was instantly wrong! First of all, the application sponge is in the shape of a heart, so right off the bat it is unique and fun! Simply stamp the heart shaped sponge in the blush product and stamp on the apples of your cheeks and voila! Then simply blend with fingertips or if you choose, use a blush brush. Either way it is super easy to blend out and is such a perfect amount of blush! I highly recommend this product to anyone. You can use a little or use a lot, either way it will look stunning!"

The color is nice, and I just take a beauty blender and dip it into the cushion, but the color payout on the cheek is very low and I prefer something more pigmented.

I usually think that blushes are either too red and unnatural or too dull to make any noticeable difference. This one is the perfect shade, it has no sparkles which looks more natural. After using it a few times, i heart the application process. There is no brush required which is great for those hurried mornings or when you‚Äôre traveling. It also stays on for a long time and doesn‚Äôt come off as easily as a powder blush. You can layer to but as much of as little as you would like. I also weirdly like the smell of it!

The stamp is just that, a stamp that you press into the pad in the bottom of the case and then just press to your cheeks and smudge with a finger or a brush. The result is a pretty pink tint. There is a slight sparkle in the 'ink' which may not be for everyone. Also I can see the compartment with the applicator getting ink all over the inside if you don't clean the brush after each use (hack: drop a tiny bit of a tissue in the bottom to avoid this!).   It's cute compact and seems to wear very well. It's a nice strong pigment so perfect for stage lights. I'd give it a try!  I received this product in return for an honest review."

Now with that said, this was my favorite product I received in my VoxBox! My makeup style is more natural and that is why I tend not reach for a variety of products. Since receiving this Kaja blush stamp, I‚Äôve reached for it daily. It is a cream/liquid blush which could be why I‚Äôm a fan. I‚Äôve been a huge fan of liquid bronzer and highlighter lately because to me the texture provides a more dewy, natural look vs. ‚Äúcakey.‚Äù Anyway, the application is fun and easy. It‚Äôs a heart shaped stamp that you dip in the product and stamp onto your cheek bones. It says to use one stamp for a more natural look and two stamps worth of product for a heavier look. I used one stamp then blend with my fingers. It blends so easily and I‚Äôm left with the perfect wintery rosy cheeks. Something I usually stay away from because I have rosacea but I currently have it under control and can just enjoy the pretty rosiness! It‚Äôs been lasting through my entire 12 hour shifts so I can vouch for its staying power. I‚Äôm typically more of a bronzer person to add some color to my pale skin but I honestly think this product may have converted me to cream blush .. for the winter season, atleast :)   I received this product in color 02 Saucy which provided a natural look for my fair colored skin. I‚Äôll include a photo for reference! Though I received this product for free, the above thoughts are my own based on my personal experience using this product."

The hearts are a cute touch and the product goes on well. (No cakiness) I would strongly recommend this and plan to use it as part of my everyday look. Natural with a hint of color is what I like to go for. Just be mindful that it is a ‚Äústamp‚Äù and blends better with your fingers/sponge oppose to a makeup brush"

I did retry with just a touch and it was easier to blend but WAY to pink for my skin tone. It is like OVERWHELMING.

No more being afraid of Blush!  Pros: The formula is perfect! I love that this product is universal for all skin tones! I‚Äôve been playing around with them! I appreciate how it dries down nicely and doesn‚Äôt ‚Äòmake any patches! I tried it as Blush, a quick lip tint, and a little tint for the eyes!  Cons: I wish the heart applicator was made of plastic rather than a traditional foam. Plastic would be best since it can be cleaned easily and be more sanitary friendly.  I highly recommend this Blush! This is definitely great for simple to full glam looks"

I personally like the stamp I think it's cute and fun and so easy to blend out with a sponge, a brush,or your fingers. It's easy to control, and can be built up very well for a more dramatic Rosey cheek! I received this product FREE to test out. I honestly love this and definitely be purchasing other shades."

Here's my two cents on this blush: the pigment is GORGEOUS and the consistency is creamy and very easy to blend. The color is a mauvy rose tint, which is the shade of blush I typically tend to gravitate towards. The stamp itself is a cute heart shape and works well for applying product, but I wouldn't recommend using it to blend out the blush. Overall, a fun product to use and a lovely color. Will be using this one daily."

I have yet to try it on bare skin but I give it 4 stars because I didn't feel like it sat on foundation well. It dried nicely into a powder but the moisture from the beginning messed up my foundation underneath. I don't typically go without foundation of some sort on so I'm not sure this product would be for me. But if you do, I can see where it would be nice and light with just enough natural color. #IHeartKaja #contest #complimentary @kajabeauty @Influenster"

I‚Äôm a very picky person when it comes to blush. I usually like a very natural mauve-like color. This is generally very hard for me to find. Most blushes that I find are either way too pink or way too noticeable. Originally seeing this product I thought it would be the same - too pinky - but I was instantly wrong! First of all, the application sponge is in the shape of a heart, so right off the bat it is unique and fun! Simply stamp the heart shaped sponge in the blush product and stamp on the apples of your cheeks and voila! Then simply blend with fingertips or if you choose, use a blush brush. Either way it is super easy to blend out and is such a perfect amount of blush! I highly recommend this product to anyone. You can use a little or use a lot, either way it will look stunning!"

It also stays blendable if you let the stamp sit on your face for a few minutes before you blend it out. The shade I tried had a bit of shimmer in it once blended and I really enjoyed the shimmer. The color was awesome as well. Seems like I might have to start using blush again. Once my whole face was done the color on my cheeks made me look really fresh and a bit younger. Also I received this product free/complimentary for testing purposes‚Äîbut I would totally buy this once I run out."

I was a little hesitant about trying it since it's a cream blush and I had never used a cream blush before. But the application is so smooth and it blends out beautifully (I just use my fingers) with a powder like feeling. The packaging and application process is beyond adorable. The only real down side I can think of about it is that it's kind of bulky. That is if you had a small bag and wanted to bring it with you to go.

If you stamp it on your cheeks once it looks very subtle (perfect for those no-makeup makeup days) but since I wanted a full glam look I did it twice and blended with a beauty blender. I had already applied setting powder and it still went on perfectly fine on top of that! It has great staying power too, compared to so many of my other blushes that fade off in a couple of hours. Really impressed and would definitely recommend to everyone!"

My biggest concern, though, is that there‚Äôs no extra sealant on the inside to protect the product. Usually with cushion foundations they have an extra cover on the inside to prevent the product from drying out, and this has none. I didn‚Äôt keep this product long enough to confirm whether or not it did dry out, but this is very poor storage to me.
