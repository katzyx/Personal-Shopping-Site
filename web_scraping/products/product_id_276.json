	"how_to_use": "Suggested Usage:.-Fragrance is intensified by the warmth of your own body. Apply in the creases of your knees and elbows for a longer-lasting, stronger scent.&nbsp;.-After applying, avoid rubbing or dabbing skin. This breaks down the fragrance, causing it to wear off more quickly.&nbsp;.-If you prefer placing fragrance on your wrists, be sure to reapply after frequent hand-washing, as this tends to rinse off the scent.&nbsp;.-Replace fragrance after 12 months. Expired perfumes more than a year old lose the integrity of the original scent... Eau de Toilette or Eau de Parfum?: .The difference lies in the volume of perfume oil. While EDT contains five to nine percent, EDP contains more, usually eight to 14 percent. EDPs, therefore, last longer and smell more intense.",

			"review_text": "This is the most beautiful sweet musk! I am having the hardest time placing the scent notes because it is very much a sweet skin scent, nothing more to it to me. It’s inoffensive, vague enough that it’s not sharp in any which way, and pleasant all around. Its top notes are bergamot, orange blossom, and honeysuckle which contribute to the vague sweetness with pretty unique scents. Middle notes are warm skin accord, vanilla orchid, and sun kissed peony. The top notes evaporate fairly quickly and come off upon first spray so the middle notes and the base / dry down (salted praline, fresh musks, white cedar wood) makeup the primary scent profile to me. This Skin scent is not sharp, but it is still “there”- there is a distinct scent about it that is very sweet for a traditional skin scent. For me, this is a positive as I enjoy sweet scents but just to put that out there for skin scent lovers! I love the dry down on this fragrance and the travel size is square and heavy, it feels luxe just like the original bottle would."
