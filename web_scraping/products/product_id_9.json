It still provides moisture and definition but without the heaviness, and I find it works really well for air drying. I can even use it as a one-and-done on days I don't want to put much effort in, which is always appreciated!  I'm one of those who loves the minty and herbal smell, I find it very refreshing. However, I do appreciate that the smell is polarizing, so it's probably a good idea to smell a tester in-store first to see if you like it. No matter how good a hair product is, if I can't stand the smell, I won't use it.   Since there's so much product and a little goes a long way, I think the bottle will last me a really long time. I do like to switch up my hair products on wash days depending on my hair's mood, the weather, and the styles I'm going for, but I will definitely keep this in my hair product rotation, it's a good one!"

I pray they never stop selling this or change the formula as this whole line is a staple in my routine. I was able to braid my hair after washing it while wet!! I've not been able to do that since I relaxed my hair every 6 months years ago. This w/ the deep conditioner completely detangled my hair and my hair even had a sheen to it again.

I like how light the products are and how soft it makes my hair (without the stickiness). I also love how the gel provides really strong bouncy hold for several days with about a teaspoon of product. I usually need to use a lot more gel to get the hold I want (I would typically use about 2tablespoons of breogio curl charisma). I would definitely purchase this product again. I would‚Äôve given it a 5 if it had a little more slip and milder smell. I will say that the first time I used these products, I used too much because I‚Äôm used to using more with others products. It felt sticky, heavy, and the smell was a little too potent for me. Once I reduced the amount of product though during my next few styles, I really liked it and the smell was a lot lighter, fresher, and pleasant to me. I would advise experimenting with the amount you use if you had a similar experience before throwing it out."

It does soften and detangles my hair well.   I first started using this with other shampoos and conditions, but styled with this and the curl cream.  I use for twists and wash-n-goes with much success.  Sometimes I use the oil and sometimes I don't.  What I have learned recently is that this product does cause me itching.  It took me a while to narrow the problem down to this product. I will continue to use it until I finish off the bottle, I have about .25 left.  However, I will not be repurchasing.  I am learning with my scalp that less is more and to avoid leave ins, given that the itchy scalp tends to happen with leave ins.  I have extremely sensitive skin, so having a product cause itching is not that unheard of for me.  I have yet to have found a leave in that does not cause my scalp to itch.  My recommendation is to try this product.  If you don't have the itchy scalp problem, then you most likely will enjoy it.  I think it has the right about of thickness and is not too greasy for us low porosity folks.    In terms of the smell, it really doesn't bother me and I am pretty sensitive to smells.  The smell is minty, but does disappear after a while.  The smell can seem overwhelming the first time you use the product, so give it several weeks before returning based on smell.  If I have one complaint, it's the size of the bottles.  I would love it if there were a small and large bottle of this.  A small bottle would make life easier while traveling and give customers a chance to try the product for a few months."

I am white with half gray, fairly thick, coarse, somewhat wavy hair.  I have never found a product that worked well, I have been using coconut oil, which was recommended by a black friend.  I so appreciate the reviews from the white customers, just because I was encouraged to try this product.  Score!  I live in Mexico and am in the sun every day and the ocean often.  This product is amazing.  It untangles, adds softness and shine without making my hair heavy or greasy.  I use it as directed but also in my own way.  I use a small squirt in the morning on dry hair and it is wonderful.  ALSO, I use two full squirts before I go into the ocean, then braid my hair.  The sun is intense enough to create a heavy conditioning effect, and this product seems to be protecting my hair from the saltwater.  My hair feels (and looks) so much healthier after just a few uses!  Equally important to me are the facts that this is a black owned brand and it is a clean product.  I am going to recommend this product to everyone who mentions my hair; I just got a compliment today.  Thank you, Adwoa, for this awesome product, and thank you, Sephora, for identifying black owned brands."

It was a true ‚Äústyler‚Äù and leave-in. My coils would clump together with that one.  This new formula is thinner, like water, which should make it better for penetrating low porosity hair, but it lacks moisture and needs half the bottle to saturate wet hair. I am not sure what the goal was with this new formula, but it leaves my hair sounding crispy like hay, no moisture, no softness, no definition. Perhaps there is too much glycerin or oil, but the ingredients don‚Äôt seem compatible with hydration and softness. I just wasted a wash day on this entire product line and need to re-do my hair. It‚Äôs that bad. I will be returning this mess."

I live in an region with very humid summers and I also swim, and DevaCurl always left me still a little dry and in need of regular olapelx treatments. I‚Äôve tried some curl products for POC but they almost always ended up being too heavy for my hair (I am white). I decided to take a chance on this new brand after reading the reviews and honestly cannot believe how good the results have been! My curls look so healthy and way more defined. With Deva Curl, I‚Äôd always have to re-wet my hair and more often than not just fully rinse and just restyle/add products, which really adds up. But using this line I‚Äôve been able to sleep on my hair and not have to do anything the next day, which is amazing.   When I do wash, I‚Äôm using a clarifying shampoo (because of the swimming) and currently I‚Äôm using what I have left of DevaCurl decadence. I‚Äôve been pairing the Adwoa leave in with the Adwoa curl creme then finishing with the DevaCurl gel I have. But once my Deva products have run out, I am making the full switch! I always needed so much Deva product that when I traveled it was always easier to just get a blow out rather than fill a small suitcase full of product. But now I won‚Äôt have to worry about that and can actually just enjoy my curls anywhere :)"

This line has given me similar If not better results than anti breakage, bond repair products.  I used the shampoo, mask, leave in styling lotion and curl lotion.  At first use like I said, I noticed less hair in the drain and on my brush and comb.  I was able to use a comb in one pass without any knots or breakage.  My hair felt strong, smooth, moisturized, shiny and full.  I blow dried to stretch the hair and did a twist out.  my mom asked me if it was my real hair or if I had used crochet.  That‚Äôs how good it was!  I also got complemented by another person.  I was able to lay my hair without using any gel or edge control.  It looked natural and not greasy at all. It has a menty smell which is not overwhelming or overpowering at all.  It also disappears after a while.  It is pricey but you get so much product.  The only minor issue was that I had to use a lot of the shampoo to get it to foam and lather, but remember you only put it on your scalp not the hair shaft itself.  Overall the best line for natural hair I have ever used and I have been a natural for 7+ years so I have tried a lot of products.  I can‚Äôt wait to see the long term effect.  I highly recommend."

Also thick which makes it hard for product to get in without heat.   After using this product for about 3 weeks I have had compliments on my curls. I think the prouduct alone works but I do the following: I use verb shampoo every other week for my ithcy oilly scalp( thats when I know I have build up). Followed by a deep conditioner. ( currently using camilla rose pink jar smells like mint). Then this styler and my favorite begoir oil. Other days when I wash regular I use brigeor quinoa  cowash every other day and this leavin every other 3 day as a refresher ( water then the product) and my bigeor oil or rose oil which ever I see first.  Note: I don't recommend using on dry hair it doesn't look good. wet hair works best. Good luck. I wanna try the deep conditioner when it comes back in stock ( picture shows it wet. )"

			"review_text": "I RIDE OR DIE FOR THIS LEAVE-IN!! Listen - I first went natural in 2017 and had enough heat damaged that I was rocking ponytails and buns for a while. Then I took the leap and did a mini-chop/DevaCut before heading back to college.  THIS PRODUCT SAVED MY HAIR!! I had no idea what I was doing with my curls (4A-B, low porosity) and was prone to waiting till the last minute for wash-day. This product made my life so much easier and it smells AMAZING! You do need to follow the directions for this product since the ingredients work best with a good amount of water! But I bought the whole line then and will continue to use the leave-in until they don't sell it anymore (which I hope they never do). It's my holy grail leave-in - Every once in a while I'll go back to TGIN using TGIN or something else but this one always holds me down. TOTALLY WORTH IT!"

This is like the natural, clean and kinky version of head and shoulder cause it does everything and then some. My hair loves LOVES this leave-in and sometimes this is all I use the just put it in a puff and go. Def makes my wash days soooo simple and short."

It‚Äôs absorbs within each strand and provides slip so that my fingers and detangling brush glides gently and unopposed. I have 4b/c hair and this leave in along with the rest of adwoa beauty products are stables on my hair routine! I discovered this product line in fall 2019 and have not strayed away since! I love these products and look forward to maintaining healthy hair while using these products!"

			"review_text": "Pros: This leave in conditioner is excellent. It's thick. It's creamy. Combined with the adwoa twisting cream and the adwoa oil, my hair looks shiny and moisturized for far longer than any other natural hair line I've tried. It's worth the money.    My twist outs stay defined for longer, too. Perhaps the only downside to this is that I get less volume (I like volume) in the first few days. However, longer definition leads to styles that last longer, which means that I am spending fewer hours on my hair. Time saved>volume in this case.   Con: The smell isn't powerful, but because winter green has never been a favorite smell, I don't like the scent. But, the smell fades fast. Plus, you get used to it after using the products week after week because the smell is not strong. In this case, the product's results outweigh the scent."
