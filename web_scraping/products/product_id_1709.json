The thing that made me have the scent fall out of favour for me is someone saying they personally didn't like it because they found it very patchouli heavy. After that, I was able to pick the patchouli out of the notes very easily and it kind of ruined it for me. Truly is a lovely evening scent, it feels sophisticated.  Though personally, the years of wearing it started to make it feel reminiscent of an old lady scent as well though. Partially because I could see myself having a bottle of it on hand for as long as they produce it, hoping that will be until I am an old lady haha."

            "review_text": "I realize that perfume is highly personal.  I do not like this one, I'll be returning it.  I was hoping, based on the description that this might be a bit more floral and earthy due to the mentioned added notes of patchouli and warmer floral notes.  The perfume is sickly sweet to the point of being irritating.  I left it for an hour to see if it would settle and had to wash it off.  I  couldn't stand it. Most perfumes in the west have a smell that is the same between all of them and I believe it's in how they are manufactured.  They all have an overpowering kind of alcohol smell that never goes away.  I was hoping to smell all the floral notes mentioned but I really just smell too much sugar and that production carrier smell. I've purchased perfumes from the middle East before that do not have this production smell at all so I believe it's the way they are produced.  it's possible that I might just prefer sented oils and perfume in general is not the right choice for me."

I am blown away by this scent, it is so unique and vibrant without being too overpowering. The florals are so light and airy, almost as if walking in a garden with the faint smell of flowers. What really makes this perfume so special though is the base notes of vanilla and patchouli which really complement the florals to give it a lasting and comforting smell that lasts throughout the day. I can't stop smelling my wrists, I am so obsessed with it and I'll definitely be buying a bigger bottle when my travel size runs out. I'd say that this is your scent if you like a mix of florals and warm notes like musk and vanilla, because the two together is just breathtaking."

Usually a perfume will last on my clothes even if it wears off of my skin but not this one. My Chanel perfumes (which are cheaper for the same volume!) last until days later on my clothes. Unfortunately I will have to stop buying this perfume, especially for the price you pay (which has gone up in the past year!!).

This is great! I got it with my rewards points in a trial size; it comes in a dabber bottle, and I feel like I would prefer it as a spray. It's still wonderful, though.  When I inhale this, I get a weird warm, fuzzy, gentle comforted feeling, for some reason. I'm not sure exactly why, because I don't think it actually is familiar -- it just feels that way. It makes me feel warm and happy and relaxed. It's just a nice, gentle sweet, feminine fragrance that I love.  I have to give it 4 stars because I don't think I would place it in my top 3 and I reserve 5 star reviews only for the absolute best of the best, but this is definitely a solid 4.5; one of my favorites, and I will likely buy the full size once it's within my budget (i.e., a couple of months after the holidays lol).   In terms of longevity, I would rate this as average -- it lasts a few hours on me; it's neither super long lasting nor does it fade quickly. No complaints about it, but no praise for it either. I would love to try the body lotion with it to see if that helped it to last even longer."

Its a soft floral scent that really incorporates the best out of floral notes but it isn't aggressive.

(Not on my moisturized skin points or clothing) could not smell any lingering notes. Usually new perfumes are very strong for me and I need time to get use to its strength. Tried it several different times and still no lasting smell. I may have received a defective one (maybe frozen during shipment to the retail store? IDK) Havent had a chance to try the tester again at the store. For now this is not so 5 star-ish rating as others here in the reviews...  that seems to go on for miles. ps. still have most of the bottle left....maybe I can exchange it?....maybe not?"

My husband said to go ahead and order a small bottle to ensure it smelled just as good in a bottle vs paper, then weu2019d get a bigger bottle if so. I sprayed it on myself and wow! Yummy!

Contrary to popular belief it is not that both of us count Harry Styles, Eric Andre, and Pete Davidson among our list of lovers.   We do, however, both smell like freesia, rose petals, and vanilla, because we both wear Flowerbomb!  The gift set itself was indicative of how I feel while wearing the scentu2014dainty, feminine, and luxurious. It was a bit on the lighter side, so I did find myself reapplying during the day, but I love the overall floral scent and how it changes as it sits on the skin.

Usually I hate patchouli notes, but Flowerbomb is one of the few fragrances that makes it bearable to me (the patchouli and musk notes are the only reason I took one star out).

First blast is vanilla and baby powder. The dry down is sweet musk with the tinest hint of rose and the slightest wiff of Patchouli... Which is just insulting to a Patchouli lover. This is not a bad fragrance. It does smell nice. But its flat and one dimensional. Absolutely nothing like the elegant fragrance protrayed in the description. For that reason I believe its way over priced and over hyped."

Iu2019ll never forget. So fast forward - he breaks up with me over FaceTime. I meet him a following weekend to bring our things back to each other. One of those things was his comfy (one of those big blanket sweatshirt things). I was reluctant to give it up. So I sprayed my guys Viktor & Rolf all over the inside. Fast forward 3+ months. Weu2019re on good terms. He lets me know that after all that time and 2 washes (he should prob wash it more) that my scent still lingers. Now thatu2019s QUALITY. May he never forget."

Iu2019m not sure exactly how to describe it but I do agree with the other review stating that itu2019s more of a gourmand floral scent. I just recently bought bbw whipped rose latte body cream & I think they mix well together if that helps any lol. This perfume has a similar whipped gourmand scent & then when it dries down you can smell the patchouli notes which are definitely always my favorite."

It is a pretty floral that dries down to a soft powder which I do like although some seem to call that a grandma smell. I would not say that but I would say that it is not unique in any way. I believe that it has rose in the heart which I personally tend not to like and this could be part of the reason why I am not loving this parfum.  It would probably be a nice spring/summer scent as it is not overwhelming. I would not purchase a full bottle for myself but I might gift it to someone else."

I most detect vanilla, patch, musk, orange flower & EXTREMELY subtle hints of jasmine, osmanthus & freesia. Not very floral on my skin. Itu2019s a sugar bomb with a whisper of spice from the patch. Sillage is arms length that quickly settles to a skin scent. Longevity is right at 5 hours on me with well moisturized skin. It smells very similar to so many frags on the market so itu2019s not full bottle worthy & I would not repurchase. Itu2019s a safe blind buy. Basic, simple, subtle, inoffensive, crowd pleasing."

I felt like there wasn't enough bergamot for the top note and that the jasmine just didn't come through in the middle note. Maybe it's because of the vanilla base note that was pretty overpowering, but it didn't smell as floral as the name suggests - at least, definitely not a flower bomb. The vanilla overshaded the floral scents made the floral middle notes smell almost synthetic. However, I was impressed about how long the vanilla lasted (I just am not a personal fan of the vanilla). Also the patchouli base note helped in making it smell feminine with the sweet and spicy, but also evened it out with just a hint of muskiness. For longevity I would rate it 6.5/10."

Flowerbomb is a soft feminine luxurious sexy fragrance.. this fragrance lasts beautifully through the day/evening leaving a soft sweet/mature floral luxurious finish. If your looking for a sexy but sweet classy fragrance FLOWERBOMB is what you need right now. The bottle packaging is absolutely gorgeous and is going to look so pretty on my vanity.
