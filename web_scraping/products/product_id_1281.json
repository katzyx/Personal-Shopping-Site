The Intensive Conditioner is an amazing product when it comes to moisturizing and nourishing curly and coily hair. As someone with naturally curly/wavy hair, I've struggled to find a conditioner that truly hydrates and revitalizes my hair. Pattern Beauty's Intensive Conditioner does just that. It's enriched with high-quality ingredients that penetrate deep into the hair, leaving it soft, manageable, and noticeably healthier.  What I love most about this conditioner is its incredible ability to detangle even the most stubborn knots. I can confidently say goodbye to those frustrating moments of dealing with tangled hair.  The product's fragrance is also a pleasant surprise. It has a light, natural scent that doesn't overpower, making it suitable for people with sensitivity to strong fragrances. Plus, it's free from harmful chemicals and sulfates, which is a huge win for those who prioritize clean beauty products.  In conclusion, Pattern Beauty's Intensive Conditioner is a must-have for anyone with textured hair. It's an absolute lifesaver when it comes to maintaining healthy, beautiful curls and coils. With its exceptional performance, clean ingredients, and thoughtful formulation, this product easily earns a solid 5-star rating. I can't recommend it enough!"

If this didn‚Äôt work well, try the Lightweight. I‚Äôm glad that I did!  Now there‚Äôs a Medium Conditioner. I‚Äôll have to check it out although I‚Äôm very content with the Lightweight.

			"review_text": "I am a fair-skinned redhead with fine, very curly hair (corkscrew curls, pencil to Sharpie diameter). I bought the Pattern 3-conditioner sampler, so I could see what works best for me. My hair has been dry lately, due to hypothyroidism, and I wash it more in the summer. So I need good hydration!  Anyway... If you have fine hair, do not be afraid to try the Intensive conditioner!! Even though this is an intensive conditioner -- kind of like a hair mask -- it is not too heavy for my fine hair. I find that it hydrates beautifully, and after being rinsed out and then paired with a curl-defining leave-in cream, my curls are very defined, shiny, bouncy (not at all weighed-down), and frizz-resistant... even in hot, humid, rainy Maryland summer weather. I'm very happy with this, and can't wait to try the Heavy and Medium conditioners. My hair has different needs depending on the time of year, weather, and my activities. So it will be interesting to experiment with all three. I also look forward to trying the leave-in curl cream.   Another important note: I am very sensitive to perfumey, over-fragranced products. That's not a problem with this conditioner. It smells nice (NOT overpowering) when using it, and then the fragrance fades. So it won't clash with your cologne or make you sneeze!   I'm loving this line of products so far! Please keep carrying Pattern products!"
