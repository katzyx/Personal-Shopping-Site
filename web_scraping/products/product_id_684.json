Also the light shade leans too yellow. They need to work on expanding their shade range in both directions"

I've always preferred tinted moisturizers with light to medium coverage since I hate *feeling* makeup on my face. For a long time, I alternated between Bare Minerals Complexion Rescue (light coverage, kind of goopy feeling) and Glossier Skin Tint (basically no coverage, but easy to wear). They made me feel put together, but were not perfect.  I'm so glad I took a chance on this tint foundation. It lives up to the name! Light enough that it feels like a tint, but gives me medium coverage like a foundation. Somehow, it gives me that airbrushed look that normally feels impossible to get from a tube. And I just rub it in with my fingers–you can use a brush or a sponge, but I love being able to apply makeup like a grade schooler.  I have dry skin, but it's just so easy to apply and get a beautiful finish from this product without having to layer on a ton of skincare. 1000/10, highly recommend."

I really wanted to love this; the formula seemed a little heavy but the color match was probably 90% of my cool tone skin which is combination but very sensitive. Unfortunately two different days (dry weather, high temps around 55) I came home from work looking like a grease ball had exploded all over my face. I had to use 4 oil absorbing sheets to get the bulk of the oil off my face. This has never happened to me before, and when I left the house I looked normal. I have tried different things underneath (no primer because I don't want another product, I want minimal hence tinted moisturizer) and extra moisturizers at night to compensate with zero improvement. Unfortunately I think this is a miss for me; if you're okay being a little more high maintenance and keeping the oil at bay all day long it might work for you."

It's moisturizing but my face just feels tacky the entire day which drives me crazy. It's also pretty sheer, more so than the Nu skin tint. Not worth the money in my opinion."

The finish is definitely glowy, almost like that skin care glowy vibe. I do feel that it's better to go in with some & build up because of the glow & cause that seems to blend in better. (I used a brush & then used a blender where I felt I needed.) I don't think it's super heavy but I wouldn't say it's light, unless you're going in with a small amount. The perfect primers for me were Pore Diffusing Primer by Rare Beauty on the nose & Milk Hydro Grip all over the rest of the face. A big tip is making sure your skin is exfoliated. I have learned that's when skin tints apply better. Lastly, I wore this about 6+hrs at home & it was fine because I did light set it. However, I feel like being out & about in Vegas heat, idk how well it'd hold up without any setting powder.  Overall, for me this has probably been my fav skin tint I've tried."

All in all, the product evens out my complexion beautifully and gives my skin a healthy-looking glow. If I had one critique, it would be that I wish it were more hydrating as a stand-alone complexion product than it actually is. However, take that with a grain of salt as I have extremely dry skin that requires an intensive moisturizing regimen to maintain.

I wore it for 12 hours and it helped up decently well. It wore off a lot on the areas where I touch my face. It definitely does feel hydrating and had a very dewy finishing but powdered down nicely. I touched up with powder 6 hours in and I looked good as new but by the end of the day my lower half of the face was gone.

As someone with dry skin, I was particularly impressed with how well this product boosted my skin’s moisture levels by 52%, leaving me with a dewy, healthy-looking glow all day long. The formula feels incredibly lightweight and melts instantly into the skin, providing comfortable all-day wear without feeling heavy or greasy. The coverage is sheer but effective, diffusing imperfections and evening out my skin tone while giving my complexion a visibly plumper and smoother appearance. I also love that it’s formulated with 94% naturally-derived ingredients, including hyaluronic acid, which deeply hydrates and enhances my skin’s radiance. The inclusion of plant-based squalane, meadowfoam seed oil, and a rambutan blend provides continuous nourishment, making my skin look and feel smoother throughout the day. A major plus for me is that the product is free from alcohol, GMOs, parabens, phthalates, talc, triclosan, and mineral oil, aligning with my preference for clean beauty products. How to Find Your Shade: I used the Shade Finder Quiz on the product’s website to find my perfect match, and it was spot on! The quiz is simple to use and doesn’t require any purchase or email sign-up to receive your shade result. If you’re unsure about your shade, you can reach out to customer service for a personalized recommendation. This made the process of selecting my shade easy and stress-free. Overall, I’m thrilled with the Veil Hydrating Skin Tint and highly recommend it to anyone looking for a sheer, hydrating coverage with a natural, glowing finish!"

I bought shade 8 first and also 7 for my light/med skin, 8 especially in summer.  It leaves a natural finish without showing in my pores around my nose like regular makeup does now.

			"review_text": "Texture - It transitions from a wet-cream, to a balm that sets into a beautiful finish. With that being said I do recommend trying it with your hands(warmth) and finishing with a dense brush or dry sponge if you like, etc.   Pros:  - Multipurpose: I love wearing it alone for running errands, at the office, or when I want a nice satiny-sheen to my skin.  -  A LITTLE GOES A LONG WAY especially once it's warmed up. I think people use too much of it.  - With proper prep, this is one of the ONLY liquid base products that I can wear WITHOUT setting.  - Pairs very well with Hourglass' concealer, which also has a self-setting effect on my skin.  - Its blurring on my skin and has medium coverage that I don't find to be too buildable but I suppose it's possible. I prefer a light to medium coverage anyways.  - Minimal creasing, if any.  Cons/Learning Curves: - After learning how to use it best on my combo skin, I found that even though I'm oily, I needed to properly hydrate and moisturize with water based products to make it last longer and not emphasize texture.  - It's also not the best shade match, but hourglass doesn't have a decent track record when it comes to that. I wish there was a 14.5 shade or more shades altogether. - I cannot wear this with powders, only setting sprays(love charlotte tilbury w/ this tint) creams, and other liquids. When set or used with powders, it looks very cakey and creases horribly and I'm not sure why.   Cheat code: Although its a water-based product, when I combine it with a smidge of Danessa Myrick's blurring balm, ohh baby its like velcro and sets beautifully plus provides more coverage for all day shennanigans (work to 3rd place to bar and through sweat and tears). I also use Danessa's balm blushes which secretly mattify all the places that tend go oil slick on me without changing the skin like effect or finish of the tint itself. Think Tennile Murphy complexion but with all day lasting power! I hope they never change this formula!"

Two associates really pressed me to just try this in the store, and I am SO glad they did. I finally gave in to all the hype and man, the hype on this is real. I loved the Danes myricks yummy skin, but I have combination skin and that stuff was just way way way too dewy for me, even with powder, it also oxidized horribly. This hourglass skin tint laid on my skin perfectly, was an incredible shade match. People love to say “my skin but better”, and this skin tint is GENUINELY my skin but better. This covered my redness but left my freckles. It is just a nice even veil of coverage. Perfect name for this. Slightly buildable but a light coverage which is perfect for everyday wear. Can’t even feel it on the skin. Didn’t settle into anything, INCLUDING my under eyes and my 11s. I am honestly just so blown away 10/10 would recommend. I set it with the Haus labs bio setting powder but I plan on trying the hourglass one which is also talc free."

Regardless of the colour itself I found that I couldn’t blend it into my skin. Even writing 10 min after skincare it would be streaky. I used my hands. I used my makeup sponge. I used a foundation brush. Nothing ever looked good. I always would notice that it doesn’t pair well with other products. It would also make me really greasy and shiny and hated it. I took a break from it and came to it last week for a couple days. My skin started breaking out and burning. I have not changed anything else.

Very minimal transfer - I apply the lightest amount of loose powder in areas I worry about and it's not an issue. It gives the perfect amount of coverage to hide uneven color, but still lets your natural skin show underneath. It doesn't stay wet feeling on your skin, but stays looking luminous.

I definitely loved the shade match for this product and it was a true neutral undertone. I have normal to combo skin and I will say that although this sat nicely on my skin for a normal 8 hour work day, I had to set it really well with a setting spray and powder. It is too dewy for my liking and the consistency is a bit too wet, so if you put too much it starts to look cakey. It takes a while to also sink into the skin but I definitely think that's what keeps your skin moisturized throughout the day. Again, if you're combo this might not work for you but if you have dry skin it could work a lot better."
