Since it is only a body spray, it isn't super long lasting but I love the scent so much that I could reapply it all day! If you like the smell of the OUAI scrub, this has the same scent!"

The added shine it gives is a delightful bonus, making my hair look vibrant and healthy. I can easily apply it throughout the day, and it helps to tame any flyaways, giving my hair a polished finish.  Moreover, this hair mist is versatile. I can use it on damp hair before styling or as a refreshing touch-up on dry hair.

Overall, this hair mist has become an essential part of my hair care arsenal, and I can’t imagine my routine without it."

My fiancé described it as pina colada. I did find when I first sprayed it on my neck like a typical perfume it did not last very long. When I sprayed it on my hair it did last a long time and gave a nice burst of scent when I moved my hair. I do like that kind of a scent so it’s something I enjoy. As far as the bottle goes it is similar to other body mists but it has a fancy element with the holographic text and simple style. I do feel like I could put it next to my expensive perfumes and it could fit in. As far as the offer of the larger sized bottle I do like the value aspect of it but I do wonder if one could actually use up the product before it goes bad? I know perfumes tend to change over time so it could be better to have a smaller bottle that you can actually use up. That just depends on how often and how much of the mist you use."

When I got the chance to try the Hair and Body Mist from the St. Barts collection, I was instantly transported to a tropical paradise with just one spritz. The scent is vibrant and uplifting—a true mood booster that evokes the feeling of a luxurious vacation.  While coconut isn’t officially listed among the notes, I can’t help but detect a warm, subtle hint of it, which adds to the tropical vibe. What makes it stand out for me is the addition of fresh citrusy notes that balance the scent perfectly. It’s not cloyingly sweet; instead, it dances beautifully between different layers of freshness and warmth.  This mist makes you feel effortlessly sexy and confident. I’m not a fan of overly sweet, overpowering scents, and this strikes just the right balance. It’s perfect for those days when you don’t feel like wearing a heavy perfume. However, as much as I love the initial burst of fragrance, it doesn’t have much staying power. The scent fades quickly and doesn’t linger long on the skin.  Overall, this is a great pick for a light, refreshing boost of fragrance, especially for casual, carefree days. It’s a little escape in a bottle, even if just for a short while."

Let me tell you, this mist is everything I imagined and more. One spritz, and I was transported to a sun-drenched beach, with warm breezes and tropical vibes all around me. The scent is a perfect blend of fruity, floral, and musky. The top notes of orange oil and dragon fruit add a vibrant, juicy sweetness, while the orange blossom and tuberose in the heart give it a soft, elegant floral twist. The base of Baltic amber and musk ties everything together with a warm, sensual finish that lingers beautifully on the skin. What sets this mist apart for me is how versatile it is. I love spritzing it in my hair for that subtle “did-someone-just-walk-by-smelling-like-vacation?” effect, and it layers perfectly on my skin without being overpowering. It’s light enough for daily wear, but noticeable enough to turn heads—and yes, even my husband noticed it the second he walked in the door! He actually stopped and said, “Wow, what’s that? It smells amazing.” If you’re someone who craves a luxurious yet effortless scent that makes you feel like you’re living your best life on an island, this mist is for you. Plus, the fact that it’s designed for both hair and body makes it a perfect travel (or gym bag) companion. My only advice? Get the bigger size while you can. This scent is addictive, and you’ll want to douse yourself in it daily. Trust me, St. Barts isn’t just a place—it’s a vibe, and this mist captures it perfectly."

As an admirer of the body care fragrance, I am pleased to report that it has the same delightful scent as the body cream and scrub. While there are countless tropical beach fragrances available, this particular one stands out as exceptional. The packaging is elegant, featuring a sleek white and clear design that resembles glass, although it is made of plastic. It appears to be of high quality. Upon my initial use, I sprayed it on my wrist and found myself unable to stop inhaling the fragrance. It is one of the rare scents I have encountered that remains present throughout the day. I received numerous compliments while wearing it. The aroma evokes the essence of a tropical getaway without being overly creamy or overwhelming. The initial spray reveals warm tropical notes accompanied by white tuberose, while the dry down offers hints of piña colada. It truly captures the essence of a tropical breeze infused with floral and oceanic elements. I highly recommend it."

One spray and you’ll be transported to a beachy paradise. Speaking of spray, this thing mists like a dream. One of those super fine mists that comes out slow.. ugh, luxurious.  As a body mist, the scent really only lasts 30 minutes to an hour tops but layer it over the St. Barts body cream and you’ll get more longevity out of it. Love it, can’t get enough!"

The scent reminds me of a tropical island and a refreshing drink on a hot day—sweet yet summery, never overwhelming. It pleasantly envelops you and lingers on the skin for about an hour, and on clothes for several days.  I secretly hoped they would release a perfume with this scent. The body mist turned out to be even better than the perfume, as it’s impossible to overdo it—it leaves the faintest trail, disappearing and reappearing subtly. Sometimes I forget I’ve applied it and wonder where the delightful smell is coming from. This mist is a great, non-intrusive choice for summer if you love sweet scents but find perfumes too overpowering in the heat."
