However, dark circles and puffiness can be caused by a number of factors. If you are genetically pre-dispositioned to dark circles caused by pigmentation underneath the eye or puffiness under the eye caused by fat deposits, unfortunately caffeine serum is unlikely to help.",

The clinical proof behind the product is reassuring, and I've noticed a visible difference in just a few weeks. The added bonus of being cruelty-free and carbon net-zero makes it an even more appealing choice. If you're looking for a quick and effective solution to tired eyes, I highly recommend giving this eye cream a try."

You can use any cream to hydrate the eye but using caffeine is genuinely genius. It works amazing for anyone who appears tired, has a dry undereye area prone to creases, and it is even quicker if you chill it in your mini fridge. It just lifts and tightens right up. You still need color correction and it doesn't fix sunken in or deep set eyes but it's a handy quick fix that prepares your skin for the day with or without makeup. You absolutely cannot beat the price either. Literally the best affordable option I've found that has this amount of efficiency."

Overall, if your problem is dark circles, this won't help you, but it might help puffiness a little. At least it's so affordable I don't feel bad about giving it a chance!"

For the money, no complaints.  This is a great budget friendly product.  It is especially great for people under 40 who have less lines to manage.  As I am at the 40 mark, I need a bit more help than this product gives me.  I still use it at night, but go with the GLAMGLOW in the morning as it is more hydrating and really gets to work on the lines.
