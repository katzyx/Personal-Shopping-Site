I was afraid the smell would annoy me, but it's a very light subtle scent. The product did flake off and crumble when I advanced it further out of the tube which made a bit of a mess, but this is really not indicative of the texture of the product when actually using it on skin. Just a bit annoying."

Really revolutionary formula that glides on and blends but leaves you with some pigment. As someone on the lighter end of “light-medium” I was torn between Chocolate Souffle (medium) and Chocolate Mousse (light). Went with Mousse and I was not disappointed, although I think Soufflé would have worked as a bronzer. It’s not too cool but it sculpts more than it warms your skin."

It's more cool-toned than most bronzers, which I love since I find bronzer to be too warm most of the time, but still does a great job of warming up the face. The texture is super creamy and blendable and it feels like it just melts onto my skin. I do find if I blend too much it can kind of disappear, but it's also very buildable so that's not a big issue. Would absolutely recommend as an in-between bronzer and contour color if that's what you're looking for!"

Then I go in with more, and I struggle to blend it to a point where it doesn't look dirty. Can't wait to try once the humidity dies down. I might upgrade to 5 stars then."

			"review_text": "First of all, if you are sensitive or do not like fragrance in your products, avoid this bronzer stick at all cost. I was only opening the box that held the stick and could potently smell the sweet chocolate scent and I don’t have a problem with fragrance so I loved it! When you open the stick and also even as you apply it to your face and or  get a bronzing brush and dab it from the stick itself - you can definitely get that whiff of chocolate smell.  The product was easy to use and it’s really smooth and was an easy application directly on my face BUT a little goes a long way. I try to make slight lines or like one dot (similar to rare beauty) and slowly add more if needed because it can be very pigmented like a blush. The only downside is that because it applies smoothly, the bronzer itself is not sturdy. I know the stick is called melting bronzer & sculpting stick but it is very flimsy and melty when you roll it up and when I would use my brush to get the product through that method and apply it on my face. Like it breaks and so i try to do it lightly everytime so that the whole bronzer doesn’t come crashing down. Overall, I really like it but while it’s a melty chocolate goodness, it could use some sturdiness so that it doesn’t easily crumble (see pictures). I don’t and didn’t even press hard either when I first used and opened it so I’m not even sure how. I know it’s in the name that it’s a soufle and mousse + melting which is probaby why it’s soft but it could use a little firmness."

Its formula is incredible, with squalane and vitamin E in its composition, which is incredible for our skin, the smell is delicious, I was tempted to take a few bites but I restrained myself lol It's a considerably cheap product in relation to the amount of product and how much it yields, I think that if you analyze these factors, it is a product at a very good price. It is also not tested on animals."

Packaging is beautiful, chocolate color component with a magnetic closure. Texture really is smooth and buttery, agreeing with its name - Melting Bronzer & Sculpting Stick. It blends out effortlessly! But if you blend too much, the color kind of disappears. But it’s easily buildable. The color I received (Chocolate Mousse) is definitely more of a contour shade vs bronzing shade and mimics my natural shadows (light/ medium neutral skin tone). However, it’s a little TOO cool toned for my liking, too gray. Which is just a personal preference! I’m in more of a bronzy era than a super contoured look. I do love using it on the sides of my nose to create a snatched look. I’d be interested in checking out the other shades. Overall, I’d recommend this if you’re into cream products (looks like we all are lately!) and want an easy/ non stressful step in your makeup routine."

The chocolate caramel shade gives the perfect amount of warmth to my base. It’s very natural looking. While the product applies easily and is a nice shade, the scent threw me off. It smells like a tootsie roll. I’m a sensitive skin, acne prone girlie. So, I’m very particular about what I put on my skin. Because this bronzing & sculpting stick smells like artificial candy I don’t know if I’ll keep this product in my daily makeup routine. However, having tested it a couple of wears, I didn’t notice any immediate breakouts or skin concerns. This stick wears/blends really well and plays nicely with my other makeup products. But the scent is keeping me at 3 stars for this bronzing & contouring stick. It’s great if you’re not concerned with sensitive skin issues."

The shade I received, Chocolate Mousse, had a nice, slight glow to it and wasn’t too orange or too warm-toned for me, especially as I am quite pale.  The formula was smooth and soft so it blended easily and evenly.  I found that this bronzer brought back a natural color to my face and made it look very naturally pretty.  This formula seems able to sheer/blend out but I’m sure you could build it up to be a bit more noticeable if you wanted, so you might even be able to use this product as a simple all-over cream eyeshadow.  The product accurately and pleasantly smells like chocolate covered oranges and I find the $35 price tag to be fair for what it is.  I will definitely be using this again in the summer."

Then it blended even easier. Like swoosh swoosh and I looked like a bronze goddess in the best way. I absolutely LOVE this color. It goes on dark but when blended turns a beautiful light bronze / pinkish hue. I can not say enough great things about this sculpting stick! It’s so easy to use and lasts all day without smudging. Every time I use it I feel beautiful!  So much better than regular blush or bronzer."

The first thing I noticed was the packaging, which is both cute and practical. The gold labeling makes it feel expensive, and the size fits perfectly in my makeup bag for on-the-go use. The product itself has a creamy texture that glides smoothly onto the skin without tugging. It blends effortlessly, which is great for both beginners and those more experienced with contouring and bronzing.  The color payoff is also impressive; it gives a natural, sun-kissed look that isn't too orange or muddy. The matte finish looks natural on the skin, and I appreciate that it doesn’t have any shimmer for those days when I want a more subtle contour. Another feature I noticed is its scent — it has a pleasant chocolate smell, which makes the application experience more enjoyable, though I could understand if some people were a bit put off by it.  In terms of longevity, the color holds up pretty well throughout the day without becoming patchy or fading too much, although in very hot or humid weather, a setting spray might be needed for extra staying power.  Overall, I would say this is a solid bronzing stick. It's user-friendly, versatile for various skin tones (though the lightest shade happened to be a tad too pale for me!), and adds a lovely dimension to my makeup routine. If you're looking for a new bronzer to try, this one is definitely worth considering."

I’ve used to shape bronzing and layer with powder lasting  a Full day. It does smell like chocolate ( I used shade chocolate caramel) and not for you if you don’t like fragrances. I find direct application to face or picking up with a brush from back of the hand is easier than a brush on the product. Trying it a few ways I found that it’s so soft that it didn’t really take on my brush evenly. When applying on the face it’s pretty easy to blend out."

I feel it's a little difficult to blend with a sponge. Maybe it's the oils in the product disagreeing with the damp sponge, but it looks patchy when using a damp sponge. I would highly recommend a stippling brush or dense brush to blend this out. I found the scent a little strong, so if you are sensitive to scents be weary. It does go away quickly, but it is something to be aware of. Also, the price is 35 dollars for 8g of product. I compared it to another stick bronzer I own that has 10g for 16 dollars. Even though they are different brands and formulas, I find Too Faced does offer a more luxurious experience. I do think it does run very warm, and even though bronzer is supposed to add warmth, I do think this line would benefit for a more neutral undertone options and deeper shades as well. While I like this product and will use it until I finish it, I can't say I would spend almost 40 dollars on a product like this."

The formula glides on seamlessly, feels cool when applied, blends out effortlessly, and stays. I can build it up, sheer it out.. whatever I want. I NEVER write reviews, but for this, I had to. I searched for a great bronzer for years. I've tried just about all the big brands: Rare Beauty, NARS, Sephora, Tillbury, Mario, Pixi, Sheglam, Milk, Nyx, Elf, Nudestix, Tower, Physicians Formula, you name it, I bought it. None of them compared to this stick. It is SOOO EASY to blend, which is tough on Medium/Full Coverage foundations without moving your foundation. Once it's blended, set it. IT DOES NOT MOVE! I work 10-12 hrs a day most days. By the end of the day, my blush faded, eyeliner smeared, lip is gone, but that bronzer is right where I put it. I'm probably going to buy 5 more just so I have them. I typically don't buy a first drop of a product until I see reviews & videos from others. I took a chance on this one, and I'm SO GLAD I did! Works great on my nose contour, jawline... LOVE, LOVE, LOVE IT!!!! Buy it! But leave one for me!!"

For reference I had to apply it on a brush because it it didnt blend well when directly applied to the face. My only complaint is that the chocolate scent is a little strong for my liking- but I’m not taking a star off for that because I think it’s just part of the experience.

It laid down beautifully and spread just as evenly. Also is completely buildable if you need it! And of course it smells just heavenly with that light cocoa aroma. I didn't smell it on my skin, but definitely in the component! Ha ha!"

It's nice to have something that blends out super nice and just melts into your skin. It took a lot less effort to blend out vs. The huda which is my daily use but also takes alot more time. So the ease of the too faced and effortless blendability was a nice change. Definitely recommend. It also lasted all day and I own a cleaning company so my days consist of sweating all day long so I am always looking for long lasting products and was very satisfied. Will be using this to the last drop and buying when I need a refill."

However, I was wrong. This formula is crazy blendable. Be careful to blend quickly and I was able to make sure I didn’t have any harsh lines.   I will say this is not for someone who wants a “it’s so light I can’t remember if I applied this morning or not” bronzer. There’s pretty strong color pay off. Will look amazing in the summer trying to even out a self tan on the body with a pale face.   Also, like all too faced bronzers, it’s got that chocolate smell that has surprisingly long staying power. It can be a little polarizing so if you’ve never smelled their bronzers before, might be worth a trip to check it out first. Especially if you’re planning to contour your nose"

			"review_text": "I’m loving this Too Faced bronzer stick! Too Faced Cocolate Soleil has been my go-to bronzer for over 10 years, so I was thrilled to get the opportunity to try their cream stick formulation. I have the shade Chocolate Soufflé, which works for my light-medium warm toned skin in the summer. In the winter, I’d have to use the Chocolate Mousse shade. This product is pigmented, so a little goes a long way. You can make light dots or marks on your face where you want to put product; you don’t have to draw the product on using big, thick lines. I found this to blend very well on my skin and sit better with my other products than other cream bronzer sticks I’ve tried in the past. I don’t love the scent, though; it reminds me of the scent of a Tootsie Roll. I see the product description says the product smells like chocolate covered oranges, which aren’t my favorite to begin with, so I may be biased scent-wise in a way you aren’t. I prefer the scent of the Chocolate Soleil powder bronzer but assume the citrusy scent addition in this product is related to an ingredient(s) or formulation. Regardless, I’ll be continuing to use this!"

I have only ever tried powder and cream bronzers, this is such a change! I’ve never used any type of makeup stick before, it was a bit scary to try, but it blends in easily and very creamy! The color is so gorgeous and gives me a perfect “sculpted” look. This doubles as a contour + bronzer! 2 in 1?? The price is high, but Too Faced products always are well-worth the price. The packaging is so sleek and fancy, and smells like chocolate-covered oranges! Interesting, but yummy. The finish makes you look soo good. Tan and glowing! This basically “melts” into your skin. Great pigment as well. Worth it! Keep in mind I have a light, warm-toned, tanned skintone."
