			"review_text": "I was a big fan of their Brightening mask (possibly the best sheet mask I've ever used for an instant glow/radiance) and first received a small sample of this as a GWP a few years back. Knowing how fussy my skin can be and therefore not to complicate things, I decided to use this only after I'd gone through my pack of masks and wasn't using anything else, other than the products which were already a part of my daily routine. That was the first time I used it. I also decided to give it another try last year, again not using more than 5-10 drops pressed into my face, before my moisturizer. Both times I started to develop cystic acne and had to discontinue use within just 3-4 days. I always prefer my skincare to be fragrance-free, but this is one exception where I would have welcomed a bit of fragrance. It smells faintly of moldy cheese, which thank heavens does not linger. I did notice a 'renewed' and 'glowy' look to my skin for the short time I used it, and this was probably due to the Pitera. And as much as I believe in this ingredient (my own research aside, just look at some of the other reviews on here!) and its benefits, it's such a shame that something about it, or perhaps one of the other ingredients in it clearly does not agree with my skin. As much as I sometimes feel tempted to give it another shot, I can safely say there won't be a 3rd attempt...  ~ My Sephora Top 7 must-have list ~  (My top 7 must-have beauty products of all time, focusing mainly on my purchases at Sephora)  1.

So you can imagine my dismay when I finally made the plunge and found out that, sadly‚Äîit actually works really well. Better than the one I used to use in fact.   I will say that given its thinness, the mini size has been lasting me way longer than I anticipated. I tried parsing it out by using my Dr Jart essence every other day, but the way my skin looks and feels is so noticeably better when I use the SKII that I always end up going back to it. I'm thinking that maybe I can make the plunge to the full size and at least be reassured that I won't have to restock it very often.   I have super dry, thick skin, so an essence like this is essential for me. That being said, if you don't already need/use an essence, it probably won't be life changing. If you DO need an essence and have been thinking about trying this one, just know that it does everything it promises‚Äîfor a price."

It has made my skin feel extremely soft and look more bright and awake.  I especially loved it after using it with the SK II mask I received! The only downside I would say is that the product is pretty pricey.  So going forward, I may try to start using it once a day to do to make the product last longer.  But It is nice that it comes in a mini size for this reason! I am loving it!"

In August 2022 I saw SK-ii at Saks and I thought of going back to it and religiously used it up until March 2023 . My skin has now been the worst ever and never did it ever break out like a teenager. Literally every other day I had multiple new pimples popping out of nowhere. It was so bad that I had to go see a dermatologist for the first time in my life and she told me to stop using the immediately. I knew it was because of SK-ii because after I stopped my skin didn‚Äôt breakout and began to heal slowly but of course leaving all the horrible acne scars. I‚Äôm not the only person who has been going threw this and possibly SK-ii has changed their original formula to crap. It used to be so good but not anymore. I will never recommend this to anybody. They need to switch it back to its formula and need to apologise publicly for it. Also, I need my money back!!!"

This essence became an added step because I was finding very fine lines across my forehead, even though I'm only 23 (Likely sun damage). Previously, I couldn't find a moisturiser that would was hydrating enough to get rid of the fine lines without making me look greasy.   I've been using the essence for 3 weeks now, 2-3 times a day. I splash a few drops on my hands and pat them into my face. Don't use cotton pads as it would waste so much of the product. I kept the rest of my routine the same, but found that my skin retained moisture better, like it made my moisturiser work better than it had been on its own. Because of its watery texture, I highly recommend this for oily skin (it seriously is like patting water into your skin), and it has never added any weight to my routine.   It's expensive, but I've been using the mini size and it's only 3-4 milimeters down from the top of the bottle, so this is going to last a while. What drew me in was also that the active ingredient is the first on the ingredients list, which I have never found on anything else (at least when I was shopping around for essences). But a warning: it has a weird smell, subtle but weird and almost unpleasant, which is likely the natural scent of the ferment filtrate.   TLDR: Worth the hype, will last a long while, will buy again. Took off a star for the price."

Therefore, a couple of drops on your face once or twice a day...not going to do anything for you. BTW - this is mostly water. Save your $$ & try something different, don't pay for fancy water."

I‚Äôve been curious about this essence forever. But, like a sane person, I thought it was too expensive to even try. I did experiment with essences, though, from affordable k beauty brands to other essences that only seemed affordable when compared to this. Without naming names, I used a very well-known essence that everyone calls an sk-ii dupe, but after going through that bottle I didn‚Äôt notice any results.   Fast forward to the semi annual sale at Sephora, and I decided, sure why not. I‚Äôm 37, have barely spent anything on makeup in two years of lockdown, let‚Äôs splurge.   It was after using this for about 2 weeks when I saw a photo of me and was like .. that‚Äôs me? That‚Äôs what my skin looks like?? It‚Äôs hard to describe exactly, but basically my skin has a dewy, almost ‚Äòwet‚Äô look, all glowy and shiny. Like my face is covered in gloss. But it doesn‚Äôt *feel* goopy or sticky, it‚Äôs completely smooth and soft. I have already bought a second, much larger bottle.   The thing I want to end with is that, while this has worked great for me, I‚Äôm using this as the capstone to a skincare routine that covers all the well-aging essentials ( you know, from regular exfoliation to active-packed serums ). Before spending $200 on this, most people would be better served by incorporating clinically-proven active ingredients and figuring out what cleansers and moisturizers work best with their skin. But if you think you have a pretty complete skincare line up and are still looking for that level-up wow, this might be perfect for you."

For the first couple of weeks, I couldn‚Äôt really tell if anything was happening, and any improvements were so small that I couldn‚Äôt be sure if I was just imagining things. However, towards the end of the third week, I woke up one morning and was literally AMAZED when I saw my skin in the mirror. It‚Äôs like all the benefits had slowly been accumulating and overloaded out of nowhere. This wasn‚Äôt the kind of difference where I had to question whether or not I was actually seeing something. This was obvious, clear improvement of my skin.   I will most definitely be repurchasing this in the future because I‚Äôm a believer. I can‚Äôt bring myself to give it a full five stars though, because regardless of how good it is, it‚Äôs still ridiculously expensive. There has to be like a 100000% markup in price for this product.

The instructions on this say that you can use a cotton pad of some sort, which I did try but I ultimately preferred using my hands. It‚Äôs not bad at all. I have no complaints. The packaging is great, it has no bad smell. My skin did seem to look more clear in the beginning but I‚Äôm not quite sure if it was this product, to be honest. Although I did I think that it was. I started getting a little lazy with my whole routine, which I never do, so I didn‚Äôt give it the chance I should have but overall my skin looks and feels better regardless, every time I use it, really. Softer, cleaner, younger, hydrated,  healthier, everything! I love it and totally recommend. I received this product as a complimentary gift from Influenster and SK-II for testing purposes."

Compared to other essences I‚Äôve tried, this is a bit watery, but there‚Äôs a reason for that: it absorbs into your skin much quicker, delivering better results. It has a very light, almost indiscernible fragrance, which I like. Just a quarter-sized amount, patted into the skin twice daily, is all that‚Äôs needed.  Over the past few weeks I‚Äôve noticed my complexion is much softer, clearer and hydrated. I also really love how lightweight and absorbent this is, making it perfect for the hotter summer months.  It‚Äôs one of the more pricier items I‚Äôve tried, but in my opinion, it‚Äôs worth the splurge for how effective it is.

The texture and formula of the product is great, as it has pitera that is rich in amino acids, minerals and vitamins. The only issue I have is the price point being pretty high (at least for me). The packaging is very simple but cute - will definitely recommend!"

I thought surely that since this product is so expensive, it was going to improve my skin. Aging is something I worry about since I‚Äôm over the age of 40. But after more than a month of using this product, I see no noticeable difference in my skin.   For positives, I can say that this product did not irritate my skin, and I have very sensitive skin. I also found the lack of scent to be nice, because I am also very sensitive to fragrances. It also was not sticky, and sunk into my skin quickly.   Despite these positives, I could not justify spending so much money on a product that did not seem to deliver results.   Another thing I‚Äôd like to mention is the packaging. I am always seeking out products that use less plastic and more environmentally friendly packaging. I would love to see more brands such as this one, make the switch to more environmentally friendly packaging. Additionally, SK-II is not cruelty free. They test their products on animals. I prefer cruelty free products."

The purpose of the Essence is to prep your skin for the rest of your skin care routine and to help absorb moisture, I feel it did a good job of doing that. The Essence is very much like water in texture, I press it into my face after I use my toner. I get really red in my cheeks so I like to cool it in the fridge as I find that extra refreshing and it helps a bit more with the redness. I gave it 4 stars because while refreshing it didn't help much with my red tone but I do feel that it helped with my moisturizer. I'm also going to try this with my dermaroller to see if I can get any added benefits. I would recommend this product and I will repurchase."

I took a picture of the large size of both essences and the trial size we received. I think the giant hole to dispense product is irresponsible. We go through it 10x as fast, which makes up buy it more. Why wouldn‚Äôt they make the hole small like the cheaper dupe? It really frustrates me that they know we will be layering the product, and that we don‚Äôt need a whole puddle in our hands.

I always have reservations trying out new skincare because I have dry-ish, very sensitive skin. All my life I‚Äôve had severe allergies and eczema - the allergies often causing the eczema to be worse. The area around my eyes especially is very sensitive, so I have to be careful with the products I use. For anyone with issues like mine, I hope this review helps. Now, most people with these issues know that every dermatologist under the sun will warn you not to use skincare with fragrance, and this goes double for the skin on your face. One of the very first things I look at when determining whether I want to buy a skincare product is whether they have artificial fragrances added to it. Considering the trend of ‚Äúclean skincare,‚Äù and the reputation of this brand‚Äôs stuff being so high, I was very surprised (and a bit sad) to see they indeed have added fragrance. Still, considering I‚Äôd received this to review, I went ahead and gave it a try. To be honest, I did not use it long enough to see if it would cause my skin to have a reaction because the fragrance was too overpowering for me in general, especially since it was on my face, which told me I would eventually have a reaction if I kept using it. While some people may love the fragrance, for someone that rarely uses fragrance-added products, I definitely do not recommend this product. Both because the fragrance was too strong and because it is not recommended for people with my skin type. I was unable to use it for more than a few days because of that. I will say, however, that the quality of the product itself did seem to be very good and high-end. I just couldn‚Äôt get past the fragrance, and thus the threat to the integrity of my skin, to use it for longer than I had to."

			"review_text": "I‚Äôm a longtime user of essences as part of my skincare routine. I was thrilled to get a sample of SK-II, which has long been touted as the holy grail of skincare.   After I wash my face and use my toner, I applied the Pitera essence as my third step since it‚Äôs so light and I didn‚Äôt want any other heavier product blocking its absorption. I just add a few drops to my palm and then press it into my skin to make sure it‚Äôs absorb. I do not recommend using a cotton pad and sweeping it across your face as that‚Äôs truly a waste of product as this product has a steep price tag plus I think tapping it onto your face helps your skin drink it all up.   There is a light fragrance but it‚Äôs a pleasant one, I can‚Äôt quite explain it but it‚Äôs a slight medicinal/plant-like scent that makes me think of luxe Korean/Japanese brands, not luxe western brands that are overwhelmingly intense with a more mature and powdery fragrance.   As for results, consistency is key. I do believe this essence kept my skin plump and brightens and revitalizes it. I can‚Äôt speak to the other claims of reducing dark spots or smoothing fine lines since I don‚Äôt currently deal with that.   The only reason I‚Äôm giving it 4-stars is because of its insanely steep price tag. But I get it, SK-II ferments a very specific strain of yeast and with that prime ingredient, it‚Äôs how you get that ‚Äúinstant‚Äù brightening/radiant glow on your skin.  All of this to say, would I purchase this on my own? Yes, with the caveat that it can‚Äôt be a regular recurring purchase because the price does pain me inside. I feel like I would relegate it to something super special save for an evening where I‚Äôm truly pampering myself unlike just using it daily, morning and night, as I have been with the sample. As someone who is a few years shy of 40, I know I will find this essential to keeping my skin hydrated and youthful."

The product says you can apply either with your hands or with a cotton ball. I tried both ways and cotton ball was best. I actually think maybe this would have benefited from being in a small spray bottle instead. I saw a very minimal difference in my pores. It did help tighten them, but as for the other claims of this product I cannot say.   I did not see a difference with dark spots or anything else. In fact, my face continually had pimples when using this line.   Would I buy this in the future? Probably not. I didn't see enough of a difference to justify the big price."

I used my hands to pat this onto my damp face. I didn't want to use cotton as I figured it would absorb too much of this miracle elixir. Once applied it didn't take long to dry/sink into my skin. I've been using this for about a month and my skin is looking very nice. Dark spots have faded, there have been no breakouts, and there is a glow/brightness. Also, my skin is SUPER soft.

I tried Pitera essence a long time ago and back then, did enjoy it, but not to the point that I‚Äôd repurchase it due to its price. Trying it this time around, I noticed a few things that I didn‚Äôt the first time. The scent can be extremely off-putting for many people, but that‚Äôs expected since it has fermented ingredients. I quickly got used to it. Once it‚Äôs on my face, I hardly noticed it. Also, since more products are layered after it, it doesn‚Äôt really bother me. The texture is just like water, not thicker like some essences can be. Despite that, it‚Äôs still easy to apply and absorbs quickly into the skin. It‚Äôs very soft and smooth, doesn‚Äôt irritate or sting the skin. I think it‚Äôs a great product to incorporate into my current routine for oily skin. I have noticed that my skin isn‚Äôt as oily as usual when I apply this, which is great. It doesn‚Äôt interfere with other products (moisturizer, sunscreen, makeup). I can apply everything else afterwards without a problem. I feel like it just increases the overall quality of my skin. It isn‚Äôt focused on one particular issue like acne or pores or dullness, but seems to elevate the skin, making it look healthier and glowing. It is definitely something that I will incorporate into my regular routine in the very near future- just need to finish some current products so I‚Äôm not applying 5000 things on my face everyday. The only downside is the price point, which is quite pricey. I would recommend trying out this product for at least one month and seeing if you like it first. A little goes a long way so even the complimentary small bottle I received from Influenster lasted quite a while (day and night application). Overall, if you can afford it, I would definitely give this a try and see if it works for you! **picture taken long before writing this review, my bottle is almost finished now**"

I use this every morning and night which can be hard to do because Im terrible at consistency bu I wanted to try this product and utilize it as much as possible to see if its worth the price. I absolutely loved this one, it was simple and easy to pat dry on your face and made my skin look way less dull. I even started losing the dark spots near my cheeks close to my ears. It's def an investment so if your gonna use this I recommend to pair with the lotion toner which boosts the hydration process. I noticed a difference within about a week but my skin got a glow and plump at about day 4. I have dull and combo skin and its frustrating because some places are more dry than others and over moisturizing can cause my skin to break out while under moisturizing can wrinkle and dull/dry out my skin. This tended to balance it out and make my skin more versatile with makeup use. I was impressed and would def recommend. If you have already great skin then this won't do much for you, but for older people nearing their 40s this is a start. I also recommend getting reusable cloth pads to put on your skin so you don't waste product. Even my wrinkles lessened which I was a bit shocked about. Most products don't really work and seem to make my skin worse but this one definitely improved my skin. I actually can look at without cringing when without makeup which is a definite plus. My skin even feel more soft and supple which I didn't expect. Even pitera is the top ingredient on the list which makes me think Im paying for what Im getting not just a bunch of filler ingredients."

The essence also has a bit of a yeasty scent which dissipates shortly after application (they suggest using a cotton pad, but I prefer applying with my hands as it feels less wasteful) and the essence absorbs into my skin pretty quickly. However, the reason why I give the product 3 stars is that while I do think it did help my skin, it wasn't significantly better than another essence (that is based on a rice ferment vs SK-II's yeast ferment) that I had bought because it costs less and was compared favorably to SK-II.  Overall, if you have the money and want to try this, I say give it a go."

That is what you will get with SK-II Facial Treatment Essence. Real results! It left my skin luminous and with plump young looking skin.! There is a hang up unfortunately, as it is a bit sticky after application (even with the moisturizer) I found myself wetting a cloth later in the day and wiping my face. I'm still happy with my results thought!!"

I was in shock of how good my skin felt Everytime I follow the Sky-II skin routine process I saw results right away. I felt my skin refresh and brighter and felt my skin really different from other products i have seen in the past. You start to feel that it burn a little at first and saw little redness but it did change my skin by the second time i tried it. It erased my skin dark spots that no other product i have used in the past did. It really change my skin to brighter and my wrinkles are disappearing by everyday use. Thank you so much for Influenster for this wonderfully sample. I will recommend to all my friend and family members and I will buy the full size products now and it will be part of my new skin routine. love the packaging and love how easy is to use."

At first I had imperfections come to the surface but then the glow and even tone that emerged was wonderful. Although I broke out slightly it was very gentle and can be applied with either a cotton ball or your hands. I love that the ingredients have a long history behind them. Fermented ingredients are proven to reduce irritation. I do believe I have found a new skin care routine, I even suggested it to my aesthetician! In this case, you definitely get what you pay for (I did end up making a purchase of the line)"

It stung my skin, only because my skin was really dried out dealing with the summer heat. It goes on relatively easily with a cotton ball/round or the palms of your hands. After a few days of it my skin got used to it. I did notice a slight brightening affect, but it did make my skin purge for the first week I used it. By the second and third week my skin was adjusted to it, the burning sensation was gone and I could easily apply it to my face.   Due to the price this is not something I will be adding to my regiment any time soon. It had a SLIGHT affect on my skin. However for how slight the difference it made and the price point of this item, I wouldn‚Äôt buy it myself when I have other products that have a better outcome at a lesser price.   **picture is from PRIOR to starting the regiment I just loved the packaging on this VoxBox everything was SO fancy and looked so pretty so 10/10 for packaging!**"

I also got a chance to read the story behind SK-II and how it came to be and it is such a great read and explains everything about the Pitera essence!!

No new breakouts after the first week. Something I find shocking is that every year around this time, I get rashes on my cheeks and eyes because I live in Arizona - it's 120 degrees + sweat + dry heat that makes you feel like you're in an oven + now we wear masks. Well no rashes! No eczema break outs! Heck yeah, its a win for me. I used the Essence, Clear Lotion, Moisturizer & Cleanser together. I'd give it 5 stars if it wasn't so expensive."

My dry skin drank it up and I haven't been able to use long enough to say I see a difference. I had an exczema flare so I have had to stop for a while but plan to go back to using this.

It honestly kind of felt like I was putting water on my face sometimes. The fragrance is pretty light but to me, it still had a weird scent to it that I wasn‚Äôt a fan of and always held my breath when applying it. I first applied this using a cotton pad when I got it initially. However, I felt like the cotton pad soaked up so Much of the product and not enough was going on my face. So I tried just directly splashing a few drops of the essence into palm of my hands before directly patting it into my face. Even then, I felt like the essence absorbed so quickly into my hands and not my face so I felt like I was still missing out in this product.

This ingredient claims to have over 50 micro-nutrients such as vitamins, minerals, amino acids, and organic acids to condition skin's natural functions. Pitera can help intensify skin texture, boost brightness, firmness, reduce black spots, and diminish wrinkles Like all of my reviews I wanted to give this product a fair chance to prove itself.  I've used this product for about 3 weeks now and here are my thoughts... What I really liked about using SK-II Facial Treatment Essence is it really feels like your skin is getting hydration! When applying this 'magical water' it actually feels as it will be seeping literally into your skin!  Application: Cleanse your face with your your normal cleanser. This is good to use just to refresh your face or before putting on make up; 2 or 3 drops in your hands,  pat hands together twice then immediately pat it on your face and neck. You will feel the hydration! I also love using this product at night especially after a long and busy day because I feel like it's a nice and refreshing splash of additional hydration! *disclaimer* - it does come out fast when dispensing on either hands or cotton ball. I found this wasteful especially with the price point being so high for this product.  Skin types: All skin types. I personally have combination skin.  Texture: Lightweight like water Scent: PLEASE NOTE -  that it does have a unpleasant type of smell to it at first but it does dissipate after a few seconds. I was doing research why it smelled and it has to do with the smell of fermentation of Pitera. I actually like that they don't mask the smell with extra junk ingredients.  Price: It is definitely on the pricier side compared to other products I have  tested.  I can see why this is expensive: it does what it says it's going to do which is HYDRATE with the magical ingredient, PITERA!"

Therefore, I would recommend trying a kit of the SKII products together rather than trying to put one of these into your usual routine."

At first, I was not super impressed with this product but now having used it most days for the last month I am seeing some significant results! After cleansing and toning my skin, I pour some in my hands and pat on my face before using serums and moisturizer. It is extremely gentle on my sensitive skin, no fragrance and does feel very hydrating. Also helps my serums spread and absorb into my skin better.    I didn‚Äôt notice any harm or bad reactions on my sensitive skin, and now looking at my skin today this essence has impressed me with the great results it has given me. It has helped shrink my pores, help settle redness and has brighten dark spots from acne scarring and sun damage without being or feeling harsh. I would absolutely continue using this product if it wasn‚Äôt so expensive. However, if when my sample runs out and I see my skin going back to being more dry, dull and uneven, I will invest in this brand and purchase this to incorporate into my morning/nightly skincare routine. Right now, I am very happy with how my skin is looking thanks to consistent and continuous use of this product.    I will update once I run out to see if I decide it was that beneficial enough to spend the hefty price tag to keep in my routine."

The smell is very aery and you‚Äôre not conscious that you have something on your face because it does not feel heavy. My skin felt revived after using it, especially living in Florida it helped keep my skin hydrated. I think this is because the consistency of the Essence is not heavy and it feels like holy water on your skin.  The only thing I did not agree with is that the bottle suggests you use a cotton pad to disperse product on your face. I think the cotton pad soaks up the product and in order to get the most out of it I just wash my hand thoroughly before applying the product. I would definitely recommend this to someone looking for a mist for their face."

And, it smells like feet. I've used other fermented products, but none have smelled like this one! It's not a strong smell, and foes away quickly, but I thought I should mention it.  The bottle is a bit tricky to use. I either get not enough or way too much. Mostly too much, and it makes the essence go quickly.  Overall, I was not impressed after using it for a month.

I am a skincare junkie so I try a lot of products and this is one that really produces results. I hate to think of running out. I use my palms and press it into my skin because a cotton round would waste too much product. I have also been using the SK-II facial cleanser and I believe that has made a difference as well. One thing is that the active ingredient in the treatment essence can be found in a COSRX product. I will have to check it out.

As an accidental skincare junkie (thanks to my very sensitive skin and teen acne that became adult acne) I have been wanting to try the SK-II Facial Treatment Essence with Pitera for a long time after reading so much press and so many glowing reviews on it. But it's not inexpensive and I have spent lots (and lots) of money on products that didn't work for me in the past, so I kept hesitating on buying a bottle. Getting selected for this campaign was super exciting.   That being said...THIS STUFF IS AMAZING. It makes my skin feel plump and hydrated. It's noticeably lightened some dark spots near my hairline that came from years of wearing a ponytail in the sun at youth sporting events and sweating off a lot of sunscreen. It has reduced the look and feel of scaring on my cheeks from years of cystic acne. I will absolutely be buying this stuff for myself from here on out.   A few pointers: it says you can apply with your palms or a cotton/fabric pad, but I definitely suggest palms. It doesn't feel like you're losing product to soaking into the fabric, and there's something meditative about pouring 3-4 splashes of this into your palms and patting them together before patting your face. As for the expense, I was pleasantly surprised that even after 3+ weeks of using it twice daily, I still have a little more than half the 1 oz bottle I received left. So it goes a long way, which doesn't make the regular size bottle feel like such a huge investment since it will probably last for months and months."

The essence absorbs into the skin so effortlessly! I have oily skin, but I did not feel that this product made my face oily, which I really liked! I prefer to use products like this with a cotton round, so I first apply a few drops onto a cotton round and then I apply it to my face. It is very lightweight, nonsticky, and feels really nice on the skin! It also doesn‚Äôt have a strong scent, so if you‚Äôre sensitive to scents you will definitely love this!

It‚Äôs difficult to distinguish the effects of the individual products used as part of the regimen, I‚Äôve included an overall review for the regimen, and a review about specifics of the individual product in each product review on Influenster. I would do the same here, but for character limits. The regimen included: Facial Treatment Cleanser, Facial Treatment Clear Lotion Toner, Facial Treatment Essence (Pitera Essence), and SKINPOWER Cream, applied in that order.  Facial Treatment Essence (Pitera Essence): 5/5 My impression of the Facial Treatment Essence (Pitera Essence) is very positive. I will start by mentioning that it had quite a strong smell, reminiscent of Sake, but for some reason it doesn‚Äôt come off to me as something that would irritate people who are scent sensitive (for allergy purposes. If you‚Äôre scent sensitive for purposes such as migraine triggers, it‚Äôs still a no, but I get migraines and it didn‚Äôt happen to trigger me, for whatever that‚Äôs worth to you). This product is definitely moisturizing and softening, but I‚Äôm also quite certain that this is responsible for much of the dewiness and brightening I get from this regimen. I do not have the problem with this product bottle that I have with the Facial Treatment Clear Lotion Toner, as even though I still apply with my hands, I only get about a drop out at a time when I invert the bottle, which is what I want to prevent waste. If I had to order all the products in this regimen from most to least favourite, this would be at the top. It‚Äôs clearly the secret sauce of this regimen and makes the biggest difference. If you‚Äôre only looking to try out one product of this softening, brightening, moisturizing regimen, I would start here."

The description says that you'll notice softer texture, reduced appearance of dark spots, and more even skin tone but I don't feel like it made any difference at all. I did like that it was light and didn't feel like I had added another item to my skincare routine.  It's perfect for daytime use for that reason alone.  Other than that, I don't think I'd be purchasing again (regardless of the price point) it really did nothing that would make me want to purchase or even recommend"

The toner and Pitera essence don't seem to make a difference or do anything for my uneven skin tone or fade my small scar. They could be water for all I know. The moisturizer seems to work well, but after a cleanser that's so drying, any lotion would feel great on my face at that point. So unfortunately I am going to say I'd give it a pass. The moisturizer does smell pleasant."

Of the 1 oz trial I received, there is not much left after one month (using morning and night!)

I know skincare takes time, but after 1 month I did not see any reduction in my pore size and my skin doesn't look any more glowy than before. In fact, I experienced a week or so where my skin was way more red and splochy than normal. Of the sk-ii products I've tried I do like this the best...but I feel consistency is key. Maybe with 6 months of use this would show results...but 6 months is $210 worth of product!! Unfortunately I will not be buying this but instead will try something else. If you're considering purchasing sk-ii I would start with this, the other products I mentioned above just seem like expensive luxury items."

This essence is extremely mild and nourishing, and after pressing in a few drops as per the directions, my face (and hands!) instantly felt better. Even after burning the midnight oil, power-wearing about six layers of foundation, some light epilation, and (somewhat lazily) triple-cleansing with jojoba/witch hazel, a makeup remover wipe, and a glycolic wipe, I actually feel like my skin is clean and happy. I wanted to try a few different essences for a while now, and this one boasts that it is 90% Pitera, which is a derivative of the sake fermentation process. I'm a big fan of probiotics, both externally and internally, and this one is a win!"

This facial treatment essence is liquid like a toner. It is a clear liquid that you apply with a cotton ball or your hands. I know this is a staple and must have product for so many ladies and I wanted to like it but I felt like it didn't do much for me and also felt like it dried my skin out a bit. I didn't have a large enough quantity to see if there was any long term effects in how my skin reacted to if and whether it's anti-aging claims were effective, but my skin did feel soft and smooth while using this product and it glowed nicely.

I've been using this essence every night for the last three weeks along with my pm skin care routine and I've definitely noticed a difference in the way my skin feels and looks. If you can invest a little in your skin care routine this is definitely a keeper. Doesn't have much of a fragrance and consistency is very water like, so very easily applied and absorbed. I pat it directly with my fingertips instead of using any cotton as it results in less wastage."

It is lightweight but gets the job done. My skin is left smooth and fantastic! I was rather impressed as I didn't really expect much from this product. It is now my favorite of them all. I have been wanting to try these products for ages now but could not justify the price not knowing if they would work on me. I almost even purchased second hand but was afraid to be ripped off. I was beyond stoked when my initial confusion wore off when receiving my SK- II Vox box!! I embarrassingly mistook it for a sexy time lube brand and was sooo confused!! once I actually opened up the box and saw the products, I was beside myself. I waited over 2 weeks to do this review because I wanted to actually try out these products before making a review on it. To be honest, my skin has never looked better!! I had pizza face as a teenager and in my early 30's I still suffer from random breakouts here and there. I have acne scars that manifest in the form of dark spots and this SK-II regime has nearly erased them all. I now see that the hype is all about. I am hoping for another stimulus check so I can actually afford more of these products. Need I say more?"

I didn‚Äôt hate it or love it but it didn‚Äôt do anything special for my skin. I used the SK II lotion (toner) in combination with this and I am a bit confused about using the toner then the essence as they are both a water like product. This essence felt a bit sticky and took longer to dry than the toner. The directions say to pat on face which I found kinda hard to do since it‚Äôs water so I put it on a cotton pad and dabbed/swiped it on. It smells nice (with a strong scent), and it didn‚Äôt make me breakout or irritate my skin. I got a travel/sample size SK II product that lasted me about a week with both AM and PM use. In my opinion it takes longer than a week to see real results from using new skin care so I can‚Äôt speak to long term results. I also wish this essence and the SK II products didn‚Äôt contain so many chemicals and had more natural ingredients. And also the packaging is plastic (very simple packaging for the price) which I like less. So I didn‚Äôt see a difference in my skin and for the high price of these products and this essence I don‚Äôt think I will be purchasing this essence.

I really wanted to like these products, however, after 30 days I really haven‚Äôt noticed a dramatic difference to warrant the price point.   Their essence, the most renowned product in their line, was lightweight and hydrating, with a subtle hint of a skincare fragrance. It was my favorite of all the products received as it has I felt it provided my skin with the most hydrating benefits with the least fragrance. I didn‚Äôt find it revolutionary or anything, just more of your everyday toner of sorts.   Now ultimately it boils down to is it worth the price point? For me, not so much, but if you are a die hard fanatic or with a disposable income which these products work wonders for you, then yes. Otherwise I would recommend other great quality brands on the market."

But when used in conjunction with their spcream your skin will look amazing. I really loved how my skin looked while using the SK-II products.

I really really like this product and I considered buying a full-size bottle multiple times, but haven‚Äôt pulled the trigger yet - it‚Äôs just so darn expensive. I have dry skin and it feels amazing going on, light like water, but extra hydrating. I skip toner and go straight for this guy. I don‚Äôt have major skin problems, so there was never any ‚Äúmiracle product‚Äù results for me, but it just maintains my skin so supple, so happy, so smooth, that I do miss it every time I stop using it. The good is that it does last a long time, you only need a small amount and I don‚Äôt waste even a drop on cotton, just go straight with the palms of my hands. The bad is, of course, the cost and it‚Äôs only worth it if you can comfortably spend this amount on an essence, which obviously not a lot of people can. If you can, it‚Äôs a five star product."

The smell is faint - you have to really be focused to recognize the slight scent of sake that this product has. It splashes on gently, refreshing my skin. I immediately noticed a wonderful balancing effect on my redness-prone skin. Pleasantly, there was no irritation or redness caused by this product. In fact, my redness was noticeably reduced by using this product. I found that after applying this essence, my daily serums absorbed much better, which is a definite plus. I have also noticed a reduction in the appearance of my pores, which makes this product worth the price in my opinion."

After 30+ days of use I have noticed zero changes in tone, clarity, fine lines, or plumpness. I actually didn't even notice any temporary changes immediately after use. It's possible with longer term use, there would be more noticeable changes, but the SK-II website claims this product would improve skin in 28 days and that definitely wasn't the case for me.

Since I started using it I have noticed my skin looks more hydrated, clear, refreshed. My skin is mature and by incorporating the SK-II and Pitera Essence product into my skin care, I am seeing an improvement in the texture and firmness of my skin.

I used  about 3 drops of this cleanser and it has lasted me more than 3 weeks.  A little does go a long way.  I applied it with a facial cleansing pad.  When I 1st started using this I did notice that my face did break out and after a week I started using my pimple treatment cream. I figured it was probably the cleanser pulling out impurities in my skin.  Eventually with the use of my pimple treatment cream my face did start to clear up. This cleaner does remove excess dirt and make up and does not leave your face feeling sticky.  This is a pretty expensive product and for the price I didn't notice a substantial difference in my skin. I feel you could have received the same results with a more budget friendly priced cleanser.  Had there been remarkable results then it would have been worth the price that this product costs but I did not notice any Major changes in my skin that I had not noticed with lower cost products of the same nature. I would not purchase this product due to the price factor and the minimal results that I noticed. If this product was more reasonably priced for the results that I saw with my skin then I would probably purchase this product."

However, I can feel and see immediate smoothing effects, as well as some slight tightening of the skin upon patting it into my face. The tightening is not one that causes discomfort, but makes you feel as if the product is working. A little goes a long way and it spreads evenly. I was extremely surprised by it‚Äôs efficacy, the results reveled themselves so quickly. The smell is delightful and leaves a subtle, yet lingering clean scent. Considering that a full bottle of this is pricey, it may very well be worth it because of how little product is needed to cover/disperse on your face, neck, and d√©colletage. Overall yes this product is an investment, but so is looking young, and this does yield results. Recommended if you can afford a splurge."

However, for its high price point, I found that it did not give as dramatic moisturizing and brightening results as I expected it would. I have combination skin and issues with acne and first I noticed it was soothing the redness with a bit of a brightening effect, but towards the end of my test period with the product I found that my skin was still dry in some areas and it did not do much to improve my acne. As for the packaging, it could use improvement as it was difficult to control how much essence was coming out.   Overall, I personally would not be incorporating this into my routine after I finish the sample due to the high price point.

It's truly hard to rate each individual item, which is why I have grouped them all under one review.  The Cleanser: the cleanser was soft and gentle, and had a nice foam to it. It strongly reminded me of the drug store cleansers I used as a teenager (Clearasil). Unfortunately, it does not do a good job cleansing. With makeup, I had to do several washes and still couldn't remove all makeup. Without makeup, there was still a lot of dirt on the cotton pad used after toner.   Clear Lotion: this is just their fancy way of saying toner. Again, nothing impressive about this toner. It did it's basic function without leaving my face dry or sticky.   Pitera Essence: this is their signature product line ingredient. The Pitera essence is meant to be patted onto your cleansed and toned skin. Not entirely sure I'm seeing the results they claim. I felt they placed a lot of emphasis on how amazing Pitera is, almost like an infomercial.   Airy Milk Lotion: nothing airy or milk like about this moisturizer. It is on the thicker side, with an extremely high fragrance. Any slight cuts or open acne will burn upon application. My face was left feeling slightly sticky. Even with primer, makeup application looked streaky at best. The moisturizer truly felt like a cheap product.    Overall, the product line is cheap feeling and offered very little, if any overall benefits. This Proctor and Gamble skin line is a cheap product disguised as a high end product line. Don't be fooled. The product strongly reminds me of Proactiv, though I'd recommend the Proactiv line far over this line. The SK-II line is worth no more than $25 for the whole set, and I wouldn't even purchase it at that price point."

			"review_text": "I was really intrigued by this, as I have never used anything with Pitera Essence before! Before use, I thoroughly cleansed my face as instructed. The instructions say to shake the bottle 2-3 times into your hand, and press the liquid into your face. 2-3 shakes was all I needed. My first impression was that it felt refreshing! It also has a pleasant scent and dries quickly. I have used the product 3-4 times so far, not truly enough to see a difference in my skin yet. I will keep using the product and see how it goes!"

I would not use again. i also didn't like some of the ingredients in the product since i prefer more natural ones. overall the packaging was nice but didnt care for the product."

I would say it was a nice edition and I noticed my skin  was really nice when I would put it on and helped with my textured skin . Would keep using it and see if it helps more with the dark spots and minimizing my pores ."

I have sensitive, acne-prone skin that generally doesn‚Äôt take well to new products, but introducing this into my morning and night tour time caused zero breakouts and cured the ones I previously had. I am a huge fan of this essence and highly recommend it to others!"

It makes a difference and I don‚Äôt want to be without it for my sensitive, oily skin with large pores and rosacea. I recommend trying it. Tip: after I apply to my face I press any residual essence onto the tops of my hands to use every last bit!"

			"review_text": "I received this product for free from Influenster and SK-II in exchange for my honest review.  I‚Äôve been using SK-II PITERA Essence twice a day for about a month. I wash my face with a gentle drug store cleanser and toner and then apply two-three drops of Essence to my face. My face always felt very soft after application.   I was unsure if there was differences in my skin, but my mom commented, without knowing I was using new products, that my skin looked smoother, softer, more even, and had fewer dark spots.   I would recommend this product based on my experience. The packaging is good. I, personally, did not notice Essence having a strong scent (I‚Äôm typically sensitive to scent too). The consistency of the product is much like water. It glides on nicely and soaks into the skin."
