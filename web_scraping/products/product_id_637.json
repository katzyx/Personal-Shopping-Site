The only reason I’m giving it four stars instead of five is that some shades have a bit of fallout, but it's nothing a good primer can’t fix. Overall, the quality and color payoff make this palette well worth trying!"

			"review_text": "I’ve been wanting to try GXVE for a long time so I was excited to receive this product. The palette I received was simple kind of life - nudes with matte and shimmer. Very pigmented colors and very easy to blend. Another highlight is longevity. Even without an eyeshadow primer, these shades stay vibrant and crease-free for hours, making them perfect for long days or nights. I love that I don’t need to worry about touch-ups, even when I’m out and about. The palette itself is sleek and compact, which is great for travel or for keeping in my purse for quick touch-ups. Despite its portable size, there’s a generous amount of product, so it’s a palette that lasts. While it’s priced higher than some drugstore options, the investment is worth it. The combination of richly pigmented, long-lasting shades and overall versatility makes this palette a must-have for anyone who enjoys playing with different looks. If you’re looking for a high-quality, multifunctional eyeshadow palette, the GXVE 'Eye See In Color' in “Make Me Like You” is an excellent choice, especially if, like me, you love experimenting with your eye makeup at any age.

			"review_text": "As a 30-year-old beauty enthusiast living in Los Angeles with dry and sensitive skin, I’m always on the lookout for eyeshadows that deliver both quality and comfort. This palette is a beautiful mix of neutral shades that are perfect for everyday wear. The colors are soft yet pigmented enough to make an impact, offering a natural look that enhances your eyes without being too dramatic. ether I’m going for a subtle daytime look or something a bit more polished for the evening, this palette has become a go-to in my makeup routine. The shadows are smooth and velvety, with minimal fallout. The shimmer shades have just the right amount of sparkle without being overwhelming, adding a touch of glam to any look. While the shades are beautiful and versatile, they lean more towards the subtle side. If you’re someone who prefers bold, vibrant colors, this palette might not provide the intensity you’re looking for."

			"review_text": "I was really excited to try the GXVE Eye See in Color Eyeshadow Palette in Simple Kind of Life, and while the shades are gorgeous and versatile, there are a few issues that hold it back. The colors are richly pigmented and blend smoothly, allowing for looks, from subtle to bold. However, I noticed that the eyeshadow has more powder fallout than I anticipated. It tends to settle under my eyes during application, which can be frustrating, especially when I'm in a hurry. Thankfully, it cleans up easily with a swipe of micellar water, but it does add an extra step to my routine. Overall, it’s a decent palette with beautiful colors, but the fallout is something to consider if you’re looking for a more seamless experience. Because of this I give it a 3 star rating."

			"review_text": "I recently had the opportunity to try the GXVE Beauty Multidimensional Eyeshadow Palette in Make Me Like You.  As a beauty content creator and professional makeup artist, I've tested a wide range of eyeshadows over the years.This palette delivers solid quality. While it's not groundbreaking or introducing anything entirely new, it performs well for what it promises.  The shimmers are the standout feature—they're best applied with your fingers and add just the right amount of sparkle to your look.  The mattes, while not the absolute best, blend smoothly and stay in place. The color payoff could be a bit stronger. The compact itself is beautiful, and I  appreciate the full-sized mirror—it's not one of those tiny ones. Though this palette may not revolutionize your routine, I do recommend it as a travel-friendly option. It offers a good selection of shades, allowing you to create both casual day looks and bold evening styles.   This review has been collected as part of a promotion."

I can see myself using this product very often.  You can use only this palette to create a full eye look instead of having to use multiple palettes for one look. They easily blend to create seamless looks. And they don’t crease! I love that it’s clean ingredients, vegan, gluten free, and has recyclable  packaging. I definitely recommend this eyeshadow palette to try yourself and see! I think this should be a staple in everyone’s makeup collection."

I can see myself using this daily instead of drudging through several of my eye palletes, this makes quick application a breeze. I complete my looks in less than 10 munutes. I apply the mattes with a brush and the shimmers with my finger. You could also apply with a wet brush to make these shimmers even more intense. You can also use some of the shades as a blush. Overall I'm really enjoying it. I want to get the Simple Kind Of Life Palette too. I hope there will be more color stories in this line that come out in the future!"

The quality of the shadows is good and doesn’t get cakey. Although the matte ones may not be very good for medium tan skintone since its color is same for my skin tone and doesnt really shows that i have put any eye makeup but the glittery ones are good.

They do blend out nicely.   The eye shadow shade in the bigger pan I was able to use  as a blush.  It’s a pretty peachy matte tone.  I do like the color story, and that they included matte shades, as well as shimmer, glitter shades for a variety of looks.   I do wish it didn’t have so much kick up.  It’s gets really dusty when I go in with the brush for some color, and when blending out, there is a lot of fallout.  You definitely want to do your eye makeup first, before your foundation.  The glittery shades are really nice but with the fallout, I had glitter all over my face!   The two glittery shades at first do look very similar but they are indeed different.  One shade is a copper shade while the other glitter shade is more of a pinkish shade.  I would have preferred a different shade instead of the copper one.   The size of the palette is small, perfect for travel or for a minimalist.  The small palette does have a nice sized mirror which is great, cause I always forget to grab a mirror."

The metallic shadows, in particular, were a struggle. They were too powdery, and the glitter fallout was a mess—ending up under my eyes and all over my face. It’s more suited for someone who’s new to makeup or loves a lot of glitter, but if you’re looking for precision and a polished look, this might not be the palette for you.  On a positive note, the case design is pretty cool, and I do appreciate the quote on the mirror. However, despite the nice packaging, the overall performance left me feeling underwhelmed."

			"review_text": "The color selection of this palette is great for everyday use! You get a good mix of matte and shimmer shades, all leaning on the cooler side. I love that there’s nothing too wild in here—just a range of wearable shades that are perfect for work and school. The mattes blend easily and aren’t overly pigmented, so you can build them up without going overboard. The shimmers are gorgeous, they look incredibly sparkly rather than icy or foiled. They're very easy to build up if you want something more dramatic.  These shades work very well together, so if you are new to eyeshadow it's hard to go wrong when using this palette! These tones are also really flattering for my cool olive skin, they don't have too much gray in them so they don't wash me out as other cool tones tend to do. As for wear time, they hold up pretty well throughout the day. I didn’t notice any major creasing or fading, which is always a concern with eyeshadows. I do use a primer, so that definitely helps, but overall, I’m happy with how they last. If you're in the market for a new basic, easy to wear palette, this is it!

I love the layout and find it to be two cohesive palettes in one. I love the color stories and find them so easy to put my look together. These shadows last all through the day and don’t dry out or irritate my sensitive eyelids. I love the black!! It is a BLACK black and wonderful to work with!! Fallout is not an issue and I don’t find them to be overly powdery either. I really think these are beginner friendly and colors that would compliment ANYONE!! This palette gets a yes from me!"

The Eye See In Color Palette in Make Me Like You has a beautiful array of neutral pink based colors. I really love that this palette has a set of warm colors and a set of cool colors. I find that most palettes contain colors that are only warm or only cool, and if you want to make a different toned look you have to buy separate palettes. This is perfect for people who like to use both types of colors! The quality of the shadows are very nice! The shimmers go on very easily and pigmented. They do have a bit of glitter, but it's very fine so there isn't a ton of fallout. All the other matte shades are very nice and creamy (with the exception of the lightest pink shade - this seemed a little less creamy than the others), and they all blend really easily! Would definitely recommend!"

			"review_text": "I love neutral palettes and have been looking for good travel palettes. This one is a really nice, compact palette that gives you a lot of options for its size.  The layout of the palette is great because it’s the size and shape of a quad, but you actually get six colors because of the “split pan” setup. This allows you a lot of versatility because you get two neutral mattes, two liner shades, and two shimmer/glitter colors.  As for formulas, the matte formula is great. The mattes are soft and bendable and easy to work with. The shimmer/metallic formulas are quite a bit more difficult. They are difficult to pick up with a brush, and I cannot pick them up at all with synthetic or combo bristles, only natural (undyed goat) hair. The natural hair brush must be a builder/laydown type of brush with a fair amount of density, and even then, the brush can only pick up a little bit of product, just enough to add a bit of sparkle to my lids. I also tried to use my finger, and while I was able to pick up product more easily this way, the formula adhered to my lids in a heavy metallic way. I’m still trying to find a happy medium between slight sparkle and full opaque metallic. The packaging exceeded my expectations. The plastic feels high end, weighty, and durable. I generally prefer magnetic closures, but the closure on this has a satisfying snap and it is easy to both open and close. I also love the lid and how the white and gold “GXVE” logos are on different levels - it really gives the packaging dimension. This is a great travel palette that is neutral and versatile and would suit anyone with very warm toned skin."

This palette reminds me of an upgraded version of the ones I’d carry in high school and college to achieve glam rock looks. The neutral mattes are subtle yet pigmented and create a smooth base for the shimmers. These can be packed on to create a foil effect or blended out for a more diffuse shimmer. You can even use the dark Cat’s Meow shade as a liner by applying it with a small angled brush. The mattes can be a little cakey if not blended well, but that’s really the only drawback I’ve noticed so far. I’m keeping this in my makeup bag for all-in-one eye looks on demand."

What I love about this eyeshadow palette is the formula, color, and packaging. The formula is so easy to work with and the eyeshadows are super blendable. When applied to the eyelid, the eyeshadow colors are pigmented from the shimmery to the matte shadows. Also, these eyeshadows do not have a lot of fall out, which is a good thing because the product is being wasted. The eyeshadows is long lasting because I applied this in the morning and the colors looked stunning after a 8 hour work shift. Now, the packaging is super slick, simple, and cute. I love how this eyeshadow palette comes with a mirror because you can carry it anywhere since the colors are versatile.

I like to use the color “Soft Spot” in my crease and deepen it with the shade “Beau” for more definition. My only complaint is that I need a good eyeshadow primer or the oil from my eye lids lifts the shadow around my crease after only a couple hours. The glitter shades are beautiful and apply really nicely, however they do fade very fast. Overall this palette is beginner friendly and easy to blend. If you don’t have oily eyelids or if you use a good primer this product performs well and overall I would recommend it."

I used a small eyeshadow brush . I do tend to have oily eyelids as well as moderately hooded eyelids so that is all put into consideration of this review. I did, howerever, like to use the shimmery shades as a highlighter just for the cheeks and to of the eyelids near the eyebrows. It worked out will but would need to saturate the brush well before doing it again. I also loved to use the black and the darkest brown as a light eyeliner for a subtle line look.

The white, black and gold packaging gives a retro old school look that is still classy at the same time. For the actual layout of the colors of the palette I like that the matte transition shades have bigger pan sizes because those are the ones we will tend to use more. I like the color story that the palette has in terms of the rosy look. All the shades go together cohesively to give a beautiful eye look. In terms of the formula the matte shades are very creamy and easy to blend. The shimmers are pretty but I recommend using a wet brush to really get that shimmery look. Overall I really love this palette and am excited to continue using it for everyday eye looks! "

I love how it is very travel friendly and the packaging is very lux and eye catching. Having both matte and shimmer shadows allows multi-dimensional looks for day and night. For example, you can go very light for during the day with the the two big matte shades with a light rose-gold shimmer in the center. Or you can go for a more smokey night look with the small two deeper shades and place it in the outer corners to give your eye look more depth. The formula does not give off to much fallout and the pigmentation is truly there. I love that it does last all throughout the day! Plus the packaging includes a mirror as well!"

Very neutral and matte, with two glitter shades that are buttery and smooth, my favorites from the whole palette. The matte shades are on the lighter side so don’t expect a dramatic look with this. The packaging is of course nice with Gwen’s brand name on the front. I do think the packaging was underwhelming but I do love that they included a mirror.

I love the “Soft Spot” shade and interchangeably used for eyeshadow and two dots on my cheek for blush blending. That was the most versatile shade for me as I used it for both day and night outings. For a more gentle day time look, I used the “Darling” at the eyelashes lid and blends with “Day Dream” shade with “Beau” as eyeliner shade. To try to achieve the Korean eye makeup, I used the shimmer “Lovesick” shade and applied on the eyelid near to the nose areas and it blends beautifully. Overall, this palette is very versatile for me and I’m still exploring different ways to fully utilizing it. It’s one of my favorite palette to date!"

I also wanted to see what the shades and color pay off would look like on black skin. I was very thrilled by the packaging as it was made with recyclable material. The compact containers were also beautifully made and I was absolutely in love with it. I got the “Make me like you” palette which had vibrant red and glitter colors.  My first impression was that the packaging looked great. The palette is portable and great for travel. It also came with a mirror which was very useful. Looking at the shades, I could already tell that I would be able to create different looks from a natural, everyday look to a bolder look. The eyeshadows blended well and evenly. I applied the eye shadow without using a primer. The shades were not as pigmented as I would like. Even though I didn’t use a primer, I have multiple palettes which are heavily pigmented and don’t require prep with a primer. I was especially disappointed with the glitter shades because even after multiple attempts, I could not get it to be pigmented enough. The other thing is that the color seemed to fade after a few hours. If you don’t care for deeply pigmented eyeshadows, then this may work. Will also recommend a primer. However for the cost, I think there are better options."

I find that I didn’t need to pack on a lot to build the color up as it was very pigmented. I wore the eyeshadow for about 8 hours several days a week and it stayed on well. Of course with proper prep before applying the eyeshadow is what kept it long lasting for me. I deducted one star because even though it’s very pigmented, there was lots of fallout, pigment smeared all over the palette, and kind of wasted some eyeshadow pigment."

This palette is definitely great for beginners in makeup and for every lady who needs a palette in her purse, it is also very easy to blend! I will continue to use it and I recommend it for make up lovers! This review was collected as part of a promotion"

Nothing wrong with that, at all though! I have plenty of bold shades, and this ended up being a really wonderful palette. They’re not sheer shades, they are very pigmented which I love! I also really like that this palette is the size that it is, because I can easily toss this in my bag and touch up throughout the day when needed! The shimmery shades are my personal favorites, but the mattes are beautiful too."

Some of the colors are a bit similar but they are so gorgeous that I am not even going to complain. The packaging is stunning as well. This eyeshadow wears well. I can create an amazing Smokey eye with this and that glitter my gosh that glitter sticks! I also used the brown for my brows and to contour this is the perfect little multipurpose pallet.

First off, let’s talk packaging—this palette definitely has an upscale feel. Its design is sleek and elegant, giving it a high-end vibe that feels both luxurious and stylish.  Now, onto the shades. The metallic tones in this palette are stunningly pigmented. They really pop and deliver a beautiful shimmer that’s perfect for a standout smokey eye. However, the lighter shades were a bit of a letdown for me. They came off a bit powdery and didn't show up as well as I hoped—though to be fair, I didn’t use an eyeshadow base, so that could be part of the issue.  One quirky thing I noticed was a slightly odd smell when first opening the palette. Thankfully, once the shadows are on the brush, that scent dissipates and doesn’t linger.  In terms of staying power, the performance was just okay. By the end of the day, most of the shadow had faded away, which was a bit disappointing. Despite this, I’m willing to give it another go. The variety of colors offers a lot of versatility for both smokey and natural looks, making it a decent option for different makeup styles.   While it won’t be a staple in my makeup bag just yet, the palette’s potential is worth exploring further."

This is a buttery, smooth, and bendable quad eyeshadow palette with matte and shimmery peach shades and rose gold color. The shades appeared to be more warmer toned shades to me. The eyeshadows blended extremely well just using my finger or eyeshadow without any creasing but honestly didn’t give me the high pigmentation I was hoping for. The shades were not as pigmented as I thought and the colors faded pretty quickly without eye shadow primer or something to give the eyeshadow colors more staying power. I did however like that the eye shadow palette is a clean beauty product that vegan, gluten-free, cruelty-free, and comes in recyclable packaging. Overall, this is a good eyeshadow palette with ultra, smooth, bendable eyeshadow shades but not it is not highly pigmented and the shades don’t last long."

The packaging is pretty and I like the unique shape of the pans, but the lid is really difficult to open. The glitters are stunning, but they are just that: true glitters. They do contain larger glitter particles and are best applied with a finger rather than a brush. I think the color story of this palette is interesting. I have shade Make Me Like You, and the tones feel a bit…outdated? The shade that appears bright orange is particularly baffling to me.

			"review_text": "As a beauty enthusiast and makeup lover, I always enjoy trying new eyeshadow palettes and since I had yet to try any shadows from GXVE I was extra excited to try the Eye See in Color Simple Kind of Life palette. Typically I lean more towards warm toned shadows, however this palette features slightly cooler tones so it was a bit out of my comfort zone, but they still worked well with my skin tone. I love the sleek, modern packaging. The shadows come packaged in a compact with a mirror that makes it perfect if you'd like to take it on the go. The shadows themselves are pretty pigmented and I experience minimal fallout when applying, however they did seem a bit soft in the compact as in there was a lot of product powder each time I went to pick up product with my brush so I had to be very light handed to ensure I didn't waste too much product. I appreciate that the colors in this palette are versatile in the aspect that you can do a more subtle or more dramatic look just by switching up which shades you use along with your application technique. These shadows also blended fairly easily for me as well, though I did have to put a little extra effort in with the darker tones. All in all, it's a nice palette that would work lovely whether you want a neutral everyday look or if you prefer to go a bit more glam and do a full-on smokey eye.

The eyeshadow pallet by GXVE comes in a beautiful package - the team didn't hold back on giving it a prestige look. I was excited about the thought of throwing the compact pallet into my work or travel bag for when I want a simple eye look.   That thought quickly changed once I played in the actual product.   The pallet has 6 shades in total : 4 matte colors and 2 shimmers. The shades are beautiful but because there's so much dusty kickback with the mattes, it takes a lot to be pigmented and doesn't blend well. The shimmers are really pretty - not glittery and stays in place. You have to apply it a few times for it to show up on the eyelid.   The stars are for packaging."

The color is incredibly intense and last ALL.NIGHT LONG. No need for touch ups through out the night it's a one and done. This is just a few of the reasons I love this product but you'll see, you'll love it too. This review was collected as part of a promotion "

			"review_text": "This has such a great color story, you can go simple neutral no makeup makeup look, or all out with smokey eyes and shimmer. Each of the colors in this palette will work with the other shades easily.   The compact is made from a sturdy plastic, and it has a mirror, but it is small enough that it is great for travel or to throw in your bag.   The shades all blended well, and I didn't have much fall out, it does kick up a little in the pan, but not bad, I just wouldn’t go as far as calling it creamy, it is a powder formula and applies like one. I think the only complaint I had was that the smaller pans are narrow, so it can be easy to pick up the shade next to it accidentally.   Overall though this is a nice palette that you can get a ton of use from. The formula has decent pigmentation, but not over the top, great to build up with though, and lasted me all day long, with no creasing.  I think my favorite thing about this palette is that it gives me a nice range of light, mid, and deep shades. So many smaller palettes will skip one and can make transitions a bit clunky, this one gives you the shades you need to work with, with 4 mattes and 2 shimmers  This review was collected as part of a promotion"

I loved the neutral colors and they were anything but simple! I noticed that these palettes were named after some of Gwen Stefani's songs, which is just awesome! I prefer my make-up looks to be natural looking with some sparkle! The colors are rich, velvety, and highly pigmented. They are very blendanle and you can be creative with mixing the colors! The palette I received also had 2 metallic/sparkly eyeshadow colors. I loved how the shadows were long lasting and this color palette goes with anything! I also like that the palette was compact and had a mirror inside so you could touch up your look! The only negative thing I did notice was that extra powder did crumble off when I put my makeup brush in the shadow. It was more than what I was going to use, but I only noticed this with the bigger colors in the palette. Otherwise, this palette was perfect for me! I would highly recommend this if you love simple, neutral colors! Your eyes will look amazing!  *This is part of a promotional review.*"

I like that the shimmer swipes on easily with my finger and it packs a punch with shine. I do have to warn you that the shade 2000 goes on ash tone despite the warm look to it! It did allow me to  blend out the black (Cat’s meow) with ease so if you’re into that deconstructed spotlight eye like me or and version of a Smokey eye this is the palette for you!

			"review_text": "This is my first time trying a GXVE product, and I have to say I am now a big fan. The quality, packaging, and results were outstanding. Gwen Stefani and her team have done a brilliant job with the makeup pallet 'Make Me Like You,' which is a tribute to her 2016 song. The pallet focuses on red/brown tones and shades. It features 2 darker red and brown shades (Soft Spot/Beau), 2 light pinkish shades (Day Dream/Darling), and 2 rose-gold glitter shades (Found You/LoveSick.) This versatile pallet allows for both glittery and neutral makeup looks to shine, which I love. I always like to incorporate glitter into my makeup looks, so I'm pleased that this pallet offers two everyday wearable glitter shades. Additionally, even the compact size of the pallet makes it perfect for on-the-go or travel. Overall, it's an amazing product with high-quality, blendable results, and being a collector's item designed by the one and only Gwen Stefani makes it even more special."

I enjoyed the warmth and depth of the mattes in the palette, making an eye look kind of easy to pull off. The shimmers are beautiful, but I think they were too similar once swatched and on the eye lid. Overall I like the quality of the eye shadows, the color selection, and the pay off once worn. I wish they were a little longer lasting, but I did not use an eyeshadow primer when trying this out for longevity, so maybe I set it up for that. I will continue to use and recommend to family and friends. *This review was collected as part of a promotion*"

It’s a beautiful palette that contains six warm toned eyeshadow shades, including four mattes and two shimmers. The component is lightweight and feels sturdy, making it perfect for taking on the go and when traveling. All six shades are very pigmented and can be built up nicely. I really enjoyed how quick and easy they were to build up and blend out. I wanted to note that I did notice quite a bit of kick back in the pan but that’s not something that bothers me. I didn’t experience any fall out and the shadows lasted all day without fading. This is definitely going to be one of my new go-to palettes!"

The matte brown shades (top right and bottom left) are great for everyday use. I’ll add one of the sparkly shades if I’m going out at night or just want to brighten my eye makeup. I have found that the bottom right shade is a little orange on my eyes but perfect as a blush, especially when using it with the rest of the palette on my eyes!

			"review_text": "As much as I love big colorful eyeshadow palettes, I always tend to grab my smaller palettes when I’m in a hurry. Part of that stems from my innate need to have someone else do the color matching for me. The GXVE Eye See in Color 6-pan palette in “Simple Kind of Life” offers a balanced trio of warm tones as well as three companion neutrals with a slightly cooler slant. I’m super picky about black mattes, and this one impressed me because it stayed put all day, didn’t fade, and was truly black with no greenish tone. I did use this palette with two different primers as well as a MAC paint pot cream shadow under it, and the longevity was consistent each and every time.  Because I am fair-skinned with cool undertones, I do prefer the left side of the palette (“Simple Thing,” “Return of Saturn,” and “Cat’s Meow”) but I was able to achieve a very pretty look using the warmer shades as well. The shimmers are sheer enough to be wearable even if you have mature lids, just exercise caution when applying them because they did “travel” into my eyelid crease on the instances when I layered them over a base shade of “Simple Thing.”  Closing Thoughts: This is an easy palette to use, and I plan to pack it in my travel bag for short trips because I can eliminate eyeliner by carrying this. All of the shades blend well with both natural hair and synthetic brushes, and the color payoff is admirable. As a side note, I know it’s not Gwen’s style, but I’d love to see a true cool-toned neutral palette with soft pink and eggshell in it because these shadows outlast my current favorites from Viseart. Just a thought."

I usually stick with neutral palettes! As soon as I tried this one though I fell in love! The matte shadows are so smooth and so perfectly formulated it was hard NOT to fall in love. They blend absolutely perfectly. There's no patchiness, no weirdness with ANY of these mattes. Zero fallout. The looks I was able to achieve were some of my favorites in a long time. That said and this is the reason I have taken off a star--the shimmer/glitters have so much fallout it's tragic. I applied them with my finger on a sticky primer and *still* my undereye was a glittery terrible mess that resisted every attempt to clean up. I will never attempt to use these shadows again but the quality of those mattes make buying this palette worth it. They are the best mattes I've every used. Plus I didn't try the trick of using a setting spray on my brush before applying them so that might work."

The colors are richly pigmented and blend smoothly, allowing for a range of looks, from subtle to bold. However, I noticed that the eyeshadow has more powder fallout than I anticipated. It tends to settle under my eyes during application, which can be frustrating, especially when I'm in a hurry. Thankfully, it cleans up easily with a swipe of micellar water, but it does add an extra step to my routine. Overall, it’s a decent palette with beautiful colors, but the fallout is something to consider if you’re looking for a more seamless experience. Because of this I give it a 3 star rating."

Smokey eyes are usually too harsh on me, but I love to make my green eyes pop sometimes. So, I was super excited to be given the opportunity to try the GXVE Eye See In Color Multi-dimensional eyeshadow palette. I have the Simple Kind of Life matte and shimmer which is a neutral palette. This compact has everything you need for day-to-night looks. The packaging was nothing to be impressed by, but the product inside made up for it. I thought the colors were easy to blend and layer over one another. First, I put on the lightest color of shadow called Simple Thing. Then on the outside third of my eyelids, I blended the medium beige shadow called Settle Down over top. Next, I took the chestnut brown shadow called 2000 and blended it in from the innermost corner of my eye to the middle of my eyelids. With a small fluffy brush, I lightly dusted over the glitter shadow for a little added shimmer. Lastly, and the part I was most excited about was using my angled brush to line the top and bottom of my eyelids with the black eyeshadow. I was absolutely in awe of how easy it was to press into my eye lead as a liner. Rather than using an eye pencil that pulls on the skin, this black eyeshadow was so easy to press in with my angled brush! The powder stayed perfectly in place with absolutely zero residue or dust on the rest of my eyelid. To finish, I whisked on my favorite mascara. The finished look was a subtle smoky eye, which looked so lovely against my fair skin. If you have cooler undertones and can rock a more intense smokey eye, I believe this is the only palette you need! It layers and blends well together, and you won’t need anything else besides mascara. A few hours later I noticed that everything was still in place and there was no need for a touch-up. I give this product, four stars for versatility and ease of application."

The application is perfect since the shadows blend very well, do not stain, do not cause creases and are not powdery. It adheres very well to the eyelid, in my case it has lasted up to 8 hours and I have not needed to touch up. When removing the shadows it is also very easy since a single cotton pad with makeup remover is enough to remove the product without leaving stains and does not require friction to do so. The packaging is beautiful, and it has a mirror that is very convenient to carry anywhere.

The colors are highly pigmented so you get a ton of color and it really gives you that smokey outstanding eye or it can also give you a lightly soft natural eye set and when applying to the eye you don't really need much since the eyeshadow are so highly pigmented. The packaging was very decent and it came with six different eyeshadow matte, shimmer and also neutrals and with a cute little mirror. I really loved that the product is vegan, gluten-free, and cruelty free to protect the eye from any harmful chemicals. Overall my favorite thing about the GXVE by Gwen Stefani Eye See In Color Clean Multidimensional Eyeshadow Palette is that I was able to apply it and blend it however much I like and it gave me a full coverage for any occasion and this palette is perfect for being creative and allowing you to create different everyday makeup routines.

If you are a No Doubt fan this is a must have. I mostly gravitate towards neutral colors on my lids so this was a fun way of adding almost a 'neutral pop' to my look. I found myself loving the shimmer shades most as these really complete the look. They are very buildable, I would just not forget to add primer beforehand to really make sure that the color sticks. I wish that the shimmer shades were larger since I will definitely run out! Overall, it's a really fun palette to have for on the go or for a more glam look. I will continue using until I run out, and explore more from GXVE. This review was collected as part of a promotion"

I do not use any sprays to keep it in place, either. The colors really ‘pop’ and brought out the color in my eyes. The sparkles give it a pretty princess effect.

I’m a makeup lover and I’ve been mainly focusing my passion on eyeshadow palettes. I know what finishes and shades I prefer, but more importantly what suits my skin tone and other features. A palette could have great longevity and blendability and be unwearable for me because of the way the shades show up on my skin tone. Unfortunately, “Make Me Like You” is one of those palettes. I think the other variation, “Simple Kind of Life“, would have been much better for my complexion and I would have really liked it, especially because of its other positive qualities, but the warmer shades in “Make Me Like You” clash with my skin tone and look quite unattractive on me. If your skin has very cool undertones like mine, this palette might be unflattering on you too. I think it blended well and that the shadows had great longevity. The pigmentation was great too, and I'm sure some people will really love this palette. It just didn't suit me well. "

The shades of this shadow pallet make me even more crazy. It’s the best balance of light and dark colors, shimmering and matte shades. Matte shades blend in skin perfectly, so I can create from slightly visible to really bright eye make-up. Shimmers sparkle so bright and can be easily used as a highlighter as well. All shades are very pigmented, and I showed this fact in the video.

I noticed an unpleasant scent coming from the palette as soon as I opened it. I'm not sure if this is a common issue or if I just received a bad batch. The eyeshadows themselves feel incredibly soft and smooth, which makes them easy to blend. The downside is that the formula is powdery and see through. The shadows just weren’t very pigmented. As someone with brown skin, I found that only three out of the six shades were visible on my skin tone. This lack of pigmentation might be disappointing for those looking for bold or vibrant colors, but it could be a plus if you prefer a more natural, subtle look. I had to use a lot and be VERY heavy handed to get it to look like other eyeshadows. I would say that this palette is best suited for an every day, office type of makeup look."

I have switched up which color goes where everyday and I still love how it looks. Adding the lightest color to your eyelid allows the darker color with the gold to really give you that pop that brings out your eyes. You can also start with the gold or the darker color on the eyelid and end with the lighter color up right underneath your eyebrow and it still gives you that pop.

The shades, while beautiful in the pan, don’t translate with the same intensity when applied to the eyelid. You might find that you need to layer the shadows multiple times to achieve the desired vibrancy, which can be disappointing, especially for those expecting more from a brand associated with a pop icon known for her bold style.  That being said, the shadows blend nicely and have a smooth texture, making them easy to work with. The formulation is clean and free from many common irritants, which is a plus for those with sensitive skin. The shimmery shades, in particular, do offer a lovely sheen that catches the light beautifully, but the overall impact is softer than some might prefer.  In conclusion, the GXVE Eye See in Color Palette in Make Me Like You has its strengths in terms of blendability and aesthetic appeal, but it falls short in delivering the high pigmentation that some users might expect. If you're looking for a palette that offers a softer, more buildable approach to color, this could be a good fit. However, if you’re after intense, one-swipe color payoff, this palette might leave you wanting more.   This review was collected as part of a promotion"

The color selection is genius, making it easy to create a range of looks from natural to dramatic. The formula is creamy, blendable, and long-lasting with no creasing. I love the multidimensional finishes and the fact that it's clean, vegan, and cruelty-free. The pigment payoff is incredible, and it's easy to apply with fingers or brushes. Whether I'm going for a subtle everyday look or a bold smoky eye, this palette delivers. The versatility is impressive, and I've been reaching for it every day since I got it. Highly recommend!"

I received GXVE eye see in color multidimensional eyeshadow palette in Make me like you which has a peach & rose gold color scheme. The colors are nice and they go nicely together, in my opinion the colors would look best on skin tones with warm or neutral undertones. It’s a cute and easily transportable little eyeshadow palette with 6 colors that go nicely together and the formula is pigmented and blends easily without fallout. The finishes vary from mattes to shimmers to fit your mood or look you are trying to achieve. You can apply with a brush, or your finger and the shades will go on nice and smooth and will blend nicely together without wiping off. The packaging is very elegant and classy looking with a mirror included. It’s a nice eyeshadow pallete and would recommend it for taking with you due to its compact size and range of shades to complete a full eyeshadow look."

			"review_text": "I've provided two photos of swatches in this review. First photo is finger swatched on bare skin, second photo is swatched with a brush over primer.  Unfortunately, I knew when I swatched this palette that I was not going to like these eyeshadows at all. The first negative for me is that the formula is very dry. I have dry skin as it is, but immediately upon swatching, my skin felt TERRIBLY dry. I was afraid to put this product on my eyelids because of how it made my hand feel, but for the sake of review I took one for the team and did it anyway. The same thing happened on the eyes, of course. It sucks all the moisture out of your skin. I have never experienced this with another product as badly as I did with this.  Another major issue with this palette is that the darkest color is extremely patchy. You can see that in the swatches. All of the matte shades in this palette blend poorly and appear muddy. The two shimmery shades fortunately do not look muddy and blend better than the mattes do, but they are still not good at all.  I also find that these shadows are not the easiest to remove, perhaps because of how dry they are on the skin. My typical makeup removal consists of micellar water followed up by a good cleanser. I had to use extra micellar water and an oil based remover to get this off entirely. I have no idea how these last through the day because I had to immediately remove the eyeshadow because of how dry it is.   Overall, I do not like this palette at all and do not recommend it. I cannot find anything positive to say. If you have oily eyelids and have issues with shadows staying on your lids, you might appreciate the dry formula... maybe? Even if you did appreciate the feeling, these still blend out muddy looking. Don't waste your money on this. You can buy drugstore eyeshadows that absolutely blow these out of the water."

Upon first impression, the colors were very vibrant and smooth. They are very pigmented and blendable making it very easy to use, especially if you're new to doing eyeshadow. I also love how compact the palette is because you can take it with you when you're traveling without it taking up too much space. I like how there is a variety of shades as well as a few shimmery colors so you can create tons of different looks with just one palette. This palette is such high quality especially for the more affordable price point. I will definitely be trying their other palette with different shades!"

All of these eyeshadows are pigmented and apply easily without a lot of fallout. These shadows are long lasting which I love, because I hate having to reapply my eyeshadow constantly.   My only issue is with the packaging, it is super cute but hard to open sometimes. You have to put a lot of strength in to open it. Besides that, this palette has become a staple in my makeup routine. My favorite shades are the glitter ones (Return of Saturn and Angel Wink). I love to use the black shade (Cat’s Meow) as an eyeliner for softer wings, but it is still so pigmented!

I like to create a small wing with the black shade, use a light beige to cover the eyelid, blend a brown shade into the crease, and add a shimmering shade to the center of the lid, depending on my mood. This allows me to achieve that latte makeup look that is so popular right now and really makes my blue eyes pop!  The shadows are super pigmented but blend like a dream, and there’s no fallout.

I always look for eyeshadows and are pigmented without being over the top. I do wish there was more of the shimmer shadows since I know I will go through this one quicker than some of the other shades. The black was easy to blend out, but also held its own used as a liner.

One more pinky one more bronze. It also lasts on the eye. I don’t have to worry about it fading throughout the day. There’s barely any fall out if any. The one big thing is there’s no glitter fallout. I just use my concealer as an eyeshadow primer and it sticks on perfectly. I’d love to buy this in the other shade because I’m more into cool toned.

I tried it the first time using a regular eyeshadow brush but it didn’t seem to pick up any color enough to show I have something on my eyes so I tried a denser brush and that helped a little but it was very powdery like kind of chalky I also think primer would be a must have for this to grab the particles before they fall down onto your face because the formula isn’t creamy enough to sit nicely on its own which I was surprised because she has some other really great products but this one is a miss"

It fits to small bag and portable. I picked the palette named Make me like you which including 4 matte shades (day cream, soft spot, darling, beau) and 2  shimmers (found you, lovesick) for mix and match or just use single. It has rich-color, thin texture, creamy. So if you just want to have a soft color on eye, just need to light touch the color by ring finger or brush. I used fluffy brush to get color. My skin is oily so I have to use eye primer first for easy to blend the color later. On the picture, I used darling and beau with little lovesick shade and so far I like this look. I’m not good at matching the color but for this pallete’s shades, I fee so freely like a bird.

I feel like GXVE eyeshadow colors are more pigmented than average and the only comparison I can really draw from would be the staying power of MAC, which as we all know is the GOAT when it comes to lasting all day. The glitter in these also does not flake away like the cheapo brands do, which is the actual worst. I applied these both wet and dry to achieve different looks and the sparkly ones looked extra fierce with a little bit of a damp brush application!

As a makeup fanatic in my twenties, this palette is perfect and can easily transition with my looks, whether I be going to the club or studying at a coffee shop. The Eye See in Color palette is a must have!"

Let’s start with the packaging, the compact, is heavy and built well good quality plastic. It does include a mirror, which I think is rare in eyeshadow palettes. So it’s perfect on the go. This palette is a smaller size, which makes me instantly think it’s super travel friendly. The shadow color selection is perfect. It’s an all in one palette. You have the contour and mid neutral shades, along with 2 glorious shimmers. These I cannot cannot rave enough about. At first site of this palette, they definitely caught my eye. There is also a dark shadow for that perfect shadow liner or smoky wing. I am a snob overall for eyeshadow, and love a quick and smooth blend. I have a huge selection of shadows, and only a few that I can rely on for an everyday palette. Since I got this- it’s been on the vanity top primed and ready for everyday use. I enjoy the fact that I can do an eye sweep in the crease and liner or a full glam look all in one. The wear is phenomenal. You will definitely get the longevity here. I think the colors are well paired, and versatile this can work with a range of skin colors and age groups. I have nothing bad to say on this palette. It honestly checked every one of my boxes. I am eager for future releases!   This review was collected as part of a prom"

			"review_text": "This ultra-compact palette features six universally flattering shades that suit all skin tones, effortlessly transitioning your look from day to night.  Simple Thing and Settle Down are my least favorite shades—both are flat mattes with a somewhat powdery texture, prone to fallout and clumping. While they make for decent base shades, there's nothing particularly noteworthy about them.  Return of Saturn and Angel Wink are the standouts for me, offering multidimensional shimmer with easy application and no fallout. The creamy texture and vibrant shimmers deliver an impactful look that transitions seamlessly from day to night. These shades work best when applied with your fingers, as the warmth of your skin transforms the formula into a liquid gold-like finish.  Cat's Meow deserves special mention—this shade is an intensely pigmented, void-like black. It's the darkest black eyeshadow I've ever swatched, with zero fallout. It creates a dramatic, smoky effect and doubles as the perfect black eyeliner. Just use a tiny liner brush, and you'll see magic happen.  2000 embodies the early millennium vibe with its supermodel bronzy brown shade. While it doesn’t particularly excite me, it's still a highly wearable and versatile color."

I am not a professional by any means, but love exploring different styles and trends and creating simple, yet eye-catching looks. This palette, MAKE ME LIKE YOU, is perfect for creating everyday looks, or going for a night out on the town.  It has two shimmer shades, Love Sick & Found You, and these 2 shades are the reason I am giving it 4 stars. They are gorgeous shades, but they are way too identical in color once you see them in person. They both look like they are rose gold shades, rather than one of them being a peach shade. The stock pictures make them look like two totally different colors, and are the entire reason I wanted to try this palette. I was a little disappointed in that part, but that's the only negative thing I'd say about this. It does stay on all day long & does not crease, which is all I've been looking for in a good eye palette. The packaging is so chic, but also fits the Gwen Stefani brand perfectly. All in all, if they would revamp this palette and actually make the 2 shimmer colors look like they do in the stock pictures, I would give it 10 stars. But I would still recommend it because it does everything you would want in a good eyeshadow."

The color selection is beautiful, offering a mix of neutral and bold shades that are perfect for everyday wear or a pop of glam. The packaging is sleek and travel-friendly, which is a nice touch. However, the formula could be better. Some of the shades, especially the mattes, are a bit chalky and require extra effort to blend smoothly. The pigmentation varies, with some shades delivering vibrant color payoff while others need a few layers to show up. It’s a decent palette for Gwen Stefani fans or those looking for a versatile, on-the-go option, but it may not fully satisfy those who prioritize consistently high-quality pigmentation and blendability.

			"review_text": "Extremely powdery with lots of kickback from the mattes and fallout from the glitters (and they are absolutely glitters, not shimmers). If you've ever used Tarte's eyeshadow, it's a similar level of powder kickback. Literally one swatch per pan and the black plastic of the palette was already pretty covered in eyeshadow powder.  The color story is pretty good and offers some nice options for different eye looks, although I would have liked to have a lighter, more neutral brown instead of the medium red as a large pan, like a more tan version of the pale pink to use as an alternative base color. Or even a lighter shimmer or sparkly to use as an inner corner highlight. I wouldn't say it's incomplete, but I think a slight tweak like that would make it a little better for getting more variety in looks. The lightest shade (top left pan) is a great base color for me, and both browns work well for crease or corner application, in terms of depth. The glitters have very little base color on their own, and have a lot of fallout. They honestly look better in person than in pictures because they are very sparkly and eye-catching, but it's hard to capture without movement.   The performance isn't terrible but isn't great. Primer makes a huge difference, and glitter glue even more so for the glitters. I've never considered myself to have particularly dry eyelids, but trying to apply these without primer they somehow found dry patches to cling to. They definitely need prep work to look their best. I tried a couple quick looks with no primer (sorry for no eyeliner and lashes to finish!) and thought they blended pretty well though, just had lots of fallout and were a bit more muted. Probably not a good pick for someone who likes to be one (or two) shades and done. I even tried the large pans as blushes just to see, but I wouldn't recommend it. They both pulled much more orange-y and kind of dusty looking over a large area like that.  The packaging is cheap looking and hard to open."

Let’s begin with the mattes; they are neutral, soft and buttery with a little kickback (a little is good; it means you and your brushes aren’t going to fight with hard pan - a, well, hard film over the powder that makes it difficult to pick up product. Too much kickback is not good, as it’s more likely the product, whether powder eyeshadow, blush, bronzer, etc., will crumble). The mattes applied nicely with and without primer.   I found the liner shadows difficult to use without wetting my brush first. I used several different brushes to be certain and had the same result each time. The brushes weren’t able to pick up enough product to give more than a shadow otherwise, and I don’t have time to build up liner. There are far easier products and applications otherwise.  The foiled lid toppers were picked up nicely on a dry brush. They look as though they would be more foiled, but that isn’t the case and it’s fine.  The packaging is plastic and sturdy enough. One thing I was thrilled to find is it doesn’t contain any of those useless little brushes that even luxury brands still insist on including for some reason. They waste space, plastic, and end up in the bin the moment I see them. GXVE is wise enough to understand this. It may seem like a small thing, but you don’t have to test makeup and have hundreds of palettes to find it wasteful and irritating.  Personally, these shades, though neutral, did not work for me. I have light-medium skin tone with pink undertone. She shades made the rest of my face look sallow. I do plan to test the other Eye See In Color palette, though. I believe I’ll have better results.              kickback (a little"

People with fair/light skin will benefit the most out of it, but it will work for almost anyone if you like the color scheme. With it being such natural colors, I would not say it is very buildable because you cannot quite get the level of contrast many people like. Not extremely pigmented and I feel like the mattes can be patchy but the looks still turn out fine when I put a shimmer on top.    I have tried to play with it several ways, but all the shades looked very similar on my skin and I haven’t achieved a full look I was hoping for. Eventually I figured out the best way for me to use it is as a base eye shade and to use it with other palettes to get a finished look. Also, the best way to use the shimmer shades is to push it with a finger into your skin for it to stay. The formula is a bit dry and powdery, so expect some fallout. I use an eye primer first and it increases staying power.    It is an average product and I would suggest it.  * This review was collected as part of a promotion"

I feel imaginitive and artistic creating each look! It's my new obsession! The pigment is perfection, and the color payoff is incredible! They last throughout my day, even when I'm sweating and wiping my eyes! It checks all the boxes for me!"

I do wish that the lightest slightly gray beige shade was either more ivory or more gray. On my fair skintone, this did not show up much. However, I did use it to mix with some of the browns to get a lighter transition shade and that worked quite nicely. The mattes are very pigmented and blendable. They are a bit powdery but not too bad. I hardly ever use black eyeshadow but I created a shadow liner with it and it applied so easily and was pigmented but soft. I almost never do an all matte look but I tried it with this palette and it looked so pretty. The shimmers are a bit chunky which looks very pretty on the eye but when applied with a brush, I do get a good amount of fallout. You definitely get more intensity and less fall out with a finger application. I hope that they release more shades because I was very impressed with this and I want to pick up the other color way!"

			"review_text": "First I really like the size of this palette, it’s easy to take on a trip and doesn’t take up a lot of space on my vanity. The shades on me are a warm pink and it creates a range of light to deeply smoked pink eyeshadow looks. The matte eyeshadows are a bit powdery in the pan but blend well on the eye (both with primer and without). The shimmers are nice but since the pan is so small it is tricky to use your finger to apply them. My finger doesn’t t fit completely and these have horrible application if you use a brush. That’s my biggest struggle with the palette - the shimmers need to be applied with a finger but the pan size makes that difficult. The looks I made lasted about 6 - 8 hours without eyeshadow primer and all day with. Overall I like the size and idea, the layout and quality of the shimmers could be improved.

I appreciate that this is a clean formula and the colors glide on so easily. However, the shadows kick up like crazy and the fallout especially with the shimmer and glitter shades. This is probably due to the fact it was soft milled so it is to be expected. I just can’t stand glitter fallout and need to go back and clean up the fallout under my eyes. The mattes blend beautifully which is a huge plus. I love the fact that the black eyeshadow is creamy enough to be used as eyeliner and I really like the cool layout of the shadows. It’s really eye catching and appealing. Overall, this palette is good."

The colors are the perfect warm tones and this palette easily lets you transition your eyeshadow look from a day time eye to a night time eye. I love that the palette contains both shimmers and matte colors - thats super important to me with eyeshadow palettes. This is small enough that you can pop it in your purse to take with you but gives you enough flexibility to create different looks in the variety of colors provided within the palette. It also does come with a good size mirror. The shadows are pigmented, not chalky and are easy to work with and blend out. They can be applied with either your finger or a brush. I find that applying the shimmers with my finger is my preferred method because it helps pack it on there for maximum pigment. Overall, I definitely recommend this palette for someone who is looking for a great on the go, day to night palette."

			"review_text": "I usually gravitate toward warm-toned eye shadow palettes because it compliments my tan skin tone. But I was pleasantly surprised how the cool-toned GXVE Eye See in Color Eyeshadow Palette in Simple Kind of Life accentuated my brown eyes naturally and beautifully. These cool-toned eye shadow colors, 4 mattes and 2 shimmers, work for both day and evening looks. My favorite way to apply these buttery smooth shadows is with a brush, which blends effortlessly onto my lids with minimal fallout. I didn’t notice any creasing at the end of the day and the colors looked as vibrant when I first put them on. My favorite eye look is applying the lightest tan matte all over my lid area, the lighter brown matte on the crease, and the darker brown matte to deepen the outer crease and line the lash line. For an evening, smoky look, I like to pack one of the gorgeous shimmer shades on to my inner lids, then line and smoke out my upper & lower lash lines with the jet black matte shade. I love how versatile, compact and sturdy the packaging is too which makes it great for travel.  As a beauty enthusiast, I highly recommend this cool-toned GXVE eyeshadow palette in Simple Kind of Life to anyone who who wants to create a multitude of eye looks, from nude to smoky, with pigmented, blendable, high quality matte and shimmer shadows. *This review was collected as part of a promotion"

I do like the tone of the other shimmer. I feel like your finger is best to apply that shimmer in particular, or use a flat brush to pick up the shimmer first ,then spray your brush to get maximum color pay off. Also to lessen fall out from that  shimmer shade. . I do like the tone of the other shimmer,it applied easily to the lid.The shadows lasted all day on my eyes without fading away and creasing.

The pigment is just enough if you decide you want to keep it more subtle but just as easy to build it up if you want a more bold, glam look. I love how I can take this on the go with me for quick touchups throughout the day as well and find myself even using these shades to replace my other makeup products as well too. The shimmery shade also works great as a highlighter and and the soft brown tones work great as a bronzer in a pinch. Can definitely see this becoming my new favorite palette for everyday use!"

The colors are highly pigmented, but I noticed the glitter ones are more sheer which doesn't bother me as I love to blend the colors. The colors blend beautifully and feel like butter. The colors really bring out my brown eyes, but I feel it would bring out any eye color. The color lasted all day and didn't crease. These can easily be applied lightly for a day look, but can also be used for a more glam/night look. It's definitely a versatile and high quality palette that I know I'll keep coming back to.

This eyeshadow palette in the shade Simple Kind of Life offers a lovely mix of neutral, earthy tones that are perfect for creating both smoky eye looks and subtle evening glam. The palette design encompasses all shades needed to create a complete eye look - four matte and two shimmer shades.   While I love a smoky eye and palette, I did find myself wanting more light neutral shades as opposed to the standard dark browns and blacks. The shimmer shades are definitely more unique and fun to experiment with. I personally though had trouble creating a casual everyday look with this palette. Other than that, the quality is exceptional. Each shade has incredible pigmentation, is creamy smooth, and blends well. Also the packaging is next level chic! I recommend this product for anyone looking for a go-to all-in-one smoky eye set."

Still, the GXVE 'Eye See In Color' multi-dimensional eyeshadow palette in “Make Me Like You” truly stands out. This palette has become a go-to in my collection for its exceptional versatility and quality. With six beautifully curated shades, it offers a perfect blend of matte and shimmer finishes, making it easy to switch up my look from day to night or from subtle to bold.  What I really appreciate about this palette is the pigmentation. The colors are vibrant, giving full coverage with minimal product. The buttery texture of the shadows ensures they blend effortlessly, allowing me to easily create professional-looking results. Even after years of experimenting with different products, I’m impressed by how these shadows layer and blend to add depth and dimension without any fallout. It’s ideal whether you’re just starting with makeup or have been playing with it for decades like I have.  Another highlight is longevity. Even without an eyeshadow primer, these shades stay vibrant and crease-free for hours, making them perfect for long days or nights. I love that I don’t need to worry about touch-ups, even when I’m out and about.  The palette itself is sleek and compact, which is great for travel or for keeping in my purse for quick touch-ups. Despite its portable size, there’s a generous amount of product, so it’s a palette that lasts.  While it’s priced higher than some drugstore options, the investment is worth it. The combination of richly pigmented, long-lasting shades and overall versatility makes this palette a must-have for anyone who enjoys playing with different looks. If you’re looking for a high-quality, multifunctional eyeshadow palette, the GXVE 'Eye See In Color' in “Make Me Like You” is an excellent choice, especially if, like me, you love experimenting with your eye makeup at any age.

The ingredients are clean, which you can tell, because the product has caused no irritation to my eyes, which I appreciate, since it is almost impossible not to get some product in your eye when working on your lower lash line!

I’ve found that the shadows have impressive staying power, maintaining their vibrancy throughout the day without fading or creasing.  What I especially appreciate is how versatile the palette is. The range of hues, including both matte and shimmer finishes, allows for endless creativity. The matte shades are particularly noteworthy, as they are often hard to find with such smooth texture and blendability. Plus, there’s minimal fallout, which is a huge plus for maintaining a clean application.  The palette’s ability to achieve both natural, chic looks and more striking styles makes it a versatile addition to any makeup collection. Gwen Stefani has truly nailed it with this one—congratulations to her and her team for delivering a product that not only meets but exceeds expectations. I wholeheartedly recommend this palette to anyone who loves beautiful, high-quality eyeshadows."

I have mature, oily lids and with proper prep this shadow looks amazing and stays amazing all day! The amount of negative reviews is baffling. I assume it's either people that are new to make up or just here to complain. (A review is for the item performance and quality NOT the delivery time or receiving a damaged product) So please take the reviews with a grain of salt. Sure this palette isn't going to cause you to lose 10 lbs and win the lottery,  but it sure as heck is not a one star review. Just my 2 cents !"

I was hesitant on this particular pallet bc of the dark shades. But I followed the advice of Jessica ( Beauty Expert) and used just one eyeshadow brush. I was amazed at how effortless the application was, and  my hazel/green eyes really brightened up. I have oily eyelids, so I applied a primer and used concealer on them and used my Beauty Blender sponge to apply a small amount of setting powder and applied the shadows. It worked and NO fallout. It's perfect for me!"

This on the level of the children’s play make up that my partner’s kids used to put on me. With so much high quality make up out there, this not worth the buy even though the colors and packaging are amazing. Very disappointing.

The product photo makes the colors look more on the warmer side, but in person, the bottom two are definitely cooler. (The lower right color, looks more like a grey than a dark brown in person).

That said, the colors in this quad are ones I enjoy. My usual go-to eye look involves a just wash of a neutral nude or brown color and mascara on curled lashes.

I just want to let everyone know that I was excited about this palette, and typically I do not care about fallout. But this palette had fallout on another level. I could have dealt with that, if the quality was good, but when I tell you that I would actually rather go to the drug store and use covergirl or revlon, I am not lying. This palette doesn’t blend, very patchy, every single shade was like this. It all looked like 1 color rather than 4, because the colors literally blend away. Reminded me of subculture, except without hardly any pigment lol. You can’t pack on the color either, because if you do then it’s patchy and chalky. I am skilled at eyeshadow looks, but there was nothing to really do that could save my look both times I tried it. I wiped it off and started all over with a different palette. Not to mention, this palette is so so expensive. I am sad about this not working out, and I want to save anyone I can from buying this quad.  I really do prefer covergirl shadows over this, and I only have/buy luxury eyeshadows. I say this to express how chalky and unblebdable this quad was. And I’m very pale by the way. I can’t imagine this working at all for someone who is darker than me. Save yourselves and pass it. I rarely write reviews. But the people have to know about this one lol."

Note that this rating is only for the eyeshadow quad in Simple Kind of Life, which unfortunately, was too light for me. In the photos, I’m wearing 3 of the 4 shades (all except the light pink shade), but I don’t think you’d be able to tell. For example, I tried to add some depth to the other two shades I already had on by applying the shade “Obsessed” to the outer corners of my eyes (see photo 1), but the output looks more like a single wash of colour (see photo 2). Photos taken with different DSLR settings. I’m a bit befuddled how to use this quad on its own. It looks more like a quad that needs to be paired with other shadows to really make it work. To be honest, I have no idea what to do with the two shades on the left half of the palette. The taupe shade didn’t do much for me in terms of colour payoff and the light pink is even worse… I really wish the light pink was a shimmer instead of a matte so it could be used as a highlight in the inner corners and brow bone. I think that would’ve redeemed this palette so you could at least get a more cohesive look. All the other quad versions have at least one shimmer. Anyway, the one shade I did appreciate was the top right shade, “I Was in Love,” which is a beautiful transition shade that reminds me of my beloved shade Buck from the UD Naked palette. If I were to reach for this palette, it would mainly be for this transition shade."

My only gripe is that all the shades are matte in this palette and I prefer to mix textures. So this palette isn't a standalone option for my collection. I'd love to see how the shimmer formulation performs. It should also be noted that these shades likely won't compliment all skin tones, as these shades are extremely light."

The 4 shades all blended into each other leaving no definition except a faint peachy tone for the upper right crease shade.   Upper left- transparent pale flesh tone. Really transparent!   Upper right is a soft terra cotta shade that leaves a pale peach tone. Best shade in the quad- it showed up and didn’t totally blend away.   Bottom 2 are both a greenish khaki grey. So near each other that they are essentially the same shade. They make the entire look into a greyish blotch on the eye and blend into each other immediately.   I used my best bulletproof eye primer that always works well (Milani) and it was awful. I’ve had better quality at the drugstore.   I don’t try to rescue bad products- they go back. Things I keep have to perform without a struggle. I don’t exist to make my makeup work, my makeup needs to work every time I pull it out. This just isn’t up to my standards.

The formula is a bit dry and powdery, but I found that it worked just fine as an all over base shade. I wouldn't use this palette for a complete look, but I think it's useful to have on hand for a nice foundation/base eye shade.

I'm not a Gwen super fan (but obv love her, she rocks)--I was interested in talc-free Clean at Sephora eyeshadows. I didn't know what to make of it, but decided to pull the trigger during the sale. For context, I have light colored skin and brown hair, and this palette is the perfect shade match for me. I'm a one and done eye gal, definitely not a Patrick Ta full palette kind of person at all. The pink is a perfect lid shade, the toasty nude color could honestly work as a lovely face contour shade, the lighter brown is a dupe for Jane Iredale's cult Cappuccino shade (which looks gorgeous as a wash on the lid), and the deeper brown shade is certainly not green or khaki as reviewers state and works beautifully as a brow powder with an angled brush! The formula is creamy thanks to the squalane, and since I'm well versed in talc-free eyeshadows I can say the kickback is minimal and not an issue for me. In fact, I swatched this on my arm next to some Mob Beauty eyeshadows in similar shades, and the GXVE is not actually matte--there's very fine mica shimmer. It's gorgeous. My one ding would be the packaging--feels cheap and mine rattles as if it's about the fall apart any minute. I won't dare travel with this lest it cracks open."

I was able to swatch these in store, and to me this color story was the most unique to my collection and seemed to go best with her signature red lipstick that I also picked up.   The packaging is nice, if a little hollow feeling. Both the lipstick tube and compact are made of lightweight plastic, but the construction seems sturdy and the mirror is quite nice. This quad is a great size for traveling and fits nicely in a small purse or clutch. The shadows themselves are a bit dry, but they didn’t produce too much kickback using a flat shader and a Mac blending brush. I also tried using my fingers, application was smooth either way. I’d still recommend using a brush with this, though. . I was able to produce a really simple and flattering look with it without very much effort. I thought the shadows were smooth and easy to blend. They didn’t get muddy or stress my skin out like some matte eyeshadows.    The shades pictured look darker on the website and in promo shots and although the darkest shade has some loose sparkle present in the pan, it falls squarely into the matte category for me. The darkest shade reads as a neutral toned very dark gray, the two brown shades vary more in depth on skin than they appear to in the pan, and the ivory shade is quite pigmented, reading brighter than anticipated on my skin.   We will see how this holds up, but overall I’m pretty impressed! I worked over the Sigma eye primer in ignite, seen here worn with Charlotte Tilbury Hot Lips 2 in Amazing Amal—can’t wait to try a smoky eye with a red lip."

When applied, the top two shadows barely showed up on my lids.  I used the very light shade (Faithful to Freedom) on the upper left as the all over lid color and the next darker shade on the upper right (I was In Love) as the buffing/contour color.    I didn’t want to even try the two bottom shades in fear that it would make my lids look muddy.  I think this palette may work better for fair skin tones only.

			"review_text": "I am sharing my honest and authentic opinion as a Sephora Beauty Insider Community Ambassador. I was sent this palette from @TeamBIC and GXVE, Thank you so much!  When I saw the palette, I thought that is was way too light for my skin tone and it is, but I was able to make it work. I am sure that the other quads are better (more of my liking) and I would have rated them better. PROS: - It is a clean at Sephora brand, cruelty free, vegan, gluten free and with recyclable packaging. - I love that all the products come in clean, modern, chic looking recycled cardboard boxes that have a gorgeous design inside. - The palette box is Mae of plastic and has a matching cardboard background with white and gold letters. I find it so beautiful! It doesn’t feel too heavy so it is great to take on trips. - It doesn’t have any scent. - It comes with a mirror which is always a plus. - It looks like the the four eyeshadow pan can be removed from the package. I don’t know if it is just the way it is or if they will be offering refills. CONS: - The shadows are defined by the brand as buttery but they are the opposite (at least Simple Kind of Life) It is very powdery, with lots of kickback. I am used to ABH shadows so this is not a problem for me. - Also, the brand defines the shadows as highly pigmented and they are not. I needed to pack and pack and pack product in order to get some payoff and ended up looking muddy because of that. - Two of the shadows look almost the same once blended into the skin. This palette doesn’t allow for many looks because of the similarity of the shades and the lack of depth.  - I am missing a deeper shadow and a shimmery shadow to consider this palette a winner, but I can understand that it is just because of my taste and this one fits perfectly lighter skin tones and soft makeup lovers. - I find it expensive for the quality of the shadows."

I have seen the others in person and the colors in the pictures are definitely different.  2. This is hard to open. Not being picky, but I haven’t noticed this with most of my palettes and I did with this one, so worth mentioning.  3. Now for what matters, the formula. This is AMAZING. The mattes blend like a dream and work well together. The shimmers work best with a finger or wet brush and look so good on the eyes. The lightest shade literally makes it look like my lid is glowing.   I recommend this and I will definitely buy another!! I also bought this myself if that helps!"

It is a neutral-cool light color palette of taupes and a light terracotta that pairs very well with the strong lip color in the collection.   It gives a sculpted look that is quite natural looking and would be appropriate for work, and casual daily wear.   The colors give a perfect subtle backdrop to black liquid liner and false lashes (how I like to wear it).  That look is identical to Gwen on the website.     This shadow palette won't steal the show from a dramatic lip, which can be a good thing.    I found the shadows a bit powdery- you have to apply carefully or use your fingers- but it was not the worst I'd seen (hello ABH).   The color payoff was decent.  You have to remember these are lighter colors and will not give a dramatic look- no matter how much you apply.   I found they were velvety and blended quite well on the eye.  The shadows wore extremely well over primer.   They even survived a two-hour workout.     The packaging could stand improvement- the case is plastic-y and hard to open- and is more in line with drug store quality.   Do I think it is a must-have?  No.  I think most of us have similar shadows in our stash already.   But I am pleased enough with how the palette looks with Gwen's new lipcolor (which is fantastic) to keep it."

That shade is a matte with some gold glitter and any shadow I've ever used that is a matte with glitter the glitter falls out when you blend it. This palette builds and blends easily without being patchy. I recently bought the Charlotte Tilbury super nudes palette and I'm honestly liking this one more.  The CT black shade is just not pigmented enough and comes out patchy.  For $28 this is a nice palette and I'm so glad she kept it reasonable. She easily could have charged twice as much.

No color payoff, extremely powdery not even close to creamy like describes. I so wish Gwen had done a better job with these eyeshadows. I did also buy a liner in which I tested out quickly  before taking my shower tonight and they seem amazing. Went on beautiful. Didn’t get a chance to wear test them though."

I guess I'll have to go into a store and look but as of now I'm sending this back. It's just 3 taupes and a terra cotta. Very disappointed. No wonder none of the online marketing is showing the eye shadow palettes."

It is a bit powdery in the pan, but I don’t have any issues with fallout around the eyes. The compact is darn difficult to snap open though."

There is a great deal of product kickup which reminds me of the ABH Subculture pallete fail. The shadow is soft but has no color payout even over the Urban Decay eye primer.  Although I didn’t expect these shadows to be perfect I did expect them to be more than subpar."

I wouldn’t call this a “must buy” if you’re looking to start a neutrals collection - there are other palettes out there that have way more to offer. I like having it in my collection but think some of the other quad shades she released may ‘wow’ more."
