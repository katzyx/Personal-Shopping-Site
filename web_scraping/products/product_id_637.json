These will get 4 stars sill because they're great if you have a warm spring coloring. Please Sephora, help a Rouge client out and get some accuracy on the images!"

Very pigmented colors and very easy to blend. Another highlight is longevity. Even without an eyeshadow primer, these shades stay vibrant and crease-free for hours, making them perfect for long days or nights. I love that I don\u2019t need to worry about touch-ups, even when I\u2019m out and about. The palette itself is sleek and compact, which is great for travel or for keeping in my purse for quick touch-ups. Despite its portable size, there\u2019s a generous amount of product, so it\u2019s a palette that lasts. While it\u2019s priced higher than some drugstore options, the investment is worth it. The combination of richly pigmented, long-lasting shades and overall versatility makes this palette a must-have for anyone who enjoys playing with different looks. If you\u2019re looking for a high-quality, multifunctional eyeshadow palette, the GXVE 'Eye See In Color' in \u201cMake Me Like You\u201d is an excellent choice, especially if, like me, you love experimenting with your eye makeup at any age.

The colors are soft yet pigmented enough to make an impact, offering a natural look that enhances your eyes without being too dramatic. ether I\u2019m going for a subtle daytime look or something a bit more polished for the evening, this palette has become a go-to in my makeup routine. The shadows are smooth and velvety, with minimal fallout. The shimmer shades have just the right amount of sparkle without being overwhelming, adding a touch of glam to any look. While the shades are beautiful and versatile, they lean more towards the subtle side.

The colors are richly pigmented and blend smoothly, allowing for looks, from subtle to bold. However, I noticed that the eyeshadow has more powder fallout than I anticipated. It tends to settle under my eyes during application, which can be frustrating, especially when I'm in a hurry. Thankfully, it cleans up easily with a swipe of micellar water, but it does add an extra step to my routine. Overall, it\u2019s a decent palette with beautiful colors, but the fallout is something to consider if you\u2019re looking for a more seamless experience. Because of this I give it a 3 star rating."

As a beauty content creator and professional makeup artist, I've tested a wide range of eyeshadows over the years.This palette delivers solid quality. While it's not groundbreaking or introducing anything entirely new, it performs well for what it promises.  The shimmers are the standout feature\u2014they're best applied with your fingers and add just the right amount of sparkle to your look.  The mattes, while not the absolute best, blend smoothly and stay in place. The color payoff could be a bit stronger. The compact itself is beautiful, and I  appreciate the full-sized mirror\u2014it's not one of those tiny ones. Though this palette may not revolutionize your routine, I do recommend it as a travel-friendly option. It offers a good selection of shades, allowing you to create both casual day looks and bold evening styles.   This review has been collected as part of a promotion."

They easily blend to create seamless looks. And they don\u2019t crease! I love that it\u2019s clean ingredients, vegan, gluten free, and has recyclable  packaging.

I can see myself using this daily instead of drudging through several of my eye palletes, this makes quick application a breeze. I complete my looks in less than 10 munutes. I apply the mattes with a brush and the shimmers with my finger. You could also apply with a wet brush to make these shimmers even more intense. You can also use some of the shades as a blush. Overall I'm really enjoying it. I want to get the Simple Kind Of Life Palette too. I hope there will be more color stories in this line that come out in the future!"

I have used both the matte shades and shimmer shades both individually and together for both more casual and also dressier looks.

This is the first time I use their eyeshadow pallets and I have to say they did not disappoint! It is very pigmented but very blendable and does not flake or leave powder marks.

I do like the color story, and that they included matte shades, as well as shimmer, glitter shades for a variety of looks.   I do wish it didn\u2019t have so much kick up.  It\u2019s gets really dusty when I go in with the brush for some color, and when blending out, there is a lot of fallout.  You definitely want to do your eye makeup first, before your foundation.  The glittery shades are really nice but with the fallout, I had glitter all over my face!   The two glittery shades at first do look very similar but they are indeed different.  One shade is a copper shade while the other glitter shade is more of a pinkish shade.  I would have preferred a different shade instead of the copper one.   The size of the palette is small, perfect for travel or for a minimalist.  The small palette does have a nice sized mirror which is great, cause I always forget to grab a mirror."

The metallic shadows, in particular, were a struggle. They were too powdery, and the glitter fallout was a mess\u2014ending up under my eyes and all over my face. It\u2019s more suited for someone who\u2019s new to makeup or loves a lot of glitter, but if you\u2019re looking for precision and a polished look, this might not be the palette for you.  On a positive note, the case design is pretty cool, and I do appreciate the quote on the mirror. However, despite the nice packaging, the overall performance left me feeling underwhelmed."

I love that there\u2019s nothing too wild in here\u2014just a range of wearable shades that are perfect for work and school. The mattes blend easily and aren\u2019t overly pigmented, so you can build them up without going overboard. The shimmers are gorgeous, they look incredibly sparkly rather than icy or foiled. They're very easy to build up if you want something more dramatic.  These shades work very well together, so if you are new to eyeshadow it's hard to go wrong when using this palette! These tones are also really flattering for my cool olive skin, they don't have too much gray in them so they don't wash me out as other cool tones tend to do. As for wear time, they hold up pretty well throughout the day. I didn\u2019t notice any major creasing or fading, which is always a concern with eyeshadows. I do use a primer, so that definitely helps, but overall, I\u2019m happy with how they last. If you're in the market for a new basic, easy to wear palette, this is it!

The Eye See In Color Palette in Make Me Like You has a beautiful array of neutral pink based colors. I really love that this palette has a set of warm colors and a set of cool colors. I find that most palettes contain colors that are only warm or only cool, and if you want to make a different toned look you have to buy separate palettes. This is perfect for people who like to use both types of colors! The quality of the shadows are very nice! The shimmers go on very easily and pigmented. They do have a bit of glitter, but it's very fine so there isn't a ton of fallout. All the other matte shades are very nice and creamy (with the exception of the lightest pink shade - this seemed a little less creamy than the others), and they all blend really easily!

The layout of the palette is great because it\u2019s the size and shape of a quad, but you actually get six colors because of the \u201csplit pan\u201d setup. This allows you a lot of versatility because you get two neutral mattes, two liner shades, and two shimmer/glitter colors.  As for formulas, the matte formula is great. The mattes are soft and bendable and easy to work with. The shimmer/metallic formulas are quite a bit more difficult. They are difficult to pick up with a brush, and I cannot pick them up at all with synthetic or combo bristles, only natural (undyed goat) hair. The natural hair brush must be a builder/laydown type of brush with a fair amount of density, and even then, the brush can only pick up a little bit of product, just enough to add a bit of sparkle to my lids. I also tried to use my finger, and while I was able to pick up product more easily this way, the formula adhered to my lids in a heavy metallic way. I\u2019m still trying to find a happy medium between slight sparkle and full opaque metallic. The packaging exceeded my expectations. The plastic feels high end, weighty, and durable. I generally prefer magnetic closures, but the closure on this has a satisfying snap and it is easy to both open and close. I also love the lid and how the white and gold \u201cGXVE\u201d logos are on different levels - it really gives the packaging dimension. This is a great travel palette that is neutral and versatile and would suit anyone with very warm toned skin."

This palette reminds me of an upgraded version of the ones I\u2019d carry in high school and college to achieve glam rock looks. The neutral mattes are subtle yet pigmented and create a smooth base for the shimmers. These can be packed on to create a foil effect or blended out for a more diffuse shimmer. You can even use the dark Cat\u2019s Meow shade as a liner by applying it with a small angled brush. The mattes can be a little cakey if not blended well, but that\u2019s really the only drawback I\u2019ve noticed so far. I\u2019m keeping this in my makeup bag for all-in-one eye looks on demand."

When applied to the eyelid, the eyeshadow colors are pigmented from the shimmery to the matte shadows. Also, these eyeshadows do not have a lot of fall out, which is a good thing because the product is being wasted. The eyeshadows is long lasting because I applied this in the morning and the colors looked stunning after a 8 hour work shift. Now, the packaging is super slick, simple, and cute.

I love a universal/multi-use product that will allow me to create the perfect look for me without having to have a lot of different products at a time. I initially wasn\u2019t sure how much I liked some of the pans, specifically the lighter shades  . I want to give it a benefit of the doubt and say possibly the brush was the downfall of the application of the powder but the  shimmery shades and the top left shade  seemed to be a little blotchy. I used a small eyeshadow brush . I do tend to have oily eyelids as well as moderately hooded eyelids so that is all put into consideration of this review. I did, howerever, like to use the shimmery shades as a highlighter just for the cheeks and to of the eyelids near the eyebrows. It worked out will but would need to saturate the brush well before doing it again. I also loved to use the black and the darkest brown as a light eyeliner for a subtle line look. I let my mom use it and she loved it! She isn\u2019t oily so she didn\u2019t have much of a blotching issue.create the"

On the contrary, the shimmer shades are not pigmented at all, and feel a little gritty. They\u2019re more like glitter than shimmer and I probably would not use them. The matte shades are great for all over the lid for an everyday natural look or building up for something more dramatic. I like the color story as well, the pinkish nudes are versatile and I think they\u2019d look good on almost anyone. I do think this palette would be tough for someone with a deeper skin tone, since there isn\u2019t a very dark shade, and they\u2019re all pretty light.

I used the darkest shade, Beau, to replace my eyeliner and it works so well! It\u2019s so pigmented that I can easily draw the line, and doesn\u2019t need to use a lot. I love the \u201cSoft Spot\u201d shade and interchangeably used for eyeshadow and two dots on my cheek for blush blending. That was the most versatile shade for me as I used it for both day and night outings. For a more gentle day time look, I used the \u201cDarling\u201d at the eyelashes lid and blends with \u201cDay Dream\u201d shade with \u201cBeau\u201d as eyeliner shade. To try to achieve the Korean eye makeup, I used the shimmer \u201cLovesick\u201d shade and applied on the eyelid near to the nose areas and it blends beautifully. Overall, this palette is very versatile for me and I\u2019m still exploring different ways to fully utilizing it. It\u2019s one of my favorite palette to date!"

But I was very basic and simple this pallete was. I was able to use and switch around throughout my make up looks of the week they were very blend able with not too much fallout. That\u2019s something I look for in an eyeshadow palette. on top of that, I am able to take this pallet on the go. It is small efficient and great for traveling. The pigmentation of the Brown and the black were amazing silky and smooth patch you upon blending onto the eye. Overall I did enjoy this pallet due to the simple tone plus the mirror it carries on the inside, like a little compact travel size mirror. And the shimmer shadows were very beautiful and very butter like feeling."

I also wanted to see what the shades and color pay off would look like on black skin. I was very thrilled by the packaging as it was made with recyclable material. The compact containers were also beautifully made and I was absolutely in love with it. I got the \u201cMake me like you\u201d palette which had vibrant red and glitter colors.  My first impression was that the packaging looked great. The palette is portable and great for travel. It also came with a mirror which was very useful. Looking at the shades, I could already tell that I would be able to create different looks from a natural, everyday look to a bolder look. The eyeshadows blended well and evenly. I applied the eye shadow without using a primer. The shades were not as pigmented as I would like. Even though I didn\u2019t use a primer, I have multiple palettes which are heavily pigmented and don\u2019t require prep with a primer. I was especially disappointed with the glitter shades because even after multiple attempts, I could not get it to be pigmented enough. The other thing is that the color seemed to fade after a few hours. If you don\u2019t care for deeply pigmented eyeshadows, then this may work. Will also recommend a primer. However for the cost, I think there are better options."

I find that I didn\u2019t need to pack on a lot to build the color up as it was very pigmented. I wore the eyeshadow for about 8 hours several days a week and it stayed on well. Of course with proper prep before applying the eyeshadow is what kept it long lasting for me. I deducted one star because even though it\u2019s very pigmented, there was lots of fallout, pigment smeared all over the palette, and kind of wasted some eyeshadow pigment."

It fits great in my makeup bag and the mirror is a plus for travel. the packaging is done really really well and I see it being durable and holding up to the test of time.

These colors are the perfect autumn/fall vibe love that they can be subtle or full glam. This eye shadow pallet  is super pigmented and It didn\u2019t have much fall out on the pan. Some of the colors are a bit similar but they are so gorgeous that I am not even going to complain. The packaging is stunning as well. This eyeshadow wears well. I can create an amazing Smokey eye with this and that glitter my gosh that glitter sticks! I also used the brown for my brows and to contour this is the perfect little multipurpose pallet. This pallet is very beginner friendly as the color sticks so well to the brush and your skin. I honestly didn\u2019t even have to use a brush this shadow can be pressed right on with your finger. The formula is amazing. You get your moneys worth with this. This review was collected as part of a promotion."

First off, let\u2019s talk packaging\u2014this palette definitely has an upscale feel. Its design is sleek and elegant, giving it a high-end vibe that feels both luxurious and stylish.  Now, onto the shades. The metallic tones in this palette are stunningly pigmented. They really pop and deliver a beautiful shimmer that\u2019s perfect for a standout smokey eye. However, the lighter shades were a bit of a letdown for me. They came off a bit powdery and didn't show up as well as I hoped\u2014though to be fair, I didn\u2019t use an eyeshadow base, so that could be part of the issue.  One quirky thing I noticed was a slightly odd smell when first opening the palette. Thankfully, once the shadows are on the brush, that scent dissipates and doesn\u2019t linger.  In terms of staying power, the performance was just okay. By the end of the day, most of the shadow had faded away, which was a bit disappointing. Despite this, I\u2019m willing to give it another go. The variety of colors offers a lot of versatility for both smokey and natural looks, making it a decent option for different makeup styles.   While it won\u2019t be a staple in my makeup bag just yet, the palette\u2019s potential is worth exploring further."

This is a buttery, smooth, and bendable quad eyeshadow palette with matte and shimmery peach shades and rose gold color. The shades appeared to be more warmer toned shades to me. The eyeshadows blended extremely well just using my finger or eyeshadow without any creasing but honestly didn\u2019t give me the high pigmentation I was hoping for. The shades were not as pigmented as I thought and the colors faded pretty quickly without eye shadow primer or something to give the eyeshadow colors more staying power. I did however like that the eye shadow palette is a clean beauty product that vegan, gluten-free, cruelty-free, and comes in recyclable packaging. Overall, this is a good eyeshadow palette with ultra, smooth, bendable eyeshadow shades but not it is not highly pigmented and the shades don\u2019t last long."

The packaging is pretty and I like the unique shape of the pans, but the lid is really difficult to open. The glitters are stunning, but they are just that: true glitters. They do contain larger glitter particles and are best applied with a finger rather than a brush. I think the color story of this palette is interesting. I have shade Make Me Like You, and the tones feel a bit\u2026outdated? The shade that appears bright orange is particularly baffling to me. Overall, a decent product, but nothing exceptional given today\u2019s market."

Typically I lean more towards warm toned shadows, however this palette features slightly cooler tones so it was a bit out of my comfort zone, but they still worked well with my skin tone. I love the sleek, modern packaging. The shadows come packaged in a compact with a mirror that makes it perfect if you'd like to take it on the go. The shadows themselves are pretty pigmented and I experience minimal fallout when applying, however they did seem a bit soft in the compact as in there was a lot of product powder each time I went to pick up product with my brush so I had to be very light handed to ensure I didn't waste too much product. I appreciate that the colors in this palette are versatile in the aspect that you can do a more subtle or more dramatic look just by switching up which shades you use along with your application technique. These shadows also blended fairly easily for me as well, though I did have to put a little extra effort in with the darker tones. All in all, it's a nice palette that would work lovely whether you want a neutral everyday look or if you prefer to go a bit more glam and do a full-on smokey eye.

The pallet has 6 shades in total : 4 matte colors and 2 shimmers. The shades are beautiful but because there's so much dusty kickback with the mattes, it takes a lot to be pigmented and doesn't blend well. The shimmers are really pretty - not glittery and stays in place. You have to apply it a few times for it to show up on the eyelid.   The stars are for packaging."

I was really happy to see that the base colors were larger than the shimmer and the dark colors. These shades would work with any outfit and any skin tone. I recommend everyone give this one a try."

I also like that the packaging is small and easy to carry in my purse so I can take it with me.    I enjoyed using it and creating simple elegant and cool toned looks.    I recommend it for those looking for a cool toned eye shadow and find that the quality is great!    I like the retro 90s looking palette case, I find it to be really pretty to carry around.

The compact is made from a sturdy plastic, and it has a mirror, but it is small enough that it is great for travel or to throw in your bag.   The shades all blended well, and I didn't have much fall out, it does kick up a little in the pan, but not bad, I just wouldn\u2019t go as far as calling it creamy, it is a powder formula and applies like one. I think the only complaint I had was that the smaller pans are narrow, so it can be easy to pick up the shade next to it accidentally.   Overall though this is a nice palette that you can get a ton of use from. The formula has decent pigmentation, but not over the top, great to build up with though, and lasted me all day long, with no creasing.  I think my favorite thing about this palette is that it gives me a nice range of light, mid, and deep shades. So many smaller palettes will skip one and can make transitions a bit clunky, this one gives you the shades you need to work with, with 4 mattes and 2 shimmers  This review was collected as part of a promotion"

I loved the neutral colors and they were anything but simple! I noticed that these palettes were named after some of Gwen Stefani's songs, which is just awesome! I prefer my make-up looks to be natural looking with some sparkle! The colors are rich, velvety, and highly pigmented. They are very blendanle and you can be creative with mixing the colors! The palette I received also had 2 metallic/sparkly eyeshadow colors. I loved how the shadows were long lasting and this color palette goes with anything! I also like that the palette was compact and had a mirror inside so you could touch up your look! The only negative thing I did notice was that extra powder did crumble off when I put my makeup brush in the shadow. It was more than what I was going to use, but I only noticed this with the bigger colors in the palette. Otherwise, this palette was perfect for me! I would highly recommend this if you love simple, neutral colors! Your eyes will look amazing!  *This is part of a promotional review.*"

The shades are a mix of warm neutrals and vibrant pops of color, perfect for creating both everyday and bold looks.

The texture is smooth, and the shadows apply evenly without too much fallout. It\u2019s also a great palette if you like experimenting with different eye looks, as the color selection is well-balanced.  Overall, this palette is a great pick if you\u2019re into versatile, high-quality shadows with a mix of neutrals and statement shades."

I typically prefer individual shadows, to build a perfect palette, but this works great for an easily put together look!  The shadows are pigmented, and the shimmers add stunning depth. I love the compact size, perfect for travel, and the quality is exceptional, especially considering the affordable price point. My only minor gripe is that the mattes can be slightly powdery, but it's not a deal-breaker \u2013 they still blend beautifully. The size is compact, so I plan to use this as a travel palette, when I'm pressed for space. Overall, I highly recommend this palette for its ease of use and endless possibilities. Whether you're a seasoned makeup artist or a beginner, it's a fantastic addition to any makeup collection.  **This review was collected as part of a promotion."

I used the dark brown shade as a liner, the neutral brown as a base, and the glitter for some under-eye pop, and it lasted all day. The glitter shades sparkle and reflect light well - without being too over the top. If you want an everyday neutral eye that will pop, this is your palette. The compact is cute, making it perfect for carrying around in a bag, and it comes with a mirror for quick touch-ups. As we're heading into fall/winter, I'm excited to do smoky eye looks with this.

It features 2 darker red and brown shades (Soft Spot/Beau), 2 light pinkish shades (Day Dream/Darling), and 2 rose-gold glitter shades (Found You/LoveSick.) This versatile pallet allows for both glittery and neutral makeup looks to shine, which I love. I always like to incorporate glitter into my makeup looks, so I'm pleased that this pallet offers two everyday wearable glitter shades. Additionally, even the compact size of the pallet makes it perfect for on-the-go or travel. Overall, it's an amazing product with high-quality, blendable results, and being a collector's item designed by the one and only Gwen Stefani makes it even more special."

The shimmers are beautiful, but I think they were too similar once swatched and on the eye lid. Overall I like the quality of the eye shadows, the color selection, and the pay off once worn. I wish they were a little longer lasting, but I did not use an eyeshadow primer when trying this out for longevity, so maybe I set it up for that.

Part of that stems from my innate need to have someone else do the color matching for me. The GXVE Eye See in Color 6-pan palette in \u201cSimple Kind of Life\u201d offers a balanced trio of warm tones as well as three companion neutrals with a slightly cooler slant. I\u2019m super picky about black mattes, and this one impressed me because it stayed put all day, didn\u2019t fade, and was truly black with no greenish tone. I did use this palette with two different primers as well as a MAC paint pot cream shadow under it, and the longevity was consistent each and every time.  Because I am fair-skinned with cool undertones, I do prefer the left side of the palette (\u201cSimple Thing,\u201d \u201cReturn of Saturn,\u201d and \u201cCat\u2019s Meow\u201d) but I was able to achieve a very pretty look using the warmer shades as well. The shimmers are sheer enough to be wearable even if you have mature lids, just exercise caution when applying them because they did \u201ctravel\u201d into my eyelid crease on the instances when I layered them over a base shade of \u201cSimple Thing.\u201d  Closing Thoughts: This is an easy palette to use, and I plan to pack it in my travel bag for short trips because I can eliminate eyeliner by carrying this. All of the shades blend well with both natural hair and synthetic brushes, and the color payoff is admirable. As a side note, I know it\u2019s not Gwen\u2019s style, but I\u2019d love to see a true cool-toned neutral palette with soft pink and eggshell in it because these shadows outlast my current favorites from Viseart.

The palette packaging is a perfect size to travel or take with you but not so small that it feels like a mini. The colors are very rich and pigmented. You can create a cool tones or warm toned look. It\u2019s very versatile allowing you to do a full glam look or just a light pinky natural look. The shadows are very soft and creamy making it blend effortlessly. The shadows stay on and do not crease after long wear. A huge bonus of this eyeshadow palette is that it\u2019s cruelty free, clean ingredients, and made with recycled materials. This palette can also be refilled with replacement shadows when it becomes empty."

I usually stick with neutral palettes! As soon as I tried this one though I fell in love! The matte shadows are so smooth and so perfectly formulated it was hard NOT to fall in love. They blend absolutely perfectly. There's no patchiness, no weirdness with ANY of these mattes. Zero fallout. The looks I was able to achieve were some of my favorites in a long time. That said and this is the reason I have taken off a star--the shimmer/glitters have so much fallout it's tragic. I applied them with my finger on a sticky primer and *still* my undereye was a glittery terrible mess that resisted every attempt to clean up. I will never attempt to use these shadows again but the quality of those mattes make buying this palette worth it. They are the best mattes I've every used. Plus I didn't try the trick of using a setting spray on my brush before applying them so that might work."

The colors are richly pigmented and blend smoothly, allowing for a range of looks, from subtle to bold. However, I noticed that the eyeshadow has more powder fallout than I anticipated. It tends to settle under my eyes during application, which can be frustrating, especially when I'm in a hurry. Thankfully, it cleans up easily with a swipe of micellar water, but it does add an extra step to my routine. Overall, it\u2019s a decent palette with beautiful colors, but the fallout is something to consider if you\u2019re looking for a more seamless experience. Because of this I give it a 3 star rating."

Smokey eyes are usually too harsh on me, but I love to make my green eyes pop sometimes. So, I was super excited to be given the opportunity to try the GXVE Eye See In Color Multi-dimensional eyeshadow palette. I have the Simple Kind of Life matte and shimmer which is a neutral palette. This compact has everything you need for day-to-night looks. The packaging was nothing to be impressed by, but the product inside made up for it. I thought the colors were easy to blend and layer over one another. First, I put on the lightest color of shadow called Simple Thing. Then on the outside third of my eyelids, I blended the medium beige shadow called Settle Down over top. Next, I took the chestnut brown shadow called 2000 and blended it in from the innermost corner of my eye to the middle of my eyelids. With a small fluffy brush, I lightly dusted over the glitter shadow for a little added shimmer. Lastly, and the part I was most excited about was using my angled brush to line the top and bottom of my eyelids with the black eyeshadow. I was absolutely in awe of how easy it was to press into my eye lead as a liner. Rather than using an eye pencil that pulls on the skin, this black eyeshadow was so easy to press in with my angled brush! The powder stayed perfectly in place with absolutely zero residue or dust on the rest of my eyelid. To finish, I whisked on my favorite mascara. The finished look was a subtle smoky eye, which looked so lovely against my fair skin. If you have cooler undertones and can rock a more intense smokey eye, I believe this is the only palette you need! It layers and blends well together, and you won\u2019t need anything else besides mascara. A few hours later I noticed that everything was still in place and there was no need for a touch-up. I give this product, four stars for versatility and ease of application."

I plan to continue using this and trying more of Gwen\u2019s products because of how much I love this one! It\u2019s also in a really pretty case/package so I\u2019ll keep that even after the shadow is gone..just because lol. I\u2019ve loved Gwen for a long time and I was so excited to try this.

This Gxve palette has beautiful sparkly and pinkish/skin tone shades. It contains exactly the colors that I use in my everyday life so I was psyched to give it a shot.  The consistency is very spreadable and easy to apply to my eyelids and eye areas. I applied it before work and it stayed in place until after work. I do not use any sprays to keep it in place, either. The colors really \u2018pop\u2019 and brought out the color in my eyes. The sparkles give it a pretty princess effect.

I\u2019m a makeup lover and I\u2019ve been mainly focusing my passion on eyeshadow palettes. I know what finishes and shades I prefer, but more importantly what suits my skin tone and other features. A palette could have great longevity and blendability and be unwearable for me because of the way the shades show up on my skin tone. Unfortunately, \u201cMake Me Like You\u201d is one of those palettes. I think the other variation, \u201cSimple Kind of Life\u201c, would have been much better for my complexion and I would have really liked it, especially because of its other positive qualities, but the warmer shades in \u201cMake Me Like You\u201d clash with my skin tone and look quite unattractive on me. If your skin has very cool undertones like mine, this palette might be unflattering on you too. I think it blended well and that the shadows had great longevity. The pigmentation was great too, and I'm sure some people will really love this palette. It just didn't suit me well. "

The shades of this shadow pallet make me even more crazy. It\u2019s the best balance of light and dark colors, shimmering and matte shades. Matte shades blend in skin perfectly, so I can create from slightly visible to really bright eye make-up. Shimmers sparkle so bright and can be easily used as a highlighter as well. All shades are very pigmented, and I showed this fact in the video.  Now it\u2019s my favorite shadow pallet, which I often put in my purse, to make my eyes, when I don\u2019t have enough time to do it at home.

I noticed an unpleasant scent coming from the palette as soon as I opened it. I'm not sure if this is a common issue or if I just received a bad batch. The eyeshadows themselves feel incredibly soft and smooth, which makes them easy to blend. The downside is that the formula is powdery and see through. The shadows just weren\u2019t very pigmented. As someone with brown skin, I found that only three out of the six shades were visible on my skin tone. This lack of pigmentation might be disappointing for those looking for bold or vibrant colors, but it could be a plus if you prefer a more natural, subtle look. I had to use a lot and be VERY heavy handed to get it to look like other eyeshadows. I would say that this palette is best suited for an every day, office type of makeup look."

I got some of the eyeshadow in my eye as well. The colors were very pretty, but I wished I had received the other one, I think that one had run out. So I got this one instead.

The palette comes with six shades, two bigger pans of the base colors and four smaller pans with varying colors ranging from mauve to a rich, warm brown. There are two shimmer shades: a gold and a pink. The colors can take you from an office casual daytime look to a smoky, sultry evening look with just the addition of one of the deeper shades.

I have switched up which color goes where everyday and I still love how it looks. Adding the lightest color to your eyelid allows the darker color with the gold to really give you that pop that brings out your eyes. You can also start with the gold or the darker color on the eyelid and end with the lighter color up right underneath your eyebrow and it still gives you that pop. It's not too overpowering but yet noticeable and natural. This product is definitely a must have. This review was collected as part of a promotion."

However, while the palette promises multidimensional color and high-impact pigmentation, the actual performance can be a bit underwhelming, particularly regarding the pigment payoff. The shades, while beautiful in the pan, don\u2019t translate with the same intensity when applied to the eyelid. You might find that you need to layer the shadows multiple times to achieve the desired vibrancy, which can be disappointing, especially for those expecting more from a brand associated with a pop icon known for her bold style.  That being said, the shadows blend nicely and have a smooth texture, making them easy to work with. The formulation is clean and free from many common irritants, which is a plus for those with sensitive skin. The shimmery shades, in particular, do offer a lovely sheen that catches the light beautifully, but the overall impact is softer than some might prefer.  In conclusion, the GXVE Eye See in Color Palette in Make Me Like You has its strengths in terms of blendability and aesthetic appeal, but it falls short in delivering the high pigmentation that some users might expect. If you're looking for a palette that offers a softer, more buildable approach to color, this could be a good fit. However, if you\u2019re after intense, one-swipe color payoff, this palette might leave you wanting more.   This review was collected as part of a promotion"

I received GXVE eye see in color multidimensional eyeshadow palette in Make me like you which has a peach & rose gold color scheme. The colors are nice and they go nicely together, in my opinion the colors would look best on skin tones with warm or neutral undertones. It\u2019s a cute and easily transportable little eyeshadow palette with 6 colors that go nicely together and the formula is pigmented and blends easily without fallout. The finishes vary from mattes to shimmers to fit your mood or look you are trying to achieve. You can apply with a brush, or your finger and the shades will go on nice and smooth and will blend nicely together without wiping off. The packaging is very elegant and classy looking with a mirror included. It\u2019s a nice eyeshadow pallete and would recommend it for taking with you due to its compact size and range of shades to complete a full eyeshadow look."

            "review_text": "I've provided two photos of swatches in this review. First photo is finger swatched on bare skin, second photo is swatched with a brush over primer.  Unfortunately, I knew when I swatched this palette that I was not going to like these eyeshadows at all. The first negative for me is that the formula is very dry. I have dry skin as it is, but immediately upon swatching, my skin felt TERRIBLY dry. I was afraid to put this product on my eyelids because of how it made my hand feel, but for the sake of review I took one for the team and did it anyway. The same thing happened on the eyes, of course. It sucks all the moisture out of your skin. I have never experienced this with another product as badly as I did with this.  Another major issue with this palette is that the darkest color is extremely patchy. You can see that in the swatches. All of the matte shades in this palette blend poorly and appear muddy. The two shimmery shades fortunately do not look muddy and blend better than the mattes do, but they are still not good at all.  I also find that these shadows are not the easiest to remove, perhaps because of how dry they are on the skin. My typical makeup removal consists of micellar water followed up by a good cleanser. I had to use extra micellar water and an oil based remover to get this off entirely. I have no idea how these last through the day because I had to immediately remove the eyeshadow because of how dry it is.   Overall, I do not like this palette at all and do not recommend it. I cannot find anything positive to say. If you have oily eyelids and have issues with shadows staying on your lids, you might appreciate the dry formula... maybe? Even if you did appreciate the feeling, these still blend out muddy looking. Don't waste your money on this. You can buy drugstore eyeshadows that absolutely blow these out of the water."

I also love how compact the palette is because you can take it with you when you're traveling without it taking up too much space. I like how there is a variety of shades as well as a few shimmery colors so you can create tons of different looks with just one palette.

All of these eyeshadows are pigmented and apply easily without a lot of fallout. These shadows are long lasting which I love, because I hate having to reapply my eyeshadow constantly.   My only issue is with the packaging, it is super cute but hard to open sometimes. You have to put a lot of strength in to open it. Besides that, this palette has become a staple in my makeup routine. My favorite shades are the glitter ones (Return of Saturn and Angel Wink). I love to use the black shade (Cat\u2019s Meow) as an eyeliner for softer wings, but it is still so pigmented!

This allows me to achieve that latte makeup look that is so popular right now and really makes my blue eyes pop!  The shadows are super pigmented but blend like a dream, and there\u2019s no fallout.

I appreciate that these eye shadows and talc free and I do not need to worry about them irritating the Anatole skin around my eyes. I always look for eyeshadows and are pigmented without being over the top. I do wish there was more of the shimmer shadows since I know I will go through this one quicker than some of the other shades. The black was easy to blend out, but also held its own used as a liner. Paired with a primer these shadows to do not budge! After all day wear the color stayed and did not wear off in the creases."

I tried it the first time using a regular eyeshadow brush but it didn\u2019t seem to pick up any color enough to show I have something on my eyes so I tried a denser brush and that helped a little but it was very powdery like kind of chalky I also think primer would be a must have for this to grab the particles before they fall down onto your face because the formula isn\u2019t creamy enough to sit nicely on its own which I was surprised because she has some other really great products but this one is a miss"

It has rich-color, thin texture, creamy. So if you just want to have a soft color on eye, just need to light touch the color by ring finger or brush. I used fluffy brush to get color. My skin is oily so I have to use eye primer first for easy to blend the color later. On the picture, I used darling and beau with little lovesick shade and so far I like this look.

I feel like GXVE eyeshadow colors are more pigmented than average and the only comparison I can really draw from would be the staying power of MAC, which as we all know is the GOAT when it comes to lasting all day. The glitter in these also does not flake away like the cheapo brands do, which is the actual worst. I applied these both wet and dry to achieve different looks and the sparkly ones looked extra fierce with a little bit of a damp brush application!

It's a perfect everyday look kind of eyeshadow palette. It also fits in my bag so it's become my favorite to take with me on the go!! The colors all work really well together, it's creamy, pigmented, and I was pleasantly impressed with how blendable it is!! To create this look I used all the matte shades. I did swatch the shimmers and they are beautiful and multi-dimensional!! It's also vegan, cruelty free, and gluten free.. which is very demure, very mindful, very cutesy LOL. I love the packaging it's super cute but did we really expect anything less from an icon like Gwen Stefani!! I can't wait to get more products from this makeup line!! I definitely recommend this one!!"

I have used every single color on this palette and it has given me a huge variety of looks from a modest business look to a provocative, sexy and confident look for a date night. I absolutely adore the shimmery tones as well as the more understated neutrals and I really love how it gives me a great look for many hours without having to touch up or reapply.

Still, the GXVE 'Eye See In Color' multi-dimensional eyeshadow palette in \u201cMake Me Like You\u201d truly stands out. This palette has become a go-to in my collection for its exceptional versatility and quality. With six beautifully curated shades, it offers a perfect blend of matte and shimmer finishes, making it easy to switch up my look from day to night or from subtle to bold.

The buttery texture of the shadows ensures they blend effortlessly, allowing me to easily create professional-looking results. Even after years of experimenting with different products, I\u2019m impressed by how these shadows layer and blend to add depth and dimension without any fallout. It\u2019s ideal whether you\u2019re just starting with makeup or have been playing with it for decades like I have.  Another highlight is longevity. Even without an eyeshadow primer, these shades stay vibrant and crease-free for hours, making them perfect for long days or nights. I love that I don\u2019t need to worry about touch-ups, even when I\u2019m out and about.  The palette itself is sleek and compact, which is great for travel or for keeping in my purse for quick touch-ups. Despite its portable size, there\u2019s a generous amount of product, so it\u2019s a palette that lasts.  While it\u2019s priced higher than some drugstore options, the investment is worth it. The combination of richly pigmented, long-lasting shades and overall versatility makes this palette a must-have for anyone who enjoys playing with different looks. If you\u2019re looking for a high-quality, multifunctional eyeshadow palette, the GXVE 'Eye See In Color' in \u201cMake Me Like You\u201d is an excellent choice, especially if, like me, you love experimenting with your eye makeup at any age.

Let\u2019s start with the packaging, the compact, is heavy and built well good quality plastic. It does include a mirror, which I think is rare in eyeshadow palettes. So it\u2019s perfect on the go. This palette is a smaller size, which makes me instantly think it\u2019s super travel friendly. The shadow color selection is perfect. It\u2019s an all in one palette. You have the contour and mid neutral shades, along with 2 glorious shimmers. These I cannot cannot rave enough about. At first site of this palette, they definitely caught my eye. There is also a dark shadow for that perfect shadow liner or smoky wing. I am a snob overall for eyeshadow, and love a quick and smooth blend. I have a huge selection of shadows, and only a few that I can rely on for an everyday palette. Since I got this- it\u2019s been on the vanity top primed and ready for everyday use. I enjoy the fact that I can do an eye sweep in the crease and liner or a full glam look all in one. The wear is phenomenal. You will definitely get the longevity here. I think the colors are well paired, and versatile this can work with a range of skin colors and age groups. I have nothing bad to say on this palette. It honestly checked every one of my boxes. I am eager for future releases!   This review was collected as part of a prom"

Simple Thing and Settle Down are my least favorite shades\u2014both are flat mattes with a somewhat powdery texture, prone to fallout and clumping. While they make for decent base shades, there's nothing particularly noteworthy about them.  Return of Saturn and Angel Wink are the standouts for me, offering multidimensional shimmer with easy application and no fallout. The creamy texture and vibrant shimmers deliver an impactful look that transitions seamlessly from day to night. These shades work best when applied with your fingers, as the warmth of your skin transforms the formula into a liquid gold-like finish.  Cat's Meow deserves special mention\u2014this shade is an intensely pigmented, void-like black. It's the darkest black eyeshadow I've ever swatched, with zero fallout. It creates a dramatic, smoky effect and doubles as the perfect black eyeliner. Just use a tiny liner brush, and you'll see magic happen.  2000 embodies the early millennium vibe with its supermodel bronzy brown shade. While it doesn\u2019t particularly excite me, it's still a highly wearable and versatile color."

I am not a professional by any means, but love exploring different styles and trends and creating simple, yet eye-catching looks. This palette, MAKE ME LIKE YOU, is perfect for creating everyday looks, or going for a night out on the town.  It has two shimmer shades, Love Sick & Found You, and these 2 shades are the reason I am giving it 4 stars. They are gorgeous shades, but they are way too identical in color once you see them in person. They both look like they are rose gold shades, rather than one of them being a peach shade. The stock pictures make them look like two totally different colors, and are the entire reason I wanted to try this palette. I was a little disappointed in that part, but that's the only negative thing I'd say about this. It does stay on all day long & does not crease, which is all I've been looking for in a good eye palette. The packaging is so chic, but also fits the Gwen Stefani brand perfectly. All in all, if they would revamp this palette and actually make the 2 shimmer colors look like they do in the stock pictures, I would give it 10 stars. But I would still recommend it because it does everything you would want in a good eyeshadow."

The color selection is beautiful, offering a mix of neutral and bold shades that are perfect for everyday wear or a pop of glam. The packaging is sleek and travel-friendly, which is a nice touch. However, the formula could be better. Some of the shades, especially the mattes, are a bit chalky and require extra effort to blend smoothly. The pigmentation varies, with some shades delivering vibrant color payoff while others need a few layers to show up. It\u2019s a decent palette for Gwen Stefani fans or those looking for a versatile, on-the-go option, but it may not fully satisfy those who prioritize consistently high-quality pigmentation and blendability.

            "review_text": "Extremely powdery with lots of kickback from the mattes and fallout from the glitters (and they are absolutely glitters, not shimmers). If you've ever used Tarte's eyeshadow, it's a similar level of powder kickback. Literally one swatch per pan and the black plastic of the palette was already pretty covered in eyeshadow powder.  The color story is pretty good and offers some nice options for different eye looks, although I would have liked to have a lighter, more neutral brown instead of the medium red as a large pan, like a more tan version of the pale pink to use as an alternative base color. Or even a lighter shimmer or sparkly to use as an inner corner highlight. I wouldn't say it's incomplete, but I think a slight tweak like that would make it a little better for getting more variety in looks. The lightest shade (top left pan) is a great base color for me, and both browns work well for crease or corner application, in terms of depth. The glitters have very little base color on their own, and have a lot of fallout. They honestly look better in person than in pictures because they are very sparkly and eye-catching, but it's hard to capture without movement.   The performance isn't terrible but isn't great. Primer makes a huge difference, and glitter glue even more so for the glitters. I've never considered myself to have particularly dry eyelids, but trying to apply these without primer they somehow found dry patches to cling to. They definitely need prep work to look their best. I tried a couple quick looks with no primer (sorry for no eyeliner and lashes to finish!) and thought they blended pretty well though, just had lots of fallout and were a bit more muted. Probably not a good pick for someone who likes to be one (or two) shades and done. I even tried the large pans as blushes just to see, but I wouldn't recommend it. They both pulled much more orange-y and kind of dusty looking over a large area like that.  The packaging is cheap looking and hard to open."

It seemed to last all day without much fading. I used it with and without an eyeshadow primer, and I would have to say I think it looked better and lasted longer with the primer.

Let\u2019s begin with the mattes; they are neutral, soft and buttery with a little kickback (a little is good; it means you and your brushes aren\u2019t going to fight with hard pan - a, well, hard film over the powder that makes it difficult to pick up product. Too much kickback is not good, as it\u2019s more likely the product, whether powder eyeshadow, blush, bronzer, etc., will crumble). The mattes applied nicely with and without primer.   I found the liner shadows difficult to use without wetting my brush first. I used several different brushes to be certain and had the same result each time. The brushes weren\u2019t able to pick up enough product to give more than a shadow otherwise, and I don\u2019t have time to build up liner. There are far easier products and applications otherwise.  The foiled lid toppers were picked up nicely on a dry brush. They look as though they would be more foiled, but that isn\u2019t the case and it\u2019s fine.  The packaging is plastic and sturdy enough. One thing I was thrilled to find is it doesn\u2019t contain any of those useless little brushes that even luxury brands still insist on including for some reason. They waste space, plastic, and end up in the bin the moment I see them. GXVE is wise enough to understand this. It may seem like a small thing, but you don\u2019t have to test makeup and have hundreds of palettes to find it wasteful and irritating.  Personally, these shades, though neutral, did not work for me. I have light-medium skin tone with pink undertone. She shades made the rest of my face look sallow. I do plan to test the other Eye See In Color palette, though. I believe I\u2019ll have better results.              kickback (a little"

All the colors are very neutral and brown except the black one which I use it as an eyeliner. The light matte colors are great for base and have a nice coverage and the deeper matte color is used to create the depth and sculpture of eyes. The glittering colors are very fine and once applied they don\u2019t smudge or transfer. All the colors are very pigmented and if you want a natural look like me you only need one or two applications. It doesn\u2019t come with any applicators but the size of the mirror is very decent."

When I opened it I was impressed with the array of gorgeous colors. Very easy to mix and match depending on mood and outfit. People with fair/light skin will benefit the most out of it, but it will work for almost anyone if you like the color scheme. With it being such natural colors, I would not say it is very buildable because you cannot quite get the level of contrast many people like. Not extremely pigmented and I feel like the mattes can be patchy but the looks still turn out fine when I put a shimmer on top.    I have tried to play with it several ways, but all the shades looked very similar on my skin and I haven\u2019t achieved a full look I was hoping for. Eventually I figured out the best way for me to use it is as a base eye shade and to use it with other palettes to get a finished look. Also, the best way to use the shimmer shades is to push it with a finger into your skin for it to stay. The formula is a bit dry and powdery, so expect some fallout. I use an eye primer first and it increases staying power.    It is an average product and I would suggest it.  * This review was collected as part of a promotion"

The best part that I personally like about the palette is that it has a black shade. With black being it in it gives me the perfect eyeliner look on the go without any touchup needed plus can create smokey eye from the same palette which is a win win for me.

However, I did use it to mix with some of the browns to get a lighter transition shade and that worked quite nicely. The mattes are very pigmented and blendable. They are a bit powdery but not too bad. I hardly ever use black eyeshadow but I created a shadow liner with it and it applied so easily and was pigmented but soft. I almost never do an all matte look but I tried it with this palette and it looked so pretty. The shimmers are a bit chunky which looks very pretty on the eye but when applied with a brush, I do get a good amount of fallout. You definitely get more intensity and less fall out with a finger application. I hope that they release more shades because I was very impressed with this and I want to pick up the other color way!"

The matte eyeshadows are a bit powdery in the pan but blend well on the eye (both with primer and without). The shimmers are nice but since the pan is so small it is tricky to use your finger to apply them. My finger doesn\u2019t t fit completely and these have horrible application if you use a brush. That\u2019s my biggest struggle with the palette - the shimmers need to be applied with a finger but the pan size makes that difficult. The looks I made lasted about 6 - 8 hours without eyeshadow primer and all day with. Overall I like the size and idea, the layout and quality of the shimmers could be improved.

But I was pleasantly surprised how the cool-toned GXVE Eye See in Color Eyeshadow Palette in Simple Kind of Life accentuated my brown eyes naturally and beautifully. These cool-toned eye shadow colors, 4 mattes and 2 shimmers, work for both day and evening looks. My favorite way to apply these buttery smooth shadows is with a brush, which blends effortlessly onto my lids with minimal fallout. I didn\u2019t notice any creasing at the end of the day and the colors looked as vibrant when I first put them on. My favorite eye look is applying the lightest tan matte all over my lid area, the lighter brown matte on the crease, and the darker brown matte to deepen the outer crease and line the lash line. For an evening, smoky look, I like to pack one of the gorgeous shimmer shades on to my inner lids, then line and smoke out my upper & lower lash lines with the jet black matte shade. I love how versatile, compact and sturdy the packaging is too which makes it great for travel.  As a beauty enthusiast, I highly recommend this cool-toned GXVE eyeshadow palette in Simple Kind of Life to anyone who who wants to create a multitude of eye looks, from nude to smoky, with pigmented, blendable, high quality matte and shimmer shadows. *This review was collected as part of a promotion"

Small but not too small so it\u2019s the perfect size for on the go, in your pocket or purse. This is a clean product so no talc! Great neutral colors for an everyday look, work, or fall colors. Personally, I don\u2019t like black in a palette but you can use it to smoke out your lids or as eyeliner. There are 2 sparkly shades too if you want to pump up your look and dazzle for a night look. The shades blend easily using a brush. The color pigmentation is good and stays on my lids even without eyeshadow primer. No fragrance. I recommend this as an everyday palette.

This eyeshadow palette in the shade Simple Kind of Life offers a lovely mix of neutral, earthy tones that are perfect for creating both smoky eye looks and subtle evening glam. The palette design encompasses all shades needed to create a complete eye look - four matte and two shimmer shades.   While I love a smoky eye and palette, I did find myself wanting more light neutral shades as opposed to the standard dark browns and blacks. The shimmer shades are definitely more unique and fun to experiment with. I personally though had trouble creating a casual everyday look with this palette. Other than that, the quality is exceptional. Each shade has incredible pigmentation, is creamy smooth, and blends well. Also the packaging is next level chic! I recommend this product for anyone looking for a go-to all-in-one smoky eye set."

            "review_text": "As a 56-year-old who loves experimenting with eye makeup, I\u2019ve tried many eyeshadow palettes. Still, the GXVE 'Eye See In Color' multi-dimensional eyeshadow palette in \u201cMake Me Like You\u201d truly stands out. This palette has become a go-to in my collection for its exceptional versatility and quality. With six beautifully curated shades, it offers a perfect blend of matte and shimmer finishes, making it easy to switch up my look from day to night or from subtle to bold.  What I really appreciate about this palette is the pigmentation. The colors are vibrant, giving full coverage with minimal product. The buttery texture of the shadows ensures they blend effortlessly, allowing me to easily create professional-looking results. Even after years of experimenting with different products, I\u2019m impressed by how these shadows layer and blend to add depth and dimension without any fallout. It\u2019s ideal whether you\u2019re just starting with makeup or have been playing with it for decades like I have.  Another highlight is longevity. Even without an eyeshadow primer, these shades stay vibrant and crease-free for hours, making them perfect for long days or nights. I love that I don\u2019t need to worry about touch-ups, even when I\u2019m out and about.  The palette itself is sleek and compact, which is great for travel or for keeping in my purse for quick touch-ups. Despite its portable size, there\u2019s a generous amount of product, so it\u2019s a palette that lasts.  While it\u2019s priced higher than some drugstore options, the investment is worth it. The combination of richly pigmented, long-lasting shades and overall versatility makes this palette a must-have for anyone who enjoys playing with different looks. If you\u2019re looking for a high-quality, multifunctional eyeshadow palette, the GXVE 'Eye See In Color' in \u201cMake Me Like You\u201d is an excellent choice, especially if, like me, you love experimenting with your eye makeup at any age.

The warm tones are so natural, and very forgiving especially for someone who is sorta starting over with makeup (I swear I lost all my makeup skills right after I had a baby and went through postpartum) The colors are very buildable! that being said they are pigmented, but not overly pigmented, which means they can easily be layered and built up on the eye, for an easy natural look, but can definitely go more dramatic the more color you add. The ingredients are clean, which you can tell, because the product has caused no irritation to my eyes, which I appreciate, since it is almost impossible not to get some product in your eye when working on your lower lash line! Overall this is going to become a staple product in my makeup routine! Attached is the picture to show what the colors look like on the skin."

I was hesitant on this particular pallet bc of the dark shades. But I followed the advice of Jessica ( Beauty Expert) and used just one eyeshadow brush. I was amazed at how effortless the application was, and  my hazel/green eyes really brightened up. I have oily eyelids, so I applied a primer and used concealer on them and used my Beauty Blender sponge to apply a small amount of setting powder and applied the shadows. It worked and NO fallout. It's perfect for me!"

I depotted this quad to keep the 2 mattes but also to reuse the case by adding a sheet magnet - interestingly, when I pulled up the black plastic the shadows sit in, there was a GXVE on the bottom inside of the case...nothing you could see unless you were cannibalizing the palette... I am sure it's an old design detail that was left in, but I couldn't help but laugh and find it ironic."

This on the level of the children\u2019s play make up that my partner\u2019s kids used to put on me. With so much high quality make up out there, this not worth the buy even though the colors and packaging are amazing. Very disappointing.

My lids are pigmented so I need shadows that balance that out (primer just adds another layer that can   crease by the end of the day).  This palette is FANTASTIC.  Its not going to pop but it will definitely give you a classic, understated, long wearing option.  Its just enough without being too much or too obvious."

I just want to let everyone know that I was excited about this palette, and typically I do not care about fallout. But this palette had fallout on another level. I could have dealt with that, if the quality was good, but when I tell you that I would actually rather go to the drug store and use covergirl or revlon, I am not lying. This palette doesn\u2019t blend, very patchy, every single shade was like this. It all looked like 1 color rather than 4, because the colors literally blend away. Reminded me of subculture, except without hardly any pigment lol. You can\u2019t pack on the color either, because if you do then it\u2019s patchy and chalky. I am skilled at eyeshadow looks, but there was nothing to really do that could save my look both times I tried it. I wiped it off and started all over with a different palette. Not to mention, this palette is so so expensive. I am sad about this not working out, and I want to save anyone I can from buying this quad.  I really do prefer covergirl shadows over this, and I only have/buy luxury eyeshadows. I say this to express how chalky and unblebdable this quad was. And I\u2019m very pale by the way. I can\u2019t imagine this working at all for someone who is darker than me. Save yourselves and pass it. I rarely write reviews. But the people have to know about this one lol."

Note that this rating is only for the eyeshadow quad in Simple Kind of Life, which unfortunately, was too light for me. In the photos, I\u2019m wearing 3 of the 4 shades (all except the light pink shade), but I don\u2019t think you\u2019d be able to tell. For example, I tried to add some depth to the other two shades I already had on by applying the shade \u201cObsessed\u201d to the outer corners of my eyes (see photo 1), but the output looks more like a single wash of colour (see photo 2). Photos taken with different DSLR settings. I\u2019m a bit befuddled how to use this quad on its own. It looks more like a quad that needs to be paired with other shadows to really make it work. To be honest, I have no idea what to do with the two shades on the left half of the palette. The taupe shade didn\u2019t do much for me in terms of colour payoff and the light pink is even worse\u2026 I really wish the light pink was a shimmer instead of a matte so it could be used as a highlight in the inner corners and brow bone. I think that would\u2019ve redeemed this palette so you could at least get a more cohesive look. All the other quad versions have at least one shimmer. Anyway, the one shade I did appreciate was the top right shade, \u201cI Was in Love,\u201d which is a beautiful transition shade that reminds me of my beloved shade Buck from the UD Naked palette. If I were to reach for this palette, it would mainly be for this transition shade."

I\u2019m very pale and this should\u2019ve shown up on me but instead it was barely there.   The 4 shades all blended into each other leaving no definition except a faint peachy tone for the upper right crease shade.   Upper left- transparent pale flesh tone. Really transparent!   Upper right is a soft terra cotta shade that leaves a pale peach tone. Best shade in the quad- it showed up and didn\u2019t totally blend away.   Bottom 2 are both a greenish khaki grey. So near each other that they are essentially the same shade. They make the entire look into a greyish blotch on the eye and blend into each other immediately.   I used my best bulletproof eye primer that always works well (Milani) and it was awful. I\u2019ve had better quality at the drugstore.   I don\u2019t try to rescue bad products- they go back. Things I keep have to perform without a struggle. I don\u2019t exist to make my makeup work, my makeup needs to work every time I pull it out. This just isn\u2019t up to my standards.

The formula is a bit dry and powdery, but I found that it worked just fine as an all over base shade. I wouldn't use this palette for a complete look, but I think it's useful to have on hand for a nice foundation/base eye shade.

I'm not a Gwen super fan (but obv love her, she rocks)--I was interested in talc-free Clean at Sephora eyeshadows. I didn't know what to make of it, but decided to pull the trigger during the sale. For context, I have light colored skin and brown hair, and this palette is the perfect shade match for me. I'm a one and done eye gal, definitely not a Patrick Ta full palette kind of person at all. The pink is a perfect lid shade, the toasty nude color could honestly work as a lovely face contour shade, the lighter brown is a dupe for Jane Iredale's cult Cappuccino shade (which looks gorgeous as a wash on the lid), and the deeper brown shade is certainly not green or khaki as reviewers state and works beautifully as a brow powder with an angled brush! The formula is creamy thanks to the squalane, and since I'm well versed in talc-free eyeshadows I can say the kickback is minimal and not an issue for me. In fact, I swatched this on my arm next to some Mob Beauty eyeshadows in similar shades, and the GXVE is not actually matte--there's very fine mica shimmer. It's gorgeous. My one ding would be the packaging--feels cheap and mine rattles as if it's about the fall apart any minute. I won't dare travel with this lest it cracks open."

I was able to swatch these in store, and to me this color story was the most unique to my collection and seemed to go best with her signature red lipstick that I also picked up.   The packaging is nice, if a little hollow feeling. Both the lipstick tube and compact are made of lightweight plastic, but the construction seems sturdy and the mirror is quite nice. This quad is a great size for traveling and fits nicely in a small purse or clutch. The shadows themselves are a bit dry, but they didn\u2019t produce too much kickback using a flat shader and a Mac blending brush. I also tried using my fingers, application was smooth either way. I\u2019d still recommend using a brush with this, though. . I was able to produce a really simple and flattering look with it without very much effort. I thought the shadows were smooth and easy to blend. They didn\u2019t get muddy or stress my skin out like some matte eyeshadows.    The shades pictured look darker on the website and in promo shots and although the darkest shade has some loose sparkle present in the pan, it falls squarely into the matte category for me. The darkest shade reads as a neutral toned very dark gray, the two brown shades vary more in depth on skin than they appear to in the pan, and the ivory shade is quite pigmented, reading brighter than anticipated on my skin.   We will see how this holds up, but overall I\u2019m pretty impressed! I worked over the Sigma eye primer in ignite, seen here worn with Charlotte Tilbury Hot Lips 2 in Amazing Amal\u2014can\u2019t wait to try a smoky eye with a red lip."

Covered in Shells gave my skin an unflattering \u2018muddy\u2019 look, while Obsessed worked somewhat in my crease to provide minor definition.  As an accompaniment to a bold red lip, a simplified eye frames the look. However, this acts more like a foundational base that necessitates additional dimension.

At first swatch I was a little hesitant with wanting to use the palette because two of the bottom shades were very cool tone grayish (Covered in Shells and Obsessed).  It seemed too light for my MAC NC25 skin tone.  As soon as I dipped my brush into the pan and put it on my lids it felt chalky and didn\u2019t have enough pigmentation.  When applied, the top two shadows barely showed up on my lids.  I used the very light shade (Faithful to Freedom) on the upper left as the all over lid color and the next darker shade on the upper right (I was In Love) as the buffing/contour color.    I didn\u2019t want to even try the two bottom shades in fear that it would make my lids look muddy.  I think this palette may work better for fair skin tones only.  On the bright side, the packaging is chic and cool.  I love the design but think maybe one of her other palettes would have been better suited for me."

When I saw the palette, I thought that is was way too light for my skin tone and it is, but I was able to make it work. I am sure that the other quads are better (more of my liking) and I would have rated them better. PROS: - It is a clean at Sephora brand, cruelty free, vegan, gluten free and with recyclable packaging. - I love that all the products come in clean, modern, chic looking recycled cardboard boxes that have a gorgeous design inside. - The palette box is Mae of plastic and has a matching cardboard background with white and gold letters. I find it so beautiful! It doesn\u2019t feel too heavy so it is great to take on trips. - It doesn\u2019t have any scent. - It comes with a mirror which is always a plus. - It looks like the the four eyeshadow pan can be removed from the package. I don\u2019t know if it is just the way it is or if they will be offering refills. CONS: - The shadows are defined by the brand as buttery but they are the opposite (at least Simple Kind of Life) It is very powdery, with lots of kickback. I am used to ABH shadows so this is not a problem for me. - Also, the brand defines the shadows as highly pigmented and they are not. I needed to pack and pack and pack product in order to get some payoff and ended up looking muddy because of that. - Two of the shadows look almost the same once blended into the skin. This palette doesn\u2019t allow for many looks because of the similarity of the shades and the lack of depth.  - I am missing a deeper shadow and a shimmery shadow to consider this palette a winner, but I can understand that it is just because of my taste and this one fits perfectly lighter skin tones and soft makeup lovers. - I find it expensive for the quality of the shadows."

I got the one with a pink shimmer (app won\u2019t select this one in color selection for review) and it is definitely warmer in person. I have seen the others in person and the colors in the pictures are definitely different.  2. This is hard to open. Not being picky, but I haven\u2019t noticed this with most of my palettes and I did with this one, so worth mentioning.  3. Now for what matters, the formula. This is AMAZING. The mattes blend like a dream and work well together. The shimmers work best with a finger or wet brush and look so good on the eyes. The lightest shade literally makes it look like my lid is glowing.   I recommend this and I will definitely buy another!! I also bought this myself if that helps!"

It is a neutral-cool light color palette of taupes and a light terracotta that pairs very well with the strong lip color in the collection.   It gives a sculpted look that is quite natural looking and would be appropriate for work, and casual daily wear.   The colors give a perfect subtle backdrop to black liquid liner and false lashes (how I like to wear it).  That look is identical to Gwen on the website.     This shadow palette won't steal the show from a dramatic lip, which can be a good thing.    I found the shadows a bit powdery- you have to apply carefully or use your fingers- but it was not the worst I'd seen (hello ABH).   The color payoff was decent.  You have to remember these are lighter colors and will not give a dramatic look- no matter how much you apply.   I found they were velvety and blended quite well on the eye.  The shadows wore extremely well over primer.   They even survived a two-hour workout.     The packaging could stand improvement- the case is plastic-y and hard to open- and is more in line with drug store quality.   Do I think it is a must-have?  No.  I think most of us have similar shadows in our stash already.   But I am pleased enough with how the palette looks with Gwen's new lipcolor (which is fantastic) to keep it."

It reminds me of morphe consistency without the color party off. You can create a nice look, but you will see the result better with eyeliner and mascara.  Maybe the other palettes will show up better? Not what I was expecting."

It's a great day to night palette.  It does have some kick up in the pan but its not falling all over my face.  The only shade I had any fallout with was secrets and it was just the glitter.  That shade is a matte with some gold glitter and any shadow I've ever used that is a matte with glitter the glitter falls out when you blend it. This palette builds and blends easily without being patchy. I recently bought the Charlotte Tilbury super nudes palette and I'm honestly liking this one more.  The CT black shade is just not pigmented enough and comes out patchy.  For $28 this is a nice palette and I'm so glad she kept it reasonable. She easily could have charged twice as much. I'm excited to see more from her!"

I dont always need a palette where there's 10 different shades from one scale to the next; this is actually very refreshing to my collection.  It is powdery but not in an extreme way, I think a lighter touch is helpful and the formula blends really beautifully. My only real complaint is the packaging though cool is on the cheap side, but, thats a nit pick. It's not revolutionary but not everything has to be."
