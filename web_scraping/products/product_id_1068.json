			"review_text": "I bought this during a sale and set it to in-store pickup while on vacation. I figured it'd help cut down my routine. I was right and love it so much. I use the whole set in my regular hair routine even at home: a clip for holding my hair out of the way, the brush for smoothing out that section of hair, and the heat brush for styling my hair. It works wonders on my shoulder-length hair! I do use a heat protectant on each section beforehand, and it helps smooth and shine my hair. I've never been good at using a round brush to style while blow drying. Now I can dry my hair without worrying about how it looks. This will do the work for me afterward - particularly at the back of my head. I highly recommend! (It's also great if you shower at night and need a quick refresh in the morning before heading out.)"

Use heat protectant spray too, it can get hot, especially if you have finer hair. Overall though, it's a fun and easy to use product with great results."

It gives my hair so much body and bounce. You can straighten and curl your hair with it too. It perfectly styles my butterfly layers and curtain bangs. I also love that the hot round brush has an extra long cord and has a chime sound that lets you know it‚Äôs turned on or off and another when it has heated up.

I love the multifunctionality of the kit because my hair is wavy and I always have a lot of frizz, but by using this brush, I saved time by avoiding flat irons and, at the same time, reduced damage to my hair. After using it, my hair had much more movement, softness, volume, and even more shine. In addition to the brush, it comes with all the necessary tools to make the styling process faster and more convenient. I definitely recommend it."

I love that this hot brush is super light, which really matters to me because I have dry, wavy hair that‚Äôs usually hard to style. The set temperature makes it easy to add volume at the roots, style my bangs, and create loose waves without any fuss. The long swivel cord is also great because it doesn‚Äôt get tangled up while I‚Äôm using it, making the whole process so much easier. On top of that, this set is beautifully designed and would make a perfect gift for anyone who loves hair styling tools."

The clips that came with it was helpful to section the parts I am styling. I used the mini paddle brush to detangle and smooth out any knots before I used the thermal round brush.
