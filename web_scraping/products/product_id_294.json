The sprayer is a nice fine mist but I'll probably end up spraying it into my hands and dispersing it into my hair instead. Price is really good too compared to other products like this."

It deranges my hair very well and gives provides very light moisture and a healthy non-weighed down shiny finish. I have very oily hair and I have thick porous and wirey strands but not a lot of hair… and I can’t use very heavy moisturizing products because my hair not only gets oily even faster but also clumps and flattens so I often struggle finding light-moisture products. This product keeps my hair clean, smooth, and not oily. If you are looking for deep moisture and extreme smoothing, this is not it so I suggest combining it with other hair products because this is very light. The continuous spray bottle is a little hard to get used to but I just lightly press the spray trigger and I can better control the amount, it’s kind of hard to go overboard with this product.

It leaves my hair feeling silky-smooth and helps it to retain moisture while also taming some of my frizz and reducing breaking. It also leaves my hair more manageable, shiny, and volumized while helping to promote healthy hair growth. It works super well as a heat/uv protectant and comes in a really cool bottle that features a lock button on the cap, which I love because I have young kids.

It is very easy to use. There is no particular smell for this product. I apply it usually on my damp hair after washing it and let it dry out naturally.

I noticed a significant reduction in breakage and frizz once I started using it. My hair feels stronger and smoother than ever before. It remains lightweight after application and doesn't feel sticky, waxy, or bogged down by the product. Plus, it provides essential heat protection for my daily use of a hair straightener or flat iron. The hydrating formula moisturizes deeply, making my hair look healthier too. Once I spray it on my damp hair, I achieve a luxurious salon-style look that's incredibly glossy. I'm thrilled to have discovered this mist; it's doing wonders for my frizz control."

It helps detangle my hair and worked great as a heat protectant before styling. Another thing to note is how cool the spray nozzle is! It gives a continuous spray making it easy to do one spray over a large amount of hair and making sure it’s evenly distributed. Actually the continuous mist was very innovative and I’ve never seen another product like this. The bottle also has a convenient lock which makes it great for travel because it won’t accidentally spray in your bag. First time trying this brand and I’m a fan!

First in foremost the first thing I realized about this product is that it smells amazing, I would love a perfume made with this scent. Second, the component has a great mist dispenser, disperses the product evenly making it feel super light. My hair looked shiny but not greasy with less frizz. I’m extremely happy to include it in my hair routine for my straight hair and my daughter’s curly hair."

It has a nice light pleasant scent that is not too overpowering. I love how this leave-in conditioner keeps my frizzy hair under control and that it strengthens my hair. My hair looks healthy and feels soft and smooth with a beautiful shine. It feels hydrated and looks revitalized after each use. The perfect leave-in conditioner to add to my daily haircare routine!"

The first time i used this, i was expecting the same results.  As a mist- its a little on the lighter side. (As a Leave in conditioner should be). In the first use I couldn’t feel quite the moisturizing factor and really overdid it with the spray.  I am finding my perfect balance now. I still recommend if you have course/dry hair- to condition well. I use a moisturizing cream first, and then I used the money mist as the finishing touch.   After that- my blow out had the same extra shine and smooth effect i would get from the masque.   I absolutely love the fragrance and believe this could be more used more regularly, as opposed to the mask that I would probably do every couple of washes.  Great product overall if you know your hair needs!"

My hair feels soft and well conditioned after use and I air dry my hair and it works well for that. The smell is very good as well but not overwhelmingly strong.

The product itself has a lightweight feel that’s a dream to apply. It doesn't weigh down my hair or leave any greasy residue; instead, it vanishes into my strands, providing hydration without the heaviness. It’s like my hair drinks it in, leaving it feeling nourished and refreshed. Visually, my hair has never looked better. The frizz that once defined my hair's texture has been tamed, leaving behind sleek, glossy locks that reflect light beautifully.
