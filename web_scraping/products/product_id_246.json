Honestly drug store packaging is better. This is giving home made makeup vibes, like they found a cheap tin that was good enough and decided to try and roll out a brand with it. Product seems ok but if the packaging is this cheap it makes me question the quality of ingredients."

I always have a hard time with bronzer, as most of them give me skin rash but not this one. However, the packaging NEEDS some work and the powder in general is quite fragile. I dropped mine from less than 20cm and broke some of the blush. The packaging didnt help protect it at all.  But overall it is a good product."

The bronzer is also really nice and easy to build or keep more subtle. Love that it doesn’t pull super orange too.   I actually adore the tin—it’s something I would reuse and is super cute + lightweight. The palette has some movement but mine is still “stuck” at the sides so it isn’t really clanking around so much as kind of floats between the bottom and top of the pan, which I think is actually keeping my clumsy self from breaking it already.  Extra bonus supporting Canadian Indigenous-owned brands too.  10/10"

			"review_text": "The blush and bronzer are gorgeous, they blend beautifully on the skin! I just wish the packaging was different. The packaging has a lot of space between the product and the lid, so when the glue holding the product down wore off (which was very quickly just within a month or so), the product had a lot of space to bounce around. Because the product is very delicate, even putting it in a makeup bag for travel and having it shuffle around a bit would cause it break and crumble. I've only had this product for a few months but I've lost a good half of it now just because the product broke. I'd repurchase this if the packaging changes."

The blush color reminds me of the forever sold out Dior blush. The combined products are so convenient for travel, or having with you in your purse. I also love the use of the tin. Would recommend this to anyone."

It's pigmented yet buildable, and somehow the bright pink in the tin translated to a soft natural flush when applied. Magic! I do have a medium tan with yellow undertones so it balanced out nicely to give a fresh natural finish. Also glad to see Sephora supporting Canadian Indigenous-owned brands!"

Particularly in love  with the blush- I haven’t been able to put it down and I even took it with me on vacation as soon as I received. The bronzer is nice too, it’s a good contour on my skin tone (NC44), but I don’t wear the bronzer alone as it’s not warm enough as a stand-alone bronzer. The only con is that the tin packaging doesn’t hold the powder firmly and it shakes around and I really don’t want it to break! Very happy to support a Indigenous, female-owned brand at Sephora!"

I may have been blessed by the makeup gods, but I've dropped that product a couple of times and so far it hasn't broken yet! It's a staple in my beauty routine for sure now."
