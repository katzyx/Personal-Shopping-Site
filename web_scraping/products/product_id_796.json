			"review_text": "The most moisturizing product I’ve ever used,it gives my skin an instant glow. Paired well with the Vanilla Vibezzz Scrub. Unlike most body butters containing Argan Oil,this one isn’t sticky and doesn’t feel greasy. My skin drinks up this butter. A little goes a long way,it holds whatever fragrance I spray on top of it. My sensitive skin responds well to it"

This one is less than half full after having it a couple weeks. I've used them both sparingly as I don't get paid again in a while. I don't know if this jar was a returned item that someone previously used. I'm really upset as this is not a inexpensive product. I don't know if you can tell in the photo this brand has a lot more missing."
