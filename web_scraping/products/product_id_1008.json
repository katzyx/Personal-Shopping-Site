This is NOT a swipe from the tube and blend blush (at least not if you're the shade of paper, like me). I dab a brush ever so slightly on the product and it blends out beautifully. I would imagine these could work on any skin tone since they are incredibly pigmented. I now have the blushes and bronzer stick (the foundation stick was a bit of a fail for me)...I plan on trying more products from LYS. Great brand!"

Out of all the cream blushes I’ve experimented with, LYS takes the cake for being the most pigmented.  You can swipe these sticks straight on to your cheeks for a bold look or use a brush to pick up color from the blush stick before applying it to your cheeks for a more subdued look.  You can easily twist up the stick to access more product and twist it down to secure it inside the cap so no blush accidentally gets scraped off the side.  The blush is velvety smooth and doesn’t dry down quickly so you have time to blend.  The finish of the blush gives a dewy, hydrated effect to the face.  There is no visible glitter or shimmer.  On my fair skin, shade Focused is a brick red."

With a formula consisting a subtle sparkle it transforms into a dewy finish on the cheeks providing a luminous effect. The pigment is HERE! Be aware that a little goes a long way. It’s easy in applications so you can use your fingers, a sponge or a brush. I prefer a brush because that’s how I use my bronzer."
