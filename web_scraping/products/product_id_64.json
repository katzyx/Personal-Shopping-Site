			"review_text": "Purchased this set with a Christmas gift card during Boxing Week sales. WOW!!! I‚Äôm obsessed üòç I never tried Armani lip prism lipgloss but I was attracted by all the 5 star reviews and promise of buttery soft lips. So happy I bought this for myself! My lips have been so dry lately since the winter has settled in, and so many of the new lip balms and glosses I‚Äôve tried just aren‚Äôt doing much for the health and healing of my chapped, peeling lips apart from my standard faves. These are now among my faves ever! So wonderful for a touch of lovely colour and so nourishing. I will definitely include more shades from this lineup in the future because there‚Äôs no discernible scent, it‚Äôs not sticky as many glosses are, it doesn‚Äôt dry out my lips over hours and leaves them softer and prettier, and the packaging is really luxurious. Highly recommend‚Äîa steal for this set!"
