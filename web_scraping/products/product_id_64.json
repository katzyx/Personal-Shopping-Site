Iu2019m obsessed ud83dude0d I never tried Armani lip prism lipgloss but I was attracted by all the 5 star reviews and promise of buttery soft lips. So happy I bought this for myself! My lips have been so dry lately since the winter has settled in, and so many of the new lip balms and glosses Iu2019ve tried just arenu2019t doing much for the health and healing of my chapped, peeling lips apart from my standard faves. These are now among my faves ever! So wonderful for a touch of lovely colour and so nourishing. I will definitely include more shades from this lineup in the future because thereu2019s no discernible scent, itu2019s not sticky as many glosses are, it doesnu2019t dry out my lips over hours and leaves them softer and prettier, and the packaging is really luxurious. Highly recommendu2014a steal for this set!"
