			"review_text": "I adore this product. I have fine, short hair that almost refuses to grow and shows breakage after I curl my hair once. This product is very hydrating, but doesn't weigh my hair down. If you're looking for a product to bring your curls and natural shine back to your hair, this product is for you. If you're looking for a product that will do similar things but bring more volume to your hair, I would gear more towards the normcore line."

			"review_text": "While I love this shampoo and conditioner and wanted to try the overnight mask out, when I first ordered this set the mask that is in a glass container arrived shattered and with product and glass shards spilled in the whole box. When customer service sent me another one of these sets the same thing happened again where the overnight mask arrived shattered and with product spilled everywhere, unsalvagable. Not putting any protective packing materials inside of the cardboard box that the products are packaged in and letting a glass hair product have plenty of room to move around while being shipped across the country is quite shocking considering the cost of these products and the fact that this is an online only purchase. While I would recommend purchasing these products individually, do not buy this online-only set because you may receive a damaged hair mask."

			"review_text": "omg y'all, i just tried this new 3-piece hair set and it's like a total game changer. so first up, the hydro rush shampoo and conditioner are literally everything. my hair was sooo thirsty and this stuff just brought it back to life. like, no more dry, crunchy ends‚Äîjust smooth, hydrated strands. but wait, it gets better. the dream routine overnight hydration treatment is the real star. i used it before bed and woke up with hair that felt 3x more hydrated. like, how is that even possible? i also tried putting it in before a braid and it gave me this sleek look that still had all the benefits of the overnight treatment. so versatile! also, the key ingredients are top-notch. hyaluronic acid, squalane, and bio-fermented coconut water? YES PLEASE. these are like the holy grail of hydration. so if you're looking to pamper yourself or need a perfect gift for your bestie who loves a bit of self-care, this set is a total win. trust me, you won‚Äôt regret it. gifted by amika"
