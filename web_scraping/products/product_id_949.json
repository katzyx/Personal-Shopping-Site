The hydration felt lasting throughout the day, which is a huge plus, especially in this dry climate.  The packaging is sleek and modern, making it a lovely addition to my vanity. Each product has a lightweight texture that glides on effortlessly, and the subtle, fresh scent is soothing without being overpowering. I appreciate how quickly the product absorbs into my skin, leaving no greasy residue‚Äîjust a soft, hydrated finish.  Overall, I find myself reaching for this set regularly, as my skin feels fantastic, and hydration remains intact well into the following day. If you‚Äôre looking for a hydration boost that delivers on its promises, I highly recommend giving the Laneige Water Bank Hyaluronic Hydration Set a try!"

			"review_text": "The Laneige Water Bank Hyaluronic Hydration Set truly lives up to its name. From the first use, I noticed immediate hydration, and my skin felt plump and refreshed. Overnight, it continues to work wonders, leaving my skin deeply hydrated by morning. Water Bank Cream Moisturizer: This cream is the star of the set. Right after the first use, my skin felt deeply hydrated and smoother. Its Blue Hyaluronic Acid, which is 2000x smaller than regular hyaluronic acid, absorbs quickly into the skin, providing lasting hydration that works even overnight. Water Bank Serum: This serum is an excellent hydration booster.  The serum absorbs easily and preps the skin perfectly for the moisturizer that follows. It‚Äôs light and silky, layering well without leaving any greasiness behind. I love that it helps with both hydration and firming, leaving my skin feeling revitalized. Revitalizing Toner: I found the toner to be refreshing and gentle on my skin. It preps the skin for better absorption of the serum and moisturizer. With Blue Hyaluronic Acid, this toner adds an extra layer of moisture without being drying or irritating. Cleansing Foam: The cleansing foam is a great start to the routine, leaving my skin clean but not stripped. It foams up nicely and has a soft, smooth texture that feels gentle on the skin. Perfect for removing  daily impurities, it also helps keep skin hydrated rather than leaving it tight or dry.  The Laneige Water Bank Hyaluronic Hydration Set is perfect for anyone dealing with dryness, and it helps restore that smooth, dewy glow!"

This set is no different and honestly if I could give it 6 stars I would have. First, the cleanser is literally amazing. About a dime amount, on a wet face and it gets foamy fast. Wipes off clean. The toner surprised me. Any toners I‚Äôve ever used were very liquidity/thin. This was not - it was actually kind of thick. But it absorbed immediately like a toner. I don‚Äôt know what magic Laneige is doing over there but whatever, it all works! Then the serum. I did use a full dime size amount of this for my face and neck. And then lastly the cream moisturizer. My face just slurps this stuff up. I love them all and I love using them all together. Laneige knocks it out of the park again and I use many various competitor creams but in my fairly extensive skincare cabinet, Laneige I always wind up going back to often and replenishing when out because I just have to have it. This set and their products are amazing."

The set includes a full size of the Water Bank Blue Hyaluronic Cream Moisturizer for Moisture Barrier Repair along with deluxe mini sizes of the cleanser, serum and toner, so you have the entire routine. It is perfect for gifting and for travel, and is an excellent value too! These products work together to deliver long-lasting hydration to the skin while also supporting skin barrier health. I personally feel like not only does it provide instant hydration for my skin, but my skin has been feeling more hydration in general lately when I've been using this set. The textures are lovely and they all have a subtle fresh scent which is great for those who don't like strong fragrances in their skincare. The serum and moisturizer both absorb into the skin quite quickly and leave my skin feeling hydrated, soft and smooth. Definitely cart worthy and perfect for travel!"

First off, the powerhouse full-size Water Bank Cream Moisturizer - supple, creamy, and hydrated my skin overnight. It‚Äôs thick without feeling greasy and perfect for my combo/leans dry skin. I use it before bed and wake up without irritation or dry skin! Second, the cream cleanser. A little goes a long way, so I use a little less than a pea-sized amount and my face feels soft and clean afterward. I follow with the toner and serum and my face doesn‚Äôt feel stripped or dry afterward. The toner has more of a watery gel consistency than the typical watery consistency of toners which is SO helpful because I can control the amount of product coming out better.
