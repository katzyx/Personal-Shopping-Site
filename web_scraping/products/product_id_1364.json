I took a chance and ordered the Evercalm Overnight Recovery Balm, and within five days, the redness, flakiness, and scaliness were completely gone. Literally saved my skin!   A little goes a long way, so while it may seem a little pricey, it’ll be a long time before you have to reorder. I am still using the pot I purchased back in January. I never leave reviews, but I had to for this product — I recommend it to literally everyone I know. Thank you for saving my skin, REN!"

Out of the other 3 moisturizers I’ve bought so far (all have amazing reviews) this one is the best.  It does have a heavier feeling on the skin but that is why it’s labeled as an overnight cream. I’ve used it every night since purchasing the mini and I’m obsessed! My skin looks amazing the next morning. I was considering buying another more costly moisturizer to try out but now I dont feel the need. I will definitely be purchasing the large size when my mini runs out!"

It takes a pea size and it warms up to an oil texture. Love it: it’s a keeper and a dry and cold weather savior."

After decades of dealing with oily skin and acne, I now have breakouts PLUS sensitive, red, incredibly dry and flaky skin. It's maddening. I know the skin barrier is compromised, but even the most intense moisturizers couldn't seem to combat the flakes. I tried this balm out of sheer desperation. TBH, my first thought when opening this was that it was a small jar for the price! After using it the first night, I was impressed with how soft my skin felt. But when I looked in the mirror, I wondered why I looked so pale. Then I realized that my face wasn't pale, it just wasn't the sensitive shade of red that I was used to. After using it for two weeks, it feels like a miracle occurred. I will definitely be purchasing more REN products, despite the steep price. It's more economical than buying five different products that don't work."

I have somewhat sensitive skin, occasional small patches of eczema in the winter, occasional perioral dermatitis from stress, and very oily T-zone. This balm feels so good to use, it moisturized my skin better than any lotion I have every used, calmed down my perioral dermatitis, and has not increased the oil in my T zone. I still have some redness but this product made a noticeable improvement. Even though I really enjoy it am not sure that I will purchase it at 55$ simply because that is too much for me right now."

			"review_text": "I bought this from Ipsy, because I've had good luck with other REN products. It's so nice on the skin, melts to basically a liquid and soaks in instantly, it's not greasy *at all*, and so light it's practically not there. It feels like nothing when you rub it in. It's great for my rosacea flare ups, but what really stole my heart was it saving my nose.  Last week I came down with some kind of respiratory illness, so I was blowing my nose 20-30 times A DAY. By Friday my nose was dry, flaky, red, cracked, bleeding, and so, so painful. This balm. My god. It's called Overnight Recovery for a reason. *Literally* overnight, one use, my nose was 70% better and not sore any more, and it doesn't leave a disgusting residue like the lotion tissues do. I've been applying the balm a few times a day to protect my nose from the residual nose-blowing, and it's completely recovered, save for a little crack that's not quite 100% healed yet, and blowing my nose doesn't make me want to cry anymore. If nothing else, grab some for the next time you have a head cold. Your nose will thank you. Also makes a spectacular lip treatment if you get severely dry lips like I do. Soaks in completely and in about 30 mins all the flakes are gone and my lips are soft. It's insane. I'm sure you're skeptical and I wouldn't believe it if it didn't happen to me, but this stuff is miracle juice."

My face had got so burnt after a day on the water to where my cheeks and under eyes looked shiny and swollen. I had no aloe Vera products and had let someone else use the rest of my burn gel. I got home, washed my face with a hydrating gentle face wash and slapped a layer of this stuff on. When I woke up, the burn was completely gone! Not even a little pink! Just a beautiful tan! I can already tell that my face will not be peeling. This worked in 1 night, better than anything I've ever used for sunburn that takes days, and still will be dry and peely after."

Many products irritate my skin further, but this recovery balm is soothing and reduces any inflammation within the hour. Even when I'm not exfoliating, I like to use this balm at least three times per week as the last step in my nighttime skincare routine.  The thick, jelly-like consistency is ideal for slugging and creates an occlusive barrier that locks in moisture overnight.  The product stays on my face all night without feeling sticky or greasy, doesn't transfer on to my pillow or sheets, and is still noticeable in the morning.  It has an earthy scent likely from the combination of included oils, but it doesn't linger long after application.  Since I've been using this balm, my skin looks less flaky and feels softer and smoother.  A little goes a long way; I only need a thumb nail size dollop to coat my face.  Be sure to rub the balm between your fingers to soften the texture and make it easier to spread.  Gifted by REN Skincare."

I received the Evercalm Overnight Recovery Balm complimentary from renskincare and I decided to use it after my serums and treatments. I am really digging it! It is so gentle & soothing. It was easy to apply, lightweight & non-greasy. It also gave my skin a nice glow. This is definitely a great standalone product or sealant after using actives. No fragrance and made with clean ingredients so you shouldn't have any reactions. Highly recommend"

I tried it the next night on my face two nights in a row and by the second morning I had noticed a slightly softer and less-dry feel.

Very little product is enough to spread it all over the face, pea size is perfect. it's melted evenly and absorbs quickly into the skin.  It doesn't leave a greasy feeling but it is quite moist so I prefer to use it at night. A single application was enough to realize how miraculous this cream is.  Well lately my skin is more sensitive than usual due to the use of retinol and the constant and erroneous exfoliation that I have been doing. Small but annoying acne breakouts have appeared and only this wonderful product has given me hope of recovering the healthy and lush texture of my skin.

The texture of this balm is thick yet lightweight. It is great for sensitive, very dry or stressed skin and is even safe for eczema prone skin. Evercalm contains many amazing oils like almond, olive, sunflower and jojoba. 💚  I use this on both my face and my youngest sons face at bedtime, he has super sensitive, dry skin, and it helps nourish both his face and mine. Evercalm does not clog our pores. Our dry patches are completely illuminated. This overnight balm is one of my all time favorites for deep overnight, moisturization, hydration, and nourishment. 💚"

I wish Sephora would let you post more than 2 pictures so that folks could see the week to week/month to month progress this balm has done for my face.  I had a nasty and self-esteem killing eczema flare on my face for a year before trying this product. My skin was perpetually dry and nothing was penetrating deep enough to do anything along with addressing how eczema folks have a damaged skin barrier that makes it really hard for our skin to retain moisture. Steroids and even expensive creams than this one were doing NOTHING and I was frequently left in tears and in pain from how dry my face was.  I hated seeing photos of myself so much that when I got proposed to, I didn’t bother taking ring selfies. That’s how much I abhorred my face.  I gave this product a try because someone on R/Eczema recommended it and at first, I was hesitant due to the price but due to desperation, tried it… and I am so glad I did. I’m on my 8th jar at this point, that’s how much I love this balm. I actually put it on several times a day due to how dry my skin is which is also why I’ve used so many balms but if you just have a small dry, stubborn patch, the jar will go a long way. Wasn’t the case for me since I used this for my whole face lol  When you use this product, you can see the difference literally the next day. For me, I saw it within HOURS. I can actually smile and laugh without my face feeling tight and uncomfortable.   If you are on the fence/desperate for something to work especially if you have eczema, I swear on my dog’s life to give this balm a try. If it doesn’t do anything, at least return it when it’s 80% full for a refund 😙  Lastly, I knew this product worked when my fiancé told me how my face feels soft again 🥺  I’ve attached some photos showing the progress - first pic is Oct 15th, 2022 and second pic is Dec 3rd, 2022."

This product has allowed me to use retinol almost daily compared to once a week. I've tried so many different hydrating products and this is the only one that has worked!

It feels very greasy going on but never broke me out and when I woke up the next day my skin and soaked it all in and was soft and hydrated.  I didn’t use this product during the summer as it was too heavy for my combo skin in the heat/ humidity. I pulled it out again in November and noticed my skin was red and splotchy but I assumed that was because it was irritated from my retinol. I used the balm a few more times this month and each time it made my face red and splotchy. It didn’t burn or feel irritated and still left my skin soft but made me red and dried out my skin by the next morning.  I am not sure if this is 100% why this occurred but I believe it was because I had it opened for too long and it should be used quicker than that as the ingredients are very natural. If you don’t plan on using this regularly I recommend getting the mini version (available on REN’s website). If you do plan on using it regularly I highly recommend the full size! It is so calming and hydrating."

Because I've been using Tatcha for three years now. suddenly, my skin cannot handle anything with a fragrance and that caused immediate breakouts, I had no idea what was going on. I've tried all the face oils sold at Sephora, every hydrating mask, whatever, you name it; But nothing was providing the hydration that I needed until I came across this. It feels like a breathable Vaseline slugging mask. I usually apply nothing prior to this mask. I use it twice a week, sometimes more, depending on how my skin reacts after using exfoliating serums and toners. I LOVE this. My skin feels silky, smooth, and hydrated the next morning and it feels plump the next day. I used to struggle with dry under eyes (still kinda do, but it's much, much better), and I had a dry tip nose, AND my nose is also oily-I used to get a lot of blackheads (combo skin) also the area around my lips would be dry as well.

It does what an occlusive like Vaseline would do but it’s actually healthy for your skin on top of it. I took a star off because it’s so pricey.

Thankfully I received a full-sized sample courtesy of BzzAgent, otherwise I'd still be oblivious to this skincare gem. Although I've currently established a skincare routine comprised of numerous products from several Brands, I'm always up to try new products as skincare is always improving as it evolves and Ren Evercalm Overnight Recovery Balm is a prime example of this.   First off, it takes very little product to cover your entire face, neck and decollete as it almost melts between your fingers, meaning less is more and also makes for unbelievable easy applications. It seriously glides seamlessly across your skin as it's immediately absorbed, meaning your treated areas feeling soft, supple and hydrated immediately. What's even sweeter is it does all its work while you're sleeping and you awake to skin that's equally soft, supple and hydrated as well as it looking refreshed, renewed and more youthful the longer that you use it.   I love that this product is full of ingredients that you'd expect and want to find in your skincare products while sans ingredients that you don't want. And while it contains numerous natural oils I've not had any breakouts even though I've got an oily t-zone with a chin that is very acne prone. In addition to maintaining clear, healthy, refreshed skin, I've also noticed that my fine lines appear diminished while my skin looks and feels more firm overall.   I am extremely pleased with my results thus far and I'm only a few weeks into its addition to my nighttime skincare routine. One quick and simple application before bedtime is yielding results fabulous enough that I'm already getting compliments and inquires as to what I'm doing different/using and I love it! REN Clean Skincare Evercalm™ Overnight Recovery Balm definitely gets two very enthusiastic thumbs up from me & is totally a beauty bag MUST-HAVE!!!!! it is the Fountain Of Youth In A Jar!!!!!"

My skin is pretty thirsty 24/7 and with my recent rebrand I’ve been shooting a lot so it’s been nice to see how moisturized my skin feels when I have to wake up and head to a shoot.   Nothing says moisturize your face girl like flaky skin. Fun fact, the ingredients are 100% clean and the cap is recyclable! Def recommend!"

Being winter time my skin gets insanely dry and anything that brushes my arms legs or hands leave a mark. I also have sensitive skin. Using this balm at night makes my skin so much more hydrated and healthier looking. I use it everywhere Id usually apply a moisturizer. This tiny jar will last for so long so the cost pays for itself. Jsut take a fingertip amount and melt it in your hands and rub where needed. It applies like a thinner petroleum jelly and has the same feeling once it dries. Its smells clean and organic. Its vegan/cruelty free also!! Main ingredients are Zinc Oxide, yellow passion fruit seed extract, rice starch. Its even helped my boyfriend with the cracks on his hands! I recommend this to anyone whose skin needs a pick me up and wants to support their skins outter layer."

I like how it makes my skin feel although I can feel a little heavy so a little bit does go along way but I really like the fact that it was made for a sensitive skin and it gives you soft and hydrated skin while still being gentle enough to use on a daily basis if you needed it! I love that I received this product for free to try it was definitely a product that I might not have picked up on my own just due to the fact that I probably felt like my skin didn’t need it due to my skin type but I was definitely wrong and you shouldn’t judge a product by X it’s cover it’s something that I would definitely purchase and I would definitely recommend it to friends and family that are dealing with skin dryness or sensitivity!"

Thos is to a point that on ceryain cold days, you could legit see dry patches of skin. The REN overnight recovery balm is a true elixir in that it has been able to supplement my skin with the right quantity of moisturizer and has done a good job at even retaining it overnight. I don't wake up with those dry patches and strained skin anymore which is an incredible feeling. This balm also fits my clean beauty requirements, so I'm definitely going to be sticking around to this brand. Also, great gifting option to close family and friends that have similar skin concerns."

It gets pretty oily, especially with humidity and heat, but also tends to dry out and peel occasionally in cooler weather when the heating is running indoors. My skin is sensitive and I react pretty strongly to most scented products. The Ren Evercalm balm is definitely more hydrating than regular lotion and hyaluronic acid based moisturizers. I would compare it to using Vaseline on your face. Just a little bit goes a long way. The first night I used it, I used too much and my face was oily and sticky the entire next day. The following times I only used a little dab and melted it on my skin like the instructions stated. Much better results! My skin was still hydrated but not super oily in the following days. The balm is unscented and didn't trigger any allergic reaction. Since a little goes a long way, the amount provided will last a long time. I'm knocking off a star because I think that for combination skin it's just a little bit too hydrating and battling the resulting oiliness the next day isn't fun. If you have super dry and peeling skin, this is probably a lifesaver for you. I seriously wish they made a lip balm with the same properties though..."

I've been using it after applying my serums at night and then adding a face oil on top and my skin looks and feels so soft and supple when I wake up each day. It isn't greasy or sticky at all whatsoever and feels very lightweight once applied. I love the soft texture and how it has a very subtle fragrance.

I did reapply many times and it’s just wonderful! It sinks into your skin & I imagine this is a lifesaver for surviving the winter cold’s effects on your skin. My toddler likes it as well ..

Otherwise, it has some really nice ingredients and it definitely helps to repair the skin barrier when my skin is feeling sensitive or irritated. It is, as I already said, a very heavy product that can be a little too much for my combination skin.

I find it hard to get the perfect amount out of the jar, but scooping a tiny bit out with the top of my fingernail seems to be the best method. I use any leftover product on my cuticles and top of my hands. The balm melts right in without leaving any greasy residue. If you have extremely dry skin, give it a try.

So, as a stand alone product I just find this balm too greasy. I am mostly normal in winter, slightly oily t-zone in the summer. There would be zero way I could get away with this in hot weather. And, oddly I can almost not get a small enough amount to make this balm not make me look like an oil slick.

In the winter, my skin is super dry and this helped moisturize my skin in such a cooling way that wasn’t greasy. The amazing thing about this balm is that it works with my skin to help intensively nourish my skin while I’m sleeping. I woke up feeling and looking like a different person with skin that looks soothed and calm and nourished. I was super impressed ad will absolutely purchase in the future."

My first impression the minute i opened and applied on my face is fragrance, Yes it has a little bit different fragrance that wasnt so impressive but yes the balm has worked so well in my face and had complete hydrated look when i woke up in the morning. Coming to the texture of it its quite thick consistency and i love that. When applied it will leave a little bit of shine on face but gets absorbed into the skin in a couple of minutes. I have been using only at night so that my skin gets recovered from the blue light rays of electronics and pollution. I would recommend it for someone with dry to extremely dry skin and who can welcome a slightly different fragrance of the product."

As I have grown into a beauty enthusiast, I have been experimenting with several skincare products.  I was the person that would do a nighttime routine that simply included 1) washing my face 2) applying an undereye cream 3) apply moisturizer 4) lastly soak it all in with Vaseline.  As time went on, I realized that Vaseline applied all over the face may not be contributing to the overall benefit of my face.  This is the product that I was looking for!  Once I complete my now five-step skincare routine, this REN product is the perfect seal and barrier to my skin and my satin pillowcase. I have noticed a huge difference in my skin’s elasticity, texture, and overall glow in the morning.  Ren Evercalm Balm is a lot better than Aquaphor healing ointment because it is all natural and feels more gentle on my face.  I would highly recommend this balm to anyone with dryness, redness, or overall dullness on their face and want to have a miracle balm that can protect and intensify the internal glow from within.  I also recommend this balm to anyone that wants to put a little pep in their skin."

I only keep my house at 66°F and didn't need to warm the formula between my fingers as directed; there was a pool of liquid sitting on top of the product that I accidentally spilled while opening the product. It might be easier to use straight olive oil. Less greasy. I've only been using the product for a short while so I can't comment on the effectiveness yet. I just want to recommend putting this balm on and putting your hands in gloves to sleep. That way it won't get all over your clothes or bedsheets."

This Ren Clean skincare Evercalm overnight recovery balm is just amazing. It really works so well on my skin. My dry patches are so relieved now and my skin feels so hydrated. My skin feels so so soft when compared to before. The recovery balm has great ingredients like almond oil, jojoba oil, sunflower oil which is so soothing. I am so impressed that it’s made of vegan ingredients without any animal products and another good part is that it comes in recyclable jar and lid.  It is also great on my lips. Prevents lips from drying. Every night I cleanse my face and apply this and massage my face and this routine is helping me a lot to have a moisturized skin and my skin has a natural glow. I am overall very very happy with this recovery balm."

It feels lightweight on your skin; almost like drinking water has no taste, this feels like nothing on your skin. I have combination skin so finding a moisturizer that hydrates but doesn’t make my t-zone shine has been rather difficult. This is perfect for combining with other products overnight because it has no harsh ingredients and doesn’t interact or counteract other products which made it super easy to incorporate into my skincare routine. It says overnight but you can definitely use it during the day for extra hydration wherever you have drier areas. It blends like a dream and a little goes a long way. It has definitely helped to rebuild my skins barrier & doesn’t cause any irritation. This has been so beneficial to my sensitive skin during this cold weather. The packaging is an average sized glass jar & the texture looks a little like Vaseline; but the product itself is very soothing on my skin. Overall a great product I’d recommend and purchase, as this was gifted to me in exchange for my honest opinion."

The ingredient list on this is amazing and it left my skin so replenished, didn't look dull and was so moisturized in the morning. I didn't even feel the need to apply a moisturizer in the morning. So much better than my normal moisturizers. I love that this is cruelty free and doesn't contain any of those concerning ingredients like parabens, mineral oil, silicone, as well as many others. I like that it is a glass jar(instead of plastic). The product itself doesn't have much of a scent and  is almost like solid fat that once you warm up in your hands begins to melt.

It is best to store it at room temperature and should re-firm once it cools down.

My skin type is dry and acne prone, which means I deal with irritation from my acne, the acne treatments often cause dryness, and then I have to treat the dry skin. It's a fun cycle (/s)  As such, I went into this balm knowing that I do appreciate a good, hefty balm for overnight usage. I look for healing ingredients (for the irritation) and a good occlusive to lock in moisture.  As for my usage of this balm, it's thick and occlusive. I disagree with those who say it feels like Vaseline, although I see where they're coming from - occlusive products should have almost a stickiness to them, which this balm does. However, it accomplishes that sensation with no petroleum-derived ingredients. That is hard to do!  The ingredients contain algae, ginseng, and arnica - three favorites that I don't typically see in such products. It's simple and straightforward - less digging through ingredients for those allergies.  As for results? I wake up with glowing, healthy skin with this balm! Where has this been all my life, goodness!  Quick potential con before I close out: while it works for me, make sure to check the ingredients and patch test. There are some essential oil ingredients that won't work for everyone. But overall, I'm very pleased with this!"

A little goes a long way with this stuff too, which I love because it lasts way longer than a lot of other stuff. Make sure to put it on dry skin though and not damp skin. I love that it lasts all night and when I wake up my skin is dewy and gorgeous. This is great too if you have a damaged skin barrier. I started using retinol a couple months ago, went overboard and my skin started purging as a result. This is amazing at calming my sensitive skin and reducing redness."

I scoop out a small amount (a little more than a pea sized dollop, or a bit more if my skin is extra parched or irritated), warm it a bit on my fingers, and then glide it over my entire face. It feels a bit greasy when you first apply it, but it really melts into your skin and leaves a dewy, moisturized glow. The first time I used this, I woke up to calm, moisturized skin, with reduced redness and sensitivity. I’ve now been using this for over a month, and it consistently leaves my skin calm and glowing, and has not clogged my pores at all - in fact, it has cleared up my acne!

I still decided to try this because my already aggressive facial redness has been embarrassingly and demoralizingly off the charts recently, and as a newbie to skincare, I wasn’t sure where to go to find other brands targeting a reduction and redness and sensitivity. I’m really glad I did, though; this, along with the recovery mask, were the most effective in tackling my rosacea, and when combined together at night left noticeable reduction in my discoloration the following morning. It’s an odd consistency to get used to, and I do wish there was a little more product for the price you’re paying, but overall, if you really want to try this line, this or the mask are your best bets."

I break out easily and am quite fair, and my skin has been really clear since I started using this 3.5 months ago. I just ordered my second jar, so it also lasts a super long time - a little goes a long ways. It also moisturizes my lips well when I apply it there. Really happy I tried this!

My skin is normal/dry, more so in the winter, so this is perfect for when I need to replenish ASAP. It's also fantastic at calming any irritation, so I use it both as a night treatment and/or for spots/areas. I was worried that the balm would be too much on top of moisturizer, but it's not greasy at all! Probably wouldn't use it as much in the summer unless I need to treat irritation, since even though it's not heavy, I think it would be too much, so I also wouldn't necessarily recommend it to those with oily skin- I've never had an issue with it causing congestion, but I'm not acne-prone, so I can't say for sure.

I have rosacea and generally red skin, and within a couple of days I could barely recognize myself in the mirror—my skin was even (vs blotchy) and pretty much free from all redness. I’m skeptical of “wonder products”, because my dehydrated and very sensitive skin always reacts. I struggle to find things that work—but this one truly is different. I still have to hydrate with serum, but this balm locks it it. My face feels comfortable and smooth, and my skins looks great. This balm really is as good as everyone says."

I don't have particularly sensitive skin (I use actives, acids, etc pretty often) but I broke out in small savage clusters that I couldn't tame. It made me seriously avoid any product that had dimethicone as top 3 ingredient (jury is still out whether this ingredient is truly bad for your face but I had to weed out something to see what was wrong) Cue this balm. Not only did it help calm down the stubborn broken out areas but my goddd does it make your skin feel amazing. I woke up with plump, velvety smooth skin the next day. Like wow no other high end moisturizer has done this for me. Dry/combo skin who?   It's a balm but more of a gooey consistency (maybe like honey but not sticky), not a balm you have to scrape out. It spreads out easily from just a little dab. It 'melts' into skin but I wouldn't say it totally disappears instantly, which I like my moisturizers to do because I feel like it creates a little bit of a moisture locking barrier. Plays well with makeup, as well as other things I might add to it like retinol or AHA.  I stan for how REN avoids all the no-nos in skin care. I will repurchase the balm for sure, and because I enjoyed it so much I will definitely be trying out other products in their line. They have a customer for life after just one week of use!"

			"review_text": "So this review is for all of you lovely people who love a terribly long review, and for those of you who don't, I'm sorry. Here is a short version: I love it. Buy it. Now. So the back story: for a long while I told myself I didn't need this. Why do you need it? It's simply an oil. You have oils. Or it's like an overnight mask. You have those too. But I had some extra money and decided to splurge and OH MY GOODNESS GRACIOUS MASHED POTATOES (sorry) NOW I CAN NEVER GO BACK. I use this maybe once a week (okay, maybe twice a week) on nights when my skin is just feeling dull and achy (can skin feel achy?) and I want a little more oomph than the oils can give me (because you know I am going to bed looking like an oil slick so in the morning I look like the goddess I am-I mean, I'm not alone, right?) and boy, oh BOI, does this deliver. It feels beautiful, first of all. It really is like a balm-to-oil texture that is heavenly. You warm it up in your fingers and press it into your skin and it really does an amazing job of recovering your skin from whatever you might have put it through that day / week. I highly HIGHLY recommend this (obviously) and even for all skin types. Because, while I lean on the dry side, I am a firm believer in oily-skinned using oils to keep their oils at bay. I hope that makes sense. Cheers to you if you've made it to the end of this long review! Now go buy this balm!"

I had inflamed my skin with a high-end skin care line that is supposed to be for sensitive skin; it looked like I had a mild case of rosacea, but my skin was flaky and dry too. I researched Ren online, and the sales assistant at Sephora told me how to use this product and raved on it. Boy was she right. I noticed improvement in my skin's moisture level the next morning, but the difference in two weeks is astounding. The rough, red patches on my cheeks are gone and there are no flaky areas anywhere on my face. My skin hasn't looked so good since microdermabrasion several years ago. I am 48 and don't have any deep creases, but my fine lines are smoothing out since starting to use Ren. After the first week of Evercalm, I started using the Bio-retinoid cream before applying my make-up. My foundation glides on so much more easily, and no flaky patches show through within hours anymore. One day i got to work and glanced in a mirror and noticed I'd forgotten foundation and I still looked good! That's never happened before, I wouldn't have forgotten because I needed to tone down redness. I have ordered a few more products from this line to see just how young looking my face can get! So glad to have found Ren!"

I have cut out foods, tried to stick to my same routine, and was still having very angry, blotchy skin.  A co worker even asked me why I was so blotchy!  I tried a different Shiseido moisturizer (my usual go-to because I also love those) and even bought the $110 cream that supposedly helped redness/sensitivity, and think I worsened.  I know everyone is different, but, honestly, after using this line for a week, my skin is no longer red and finally starting to feel normal.  The feel of this balm was off-putting initially, because it felt very thick and kind of sticky.  I was worried it would cause my angry skin to then break out with acne on top of that.  But, no!  It absorbs surprisingly well, and quickly, and was VERY soothing to my skin.  After initially trying this balm, I bought the sample pack (which is still available, I think) and the results were wonderful!  I have purchased full sizes of all, and pray the results continue!

I added in the evercalm global day cream and clay cleanser and this is the BEST my skin has been for about the past 7 years! I highly recommend giving it a shot! I’ve tried the most expensive products and somehow this has blown all of those products out of the water! It’s a gel like texture, so I recommend taking a half dime size amount, letting it melt in your fingers and then rubbing it in on your face and neck. You won’t regret it!"

A wonderful Sephora employee once upon a time helped me realize that my skin was oilier than it should be because I wasn't giving it enough moisture. However, no matter what I put on my face at night, my forehead and nose would be an oil slick in the morning. With this one, my skin is moisturized in the morning, not greasy, and I've been really impressed. I've used it every night for the last 3ish months and I'm only halfway through the container. When I'm travelling, if I'm only going to bring one item from my night time skincare, it's this guy."

When I woke up, not only was my face hydrated and not flaking anymore but it also started to heal my eczema. I used it every night for a week and it completely healed my eczema. I’ve used every product out there for my dry and eczema skin and this was the only one that actually worked within a week. You do not need a lot so this little jar will last you for a while!

If used too quickly it would actually sting, so I wait until my skin has completely dried then put a small amount on. Too much gave me whiteheads by the morning and a greasy feel.

My skin isn't terribly sensitive, and it's mostly combination. Living in the Midwest during these harsh winter months it tends to be dry more often than not. I really hate overpowering my skin with thick creams that tend to sit on the surface so I thought this would finally be the one. It wasn't.  When I started using it a few weeks ago I noticed that I was waking up with strange breakouts mostly on my forehead (where I never get breakouts) and cheeks. It 'kind of' seemed like an irritation since it was a large patch of small bumps but then there were a few big ones mixed in that took a couple of days to go away. I stopped using it for about a week until my skin was clear again then gave it another shot. The exact same thing happened again the first night, but I continued to use it every other day for another week or two hoping maybe my skin just needed to adjust to a new formula. My forehead got pretty out of control so I stopped using it all together and everything cleared up.  I also have to say that I wasn't a huge fan of the sticky residue it left on my skin. I know a few people have said that their skin absorbed it well but that definitely wasn't the case for me, even when using it sparingly.  It seems that this may work well for other skin types but for mine it just didn't seem to agree. I'm giving 2 stars because I do feel bad giving only 1 when it does seem to be a great product for so many others."

I hoped this product would be my answer to redness and sensitivity, but found it to have a mediocre effect on my redness. There is some slight improvement, but I wouldn't say this is a life saver for redness relief. However, it is incredibly moisturizing. I scoop a small amount out with my finger and work it in between a few fingers to loosen it up. It applies like a heavy oil, but it is much harder to apply without massaging it between fingers first. My only issue with the product is that I wake up and my skin still feels greasy. A lot of the product remains on the surface of my skin throughout the night and doesn't soak in. I couldn't dare apply at night and wake up without washing the excess oil off of my face. Perhaps the greasyness of the product is the price I have to pay to elimenate my harsh winter dryness. Overall, it is great as a quick fix for dry skin, and doesn't further irritate my skin at all. (which is a large feat because my skin is very sensitive) But for me I can find better redness relief from other products, with a less greasy after effect."

However, this night cream only took a couple days and my skin loves it. I broke out the first two times I used it, but after that, the breakouts cleared! This has a weird texture, but if you rub it between your fingers first and then add it to your face it works great! A little bit goes a long way, so I imagine this little jar will last a while.

It really melted right in and absorbed really well, leaving my dry skin soft and supple in the morning. I often use my boyfriend as a guinea pig because he has eczema, so I had him try this. He loves it! He thought it was really soothing and gentle. It is kind of expensive, but it I think it could be something to be used occasionally in conjunction with a more budget conscious moisturizer like CereVe. I'd definitely recommend with anyone who battles extra winter time dryness or skin conditions like eczema."

My face felt refreshed and soft and very moisturized. I was pleasantly surprised at how much I loved it! I have several moisturizers that I use but this one I’ve used everyday for a week and the results are amazing. I didn’t feel like I needed a primer in the morning.

Furthermore, you barely need to use any balm to get results. I use a less than a pea sized amount and it works very well.   Like others, I have also seen a reduction in pimples since using this balm. HOWEVER, I think my pores have enlarged since using it. I started using my acid toner again and that should help.

But because I’m not a scientist, none of my efforts were working for acne! I double cleanse with hemp/castor oil, then PAI cream cleanser. And I follow with this balm. In the morning I cleanse with water and apply Josh Rosebrook sunscreen. If you have acne or if you need moisturizer, or...if you are a human being, I recommend this balm!!! I hope they keep making it because it’s literally the best thing I have used. I know everyone says that about every cream, but this one is special. Totally non-comedogenic.

I'm 20 and have had persistent rosacea for around half my life now (which is a lot earlier than most). My rosacea is in the form of constant redness all over my face rather than the more common occasional flare-ups or acne. Its gotten to the point where I will not leave my house without a full face of makeup on to even walk my dogs or get groceries and I have gotten so so so tired of it. Makeup used to be fun but now its just a tedious thing I need to do for an hour every single day. I was hoping this product would make it possible that I could leave my house without the routine for once. I don't need to look pretty, I just want to feel normal.  Although I have used products that tone it down a bit, I've never had anything completely calm the redness so after reading these amazing reviews I had such high hopes! Worst case scenario it wouldn't help redness but would be a good moisturizer.  Well unfortunately after using this product I woke up and the redness was actually a lot worse. I kept using it for a little bit over a week but it just stayed consistently redder than before and the texture of my skin also worsened.   I stopped using the product for about 2 weeks and then gave it another try once my skin recovered just in case and had the same results. I'm not allergic to any of the ingredients so I don't know why it had such negative effects when it seemed to work perfectly fine for everyone else.  If you try this product I hope it works for you like it did for other reviewers! And if not, thank god sephora has such a great return policy."

I can see a huge difference in my skin in the morning. My skin looks much smoother and hydrated. Great product and very much worth it!"

Recently with the changing weather, my skin has been just plain angry. I've tried oils from other brands for my nighttime routine, and I always found that they exacerbated my acne. I also started to find that products with loads of chemical ingredients made my skin waxy and sensitive. This balm is life changing. It's gentle, lightweight, and a little bit goes a long way. I put a small amount over my dry patches and healing acne wounds, and my skin immediately felt nourished and moisturized. It didn't sit on top of my skin like other oils, and I didn't feel like I had to reapply it 10x per day for it to be effective. I will definitely purchase the full-size product during Sephora's upcoming sales. I'm not sure that I'd apply it over my entire face, but just to problem areas. The tiny sample is enough product to last me one or two weeks, so I can imagine that this jar lasts a long time!"

I was surprised at how small this little guy is but let me say WOW! I used this & in one night my chapped skin felt soft & supple. My allergic reaction patches were nearly gone & the even better part is, you barely need much to cover your face. Very impressed & I’ve already told 3 of my friends about it.

Additionally, the balm is greasy and somewhat heavy, and doesn’t absorb into my skin very quickly, as it remains tacky for a long while after application. Not a huge deal overall, since you wear it at night with nothing on top, but if stickiness is a drawback, this product might not be for you.   The reason I still give it three stars and what I really love about this product is how amazingly plump and hydrated my skin feels the next morning (by which point, the stickiness has also gone away). Just touching your skin in the morning, you’ll instantly be able to feel the difference from the night before."

So first of all you need the smallest amount of product, so that’s great. My face the entire month has broken out into mostly cystic acne. I’ve always had acne prone skin, but this was insane. I just gave up as I have no idea what’s going on. It’s not cycling acne in specific places, it’s my whole freaking face continually breaking out. I haven’t had luck with specific, more harsh acne products, so I gave this a chance. Two nights in a row and my skin is calmed down, the risen acne is healed, my face looks smooth and much more calm. I’m sold. So stoked to find this! If your skin is having a freak out, get a sample as it will last you all week. Amazing product."

This Balm is incredible and when I use both products in conjunction with each other my skin is so hydrated and young looking. My skin has completely transformed.  My Tip for using this product: (3x a week)  I cleanse, tone, and use this Balm. Then I put the REN Ultra Comforting Mask on. ( Do not Rinse).  Last step; I use a hydrating face mask to seal in all products. I recommend Too Cool for School, “Hydrating Egg Cream Mask”  Yes, it’s a lot of steps. High maintenance but, I absolutely love the results and my Skin looks incredible"

			"review_text": "My skin has been incredibly reactive lately from stress and environmental changes, and moisturizers (even things like pure rosehip oil or aloe vera) were further irritating my skin even though it was uncomfortably dry. Enter the Overnight Recovery Balm! I've been using it nightly for about a week and a half, and Im very impressed with the results. It hasn't irritated my skin at all, and after the first night of use, my skin was majorly soothed, dry patches hydrated/flakiness had mostly disappeared, and longstanding stubborn texture that I hadn't even attributed to dryness had been smoothed over. It also really sped up the healing time of a few blemishes and spots of irritation from the reactions I'd been having. A week and a half later, this product has absolutely calmed my skin, returned my skin's glow, and restored my moisture barrier.  If you were initially apprehensive due to the size of the product as I was (1 oz as compared to the 1.7 oz typical of a moisturizer), don't be. You need very little product, and you can't even tell I've touched it after a week and a half of use. Balm is definitely the right word for the texture - it feels like a thicker vaseline or cleansing balm in the jar, then melts into a super hydrating oil in your hands/upon application. The oil does not feel too heavy (I've found a lot of oils to be too heavy for my sensitive skin) and sinks in pretty much right away. I've used the product alone as well as over acids and serums/under other moisturizers and still had great success/increased hydration. And the product isn't scented, so great for those with sensitive skin/noses. All in all, HIGHLY recommend the Overnight Recovery Balm to anyone with normal to dry skin and/or sensitive/sensitized skin."

It is definitely heavier texture (almost Vaseline like) so a little goes a long way, but I don’t feel disgustingly sticky (although it is heavier just a warning) and it absorbs in fairly well after a few minutes and hasn’t broken me out! I’d recommend for when fighting dryness, after a more intense exfoliating skin treatments/serums or during the winter months."
