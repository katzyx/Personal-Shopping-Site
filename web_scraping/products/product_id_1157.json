She explained this product has Glutathione which was a superstar ingredient in vitamin c and I have to agree.  This vitamin c has does wonders for my skin, I use tretinoin so there aren't very many products that I try that show a noticeable improvement in my already really good skin but this is one of them.  My skin has such a brightness and glow about it, it has also improved my texture.  It's the dead of winter and freezing here in Canada but this has made my skin look so glowy and bright. I do not have issues with pilling at all as some of the other reviews mention but I use only one pump and always let me products sink in before makeup. The down side is the price, it's very expensive but for me with the results I've seen, it's worth it.  I have been using for just over a month and have about half left.  LOVE THIS!!!"

A little bit goes a long way and I do use it at night only to let the stuff work its magic while I sleep. I protect my skin with sunblock during the day since this will make you sensitive to ultraviolet rays. It does not really get rid of dark spots from aging but it does provide a healthier shine for your skin. I enjoy using it when I want a break from retinol and my bleaching cream. I have normal-dry skin and minimal breakouts and my skin can tolerate mild burning before adjusting from initial use. This can be too strong for people with super sensitive skin."

I haven’t noticed ANY smell that the other reviews mention. I’ve only used for a week and I won’t comment on any differences in skin at this time.

I bought this to help my dark spots, but it also helped even out my skin tone and I didn't even know that it was THAT uneven until trying this stuff. Not only has it helped me in both of these areas, but my breakouts have significantly decreased especially around that time of month.

Im a but curious if i will have any issues with it in the winter when my skin is more dry but so far ive had no problems in the ~6 weeks ive used it. My skin is definitely smoother (likely from the glycolic acid) which is great! Ive not been using it long enough to fade any hyperpigmentation with any notable results but i have noticed a slight reduction in one particular spot that is likely attributable to this product. I highly recommend if you are someone slightly sensitive to other ascorbic acid products...this one just might work for you!"

Admittedly beautiful, the bottle consists of clear hard  plastic on the outside with two small orange plastic containers on the inside, each containing different parts of the serum that are mixed when pumped out. Recyclable? Hardly.  In addition, you cannot effectively dispense all of the product, due to the design. There will always be about 10% of the product left at the bottom of the inner orange containers no matter how many times you pump the dispenser, turn it upside down, or even try to dismantle it (which I did) - the packaging is made of such hard plastic, you can't cut it or otherwise access a fairly substantial amount that you can see, but will always be left on the bottom.  The product itself is good, but not great. You will feel a tingling sensation when you use it, suggesting that it works. Unless your face is properly cleansed and toned, be careful, as you may experience breakouts with it. I have switched to using Skinceuticals c e ferulic, which I'm much happier with.  I implore the manufacturer to rethink their packaging. If every company made products like this, the environmental repercussions would be dire."

It could be purging due to the glycolic acid; which upon further investigation seems to be the main ingredient after water. Ascorbic acid is actually rather far down in the ingredients list. It is also sketchy that the percentages are not advertised (at least not here). Switching to Skinceuticals C E Ferulic to see how that works out - which does not contain glycolic acid (just ascorbic acid, vitamin e and ferulic acid)."

My overall skin tone and texture has been consistently brighter and smoother. I hardly wear foundation anymore because of how clear my skin is! TBH - my darker age spots are still there and I don't expect them to go away completely, but they don't seem as rough or obvious.   I have relatively sensitive skin that gets red in the cheeks. Zero irritation. No bumpy skin, no redness or itching. The serum is silky and absorbs without any greasy or slippery silicone feeling that many Vitamin C products have. I'm sure there's a smell, but it isn't worth noting since I didn't even notice it.   Tip: Keep skin exfoliated (but don't over do it) and this and other products will work better.  Love. I don't usually continuously use a product for so long! The bottle is about half empty and I plan on buying it again. Worth the price."

The serum has Vitamin C which is a major factor in ensuring these results and having used various other products in the past, I have to say that this product definitely blew me away with the results so far having used it for a few days. I continue to use it everyday and can hopefully write up a follow up review after a couple of weeks as well. The smoothness and oily texture takes away dark spots and also keeps my skin supple. I highly recommend it and will definitely be on the lookout to buy this once it is done if the results stay the same. I know a few people on this site may have spoken about the odd scent, but I personally had no issue with this."

The only reason I am dinging it a star is because I'm confused about hydroquinone, an ingredient used to lighten skin tones and touted as a highlighted ingredient in one of the other Murad products that I'm using, but falls in the [negative] ingredient callouts shown in this listing - that has me a bit concerned.

I have freckles all over, which I’m not a fan of anyway, but aside from them my skin just seemed darker and begging for moisture. I loved the way this product felt on the skin, so nice and smooth. Also it’s not a drastic difference- which I LOVE bc I wasn’t looking for a drastic difference. To be quite honest I was nervous to try it Incase it were. I noticed small differences early; so results didn’t take long to see- just not huge altering changes.

I attached a before and after picture making sure I used the same lighting (ring light) in both pictures. Now I do have oily skin and for me the combination of using this product in addition to the Rapid Age Spot and Pigment Lightening Serum, the Vita-C Eyes Dark Circlr Corrector and sunscreen it left my face really feeling greasy but thankfully not enough to cause any break outs. Maybe it's just too many products being used at one time. As far as results go I feel like 2 weeks was enough time to see some results but not it's full potential. As you can see by the scar on the right side of my face down by my lip I had a scar that lightened considerably in just two weeks of use. Its actually barely noticeable now where as before I couldnt even cover it with my foundation. Since I was using 2 serums (Brightening serum and Lightening serum) I cant pin point if one or the other did it or the combination of the two working together. But clearly using this line of products is going to give you some results. As far as scents go I dont have a sensitive nose but there is a slight chemical scent with these products. If you are sensitive to smells I'd suggest going to a store location and checking out the smell in person if you can."

The smell is very chemically as opposed to the rest of the line which has the classic orange smell. I did notice a brightening quality after using and it has gotten rid of some sun damage next to my nose. The packaging is great too. It works perfectly combining the serum and the vitamin C. I feel the need to not wear makeup, and during this quarantine that's a life saver. Summer's coming up and I feel this will be perfect to show off healthy skin (though be careful, it says to stay out of direct sun or wear sunscreen with this due to the nature of the product)"

This serum made  my face super soft after applying it, but I did not notice that much improvement in my stubborn dark spots. This product also has a very distinctive smell that I can't say I love. It smells very chemical-y, which I was surprised about since most vitamin C products smell like oranges to me, but those are probably artificial additives. Overall, I give this product 4 stars because although it did not fade all my dark spots, it did give my skin a slight glow and made it softer after application. Also to note, this is a two part serum (comes in two tubes within the actual bottle), and one part of the serum has shimmer in it; not enough to be obnoxious, but enough to notice a slight glow to your face."

The Murad Serum leaves no sticky residue on my face and once absorbed you cannot tell its on your skin by feeling it. My face feels fresh, soft and hydrated. After using it for a few weeks I thought my skin looked much better than before. It looked brighter and I thought that some of the discoloration I had before was gone or at least much less noticeable. There is a great amount of product in the bottle as well and because you do not have to use a lot to cover large areas, it will last you a long time. I will definitely be continuing to use it and repurchase it after this bottle is gone."

This product legitimately brightened my skin over the span of 2 weeks and helped smooth out that splotchy just woke up look.   My mom also tried this product.  She has oilier skin and also struggles with dull skin. She loved how absorbent the formula was and found her skin didn't feel sticky after use. Both of us loved the citrusy smell of the serum and it definitely made our faces feel plumper and fresher. The cost is steep but if money wasn't an issue I would definitely give this five stars. I did receive this sample as a BzzAgent, but it didn't influence the overwhelmingly positive results of this product. I loved how this product solved my splotchy bed face in two weeks and I would definitely buy it again if it was cheaper."

It’s a great formula that is easy to apply. It’s lightweight, which is great since I have oily skin and heavier formulas are too heavy for my skin. Obviously, it has Vitamin-C in it, which is PERFECT for what’s going on in the world right now. The Vitamin C Glycolic Brightening Serum is a product that I would continue to use. However, it is quite expensive, so I'm not sure if it's a product that I would be able to purchase again.

I wouldn’t say that I was unhappy with my skin prior to this product, but with being so pale something that is supposed to give a “glow” to the skin interests me. Here is my take on the product:  Positives: Skin looks more radiant and when first applied definitely has a glowy sheen (not sparkly, but almost appears to reflect light) Makes skin look and feel plump  Doesn’t leave a sticky feeling  Leaves your skin feeling really soft Didn’t irritate my sensitive skin   Negatives: Has a tingly sensation when applied to the skin Can make skin feel dry if you don’t moisturize after High price tag  Overall I am happy with this product, I think the high price tag would have made me hesitate to buy the product, but I will continue to use this product and if I continue to see these results I would purchase it again!!!"

It was just too harsh, but this is definitely a more gentle glycolic acid. I feel like this formula will work for most people. Definitely pair it with a sunscreen! I picked up the Murad Environmental Shield Essential-C Day Moisture with SPF to use while trying this out and it complimented it well! I live in sunny FL and I have not had issues with my face burning. I love that the formula is not greasy, absorbs fast, and does not break me out. The packaging is esthetically pleasing! My only complaint is the pump. If it is not completely flat when you are pressing it, the product distribution is slightly off. It’s not something that would keep from purchasing this product. I definitely recommend this serum if you are looking for a product that helps with the smoothness and overall radiance of your skin!

The serum is very light weight which is a plus for me and you only need a small drop to go over your face. The serum will last you a good amount of time too. It isn't sticky when you apply it either and dries very fast too.   The serum does have one flaw that I didn't like much which was the smell when you first put it on and the fact that it dries my skin out after I wear it. So for me I always have to wear a facial moisturizer after I apply it."
