I took it with me to Vegas, and after 4 days, you can see that I’m already down to only a few uses left with one of the colours! I really loved the feel of the product, however it definitely took a lot of product to get good coverage. I was also using a brush- so no product wasted with a sponge. Knowing I’m going to run out one colour way before all of the others, and given that I can’t replace the individual colours, it pretty much deems the palette useless for its intended purpose as a “one stop shop” to take with me travelling. For $120 Canadian, it feels extremely overpriced for a product’s novelty that no longer serves its purpose after its first use."

I didn't love the blush colors (I prefer more neutral pinks and peaches) and I found the contour shades to be extremes of cool and warm. it's not a bad product, just not worth the $88 price point in my opinion. if it goes on a steep sale I'd consider picking it up again."

I use all of the blushes and highlights together to make the perfect flush cheek look and because my skin is so pale the dark blushes also look really great as a sunburn style bronze.

Being of a medium skin tone, I was torn between choosing between the Light to Medium vs Tan to Deep, but went with the darker palette because the shades had more contrast.   Pros: So creamy and pigmented! I love that I can customize the blush shades by mixing certain colors/highlighter. My skin has never looked so healthy. Not greasy either (I have combination/dry skin). They are also SUPER easy to blend and it seamlessly harmonized with all my other makeup products.  Cons: On my skin tone, the lightest shades don't serve as brightening concealer, which is fine since I can just use something else. The palette is meant to serve Tan to Deep skin tones anyway. The darker shades are more leaning towards warm/orange or pink undertone, which are nice for bronzing my face but not great for contouring. Again, I can use something else.  Overall, I still think this is a great product that's worth the money and will be a staple in my collection!"

The deeper shades of blush are more pigmented and matte. Varied and seasonal looks can be achieved with the included colours. The contour shade is subtle and perfect. The consistency is that of finger paint (which I appreciate, as I like to apply product that way, and because it is ideal for mature skin), however, once applied, the colours stick well and don’t budge. Results are highly blended and natural, and require very little else, just powder, eyeliner, maybe. Should’ve bought one for home, car and every purse."

			"review_text": "As someone with fair skin I'm pretty disappointed in the balance of light and dark shades in the complexion side. I expected the palette to be geared towards a medium complexion and that I would need to put in a bit more effort to get it to work on my fair skin. I wasn't expecting a palette labelled light/medium to be geared towards medium/tan skin.  MUFE divides their complexion shades into light, medium, tan and deep with 8 shades per category. The light/medium palette includes: ---2 light shades (1N00 which is the lightest shade in this section, 1R12 which is the second darkest) ---1 medium shade (2N22 which is the second lightest in this section) ---2 tan shades (3N42 which is the third lightest in this section, 3N52 which is the darkest) ---1 deep shade (4N68 which is the fourth lightest in this section).  So someone with a tan complexion has a better chance of matching/blending the complexion shades in the light/medium palette than I do with my light (1N00/1N06) complexion. I've watched videos of makeup artists and makeup enthusiasts use this palette and they seem to bounce around the complexion side using different shades to highlight or contour. To make the tan and deep shades workable I have to blend in 1N00, and even then I'm pulling very orange. And I'm using so much 1N00 that I would go through it very quickly. Refills aren't available/an option so the palette would quickly become unusable.  As for how it wears, I've only had it on for 4 hours and am experiencing fading on my cheeks and forehead. I've also gotten very oily across my nose and under my eyes. I set it with powder but it's wearing very poorly."

This palette is incredibly versatile, making it a must-have for anyone on the go. Whether you need a quick touch-up throughout the day or want to create a full face base, this palette has you covered. Personally, as a busy individual, I find it convenient to carry it in my purse and do quick makeup touch-ups in the car. With this palette, I can conceal dark circles, blemishes, and under eyes effortlessly. Additionally, it offers blush options, highlighters, and contour shades for a complete look.  One of the standout features of this palette is the range of color options available. From concealer shades to blushes and highlighters, there's something for every skin tone and occasion. However, if I were to point out a downside, it would be that I find myself favoring one of the concealer shades over the rest. When that particular shade runs out, I'll be disappointed, but it doesn't take away from the overall quality of the palette.  In conclusion, I absolutely love the Milk Makeup Forever HD Skin Face Essentials Full Face Cream Palette for its versatility, convenience, and excellent color options. It has quickly become a staple in my purse for on-the-go touch-ups, and I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a multi-functional makeup solution."

The formulas have great pigmentation and are easy to use and blend. I’d say they give a light to medium coverage and are buildable. Just be mindful of the tools you use with this as the product can pick back up if you’re not careful. I found that to be true especially with the highlighter shades—applying with my fingers has been best, but you want to take your time and warm up the product first.  My other concern is about the packaging. I love the setup very much. It’s super convenient and perfect for travel. Not bulky at all! However, the hinge part that’s holding it together gives me the impression that it will come apart at some point down the line. I may be wrong, and I hope I am, but that is a concern.

Note that I have fair skin, and I went into this palette expecting to be able to use some, but not all, of the shades. Instead, I can actually use every single shade included.  First off, I noticed a texture difference between the base shades and the blush/highlight shades. Let’s start by going over the base/foundation shades. These feel like true creams. They start with a good amount of pigment and easily blend together. I found that blending the top two shades gave me a good “foundation” shade. From there, I am finding I like to use the center shades to build up faux contour/bronzer around the perimeter of my face (for a natural look). For a more glam look, the bottom two shades are a perfect warm bronzer and cool contour. These have a radiant finish and set beautifully with a dab of powder. I will note I initially struggled a bit with figuring out what brush to use. I have settled on a smaller brush designed for cream application, and prefer to use a sponge to finalize blending the entire base on my face.  The blush/highlight side has a much more emollient feel to it. As such, I found it was best to simply dip my fingers into these shades and tap gently on my skin to reduce lines of demarcation. I am SO happy to tell you that every one of these shades works well for my fair skin, and yet I do think these could work for medium skin as well. They are incredibly buildable! With one “dip” in the shades, I get a very light application, making even the two deepest shades a good fit (see photos: shade deep rose). Naturally with my fair skin, I worried the most about the deepest shades - yet I love them!  All in all, this palette is incredibly versatile, and I think MUFE really got it right in designing two shade options. I believe I am able to use every shade here because of this choice, while only one shade option might make that impossible. It’s a very impressive launch!"

This palette is versatile because it can be used for literally everything for your face. I love that it is a contour, highlight, correcting, blush, foundation, and concealer. This palette is good on the go because you don't need to pack a lot of makeup so you save yourself so much space! This palette is so easy to mix and blend shades together because it so so creamy. Also, I love how you can easily build coverage depending on what type of makeup look you are trying to achieve from a bold to no makeup look. In addition, this lasted me all day without having to retouch throughout the day! Overall, I feel like this palette is such a great idea especially for people that are always traveling."

I freaking LOVE the bush shades and the foundation and concealer shades are beautiful.

While the pans appear to be removable, individual replacements aren't available for purchase on the website. Despite appearing dark inside the pans, the deeper shades blend seamlessly and are excellent for contouring. All the shades can easily be mixed and matched to match your skin tone, eliminating the need to purchase several different shades of foundation throughout the year. I love how creamy the shades are and how they make my skin look like my skin but better!   To avoid ending up with a messy looking palette, apply the shades with your fingers directly onto the face, then blend using a dense brush with short bristles."

I didn’t expect to love it this much because I honestly doubted my skills of applying cream makeup but I cannot believe how good it came out (and again I am NOT good at applying cream makeup)! I did my entire face with this singular palette. Concealer, foundation, blush, bronzer, and highlight! Because of all the color options everything is customizable and buildable (if your makeup looks a little too dark, you could add a little bit of a lighter shade and it’s fixed)! It also does not feel heavy or cakey on your face. It’s so smooth and applies so nice. I will say I applied everything with brushes and for the little bit of the lighter sparkle for highlighter I used my finger. I think you could do your eyebrows and lips with this palette too. I cannot stress enough how amazing this palette is. I truly mean it when I say I am not good at putting on cream makeup but whatever magic is in this, for the first time in my 25 years of life was able to do AMAZING cream makeup. I did not use a single other product on my face (no powder, no other concealer, no other foundation, no other bronzer, no other blush, or no other highlighter). I’m obsessed and I recommend this 100000%! I attached before and after pictures just for reference as well!"

I used this palette to do a full face one day and was even able to create a perfect base shade for my skintone along with being able to use the palette for blush contour and even highlight. If I had to pick a favorite shade in the palette it would be a cool toned shade that I use to contour, I love when brands have cool toned contour shades! Lastly I love how compact this palette is, not only does it fit well in my kit but it would also fit well in my purse too!"
