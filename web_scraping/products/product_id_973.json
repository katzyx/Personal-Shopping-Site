			"review_buyer_description": "Green eyes, blonde hair, lightMedium skin tone, Combination skin",
			"review_text": "The lash band is incredibly thick and veryyyyy sticky, but unfortunately because it sticks to everything, it’s hard to properly manipulate into the right spot. Im guessing this is targeted towards beginners but you’re better off with regular lashes and glue. The thickness of the band is a little ridiculous as well, but if you are doing a heavier look with liner, you might be able to get it to blend in."

Sometimes if I’m lucky I’ll be able to wear it a second time. But for the most part I see them as a one time use thing, which is expensive and annoying. I’ve ever tried to buy dry them to make them more sticky like lily says to do, but it did not work. Wish they actually were reusable because then I’d give it five stars!"

I love the convenience of the lashes already having glue, making these super easy to apply and great for travel. Now- I really like the tapered design of these. They’re shorter by your tear ducts and get longer towards the outer edges of your eye. This follows the lengths of my natural eyelashes, making these lashes a bit more natural looking and less crazy. I’m not into eyelashes chomping at people when I blink so I like the more natural style of these. They were fairly easy to apply (I’m not the greatest at applying as it is) and I loved not having to mess with glue. They’ve stayed on without issue for the last 6 hours so far. Also, really like that you can get 3-5 uses out of these without adding your own glue but after that, you can still keep using them by adding glue."

When it comes to application I didn’t need to trim the lashes but it did take 2 tries on my first eye to get the hang of application.  The band is a little thicker than I would want but not a deal breaker. They’re voluminous but natural looking while on and removal was easy. I have naturally oily eyelids and did not find issue with them slipping and sliding as the day went on. It states up to 5 wears and I think if you take care of them you will get your moneys worth. I am not an everyday lash wearer but this item would solve that problem for me."
