			"review_text": "It is lovely and hydrating after I cleanse and before I do the rest of my skincare. I use it morning and night. If my skin is extra dry, I will use two layers of this‚Äîthe first layer, then let it soak in for a minute, and then I pat on a second layer. It makes a really big difference for my dry skin. In the mornings, I like the way my makeup goes on over top. I went through my first bottle very quickly but I will be repurchasing."
