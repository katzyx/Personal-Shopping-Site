It does brighten the undereye and other areas of the face that I wanted to brighten a bit. The formula is a light serum, slight smell, and glides smoothly on the skin, especially the undereye. It doesn't look cakey after it sets nor does it dry out my skin. This concealer does give a slight sheen, which I'm not too much of a fan, however, with a little dusting of loose powder, it lessened the sheen. If you do use it on your face instead of foundation, which I did a number of times, it was a light medium coverage, but you can build it for more coverage. Did it crease on me? Yes, but only a little. Most concealers crease on me anyways, even if I lightly powder, however, this one creased less than others that I have used. I can't say if it has any flashback (for those who love to take selfies :) so I can't speak on that, however, when a concealer feels like nothing on my skin, even with 2 layers, and lasts more than 8 hours on me, even without powder, I will repurchase again. Only one star off because of the sheen, but overall, this is one of my favorite concealers."

After putting this concealer on, my under eyes are a total mess - it clumps up and also settles into and accentuates my fine lines immediately.  Even when I put on the tiniest amount, it still settles and creases.  And setting it with powder doesnu2019t help either.  Iu2019ve had much better luck with Haus labs concealer.  Itu2019s thicker, so it conceals dark areas and blemishes better than this concealer, it looks smoother on my skin, and it settles into wrinkles way less than this Tower 28 concealer.  I will give it 4 stars because this concealer works really well to set my eyelids for eyeshadow.  I put powder on top of the concealer, and then the shadow.  No matter what eyeshadow I use - matte, shimmer, or glitter - it stays put all day.  No fallout, no creasing, no clumping."

Iu2019ve used the NYX u201cbear with meu201d concealer for the last couple years but recently itu2019s been flaking off of my chin and cheeks within a few hours of application and the coverage isnu2019t great. I tried two more concealers after that, including Tarte Shape Tape ultra creamy and they didnu2019t do it for me either so I decided to give this one a try and Iu2019m glad I did. The coverage is amazing and the shade is perfect and blends so easily and doesnu2019t dry me out. It stays all day, doesnu2019t flake off and feels so lightweight on the skin.

The cheap price was enticing, and it feels nice going on, but the coverage is EXTREMELY sheer and it dries out sooo fast. I barely had time to blend it. It's not very buildable or blendable after the first swipe. It made my dark circles look gray, so if you have dark circles DON'T go lighter bc it won't give you that brightening effect. You need to match it to your exact skin tone instead. If you have dry skin, please skip this as well as it will crease (even with setting powder). Times like this remind me to take virality with a grain of salt. I think this would be great for young person (like teenager) w/o dark circles who has combo or oily skin. If you have dry skin and are looking for legit coverage, look elsewhere. The Sephora employee suggested I swap this for Hourglass and I'm so glad I did. HG has more coverage than T28 but is not as cakey as Too Faced. Nars is also a good option."

I naturally have prominent under eye creases and concealer also finds its way into them. This is the only concealer that will dry down enough to where creasing is very minimal or not there at all! The only other concealer that works for me is the maybelline fitme concealer, I think because it also has a dryer formula. But I love tower 28u2019s coverage and finish better. Very good coverage and buildable. Thank you Tower 38! Also I am almost always the lightest shade in every range and the color 2.0 BUT is a perfect match for me. ufffc"

            "review_text": "I went from having oily skin to developing a problem dry T-zone that no matter how much I moisturize becomes extremely dry throughout the course of the day. My longtime concealer was not cutting it anymore so I've been on the hunt for something that will work for dry skin. This concealer looked very promising. First, it goes on beautifully, provides excellent coverage that is indeed buildable, and gives a natural, skin-like appearance. My skin looks hydrated and dewy when I first apply and for most of the day after it has dried down. It also lasts really well throughout the day -- blemishes I'd covered in the morning are still completely covered and not noticeable by the end of the day. However, by the end of the day my usual dry patches do begin to show. This concealer is definitely performing better than my old one, but it hasn't completely solved my problem. I also think the shade range could be developed further. I have fair neutral skin that leans a tiny bit cool and initially I thought I wasn't going to be able to find an appropriate match for me b/c the 1.0 BH fair neutral shade looks VERY yellow before it dries down, and the next best shade was a light with neutral cool undertones that looks way too dark and orangey on me. I was happily surprised to see that 1.0 BH got a little darker and less yellow as it dried down and in the end is almost a perfect match for my skin tone. If you're struggling finding a good shade match, try swatching a few and wait until they dry down completely to see if they're a good match. I ended up using the light neutral/cool shade as a color corrector under my eyes before applying the fair neutral shade to brighten."

Like, you can literally feel how heavy it is, and its a lot more product than I usually get in any other concealer. And can we talk about the price??? I feel like most concealers are usually between 27-35 dollars, but this concealer is only 22?! And again, it is a LOT of product, which feels like a steal tbh. Anyway, the product itself is also really good. I mean, you still need some sort of eye cream or primer underneath, but like, that's how it is with all concealers, so not judging. Although it does look pretty natural without something underneath, and despite it being medium coverage, it definitely helps reduce the appearance of pimples!! Anyway yeah I'm not even gonna bother with any other concealer,I'm sticking with this one :)"

I compared it to the kosas concealer and the kosas looked really patchy and was harder to blend, and the kosas is ten dollars more with less product.

I am more than in love with this product because not only does it have great coverage, but the application feels smooth and lightweight. I used to use a brush to blend my concealer but with the serum-like feel to the product, I only use my finger to apply it. I actually find it better to apply the product with my finger since it has a very creamy formula. I have recommended this product to my best friends and my sister-in-law, and they still use it to this day.

I have eczema and dryness around and underneath my eyes but because of the serum formula it doesnu2019t irritate or dry my under eyes out at all. It also doesnu2019t look creasy and has a good buildable coverage. Itu2019s the perfect concealer for covering blemishes as well because the concealer looks very skin like and doesnu2019t patch up over pimples like other concealers do. I always like to set this concealer with a powder and it lasts me all day!"
