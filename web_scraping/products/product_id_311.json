Already on my 3rd bottle and I will forever keep repurchasing!"

I have suuper dry hair so I use a pump every other day and I don't see significant build-up before wash day. I noticed I don't have to straighten my hair again before my next wash day because my style stays locked in. I think this product helped with that! It seems like it will last me for a while!

This isn’t just a leave-in conditioner—it’s a whole experience. 💭✨  I’m someone who’s constantly chasing that “just had a luxurious hair treatment” feeling but with zero effort (because, let’s be real, who has time?). Enter this baby—a lightweight cream that somehow manages to make my hair feel like silk without weighing it down. 🌬️💕  My experience: The first time I used it, I applied it to damp hair after washing, and OMG—my comb glided through like butter. No tangles, no drama. By the time my hair dried, it felt soft, smooth, and perfectly hydrated, but not greasy or heavy. Like, hello, balance? I didn’t know you could exist in a leave-in!  I even tried it on dry hair before heading out on a no-wash day, and wow—it revived my ends and made me look like I actually cared about my hair (spoiler: I hadn’t touched it in days).  Why it’s special:  Smells so clean and elegant—like a subtle, expensive hug. 🕊️ Leaves your hair shiny, soft, and frizz-free, but still lightweight. Perfect for anyone embracing a minimalist beauty routine (or secretly lazy like me). Final thoughts: It’s like a little crown for your strands—pure TLC in a bottle. If you’re into effortless haircare that delivers, this is it. Oh, and the chic packaging? A total bonus for my aesthetic shelf. 😍  This one’s staying in my haircare lineup, forever and always. 💌✨"

I have very long thick full bleached hair so I can only use good products on my hair and I hate spending $50 on leave in conditioner that feels like sticky syrup.

Pros: pretty packaging, lovely smell Cons: Watery product, expensive for amount of product/consistency, didn't prevent frizz or help with dryness  I'll start by saying that I actively avoid using products with silicone in them (I've found this works best for my hair), but this was a last minute decision I figured I'd try out because it has pretty packaging and they were sold out of the guava ceremonia leave in, which I've recently discovered I love. I have fine to medium 3c curly hair and it EATS leave in conditioner- it's pretty dry and I've got some damaged ends from when I used to dye my hair as well. This bottle barely lasted me three weeks. The formula is really watery, which wouldn't bother me if I liked how the product was working. But, I feel like it did nothing to help my hair. I tried adding it on my hair when wet, damp, and dry, I finger combed, used a wide tooth comb, and tried a Felicia Leatherwood brush to see if anything would make a difference with no success. My curls were left flat and undefined/frizzy every time. It was like I just put something on my hair and it sat there on top of it, doing nothing- literally running out of my hair every time it got wet whether it be from walking in the rain or taking a shower, it left milky colored water dripping from my hair. 2 stars for packaging/bottle and smell; however, I do not recommend this product for any type 3 or 4 curls."

Of course, I can talk about Crown Affair without mentioning the scent. It is light, refreshing, and uplifting. The he scent lingers for the first day, and I love that."

			"review_text": "Hey Beauties!    The ultimate do-it-all hair cream to revive and enhance your natural strands. It’s a versatile, buildable, and lightweight formula that hydrates damp hair post-shower and refreshes dry hair between washes. It reduces frizz and flyaways by smoothing strands and adds definition to your hair’s texture without heaviness or stickiness. Its hydrating properties help restore dry or damaged hair to its natural state while also protecting from future damage.  Think of your haircare routine like you would with skincare. You moisturize your skin after cleansing or when it feels dry, and you should be doing the same to your hair. If you aren’t using The Leave-In Conditoner yet, take this as your sign to start.   Due to its lightweight nature, how much you use will depend on the length, density, and porosity of your hair, so feel free to play around with it to find the perfect dosage for you. Because it’s easily buildable, you can start with a small amount and add more until your hair looks and feels the way you want it to. Can be used daily or as needed on damp or dry hair.  Key Ingredients: Tsubaki Seed Oil~ Deeply moisturizes, adds shine, and strengthens strands without weight.  Meadowfoam Seed Oil~ A heat protectant and emollient that softens and hydrates hair.  Fragrance Description:  Their signature fragrance blend combines bergamot, yuzu, and lemongrass for a cool, light scent.  I'm so happy with the way this is helping my hair. It looks stronger, healthier, shiner, moisturized, and more nourished since I started using this leave in the conditioner. I love how lightweight this is. For my baby fine hair, I found a little went a long way. It didn't weigh my hair down or leave it feeling sticky or tacky.   Products Shown:  @CrownAffair~ The Leave In Conditioner"

This luxurious product transformed my hair, leaving it feeling incredibly soft, manageable, and beautifully nourished.  One of the things that immediately stood out to me was the delightful scent. The fragrance is both calming and invigorating, making it a joy to apply. As I worked the conditioner through my damp hair, I could feel it working its magic, instantly detangling and smoothing out any knots or frizz.  What impressed me the most was the lightweight formula. Despite being incredibly moisturizing, it didn't weigh my hair down or leave any sticky residue. It effortlessly absorbed into my strands, providing deep hydration without compromising on volume or body.  After using the Crown Affair Leave-In Conditioner for a few weeks, I noticed a significant improvement in the overall health and appearance of my hair. It felt stronger, looked shinier, and even seemed to be more resistant to breakage and split ends.  I also appreciate the brand's commitment to using clean, high-quality ingredients. The Crown Affair Leave-In Conditioner is free from harmful chemicals and instead harnesses the power of natural extracts to deliver exceptional results.  In conclusion, I wholeheartedly recommend the Crown Affair Leave-In Conditioner to anyone looking to elevate their haircare routine. It's a truly transformative product that leaves your hair feeling nourished, silky, and incredibly healthy."

This leave-in conditioner is a game-changer: my hair is left tame, less frizz, less crunch, less of a tangled mess. It's super lightweight so no greasy after feel however it does get dirty faster.

I suffer a lot from frizz and this has been a game changer for me in naturally reducing my frizz. The frizz still exists and will probably never go away but at least it has gotten better. This product also smells great! I haven’t seen anything about this acting as an air dry cream so not sure if it’s just me but it has also helped with air drying my hair faster. I have the JVN air dry cream and I think this one works better."

Seeing as though I recently put a decent amount of blonde back in my hair, my hair needed all of the hydration I could give it, so I was super excited to try this out!  So far, I have used this several times, but only on dry hair. In the second photo, I had placed two (2) pumps of the product on the left side of my hair (right side of the photo) and I could definitely tell a difference in the definition and hydration of my curls - especially the ends! In the first photo, I had applied it to my entire head of hair. It's a cream, yes, but it feels a little tackier than a traditional cream hair product, so it really helps tame my flyaways. I also love the scent, so I will absolutely enjoy continuing to use this! I'll also test it as a leave-in conditioner and will update you all with my experience in a future empties post."

I’m not the biggest fan of the scent but I love the formula nonetheless."

I take a full pump after towel-drying my hair and apply from ends to aboutn mid-shaft of my hair (around my ears).  I find that this Leave-In really nourishes and moisturizes my hair nicely. This Leave-In is made with Tsubaki Seed Oil, to deeply moisturize, add shine, and strengthen strands without weight - I find all of this to be true!  I typically use the Olaplex #6 Leave-In Conditioner. Although I am really enjoying this Crown Affair Leave-In, I will probably go back to my Olaplex #6 due to the the way signature Olaplex ingredients work wonders on my hair, as well as I can't justify this hefty price tag when Olaplex is less expensive...

I've been using this in my hair to just add a bit of extra moisture and so far so good, I did experience a little bit of frizz with this product, but I think just a small amount of gel on top will do the trick to lock in the hydration and smooth my textured hair a bit."

With this leave-in conditioner, I was left with much softer and smoother hair, and I'm so happy about it! Most leave-in conditioners I've tried are thick and heavy, but this one is very light weight which I find better for my fine, thin hair. I also appreciated the light, but pleasant scent of this hair product. I would definitely consider this leave-in conditioner if you are in the market for one, especially if you have hair like mine.

I’ve struggled to find a hair care brand that I truly love and I’ve never been loyal to any one line or brand until I found Crown Affair through an influencer I follow. I rarely write reviews but felt compelled to because I love this brand and their ethos so much!  Formula: Per the instructions, I use this a few times a week after showering and apply it to wet/damp ends after combing them out. It dries super weightlessly (a must for my very fine hair) and smooths and hydrates my damaged, dry ends. I love how lightweight and non-greasy the formula is. I’ve heard it compared to a lotion which is totally accurate!   Packaging: The packaging is very luxurious, heavy, and feels high quality. I do get a tiny bit nervous about having a glass container on my sink since I can be kind of clumsy and I’m really nearsighted. As a designer, I appreciate how clean and minimal the aesthetic is.  Scent: I have a very sensitive nose (and terrible allergies) but the scent of this doesn’t irritate me at all. The scent is strong but not overpowering and lasts till the 2nd (and sometimes even 3rd day) after initial application. My partner (who is also sensitive to smells) loves it and is constantly sniffing my hair and telling me how good it smells.   Price: My only gripe is that the price point is very high. Between the Ritual Conditioner, Renewal Mask, and Leave-In Conditioner, I would probably only pick one to repurchase since they are all so expensive. Probably the Leave-In because it’s my favorite in terms of thickness, texture, and ease of use and fits my needs best."

Stellar Ingredients:  Tsubaki-seed oil (drawn from seeds of the camellia oleifera wildflower, that works to moisturize and nourish the hair, keeping flyaways and frizz away in the process. The meadowfoam oil, which is a kind of emollient that also works as a heat protectant. It turns out these ingredients were exactly what my thick, coarse, and frizzy teen daughters hair needed.

It’s a little too light weight for me to use as my sole conditioner, but I rely on it for post shower and day 2/3 style touch ups.  My hair gets pretty dry and I rub 2 pumps in the palms of my hand and use this to augment my style and give it a bit of definition.  It’s not heavy at all and can totally brush out without any clumping.  It also adds a luxurious soft texture to my hair, it makes it feel silky and less brittle, and is sooooo great post blow-dry to calm down my freezies when out weighing them down.  I do wish it was just a little bit more heavy duty, but for touch ups it is perfection."

This product is recommended for fine hair, please keep that in mind. My con was the smell. The fragrance was strong in my opinion. My fiancé said that it smells like a pleasant room spray. The fragrance lingers which some people would love. I did not mind it, but I prefer a lighter scent."

Pretty much everything I want without using more than one product. It passes the hand test too. After I apply a product to my damp hair I rub my hands together to see if there is a sticky or waxy residue. If there is I know I’m probably gonna have a flat hair day. This is my winner. It leaves my hands soft and silky. And the bottle is GORGEOUS and solid glass too. The scent smells so fresh. Also if you have thicker hair you may need way more than me."

It immediately makes my hair softer, helps with tangles and once my hair is dry, it looks and feels healthier and shinier. I also followed the recommendations in the box and used it on dry hair in between washes to help style it and to take care of frizz. It hydrated and nourishes my hair without feeling heavy, and the formula feels very silky soft. Highly recommend!"

This product feels pretty good going on, and it seems to provide light moisture and makes my hair feel soft at first. For me, this conditioner fails in two ways: it does not offer nearly enough hydration and, despite containing dimethicone, my hair was a tangled mess by end of day. My hair never tangles… even if I don’t use conditioner. After using this products, I woke up with what felt like a bird’s nest on the back of my head, despite using a satin pillow case. That was a huge disappointment. TBH, I might purchase this again bc I am obsessed with the fragrance, but only if I can find an additional leave-in  product to compensate for the lack of moisture and detangling from this conditioner."

My hair is very very thick and a little frizzy. I use the crown affair oil when my hair id wet to detangle and then I use the leave in conditioner when my hair is dry. For instance if I wash my hair at night and the next morning it needs a little pick me up, I smooth this through and it brings back my waves and my shine. It's not sticky, stiff or heavy. It doesn't change over time and in fact it only gets better with time. It just leaves my hair shiny, soft and silky. I absolutely LOVE this product!!!!!"

I bought this during the Vib sale after I realized I loved the Crown Affair comb and wanted to try more products from this brand. I have stopped blow drying my hair to make it more healthy and was looking for a leave in/detangler that didn’t weigh my hair down but still leaves it silky and smooth and most importantly without an oily build up. This product does all that and more. It’s amazing and I’ve gotten compliments at work that my hair looks silky (which isn’t the norm as it’s getting humid here). I only need a small amount (one pump) which I put in my hair after I wash and condition. Then I can comb out my hair with very little tangles or pulling which I’m very happy about. I hope they make a smaller travel size version of this product so I can take it on the go during summer travels."

			"review_text": "When it comes to hair, you name a product, I either have it or have tried it. Therefore, when this came out, I felt like I had to give it a try because of the really positive, not incentivized reviews. First thing I noticed: I REALLY DON'T LIKE THE SMELL. Before you get annoyed at me let me explain, I normally don't pick products based on the smell, and I am really not picky about smells either, I think this is the very first time that I am turned off by a product based on the smell of it (and let me tell you, I have tried them all!). It smells like a really strong man cologne, it doesn't necessarily smell bad, it's just really really masculine, which is not my cup of tea. But many people in the reviews said it smells good, so maybe it is just a me problem. Now let's talk about the product itself: it is a really light weight leave in, which is what I like as I use leave in conditioner pretty much every day and I don't wanna weigh down my hair too much, but I don't find anything special in it that justifies the higher price, other than the a really chic, luxurious packaging (that is nice but really does nothing to your hair). So to summarize: Smell is a no, product is oaky and packaging is a yes. I honestly don't know if I would recommend this product or not yet. This is still new and I think I need to try out a little bit more, I won't return it for that reason, but so far I am not in love and it did not seem to do anything extraordinary on my hair that justifies the price."

For years I have struggled with finding a product that doesn’t weigh my hair down or make it feel greasy/dirty. I have spent thousands on Oribe, Kerestase, It’s a 10, Redken, Amika with no luck. THIS IS THE PRODUCT!  I can put this on my hair, wet or dry and my hair absorbs it beautifully. It makes my hair look and feel more moisturized and doesn’t look greasy at all. I’m honestly in disbelief that it works so well. When using this after a shower, I put it on my entire lengths and then apply Shu Uemura oil on the ends to lock in the moisture. I used to use It’s a 10 leave-in for years and this combo knocks it out of the park. If you have lots of fine hair - try this!!! You won’t be disappointed."

Full and beautiful, suddenly it started breaking off!!! I’m so sad. Tried many products with more breakage and issues. This was love at first use. Made my fine hair look full and not weighed down, looked good for like 3 days! I’m scared of the dimethicone in this product, most of the products in this line have it. If I had short hair that I cut a lot I wouldn’t worry as much about it. I’m trying to protect and grown back the fullness in my 28” long hair. Sadly I returned, I would have kept using if not for the silicones in it. Maybe I am misinformed about silicones but from what I read dimethicone is one of the ones that will create a cast and build up on the hair. What good is it to wash it off if you will just coat it once again with non water soluble silicone. I wish someone could help me with these hair issues! I’m so tired of trying products only to have more broken hair. I did like this product line the best of all the ones I tried. I didn’t see as much breakage, just worried about long term effects as I said. I have a feeling the previous product I used successfully for five years,  which  has amodimethicone, may have created a cast over my hair and caused it to now break off. Hence my fear of any silicones."

However, I took a chance on this one. As a product junkie, I've tried many many leave ins, and can honestly say this one blew most of the ones I've tried out of the water. The scent is hard to put a name to. It's not my favorite, but not unpleasant by any means. I have baby-fine, curly hair, a mixture of 2c,3a, and some 3b. I find it difficult to find products that don't weigh my hair down and also don't use coconut oil and shea butter, as my skin hates those. This was the perfect product for me. I use about 2-3 pumps for my whole head, and add a tiny bit more while styling my hair curly if it feels necessary. It plays well with others. I've used it with several different gels and foams, and had nice results every time. I love using it with curlsmiths new shine jelly or the dippity doo girls with curls mousse (or both). I can't peak to what it does for a blowout or straightening, as I avoid doing that to my hair."
