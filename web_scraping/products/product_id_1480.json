			"review_text": "Okay so I‚Äôve heard so much hype and good things about the Skylar body mists but knew I would never spend $40.50 CAD on a 80ml body mist. So when I saw that these were on sale on Black Friday I immediately bought this one and the boardwalk mist. This one was super underwhelming as it smells a little boring and basic. It‚Äôs nice but just not worth $40.50. The boardwalk is amazing and I would totally recommend as it smells more unique and special (if you‚Äôre looking for a more high end body mist) Both are still nice to layer with and the mist is super fine which I like, but I don‚Äôt think they‚Äôre worth $40.50, especially for the size."

This is a really nice and sweet gourmand fragrance due to the notes of Pure Vanilla, Cappuccino, and Caramelized Cedar mixed all together to make such an intoxicating scent that makes me think of fall. When I wear this fragrance, it makes me feel warm and cozy, like I'm wrapped up in a warm, snuggly blanket cuddled up on a cold night in front of the fireplace. It's the perfect fragrance to wear on a chilly day or evening when you want to feel cozy and comforted. The vanilla note in Skylar Vanilla Sky is not too sweet or overpowering. It's perfectly balanced by the cappuccino and caramelized cedar notes, which add a touch of sophistication and depth to the fragrance. Overall, I highly recommend Skylar Vanilla Sky to anyone who loves sweet, warm, and cozy fragrances. It's a perfect fragrance for fall and winter, but it can also be worn year-round."

Its a 2.7 fl oz bottle which is convenient enough to throw into the bag on the go. Unlike Coconut Cove, Vanilla Sky does not perform as long on my skin, but no headaches with this one. I get less than an hour of wear time before it becomes a skin scent. This body mist smells a lot like a milder warm vanilla sugar scent iykwim. Not the biggest fan of straight up vanilla scents, but I can see myself layering this with some of my favorite fall and winter scents like black opium. If you're looking for a warm vanilla scent, this is one to try! Side note, the first ingredient is organic sugar cane alcohol, idk if prolonged use in hair as hair mist will dry it out, so recommend to use mainly as body mist."
