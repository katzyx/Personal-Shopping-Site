			"review_text": "I bought this with my own money with a discount and rewards money which brought it down to $180.  honestly i think thats how much these attachment dryers are worth now that everyone has this tech.  I’ve had the Dyson in the past and prefer this model to that one. The curling barrels are longer (slightly skinnier) and easier to use. The paddle brush that comes with this one is a great size and achieves a nice volume and style with minimal effort.    Someone mentioned the power unit isn’t as strong which is true but despite this I’m still able to style in the same amount of time the Dyson took. I think less power - along with the ceramic coating - helps to minimize frizz and certainly means less heat on your neck as you’re styling so I appreciate that feature. My curls will last for 2-3 days but I think that’s more down to my hair type and not the tool.  Overall if you’re looking to buy an attachment dryer styler this is a great option. But wait for a good sale before you spend all that money!"

			"review_text": "I don’t normally leave reviews, but this needs to be said. The brush doesn’t work as well as my Revlon brush which I’ve had for +5 years. It takes longer to dry and goes frizzy quite fast. Unfortunately, I was travelling abroad while I was using my brush and I wasn’t able to apply for a 1 year warranty on T3 website. The problem is that I can’t switch out any other brush heads now that the attachment button is broken. It looks like the glue that attach the button into the main handle lost its adhesion fell out and is now in inoperable. I’m very disappointed because this brush was very expensive and I won’t be able to apply for the warranty or refund it through Sephora because of their return policy. The brush broke one day after the Sephora return period. I’d accept at least an exchange but the customer service does not permit this."

			"review_text": "I wanted to leave this review to help people who were trying to decide between this, the Shark Flexstyle and Dyson Airwap. I have owned the Shark, and used my friends Dyson multiple times.   Pros of T3: - slightly longer barrels  - chic design, colour and comes with easy to transport leather-look bag - easy to use (they all are really once you get the hang of the technique) - curls hold for a long time even with fine hair - smooth barrels minimise risk of frizz  Cons: - Dryer not has powerful as the Shark or Dyson  Overall I am really happy with my purchase and glad I sold my Shark to a friend! Whilst I liked the Shark, sometimes felt the very matte barrels could cause hair to frizz, however the Shark is a great price and has a powerful dryer which does not have to be removed which is a plus!  I can't comment on the brushes as I have fine hair, and find them too big to be of use to me."

I tried this styler on my wavy thin hair, my sister’s curly thin hair, and my mom’s curly thick hair. I’ve tried all of the attachments and my favorite one is the curling ones although the curls don’t last long they leave a cute look. The curls dropped in seconds of being curly. I played around with the settings trying to find the right one for each hair and to this day the curls don’t last. One last thing I could try is putting some hair spray or mousse to see if they last longer like the description states. The brush pulled my hair soo many times so make sure to not let your hair get to were the attachment connects because it will pull your hair. Overall I would definitely try something else from this brand to see if this was just a miss for me."

Even though I sprayed sections of hair with water mist before styling each curl, it still didn’t last! The curls come out beautiful right away, but by the time I finished everything just fell apart. As you can see in the photo that is like 5-10 min after styling my entire hair.

			"review_text": "I am beyond excited to share my latest hair tool obsession – the T3 Aire 360 Ceramic Air Styler Blowout Kit. This thing has been a total game-changer for my hair routine!  One of the first things I noticed and absolutely love is the carrying case. It’s got these handy pockets to keep all the pieces together and in place. For someone who tends to lose things easily (guilty!), this has been a lifesaver. Everything stays organized and ready to go whenever I need it.  Now, let’s talk about my hair – it’s very long, and finding a tool that can handle it without a fuss is always a challenge. But the extra-long barrel on this air styler is perfect for creating beautiful, voluminous curls. It’s designed to gather hair effortlessly with its Aire 360 Technology, and I’m seeing zero heat damage, which is a huge plus.  The ceramic curling attachments are another highlight. They pair with the advanced heat and airflow to smooth my hair, boost shine, and create those lasting blowout curls we all dream of. Plus, the T3 AireX motor delivers such powerful airflow that my hair dries super quickly, preserving its natural moisture.  One of my favorite attachments is the oval brush. The SmoothGrip bristles and CeraGloss™ ceramic surface lift, smooth, and add incredible shine to my hair without any breakage. And with three heat settings, three speed settings, and a cool shot to lock in my style, I can customize my blowout exactly how I like it.  Styling is a breeze with the 9ft, 360-degree swivel cord – no more tangling or twisting! This tool gives me salon-quality results at home, and I couldn’t be happier.  If you have long hair and want to achieve gorgeous, healthy curls with minimal effort, you need to try the T3 Aire 360."

The way the air travels through each attachment at just the right temperature to style effortlessly with minimal to no heat damage is honestly invaluable. I’ve particularly been enjoying the brush attachment for sleek blowouts and the curling attachments to give my style a soft wave and accentuate the layers in my hair. I have shoulder length hair at the moment but I can see getting even more benefit out of this tool as my hair grows out. Lastly, it goes without saying that the packaging and aesthetic is impeccable. I’m not sure anyone does it quite like T3 in that regard."

But since using the AIRE 360 Ceramic Air Styler Blowout Kit, styling has become effortless. It's user-friendly, requiring only one hand and is particularly easy if you're familiar with other hair tools. It makes me feel like a professional. My hair—and my scalp, for that matter—has never looked or felt better when styled by myself.  What's great about the AIRE 360 is its quick drying time. I can have dry, bouncy hair in under 15 minutes. If I'm taking more time to add curls, it might extend to 20-25 minutes. The curls it creates are beautiful and last long, even without hairspray. This tool has become a staple in my routine because I find it gentler on my hair and appreciate its versatility. I absolutely love this product and highly recommend it."

I have long, thick hair, so I appreciate the long curling barrels. I get tons of volume and big, bouncy curls. The only con for me is that the curls do not hold more than a day and my hair becomes more like a blowout look the next day (but still bouncy and voluminous). If you want a more structured curl look, this will not give it to you. I find that curling my hair when it is slightly damp and using the cool-shot feature really help with lasting power.

The curling attachments are super easy to use, and apart from dividing the hair into sections, they do most of the hard work.

I appreciate how the machine itself isn’t too loud or noisy making this very tolerable to hear while using.  The base is very comfortable to grip, and doesn’t irritate my arm throughout its use time. It’s an easy to control machine that allows me to do my entire head by myself.     I have a wavy and fine hair type that gets frizzy.   But I was able to get a salon finish blowout with lots of shine and body!   The drying concentrator helped take down my wet hair to a ‘moist enough and dried down level’ that perfectly prepped my hair for its amazing finish.  I love how the air felt and sound coming out of this attachment.   Then I styled my hair with the oval brush that has amazing bristles gently polishing and styling each section of my hair.  I used the highest heat setting when using the brush. I used the curling attachments to create curtain bangs.  Just be careful with not touching the barrels because of how hot the ceramic gets on the barrels itself.  I never experienced that kind of hot and almost sticky like feeling on a curling barrel before.   Make sure you use the tip for controlling that attachment.  Overall, I’m extremely pleased with my frizz free blowout.  I even love that someone on the streets assumed my hair was a wig.  I also can’t get over the detail work that went into the packaging to the vegan leather storage bag that’s  also compartmented."

The custom-designed oval brush with SmoothGrip bristles and a ceramic surface makes smoothing and shaping a breeze. I noticed a significant reduction in frizz and an increase in shine after using it. The SoftAire drying concentrator is another fantastic feature, as it dries my hair quickly while maintaining its natural moisture.  Using the Aire 360 base is incredibly easy, thanks to its smart microchip for digital heat control and high-speed AireX motor. It’s the fastest drying experience I've had, and the multiple heat and speed settings give me full control over my styling. The 9ft swivel cord is a thoughtful addition, allowing for easy maneuvering without any tangling.  Overall, the T3 Aire 360 Blow Out Kit is a fantastic investment for anyone who wants quick, easy, and gentle styling with stunning results."

This thing did my whole head of curls in 20 minutes. Mind that my hair was 90% dry when i started. i did have to mist water on my hair to get that crisp curl and bounciness if my hair was starting to dry too much before i got to the section. i am shocked and so impressed by this. i have A LOT of hair and this tool took my whole head from damp, frizz to shiny, bouncy curls. the curls lasted all day! i have curls even the next day somewhat. I AM SOLD ON THIS MIRACLE MACHINE!!!"

Like that the attachments come on and off so you can use multiple. The curl barrels are longer than other brands, which is great for my long hair. I like that this whole kit comes with a bag to store it in which is really convenient. Plus it’s super cute. It has a nice powdery pink finish to it and all the attachments. It has three different settings to fit your needs. It isn’t very loud like I was expecting it to be you know basically like a hairdryer. It has a lot of power. It’s convenient for doing your hair quickly."

This is my favorite new hair tool and I can't imagine styling my hair without it."

This is a hair tool with interchangeable attachments. It is a hairdryer, drying brush, and hair curler in one. It is very easy to change the attachments. The whole tool is lightweight and super easy to use. I also love the light pink color and a pouch that comes with it. The pouch has pockets for all attachments, so everything has its own place and doesn’t have at each other. All the tools I ease it to use, and I’m not too loud. The hairdryer and brush attachments work great, but I wasn’t completely satisfied with the curling ones. They are easy to use, but don’t seem to work great and my curls didn’t last at all. I felt that setting 2 was on the hotter side for my fine hair, But I probably needed an even hotter setting to make it work (I don’t want to put that much heat on my hair)"

They promise 0 heat damage The thing I didn’t like is: I have long hair on the thicker side and curling attachments didn’t do anything to my hair. The airflow seemed too weak and couldn’t curl my hair, even when I was trying to curl in thin layers."
