            "review_text": "I bought this with my own money with a discount and rewards money which brought it down to $180.  honestly i think thats how much these attachment dryers are worth now that everyone has this tech.  Iu2019ve had the Dyson in the past and prefer this model to that one. The curling barrels are longer (slightly skinnier) and easier to use. The paddle brush that comes with this one is a great size and achieves a nice volume and style with minimal effort.    Someone mentioned the power unit isnu2019t as strong which is true but despite this Iu2019m still able to style in the same amount of time the Dyson took. I think less power - along with the ceramic coating - helps to minimize frizz and certainly means less heat on your neck as youu2019re styling so I appreciate that feature. My curls will last for 2-3 days but I think thatu2019s more down to my hair type and not the tool.  Overall if youu2019re looking to buy an attachment dryer styler this is a great option. But wait for a good sale before you spend all that money!"

It takes longer to dry and goes frizzy quite fast. Unfortunately, I was travelling abroad while I was using my brush and I wasnu2019t able to apply for a 1 year warranty on T3 website. The problem is that I canu2019t switch out any other brush heads now that the attachment button is broken. It looks like the glue that attach the button into the main handle lost its adhesion fell out and is now in inoperable. Iu2019m very disappointed because this brush was very expensive and I wonu2019t be able to apply for the warranty or refund it through Sephora because of their return policy. The brush broke one day after the Sephora return period. Iu2019d accept at least an exchange but the customer service does not permit this."

I have owned the Shark, and used my friends Dyson multiple times.   Pros of T3: - slightly longer barrels  - chic design, colour and comes with easy to transport leather-look bag - easy to use (they all are really once you get the hang of the technique) - curls hold for a long time even with fine hair - smooth barrels minimise risk of frizz  Cons: - Dryer not has powerful as the Shark or Dyson  Overall I am really happy with my purchase and glad I sold my Shark to a friend! Whilst I liked the Shark, sometimes felt the very matte barrels could cause hair to frizz, however the Shark is a great price and has a powerful dryer which does not have to be removed which is a plus!  I can't comment on the brushes as I have fine hair, and find them too big to be of use to me."

Compared to competitors, the curling attachment is the worst. Pricey for what you get - a white labelled product."

I tried this styler on my wavy thin hair, my sisteru2019s curly thin hair, and my momu2019s curly thick hair. Iu2019ve tried all of the attachments and my favorite one is the curling ones although the curls donu2019t last long they leave a cute look. The curls dropped in seconds of being curly. I played around with the settings trying to find the right one for each hair and to this day the curls donu2019t last. One last thing I could try is putting some hair spray or mousse to see if they last longer like the description states. The brush pulled my hair soo many times so make sure to not let your hair get to were the attachment connects because it will pull your hair. Overall I would definitely try something else from this brand to see if this was just a miss for me."

Even though I sprayed sections of hair with water mist before styling each curl, it still didnu2019t last! The curls come out beautiful right away, but by the time I finished everything just fell apart. As you can see in the photo that is like 5-10 min after styling my entire hair.

The SmoothGrip bristles and CeraGlossu2122 ceramic surface lift, smooth, and add incredible shine to my hair without any breakage. And with three heat settings, three speed settings, and a cool shot to lock in my style, I can customize my blowout exactly how I like it.

I can have dry, bouncy hair in under 15 minutes. If I'm taking more time to add curls, it might extend to 20-25 minutes. The curls it creates are beautiful and last long, even without hairspray. This tool has become a staple in my routine because I find it gentler on my hair and appreciate its versatility. I absolutely love this product and highly recommend it."

My most used attachment is the drying concentrator, I notice my hair is way less frizzy and has more shine when using this to dry my hair vs a regular blow dryer. They really came through for us long haired girls with they curling attachments, they are longer and all my hair fits on the barrel effortlessly. I also love that the curling attachments are ceramic, using them to curl makes by beautiful curls so bouncy and voluminous, I looked like I just stepped out of the salon. T3 really thought of everything with this launch, they even included a chic bag (with pockets) to store everything in! This tool will be in my normal rotation now as I feel that itu2019s more gentle on my hair and love its versatility!"

The round brush attachment also does a great job lifting the roots. The travel bag is so lux and convenient with the pockets inside for storage. My only minor complaint is a few strands of your hair can get stuck where the brush head and t3 meet, so be careful."

Each attachment securely connects to the tool, making it feel like a single unit. The drying attachment has a unique shape, and it takes only about five minutes to go from soaking wet hair to damp hair ready for styling. The large oval brush takes my hair from damp and frizzy to dry and sleek in just a few passes. The short bristles gently grasp the hair, stretching curls while blowing it out. The curling attachments are super easy to use, and apart from dividing the hair into sections, they do most of the hard work.   Despite its power, the T3 Aire 360 is very quiet and doesn't produce any high-pitched whistling noises like some other styling tools or hair dryers. Blowing out my hair has always been a time-consuming task, but with the T3 Aire 360, it takes me no longer than 30 minutes to achieve a salon-quality blowout."

The base is very comfortable to grip, and doesnu2019t irritate my arm throughout its use time. Itu2019s an easy to control machine that allows me to do my entire head by myself.

The drying concentrator helped take down my wet hair to a u2018moist enough and dried down levelu2019 that perfectly prepped my hair for its amazing finish.  I love how the air felt and sound coming out of this attachment.   Then I styled my hair with the oval brush that has amazing bristles gently polishing and styling each section of my hair.  I used the highest heat setting when using the brush. I used the curling attachments to create curtain bangs.  Just be careful with not touching the barrels because of how hot the ceramic gets on the barrels itself.  I never experienced that kind of hot and almost sticky like feeling on a curling barrel before.   Make sure you use the tip for controlling that attachment.  Overall, Iu2019m extremely pleased with my frizz free blowout.  I even love that someone on the streets assumed my hair was a wig.

This thing did my whole head of curls in 20 minutes. Mind that my hair was 90% dry when i started. i did have to mist water on my hair to get that crisp curl and bounciness if my hair was starting to dry too much before i got to the section. i am shocked and so impressed by this. i have A LOT of hair and this tool took my whole head from damp, frizz to shiny, bouncy curls. the curls lasted all day! i have curls even the next day somewhat.

This is a hair tool with interchangeable attachments. It is a hairdryer, drying brush, and hair curler in one. It is very easy to change the attachments. The whole tool is lightweight and super easy to use. I also love the light pink color and a pouch that comes with it. The pouch has pockets for all attachments, so everything has its own place and doesnu2019t have at each other. All the tools I ease it to use, and Iu2019m not too loud. The hairdryer and brush attachments work great, but I wasnu2019t completely satisfied with the curling ones. They are easy to use, but donu2019t seem to work great and my curls didnu2019t last at all. I felt that setting 2 was on the hotter side for my fine hair, But I probably needed an even hotter setting to make it work (I donu2019t want to put that much heat on my hair)"

The color of the Aire 360 and its ceramic attachments are gorgeous. Attachments are super eazy to change and use. Very ergonomic. 3. They promise 0 heat damage The thing I didnu2019t like is: I have long hair on the thicker side and curling attachments didnu2019t do anything to my hair. The airflow seemed too weak and couldnu2019t curl my hair, even when I was trying to curl in thin layers."
