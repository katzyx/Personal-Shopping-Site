One plus point though is that the scent really lasts a long time and doesn’t vanish quickly.   I made a friend try it and she loved it so it might just be me who isn’t a fan"

Described as having the following notes: Neroli, Bitter Orange, Raspberry, Orange Flower Absolute, Sambac Jasmine Absolute, Gardenia, Patchouli, Honey, Amber. I would say the smell is bitter, Gardenia and the Amber stand out but mostly it smells like an old dark woodsy musky scent. Other reviewers mentioned it was long lasting but i found the scent would fade away after 4 hours or so. Unfortuntely I'm not a fan and wouldn't recommend it. I love the idea of the shape being inspired by the regent diamond in the louvre, but it isn't very practical and is awkward to hold."

It could easily be worn on a daily basis and doesn't feel the need to have a special occasion in order to wear it. I don't have a strong nose for all the levels of fragrance that this perfume has, but I can appreciate that there is some depth to the smell. The notes are well balanced. The only thing I can't speak to is the lasting power. I'm a teacher and can't wear perfume to work so I haven't been able to give it a satisfactory wear test. I do love the packaging of this perfume and kind of enjoy the way it lays on the shelf."

			"review_text": "Like all Paco Rabanne fragrances, Lady Million is very luxurious, from the packaging to the scent itself. I found this fragrance to be very neroli-forward (at least on me). This gives it a very mature smell in my opinion so it's not typically a scent I would go for. However, the intensity of this fragrance really allows for it to fade into a much sweeter scent by the end of the day so I will usually apply a very light layer to my chest and wrists right out of the shower. This is definitely more of a fall/winter scent. It's warm and inviting and seductive. Layering it with a fruitier scent would make it more wearable for the summer/daytime."

The perfume starts out quite strong but don’t worry it mellows out into a soft playful scent that can work throughout the day or a light subtle fragrance for the evening. Love the packaging but not a perfume you’d take with you on the go. I feel like this scent would suit anyone who wears it and would adapt to the under-notes of your natural scent, my mother tried it and it smelt more woodsy on her however it smelt more fresh and floral on me. Would definitely recommend anyone try this."

The bottle is beautiful and its scent is the perfect mix of sweet, fresh and floral for everyday wear. With nodes of patchouli, honey and gardenia it’s very easy to layer with any other vanilla or sweet scent! Personally, I love pairing with vanilla and rose lotions.  I’ve worn this scent to school, to work and at social outings and receive lots of compliments. I would definitely wear it again!!

			"review_text": "Un merveilleux parfum floral fruité Déjà une grande amatrice des parfums Paco Rabanne, je suis totalement sous le charme de ce nouveau parfum Lady Million qui est une petite pépite avec cette accord fruité et floral qui est parfaitement adapté à la saison printanière.  Un parfum très féminin et sensuel qui met en confiance.  J'aime énormément les notes de grenade et mandarine en note de tête et cette note de fond de musc qui se mélange à la perfection avec ce bouquet floral.  Sa tenue est super, il tient toute une journée sans perdre son intensité et j'aime beaucoup le sillage qu'il laisse derrière lui.  Mes amies ont énormément aimé mon nouveau parfum , je n'ai que des compliments.  Pour finir, toujours un packaging chic et magnifique avec ce gros diamant.  Je recommande absolument cette nouveauté si vous aimez les florales fruités, c'est mon nouveau chouchou pour les beaux jours."

Although it smells floral, it’s hard to place any individual scents. It doesn’t smell overpowering though - it’s not the kind of scent that would make me sneeze if someone walked by with it on.   Personally, I would prefer if they made one note stand out a bit more. Preferably, a specific flower.   I’m also not the biggest fan of the packaging. It looks a bit tacky with all the gold and the odd shape."

My first impression was that it might be unisex because it has a masculine, woody scent. Which makes it mystical and interesant. It is a strong, long lasting smell on its own but not bothering, which i loved.  I feel like it is a perfum to be used in special ocassions only, because for everyday use it would be too 'provocative/seductive' and it would lose its mystery.  It is a scent that turns heads, exactly because you can not smell it everywhere.  They used the description flirty, I think it is more like a serious, grown and intoxicating smell not a fruity or playful one."

Upon first glance, I felt drawn toward the bottle as its unique in design and very eye catching.  Dazzling.  The amber/ gold hue speaks royalty without being tacky.  The in packaging was my favourite part as it’s so sleek and is wrapped up like the perfect gift.   The scent is seductive, fixed with light florals but fresh.  It is a bit of a mature scent and not something that I would normally purchase, but I found that the scent was appealing.  (I am in my thirties and think someone in their fifties would wear this normally ). I I wish it lasted longer, that’s why I’m giving this only a four star review and not five.  Reapplication is needed throughout the day.   Overall I think this would make a great gift for someone who is mature, yet bold and knows what they want.  The scent is empowering and displays confidence, while being delicate at the same time.  True femininity.    After receiving the product, I researched the designer a bit and found out some information that I didn’t know.  Paco collaborated with a range of iconic fashion houses and designed costumes for films. Rabanne was also the recipient of several awards, including the Legion of Honour, which recognised his contributions to the arts and fashion. He was iconic and broke out in the 1960s and made his debut of fashion and world renowned fragrances.  Simply iconic.  Happy to have received this gift.   Thank you."

The perfume kind of keeps me wanting more! I’ll definitely be using this a lot for the next few months. If I had to describe the scent, i’d say its a sweetish floral and perfect for people who gravitate towards Chanel or Dior or specifically for me, I think this gives off the same mature girlie vibe as Jo Malone - Rose and Peony which is also kind of on the strong side. So for those who like a more subtle scent, this prrfume may not be for you. This scent lasted a full day for me however it did slowly start to get weaker at the 4-6 hour mark, but it is definitely longer lasting than most!

The scent comes off delicate but a tad overwhelming in the first few minutes however it does end up settling in and becomes more subtle. I personally wouldn’t say that it fades as you shouldn’t have to reapply this throughout the day but it becomes less overwhelming and a much more enjoyable scent. The bottle feels and looks nice and unique which could definitely be a statement piece in someone collection.  Overall I enjoyed the scent after a while, definitely think it could be someone’s daily scent, but depending on how many sprays you use it could be overwhelming. I would purchase this after my experience wearing."

			"review_text": "I received this product for free in exchange for my honest review. With this perfume, don’t write it off at first smell, see how it develops overtime before writing it off. When I first sprayed it, the sweet honey and orange blossom was a bit overpowering for my taste and I was worried that it would be too sweet. Honestly, I didn’t like it during the initial spray, but once it settled and developed with my body chemistry, I’ve come to like it much more. It’s fresh, floral, feminine, clean, and warm. The honey is the main sweet note at first, but over time I was able to smell the hints of raspberry and lemon. The patchouli really rounds it out to give off a more mature vibe.   The perfume lasts quite long on me (8-10 hours) with a good projection and without being too overpowering. The one thing that I don’t like is the packaging. The lightweight material they use for the top of the bottle ruins the experience and classiness of the bottle in my opinion. I wish it was a heavier material, like the bottom. The perfume also doesn’t sit upright, but that’s not a huge issue for me.  It’s not a groundbreaking fragrance, but it’s one that is timeless and won’t go out of style. If you love white florals and clean musk, this is a good bet. Overall, I’ve really enjoyed this fragrance! It will definitely be in my rotation for nights out and as the weather gets colder."

However it does last longer when sprayed directly onto clothing. I am aware that skin ph plays a role in how long a perfume will last so I didn’t mark any stars off for that."
