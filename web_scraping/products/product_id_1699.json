I love the light scent of fresh citrus. I have natural curly hair, but it's good for all hair types. It can be used on damp or dry hair, I personally use it on dry hair after I diffuse. After I put most of my products in my hair, I will diffuse. I then pump just a small amount of this oil into my palm, then gently rub my curls with it to kinda break up my curls. I really like the shine this leaves in my hair and helps the frizz and fly aways. I will definitely continue to use this and will also continue to recommend it."

Too much smell, too much oiliness, too much icky getting on everything? Ghost Oil seems to have fixed all those problems! I honestly didn't think it was possible for an oil to be not too oily.  The smell is light and fades completely so as not to overpower anything else you are wearing. There is no oily icky feeling on the back of your neck, no worries about getting it on your clothes, etc. And more importantly it is not toooo oily feeling that it makes things too slick or scalp greasy. I honestly can't figure out how they did it! It is a hair oil that accomplishes everything you want a hair oil to do, without being icky!!! Maybe that's why it is called Ghost? because it is there, it is working, but you are not overly aware of it!"

The good news is that I regularly use hair oil and have been wanting to try this for a while after falling in love with their dry shampoo. Anyway, I have been using this for several weeks now and really enjoy putting some in my hair almost every day. I use one pump in my hands, rub them together and then lightly apply to my hair from about the mid lengths down to the ends. I'll sometimes give a little extra product to the ends to help them not feel so crispy. This has felt great in my hair and not weighed it down.  My hair looks smoother and feels so much softer after using. I definately recommend giving this a try if you've been thinking about it."

This was my first time using this product and I waited a couple weeks before writing this review and I used it both on wet and dry hair. I found this product did stay weightless on my fine hair and as long as I stayed away from my roots it added shine and didn't give a greasy look. For me this oil worked the best for my ends that tend to look dry, dull, frizzy, and full of split ends. This product really helped to smooth my ends out and provide a healthy shine. As far as using it on wet or dry hair, either works fine. It looks really nice putting it on after styling on dry hair, but I found on my ends it provided the most benefit when I put it on damp. I like the scent it has because it's light and not overwhelming. Just a soft floral like smell. I think this limited edition provides a good value."

I have dry hair that's prone to frizziness and dullness, and I've heard good things about Verb, so I was really looking forward to trying this hair oil! It smells nice, and the consistency is a little thicker than other hair oils. However, I felt like it didn't feel thick in my hair as long as I used it in moderation. Unfortunately, I didn't see much of a difference after using the hair oil. I actually tried applying it to just one half of my hair to compare, and when I asked others which side looked better (without specifying which had the oil applied to it), they all chose the side that I hadn't put any in! Sadly, it just didn't seem to work for me."

I start by using one pump on my damp hair before blowdrying and I've noticed I don't need to use a straightener or curling iron on my wavy hair to control it now. My hair blow dries beautifully into its own natural form and I use another pump on dried hair to tame flyaways. I'm having great hair days EVERYDAY now! My hair has been so smooth and shiny, people are asking what I've done differently. I color my hair and this oil makes it look freshly colored day after day. The oil is so weightless, like nothing is in my hair. I can even use it near my part to keep those flyaways in check and it doesn't make me look oily, even having a naturally oily scalp. My hair stays so soft all day too. I made my sister try some on her insanely thick, curly hair and she was amazed at how easy it made brushing her hair. When her hair air dried, she had the most beautiful curls I've ever seen on her and she purchased her own immediately. Other brands claim weightless shine, but Verb Ghost Oil delivers. This is the end all, be all for hair products. Everyone should own this. My sister and I have wildly different hair, mine is fine, short and wavy and hers is very thick, long and curly. I color my hair, she doesn't and yet we have the same great things to say about this hair oil. At such an affordable price and with instant results, there is no reason to wonder. Just buy it!!"

Most of the oils I've tried have been too heavy, didn't seem to penetrate my hair, or did nothing for the style. I generally use this after a shower as a moisturizer/ defrizz product but have also used it while traveling to refresh hair, bring my curls back from frizzy nightmare to sleek curls. The thing I love most is it's so light, I can't feel it and my hair just feels soft to the touch. Honestly, I have been using it for a year now and it is basically a staple in my regular hair routine. I have 3c curls on a good day, my hair is on the thinner side due to damage for reference. My only gripe is I wish the bottle was bigger, I go through it in about a month or so depending on my travel schedule."

The scent is pleasant and light, others can be overpowering and/or linger for too long. I have no cons, I highly recommend this!"

MY HAIR IS SOOOOOOO SOFT AND SMOOTH once it dries! AMAZING! just amazing! in addition hair products usually leaves a heavy film or some kind of left over residue. NOT THIS PRODUCT! my hair is weightless soft and smooth like skin on a new baby! I towel dry my hair. I never use a hair dryer so my experience is based on these steps .I towel dry my hair straight out of the shower. I squeeze a few pumps into the palm of my hand while I bend forward with my long hair hanging downward I press the product between the palms of my hands then I gather hair into the palms of my hands crunching at the ends and then I spread the product all over my hair in between my palms. I work my way to my roots and I rub the rest of the product on top of my head. then I brush/comb my hair to make sure the product is fully spread throughout my hair. I then throw my hair in a bun. when my hair is finally dry I am just baffled at how soft and smooth my hair is! it's literally softer then a little puppy with soft puppy fur!!! I'm just kind of bummed that I'm nearly out of my samples and will have to pay $20!for the same size bottles I got free! it's ok tho. it's well worth it!"

I started to think maybe I was using it wrong. In the beginning, I was using it when my hair was completely frizzy and totally dry. It didn't work at all then. So, this time I had some frizz and dryness but It wasn't totally out of control. I put some of the oil on my hair and it instantly got rid of the frizz I had, and it made my hair extremely shining. Shining like just coming from the beauty salon shiny. I just bought the Verb shampoo and conditioner. I can't wait to use them. I never write reviews but this product is just so wonderful.

It doesn't make my fine and thin hair greasy or oily. I can't believe it! It's literally a GHOST oil! My hair is naturally curly and high porosity. I find it great for taming any frizz, nourishing and smoothing hair strands.  I love using it as the final step on my wash day after my hair dries to seal all the moisture in. I also use it on non-wash days. It makes my hair look refreshed again. Don't expect it to fix a very bad hair day or fix very frizzy hair though because that's not an oil's job. I apply it all over my hair and sometimes spot treat any troubled areas. I like to focus on my the ends when applying to prevent any split ends from forming. It does help make my dry ends feel smoother. I'm a big fan of the silicones and protien in this product because they help retain moisture in the hair strands. The texture isn't like that of a typical oil but rather a serum like texture which I prefer becase it's less messy. The pump packaging makes it easy to use too. My hands don't get greasy after using it. Just a slight oily feeling that disappears so quickly and doesn't bother me which is amazing. I also love how it smells. It's a light fresh scent which makes me enjoy the product even more. It's vegan and cruelty free, which is why I was able to buy it. So satisfied. I look forward to doing my hair routine because of this product. It was recommended by my favorite curly hair influencer. I was hesitant at first but so glad that I finally took the plunge and now I get the hype! Applying an oil with a lovely fresh scent that nourishes and tames my hair really makes me happy. I find it a little expensive for me but it's my guilty pleasure and will definitely repurchase!"

On top of that, I am seriously hopeless with styling like I am actually famous for my topknot because I never learned what else to do with hair. This hair oil just changed the trajectory of my entire life. Got this as part of the holiday shampoo/conditioner set cause I needed shampoo and conditioner. Had zero expectations for this and didn’t know how to use. I had a special event tonight and I usually go to salons to get a blowout but didn’t have time so I legit just read the directions and rubbed this on my head and ran out the door. I guess it took 10 minutes or so to settle in cause after that, I LOOKED LIKE I GOT ONE OF MY TYPICAL $50 BLOWOUTS. I AM NEVER GOING TO THE SALON AGAIN. My crown is totally frizz-free in a perfect gen z-approved middle part (I am def older) and my waves are to die for, if I may say so myself. And it’s so light!

I also got my mother to use this oil too. It's more of a serum than oil but I love how nourished the ends of my hair feel. Sometimes you can get the full-sized bottle with those holiday bundles so if you have been wanting to try verb products, that would be a good start. I enjoy the Ghost line from them, and it works for my straight, thin hair."

It leaves my hair so soft, silky and shiny without feeling greasy or weighed down. It also has a very light scent which is great for those who don’t like a lot of fragrance. The instructions say to use 2-3 pumps but honestly with the amount of product that comes out you actually really need like a half a pump. A little seriously goes a long way with this product and it can be very easy to accidentally put on too much. I have thick hair and if you have the same I really think this product is for you too!"

And yes, I know to not use too much, but when you have lighter hair, it is so difficult to apply oil to the ends or drier parts of your hair without having it be too much. Even a little of some oils show up! This hair oil by Verb is fabulous. I can apply it to my ends and smooth over my whole head to smooth out frizzies and fly away strands and my hair looks healthy and shiny, not greasy at all. It just absorbs and disappears and leaves your hair looking smooth and healthy. No annoying fragrance, no greasy hair, no one has to know you use it at all. It earns its name, Ghost Oil...they'll never know it's there, but your hair will love it!"

But with those things said, I'm impressed.  My hair is wavy, on the thinner side, prone to breakage, longer than shoulder length and this works wonders to add some shine without making my hair dull or otherwise greasy.  I used the K-Pak serum by Joico for many years which is supposed to add shine & protect from heat damage.  Verb's ghost oil works far better, plus it doesn't seem to create tons of product buildup on the hair at all.  I don't have to clarify my hair as much or aggressively shampoo it every week, so overall, my hair is much softer and experiencing far less damage, even if this product doesn't protect against heat.  It's my belief that anything that coats the strands will offer some protection.  I have lots of baby hairs around my hair line and this product keeps them in check, making it super simple to get my hair sleek and in line with a low-heat infrared flat iron.  Definitely recommend!  I live in a dry climate and this product has changed my hair for the better."

I am not the biggest fan of the smell although I don’t hate it, but when the smell is mixed with the lovely smell of my shampoo and conditioner it’s actually quite nice although artificial. I have fine, straight and somewhat thin hair so not sure if this would work as well for very thick, textured or curly hair.

The small 17ml bottle lasted me 6 months, even though I have plenty of hip length hair that is naturally curly in texture, however the strands themselves are somewhere between fine and thick, so medium size strands? Any how, i would use this oil after every shower, separating the hair into two sections and applying the ghost oil to the lengths, beginning from the ears down, and with any left over on my hands would smooth the light frizz at the roots, however I’ve never really applied the oil to the roots. With the trial size lasting 6 months, I saw a dramatic improvement, my hair would always feels super soft and virtually frizz free every time I used it, and it was noticeable when I skipped the oil step. I ended up finishing up the oil approximately two weeks before I ordered the full size. Those two weeks without the oil, my hair tangled more easy, my ends felt dry, and my hair was no longer as soft feeling and I was experiencing more frizz. While I wish the bottle was bigger in size, I can say this product is worth the $20CA, and will continue to use the ghost oil after every shower until I find something even better, which for the price of this product I doubt I will find a replacement anytime soon. A definite 5/5 for me, even though I wish the bottle was bigger for the price, seeing as how I’m a gal on a budget, but for nice feeling hair I can’t complain, especially since I haven’t had a haircut since before the 2020 pandemic began in March of last year. Also love the pump on this product, however not the biggest fan of the sent, which I’m happy doesn’t stick around for long and usually have to smell the oil itself just to get a whiff of it. Still 5/5"

I work it from about ear to ends (wet hair) and then i use whatever is leftover on my hands and apply it to my scalp (i know, shocking!! Rule number one with thin hair, don’t apply anything to your scalp unless you want to look an oily mess). Then i will dry and style as usual. It gets rid of all my frizz and is long lasting - I’ve always had an issue with my hair looking nice and frizz free with other products, but then will sleep on it and wake up with frizz. Not with this product. It keeps my hair sleek, shiny and light without it looking oily or heavy.

What is unique about this product is i can even put this on my roots and it won’t make my hair greasy which is unheard of for fine hair!! I have to start with a dime sized amount distributed through the ends and use whatever is left gently patting my roots and any breakage and flyaways are gone! It really is a miracle product and using a dime size product makes it last a really long time so it is worth every penny there is nothing else i will use. The added shine is also a nice bonus. This will only make your hair greasy if you use too much or your hair is the type that gets greasy 3 hours after washing or something. Definitely buy it and maybe find your own specific routine with this it’s definitely worth the smooth factor.

I have used a full pump in my hair for a couple days now and I am super pleased with this product. While I don’t think this product alone is a miracle product and I can understand why some people might feel like this has dont nothing for them, I feel with the right haircare this definitely helps my hair look healthily shiny and soft to the touch. Totally worth the price in my opinion and I will likely be buying another bottle in the future, whenever this new one runs out. It should last me a bit though, which is another plus in my book."

The same thing happened to my hair when I triedBed head shampoo and conditioner I really loved it at first and then all of a sudden increase breakage. I assume from the silicone buildup not letting actual moisture penetrate into the hair. Pay attention really check your hair in good light after a couple weeks of use.  I can’t believe I did it again sample only listed mornings oil. If I had known it was mostly silicones I would’ve passed. Took months to recover from the bed head products.

The smell was faint lemon, I used about 1- pumps and applied to towel dried hair before applying mousse. I only applied it to the ends. This caused my hair to be really flat and would not hold a curl to save its life. My hair was also still frizzy. I’m taking this back today.

You don’t have to use much (depends on the length of your hair)for it to do the job. I have shoulder length hair and use a dime to a nickel size each application and it’s great. It’s a bit of a learning curve to find just the right amount for your hair. Doesn’t weigh your hair down either.  I’ve tried many oil styling products and this is the best I’ve found. I apply with my head upside down then from the crown to the front for even application. I will definitely purchase again."

Then adding a tiny tiny bit to the crown helps eliminate any pesky flyaways and adds nice shine."

I got a tiny sample from a past order and knew immediately I had to buy the full bottle. I usually buy cheap hair oils from Walmart but I can never ever go back now. I am born and raised in super humid Florida, almost 30 yrs old with long color treated blonde hair, and have struggled to keep my hair not frizzy and smooth my whole life. I usually straighten my hair but once I step outside for a bit, I have tiny frizzy baby hairs or fly aways and my hair is more course feeling and starting to get wavy. It's always wrecked after sleeping on it. But this oil... I can't even believe it. I put a pump throughout towel dried hair post shower, brush my hair, dry it however and straighten it, and it's a night and day difference. it's shiny, soft, straight and flowy. After sweating outside all day it NEVER frizzes and my baby hairs stay straight to my head. It looks literally just as good for DAYS after sleeping on it with just a bit of dry shampoo. I'm hooked for life!!!"

Review:  This product is absolutely amazing when used with the Leave-In Mist and Ghost Prep. I had virgin/non-colored hair prior to my balayage and even with color, my hair would always tangle and become frizzy in Idaho's dry environment. Not with this combo however! My hair doesn't tangle near as much and my flyaways have been smoothed out. I rarely blow-dry/heat-style my hair so even after air-drying, my hair looks like I still straightened it. I can't speak using the product by itself though, because I feel like I need to use it in conjunction with the other products for my type of hair."

I decided to step out of my comfort zone and got this my hair was soft but it was still frizzy after using this. The smell is light and clean like their shampoo from the line if you want a good hair oil I wouldn't be buying this. I did a side by side half my hair with ghost oil and the other my ogx oil. And the ogx took my frizz away made my wavy's look amazing and the ghost oil looked like nothing happened. But if you just want something that makes your hair somewhat soft be my guest and get this.

The down side is, the next day all that product weighs down the style.

Using one pump of this stuff on the bottom half of damp hair after a shower leaves my hair SO soft. It makes combing out my wet hair easier, makes my hair feeling amazing after a blow-dry, and does not weigh down my hair in the slightest. At this price, this product is a steal!"

It does nothing for my thick dry course wavey hair.  It gives me synthetic looking wig hair.  If that's what you're into then it's GREAT.  On the plus side, it didn't irritate my scalp or skin around the hairline.  Cream based products are much better at frizz fighting as well as styling."

			"review_text": "I personally like this hair oil. I have textured swavy hair that I've recently started to embrace after a lifetime of brushing it out straight. But my hair gets VERY frizzy when I wear it naturally unless I use a hair gel. I use this hair oil to scrunch out the gel cast or to tame frizz on non-wash days. It's super lightweight which is great for me as products can easily weigh my hair down.  Now I am not a strict follower of the CG method, but if you are you won't want to use this product. It does contain non-water soluble silicones which can only be removed with sulfates. So really anyone that strictly follows a no-sulfate hair care routine should stay away from this because silicones will build up on your hair and cause problems over time.  Having said that, I like the way silicones make my hair feel. Silicones not only make your hair feel soft and smooth, but they act as a fantastic thermal protectant. So if you are going to heat style your hair, silicones will protect your hair from damage. But in a way that makes this Ghost Oil kind of a fake product, because it's not the oils in this that make your hair feel good, it's likely the abundance of silicones that are. I don't believe that this product is in any way good for your hair, but it does make it feel nice and serve as an excellent heat protectant.   But this is the reason I'm giving this product 4 stars instead of 5, because the ingredients really aren't great. So use this sparingly and with discretion. If using this daily, I would definitely recommend a weekly clarifying wash with a sulfate shampoo. But in general I recommend a sulfate wash the same week you use this oil, or any products with silicone. It's the ONLY way to remove silicones."

When silicons are used in hair products it acts as a seal, coating your hair so that it becomes smooth and soft. But that coating is a barrier for any other conditioner or product to get into the strand. This product will work great if it's the only treatment you're using for you're hair besides a sulfate shampoo and conditioner. Sulfate breaks down silicone making you're hair able to absorb hair healing products. And always make sure to have wet/damp hair when applying them."

A little actually does go along way, so you can use a light hand while spritzing. Also the formula does  a great job of not becoming greasy and instead highlights an overall  freshness and healthiness. This is one of the best products I have found in terms of a hair oil and I plan on purchasing this item again when the bottle is done. Also, used responsibly this amount should last a good amount of time even if used daily. Several months of hair goodness all in this relatively inexpensive bottle. Also, the packaging is a  lovely minimalist aesthetic that I was immediately impressed by as well. Highly, highly recommended! For all hair types!"

It’s very neutral.   Overall: Definitely a new favorite in hair oils. I have pretty dry hair and it really adds weightless shine and smoothness [attaching an awkward photo, but it demonstrates the effect well, lol]."

			"review_text": "OK, first of all, WOW. This product is amazing. I have very fine, fragile, straight hair, which I’ve recently put through 6 rounds of lightening. And before that, I had box-dyed my hair a variety of dark colors — including blue-black — for years. I’m talking box dye over top of box dye over top of box dye. So lightening it was difficult, and my hair suffered quite a bit. It was so crunchy, dry, and tangle-prone. I tried a bunch of hair masks, leave-in treatments, deep conditioners, and all of the coconut, argan, avocado, and sweet almond oils my hair could hold. But nothing was able to make my hair feel soft again. I decided to try this because of the reviews and the low price, and I am so so glad I did. I couldn’t believe how soft my hair felt after the first use. I can actually run my fingers through my hair without them getting caught. And considering how much breakage I cause when I detangle my hair, this has really been a savior for my hair. I put a full pump in my hair after towel-drying, and on days when I’m not washing my hair, I’ll put just a few drops in to freshen it up. It is AMAZING how lightweight it is. It doesn’t weigh my hair down in the slightest. I do recommend (if your hair is dry and porous like mine) to use other hydrating products, because I feel like this product doesn’t really hydrate my hair a whole lot, but instead sort of locks in moisture that would otherwise just evaporate right out of my porous hair. I like using Redken’s All Soft Mega Hydramelt then following it up with this ghost oil. Without the hydrating step beforehand, my hair does feel soft, but somehow still looks dry (a combo I didn’t even know was possible). But if I use the hydramelt without using the ghost oil, my hair just isn’t as soft/shiny and definitely doesn’t stay hydrated nearly as long. I can’t imagine that I’ll ever stop using this product, because it has changed my hair game."

I don't see much of a difference between this product and the drugstore ones. It does do a tiny bit better at absorbing it into my hair but provides the same amount of moisture and de-frizzing. It is a nice beginner hair oil product but definitely not a holy grail or must have. I would recommend a drugstore brand over this one. It's a not a repurchase product for me."

Leaves it shiny and soft without being greasy. And actually, on days when my hair is greasy and I use dry shampoo, this little miracle saves my ends from looking parched. And at $16, it’s more than drug store products, sure; BUT I have tried high end everything and nothing even comes close to this. So it’s really a bargain. I have never been happier to have made a hair oil purchase."

I've been using it approximately 3 times per week for 2 months and I'm about 1/5th through the bottle. For my usage, it's fairly affordable. As others have mentioned, the main ingredients are not oils, they are non water soluble silicones which can build up in your hair. I haven't found this to be an issue, but others might want to be aware of that. I'll probably repurchase when the bottle is empty, but I don't feel like it's a product that I absolutely can't live without."

I have very thin, fine hair that gets greasy very quickly (I have to wash every other day or it’s a disaster). For that reason, I’m also very hesitant to use many products as I feel like they generally just make my hair look greasier, and I was especially hesitant to use an oil. But I bit the bullet and tried this oil, and I will never look back. It doesn’t make my hair greasy at all (to be fair, I don’t use it on my roots, just in case), and it makes it bouncy, shiny and incredibly healthy looking. It doesn’t weight my hair down at all. This is a truly fantastic product and I can’t believe it took me this long to try it."

I have been using Verb's Ghost Oil combined with Verb's Ghost Prep for 2.5 years now. After showering, I mix the two products in my hand before coating my hair with it (usually about 6 pumps of Ghost Oil, and a nickel-sized amount of the Ghost Prep - don't judge, I have long and curly hair), and styling as needed (I usually make sure that my curls are evenly coated and then air-dry).   My hair is left manageable and soft until my next wash (I wash my hair on alternating days), even during our long Canadian winters.  I run through 1 bottle of Ghost Oil over the course of about 2 months, but so far, for the cost and the quality of product, I am happy to keep purchasing!"

When there’s BARELY anything left on my palms, I’ll smooth my hands from the top of my head to my ends just to hit any flyaways. It leaves my hair soo soft and shiny! I use it before I blow dry (which happens rarely) for added heat protection.  But it’s even great for air drying or even to apply after hair is totally dry. Used every other day when I wash (and with the appropriate amount), it really does improve hair texture and health over time. Plus, I never have an issue with greasiness even in between washings (less is more with this stuff). Use with a boar hair brush for optimal results. Side notes: it lasts a looong time (unless you’re putting way too much of it in your hair). It has a nice, light lemongrass scent that doesn’t linger - a bonus for those who are sensitive to strong scents."

I use it after I wash my hair, I put one pump in my hands (warm it up) and then disperse through my hair. It has really gotten rid of the frizz. I do not put it on or near my roots, so added-grease/shine has not been an issue. I have also used this on my styled hair, so when it has been curled and has texturing spray in it.   I DO NOT just put this on raw hair. That makes me look greasy! My hair has to be wet or have some other product on it. I also really like mixing it with my hair mousse (picked that up at my last hair appointment)."

Verb’s leave-in didn’t work for me, (funny hair texture after use and skin breakouts), and I was unsure about the brand. But I have heavy waves, fluffy 2nd day, thick hair that I highlight and it needed an oil. My sensitive skin disliked the other oils I have tried, including Argan products, and I felt the good reviews plus reasonable price point made this a logical next step.  And Ghost Oil made me so happy! Using once when wet with a leave-in (Biolage) and curl control (Bed Head) and then next day when dry for two weeks has made my hair soft, much more managable and kept the wild frizz-puff that happens at the ends very much in control. And no skin breakouts! Totally worth it:"

I'm also going gray, so the hair that is still brown is generally a different texture than the gray strands.  When I try to address the gray, the brown gets oily, but when I use 'normal' hair products the gray gets rougher and frizzier.  This oil is a really nice balance - it smooths the gray without overpowering the brown.  I feel like it's similar to Moroccan Oil in that sense, but less oily.  There really isn't much of a scent, which I also like."

It didn't repair the damage, but it minimized it; it enabled me to blow dry my hair AND cut dry time in half.  Once dry, my hair was incredibly soft and had a nice flow to it.  When used on dry hair, I feel like it sat on the surface for a few hours before soaking in; good for moisture, but did not deliver the same softness and flow as when applied to wet hair and blow dried.  Major drawback, I suffered some pretty major breakouts along my jawline, neck, and shoulders.  Not something I plan on using in the future, but it was a good band aid for the damage until I could make it to the stylist and find a good hair mask that delivers more consistent results."

After I blow dry my roots but the rest of my hair is mostly still damp, I run this thru mid-length to ends (not quite a full pump). Then touch up with a straightener and let the rest air dry. Usually I have to avoid using serums on my roots but not with this one. My layers and ends look amazing and the fuzzies up top are smooth but still light and bouncy. It smells amazing and the natural oils really make my hair look and feel great. Would definitely recommend!"

It doesn’t really do anything to my hair after wearing it for the majority of the day. Its soft and silky the first 2 hours and then it disappears. And I apply it to my hair like 2-3 times daily... lol. It works better with wet hair also. However it’s is more a serum but I like how lightweight it sets on your hair and the smell is subtle. It doesn’t linger. I want to like it and keep it, but I might have to return it for something else."

When I wash my hair, I apply this in the method I previously outlined on towel dried, damp hair. 4.) I also use it on second day hair to control fly aways and smooth my hair back out after sleep.

I decided to give Ghost Oil a try because people mentioned that it had a light, fresh fragrance and worked well. I’m so happy I tried it because I find it easier to use and I actually like the fragrance.   What I’ve found with other hair oils is that one drop too much makes me look greasy and unshowered. I have fine, dark hair that is completely unforgiving if I apply too much of any oily product. However, it seems like Ghost Oil doesn’t have such a drastic effect on my hair. The “safe range” seems to be wider than with other oils because it’s not as heavy.   Ghost Oil leaves my hair shiny, soft, and free of tangles. Plus it costs considerably less than other hair oils I’ve tried. I definitely recommend it."

I had also recently moved across the country and wanted to save some money...enter ghost oil. My hair is very fine, but I have a lot of it, so I generally have to be careful to not apply too much. With this I have found I can use 2 pumps on my wet hair without it being weighed down. It makes my hair incredibly soft and shiny and it helps tame frizz on my non wash days. I currently use another brands primer and it does work well with it, but I’m so impressed by this that I may try the ghost oil primer when this runs out!

Definitely adds shine to my hair and glosses it/makes it look healthier since I've coloured it for the first time. However, my hair is stick straight to start, and frizz/poofiness is definitely the opposite of my problems, and this oil tends to make it even flatter. (And yes, I only apply halfway down the hair until the ends, not anywhere near the scalp.) Plus, you have to spend extra time smoothing it and rubbing it across all your strands to distribute evenly and prevent strands from clumping and looking greasy. This is the case for most hair oils, I guess, but I've been using this for 2 months and still haven't figured out a way around this.   I'd recommend for curly and wavy hair types that DO want to take the volume away from your hair, or if you're planning on heat styling it after anyways."

The price is also much better than other oils at Sephora, which is nice if you're new to hair oils. It does the job like others I've tried (i.e. Bumble and Bumble, Moroccanoil, Ouai), but this is definitely a lighter oil, probably best for straight, fine hair. Tames flyaways and smooths your hair down."

I frequently end up with greasy, heavy hair due to overly oily products, even when billed as not. I agree with those who've said this doesn't do anything phenomenal (alone) for curly hair, however, it does work really well in tandem with my existing haircare regiment. Highly recommend as a heat protectant and light smoothing product for dry (not wet) hair, especially if your ends are susceptible to breakage from heat styling. It's awesome for day 2 hair or a refresh without slathering on another layer of your usual products. I use a nickel sized amount starting at my ends and use the remainder left on my hands for the rest of my head."

I have medium thick hair that has started breaking over the last 2 years due to hormonal changes. I have never colored my hair. I usually let my hair air dry and use hot rollars. wash my hair 2-3 times a week. I will be 49 this Nov and the hormonal changes have truly done a number in my hair. the Verb Ghost oil is the only thing so far that seems to be helping. I have spent lots of money on lots of expensive hair products. I put this on a little while its damp at the ends and a little before putting any heat on my hair. Makes my hair soft, and shinny and the ends are looking better. I ordered the full size last night. I am only half way through the sample. It goes a long way. Again I thank Vern for providing Sephora with a good sample size to provide in their play box. Because they did, I had enough to truly try and now they have a customer for as long as they make this product. Works for me."

It gives a nice shine to day old hair and helps bring moisture back to your ends if you're trying to stretch the time between shampooing your hair. I can't recommend this enough! I went out and purchased all of the Verb Ghost hair products due to this oil and I'm so glad I did. The fact that it is a cruelty free product is just a bonus!"

I have also been getting a full head of highlights to turn my dark brown hair to blond over the past few months, so it's experienced quite a lot of damage. I use the caviar repair shampoo and conditioner, this neutrogena hair mask (that's great by the way), and i've used for awhile the it's a 10 keratin treatment. Nothing compares to this oil. I've only used it twice so far but already my hair feels AMAZING and smooth and silky. People keep asking if I've had a haircut or blowout. This stuff is the real deal. I don't write reviews (like ever) but this ghost oil is a game changer. I'm in love."

Compared to some other brands and repurposed kitchen products, this doesn't cause me any breakouts, which is great. It also makes my bleached, dry, frizzy hair look shiny and healthy. Plus, it makes it super soft. It smells nice, reduces frizz and absorbs in if you use too much so your hair doesn't look too heavy and greasy. It's pretty difficult to overuse though, since it's so lightweight. I know some people claim it repairs split ends, but ask your stylist--nothing but a trim can fix that. It does, however, smooth them down so your ends don't seem so frazzled when you're due for a cut."

			"review_text": "After moving to Florida, I discovered my hair needed more than just my usual leave in conditioner to cope with the weather here.  Based on all the wonderful reviews, I decided to try this after my usual Josie Maran argan oil serum became impossible to find.   I have long hair that reaches about two inches shy of my waistband.  My first attempt with this I used three drops as recommended on the packaging and added two drops of straight argan oil, like I did with the Josie Maran.  That was a mess.  The next attempt was three drops of Ghost Oil only.  My hair was still a mess.  My latest attempt was two drops of Ghost Oil only.  My hair was still gross.    What happened when I used it was it dulled my hair and made it feel coated and gross.  It wasn’t until about 10 hours in that my hair started to feel normal again.  At that point it finally began getting its shine and softness back and didn’t feel disgusting anymore.  (I should also note I tried wiping it off with clean dry fingers and brushing repeatedly each attempt when all I wanted to do was wash my hair again).  As I’m typing this, I’m 12 hours into my last attempt and I’m finally satisfied with how my hair feels.  Hence, my recommendation would be to only use this if you wash your hair at night.  That way it has time to do whatever it needs to do to work properly.  If you’re like me and can only wash your hair in the morning, I’d pass this by and try something else."

First off -- all the reviewers that stated this product just weighed their hair down and made it feel greasy obviously used TOO much. The directions state 2-3 DROPS for a reason. Stating that fact, this product is an oil. It should be used sparingly, increasing the amount per application until you find the right mixture that works for your hair type. I made this mistake myself the first time I used it. My hair was GROSS after drying. Once I used a little less, I had awesome results. My hair was sleek, smooth, soft and manageable. No frizzy flyaways!  The bottom line: Use this product as directed or in a way that works for your hair type and you won't be disappointed. I currently use it 2 times a week and can't be more happy with my results. This product does exactly as it says it should.   **I originally received this as part of an ipsy bag but have since bought a full size product twice**"

The smell is wonderful and the texture of the oil is great( some of the cheaper oils fell like water instead of actual oil). The important question does is does it work? Yes and no, here's why, I have very thick 4c natural hair that soaks up any type of moisture. The oil worked better on my scalp than my hair and I honestly would have to use at least 2-3 bottles just for my hair.   That is why I gave it 3 stars because of the cost and longevity of the product. I would recommend this for all of my wavy or fine hair curly girls with low to medium porosity hair."

			"review_text": "Verb Ghost Oil  I recently purchased verb ghost oil to swap out for a usual routine of leave in conditioner in an attempt to add more moisture to my hair. If you have damage from heat tools or coloring your hair and struggle with dry, dull, or frizzy hair this is a good product to add shine and manageability and tame frizz and costs less than a lot of salon brands.   Add Shine  One or two pumps of this oil goes a long way, if you have dry ends or are prone to breakage you can easily coat your strands in this oil to boost shine and add softness. Ghost oil is a great name for this product because it does not weigh hair down or cause hair to look stringy like a heavier oils like coconut oil might do. If you have not used an oil product on your hair before start with one pump and rub between your palms then distribute evenly through your hair from the ends up. You can add more oil as you go if you feel that your hair is still dry or dull.  Fight Frizz  This product can work for you whether you have straight or curly hair and has long lasting results. This multipurpose oil can be used as a heat protectant when added to wet hair before styling and gives a very smooth finish. Adding this to hair while wet helps to create softness and manageability especially if you have wavy hair as the formula does not weigh down curls. For the best results when reducing frizz add another pump once hair is dry.   Budget Friendly   As hair oils become more popular choosing the right one can be difficult. When looking at products you will want to choose the one with the most value; although this bottle is two ounces a small amount of product goes a long way making this last a long time. Many salon brands can run upward of $30. This ingredient conscious brand gives high quality products at a budget friendly price of $16.    If you are looking for a hair oil that adds shine, manageability, and fights frizz this is a great quality product at a very reasonable price."

A little backstory: This past February my stylist stepped up my bleaching a bit in order to change my hair from a purple to coral color and it has left my hair more dry than usual. I have a frizzy hair type to begin with, so my standard routine prior to blow drying is to apply B&B tonic, repair cream and their UV oil to my damp hair. even with these 3 products I still found myself struggling to blow dry my hair straight in a reasonable fashion. I had to use multiple boar bristle brushes to achieve a smooth texture and even then my hair poofed a bit and felt dry.   This morning I used this Ghost Oil in place of the B&B UV oil and I could tell an immediate change! My drying time decreased greatly since I didn't find myself needing to switch my brushes in between or doing multiple runs through. My hair is so soft after as well and there is no poof! My hair looks healthy and not like dry straw and I am so please. A little went a long way for me, just one pump. I was also concerned with leaving this oil in my damp hair while I applied my make-up since that has typically left my hair oily when drying other brands, but this did not leave an oil streaks. This was a great purchase a I cannot wait to see what continued use does for my hair."

I've gotten many compliments on both smell & look of my hair while using this (: The little goes a long way adage rings true for this product - I've had this for half a year now, using it after every wash, and it isn't even a quarter gone. The product works well with wet or dry hair, but I've found that it does work better with wet hair as it allows your hair to dry faster and locks in the moisture from the damp hair. This product is really amazing as it leaves your hair shiny without looking greasy or feeling weighed down - an experience that I have had with other hair oils at higher price points. Would definitely recommend!!!"

As the video displayed, I put one pump into damp hair after showering (the ends and length) and one pump into hair after styling with a straightener or curling iron.   This works FANTASTIC with straightening hair as it smoothes the ends and makes them look way better and not dried out. I have ombre hair so my ends are quite processed and this stuff is magic.  HOWEVER, the size of the bottle is so disappointing lol. When I opened the box I was like aw :( its so little."

I apply two pumps then emulsify in my hands and rub through my hair starting at the ends and going up to the roots. I do this on damp hair after washing then allow my hair to air dry. I apply one more pump to dry hair before flat ironing. My hair is incredibly soft and shiny but most importantly it feels clean and light weight. Despite this being a heavier texture oil it truly does ghost in your hair and leaves a weightless moisture. I have bleached blonde dry brittle hair and this leaves me smooth and soft. It doesn't feel heavy or sticky and I don't have to wash my hands right after use. I love that it seems to absorb in and doesn't look greasy at all. It's a little expensive considering the bottle is only 2 oz. but considering I can dump my other leave ins and get the same soft moisturized hair -it evens out. For reference I was obsessed with the agave healing oil and fekkai mending elixir prior to finding this and it gives me the same results but is much lighter."

While I cannot say it repairs my split ends (I have a lot of long hair and I'm always finding them), it never claimed to do that. What it does do is smooth down my frizz and leave a lovely sheen behind. I like to apply it when my hair is damp to dry. Often I will blow-dry my hair, apply the oil midway through, then continue drying it. I always use it before flat ironing my hair, for the extra heat protection. I never apply it near the roots because my scalp tends to get oily there throughout the day, but it's absolute bliss on my long length!"

I'm very picky with hair care, and very skeptical about reviews, so it's uncommon for me to actually like something.  My hair is curly, but as it grows longer they turn into waves, so I have a mix of both. And I have a lot of it. It basically dies when it comes in contact with alcohol, so that makes it hard for me to find hair products that work. I had huge, frizzy, uncontrollable hair before trying this stuff.  Non-greasy. Lightweight. Smells SO good but it is clearly an added fragrance, be wary if you're sensitive to that. Virtually disappears after massaging it into hair. One bottle lasts AGES.

Combine that with an oily scalp/seborrheic dermatitis and dry/damaged ends and you get someone who is very selective with what she uses on her hair.   I bought this a week ago when a representative from Verb was in my store. She demonstrated a few of the products on me, so I bought the Ghost Oil on a whim as I was out of my Orofluido elixir.   I didn't think it would be anything special. I was wrong. This is by far the BEST hair oil/serum I have ever used. My hair so much softer and shinier, and I have no oily residue or build-up. I use it after I shower; I hand dry my hair with an old t-shirt then I comb it. I apply one pump from my ears down, a half pump on the last few inches of my hair and then I rub whatever is left on my hands on my head.   My hair has never felt, or looked better from using just one product. The great smell of this is a bonus. It's very clean smelling, not overpowering.   I will say that if you're looking for an oil that will straighten your hair like Moroccan oil, or keratin oils advertise this one won't. It's not heavy enough for that.  Bottom line: if you're looking for an oil that will smooth, de-frizz, detangle, shine, restore, and protect your hail without being heavy and causing buildup PLUS won't cost you a fortune, doesn't contain sulfates, phthalates, parabens, and is cruelty free this is the one."

When I use my iron to create more uniform beach waves in my hair, using this oil before is PERFECT. not only do I feel that it is protecting my hair from the heat, but also with styling. It creates just enough separation and hold as well as moisturization.  my only critique is that the scent. it's not bad and it's also not strong, which I like. I guess i'm more used to higher-end/salon level products that smell a little more... sophisticated? i just wish it smelled a little higher end, but what can I expect when it's only $16!!"

I have given so many different products a chance, and have finally found one that I truly do love.  This is by far the best.    How I use it:  - post shower, while hair is still wet I put 4 pumps of the oil in my hair (my hair is fine, but it is almost to the small of my back) - wrap hair in towel for 10 minutes - let air dry until 95% dried - blow dry and style  What it has done for me:  - zero oiliness  - not weighted down (big plus considering my hair length and thickness) - smooth feeling post blow dry - if I do let my hair air dry only, the waviness of my hair is much more manageable.   - minimal frizziness  I am purchasing another bottle of this today, and felt compelled to let others know how wonderful it is.  :)"

The pump is a bit frustrating at times but for the price and quality of the oil, I cannot complain about the packaging too much. I've tried a countless amount of hair oil products (including very high-end) and therefore I think everyone is giving this product 5 star reviews because it is great BUT it is not necessarily a miracle oil - just in case if anyone is expecting that.

I have been searching for years for a light hair oil (love Moroccan oil but it weighs my hair down and gets greasy after one day) so I was very excited to try Bumble's invisible oil. It's okay, but the Verb Ghost Oil takes the gold BY FAR, plus it is half the cost of BB Invisible Oil. It does exactly what it says it will - just a dime sized amount (I have very long, semi thick hair) is enough to soften and add heat protection without weighing my hair down or making it greasy. If I accidentally use too much it still does not make my hair greasy. I even put it on my hair when it is dry sometimes to add shine and it still doesn't make my hair greasy. I have no idea how but this is a miracle oil. It cuts drying time, too. It has a very nice light scent but you can barely notice it. This plus a little BB thickening spray makes for the perfect blowout cocktail. I love this and at $14 a bottle, I'll buy it again and again (still not even halfway though my first one and I've been using it at least twice a week for 3 months). Last but not least, I haven't had a cut since I started using it and I have no split ends or damage, so I think it really is restorative."

So when she sent me Verb Ghost Oil saying it's really good, I had to try it.  Now my hair requires constant moisture since I live in an arid desert, but I found other daily leave-in conditioners, treatments, and hair oils to be too heavy or had more protein than my hair can handle leaving it dry and brittle. Verb's Ghost Oil is pretty much fit what I needed, moisture without protein or making my curly coils droopy and sad.  I usually put in one or two pumps in my hair after a shower which in conjunction with air-drying makes my hair bouncy and soft. On days I want to straight iron, adding one pump on dry hair before using my straight iron helps my hair out in damage prevention and makes it soft and shiny.  So if you want a non-greasy, lightweight product for making your hair happy everyday, I suggest Verb Ghost Oil. It's a definite on the rebuy list for me."

These oils are too heavy to brush through my hair because day-2 hair for me is extra shiny and oily. Everything has worked at a certain point, but nothing was super spectacular.  This product has changed my hair to look healthier especially during this cold weather. After washing my hair, I use one pump to massage onto my scalp and brush remaining product through from root to tip. By the morning, my hair looks and feels smooth and healthy which is something that the 3 oils have never done before. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who wants to try a different hair oil if they've used everything under the umbrella. It's lightweight, non-greasy, lightly scented, very affordable, and a little goes a long way."
