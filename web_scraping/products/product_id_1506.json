I've tried so many drug store, department  store, and luxury mattifying cleansers, primers, powders, blotting sheets, and more and this formula wins HANDS down!! My favorite part about this product is that you can blot it over the top of makeup during the day without disturbing makeup (and I use a full face of makeup for work). It literally erases 3-4 hours of wear, making you look fresh and non-oily. There is no pilling and touch-ups go nicely over the top. Plus, the silky results blur out my skin to a perfect natural look. Love it!!!"

Both products are no longer thick and mattifying. The consistency is more tacky which I hate and doesn't help to fill in pores. I also don't like that this product has salicylic acid in it, but I don't see a better option by Smashbox for large pores.

Unfortunately I suffer with adult acne. I would say it‚Äôs usually 1-5 blemishes and not more severe. However after using a primer or foundation for a night I instantly break out the next day. I try to use face makeup with acne fighting medications. However it can be difficult to find quality makeup containing such ingredients. I saw this product while browsing at my local Sephora store. I noticed it had salicylic acid in it. However I cannot find the percentage of this ingredient on the package. A Google search said it has 2% salicylic acid, but I can‚Äôt confirm that. I can confirm that this product does not cause me to break out and appears to be helping improve my acne versus making it worse. So while this product is advertised as a shine control primer I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs also an acne control primer. I definitely recommend especially for acne prone skin."

My makeup applied nicely over it and overall I was happy with the look. I will say hours later when I was ready to remove my makeup I noticed certain areas where my foundation separated from the primer or looked oxidized. Specifically the 2 sides of my nose and the middle of my forehead. That it typically where my skin is the most oily so maybe that had something to do with it.

The matifying finish is amazing and it keeps any shine covered up. I like the texture of the primer, and what it does. I would buy again!"

I definitely love it and would recommend!"

I must admit, I have never been a fan of Smashbox primers because I felt they did not perform well compared to their cost. As far as the reformation goes, this matte primer does what many others fail to do - absorbs excess oil and shine WITHOUT completely stripping away all moisture in the area. This creates a smoother, longer lasting makeup application. Additionally, this primer works on its own on top of sunscreen. Great job Smashbox! This is a winner!"

If you are looking for a primer that is lightweight and helps with oil control this is it"

I like the way it feels on my skin. I like the way my makeup blends with it. Now I have oily to combination skin & i think it could do a better job at controlling the oils. It did control it a little but not to the extent that i expected i guess. But I still recommend you give it a try for yourself!"

The only reason it is 3 stars is because the smell gets to me. It has a very chemically smell (that eventually goes away) but its enough to take away from the product. I put this into the my regular routine but only use it when I want to look flawless.   I recieved this product for free via ipsy in the vox box."
