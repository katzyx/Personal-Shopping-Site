			"review_text": "My hair is fine, dry, colour-treated, and naturally curly with an inconsistent curl pattern, so I find it easiest to straighten my hair after washing it. I was interested in this styler from the time it was launched, and once it was on sale, I decided to splurge. The first time I used it, I followed the instructions carefully and held it at the roots for a couple of seconds before drying the length of my hair. This lead to lumps and bumps near my roots which were hard to get rid of. Now I go back over the hair closest to my roots 3-4 times instead and don't have those bumps.   I would agree that there is minimal damage from this tool. After drying my hair, I only go over the top layer with the shine shot, so the rest of my hair isn't exposed to more heat than it takes to dry it. And my hair stays straight until my next wash, although I haven't been exposed to much humidity since I bought this. So far, minimal touching up is needed between washes.   This tool doesn't dry my hair faster, however. Previously I used a hair dryer with a round brush and then a straightener. Between drying smaller sections of hair at a time and having to focus more on the roots, I would say that this tool takes the same amount of time or a bit more to go from wet to styled.   I took off one star because even on sale, this hair tool is very expensive."

			"review_text": "I have thick coarse unruly curly hair but I prefer to wear my hair with smooth waves. My process before buying this thing was to blow dry to a puffy mess, straighten, then curl my hair. I previously tried the Dyson air wrap, and had to return because it left my hair poofy and frizzy. This tool however has been AMAZING for shortening my process and smoothing my hair with what seems like less damage (no burning hair smell). I will use this tool to dry and smooth then quick run through my hair with my GHD curling iron. I do have to use the curling iron to touch up my roots at my part because this thicker design is hard to get close to the scalp. I don’t mind that though because the thick design means I can get through big sections at a time. I have been pairing it with the bumble and bumble hairdressers invisible oil primer and the ghd sleek talker for protection and shine and this duo seems to work great with the duet for a smooth, shiny, and protected look! Highly recommend!"

My hair is color treated and while it's not thick, I do have a ton of it. So maybe my hair was just too much for it to handle because it didn't dry all the way in a lot of spots, even after going over them a few times. Then while using the flat ironing function I ended up with a big ole frizz ball instead of a sleek hairstyle.  It was a great thought, but for me I will have to pass. I still love the Gold styler, so I will continue to use it along with the blow dryer"

			"review_text": "This styler is very easy to use. My hair is long and retains water so it takes 3-4 slow passes to fully dry and style the section. The Shine Shot, the 2nd step is the perfect finisher, giving shine and styling the ends straight or a little curly. The only cons for me are that it takes me a good chunk of time to get through all my hair, and the device is a little heavy so it can get a bit tiring. I do wish it came with a case like the straighteners...but at least has a silicone cover for the plates.  I think it's really helpful in some scenarios to dry and style the hair in one step, but it's not an every wash tool for me. Overall, it's a great tool and every time I use it my mind is blown at how well it does what it claims!"

			"review_text": "I have thick, curly (3a/3b) hair that is typically frizzy. before buying this I was using the airwrap with the paddle brush and then going over with a straightener. with that being said: pros: it did dry my hair in 3 passes, made it so I didn't have to straighten at a high temp, I only had to go over the roots and ends just a bit and got a smooth result over all. didn't get to use the shine shot, but I like the idea that I can get some wave and volume with it.  cons: it's pretty big and bulky, it was a little awkward to hold on one side of my head, it's heavy, so arms got sore.  I had to take pretty small sections since I have thick hair, so it took a pretty long time to finish. the roots weren't as smooth as I would like.  I'm still deciding on if I'll keep it, I was happy to get it while it was on sale. I will give it a couple more tries to decide. overall I think this is a great idea, maybe just not for curly girls."

I have never been good at the blow dry to straighten thing: because it takes so long with my thick hair… and then I have to spend more time with the straighter. Even after all that effort, I felt it was still a little frizzy. Ugh.    After a visit to a salon and seeing how sleek my hair could look, I went on a mission to figure out how to do it better myself.   Coincidentally, an influencer I follow posted herself using this product. I was so excited. It seemed to be exactly what I was looking for.   And it is! I can have my hair almost completely done from the shower in 12 minutes. Used to be 40 before! It looks salon quality and I am so thankful for this. Especially since becoming a mom, I have even less time (and patience) to spend trying to make my hair look nice.   This product —as a so-so hair person — has been such a game changer for me. Me and my new silky hair are thankful for it!"

			"review_text": "This tool isn't bad, I can see where it would be quite handy if you are someone who always wears straight hair. It's not quite for me, so I returned it. I have super thick wavy/curly hair and it's very dry in texture. I don't wear it straight very often. If they could work in a way to either straighten or get beach waves with this, then you would have something. It took me 40 mins to dry my hair (that's a lot). I had to go over each section several times. My hair was soft and I can tell it would probably get softer with more use. But, it was a humid day and with my type of hair, it poofed up and I looked like a Pomeranian. That doesn't happen with a regular hair straightener.  I went back and forth but for the price, it fit such a small niche for me. It is a quality tool that doesn't burn your hair, it's nice to be able to clamp down at the root and dry and straighten, but with my type of hair it just isn't a keeper. For reference, I use a Dyson air wrap on a regular basis (sometimes with the barrels sometimes with the smoothing brush), sometimes a Dyson supersonic with a round brush or a diffuser if I want summer curls, sometimes I blow it out and then use a T3 1.75 body waver. I'm just not feeling the straight styles much anymore. I will watch for GHD to create something similar that you can also use to body wave."

The hair looks straight in an artificial, bad-looking way. You can't style, so the straight look is what you will have. - 3. It is extremely challenging to reach and dry the root, creating a lot of frizz. - 4. It took me 34 minutes to dry half of my hair. So, I gave up and did the other half with my Dyson and it took me 16 minutes. (I have long hair bdw.) - 5. for 400 DOLLARS, the package looks cheap. (You can't compare to Dyson).

			"review_text": "I was happy to receive this product from Influenster to try so I could give my honest review. I have been using this styler for over a month in various conditions to see what results I would get. Typically 2 in 1 products fall short of expectations and company claims. I have to say I was pleasantly surprised and impressed with the results of this styler. It was a real time saver and left my hair shiny and smooth without having to wrestle with my typical large round brush and hair dryer followed by a flat iron once dry. This styler did everything with the one product. Tamed all of my flyaways with the results lasting all day, even on humid days. I am really happy with this styler. It saved me precious moments in my morning routine. This styler would also be convenient for travel for only needing to pack the one styler as opposed to multiple styling products. It’s very easy to use and blows out wet hair and straightens and smooths all in one step. It’s a real game changer. It left my hair soft, shiny, and smooth. It saved me so much time with hair styling that I got to spend more time perfecting my makeup look for the day. Between both I received so many compliments. Since it was still too early I couldn’t disclose the hair styler I had been using since it hadn’t been released publicly yet. So it was my little secret for a while. Now it’s available for everyone…enjoy the luxury and time saving to use at your discretion. Definitely worth the buy. I gave 4 stars because I am just finding out the purchase price which is a high price point for a good amount of people. But honestly it is worth the price but unfortunately perhaps unobtainable for some."

So I was very excited to be offered the chance to try this new styling tool from them. However, sadly I think that this particular styling tool is better suited for straight or thinner hair. It does dry your hair and straighten it but it takes forever. I felt like I had went over my hair a million times to get it dry and straight. This also gave my arms quite a workout, this is not a light weight styling tool at all. I feel I could get the same style in half the time with some of the tools I already own. So while I could definitely see people with straight or thinner hair love this tool. Unfortunately, this did not work out for me."

My style is smooth & silky & really feels great running my fingers through it.  This tool looks sleek & professional. It is heavier than I expected, and definitely takes a toll on my hands after a while. When it starts up, my husband says that it sounds like I’m starting my spaceship up! But it is quieter than a regular blow dryer. The heat level is fixed, and it is on the lower side, which I think contributes to healthier hair. I found that it took me way longer to finish drying & ironing my hair than the usual way that I do it.  If I give my hair a rough blow dry from my normal blow dryer, it cuts down the length of time it takes for a finished style, but then it kind of defeats the purpose of having one tool that does both."

It is a little loud when it starts up, but then it is no louder than a basic hair dryer. It glides through my hair, unlike some straighteners that pull on any small tangle. When using the Duet Style, I can have my hair go from damp and all over the place to dry and straight in 5 minutes! Even using just a basic hair dryer can take me longer than that.  With a press of a button, the Duet Style can be switched to just a hair straightener without drying. It feels like the tool is heated up and ready to go in SECONDS. I was so impressed the first time I used it as just a straightener. I was used to turning on my other straighteners and having to do something else while it heated up, but not the Duet Style.  Overall, the GHD Duet Style is a wonderful product. It dries and straightens my hair in around 5 minutes, while not damaging it like other products have. No sizzling or steam coming from my hair or the machine. My hair always comes out soft and straight. I would absolutely recommend this product!"

Very shiny and smooth yet not super flat, which I really appreciated. I was impressed with how easy it was to use and how quickly my hair was styled, without it feeling hot and without any damage to my hair. I appreciated how my hair did not get caught in the tool while I was running it through.  It took approximately 15 minutes to straighten my hair with the hot air and I have long hair that goes down to my waist. I feel like my hair looked really nice even before perfecting my hair with the shine boost feature. What I was most impressed with was how smooth and sleek my hair looked at the roots. I can’t even get that when I use a straighten but with the ghd 2 in 1 styler, it gave me that result with just the hot air setting alone! I have to admit, I tried it with hair styling products and without and although it still looks good without, hair products always help with making the hair look more sleek and smooth just like with any other device. Overall, I absolutely love the ghd 2 in 1 styler!"

It gave me salon results! Literally. You know when you leave the salon and your hair is perfectly shiny and you want to keep it for days. This product nails it! I’m obssessed and will be using this until I die. It also cuts down dry time with no damage and now I don’t have to lug around my straighter and my blow dryer.

I've tried it on about 30% air dried hair and up and it's quick, easy and exceeded my expectations. I was worried that it would dry out my hair and make it feel unhealthy, but that is not the case. Per the directions I sectioned my hair and used the styler going over each section twice as it still felt damp after using it slowly just once. Once my hair was dry, which took about 15 minutes each time, dependent upon how much my hair had been air dried prior to styling; I used the shine shot at the end as a great final touch to shine it up and reduce some of the frizz (normally my hair). I love that I can just pack this when traveling instead of a hate dryer and my straightener. It is worth noting that the styler is loud, as one could expect for it's purpose (slightly less noisy than a regular hair dryer). Also I found that the styler was very heavy and my hand would cramp a bit towards the end. However, for the convenience and quality results that are produced, I'll happily get used to it."

I do all 3 of my daughters hair before school or events and this has made that process super fast! The product is designed to keep hair healthy by not going over 365•F as well as not causing any burning.  Never heard a single sizzle.  Simply towel dry hair, turn it on and dry and style at once! Used as just the straightener or ‘Shine Shot’ part alone is so much faster than any other straightener we have ever used. The before and after is of my eldest. Yes her hair is short but it is quite thick. It used to take 20 minutes in the morning. Now only 10. Shine shot mode is quite applicable as well as their hair has improved in appearance.  The drying part is quite impressive as well. Using on my hair, it takes 20 minutes start to finish. My hair is down to my bra but pretty thin.  I have a few blow dryer brushes and always have to use a regular blow dryer to dry my hair about 80% of the way before I even get to the blow dry brush. This beats it to shreds!!! It is quieter than most blow dryers and again it is designed to dry without much damage or burning. The section for your roots is designed to blow at less pressure.  It is eco friendly as it designed to use up to 30% less energy consumption. #influenster"

I have been wanting to try GHD tools for a long time and really like how much time the duet style has saved me with drying and styling my hair. It really comes in handy on days where I wasn’t planning on washing and styling my hair and need to do it in a pinch.   It’s effective at quickly drying, each section takes a few passes to get fully dry. The straightening part took some learning… I guess I just didn’t understand what the shine shot did at first and when/how to use it. Once I tried it out more, I got the hang of it and the results got a lot better. It straightens my hair out smooth and does not seem to get too hot.   I’ll say it’s very nice when you’re in a pinch and need to unexpectedly dry and style quickly. However, for the price point, I do wish the plates were a little bit slimmer to be able to curl hair as well. Even rounding it more on the outside would be helpful so that you could also use it to create some bounce and volume. Overall I’m happy with the duet style since it is effective at drying and straightening quickly, and I have not noticed any heat damage."

			"review_text": "The GHD Duet Style 2-in-1 Hot Air Styler is a must have for anyone who is looking for smooth, frizz-free straight hair MINUS the heat damage! I have been using this product about two times a week for a month now to really test it out, and all in all I have to say that I could not be happier. I have long naturally wavy/frizzy hair but with this product I am able to achieve a beautiful just-out-the-salon look at home as it leaves my hair soft, smooth, and UNBELIEVABLY shiny! The only fault I could find is that the styler is a little bulky which is expected but it  does work wonders and is still very user-friendly and easy to use. It also comes with a small instruction leaflet which tells you how to use the tool step by step. I have found that in order to achieve the best results I start with wet, towel-dried hair and prep my hair with heat protectant as well as other before-styling serums. I divide and clip my hair up and take approximately 2 inch sections, one at a time, and hold the styler starting from my roots. After giving it a few seconds, I proceeded by moving the styler down the rest of the hair shaft. I repeat that motion until I feel that my hair is completely dry which usually takes me about 2-3 runs per section. I find that after doing this, I can already see a noticeable difference in the sheen of my hair, but using the shine shot option really adds that extra WOW factor! You wait for the plates to heat and roughly run your hair through the styler once again. The shine shot option more or less acts like a regular hair straightener over the previous hair dryer mode which really works to smoothen out any remaining kinks or imperfections. My whole process from wet to dry hair takes me about 35-40 minutes. Moreover, I feel guilt-free about using this innovative tool to style my hair as it doesn’t cause nearly as much heat damage as conventional hair straighteners. I 100% recommend this product and would rate this styler a 9.5/10. My hair feels AMAZING!"

I love that the power cord twists and not fixed in one direction on bottom. The styler did take a quite bit of power when using in my home and maked my lights dim. The styler did stay hot for awhile after use. So I love the included heat proof plate guard. It was so simple to place on styler. I did feel that the plates are a bit to large and are hard to get close to your head.  I found this duet styler easy to use because there are only two buttons. The on/off switch however i felt is a bit hard to use. There is only a small raised part which I felt could be larger to make it easier to turn on/off.  And the shine shot button is small. Both functions are a bit difficult with bigger fingers but i still got them to work. This styler allows you to dry and straighten with one tool and quicker.  After I washed and towel dried my hair. It took about 3 to 4 passes on my hair for it to become dry and straight.  With no burning or sizzling while using the styler unlike others I've used previously. I love the shine shot function. It made my hair smooth and straight with little to no frizz. It took me about a half hour to do my whole head. Having used many different straighteners and stylers i would definitely say this is a top quality product. I would highly recommend it to all who don't wish to waste time using a hair dryer, then a straightener."

It is slightly bigger and heavier than a regular straightner but not much. The packaging is amazing with clear and easy to follow directions. I have medium length, fine/thin curly hair, and after trying this styler for a few weeks, these are my thoughts. I found that the hair drying alone produced the best results when my hair was still only about 60% wet and took about 15-20 mins to dry my entire head. When I tried the hair dryer with wet hair straight from the shower and only towel drying, I needed to go over each section 2 or 3 times to get completely dry and was slightly frizzy. After the drying, I used the shine shot to further smooth out my hair and add shine. All in all, from drying to straightening, it took 30-35 mins, and I couldn't be happier with the results.  This 2 in 1 styler  is a bit expensive but a great investment  and has become my go-to styling product."

I sectioned my hair as recommended and used it right after washing my hair.  I went section by section and the tool dried my hair after 2-3 passes per section.  It wasn’t too hot to the touch but my hair came out silky smooth and completely dry.  It’s a blow dryer and flat iron all wrapped into one product.  The only reason I didn’t give this tool a 5 is because the last step when cooling the tool wasn’t clear if that was at the end of every section or after being completely finished.  I did my whole hair in 20 minutes and it normally takes me 45-60 minutes to dry and flat iron my hair.  The tool keeps your hair in good shape, I’ve used it several times and each time it gets easier.  I’ve also used it on my daughters hair that is extremely thick and curly and it worked like a charm.  If you want beautiful straight hair and don’t have a lot of time this tool is definitely for you."

			"review_text": "Ok, I will start off by saying I currently own two other GHD tools and they are fantastic. The quality of the product and the ease of use is unparalleled to other hair tools I have used. Between my Dyson Airwrap, GHD flat iron and barrel curler, all my previous tools have been tossed. I had hoped this product would be a great addition when I am short on time. Sadly, it did not live up to my expectations. The unit is sleek and feels of high quality. It is very large in size, close in length and width of the Revlon One Step but much heavier. It has the quality of other GHD products. The product works twofold, first as a hair dryer with hot air coming from the middle of the plates, then a shine shot step for shine, which is similar to a hair straightener (plates). But it is a time consuming product. I have wavy, medium thick, long, bleached, and dyed hair. I followed the instructions, going section by section. Unless your hair is very lightly damp, it will take awhile to fully dry the hair prior to using the shine shot / straighter part/hot metal plates. You will also have to section the hair first, dry all sections/full head of hair first prior to completing shine shot step, for which you will need to resection. While the concept and brand is good, this product may be more suited for those with thiner, shorter, easier to style hair. This product was a miss for me, and it's less time consuming and easier on the wrists to dry using my Dyson and using a straightener curler after. 3/5 mostly for the quality of the product, but 2/5 for performance."

It's a bit more complicated than it needs to be as far as switching modes and working it in general. My older daughter has semi straight hair and my younger has Shirley temple ringlets. On my older, it did exactly what it's suppose to. On my younger, it took hours and as we straightened it at bedtime, by morning, 50% of her curl was back. I think it takes longer because you are basically straightening your hair twice and add to that the multiple passes on each piece as you're drying it. Just not for me. Especially not for the price. If you already have pretty straight hair, it's probably gonna be great but for that cost, I can think of countless products that would work better for you. Just doesn't seem worth it to me"

It dried my hair in probably 5 mins compared to air drying of 30 mins. And I loved the fact of straightening my hair as the same time. It didn't seem to damaged my hair without heat protectants but will from now on to keep my hair healthy.

I love the concept of the 2-in-1 and do feel like it saved a little bit of time compared to separately drying and straightening my hair, but it didn’t save as much time as I’d hoped. Each section took about 5-7 passes to get to where it felt dry. Using this tool versus a conventional hairdryer can be inconvenient on days I’m just trying to get out the door - I feel like I can dry the top layer of my hair much more quickly with a hair dryer than this tool.   I also think I lost volume by using this tool - normally when I blow dry I can tease up the root but when your dryer is also a straightener it kills any chance for volume at the top, which is something I need given how fine and thick my hair is. I think this would be great for people with curly hair who are really looking for something the straighten and blow dry simultaneously. I, however, have relatively straight hair so while I enjoy straightening my hair some days it’s of less concern to me regularly than volume.   I can’t speak to hair damage as I don’t feel like I had any more than usual after using this tool, though I agree with other reviewers that having heat directly on the hair is a bit nerve wracking. It will be something I watch with continued use, especially given there is not an adjustable heat button.   I don’t know that this is a must have if your hair is anywhere near straight but if you have hair that you regularly need to blow dry AND straighten then this tool is worth trying."

Plus it can shift to a broad straightening iron that can also give more bend to the hair. I am not savvy enough to blow dry my shoulder length hair with a brush and blow dryer. Kinda could do the Revlon dryer brush but it damaged my hair and is SO loud! Gave it away after trying this. Not heavy where your arms get tired and relatively low sound volume. Actually was surprised how well it works and getting better too as I use it (currently on four uses). It’s honestly awesome."

It will take out the majority of your body and volume though so you will need some kind of product to add that back in. Also, it is a little bit difficult to get close to the root, and the tool itself is a little bit heavy if you have mobility issues.

			"review_text": "My thoughts on the duet’s DRY hair styling: This is where it wins for me. The higher temperature for the drier hair really helps with actually styling your hair. The shine-shot actually lives up to its name! My hair became so sleek and shiny! It definitely gave me *salon-level* good hair day feels! I slept on this hair and the style still kept really well for about 2-3 days. Loved it! (My hair is naturally thick and wavy and it stayed sleek and styled!)  My thoughts on the duet’s WET hair styling: It has a safe-temperature hair dryer built in, but pro tip: ALWAYS, always, always use copious amounts of heat protectant on your strands. I section my hair and make sure I coat every layer and every side of my hair. It’s vital to keeping your hair strong and not brittle! (If you’re a heat fan like me.) PROS: it beeps to let you know it’s ready to use, it cuts down the clutter in what you need to pack when traveling, the tool is seriously designed so well, it’s straight up beautiful, so I can see salons wanting to use this on their top clients. It does dry your hair without frying it…I tried to make slow passes rather than multiple passes on my sectioned hair and it dried it very well! I was definitely impressed and it does stand up against a top-tier hair dryer, which is surprising, because compared to many hair dryers it’s much smaller sized! I consider it a nice perk to not have to worry about setting exact temperatures and just let it do it’s thing! It’s such a thoughtful feature to add to a straightening tool! CONS: You may need to be careful about touching the top where it gets hot, but it’s manageable. There’s a ridge where you’re supposed to keep your fingers, which is a nice option to save you from the heat. If you have long hair, this might be a little heavy for longer periods of time. (+35 mins) OVERALL: Buy it for the superior straightening, ease of use, portability, and slimmed down hair drying.  Flatiron: 5/5 Drying: 4.5/5 Ease: 5/5 Shine-shot: 11/5"

In terms of the product itself it’s so easy to use (VERY beginner friendly) and dried my hair in minutes! It is much faster than any other hair dryer I have used before and also almost entirely straighted my hair at the same time although it was a tad frizzy. Easily enough, all I had to do was turn on the iron setting after that and my hair was frizz free after just one stroke! The whole thing took maybe 10 minutes-both to dry and straighten with my hair looking flawless after (I even curled the front pieces with the straightening setting in that time!) so I’m absolutely in love with this product!"

The sound can be a little jarring, as it sounds like a plane taking off but once you're used to it, it just sounds like a regular hair dryer. I have medium length curly hair and I sectioned my hair and would dry about 3-4 inches of hair at a time. My whole head took me an hour to dry properly. This hair tool is NOT for anyone who doesn't have the patience to do their hair and this isn't a tool you turn on to use 15 minutes before leaving the house (unless you only use the Shine Shot aka straightener part of the tool). After my hair was dry, I pushed down the button until it beeped and the hair dryer turned off and the straightener part started heating up. It gets very hot, but my hair never burned (Can't say the same for one of my fingers, oops) After straightening my hair for another 30 minutes or so, my hair looked healthy and had no frizz.

This device itself is a little bit on the bulky side, but it’s not any heavier than a normal hairdryer and it straightened my roots really well! My hair usually goes back to curly so fast and this lasted 3 days in my hair! Definitely would recommend!

My days are super busy and anytime I can find a solution that help me save time or steps from doing something I’m all for it! The Duet Style 2-in-1 is a flat iron with a blow dryer built in, so you can go directly from towel dried hair to the straight hair in one step. My hair is super fine and curly. The many times I used this product I had the same challenges unfortunately, my hair would get somewhat straight but not as smooth as when I use a blow dryer. I wanted to love this but unfortunately for me it did not eliminate me needing to blow dry before flat ironing. I think that if maybe they would have had tiny bristles in the blow dryer part that might have been more effective. What I did end up liking this for is next day touch up. My hair being fine tends to go flat. The follow up touch up with this styler also added volume which was really nice. Overalls it’s a great product, a bit heavier than the average flat iron but expected due to convenience of the dryer feature."

I have not seen another product on the market similar to this one. It is simple to use and I save on dry/style time. It is not loud compared to other dryers I have used. Both the drying and flat iron portion left my hair smooth and shiny. My only tiny complaint would be it is on the heavier side. This isn’t an issue for me as I have slightly longer than shoulder length fine hair which does not take long to dry. I see how the weight could be cumbersome to someone with really long thick hair. Overall I am very pleased with this.I would definitely recommend to someone trying to simplify their routine. It is a very handy tool to have in your arsenal."

I really like the two-in-one concept and saves you the room and extra hairstyling tool. I didn’t think that the fan was too loud when it was on the blow drying setting. I generally don’t like to use heat on wet hair but I don’t feel like this caused my hair any damage or extra frizz. I do have long hair, but it is on the thinner side so from start to finish it took me about 15 minutes. I like that there’s not a lot of complex buttons or settings, and it’s straight to the point, I also felt like the shineboost added a silky finish to my hair. The only complaint I have is that this is a very bulky straightener and it’s very hard to get the roots of your hair and hair that frames your face, I did have to use my smaller straightener to get those spots. Overall a great product but not sure I would say it’s worth the high price."

I love how my hair just glides through the plates - unlike other tools, my long hair gets caught and breaks my hair. It’s not as fast drying as using a regular dryer since I did small sections and I have really long hair. The flat iron part was pretty quick for me tho, I didn’t have to do so many passes through my hair to straighten it- 2-3 times was enough. I wish it came with a pouch so it’s easier to pack away, the silicone cover is a nice touch to protect the plates and I do use it to let the plates rest on if after i’m done.

But this product is 2-in-1, with one single product we can achieve both the purpose blow dry and hair style. Definitely I can save some time by using this single product with quick process. I am very happy and impressed with the product results. My hair is little wavy and very frizzy. Just by doing my hair drying alone I can see great straight finish look. Really impressed with the finish. Above that when I changed to Shine finish mode, have to use same as a flat iron, took small sections of the hair and began to run maximum one or two times from top to bottom….instantly you get a sleek glossy hair….easy to use, easy to change the mode. Cooling pad is given to keep the product while using. Product is little heavy while using first time after that it’s normal and when you get the desire smooth hair look you feel that it’s worth. Definitely try this product. Enjoy styling!!!! #sephora #ghd #ghdduetstyle"

I purchased my first GHD product (flat iron) in 2012 and upgraded to a newer model hair straightener in 2020, my old one STILL WORKS fine. In my opinion GHD’s are a little pricey but Worth EVERY penny!!!! Now for my review: I have used the GHD Duet Style 2-1, on myself and my daughter. When i use it on my daughters hair it works well because her hair is virgin hair, so it was a freeze to style, however when i did my hair (color treated) it was a bit harder to style and maneuver. The GHD Duet Style 2-1 is heavier than any of my other GHD flat irons so it is going to take some getting use to. When i used it on myself I had to set it down and take a couple breaks. When drying my hair the roots did take longer to dry than the rest of the hair. When my hair was finally dry it was left frizzy/ Puffy. After drying hair i switched the Shine-Shot button on, which then turns the tool into the flatiron function (heats up to perfect temp) running Shine-Shot through my hair made a HUGE difference and made the puffy/ frizziness go away 90%, im not giving it a 5 star review because i do feel it did take me a little bit longer to dry my roots, I would only hold for 2-3 seconds on roots, anything more, would start to burn my scalp because of the heat (instructions also recommend 2-3 sec. on roots) as well as the tool being just a little bit heavier to hold (in my opinion) overall i feel like its a very good product, its convenient for traveling because there is NO need to bring along separate tools to dry hair and straighten."

I was much more comfortable once I read that it will dry like a blow dryer and then turn on the plates to straighten the hair. I used it how I always use my tools which is washing my hair at night and then blow drying and straightening the next day. It dries my hair much faster then my normal dryer brush which is nice since my hair is long and thick. The straightener part was okay.

So the idea of being able to eliminate one of those heat styling tools was intriguing. I actually used to have a wet-to-dry flat iron many years ago, but it was so damaging and took forever, so I stopped using it.  This combines a blow dryer and flat iron and is not supposed to damage your hair. I will say, I did have to rough dry my hair to about 80% before using this. Otherwise, it would take FOREVER to dry my hair. It was difficult to dry the hair at the roots and took multiple passes to get my hair fully dry. It did do a good job at straightening my hair and definitely makes it much flatter than when I use a round brush and flat iron afterwards.  After your hair is dry, you can make it a regular flat iron and it heats up hotter. I did find it did help make my hair shinier. But honestly, the whole process took longer than if I just used a regular blow dryer and flat iron. The tool is also pretty heavy. I had to take breaks because my arm would get tired.

This replaces a blow dryer and straightener while cutting down styling time since you can straighten while drying your hair simultaneously. It is a little loud at first when you turn it on but once it reaches optimal temperature it's pretty quiet compared to a hair dryer. I tested the styler on myself and my 4 year old daughter. We both have very long hair. I was able to dry and straighten both of our hair fairly quickly. The shine shot function was easy to use however my daughter complained of it hurting her probably because if was too hot if trying to get close to the hair roots. Overall I definitely recommend this product."

Firstly, I’d like to mention I have fine, thin, color treated hair - medium length with bangs. I have used this product with towel dry, just out of the shower hair and damp/ 70% dry hair, and it works GREAT in both instances. With wet hair, I need to go over it twice (maybe 3 times if I grab a thick section). With damp hair, I go over it once maybe twice. After use of the dry function, my hair had volume but wasn’t as frizzy as it is if I blow dry it! To do my whole head, it took about 15 minutes. This product did not work well at all on my bangs and I ended up having to use my usual round brush and blow dryer. That being said, if I didn’t have bangs I would definitely only rely on this product to dry and straighten my hair every day!   The tool is medium heavy to me. Definitely heavier than a straightener, and I found my hand sore the day after using it for the first time (tbh my grip strength isn’t the best lol). I was very surprised with how quiet the dry function was! The shine shot is essentially just a straightener but it was nice to smooth over my hair after the dry function. The instructions are easy to follow, and I’d definitely use heat protectant spray!"

I had an Italian version of this type of tool years back and it was awful. This product looked and felt quality from unboxing. It was easy to learn to use. I love the silicon heat sleeve it comes with. I tried this multiple times on myself and I also tried it on a few clients that have different textures of hair. It works and does exactly as they say. To use, I towel dried the hair and combed it out, sectioned into quadrants then each quarter into small subsections as I worked through that area. I used a comb and tan it in front of and against the tool to keep the section I was working on smooth. That is likely unnecessary, but I like to do that with ant iron in using to get the smoothest result. The sections were dry and smooth even in coarse wavy hair! The hair has shine and softness and I love that the shine shot adds another level of smoothness or I can do waves. This product would be excellent to travel with as it can replace a dryer and iron! It is a bit heavy, but not enough to be ant issue, in my opinion. I would definitely recommend this to friends and clients. I’ll also add that in my hair, the style stayed for several days needing only touchups where my hair got bends from sleeping. I also think the hair integrity was great and this didn’t seem to be doing damage. I still always use a heat protector in damp hair."

			"review_text": "I used a similar tool to get my hair from wet to straight in middle school and it fried my hair, despite the belief that less time drying your hair with a heating tool the better. This ghd styler is much improved compared to that though. My complaints are that it doesn’t get the hair close to my scalp dry enough, it is too bulky to style shorter face-framing pieces, and you cannot control the heat settings. My hair is mid-back length, fine but thick, slightly wavy, and highlighted. It did grab at my hair a little, but I didn’t find any breakage. I didn’t use as much product as I typically would because I wasn’t sure if it would build up on the dryer part in between the plates. The dryer is pretty loud, but not as loud as my Dyson dryer. I found it to be kind of heavy too, but it’s quick enough not to be a big deterrent. It took me about 10 minutes to dry my hair after air drying for about 20 minutes. My hair wasn’t straight or sleek enough for my liking with only drying, like it looks if I use a cheap hotel dryer with a brush. But after using the shine button (which takes only seconds to switch the mode) my hair looked as good as it does when drying and then using a straightener. Though I do wish the straightener was not as wide so that I could style my hair other than just straight, this tool will be great for travel since it replaces multiple tools. I’m pleased to have received this tool, because I’m not sure I would have paid full-price for it. But if you typically only straighten you hair, and are looking for a way to eliminate multiple heat tools or simplify your hair routine, this tool would be a great idea-just maybe wait for a sale."

It is a hair dryer and flat iron in one, and the drying function alone produces excellent results. After each use, my hair looks consistently shiny, smooth, and healthy. I am obsessed with the “shine shot” feature that shifts the unit from dryer mode to a flat iron to finish and refine your hair.   I got volume at the crown by starting close to the roots and angling the dryer toward the ceiling for a few seconds before gliding down through the lengths of my hair. Also, it took a bit of extra time to get used to working with the flat iron because it is wider than the one I have. However, after a couple of attempts, I got the hang of it and was happy with how my hair turned out.  For reference, my hair is fine, long with a natural wave. Since I started using the Duet, I do not have to touch up my hair the next day. You may want to pick one up if you routinely blow dry and follow with a flat iron. You will not be disappointed!"

Although it leaves my roots a little damp, that is not a problem for me. It does take some time getting use to using it, and I have to stop and take a break because it tires my arms and hands out, due to medical conditions. That is not a fault of the machine.

I enjoy the shine shot option that makes the air turn off and turns the tool into just a straightener, because hair really needs that finishing touch to calm frizz."

When I use it on my wet hair I do not get the “sizzle” nor do I get the “burn hair” smell either like I do when I blow dry or straighten my hair. When you turn it on it blows out hot air that gives you a straight smooth dry then when you use the shine shot the plates heat up for an even smoother shine hair. I live in Texas and the humidity is sooo bad here, my hair hasn’t gotten frizzy since using it and I’ve had it for almost a month already! It is definitely worth the $400 price tag. I can even give myself a faux blowout with it!"

The only complaint I have is that it was heavy and large for my hands to maneuver in one hand but I need my other hand to comb through and create tension to create a smooth style. I love that it’s also a flat iron because I have extremely frizzy hair and have to smooth with a flat iron most days anyways so now I don’t have to switch from blow dryer to flat iron and put one away and plug in another and wait for it to warm up, it takes only at e 20 seconds for the flat iron to heat up and be ready to use. Always use heat protectant and you will love this too if you are frizzy like me. Has a long cord which I appreciate as a licensed cosmetologist"

Where I always tried to be careful to completely dry my hair prior to flat ironing it, there were times it was not quite dry, and I know I fried my poor hair. The ghd Duet is the solution to this problem!  I towel dried my hair as much as possible, then ran the styler down small sections of hair. It took about a half hour on my fine, but waist length hair. I found I didn’t even need the shine shot mode, though love that it is an option. My hair is naturally wavy to loosely curly, and it stayed impressively straight, soft, and shiny until my next wash, in fact, even after washing it was smoother than normal!   Although I know this goes a bit against the point of the styler, I think I’ll probably do a quick five minute blow dry prior to using it. I bet I’ll be able to nip my styling time down to 15 minutes that way. It will also lessen then time with high heat on my hair. That’s the only negative I can give: this styler is hot, at times even a bit much for my hands just after running my hair through it. With that said, I feel the same way about all heat styling tools and as long as you’re not using them daily, I think your hair will be just fine.  Overall, the ghd Duet Style 2-in-1 is an easy to use, convenient means of giving yourself not only incredibly straight hair just out the shower, but also smooth and shiny hair too!"

Guys, I really put it to the test because it was rainy all week when I tried this tool for the first time, and my hair is curly. I had only minimal touch ups with the heat setting in the mornings between wash days! And my hair looked great!! The only negative thing I can say about this product is that it was a little tricky to use on my front wispy bangs bc the tool is so wide. However, the width of the tool made styling the rest of my hair quick. So a fair trade off I would say!"

I purchased my first GHD product (flat iron) in 2012 and upgraded to a newer model hair straightener in 2020, my old one STILL WORKS fine. In my opinion GHD’s are a little pricey but Worth EVERY penny!!!! Now for my review: I have used the GHD Duet Style 2-1, twice this week, first time on my daughters hair and second time on me. My daughters hair is virgin hair so it was a freeze to style however when i did mine (color treated) it was a bit harder to style and maneuver. The GHD Duet Style 2-1 is a bit heavier than any of my other flat irons so it is going to take some getting use to (had to set down a take little breaks) When drying my hair the roots did take longer to dry than the rest of the hair. When my hair was finally dry it was a bit frizzy/ Puffy. After drying hair i switched the Shine-Shot button on, which then turns the tool into the flatiron function (heats up to perfect temp) running Shine-Shot through my hair made a HUGE difference and made the puffy/ frizziness go away 90%, im not giving it a 5 star review because i do feel it did take me a little bit longer to dry my roots, I would only hold for 2-3 seconds on roots, anything more, would start to burn my scalp because of the heat (instructions also recommend 2-3 sec. on roots) overall i feel like its a good product, its convenient for traveling no need to take separate tools to dry hair and straighten, will continue to use and try to conquer this beast lol"

Flyaways aren’t an issue and my hair doesn’t try to curl or poof out the way it normally does with my regular blow dry.   Cons - this tool has some heft to it which tires your arm after using it for an extended period of time. My daughter and I both have thick hair so it takes several passes to completely dry our hair compared to a brush and a regular blow dryer.  I know that the reduced heat is better on our hair so I’ll happily have a tired arm in exchange for healthier hair."

I have extremely long thick hair & it takes me 30 minutes to fully dry/straighten it straight out of the shower with this. It feels like it’s going slowly, but that’s very comparable to regularly drying with a blow dryer then straightening or using my huge round blow dryer brush then still having to straighten it. I like that I can use this after I shower but don’t wash my hair but it’s still a little wet… or after spraying some hair perfume/oil on my dry hair & it makes it feel so much refreshed & voluminous so I can go longer between washes. I also like that you can turn the air off & then it just becomes a large flatiron. That’s why I have kept it plugged in & haven’t had to pull out anything else. The only things I think could be improved on are the noise when it starts up 😳 it seriously sounds like something with a turbo boost! My husband came into the bathroom to see what in the world was happening in there 😂 It would be nice to be able to turn just the straightener part on without having to turn the air on first, mainly because of the noise. The other thing is that I don’t exactly feel like I can get a comfortable grip on it because my fingers want to go right in the space that the on/off buttons are. I don’t have an issue with the weight or size like others mention, but I’m used to using a huge round blow dryer brush so this is a much better option than that."

After your hair is dry there is a button,when you press it you start straightening your hair without the blow-dry and then your hair gets so soft,silky  and shiny.  The only minus is that the tool is a little heavier than usual, I had to take a  little break because my arm got tired, but it wasn't problem for me at all. Definitely recommend it!

Literally cut my styling time in half and looked great! I’m obsessed!"

This tool was quick and I didn’t end up with any of my broken baby hairs sticking up or looking fuzzy.   I will say that you should use smaller than recommended sections to ensure that you don’t have to do multiple passes, and to go slower than you think you should.  The shine boost feature just turns off the blow dryer part and I found that it left the sections pretty hot afterwards so I would recommend a heat protector for sure. The on/off switch is conveniently placed on the handle and pretty tight, so you don’t have to worry about potentially turning it off while in use. Overall, I liked it and I’ll continue to use it, but at the price I don’t think I would’ve purchased it myself just for a time savings."

ShineShot turns the hairdryer part off, and works like a straightener. With unparalleled results. I've never used anything that has been able to tame my tresses the way that this product has!

I then tried this product on my clip in extensions and that made drying them so much easier and faster. Lastly, I tried it on my niece who has ringlet curly hair. Again, just the dryer alone straightened her hair so well I barely had to use the shine shot. I was shocked how well this dryer straightened the hair with no frizz and gets all the way to the root. This tool is very easy to use I would even recommend to children or people who just aren’t good with styling. I will say the wetter your hair is, the more passes you have to make with the dryer which can be time consuming. I would recommend letting your hair air dry just a little bit before using if you want to save time."

It’s a double flat iron with air blowing from the center at a temperature that allows it to work on damp hair.   I used a heat protectant and then turned the Duet on. I found the drying process to be effective though a bit tedious with thick wavy/curly hair (ok, I find styling my hair tedious, in general). I separated sections to work with and went over them several times. The device caught on my hair at one point, leaving me struggling to get the hair out of a hot tool. Not fun. It tore several strands. That only happened once, but it left me cautious.   Once my hair was dry, I switched to the finishing mode for smoothing/shining. The air stopped and the plates got hotter. It worked very well, leaving my hair straight, smooth, and beautiful!  Overall, I like the ghd Duet. I hope they can smooth the places where it catches hair, so this doesn’t happen again. It’s hard to see exactly where that’s happening while you are desperately trying to get your hair out of a hot hair tool. It has tremendous potential."

The Duet 2-in-1 dries your hair while smoothing it straight - it did a great job - my hair is super silky, smooth and straight!  It feels and looks super healthy - I’m still trying to figure out how to get more volume in my hair while using this tool.  Overall, I really like it and would recommend to family and friends. It’s super light and doesn’t feel hot when using it!"

			"review_text": "Thank you to Influenster and ghd for sending this to me free of charge for the purposes of testing and review. First, a tiny bit of history. Well…kinda. It’s been a while so bare with me. I usually use a blow dryer, flat iron and or curling iron to style my hair. I love my hair smooth yet voluminous . Sleek. Full of body and shine. Many a companies have launched a wet to dry iron. From Babyliss to Drybar and Remington. Unfortunately, many seem to fall just short of the finish line. Also, stylers from the past tend to damage hair the longer you use them and will eventually end up in the appliance graveyard. I wasn’t keen at first because of past experiences, but I was raring to give it go, nonetheless. It’s sleek, weighted and made of great quality materials. Packaging, is awesome as always with the standard literature you normally find in hair style appliances. Comes in two color ways: white and black. The white is beautiful but probably won’t stay that way for very long. Floating plates, shine shot and air-fusion technology. It even has a bespoke acoustic system to lower sound levels. Auto sleep mode with pro length swivel cord.  Through trial and error I found it’s best on towel dried hair using and upward motion at the root and Turing under the ends for the perfect 2-in-1 style.  I will say it is quite cumbersome so it definitely took some getting used to. Creates an ridiculous amount of shine and I was able to style my long frizzy and shoulder length hair in about 25-30 minutes. This 2-1 styler is quite expensive. ($399 at Sephora) so it’s definitely a serious investment. I wish it was less expensive and a little lighter in weight. The ghd Duet Style 2-in-1 gets a thumbs up from me. If you have the cash to splash, it’s awesome!"

It heats up extremely fast and drys my hair in just a few passes and the shine shot feature is my favorite! My hair has never been this soft, shiny, and healthy looking! And in a fraction of the time! The only thing that I don’t like is the weight of the styler, but I understand why. I did have to stop a few times because of my wrist but with each use I’m getting used to it. I have extremely long and thick hair and this is my new favorite hair tool!

That being said, it typically takes forever to dry my hair using a normal hair dryer. But with this device, after towel drying and running a detangling brush through my hair got it dry in about half the time. The downside is that it is very heavy, which made my arms super tired by the time my whole head was dry. There is another function that functions as a hair straightener, but all three times i tested it, i had to rest and then revisit. Of course this may not be the case for everyone, my arms are just weak. Overall, i love this duet style 2 in 1 and would recommend it to everyone, just based on how much time I save drying my hair.

I have not used this as an actual flat iron just as a blow dryer. I think if I turned on the heat it would for sure flatten my hair! When I get out of the shower my hair is naturally wavy… The first picture (sorry for bad lighting) it’s pretty straight by end of the night 6ish hours later I’ve got some wavy going… Which I don’t mind! I love big hair! I think this product is good for drying makes it a bit easier! I think it will be good for flat ironing as well!

Once my hair has been fully dried, I can press the Shineshot button to turn it into a flatiron. It can straighten and curl your hair while making your hair more shine!

This is TOTALLY different. have shoulder length hair on the thinner side that has been highlighted so it is relatively fragile, it is straight with some wispy curls at my hair line. The drying function on this tool is amazing. It cut my dry time in half! It does not get too hot and dries so quickly. have trouble drying the back of my hair straight because of where it lands on my back/ shoulders it sometimes flips up, the GHD Duet 2-in-1 Hot Air Styler prevented the flip where the hair passes through the tool like a hair straightener. It was super easy to switch from hot air to the smooth shot. Because the plates are so large, I had a hard time with the front of my hair. The Duet was too big to tame the curly wisps at my hairline so I had to use my normal straightener, that's the only reason I gave 4 stars and not 5. Overall this is a great product and I would 100% recommend it to someone in the market for a new hair dryer."

It took me about 15 minutes to finish drying my hair and about 5 minutes to go over again using the shine shot.  My hair felt and look silky smooth.  My sister came over right after and noticed right away the difference in the way my hair looked. She used the duet style and said she wants it for herself too now.  At first, I couldn’t figure out how to correctly dry my roots as well, but once you part your hair in even sections and position the duet styler correctly, it becomes easier. After using it couples of times, I’m already a pro and my hair looks better every time.  Not mentioning the aesthetically pleasing packaging and styler! I love the way it looks on my vanity.

I tried this in all hair types, fine, coarse, curly, wavy, coily, dense and thick.  Every person loved it!  You could use the dryer portion to dry the roots without burning the scalp, which was awesome!  It also heats up very quick!  It sounds like a rocket ship firing up the engine!  We got a kick out of that!  I used it on towel dried hair, in 2 inch sections.  I used it with and with out very lightweight products to smooth and protect the hair.  Drying time was great, I am an experienced hairstylist, so I am pretty quick… for a non stylist or less seasoned blowdryer this would probably be a huge time saver!  The shine shot flat iron function was awesome.  Once you switch to this function, the tool changes temperatures quickly then you run this over dry hair.  This is now your final flat iron smoothing step.  I love that this takes the place of two different tools, but still gives you the same great GHD quality!!!  The hair was left incredibly healthy (no burning, dryness or crispy hair) and beautiful!  I was sent this tool by Influenster in exchange for my honest opinion.  I would absolutely spend the $400 on this after using it!  You won’t be sorry!!!"

After using it for about a month, I can say that I like ghd Duet 2-in-1 styler due to its duality. This is a hair dryer and flat iron in one hair tool. My hair is very wavy and ghd Duet 2-in-1 styler helped by making it shiny and straight after using it.  How did I use it? After a shower a dried my hair with the drier setting, which is the default setting, this setting is efficient and it actually dried my hair and also my hair was untangled after this. After drying I thought it my hair looked already nice. I can use my hair that way too...  I proceeded to turn on the flat iron setting and wow my hair was straight and shiny really quickly. I love this hair tool because it does what it promises and from now on it is my to go drier/flat iron hair tool. This is exactly what I was looking for. This Duet is good looking and easy to use. Since I like to travel this will save me luggage space which is very important for travelers. Love this white version!"

You can achieve volume with this but you have to learn to use it as a style tool other than the normal straightener.

I have to go over sections of my hair a few times to get them dry enough to use the flat iron setting, but when I do it leaves my hair very shiny. I lent it to my mom to use and while she liked it, she found it a little heavy and difficult to use on the back of her head.

It looks like a bulky tool and I was thinking that it was a straightener for wet hair and worried that it would burn my hair. I completely misunderstood what the product was. It’s literally a hair dryer and straightener in one. Be sure to follow the product instructions. I used my amika wizard spray protectant on towel dried hair. I divided my hair into four total sections and it works best if you don’t use too big of a piece of hair to work with. No bigger than the size of the straightening plate. This dries hair so well, and relatively quickly. From towel dried hair and after drying I went over with the shine shot. The whole thing took about 22 minutes. Saves a ton of time. It makes your hair soft and does something a regular straightener doesn’t do for me and gave me some root volume. I noticed that with this tool if I put my hair up that mysteriously my rubber bands don’t leave crazy lines in my hair. This is now my very favorite thing. I really don’t know how I ever lived without this before. I recommend to everyone to have this product and if anything ever happens to this one I will be repurchasing it."
