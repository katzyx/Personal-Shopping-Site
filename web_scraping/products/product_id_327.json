	"ingredients": "",
	"how_to_use": "Suggested Usage:.Using Eva:.-Please fully charge your Eva before use. .-Before pulling in your partner to play, try using Eva solo to see how it fits and works best for you. Keep in mind that Eva fits differently for different people..-Eva has one button to control power and intensities—hold to turn on and off and press to cycle intensities...How to Place Eva:.-Place Eva where it feels best..-Pull each labium (lip) over one wing at a time and adjust as necessary..-Don’t worry—it may take a few minutes and a couple of tries to get comfortable..-No dice? No worries. You can try shifting positions (e.g., lying back vs. sitting up, spreading your legs more) or asking your partner for a hand...Tips and Tricks:.-Eva plays well with others: toys, strap-ons, penises, etc..-A single finger can help hold Eva in place while switching positions..-Lube can make things more intense, but it also might make Eva’s wings slippery..-For more pressure or security, try wearing panties over Eva (crotchless or otherwise) or wearing Eva under a harness...Charging Eva:.-Battery life (high intensity/steady mode): One hour..-Charge time: Four hours..-The LED indicator is located on Eva’s front-facing side, near the button on top..-Eva will blink green while plugged in and will stay green when fully charged. On low battery, Eva will blink red. .-Eva’s LED was designed to remain discreet while charging, so it may be a bit dim in a fully illuminated room. We suggest turning the lights off or cupping your hand over it to verify that it’s charging correctly...Travel Mode:.-Eva cannot be turned on accidentally while in Travel Mode. .-Hold the power button for 10 seconds to activate Travel Mode—the LED will blink for those 10 seconds and flash red at the end. .-To exit Travel Mode, place Eva in its charging base.. .Caring for Eva:.-Eva is waterproof. .-Clean Eva after every use using either soap and water or a water-based sex toy cleaner like Dame’s Hand &amp; Vibe Cleaner (sold separately). .-Do not use 100 percent alcohol-based solutions. .-Dry thoroughly. .-Store Eva separately from other toys and away from extreme heat or cold.. .Caution:.-Do not overextend or twist Eva’s wings..-Do not use silicone-based lube with Eva..-Do not clean Eva with products containing petroleum or acetone..-Do not boil, bake, microwave, or run Eva through the dishwasher..-Do not submerge the charging base in water; it’s only water-resistant.",

As a couples vibrator this was a nice addition to the mix, it helped me climax faster but not too fast. I could NOT wear it though, as hard as I tried- it kept slipping so I had to hold it myself, which was a bit awkward at times but it did it’s job.  Now as an individual vibrator I’m not motivated to use it again, the actual vibration is very shaky versus buzzy and it took my longer to climax on my own compared to other vibrators I have."

I had difficulty keeping this device in place, it would typically slip out within a matter of minutes. Although it can be powerful, it is extremely loud and hard to ignore. If the body of Eva were smaller i feel like this could work better for more people. Another downside is if you don’t like this product Sephora will not allow you to return. I would pass on this product."

It came with a little cloth bag and a covered charging station. It’s too cute that I just want this little baby to do it magic on me.   It perfectly fits me and I really like the vibrating frequency. It feels very good instantly and made me reach orgasm every time I use it. It doesn’t fall off and won’t hurt either without lube due to the soft surface texture. It really helps me a lot when I and my boyfriend do different positions I still get the pleasure I need and keep moisturized.   I am a petite size, so when I move all the way up it stretches a little bit my skin. I would say when it reaches level 3, it's a bit loud.   Overall I really love it with the whole packaging and covered charging station and most important I am able to get an orgasm without feeling exhausting!!!"

I don’t personally find that I need heavy stimulation and the first two settings on this did nothing for me. I would probably avoid this if you need heavy stimulation. That being said, it’s adorable. Super fun that it comes with a wireless charging case, a carrying bag, a sticker, and the toy itself is just downright adorable.

Holding toys in place was cumbersome and not the most effective when being intimate with my partner, and this does what it claims to do in providing a hands-free vibrating experience. For the price I do find it to be noisier than I expected, but that isn’t a real issue for me at this time. I do wish there were more settings that offered more rumbles and not just buzz’s, but overall this is something that’s going to be used frequently and often with my partner."

I will not be downgrading the stars on this product as it’s so individual and so many people love it but unfortunately it did not work for me. It’s also a bit too noisy which I found distracting. The packaging, design and concept is so clever but unfortunately the product just did not work for me. I definitely recommend giving it a try as you won’t know until you try it out and form your own opinion."

I found that what works best is to first punch in Eva’s wings to place in. Then I found that she stays in place and is perfect for hands-free solo-play or couple-play so your hands can do other things!

First, this is a rarity among other toys. Most are best used solo, while this is clearly designed to be used either alone or with a partner. While that makes it unique, you’ll need to consider is: 1. Sensitivity. Since it’s positioned in a different area, will you individually LOVE this, or on the other side of the spectrum, be able to handle it? This is all to tell you: it’s strong! I suspect you’ll either rate this A+++ or F- depending on your body! There are multiple settings though, and you may find one is right for you. 2. Positioning. Please see Sephora’s video and understand where this is placed. This is because the shape of your outer labia plays a role in how well this stays in place. I see a reviewer struggled with this and I can fully understand why. Others will not struggle at all.  I’m giving it a solid 5 stars as I feel it’s a great device and does what it claims extraordinarily well. Charging is easy, storing is discreet, and usage is intuitive. I hope my review helps you decide if you’ll love it or hate it!"

It’s a fun addition to partner sex but it’s sometimes hard to get it positioned just right/have it stay in place. It’s also quite expensive for the size."

This toy is so little and light weight. And the silicone is super soft. And the color options are cute too. For me I did have to finagle the positioning to get it right where I want it, but it stayed in place easily. The three level options in strength was good. None were too weak or too strong. Just a good variety for choice. I definitely will be enjoying this convenient little toy with my partner!"

I had no less than 14 Os on Valentine’s Day—due to a combination of factors—but Eva was an MVP. It doesn’t have to stayed glued in place to feel incredible; easy (and fun!) to adjust as you go."
