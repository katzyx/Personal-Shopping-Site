This daily exfoliating cleanser has a creamy texture that lathers up beautifully and feels gentle yet effective on my skin. My skin tends to get dull and uneven, but after using this cleanser, I’ve noticed a significant improvement in both brightness and texture. The combination of glycolic and lactic acids really helps refine my pores and clear away any buildup, leaving my skin feeling fresh and smooth. I love that it also includes natural enzymes from papaya, pineapple, and pumpkin, which exfoliate without causing any dryness or irritation—something I’ve struggled with in the past when using other exfoliating products. What’s even better is that it removes makeup and sunscreen effortlessly, so I don’t need a separate makeup remover. I have combination skin, and this cleanser seems to balance everything out, leaving my face feeling clean but not stripped. I’ve definitely noticed a clearer complexion with fewer breakouts. Overall, I highly recommend this cleanser for anyone looking to brighten and refine their skin!"
