Very silky texture, smells pleasant. The moisturizer never fails to make my skin feel soft and moisturized without being greasy and lies great under makeup (Haus Labs foundation and cocneraler)."

			"review_text": "nothing compares to honey halo, especially in the colder months for my very dry skin. with winter approaching, my other moisturizer wasn't cutting it and left me feeling itchy and dry mid-day. my face stays hydrated all day long and looks so healthy and plump. the lip smoothie is nice too, not so much as a hydrating balm, but as a nice glossy finish. the lip smoothie is essentially a free item considering the regular jar of the moisturizer is the price of this kit, so it's worth it."

			"review_text": "This cream is my holy grail. It leaves my skin feeling so nourished and glowy in the morning when I wake up. This was my was first time trying the lip smoothie and I love the texture. Its thinner than the laniege lip mask, but more moisturizing in my opinion. My lops feel so soft in the morning snd there’s always a bit of product still on y lips. The smell is also delicious, it smells a bit like bron butter cookie or something."
