I  have not noticed any huge differences in my hair as of yet, but I'm hoping with continued use, I'll see some improvements. I do like how easy this is to apply and I love that it's a rinse out formula because most oil type products are too much for my fine hair. The scent of this product is somewhat of an herbal type smell. I like that it's not too strongly scented."

I have no idea if it’s strengthening my hair, but it does feel nourishing while using it. My frizz was still present, but I don’t know that any one product could get rid of it. The ingredients are good, so I’m sure with consistency this will boost the health of my scalp & hair. This oil was gifted by Aavrani."
