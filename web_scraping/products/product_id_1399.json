It's less bright pink and more muted mauve-meets-berry. The shimmer doesn't show unless you're super close. And then there's the smell/taste. It's lipstick from 30 years ago before they started scenting them with floral and food scents. It's not pleasant and lasts for awhile. I did find it not sticky and it seemed to moisturize my lips after it wore off but I could definitely feel it on my lips the whole time. I doubt I'd purchase it again."

It feels so comfortable on the lips, almost like a hydrating balm with just the right amount of gloss.The sheer tint adds a beautiful, subtle wash of color that enhances my natural lip tone without feeling heavy. Plus, it’s packed with nourishing ingredients, so my lips feel soft and moisturized throughout the day.The gloss also has impressive staying power for such a lightweight formula, and I love that it’s made with clean, eco-conscious ingredients. It’s perfect for a quick pick-me-up, or as a finishing touch to any makeup look. If you’re into effortless, glowy lips with a healthy shine, the Saie Lip Gloss is a must-try!"

The lip oil deposits a sheer wash of color and the shimmer looks really fine rather than super in your face glittery. It doesn’t feel very sticky to me which I like, but that usually means that it won’t last super long on the lips either. There is a slight playdoh smell when I put the wand directly under my nose, but I don’t smell it when I apply it to my lips. I much prefer a non-fragranced product rather than having a really artificial smell. Overall I would recommend this to someone who wanted a natural looking lip oil that is non-fragranced."

The shade Disco adds a subtle, ethereal glow with just the right amount of shine, perfect for that glossy but not overly flashy look.  It feels incredibly hydrating on the lips, thanks to the oil-infused formula, and it leaves them feeling soft and comfortable throughout the day. I also noticed that it wears well, staying glossy for a few hours without needing constant reapplication.  What’s great about this gloss is its versatility. It looks stunning on its own for a natural, glowy finish, but it also pairs beautifully over lipstick to add that extra dimension. The shade Disco has quickly become a staple in my makeup routine for that effortless, glowy vibe.  If you’re on the hunt for a lip gloss that combines hydration, shine, and a hint of shimmer, Saie Glowy Bounce in Disco is definitely worth trying!"

What I love most about this lip formula is how it feels like a perfect hybrid between a gloss and an oil. It’s incredibly hydrating and leaves my lips with that juicy, plumped-up look without any stickiness.  The shimmer in this new formula is just stunning. It's the perfect balance of being eye-catching without feeling gritty or overpowering. You get that beautiful, reflective sparkle that adds dimension to your lips, but it’s so finely milled that it feels smooth and comfortable. This is the kind of product that not only enhances your natural lip color but also makes you feel glam in just one swipe."

It can be worn alone or top a lipstick for more color. I like that it lasts a decent amount of time.    Hd more color. Overall, a great gloss for a great price!!"

			"review_text": "Shake leans neutral-sheer with silver micro- shimmer on my lips as a woc with a golden dark complexion. One swipe looks like hydrated, subtle gloss, and two applications is popping & sexy. This glossy feels even better as it warms up. It feels comfortable, buttery,and not sticky. My lips feel smoother. There's no added fragrance or flavoring. The gloss smells like its natural ingredients: castor oil,shea butter....period. Therefore, this gloss doesn't irritate my lips."

			"review_text": "When Saie came out with glossybounce last year, I got all of the shades and they were and  still are some of my all-time favorite lip products. So when I found out that they’re coming out with shimmer shades, I couldn’t be more happier. The formula is lightweight and they don’t feel heavy on the lips, but they stay on really well. There is a barely noticeable flavor, but it is not strong, and it is very pleasant. These lip oils look extremely shiny on the lips and make them look plump. I got shades Disco and Remix and they are both gorgeous on the lips. They look beautiful by themselves, but you can mix and match the shades with so many different lip liners. I often wear them around the house with no lip liner, but then use one when I run errands to get that extra juicy lip effect."
