It looks great all day and can withstand a hot flash!

I ended up applying 2 different settings - one spray (One Size) and one powder (my tried and true l'oreal infallible setting powder), which finally did the trick and I was able to wear it. If you have dry skin, this may work for you.  One final thing. The sample container was small (obvi) but had enough product for my entire face. But the fine print on the packaging said quantity not sufficient for sunscreen protection which means you'll still need sunscreen before you apply."

I always use a makeup primer, and I have found that putting a tiny bit of this foundation onto the back of my hand, and then a couple squirts of my Sephora setting spray, really helps to spread the foundation in a thin layer on my face. I use a tapping motion in the spots I want heavier coverage. AND I use the amazing BK Beauty foundation brush, which really makes a difference in application!  I highly recommend using a setting spray mixed in with this foundation when you apply...try it and see if it helps.

I'm not one to use base products all over the face, I like to just target my undereyes, blemishes, and redness areas.   I wasn't a fan when I used this all over the face like I am with most foundations. However, I tried it again and have found it to look amazing using these rules that I've found works for me: 1) make sure my skin is moisturized. maybe this is obvious to some people, but it really makes a difference. 2) i use a little at a time, layering. and i mean a LITTLE at a time. i find it looks way less cakey this way, and this product has great coverage so you can just build it up using light layers. 3) i use my fingers. it's easy, i feel like the warmth of my fingers blends it in better.  overall, this is a really beautiful product. the first time i really got it right using the above steps, i couldn't stop looking at my skin. it's a great all-over product that i can use on blemishes, redness, and the undereye area."

			"review_text": "Not for sensitive skin types! I'd recently ran out of my everyday CC cream by 'Juice Beauty' - the ONLY CC cream I've ever repurchased, and had a small tube of this - a product I've heard lots about, and decided now's as good as any time to give it a try.  The pros: it has a higher SPF...50 as opposed to JB's 30, it's not anywhere near as 'dewy', and likewise has an ingredients list that reads like an encyclopedia of botanicals!  The cons: it's costlier per ml. And more importantly something in that mix, I'm guessing the citrus oils; gave me a rash on my nose and forehead after less than a week of applying every morning, and I ended up giving this away. It could also have been the silicones or possibly the Eucalyptus oil...who knows?  Disappointed to say the least, as the coverage was PERFECT for me - medium, not too dewy and didn't emphasize any of my fine lines or general rough texture (on those days I've been too lazy to exfoliate) which I was fearing it might do from reading some of the other reviews. For a short while I felt like I'd found an even better version of my beloved JB CC cream, and was happy to overlook the price difference, but unfortunately it wasn't meant to be.

I bought a mini size in shade light that was, I'm not kidding, pure orange. I had to go in the store to test and discovered my perfect shade is fair ivory. This makes no sense since I am light/medium usually with olive undertones. I decided to keep the mini in light to mix with my full size fair ivory for my summer shade.   I'm writing this review because I think the shade matching is incredibly difficult if you can't make it into the store to swatch. With all that being said, I do still love the formula of this product. It's pretty full coverage (I mean like, I use half a pump to cover my entire face, and blend it out with a beauty blender). It's perfect for mornings when I just want to throw something on like it's a moisturizer. I swear, I don't even need to wear priming cream underneath for it to look good. Without primer, it can cling to some dry patches on my face but it's really not too bad for me. With primer, my skin looks glowing all day. It almost looks better as the day goes on. I will also add that it oxidizes so in my opinion, it would be wise to shade down if possible.   Super easy to use, just use with a light hand. Giving four stars because it's VERY expensive from what it once was and the shades run incredibly dark."

It lasts pretty well to the end of the day too -- even though it fades a bit as it gets absorbed into the skin throughout the day, it somehow keeps my skin looking even and vibrant until I take it off. Plus it has SPF 50?! Regarding some negative reviews I've seen, I would say the trick is to find the right shade for you as my right shade looks so natural on my skin it barely looks like I'm wearing foundation, and because of that I often wear it alone, with not even mascara!

When I first started using this the palest shade was ~ actually ~ pale, the coverage was medium and it looked like skin! Then the shade range took a turn for the worse with all of them becoming orange-y and not enough options for complexions on either end of the spectrum. However, I would always find my way back to it because I loved the finish and it was one of the few products that agreed with my extremely sensitive, dry, acne prone skin. I was willing to make the shade work with a lighter concealer and despite finding the product would kind of go off.. before I would ever finish a tube (3-4 months) , unlike the first couple years of using this. I took a break from using this to try another foundation and in that time frame I also developed perioral dermatitis. When I came back to try this (after releasing a shade pale enough!) after minimizing my makeup routine and healing the dermatitis it triggered another outbreak/no longer works for my skin anymore! It is too bad because it worked for a long time and the claims are for extremely sensitive skin conditions like PD,etc (with some even saying this is one of the only foundations that work for it)! Happy to see the shade  The pros: goes over flakiness well, skin-like finish, can be good for sensitive skin ?, does not make my skin feel tight, moisturizing and plumping The cons: shade range isn’t great- even for the new pale colours they are very yellow, transfers if you rub or touch your face/clothing, starts to break down (but doesn’t look too bad), the price honestly.. has gone up over $20 since I first started buying it :("

			"review_text": "It is with immense disappointment that I share my experience with IT Cosmetics' CC+ Cream Full Coverage Color Correcting Foundation with SPF 50+. My encounter with this product at Sephora has left me questioning the brand's claims and its ability to deliver on its promises.  Excited by the prospect of a full-coverage foundation with added skincare benefits, I was eager to try the CC+ Cream. However, my excitement quickly turned to frustration upon application.  Despite the full coverage claim, the foundation's coverage was anything but. The formula proved to be streaky and difficult to blend, leaving me with uneven patches and the need for extensive layering to achieve even minimal coverage. Instead of achieving a flawless complexion, I ended up with a cakey and unnatural finish that was far from the radiant glow I had hoped for.  Furthermore, the foundation's color selection left much to be desired. The shade range seemed limited and failed to cater to a diverse range of skin tones. This oversight is disappointing given the industry's growing emphasis on inclusivity and the varied needs of customers.  Equally concerning was the foundation's staying power. Despite claims of long-lasting wear, the CC+ Cream seemed to break down and fade within a few hours of application, leaving me with an uneven complexion and requiring frequent touch-ups. This lack of longevity is particularly disappointing considering the high expectations set by the brand.  To make matters worse, the customer service experience with Sephora has not been satisfactory. After reaching out to express my dissatisfaction with the product, I received a response that lacked any meaningful resolution. It is disheartening to invest in a product that falls short of expectations and then receive a dismissive response from the retailer."

The texture of my skin became very bumpy and inflamed after using this which is the opposite of what you want skincare products to do!

I gave up on it until recently. I decided to try it again. I was surprised to see they expanded the shade range. The new shade is my perfect match! It still applies so beautifully. It looks so natural but it only lasts for a few hours. It transfers terribly no matter how I set it. I can only get a few hours of wear before it starts to transfer and disappear on my face.

The coverage was out of this world and the built-in SPF didn’t break me out, which is very rare for me. I was heartbroken when I had to let it go because the lightest shade at the time, Fair, was just way too dark for my complexion. When I saw that the shade range had expanded, I ran to the store to swatch some contenders and found a perfect match in Fair Porcelain! Applied it the next day hoping that the formula hadn’t changed and fortunately, all was as well as I remember. My undereyes did admittedly look a little ashy over time, but perhaps this foundation simply doesn’t pair well with my current undereye CC (it wouldn't be the first). I’ll find an alternative concealer if I must - I’m committed to keeping this product in my collection! Full coverage without the weight of a full-coverage foundation, honestly the best, especially through summer. I wear the Hourglass Veil Mineral Primer (my holy grail) underneath it like I would with any foundation/CC/etc. and it holds up beautifully. Truly don’t think I’ve ever had a better foundation shade match for my complexion, and I’ve tried a boatload of them. I do think there could be a further shade range expansion across the board for this product but think this is a good start. Thank you, ITC 🙌🏻 P.S. If you find this version of the CC too drying, maybe give the Nude Glow version a try."

I used a beauty blender to apply it, but you could use fingers or a brush. It didn't smell like much of anything, which I appreciated because I don't wear SPF on my face due to the sunscreen odor. I like that I only need this product which claims to be both anti-aging, SPF, blemish coverage, and hydrating. I'm not too fussy in the morning when it comes to face prep, but I do like wearing something every day to even out my skintone.   This is an excellent product if you live in a very sunny area or spend a lot of time outside. The physical sunscreen doesn't absorb into your skin.  I would say to take your time picking out a shade because it looks exactly like the shade on the package, and it sits on top of your skin rather than blending into it. Also, get a good makeup remover because this stuff won't come off with just soap and water."

I absolutely love how it has SPF 50 as well, since we all need sun protection daily. Especially those of us with rosacea, you know how insanely important sunscreen is to us. This CC cream holds up extremely well even with over 90% humidity outside! I will say though, that the shade light - taupe shade with warm undertones is significantly darker than what is shown online. I attached a photo so you can see for yourself. I definitely suggest going a shade lighter than your usual shade or going in store to swatch and make sure you're getting your perfect match!"

It can’t be worn in the evenings if you plan on taking flash photography due to the SPF. I think because of the SPF, it’ll always stay at about 4 stars for me. A holy grail foundation for me is good for any time of day and for at least 12 hours of solid wear for really long days out."

It did not look or feel cakey/heavy/dry though. I am in my mid 30's and have slightly sensitive skin/ acne prone/ dry to combo skin type. I wasn't able to test this for very long or actually outside/working due to the awkward shade matching. But I wore it around the house for a while and had zero problems other than serious mismatch in shade.The shades online look and described to match my tone and typically other foundations described the same way usually do just fine, but this one was much darker. I couldn't even play around with it to correct with light concealer. It was just overly warm toned. I would've really liked to try this over a full day- esp while at work or in the sunlight, but It just didn't work out for me and Im a bit cautious to actually buy this in a lighter shade (there's only one more I think) without trying it first- due to the extreme warm tone. So I am slightly disappointed in this, I really wanted to genuinely try this because I constantly struggle to find a good foundation, and I know IT Cosmetics has amazing stuff. I received this product free for my honest review from BzzAgent."

Always the skeptic, I wasn't expecting anything spectacular.  To say that I was pleasantly surprised is a vast understatement!  While my skin is in good condition, as a middle aged woman that has spent most of my life outdoors, it's definitely seen its better days.  The IT Cosmetics CC+ has a perfect spreadable consistency - not too thick, not too thin.  It isn't goopy, chalky, oily or watery.  It has the feel of a quality moisturizing cream and travels across your skin like an eager tourist with sights to see. The formula settled into the surface of my skin and by the end of the day, it was still in the same place.  There was no sinking into my pores and no feathering into the fine lines around my eyes.  In addition, my other makeup products blended seamlessly into the CC+ cream and were still workable.  Over the past week, I have played with the CC+ cream and tried different things with it.  I've discovered that it's easy to use it as a lightweight tinted moisturizer, and that it is also buildable for use as a full coverage foundation.  While I don't have dark circles under my eyes very often, I do use a concealer on those days where sleep has been elusive the night before.  I was able to use the CC+ in place of a separate concealer, and also as a primer on my eyelids for shadow to rest on.  In both instances, there was minimal creasing at the end of the day.  Also, after gym time, patting my face with a damp cloth seemed to reset the product and it was good to go for another couple of hours.  The last test was how my skin felt after removing my makeup in the shower.  The IT Cosmetics CC+ did not leave my skin dry as many products do.  Highly recommend! I received the IT CC+ cream in Neutral Medium 12ML from Bzzagent in exchange for an honest review."

			"review_text": "I know this foundation has been a staple in the beauty space for years however I have yet to try it so when BzzAgent gifted this product free in exchange for my honest review I was excited to say the least.  This foundation is average. It isn’t too bad but it doesn’t preform as the brand describes.   Firstly the shade range is abysmal. They have many tone options in the fair shade range but few options for any other shades leaving many tone gaps and even shade gaps the deeper the foundations go.  For reference I am NC 25 but this foundation’s Light shade was too dark/pink. In theory it should be too light for me. But the next warm toned shade was also too dark, and the step lighter warm shade was ghostly pink. I almost never have issues choosing or companies providing my shade so I was a bit shocked.  The foundation is a slightly thick but creamy consistency making application with a beauty sponge a breeze. The formula feels comfortably hydrating on the skin. I would describe this as medium buildable coverage, you can still see some of your natural skin through this foundation so if you are truly looking for full coverage you will want to skip this one. This foundation played nicely with all of my other cream and powder products without issue.   Unfortunately in just a couple hours the foundation began to oxidize and only became more orange throughout the day. My skin is dry and I rarely have this issue with any foundation.   This foundation seems like hit or miss, if you are interested and can find a shade match, I would encourage you to try it and see how it works for you."

Surprised me because the consistency is on the thicker side compared to other liquid formulas I use. Coverage is good, I'd say in the medium range, evens skin tone and covers redness. There is a slight pleasant citrus scent but it's not overwhelming and doesn't linger. The couple cons: the shade fair light is a bit too dark but I made it work with a lighter powder on top. Imo the shade range leans very warm, especially since fair light is supposed to be cool lol. Also I'd recommend a pore filling/smoothing primer since this seems to slightly accentuate my pores and texture. This won't replace a moisturizer imo, like most other products it can show up dry patches. However it's not matte so if you're oily you'll need to set it. Overall not a bad choice if you're looking for a base"

In the end, it didn’t appear to dark. It gave me a nice color. It was creamy and blended well. I didn’t have a line of demarcation. There were no off putting scents.

I do feel like I get nice full coverage all day, when I use this product. And I am glad to have the sunscreen protection as I am very fair skinned. The only draw back is it can transfer off very easily so be careful if wearing white. I have attached a photo of wrong shade and one of same product in a different shade that matched me better. I feel like this product is very similar to a lot of products out there, and the price is pretty comparable to others as well. I would and do use this product already and will continue, just not in the shade I was given as it did not match me.

But then I really started looking for something to colour correct and this kept coming up in every Google search I did with my parameters. So I finally gave it a try, and was genuinely surprised by how great it actually is. It colour corrects beautifully, the colour match is bang on, it covers my rosacea marks and balances out the red when I'm having a flare up. I don't even need to use as much concealer as I did before. It's really full coverage for the most part.  I only gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because I wish that, for the price, the tube was bigger.

SPF is important to me and because it contains SPF 50, I don't have to worry about applying an additional sunscreen beforehand and it contains so many ingredients that are just overall good for your skin such as Niacinamide and Vitamin E so your complexion looks hydrated and even whenever you wear it.

Even though this should be my correct shade, I have considered trying a shade or two lighter, to see if it’s less orange on my skin. After applying the rest of my makeup, the foundation did look nice with a finished face, so it is a decent product, but it isn’t for everyone."

I can never go back to my old drug store brand! This stuff is worth every penny! I don't have acne or scars but do have uneven skin tone and texture. This CC+ Cream covers all of it leaving me with the perfect even looking complexion, without feeling heavy! Plus the best part is the added spf 50! I can now skip the extra step of adding sunscreen to protect my skin which sometimes causes slippage with my foundation and makeup. I highly recommend trying this foundation!"

I have tested it on my hand and you can clearly see how when I wiped it off it left a shadow so even thought I wanted to use it as contour the color was really deep so I couldn’t do that either, and as a last resort I decided to blend it with other foundations I had that were too light and that did work beautifully but I am just sad that I couldn’t enjoy it as intended.

The undertone was too warm for my skintone, but shade aside it was not a foundation I'd recommend to anyone with a similar skin type (combo skin/sensitive). The foundation wore well for the first few hours, but within about 3 hours it would look super greasy around most of my face, to the point that blotting/dusting powder on top would make it look cakey/blotchy. There was also no saving the foundation around my nose, it would break apart and sometimes get blotchy within 2 hours of putting it on. I emphasize this as it is currently winter when I got this foundation to test out, which means I would not trust this foundation in the spring/summer if it's becoming greasy in the winter. However, this foundation might be better suited for dry skin. It's not the worst foundation I've tried, but I've used many that are better suited for my particular skin. It does look nice on application but did not wear well for me after trying it with multiple primers underneath that I trust, and a few times without any primer."

There are some skin-treatment level ingredients in this including Hyaluronic Acid for hydration, Peptides to smooth and firm, and hydrolyzed collagen to plump skin.   There is also multiple botanicals, Niacinamide, Vitamin E, and SNAIL SECRETION FILTRATE. I love getting a skincare treatment level ingredient like Snail secretion filtrate in my daily foundation. It  makes skin look so much younger and healthier. It works on both my fine lines and my acne marks. It is rich in copper peptides, hyaluronic acid and amino acids so it hydrates and protects.   It is a full coverage level foundation suitable for covering acne marks and dark undereye circles.   The color correcting feature to add a brightening effect to skin without looking like a fake tan. If you are deciding between two shades, I would recommend the lighter of the two as it is highly pigmented and a small amount goes a long way."

It shares a lot of the features I like about my usual foundation, but has a good amount of additional coverage.  It feels good going on and doesn't sit too much on top of my skin which I have trouble with with so many fuller coverage products.  This is why I don't typically buy full coverage foundations, but this one did an excellent job. I typically buy two different shades, one for winter and one for summer since I tend to get a little bit of color on my face despite my best efforts.  I tried the shade medium and it was perfect for my summer skin.  I thought it would be since that's the same color I get in other IT Cosmetics products.  That isn't always true within brands, so I was pleased.  I also think their products have great wear time and don't settle into my fine lines around my eyes which is a must! Overall, I really liked this.  I will likely stick to my Bye Bye Foundation for everyday, but use this for going out/special occasions when I want more coverage.  I absolutely recommend their products.  I haven't tried anything I didn't like from them yet!"

It provides a natural finish that doesn't oxidize and change color throughout the day and it also doesn't pill; both of which are qualities that are absolute prerequisites for me. I do find that this foundation takes a while to dry down and it continues to feel slightly tacky to the touch throughout the day. Additionally, this foundation transfers (ie: to surgical masks, scarves, clothes, etc.). Unfortunately, the tackiness and transfer qualities both continue to occur even when using a setting powder (something I very much wish didn't occur). Overall, I really like this foundation and haven't found any other foundation that even comes close. I will definitely repurchase it, time and time again!"

It applied flawlessly, looked, and felt like skin! It's definitely a complete turnaround from the original IT cc cream I've tried in the past. This one melted into my skin, didn't make my pores look noticeable and over all, wore well throughout the day. There was a touch of creasing under the eye, but most likely because I don't use powder. If you don't like creasing under the eye, I'd set the under eye. Also, I'm 42, have fine lines and wrinkles under the eye, and this didn't settle in them surprisingly. I did have a dry patch between my eyebrows that it clung to slightly but was hardly noticeable. Overall, I was highly impressed with this product.

However, when I was testing it out for the first time one pump of this fully covered one-half of my face. So 2 pumps a day to cover my face is this is the only product I'm using or less than 1 pump if I'm just trying to cover my dark spots or discoloration. I also loved how moisturizing this product was without making my skin feel heavy or oily. After applying, it left my skin with a satin feel, so not matte or dewy. Lastly, as someone who is working on their hyperpigmentation and discoloration, I really appreciate that this CC cream includes SPF. When I wear makeup, it's hard to know when and how to put on the proper amount of SPF.

What I really like about this is even though it states full coverage, it's buildable to your liking. You can mix it with a bit of moisturizer for a lighter to med coverage or go for the complete full coverage. Either way it gives a beautiful finish. Because I have larger pores, I do need to use a pore filling primer before applying or I do find that it can settle. I also find that what gives me the best results is applying this right to my face in the areas I want coverage. I spread it slightly with my fingers before going in with a dense stippling brush, give my face a quick spritz with some stetting spray and then finish it up with a sponge. As long as I lock it all in with some more setting spray once I've finished my makeup, it lasts pretty much all day.  The only area it does transfer regardless is the bridge of my nose where my glasses rest. That's a problem for me no matter what foundation though so it's no big deal."

A little bit definitely goes a long way, and for me, using a foundation brush helped in the application and provided a flawless finish.   Personally, I need to do better in the color matching process because the color I selected was a little too light but with some tweaking I can still use it.

I would most definitely buy this product again as it is the best cc+ cream that I have ever tried and I’ve tried lots of them. The only thing I wish was that it was the right shade for my skin although I can still use this as a base for the rest of my makeup I wish that it actually matched my skin shade and I would really like for it to actually be full coverage the first time applying it even though I baby build it up into a full coverage I would say that it’s more of a medium to full coverage instead of actual full coverage.

I played around with it the next few uses and learned to let it sit after application and blending for a little bit to settle on my face and skin.  After that it was a night and day difference, and it instantly became my favorite foundation.  I will admit I'm not crazy about the smell of it, but it only smells just out of the tube.

I received a tube of this product to give an honest review on.   To start I will say that a little goes a long way! The first time I tried it I dispensed the 2 pumps the directions instruct you to do. That seemed to be way too much. It was very creamy, smooth and spread well, but I definitely did not need one to two pumps. That day my face felt too greasy for my liking and seemed to look a little too cakey. The next day I used it, I ended up depressing the pump not all the way down to dispense about 3/4 of a pump, and that seemed to be a good amount for me. That day my skin looked and felt a lot better. It does have a scent which is hard to describe, but almost is like mild minty or menthol type of scent which  actually was not displeasing to me, and seem to fade rather quickly.   The fact that it is creamy and provides full coverage would definitely be a pro in my opinion. The 1.08 oz tube for $44 does not contain very much, but since you really don’t need much that would seem to be a pro. However, in reading the directions for use, it  says to re-apply every two hours because it is also a sunscreen. This would be completely unaffordable to me personally, and would leave me looking way too cakey, and not feasible to re-apply if I had a full face of make up on. If I am going to have to re-apply lotion every two hours I think I would just stick with the Cerave light face lotion with spf  that I was already using. That  has the same instructions  for reapplication but contains almost twice the amount of product for a price point of $19 versus the $44 price point on the it cosmetics item. If  I were just planning on using it as more luxury primer/foundation/cc cream then I may be willing to treat it more as a splurge product  or if I were to see it on sale or if I had a c"

It's very hydrating, and even though I have combination skin in my t-zone, it didn't make my face any more oily. This CC+ Cream definitely does color correct but I would not say it's full coverage because it's thinner and lighter than other full coverage foundations that I have. It doesn't completely cover blemishes but does block most of the discoloration making it look less apparent. It's still a great foundation for everyday looks and those days where you want to use something easy. I would say this has a satin finish that makes your skin look natural."

I loved that it didn't break out my face in rashes, burns, or nothing like other foundations do to my face since I have really sensitive skin, I really love this foundation! I notice that the one I got was a little to dark for me, had to play with it to make it work, so i will make sure to get the next closer to my shade, beside this o recommend this, it will keep your face hydrated specially in the winter time, won't cake up or cause your skin to breakout and it will give you a nice coverage!"

			"review_text": "🧚🏻‍♀️ ✨ It Cosmetics CC+ Cream - Fair Ivory (W)  I received this product from It Cosmetics and Bzzagent in exchange for my honest review.  RATING: 4.0/5.0  ☀️ APPLICATION TIPS ☀️ Being light handed; a little goes a long way. Start with half a pump and only use more as needed. Press gently into the skin with a brush or sponge. I use the brand’s 115 brush.  ☀️ WEAR ☀️ I would consider this to have medium coverage. It feels lightweight and does excellent job of evening out skin tone. The finish is natural and leaves the skin glowing. I use a small amount of setting powder on my nose and chin to increase wear time. It will last 8 hours before requiring a touch up.  ☀️ INGREDIENTS ☀️ The formula is silicone-based, so keep this in mind if using a primer. Standout ingredients include snail mucin, hyaluronic acid, peptides, colloidal oatmeal, niacinamide, adenosine, and silk extract. There is a slight citrus smell from essential oils.  ☀️ COMMENTS ☀️ The shade range was expanded from 11 to 22 shades (still limited but a dramatic improvement). The darker shades use a chemical SPF to avoid white cast. There are travel sizes available. I tried the Fair (W) shade in the past and loved the formula, but I did not repurchase because it was too dark. Fair Ivory (W) is a much better match.  ☀️ CRITICISMS ☀️ Application method is crucial to avoid undesirable results. The formula is highly pigmented for a CC Cream and overuse results in a “cakey’ look. IT Cosmetics advertises this product as SPF 50, but no reasonable person would apply enough to achieve this level of protection. For this reason, I highly recommend using SPF under this product."

At first this foundation was looking a bit too dry and cakey around my mouth and it would melt so quickly on my forehead and nose sliding all over the place. I have to admit I wasn't a fan except for the fact the the coverage was beautiful initially and the SPF was a plus. As I started using it more and more and changing my skincare routine now I love it! I think it is important to note that you have to have a proper skincare routine in order for a makeup product to work for your skin type. Still to this day I only get about 4 to 5 hours of wear with this foundation and then it starts to wear off, but it wears off much more beautifully and fades naturally without me looking like a grease ball. I use this as an every day foundation for me. Like I said I LOVE the coverage. I don't like to show my natural freckles much so this covers them well and also any redness and discoloration I have. It looks healthy on my skin. The color looked a bit darker on the tube but it actually matched me very well. I am a light-medium usually with yellow-golden to olive undertones. It has a nice scent that is not too strong but pleasant and it applies so well and quickly with my foundation brush with no streaks too. It feels very lightweight as I buff it out which makes it perfect for every day use, personally.

It's more of a buildable coverage while being lightweight. I did only give 4 stars for coverage but that may also be due to the incorrect color choice on my end. Does have a light fragrance but not too overwhelming. Love that it does have SPF so no need to add sunscreen on in my routine which is nice!  I would still recommend this foundation though."

It Cosmetics partners with Plastic Surgeons & Dermatologists to develop their product line to give you a quality product. Thats a big win for me & only makes me want to buy everything It Cosmetics, & believe me I have a huge collection!!!  This It Cosmetics Color Correcting Full Coverage Cream is in shade Fair Beige. I love how the applicator tip twists giving me more movement. Having a pump dispenser helps keep things sanitary & for keeping in purse or traveling since theirs no lid to accidentally twist off. My first time using this product, I noticed a small amount goes a long, long way! One pump is more then enough for full face coverage. I wanted to apply this It Cosmetics Color Correcting Full Coverage Cream using different methods to see what gave me better results. I first tried applying with a beauty blender, & was shocked with the results! The texture felt creamy but also felt heavy on my face. It's like the product would lay on the surface of my skin & never absorb. And talk about wantjng to minimize the appearance of fine lines & wrinkles...This It Cosmetics Full Coverage Cream made my skin look years older!!!! I was able to see every single line & flaw since the product laid in my skin...talk about looking in the mirror & feeling depressed about yourself...  To quickly move on I wanted to try another method of application just with simply using my hands. I applied the same amount & began massaging the product into my skin. The results were a little better but I was still able to see a cakey residue on the surface of my skin along with some product that made my fine lines look more noticeable, which isn't the look I'm going for..."

And to set, I use a loose powder instead of a more full coverage powder foundation.   The benefit to owning this foundation is that it is perfect to use when you do not have much time to get ready. For me, applying by hand tends to work best. The warmth of my fingers allows the foundation to melt into my skin. I still get a bit oily, but I get oily with literally every foundation I've tried (and I've tried way too many to count).   Again, this can be a great product if you find a shade that matches and learn to apply way less than what you are probably accustomed to. "

This foundation leaves my skin feeling soft and also hydrated not too thick or clogging. I like that this foundation goes beyond color-correcting to include full coverage and anti-aging serum with mineral sunscreen all in one. I find that the IT Cosmetics CC + Cream Full-Coverage Foundation with SPF 50 + has worked much better than other foundations I have tried, but I should have chosen Rich Honey instead of Deep Honey. It states that the color is warm which is correct for me but this seems to have a tad bit of red in it but I can work with that. I find that this product has excellent benefits for me owning it because it is Full-Coverage, SPF 50, and the Anti-Aging Serum is a plus. I have highly recommended it already to many of my friends because they love the way it looked on me.  I would buy this product in a different shade and the only other con I have is the packaging. I am not a fan of the tub the top gets stuck and then with the pump products you end up leaving a lot of product in when it doesn’t pump out anymore.

It had almost an orange-y tint to it - like crappy self-tanners that can make someone light skinned like me look like an Oompa Loompa.  It other words, NOT flattering. To add injury to insult, it was so incredibly DRYING.  Yes my skin is dry (particularly in winter) but I use moisturizer & had done so right before I put the foundation on. I literally had to use water to get the foundation to move around on my skin enough so I wasn’t so orange-y.  This product left my skin feeling extremely dry & flaky on top of the orange-y tint. While this product may work for some, I would not recommend for those who are fair-skin toned. So disappointed because I’ve liked IT Cosmetics in the past, but this one did not measure up."

Despite receiving the light variant, it does not color match my skin, too dark. It goes on pretty smooth with no clumps but does streak a bit. It did not blend well trying to prevent makeup lines.  IT Cosmetics CC+ Cream Full-Coverage Foundation with SPF 50+ lasted all day with minimal lines showing at the end of my day."

It is a buildable formula that covered my hyperpigmentation and dark circles really well.  I was impressed with the coverage it offered without looking or feeling cakey.  I also loved the added SPF 50, that doesn’t leave a white cast. I usually forget to put mine on so that sealed the deal.  It has an anti-aging, hydrating serum that leaves my face feeling hydrated and smooth. In the end you get a natural finish with a no makeup, makeup look.  It made my skin look like skin even with foundation on. CC creams contain pigments that specifically target discoloration. I would recommend this to anyone dealing with redness, acne scars, blemishes, uneven skin texture, or hyperpigmentation. I believe anyone who tries this for themselves will definitely find it worth the price."

I prefer mineral powder products on my skin. I found this CC cream to break up and look patchy throughout the day when worn with my usual spf underneath. When I tried wearing the foundation without any spf products it looked and wore much better. I personally don't rely on spf that is included in foundation for my sun protection. Having melasma has taught me that I need sunscreen and lots of reapplying especially in the summer. I don't hate this product but overall I feel it's a bit overhyped.

If you are looking for a foundation that can be layered for light to full coverage and want to prevent sun damage, this is a great choice!"

When I apply bronzer on top of the cc cream foundation, it gives me the right complexion. I didn't have any breakouts or white cast on my skin. This cc cream foundation stays on my skin all day, and there wasn't a huge transfer , once my face was sprayed with setting spray. Lastly this CC cream foundation has SPF 50+, which protects the whole face in the sun. And gets anyone in the habit of wearing SPF, without adding it as an extra step!"

			"review_text": "I’d been wanting to try this for a LONG time, but the lightest shade wasn’t light enough for my fair skin so I was excited they came out with more shades! I got “Fair Beige.” I can make it work but it’s darker than it appears in the swatches here. But, I love this enough to get it again & then I’ll get “Fair Porcelain.” I have a photo of swatches of the It Fair Beige shade next to the 2 shades I have in the Elf Camo CC cream. Elf Light 203N was too dark & I had to use a mixer to lighten it. Elf Fair 125C works well for me. As you can hopefully tell in the swatches, the It shade is slightly darker than Elf 125C, but not as dark as Elf 205N.  This has SPF 50. But, I never look to my foundation to provide me with my SPF…nobody should. You’re never going to apply enough foundation to get the stated SPF so you should always apply a separate SPF. But, I don’t mind the extra layer of protection.   This is a thicker consistency, but creamy & glides onto the skin easily. It applies well with a brush & sponge. With a sponge, 1 thin layer gives medium coverage & a 2nd thin layer gives full coverage. With a brush, 1 thin layer gives almost full coverage (doesn’t completely cover my sun spots but close), & a 2nd thin layer over my sun spots gives complete coverage. It doesn’t look or feel heavy on the skin.   I have normal to dry skin, more on the dry side with some extremely dry areas. This has a nice finish, not completely matte but not dewy either. If I don’t give it time to set on its own (10-15 min) it transfers unless set with powder. If I don’t let it set on its own or set it with powder, I can’t apply powder products over it as smoothly as I’d like. But, I’ll usually just apply cream products instead so I get nice application & setting spray to set everything in place. It lasts all day without transferring/fading. If I have the time to let it sit powder products apply nicely & with setting spray it lasts all day without transferring or fading."

Not cakey at all. I feel like my face had an extra layer of moisturizing.  Since it is winter in NY, there are not many sunburn opportunities but I still feel protected from UVA/UVB. The product comes in a pump tube applicator, which is so much better than the squeeze tube.   I’m happy with this brand and product because it does not contain bismuth oxychloride (I am allergic to that). Many make-up brands contain bismuth oxychloride, which made it hard for me to follow a make-up routine until IT Cosmetics came along.

I found this product stays on great because I was only able to remove with my makeup remover which is another plus because I hate buying products that come off easily.

I prefer CC+ Nude Glow Lightweight Foundation + Glow Serum. I won't be purchasing this foundation but I would recommend to others."

I have noticed as I’ve gotten older my skin has been changing, products I’ve used in the past no longer work for me. I came across color correction for full coverage cream and I absolutely love it! This was my first time using color corrective in aging age hydrating serum and nothing else compares.  I’m now over 50 and  as my skin changes with age I’m seeing I need a quality product like this.   What I love about this product is the color coverage. I live in Arizona which can get extremely hot in the summer.  I’m loving the SPF 50 clear sunscreen which is great for summer. After trying this make up I will definitely switch brands.   I would definitely buy this product. I’m glad I stepped out of my comfort zone and tried something new."

The consistency of the foundation came out irregularly with what looked like unblended ingredients caught up in the formula. Once I mixed it up I started to lightly apply it around my face but noticed the formula dried pretty quickly.   Maybe I just got a bad batch? But this low quality was surprising coming from IT."

It does feel super light weight on my skin and non greasy which I love. I would continue to purchase this foundation and maybe play with some different shades to see what matches better or use two different shades to help with the dark spots.

The color light seemed a bit dark for my light-medium skin tone,  but it works nonetheless. I used a damp sponge to apply, and it went on nicely,  although I did feel it looked a bit too dark for my skin coloring, and my taste.  Additionally,  I felt that it accentuated skin texture and fine lines.

The foundation went on really nice over my skincare products and didn’t settle in my fine lines , wrinkles and next to my nose like so many do. I love that this foundation is buildable for a medium to full coverage application, I love the tube it comes in for easy dispensing. I love that it’s skincare , a CC cream , SPF and foundation in one that’s really affordable. It covered my redness on my cheeks and nose , and hid some of the darkness under my eyes. While trying this product I didn’t use any concealer , powder or setting spray just to see how it done on it’s own…honestly in the picture below I was just getting ready for bed and in my Pajamas getting un-ready so I could show how it looked after about 10hrs of wear. I feel like I definitely need to buy the IT Cosmetics Bye Bye Under-eyes to get more coverage for my dark circles and sometimes puffiness, but don’t feel like I needed to touch-up the foundation.

So the second time I tried it, I went with one of my favorite primers, and it looked perfect. It also built up nicely with no streakiness or cakeyness. I loved how it looked. The third time I used a different primer, but was also one of my go-tos. Again, it looked ok but wasn’t great. This seems to be a product you have to baby, and will only look good if paired with the right primer. For someone who wears the exact same pre-makeup skincare and primer every day, and it works with that, then you’re golden. I switch mine up depending on what my skin needs that day, so it’s going to take more time to figure out for someone like me, and I won’t be able to wear it with certain primers.  But, with that being said, when it’s the right base, it’s fantastic. It looks natural, even built up to a full coverage. The primer it worked great with (for me) is the pink elf power grip. I’ll also add that the shades match the description very well. I chose mine online and ended up with a perfect match."

This cc/foundation is my NEW GO TO!!! I absolutely love it and the way it makes my skin feel. I think the thing that I love the most is that an only used a small drop and it covered my entire face!

I am always cautious to try foundations because I am scared that the company will not offer colors for darker skin tones.

On my first application I only colored half of my face and was able to clearly see that the product matched. I was also able to see that my discolored spots were covered despite a light application of the product.  The product was easy to apply. I only used my fingers for quick coverage on the go. I would probably use a sponge if I was going to blend the foundation with additional products or was using a blush or contour. I like that a strong spf was included. That limits the number of products that I have to layer onto each other.   The coverage is not matte. My skin was shiny after application.

I prefer products with little to no fragrance. I applied this product over moisturized skin and a primer.

The product applied easily; however, within just a few hours the product had begun to oxidize on my skin leaving an orange fake tan look.

My skin is combination normal to oily so I usually powder to set it in place but it still looks pretty glowy even after powdering.  When I powder, it doesn’t crease and it lasts up most of the day without using a primer.  I don’t think I would be able to wear it without powdering because it does feel a little greasy and heavy if I don’t.  It does get a bit shiny after 6 hours of wear but when I take it off it leaves my skin feeling hydrated and it doesn’t break me out so that is a plus.  I like that I can sheer it out using a sponge for lighter coverage.  I wouldn’t use this for any special occasions because I would prefer something that could stay on longer with more coverage and without having shine break through, plus the high SPF could cause flashback but I would recommend it as a great every day coverage product that is super user friendly and provides a little extra sun protection."

I did like that it smells so clean and doubles as a sunscreen. Always a plus! The color matched me pretty well. I also like that it sets very beautifully and lasts for hours at a time. My face felt light and never greasy. These are musts for me. I would definitely purchase this product in the future and I recommend as well.

I have the medium coverage version in tan rich but somehow this looks a bit darker. Maybe that’s just because of the coverage difference. But other than that I like it. It smooths the look of my skin and mostly covers my blemishes. Haven’t really found that magic that truly covers my dark spots but this is still a great foundation.

			"review_text": "Thank you BzzzAgent and IT Cosmetics for my free sample in exchange for my honest review. First my holy grail foundation is Estée Lauder Doublewear. I have been wearing that foundation for over 29 years and normally when I try other foundations, I am disappointed. I have mature oily but dehydrated skin with dark spots, freckles, and hyperpigmentation and fine lines, smile lines. No texture, but enlarged pores on my cheeks, so a foundation has some challenges to work through. This foundation was a pleasant surprise. I like the foundation has sunscreen, but I still use my own prior to using this for more coverage. I like the squeeze tube with a pump, it makes traveling with it easy.. This foundation has a scent of sunscreen. I received color light beige which is a bit too light for me, but I still used his looking to see performance. I can truly get to full coverage with this foundation better than my Estée Lauder. I tried this on my face.. one side straight out of the pump on bare skin. The other side with my full routine with multiple serums, moisturizer, sunscreen, and primer. This clearly needs primer at a minimum. The side on bare skin settled into my pores, smile lines, and looked shiny and cakey at the end of her day. The side with all my skincare, I was shocked how good it looked, no settling into smile lines and did good job on my pores. Using this as a concealer with fine lines, not a good idea on either side, it settled right into all my under eye fine lines. I truly enjoy this foundation and makes my pores look great and even gives my skin a youthful look. The coverage is truly full compared to Estee Lauder with less product. I use two pumps to get full coverage on the entire face. I do have to set this foundation because it never dries down on me. I want to try this in Texas heat, NY winter this held up with no issues. I will purchase this in the correct color. What I have done is mix this with my Estée Lauder foundation to make it blend into my skin bett"

It is very full coverage and it covered all of my blemishes. I also love the fact that it has sunscreen in it. It is so lightweight, I felt like I wasn't wearing foundation at all. I absolutely love this foundation. This one is my new favorite go to foundation. Out of all the others I have tired, this one goes above and beyond my expectations. I will definitely recommend this to family and friends. And I will be buying this foundation as a new addition to my daily makeup routine."

			"review_text": "I was given this to try for review purposes, but my thoughts are my own. This is the CC cream that you want in your arsenal! Full coverage? Yes! Satin finish? Yes! High SPF? Yes! Long lasting? Ehh, not on me. It is also finicky with what you layer with it underneath. I have oily skin and even in the winter time, it is that way. Day 1, I used my Bobbi Brown Vitamin Face Base and Mehron Colorset setting powder and nope, slid right off after 2 hours. Day 2, tried it with the La Roche-Posay Toleriane Double Repair UV SPF30 Moisturizer, Milk Hydro Grip Primer and the Mehron Colorset powder, got a good 5 hours before touching up. Just to test a theory, I tried it just with the Milk Hydro Grip Primer to see if it just works without a moisturizer or anything like that to assist it and I got a solid 7 hours out of it. So, that tells me it works best by itself with a primer. I found a beauty blender/sponge gives the best smooth and effortless application, but a brush also works as well. Great option for the everyday gal or guy that wants that all in one hard worker that looks good for work but also for the busy life as well! But, I do think that the ELF CC cream (which I do own as well) is a great inexpensive alternative if you cannot get your hands on it!"

It has phenomenal coverage and is buildable. It feels really light on my face. I am able to leave it as is, or add concealer and bronzer/contour if I’d like. You do not need to put powder over this, where’s foundation, and other BB and CC creams require a bit of powder to stop from creasing and shining. As far as wear test, it held up my entire workday, which is from 8 am into the evening. I have combination oily and dry skin, more so on the oily side, so I hate shining. Hyaluronic acid helps with oil-control by keeping your face moisturized, not needing to produce as much sebum, and it helps to hydrate dry skin.  I would definitely recommend this product to my friends and family who want something to make their face even-toned, light, and great skin-care benefits. If you are a full-coverage foundation-wearer, this pairs well with foundation! I used it alone and with foundation and I enjoyed both looks! But if you want this product to replace foundation-looks, I would say stick to foundation because BB and CC creams are not meant to be as full-coverage as foundation. They are meant to have greater skincare impact than coverage. This product does cover up scars ad I have melasma, which is extremely deep hyperpigmentation that is symmetrical on the face. Something that covers that is a great product! I would recommend to users who wear makeup daily and those who want a makeup look occasionally."

For reference, I have dry/combo skin with some fine lines and wrinkles (I’m 43.)  The cream itself is fairly thick but still spreads/applies well. I used a brush to apply and 3 small pumps gave me full, but light, face coverage. I was able to build it up as the dry-down is really slow. I didn’t get any pills from the product underneath as I was applying more, either.   One thing I didn’t like was that it moves a bit too easily. If I apply a little too much pressure in an area, the foundation will move/come off as it didn’t seem to dry down at all. This foundation *definitely* needs to be set with a powder. It will also settle in lines if not set immediately over any wrinkles/creases.  The finish is a satin, so if you wanted to apply without setting and don’t have any lines to worry about, it will be dewy but not greasy-looking. I like that there are skincare ingredients and also the SPF 50!  The color/undertone match was pretty darn good. I am a fair neutral so I have a hard time with color and undertone matching. I chose Fair Porcelain and it was light enough for me without going too pink or beige. (I tried an IT Cosmetics powder foundation years ago and their lightest shade was still too dark, so bravo for expanding your shade range!)  To wrap up, I have to say that I liked the full coverage and the color/undershade was pretty great so I will for sure be using this one up (making sure to apply/set, apply/set)."

I have oily skin and it wore really really well throughout the day. I am pleasantly surprised and will probably make this my everyday foundation."

My first impression of the foundation was it felt lightweight and a little goes a long way. As I applied the cc cream I noticed it didn't smell bad also. So my skin type on my face is oily/combination so my go-to is a matte look. My suggestion is if you are like me and enjoy a matte look get blotting paper or matte translucent powder to help accomplish that effect. Compared to some other over-the-counter creams I enjoy the durability of the product It really lasted all day during my physical activities. I would recommend you to buy it. If my review has helped you and you would like me to review more with or for you it's Badgaljodi on all socials 🫶"

This CC cream is supposed to be full coverage on the skin and is an anti-aging hydrating serum. Most excitingly, it is SPF 50+. The coverage did not disappoint! It applied to my skin well and did a good job at covering my dark marks. It wasn’t to oily or greasy and kind of dried down a bit after application. I have no issues with the foundation and the coverage itself. What I am concerned about is that this foundation states it is flammable. Why is this foundation flammable?? I have never heard of that before. I love IT cosmetics but What is in this foundation that makes it flammable until dry?"

I broke out terribly after using this, and I noticed the ingredients had several types of oil, dimethicone, etc. I usually break out from silicone, but maybe this has to many different types of oils. I will try again once my acne heals, but it's been a week and the acne is still clearing up. I hope it wasn't this CC cream because I really like it."

I generally use it during the day when I’m going outside as it has the SPF. It hasn’t given me any side effects as my skin can be a little sensitive, no redness or tingling which was a great factor for me. I will definitely keep using this as we go into the warmer weather and will change out the color to a darker tone.

I even used a good setting spray and that helped some but it still transferred a bit. As long as you don't hug anyone or anything this foundation is awesome. There are many shades to choose from and seems like they keep adding more just to make sure everyone's perfect shade is available. I love this because I feel no one should have to buy more than one shade and mix and match just to get their shade. This is a very buildable formula for medium to full coverage.

I used it years ago but at the time the shade range was very limited and there wasn't a shade that matched me well.  Fast forward to now and IT Cosmetics has expanded the shade range so that more people can finally try this!  There's now a color that actually works for me so it's been fun revisiting it.   It's a slightly thicker formula that applies equally well with a sponge or brush and it WILL absolutely provide coverage.  I see this working better for those with dry skin (like myself) than for people who have oily skin simply because it does also provide more hydration than a lot of formulas.   It can look a little heavy if overapplied so less is more with this.  It meshes well with my typical powders, cream products, etc and it provides a little bit of extra SPF (which some people will appreciate, others won't) in addition to the daily sunscreen that I use. Overall it's a solid formula which is why it's stuck around for years and years and while it's probably more suitable for some skintypes than others, it's definitely worth trying."

The only issue I had with this foundation is that the color Rich that I got was too dark for me, it left my skin looking orange. I have been using this as a base and then a lighter foundation on top to highlight and cover a bit of the orange color. I did try this alone and it just feels amazing, it's very hydrating and even though I have oily skin it didn't make my face any more oily. I am normally a neutral/beige shade and the shade Rich will work great for me during the summer. This CC+ Cream definitely does color correct but I would not say it's full coverage because it's thinner and lighter than other full coverage foundations that I have. It's doesn't completely cover acne scars but does block some of the color of scars making it look more natural skin. It's still a great foundation for everyday looks and those days where you want to use something not too heavy. I would say this has a satin finish that makes your skin look like skin even with this foundation. I recommend for anyone as it also offers SPF! I am actually purchasing a lighter shade just to use now during winter months and using the Rich shade for summer."

The SPF 50+ protection is important to me as well since I already have some sun damage to my face and want to prevent more.  Since I have very dry skin I apply some light moisturizer first and then use this CC+ cream so I have a fresh look that lasts all day.  I highly recommend it!"

I often have to do that with other so called full coverage foundations.  The formula is smooth, hydrating & has a slight greasy feeling when first putting it on. BUT what is amazing is once you have it all blended there is absolutely no greasy feeling at all. My feels smooth, my pores had disappeared & I had a nice finish. The finish is definitely not matte but it is not dewy either. It is what I guess I would call slightly dewy.  I did have to do quite a bit of blending with a brush & cosmetic sponge to get the foundation even all over my face. The color I chose (light) was a tad bit orangey for my liking so I really had to blend around my hairline, etc. to get it evened out & natural looking. Once I did that it looked great. I may choose a slightly different color or tone next time.  The foundation stayed put all day. I was amazed how great it still looked when I went to wash my face at bedtime. This is almost never the case with even high end foundations I use.  The 2 only negatives to the product are…  The 1st is a very slight odor when you first put on the product. I am assuming this is the SPF. It goes away rather quickly once you start blending & in no way did I notice it as I wore the product throughout the day.   The 2nd is I have acne prone skin & I am very sensitive to foundations, serums, etc. When I used this foundation I broke out around my mouth & nose. This is what happens when my skin says I don’t like what you are putting on me. I decided to ride it out & my skin cleared up in a couple days & I am no longer breaking out. So, I think my skin just reacted to the change in product.   Overall, this is an excellent foundation that provides great coverage. I highly recommend trying it."

For the money it will last me more than a year even used on a day to day basis. Worth every penny and recommended for any and everyone. Its best for sensitive, acne prone skin as well. My skin is super oily  and it works very well on me."

The shade they sent me was not the right shade at all HOWEVER I have actually been using this foundation (in my shade) for almost 2 years now and I love it. It's so thick that I immediately thought oh no this is going to be terrible and cakey and so full coverage that my skin can't even breathe but that isn't true at all. It's definitely more coverage than I expected from a cc cream but I'm happy with it. It smoothes out easily, doesn't feel heavy on the face, wears well, doesn't turn into an oil slick or break up. I'm a huge fan. I've repurchased this twice since the first time I used it."

After opening the package, I was impressed with the simplicity of the silver and black CC+ packaging. I was even more excited to see that I was sent the color deep which seemed to match my skin tone pretty well. However, I quickly learned the top just pops off instead of having to be unscrewed, but, on the bright side, it only took two full pumps for the product to start flowing. Upon application, the product applied smoothly with just my fingerprints, while providing a medium to full coverage, with just one pump. However, the shade was a bit too dark for me in the winter time and would be a better fit for my skin tone during the summer months. Overall, I really like the product and would recommend this product to others."

If I use one pump of the foundation, I get medium coverage that feels very lightweight, but you can build up to high coverage which is nice as well. It blends into the skin beautifully, and my skin doesn’t get oily nearly as fast as normal. I also haven’t noticed any new breakouts since starting to use this. My only warning is that I would shade match in a store as the online photos are a bit misleading. Other than that I have no complaints about this foundation and have already recommended it to others."

First off, I like the packaging which is easy and convenient to use and carry. I got the best results by using 2 thin layers of one pump each (each pump is a very small amount) and blending with a standard makeup sponge. The coverage is definitely plenty for me, but I could have probably used more product if I'd wanted a more perfect look. The feel of the product was a little too moist and heavy for my combination leaning oily skin, I usually prefer a product that dries down more and is more budge proof. It also had a bit of a look at me, I'm a layer of makeup look, but it might just be that the color is a tiny bit too light for me. Overall I do like this product and will continue to use it, but it's not quite my HG. In the pics, one is of my bare skin and the other is with just the foundation and no other products."

I couldn't see the name of the color on the package (the writing was far too small) but I think it was Deep Mocha. My complexion is medium brown. When I saw a photo of the colors, the product appeared to be the right one for my skin tone but I was mistaken.  The color, which I thought was a nice, rich brownish tone, was much more reddish—almost burgundy and it looked that way on my skin! There was no way I could leave the house without blending it with other colors to make myself look less clownish.  Overall, I’m not sure if I’d try this product again. The shade was so glaringly off that I’m not sure if I’d trust trying any others. There are many other foundations that work better for me at a much lower price."

It looks like it has a bit of an orange undertone out of the tube. I like how this foundation felt on my skin, very light. It did not cover my under eye darkness.  It does transfer onto clothing. A setting spray or powder should help that. Wearing a primer under it might also help. It was not drying, and felt good on my skin all day. It's buildable for more coverage. It has a light smell but nothing flowery or over powering. A little goes a long way. One drop spread over my whole face. I think the price is too high for this size tube. It's nice to have the SPF 50+ in it. Overall I would purchase this again. Nice to see more inclusive shades for women of color of all skin tones."

I have a medium to med-light, (not fair), skin tone with a warm complexion and combination skin which is showing the signs of aging.   I prefer using a full coverage foundation with long wear time and a shade that is complimentary to my natural skin tone ans complexion.   This shade, of MEDIUM, compliments my natural skin tone and blends seamlessly, leaving me with a gorgeous natural finish! It is warm undertones and a so soft shade!  With over 20 shades to choose from and new ones being added often there certainly something to make you say oh lala!   This Full-Coverage CC+ Cream with SPF 50+, is actually moisturizing. It  hydrates my skin without being oily and is not a heavy on the skin beauty product.   It gives my skin, the coverage I want, without having the dreadful cakey  look or skin smothering feel. All of my other cosmetics apply smoother, without leaving unwanted creasing or settling in the pores. I have to mention the SPF 50+ protection that this CC cream alone offers my skin! Highly recommended & extremely impressive!"

			"review_text": "Years ago, I remember when this brand debuted and all the gurus were talking about this foundation; I tried a sample of it and I wasn't that impressed... fast forward to 2023 and I don't know if they improved their formula or what but the coverage is miles better and the finish is just beautiful.  For the price; you get incredible skincare benefits; sun protection (a definite must for me) and an array of shades to cover most skin tones... it was always hard for me to find the perfect match and this foundation has it (I wear Fair Beige) and I'm really light with pink/rosy undertones; this is the closest I've gotten to a perfect match; even with my beloved Tarte foundations; this is miles ahead when it comes to undertone for me.  Coverage wise; I would say its a high medium but can be built to full coverage as the bottle would suggest. The wear time for me (given my oily skin) can last me the 8 hour workday if I set with powder; otherwise it will last me for about 6; sometimes 5 depending on the humidity in my area and what I'm doing. I would recommend setting with powder unless you have very dry skin. This is a very moisturizing formula luckily so your skin will definitely feel nourished.   It doesn't oxidize like so many foundations can do; and if you want a great alternative to Charlotte Tilbury; this is the foundation to get. It's very similar to foundations that cost triple the price but it covers better. If you don't want to pay the full price though; they offer this in a convenient travel size which is great and very affordable!  A little bit goes a long way; I use about two pumps for high coverage and about one pump for lighter coverage; sometimes I'll mix in a glowy primer and then apply it so I can get the light coverage but still get that pretty glow I want.  Overall, this is a great foundation. It's a great gift I received and it's definitely one that has become a holy grail for me. Get this! you won't regret it :)"

The finish has a bit of  a skin like sheen and the coverage i’d say is medium and buildable, I have rosacea and it did actually cover it —but i’d still build on top of problem areas with concealer.

It works fine as a foundation if you want to go through the extra effort, but it’s honestly the worst of both worlds in terms of CC cream & full coverage foundation. I recommend mixing it with a light moisturizer and/or using it for spot coverage if you’re going for a fresh-faced look (which is why I’d bought it).   Also, be sure to wash off every ounce of this stuff if you have any kind of acne. Like, double cleanse even if that’s not your thing. Knocking two stars for those reasons. Would give four stars if it wasn’t marketed as a CC cream on the packaging. It really does provide coverage & I love how the formula feels. Whatever the heck “CC+ Cream Full Coverage Foundation” is supposed to mean just translates into “We tried!” in application though."

I purchased a full size a few days ago and realized it makes my fine lines look deeper which I suspect it's because of absorbing all the moisture from my skin. I'm torn now. Sweaty summer days when you need more protection or cloudy winter days when your skin asks for more moisturizer?"

I put under my foundation and it just creates the most even skin tone. I bought the IT brush to apply but it just doesn’t work for me. Instead, I use a slightly damp beauty blender to apply it and blend it out. Start in the area that needs most coverage and start fanning out from there. Less is more and it’s completely buildable. Let it dry before putting anything else over top or before setting if that’s all you’re putting on for the day. Lastly, I find the shades a bit darker. For instance light-medium is my go to everywhere else but was too dark for me in winter. I’m finding light is a shade I can get away with in all seasons, especially with foundation over top. Give it a try but be patient with it!"

I had never found a foundation that I would buy after using the bottle up until a girl came into my work and her skin looks so flawless I had to ask her what she was wearing. When she recommended this foundation along with the it cosmetics powder I went to Sephora right after work and bought some. I have fair skin with a neutral/warm undertone and always had trouble finding a shade that wouldn’t make me look either yellow or too pale. The lightest shade in this range has always done the trick and gives a healthy color to my skin and pretty glow while looking very natural. I’m so glad I took that girl on her recommendation, I’ve use this foundation ever since then I always buy a new bottle once I’m out. I’ve recommended this foundation to my sisters and a few friends and they all love it too. I get compliments all the time about how I have naturally beautiful and even skin, which isn’t true at all but this foundation really makes it look like I do.

That being said, the CC cream is VERY heavy compared to that one, despite LOOKING very similar. It's also very drying compared to that one as well. But my biggest issue with IT Cosmetics are their SHADES. In particular, their light shade. As others have stated, this is NOT LIGHT. This light will ONLY work if you are self tanning. But the bigger issue, is that it's also very GRAY. Notice that they give it away in their OWN description by saying it's taupe. Look up the shade taupe. It says it's a gray-brown color. NOT very flattering! I like their Light Medium better, in the Bye Bye foundation in particular, but sadly it oxidizes too pink/orange for me, even though it looks great when I first put it on. But at least it's not gray like their light is... not as dark either! But a lot of the darkness in this shade stems from it being too dull/gray. So unless IT Cosmetics can get their act together and start making more REALISTIC shades, I won't continue to buy foundations from them. Also, this foundation (as well as ALL their products) are nearly IMPOSSIBLE to get out of things. Literally it can't be done. That's why I've resorted to using disposable makeup sponges when using any of their products. So that's another thing to keep in mind. And if you DO attempt to get this out of a brush or sponge, you will need about 4 different cleansers and even then there will likely be residue. Yes, it's that bad!"

I was colour matched by a Sephora employee and she nailed it on the first try. Meanwhile I had been struggling for months trying to find the correct shade of concealer and foundation. I appreciate that this has spf in it, and has a natural finish. It even did a good job at covering my under eyes, I just pressed what was left over on my brush under my eyes. The tube appears to be very small but one full pump was enough to cover my whole face AND neck. Have a light hand and build as necessary! I pair it with the Fenty cream blush and cream bronzer and I find that it stays in place very well. (I apply those with my fingers). 4 stars because I find that this does settle into pores and under the eye creases, not horribly but it does require some tapping after a couple hours. I’m looking for a primer to hopefully counter that."

However, throughout the day, it slides with sweat (even with powder) and cakes at the same time, so I need to check-up on the makeup frequently. I will say, I have not yet found a foundation or CC+ cream that works perfectly with my skin. This one does a decent job overall, I would still buy it again."

I thought it was a sure thing given the description and most of the reviewers.  Then after I confirmed the color choice, I figured  I’d use the tester for a couple more days before I buy it. Sadly, by the 5th day of daily use, my skin started breaking out. I immediately stopped using it. Then the following days the break out worsen, my skin has uncomfortable and somewhat disgusting texture. I’m sooo disappointed and upset. It’s been 4 days since I stopped using it and every day the condition of my skin is worse. I hope it wears of sooon. I concluded that this is not oily skin nor acne prone skin friendly product as claimed !"

I am a pretty pale baby for a Latina. I normally wear light foundation but this matched me to neutral medium and that was wayyy to dark for me. I then got a new one after a year and purchased the light but that is still way to dark on me and I wear a 2n1 In Estée Lauder double wear and 185 in fenty soft matte. I hate looking orange but I love the way this makes my skin feel and it doesn’t irritate or cause acne for me just wish the shade range was better. I think I’m going to try adding an adjust pigment to it to see if I can make it work and try the shade fair next which is crazy that it’s the lightest shade. I am neutral skin toned too so things go super pink Or super orange on me if they don’t match. For skin prep I wear glow recipe watermelon moisturizer underneath and then go in with it cosmetics primer for pores and Hydration. I think you can prob get away without primer but I’m extra like that and feel that it helps my foundation look and last longer. I also use Charlotte tilbury powder when I Want to stay dewy or I use hourglass powder. Laura Mercier gets too heavy and also Causes acne for me. I then spray with Charlotte Tilbury setting spray and it holds well but be ready to be dewy with this cc cream. I wouldn’t  recommend this for oily skin."

It's my current favourite as a base for more complex fun looks. I don't think the skincare products in this do much for my skin, but that's not what I look for in a base anyways. I don't use primer with this and it lasts all day on me when I wear it out. It does transfer on my mask though so I only wear disposable ones when I go out. There is a scent and I don't mind it too much, but I wish it wasn't there. I have dry, sensitive skin and it doesnt irritate it or look too drying or glowy on me.

The lightest shade available, supposedly “fair light,” is incredibly orange on me. It’s probably 3-4 shades darker than my skin tone. So I either need to have a fake tan for it to match me, or I have blend it all the way down my neck and even my chest sometimes. I don’t know how they can call that FAIR LIGHT.  So, If they offered more accurate shades, this would be an A+, amazing foundation.  I know they are able to go that light, as I also have the “your skin but better foundation” in a fair and that shade is a perfect match."

I don’t know what witchcraft this is but I always receive comments when I wear this and people ask me if I have Botox or who my esthetician is. I would recommend testing in store because the colors don’t necessarily match the description online, but if you do find the right shade this is a 10/10 holygrail product"

When blending out, the product quickly turned orange! It also clings to dry spots, giving the effect of some sort of sickly pumpkin. Will immediately be returning. This is definitely not for fair skin tones. I'm not sure if the formula would work with any tone if they have dry skin. With such a limited shade range, no true fair shade and no true dark shade, it feels like a rushed job."

I know it takes some time for your skin to adapt to new products so I continued to use this product for about a week but the breakouts continued on the forehead and chin , so I took a break for a couple Weeks and then decided to give it one more try so I did use it for another week and the breakouts returned on the chin and forehead so I had to stop using it. For reference I use the too faced born this way foundation and have used this for years and have never had any issue with breakouts or looking greasy so it must be something in this product that caused breakouts :(."

I think it is a great start foundation for someone who wants to work towards wearing a full base that has buildable coverage and know your skin is protected."

The reason I keep coming back to this cream is because results are consistent, it always looks nice, doesn’t make my face look oily or dry, doesn’t breakdown weirdly throughout the day and plays nice with ANY sunscreen! I think I figured out how this manages to always look the same, it’s because it is a cream and not a liquid. It already has built in skincare in it that makes it glide across the skin. Whereas liquid formulations are so thin they are affected by the type products you put under them, oil vs oil free moisturizer, mineral vs chemical sunscreen, primer etc."

This is what I do to make this foundation work: Prep the skin with a face oil, then use a bit less than one pump of this foundation and blend out with a wet beauty blender (foundation brush just made it so darn cakey for me. oh man). When done blending out I'll use the clean side of the beauty blender to sheen out the areas under my eyes or where I have more visible pores because these areas I found would look the most cakey after the foundation dried down. Spray with Mac Fix+ and tap in Milk Blur stick with fingers in the areas I don't want to be super shiny. I gave one less star because the colour selection is really not that great.

I used a pea size dot, applied with my fingers, didn’t use ANY powder, had this on for about 12 hours and my dry skin looked flawless all day. It looked like I wasn’t wearing any make up too. I was shocked. Love the ingredients too and added SPF. Can’t imagine anything better for my skin during these coming summer months."

I wanted so badly for this to be the holy grail in my daily makeup routine, in which I have worked so hard on my skincare but still need a little coverage.

I was shocked when I opened the new box because I thought I ordered the wrong shade- the lack of range in their shades is inexcusable at this point with other brands having a full spectrum for more skin tones, especially because this product is full coverage and the colour is really visible on your face. I have a soft spot for it because of the fantastic formula and the fact that it was the first foundation I purchased but what's the point if there isn't a shade that I can even wear?

No breakouts, and it looks and feels great on my skin. The tube will last a long time, because you only need one pump to cover your face. It is very full coverage, so I recommend using a damp sponge. I spread it over my face then go over it with the sponge, but you can try dotting it on. I especially love how it even almost completely obscures my dark undereye circles. I can't overstate how much I love this stuff! One caveat...you're going to need more than a makeup wipe to get your face clean. I recommend a oil-based cleanser like Go-To's Fancy Face."

As an esthetician, I believe skincare is more important than covering up your beautiful skin! This seemed like a perfect go to no makeup/makeup product, but it truly is deceiving. The color selection is awful in my opinion. They’re so orange, even the light shades are too dark. I got the shade “light” and it looked so unnatural. After trying this product for 3 days I began to break out all over and I never break out! If you dig into the ingredient list you’ll be shocked. Let’s just say they’re not good ingredients for your skin. Also, this just did not blend to a nice finish... it just kind of separated through the day and made any imperfections look worse. There’s definitely betters products on the market! Personally I love the Illia foundation serum, it’s beautiful and actually has good ingredients for your skin. If you have sensitive skin, please don’t even bother with this product."

I get so many compliments when I wear it. The application is very quick and it blends very well. For me personally I noticed I get the best results when using a sponge to apply it. I can use it throughout all seasons because of how moisturizing it is. Although it is pricey it is worth every penny. The product lasts for a long time and a little bit goes a long way.

I was nervous about the shade choice as lots of reviews mentioned it being far darker than expected. I bought fair as im usually always porcelain or light. Im actually really happy with the match, its basically bang on, so thats a positive. My initial negative is how drying it actually feels. Ive only had it on for a couple hours now and my face feels tight. Even with my moisturizer on underneath. Its also the most full coverage tinted moisturizer ive ever used. The other negative, as many other reviews mentioned, this really highlights any dry spots on your skin. I have combination skin, with drier patches above my eyebrows and bridge of my nose and this is doing those spots no favors. Lastly, one thing i do like is how a little goes a LONG way. I put a full pump out and used maybe half. So i do feel the tube will last awhile. Not sure if i would repurchase as i like a bit lighter of a CC cream, but i will use this one up for now."

I spent the first week using this thinking that it was just my fault, that I couldn't figure out how to diffuse it because I’m the one who’s not good with makeup, it’s MY skin that looks bad not the product, etc. But this formula is just NOT my preference. It's way too full coverage for everyday/casual, it's not dewy enough, it’s way too dark and yellow to be the lightest shade, and it dries my skin out. I'm interested in taking a sample home of their other CC+ formulations once I’m finally rid of this thing, but the fact that they don't make a shade light enough for ivory skin with pinky undertones means I have to diffuse the product with another mineral sunscreen that would give me whitecast on it's own, otherwise I end up looking like an oompa loompa with a muddy yellow demarcation where I try to blend it into my neck. I don't like to waste product though, so I've been trying to use it up for months now, mixing it with sunscreens and oils to give it a dewy finish. I cannot WAIT until I'm finished with it.

It neutralized all my redness and most of my acne/acne scars HOWEVER,  1) I have hormonal acne and it was flaring up my chin acne. It was a double edged sword, it did such a great job of covering it I never would've guessed the serum was inflaming it (derm made this observation while putting me on Spironolactone, and acne didnt leave until changing my makeup, so she was right)  2) made my fine lines on my forehead more noticeable and rubbed off on collars of jackets   I still think the CC cream is magic, just not for me and my skin right now"

But after buying it and using it a couple of times these are my main takes:   - Very thick and heavy yet somehow doesn’t cover anything.. - Goes into all pores/lines and makes you see wrinkles you thought you didn’t have.  - Makes face look oily, at first it’s a nice glow but after a while I just looked dirty.   Good things are that it smells amazing and is very hydrating. Sad that this didn’t work on me bc it looks amazing on other people hence why I would still recommend it."

The only thing to note is that this should not be used as your regular sunscreen. In order to get the SPF advertised one would need to apply at least 4 layers (not worthy).

After using the shade finder on the Sephora app to find my shade (my first time buying foundation/cc cream online), I was prepared to have to return this product because it was the wrong shade or not a good fit for me. All the other cc creams I have tried have been too thick/washed me out! I initially tried out a generous pump of this product and realized: a little bit goes a loooong way. After blending it out with a foundation brush, I was shocked at the color match, soft blurred appearance it gave my skin, and that it was generally lightweight! As someone who doesn’t wear foundation/likes lightweight options, I am so pleased with how wearable this product is. I even did a moderate intensity workout without any creasing or melting! Although up close I did notice a bit of my skins texture more than usual, in pictures and from a normal distance away, my skin looks flawless! So worth it for all of the added benefits!! My skin felt very hydrated despite the full coverage finish. To add a bit of dewy-ness to my complexion, I sprayed some Mac Fix+ on top to set."

It feels (to me) thick for a CC cream, heavier than most of my foundations, didn't spread very well and only medium coverage. The color light was almost too dark for my summer shade. Was hoping for a bare hands apply and go powder free look for summer and did not deliver.  HOWEVER, applied with a lighter hand and a blender spritzed with setting spray it goes on nicely for a sheer/medium coverage for a non drying and not too matte look. (though I wouldnt trust what spf level it ends on)   Over all, I still use it in rotation for a soft no makeup summer look. But would probably consider trying another product before buying again."

I was looking for a slightly dewy full coverage foundation and if that is what you are looking for - this is perfect! If your looking for an actual cc cream/tint, you are probably NOT gonna like this. There is nothing “your skin but better” about this even if the tube wants to tell you that. But that’s totally fine by me bc that wasn’t what I was looking for (surprisingly - if you are looking for a beautiful light coverage true “your skin but better” tint - try Pixi skintint.. it outdoes every high end tint I’ve ever tried, it seriously looks like skin, it’s gorgeous!) My only issue with this foundation..oh god, the shade range is a nightmare. The fair is pasty white on me, fair light is the closest but way too peachy..and light looks dark taupe on my skin. So if I want to use this on a regular basis - I need to mix fair and fair light and it’s still a tiny bit off. If this was really just a tint the 4 shades wouldn’t be a big issue cause it would be sheer and workable, however if you are going to make a full coverage product - the shades matter and 4 just doesn’t cut it...but I definitely see myself reaching for this for the winter!"

I think that adding powder probably makes the heaviness worse but at same time feels like needs to be set   Even though I’ve got this jumbo tube and only about a single pump is required for the entire face I’m not planning to return it but rather use it in small doses and use my regular foundation in other areas of the face.  And all the side effects been occurring from use is that my skin is looking very dry and patchy after I remove my make up which is extremely unusual because I have oily skin.  I read the list of ingredients that I couldn’t see anything that would cause this and I’m wondering if it’s related to the sunscreen? Usually sunscreen  makes me break out so I’m also waiting to see if I get an increase in acne from using this product"

The finish is very soft and dewey, but it does come in matte finish for those who want it.  The first real issue I took with it was how hard it was to wash out of my makeup brush. I had to wash it three times to get it all out. I started to skip using it in favor of my fingertips so I wouldn't ruin my favorite foundation brush.   I also found the product to be a little drying. I generally have combination skin, but it would sometimes make my face feel tight.   Overall, I like the product and use it when I don't feel like doing a full face of makeup."

It's hard to believe that one product can do so much!  I put this on without any moisturizer underneath and I think it does not totally replace a good moisturizer. I do love that I don't need to put on an additional SPF 50+ product.  However, my only real problem with this is the shade range and initial cakey/drying feeling.   I wear estee lauder double wear in ecru and the sephora app told me that the fair light(ivory pink) would be an EXACT match. It was not the right shade at all. The undertones were not neutral like my foundation and it ended up being too dark, but I made it work with some setting powder. There needs to be more color options."

			"review_text": "I bought the travel size of this, just to be sure i liked it. And i definitely will purchase the full size to use for certain circumstances, but it's not bulletproof for every occasion.  The shade range is lacking, and i have no idea how they have not expanded the shade range with this product being out for so long... I purchased Light and i can just barely get away with it during summer. For reference i'm always in the light, yellow undertone category (mixed asian, tans easily, pale-ish in winter), my holy grails are Estee Lauder double wear in 1w2 Sand (winter shade), and loreal infallible fresh wear in 420 (winter) and 425 (summer). I have oily and acne prone skin with scarring. This covers everything beautifully with just a small amount applied with a sponge (dont use a lot). One layer and i'm satisfied for everyday wear, HOWEVER it does get oily and wear off throughout the day, even with a good setting powder, and it's definitely not mask-proof, as it will transfer. But the finish looks natural, and it looks great for the first few hours i put it on.  I like this product for super quick makeup days where i want SPF and good coverage, its good for running errands or casual days. But don't expect this to be bulletproof on oily skin. In terms of shade...Light IS orange leaning, so if you dont have warm undertones, def go down to a lighter shade. In winter i will have to mix or buy a different color. Overall, this is a good product for someone looking for a quick and easy foundation for casual makeup days.  Also for anyone between this and the MATTE formula, the original looks way better and applies nicer, but the other one does last longer (but it's extremely matte) AND the light shade is not orange..so something to consider."

The first time I bought it I bought it in Light medium and that was a bit to dark, even when suntanned. I purchased the light and its okay but I think the next time I am going to purchase a shade down.  The shade range is difficult in this product but not a huge deal for me as I can use less product/wear bronzer (if using a lighter shade). All in all a great product. Great to travel with because it is in a tube and an easy peasy put together look for traveling when you don't want to spend too much time on your makeup.

When I first opened my package, I thought they’d sent a different color by accident. I’m fair-skinned with pink undertones, and typically go for whatever the lightest shade available is. I picked the Ivory Pink tone instead of the lightest this time. However, this tint is much better suited for someone with olive undertones.  I tested the cream on half of my face then let it sit for 20 minutes before comparing how it looked in different kinds of lighting. It's orange-y on me and looks as if I'd caked it on, though I was considerate to use very little product. I was eager to try this out because the reviews were mostly positive and really hoped it would suit me, but this CC+ cream is just too foundation-like and I think the shade advertised was lit incorrectly. If you enjoy a more dramatic look though, this could be a great tinted SPF for you! The packaging is useful, and the pump dispenser makes it easy to keep things tidy."

It's not too heavy, it goes on well over fine lines, it helps remove redness (I have Irish skin), it goes well over acne and most importantly it has a high spf (because I have irish skin and work outdoors!!!!). A little actually goes a long way too! I've used this with a brush and a beauty blender and it works great with both tools!!! I love that there is a makeup that I can run around in and protects me from the sun. It also lasts so you don't have to retouch. I have very pale skin and the ivory works perfect!!!"

The consistency of this formula is thicker than any other liquid foundation that I’ve used. A full pump of this product is way too much. The product goes on super thick, cakes within seconds, and settles into fine lines you didn’t even know you had. I use, maybe, half a pump and blend it out with my beauty blender.

I use my hands to apply CC and bb creams and I tried that with this product and my husband actually said “hey babe don’t be mad, but what’s wrong with your face?.” I have to use a damp beauty blender to make it look okayish - but isn’t the point of lightweight foundation for ease of application and natural look??

			"review_text": "Finally they made a color that suits my tone best. Light-medium was too light and medium was too orange. I swing from fair to tanned with an yellow undertone and suffer from some blotchy redness from zits or exfoliating. This color looks most natural and covers all that nice. BUT be warned, this is very hydrating so better for more dryer or combo skin. I only get dry around the eyes and if I'm exfoliating I need some love. But this is on the greasy side but it does sink in if you use just a little and put some setting powder on top. I don't mind the greasiness because of all the good skin stuff in it and it doesn't irritate my skin or cause breakouts. But mainly its the high spf 50 for daytime that I need along with the coverage. Wearing sunscreen alone gives a white cast or no coverage so this is the best option to look normal with sunscreen as I've had so many lasers I can't leave the house without it. The matte version isn't as greasy and I have that too, but it's only spf 40, so I save that one if it's not as bright out. Using your fingers to apply is not the best I find, same with the sponge. A brush for cream foundations works best. I got the It Cosmetics one new on Posh for half price. If you are already really oily, you may hate this, but just know it's doable if you're willing to be patient and work with it. It's not full coverage but close. I wouldn't get the Illumination version unless you want to look like a very shiny disco ball. I think that one is better suited for mature skin past 50. It's just too much shine in my opinion when this one already will be unless you use setting powder. But don't get turned off by this review because it's so good for your skin, like the less thick spf 30 version by Bareminerals complexion rescue. But that doesn't have as much coverage as this or spf. If you use this everyday it does tend to run out quicker so you may want to consider getting the matte version as well for those less sunny days so both last longer."

Plus, it’s incredibly misleading to sell a product with lemon peel fairly high up on the extensive ingredient list along with other fragrant essential oils that are KNOWN irritants to sensitive skin. Every time I tried using this it would sting a bit upon application and wasn’t very comfortable to wear as it felt cakey and would not only cling to, but also accentuate, any dryness on my face and I’m not talking about severely dry, flakey skin but just any kind of normal surface dehydration most people get. The shade range is also appalling as it assumes everyone from the fairest to the darkest women of color want to look orange. DO NOT choose your shade based off of the product photos you see here as I made the mistake of thinking even if it turned out to be a little darker, that the lightest shade fair would work for my skin—wrong, it looks so much darker and more orange both on my skin and in the actual tube. Horrible product that made my rosacea even worse after wearing it and left me feeling that awful, but very familiar, sense of having gotten a small sunburn on my cheeks."

I’m not sure if I just misunderstood what a CC cream is but this is a foundation consistency for sure. It’s pretty much impossible to blend with a brush but I still use it every once in a while with a sponge so I can blend it out and make it a thinner layer on my face. If applied with a brush it is pretty much automatically full coverage. Also tends to look super cakey at the end of the day if I sweat at all.  I’m probably going to keep giving it a shot every once in a while since I have about 1/3 of the bottle left but it’s not my favorite at all and I won’t repurchase."

I'm constantly trying new makeup and skincare products, and like most people, you find some items you absolutely love and ones you never want to look at again. But even with products that I've enjoyed, I've never taken the time to write a review. Guys... when I say this might be my all-time favorite makeup product, I'm not lying! I was skeptical at first, because I thought the CC cream might be too thick. It's thick that's for sure, but a little went a loooooong way and coverage is lovely. They pack a lot of punch into a pump of this stuff. Anyways, I've applied with both a brush and my hands, and I love both application types. It blends like a dream! It doesn't sit on top of my skin like some foundations or face products do. I feel like my skin almost drinks it in. Some reviews stated that they thought the product left them matte looking or feeling. I have had the opposite effect. My skin looks so hydrated and dewy! And my skin doesn't feel heavy. Idk, what else to say besides: just buy the dang cream. Protect your skin with the SPF and look like a queen wearing it. It's definitely my new summer skincare product!!"

You definitely need to set it with either a powder or a spray, it does crease under my eyes and around my nose on its own.

One time while getting ready i applied on my face, then my boyfriend came to hug me and he was like what is that weird smell? and it was this cc cream. But overall its not bad, i would say its light to medium coverage, feels light on the skin. This would be perfect for someone who doesnt like wearing a lot of make up, that wants something light on the skin. I don't understand all the hype that this cc cream is getting but its probably because its better than other CC cream. I wouldnt buy this again, i would go for a foundation."

But it feels heavy on my face,  I've tried applying with fingers, brushes, blenders, with primer, without primer and it always looks streaky like it's sliding off my face.  Halfway through my second tube it started making my face very red and itchy. I stopped using it for 3 weeks and then bought a fresh bottle as the open one was several months old, but the new one is just as bad. Hopefully I can return it once the stores are reopened."

I tried about 10 different foundations from Sephora (Becca, Too Faced, Urban Decay, Clinique, etc.) but all of them creased or separated within an hour of wear, would wipe off of my nose area, or dry out my face. This is the only foundation that I found to be long-lasting and rarely crease/separate. It has such a natural finish to it and definitely brightens my face. I love that it has SPF 50 in it. I wear it all around Las Vegas in the summer in 40+ weather. It doesn't melt off and I don't burn. It's the perfect medium coverage foundation for summer and winter, as it is super hydrating and brightening as well. I've been using it for two years now and wouldn't switch to another. I also find you don't need a concealer with this product."

I know it was this product because it was the only change I made - and I reattempted to wear this several times with the same result. My skin is sensitive to fragrances and essential oils (most peoples skin is, you might just not know it yet!). As other reviewers have pointed out, this product contains a high concentration of essential oils. Pretty shocking that the founder of ITCosmetics apparently has rosacea and purportedly designs products for rosacea sufferers. One of the main 'rosacea rules' is to avoid essential oils and fragrances! Very dissapointing, ITCosmetics. I wonder if the founder actually has rosacea or if she is just making up a marketing gimmick?"

Has natural spf.   I started using this and after wearing it for a couple hours my face started feeling tight and dry. I couldn't figure out what I was doing because I didn't think it could be from this product. Fast forward to the tube being almost gone and my skin being wrinkled and dry. I took a break from using this and improved my skin a bit and used this again for 2 days and bam my skin felt dry and tight once again! I had thrown out the package so I went online to look at the ingredients and saw there was a number of citrus oils high up on the ingredients which are very exfoliating to the skin! Essential oils should only be used in skin care in low percentages or it can irritate the skin.  I've been working to repair my skin and I do think my moisture barrier possibly could have been comprised when I started using this but it made it way worse continuing to use it.  Shade range is bad. Everything was way too orange and dark for me even with a tan. Had to get a lighter shade but it was the end of summer so I knew my skin would lighten.  Need more neutral and light olive colors. Overall good for most people. Just be careful if you have dry or sensitive skin. If they took out all the citrus oils it'd be great."

Tried several different shades and finally wound up with “Fair” which looks good while applying in the morning then an hour later I see myself in the mirror and it’s all oxidized and orangey looking.

I have oily/combo skin so i thought that after a few hours my natural oils would help but it just *refused* to melt into my skin, it would just sit there on top of my face and it was just heavy which is a rare thing for me to feel!

My only gripe with it, aside from the lasting power (which I can’t fault it for since it’s not marketed as long wear) is the colour range. Even the lightest colour is too dark and orangey for me, so I have to add a drop of light foundation into it. I’m pale but not completely alabaster, and surely this would be an issue for a number of people. Hopefully they’ll expand the range on the extreme ends for those with very light and very dark skin."

I prefer using this in the summer as it melts into my skin and just looks very natural. I wouldn't recommend for someone who has a lot of dryness as this might cling to dry patches. Also not hugely impressed with the shade range."

I do recommend a setting spray as well as I found it makes a difference with he lasting power and ensuring it would not transfer. I preferred a beauty blender for application as it sheered it out slightly and made it more even as it is a bit of a thicker formula. Overall, I really like the look this CC cream gives me and the way it makes my skin feel. I just REALLY wish there was a lighter shade as the lightest one only works for me in the summer now ):"

However, I've used about half the bottle over several months in both summer and winter weather and will probably give up and switch to a new product.

A quick google search I wish I had done sooner shows how classically irritating many of these ingredients can be, not to mention how some of the oils naturally react to sunlight and can actually cause burning!

The only downside is that it wears off quickly if no primer applied"

I usually wear a spf 30 sunscreen under all of my foundations whether they have spf or not, the it cc cream included. Today I was in a rush and just put this on and I put on a pretty thick layer too! In one hour of being outside in not so sunny weather my face was noticeably darker, my sun spots darken up fast unless I wear sunscreen. As I have worn just spf 30 sunscreen on my face in Hawaii without getting darker, of course I reapplied but after like 4 hours, I am pretty confident that this cc cream does not contain the level of spf it advertises. I will continue to use it because it’s convenient and I like the coverage but I will not trust it to protect my skin from sun damage, definitely not spf 50."

At first I loved it - a CC cream with really great coverage but soon after I began to HATE it.   #1. It transfers so easily. If you touch your face it transfers to your fingers instantly. I gave a relative a hug the other day and saw it on his sweater - super embarrassing. #2. I am blonde with fair skin and a neutral undertone. In Estee Lauder's double wear I am 1N1 but even the lightest shade of this product is too dark and makes my face look muddy. #3. It does not last throughout the day. I have combination skin and work 8 hour days. I do not like to have to touch up but it is required with this product. The cream would move around in my oily areas and cake around my dry areas. Wouldn't even last me 6 hours - even with a primer underneath.  This product has great coverage for a CC cream, but too many drawbacks for me to buy again. Would not repurchase."

I had previously used the Laura Mercier Oil-Free Tinted Moisturizer, so this was a step up for me in terms of coverage. I have faced two issues with this cream, however 0- first, I can't seem to find the right shade for my skin tone. The Light is the closest I could get, but it's too yellow for me. Second, this cream is too dry/drying for me. I use a primer (Tatcha The Silk Canvas) and I moisturize often and heavily, but this CC cream makes me look dryer than I do without any makeup or with any other face makeup. Not a fan. Perhaps this works for people with oilier skin or people with different skin tones than mine."

It is a product that is seen to be there, and another important point is the color, I check it online with the shade finder and it is a little clearer than the shade I normally use in other foundation (compare it with Mac) So  I suggest you buy it in a physical store to give the correct shade or choose a darker shade, it is not a big problem but it is not the shade exactly."

Unfortunately, my perpetual state of rush to put on makeup and get dressed leaves little time for small observations.  Also, I do not use IT CC cream every day so I didn’t notice an obvious pattern here that it was the paint on the outside of the CC cream tube that has been rubbing off and getting all over everything.  This is crazy.  The paint flecks are tenacious when applied with makeup so they’re on until total total makeup removal and face wash occurs.  Very sad packaging problem for IT Cosmetics to have since this is a great product.  However, I’m done being embarrassed with friends starring at silver paint all over my face.

I wanted to like this because of the built-in SPF and skincare ingredients, but it just doesn't perform for crap. I have combo skin, and it breaks up on my oily areas, clings to my dry patches, and settles in lines I never knew I had. 4 hours after applying it, I'd look in the mirror, and to my complete terror, I looked like some creature out of a horror movie. If you only need something to perform for like 2 or 3 hours, and your skin is already completely flawless, then it'll probably work great for you.

My skin looks matte in real life, but will look oil-slick in pictures. It sometimes makes me look like I'm wearing a mask.

Kind of unrelated, but I love the way this smells (however, it contains essential oils which can be problematic for people with sensitive skin).

Once when my skin wasnt overly dry, again with just minimal skin prep, when i had no breakouts, and then with ultra moisturization. Spoiler, it was still the worst thing I have ever used. Just use an oil free SPF under your foundation (that has no spf) and you wont have any of those weird pilling, flaking issues."

But it doesn't work for me as a standalone foundation as others suggest, because the coverage is just not there for me (I tried different shades but found it to be a consistent problem). I would have to use a really large amount to get decent coverage. I've tried it as a sunscreen below my makeup as well, and it seems to do an okay job at that. I find it feels kind of lightly tingly on my skin though when I go out in the sun while wearing this. I'm on the fence as to whether I'll be re-buying."

Super soft for my sensitive skin. It takes a little to cover all my redness and it does not smudge in the pores. I suggest you apply it with a sponge (like a beauty blender) because the texture is a little sticky (probably because of the sunscreen formula) so to avoid patches and to assure a smooth finish, it's better with a sponge.  Cons: The cost :'( BUT, it really takes a little quantity to cover the face so it lasts a long time! You pay for the quality! And also, I have a very fair skin, and even the lightest shade is a little to dark/orange for me! But I apply it on the neck too to assure a soft  transition.   Also, it didn't give me pimples so it's a nice thing! :')"

It's not only a color correcting cream it's got anti aging skin care properties in it making it suitable for all ages. It also really hydrated my skin which is not to say that it won't work on oily skin. It improves my skins texture and leaves it feeling and looking flawless with an overall brighter and more radiant skin tone. I highly recommend this because it is so easy to use and to blend onto skin with its pump dispenser. I use either my fingers or a special CC Cream sponge I purchased at Sephora which works wonders at applying and blending the product. I can usually skip my Concealer because it has such great coverage. So don't hesitate and know that it's worth every penny."

Definitely does not provide enough moisture even with serums underneath. Another bad thing is their lack of shades. They are so limited! I have to mix it with my foundation. Also, like someone else said, I think the colours are darker than before. Mine was way more orange than when I tried it last year.  It does smell nice though, and the coverage and SPF is good. But it's not good for acne prone skin."

I use Cover Fx Mattifying Primer With Anti-Acne Treatment under the CC cream and set my makeup with Urban Decay's All Nighter Long-Lasting Makeup Setting Spray. The color I used was Light. I noticed that the CC cream did oxidize slightly leaving me about a shade darker than what it was first applied. The texture is a little thick, a little goes a long way, but it can be a bit difficult to work with if you don't work it into your skin right after applying. Coverage was pretty good. It covered up my light pigmentation from acne scars that I got a month ago. Staying power - after wearing this all day at work (10 hrs), I noticed that most of it had worn off. I will say that the SPF in this worked well for my skin as I can get sunburn while driving. It didn't irritate my skin at all BUT left me SUPER dry. Dry to the point where my skin felt very tight. Because it made me feel so dry at the end of the day, I will be returning this and sticking to the Laura Mercier Tinted Moisturizer."

I love this product because the coverage is amazing, yet it feels so light you forget you have makeup on. The coverage is SO good with this CC cream that I now use it all the time. Everyday at work and for more high-profile events such as parties or work functions. It's truly amazing. It's not cheap but for the small amount you use (I use one pump per morning, and that more than covers my entire face), it's much more economical than what I used to use (Bobbi Brown's BB cream or Skin foundation = $50/bottle!). Plus, you've got the SPF 50 and all of these ingredients that are great for your skin.  I typically do use a facial oil underneath this, but as it has hyaluronic acid and other goodies in it, I guess you could get away with not doing so? I have combo/oily skin, and I've tried both the original (this product) and the matte formula. Even though my skin is on the oilier side, the matte formula feels chalky and leaves a strange cast on my fast as opposed to the brightening and blurring of this formula.  I literally have a gallon-size Ziploc bag at home filled with different expensive foundations, BB creams, and foundation drops (I'm looking at you CoverFX), all aiming to get at what this product does with one little pump. A product that has SPF 50, beautiful coverage, is good for your skin, and feels light on your skin? I should probably just throw everything else away and stock up on this forever!"

I buff it on with a dense brush, over a thin layer of primer, and once it's on, it isn't going ANYWHERE. Super flexible, full coverage and super natural looking. It isn't matte, which is something I actually prefer, as my days of looking like a powder puff are behind me. I blot away the oil halfway through the day and this stuff powers through to the end of my day, sometimes even through spin class and happy hour. Plus, SPF 50!!! I only have 2 complaints. 1. It does transfer quite a bit. Definitely needs to be set with a bit of translucent powder, and a setting spray couldn't hurt. 2. It is so challenging to get off at night. My double cleanse has turned into a triple/quadruple cleanse just to get all this stuff off my ears and neck. Not sure if that's even a legitimate complaint.

I think I've found the key for me is to dot a tiny amount of product on my face with a finger, bounce it in with a damp sponge, and add a couple more tiny dots with my fingers if needed to build up over problem areas. With this method, I've come to like it. It does still tend to be just a tad more shiny than I prefer."

I had to remove stars because it reacted poorly with my skin about halfway through my day. It became extreeemly oily like I’ve never experienced before lol. Downfall.

I recommend the latter. I like this now enough to wear on weekends, vacations and outdoor events because the SPF works so well but not when I work indoors. When I first started using this, I found it was a little drying, so now I wear it on top of my regular day moisturizer (IT Confidence in a Gel Cream)"

Have never burned when outside while wearing this.  Has a nice light lemon grass scent and works well with different concealers and setting powders and sprays.  I use a Beauty blender to apply concealer and powder over this product - product does not lift when sponge is used.  Knocking off a star because the shade I use (light) is a little darker than I expected and it has a tiny bit of a grey cast.  My Mom who has fair skin uses the shade fair/light and finds it to be too yellow.  Although the shade range has been expanded I think it could be further improved to accommodate all skin tones.    Also, maybe it’s just me but this product does not work well with my Bobbi Brown powder bronzer.  The bronzer looks patchy.  I do not get the same effect when I use it with other foundations and on the flip side can use other cream and powder bronzers with my IT cosmetics."

Before using it, I use Makeup Forever concealer on problem areas then after it dries, I use this everywhere.  The coverage is perfect for me.  On the weekends, I only use this, mascara and blush.  One tube lasts me about 5 months and I use it every day!  I have some dark spots/melasma on my cheeks and above my lip and this helps to cover (with concealer) and just makes my skin look smooth and bright."

			"review_text": "I like this CC cream because it is very easy/quick to apply when you are running late. It goes on a little cakey/heavy, so I like to use blot paper to blot down. Unless I have a really severe acne blemish I typically do not need any concealer as this is full coverage. I also sometimes use this as a concealer when wearing more sheer products. One of my main gripes about this is that the shades/undertones do not make any sense and are extremely misleading on the models in the picture. I will say, for example, the Light runs a little Mediumish and that the undertone selection is a severely limited. I would definitely try to get a sample before you buy because what you think might be a close match is likely to be very far off. Just so you can make a more informed decision, I've listed out all of the undertones for the entire line here: Fair Light is cool pink, Fair is warm yellow, Light is warm yellow (but is a shade darker than what most would consider light), Light Medium is cool pink (but is what most would consider a medium), Medium is warm yellow, Neutral Medium is neutral but with a very very slightly orange tinge to it. The next four shades, Medium Tan, Tan, Rich, and Rich Honey are ALL warm yellow, and then Deep is neutral. Hope that helps. I mix two parts Light Medium with one part Fair Light and have been able to get close to a decent match but it's a bit of a struggle given that I only use this because it's convenient and quick. It's quite a shame they don't find it necessary to make cool undertones for medium to deep skin. This really would be a decent product if they got the shades right."

As a redhead, I'm no stranger to sun protection. However, a lot of make-up products that offer sun protection usually don't go higher than SPF 30. Which is not enough, especially for my face. This is the only tinted-moisturizer with SPF 50 (and an array of other multi-purpose claims I used to justify the price tag). But truthfully? The shade range sucks (fair works only when I am at my most freckly in the summer and can pull a bit orange if you aren't careful) and it makes my t-zone super oily. Moreover, the shades seem different depending on the variation of this product you try. The fair shade in the matte formulation is lighter, the fair shade in the illuminating formula appears darker.  Where is the consistency? Certainly not in the tube. It can also get a fair bit crusty if it goes too long without use.   I'm going to try my luck with the new Laura Mercier formulation in the future, but in the meantime I have been using a gel-sunscreen instead with a light layer of liquid foundation on top."

I’ll continue switching between the two products for the days that I need more or less coverage but seriously, this stuff is AWESOME. Also, a little goes a long way... I normally use one pump for my whole face and that even feels like too much, sometimes. I’m sure other people who are better at makeup have some high-tech way to apply, but I just use my fingers and then sometimes blend a bit with a beauty blender. Highly recommend!"

For a cc cream, it is quite full coverage, but for a foundation I would call it medium coverage, which is my preference. It is a satin finish and great for dryer skin as it lets your natural oils come though during the day.   My ONLY downside is that I find after 6+ hours, it starts to break up on certain areas of my face (chin, nose). Admittedly these are areas I touch a lot. This is something I had never really noticed or been bothered by until lately - I am in a wedding this month and said I would do my own makeup. Because of this, for the past couple months I started studying how my face looked throughout the day and how certain products wore (a usual day is a day at the office and often a weights based workout at lunch) and that’s when I noticed it breaking up.  I tried different primers, application tools, and setting powders, and nothing could keep it fully ‘stuck’  I still love it for day to day, and will continue to use it. But I will go for more of a true foundation for special occasions.   I am a fan of the MUFE ultra HD foundation and find the coverage similar with a better wear time for days where you need to look picture perfect for hours."

I will say though, if you are looking for a full coverage foundation that this is not for you. This is for when you want a little coverage but you still want to look like yourself. The “Your Skin but Better” claim is so true. When I did an in depth look after applying I noticed you can still see some freckles but what this does is balance out the coloring in my face. I have a lot of redness in my face so this was the perfect thing to just give an enhanced look to my skin. I’m still playing around with this product but so far it’s great. The one draw back I’ve had is that it doesn’t play nice with my favorite concealer, still not sure if it’s the application or maybe if it’s the concealer but that’s why it’s 4 stars vs 5."

TIP AND TRICKS first of all you have to be aware that a little bit goes a long way, so try not to go so heavily handed.  My best advice would be to use a wet beauty blender for blending it, but If you feel like using you fingertips is a better idea after you finish applying it, dab a little bit the sponge so make sure there are not un even lines  Finally if you want to apply brush and bronzer it’s easier to use if you put cream products, but it you really don’t want to use them make sure your face is completely set before using powder products other wise the product will be moving around and the brush will eventually make some patches"

It was really hard for me to find the shade I liked, and even then I felt like I was in between two. You can’t touch anything with this stuff on, it will 100% transfer. This was extremely annoying.

It does feel slightly heavy but it provides amazing coverage for just one layer of one product. I would set it with a setting spray instead of powder, which can make it look cakey. I found I needed a lighter shade than I thought I would - I wear Fair Light. I don't know that I will wear this all year round though, as the ingredients are far from clean.

I even used it on a night where I wanted to do a full face of makeup and normally would use a heavy, full coverage foundation. This held up way better than any foundation I’ve ever used, stayed flawless ALL NIGHT through dancing and multiple drinks. I have applied it with my fingers, something that would make me cringe typically, and it STILL looked good. Day to day I apply it with a rounded brush from elf then pat it with a damp beauty blender and I love the outcome every time. This is also the one product I have found that completely covers my dark circles. I don’t have to pack on extra concealer or anything!

I did some digging into the ingredients and I just want to know why they included phototoxic citrus oils plus the irritant eucalyptus oil in the formulation. This may not irritant everyone the same way, or as dramatically as it did me since i do have an allergy to citrus - but those two things cause long term damage to your skin even if you do not notice it right away.   I wanted to love it. the 50 SPF and the way it went on had me at first but I just wanted to warn others that may be seriously sensitive to those citrus oils plus the irritant eucalyptus oil. The phototoxic citrus oil basically means that even tho you have 50 SPF on you are going to have a MAD reaction to any sunlight hitting your face. Which is why people think they are getting clogged pores from it.   Oh well!"

Not once, in 8 years, could I find a foundation/tinted moisturizer/cc cream that did not separate, flake, or look cakey and disgusting on my problematic skin. That is, until I tried this. This product applies beautifully to the skin, and wears well all day long. It does not separate, the (full) coverage is fantastic, and it does not contain any ingredients that are likely to aggravate sensitive or acne prone skin. I have gotten so many compliments on my skin since I’ve started using this, and I personally feel it looks better every day that I wear it. Well done, It Cosmetics. This one’s a major win."

I've tried it a few different ways (with primer, without - with setting powder, without, or both.) I find it works best with a primer and no setting powder - the setting powder can mattify it, which I don't want since this one isn't matte. I really like the natural finish of this and how easy it is to blend and move around. It matches my tanned skin really well. It is important for my foundations to have good coverage and color correction, which I believe this does. It hides redness from blemishes and smooths the surface. It feels nice, too, like a moisturizer or sunscreen would. It's not too thick or gloppy. Love that it has such a high SPF, too!"

The application at first is very full coverage - it evens the skin tone and covers blemishes beautifully but after an hour or so of settling in the foundation begins to oxidize and cake, looking extremely thick it creases into the fine lines, flakes on the dry patches and begins to melt on my oily areas.

For starters it was a little heavy and cakey on my skin, and the undertones were too yellow for my skin tone. But since I paid a good amount of money for both the cc cream and the powder I made it work. And depending on which lighting, the makeup could either look okay or straight ratchet. The powder definitely helped smooth it out. It was going great at first, but after the second day of using I noticed, while taking my makeup off, a pimple on my forehead that wasn’t there when the day began. Now my skin was not super clear I am prone to pimples so I did not think anything of it. The next night I noticed another pimple hard and slightly painful. And it seemed every night I would wear the makeup I would have another pimple or sometimes two on my forehead. When I say this cc cream broke me out soooo bad, I do not even know how to describe it. After using this my skin was the worst it has ever been in my whole life. My forehead was covered in pimples and I can’t believe it took me so long to realize it was the cc cream breaking me out. As it was the only thing I had changed or added into my face routine. After realizing I didn’t really care to find out if just using the powder would break me out, I just threw everything I bought from it cosmetics in the trash. It might work for some, but be careful because it definitely didn’t agree with mine."

This CC cream was not hydrating for me, and I have combination to oily skin. Throughout the day, (I don’t even set it with powder because of how drying it is) it just gets drier and drier. I have no idea why and I work in an office environment, but it’s a comfortable temperature so it’s not like my skin is drying up because of cold air. When you first apply it, it looks good because i spray it with a ton of moisturizing setting sprays. I also apply it with my fingers because that seems to give the best look. I’m very conflicted by this CC cream. If you match one of the two trial sizes of the foundation, definitely buy the smaller version and try it out first."

I find that it oxidizes to be darker than it applies so keep that in mind when choosing a shade. I was able to skip half of my morning routine because this is both moisturizing with spf! It goes on really well and stays on amazingly well. I am living in a humid climate with over 30 degrees everyday and it stays... even when I go swimming it stays quite well!! I am also acne prone with sensitive skin and this does not aggravate my skin at all. I don’t have to delay putting on my make up to the last second in fear of not clogging my pores for so long. I am able to put it on and feel beautiful in my skin and know that it will stay that way. Personally found it better than the bare minerals tinted moisturizer which would disappear in a few hours... which felt horrible midway through the day. Will definitely buy again."

I went for “Fair Light” this year because I am not tan. This shade isn’t Fair in the slightest. It’s so orange I was literally shocked when I got it in the mail. It seems darker than the Light shade. I’m going to exchange it for the fair shade and pray that it works. It Cosmetics needs to work on their shade range. The jump in shade range is ridiculous.

This stuff is actually the best BB/CC/Foundation I have ever used. It doesn’t break me out, it lasts all day when I set it with powder and it looks very natural. If I apply it with a damp blender sponge, no one can even tell I’m wearing make up. The color is nice and neutral. I don’t find its too pink or too yellow so it should work for a lot of people. If your skin is really oily, I would go for the matte version, which I found to be too dry and cakey for me. I have combo skin so it does get a little oily around my nose after a while, but I prefer the dewier look this formula provides. With powder/blotting papers/primer, this foundation would work great for anyone from oily combo to dry skin."

The coverage from this is perfect, enough to give you a nice finish without looking like a cake face from a YouTube “makeup tutorial”. I have oily skin, but the weight of this felt fine, didn’t feel heavy or like it was clogging my pores. I was also attracted to the high SPF as well as the claims of the benefits you should see over time. That said, I gave this 3 wears, used my regular moisturizer under it, second time used a primer under it, third a serum. Each wear this product just seemed to bead up and lay “on top” of my skins. It looked nasty, even a beauty blender couldn’t give this and even finish. I see that a poor experience with the texture of this product is mentioned in almost all of the 3 star and below reviews, so it’s clearly something  about how this is formulated or reacts to certain skin. Too bad, sucks to finally find a BB/CC cream that’s the right color and hue for my skins, feels good, not too much coverage then not have the texture of it work."

Redness, signs of aging, dark spots, acne spots, pores ALL VANISH!!!  THIS IS FULL COVERAGE!  I’m very impressed.  I unfortunately ordered color: Light and when I first applied it whoa was it yellow!  The craziest part was it adjusted to my natural undertone and turned out looking completely perfect.  I’m 40 and I have tried so many foundations with no luck.  I look dry, cakey, gross... everything I’ve tried stick to my dry skin and outlined every dry skin cell on my face.  My skin was thoroughly prepped and they all made me look HORRIBLE.  ItCosmetics CC+ Cream SPF 50+ made me feel beautiful again like when I was in my twenties.  It’s awesome.  Caveat:  it feels heavy for a CC Cream and it stayed tacky to the touch so I need to lightly powder my face in which I’m not a fan as it highlights my dry skin.  Even powered my skin still looked flawless.  I used my fingers for application and blending.  I find that a damp beauty blend or quality blending brush takes the product and smears it around and a uneven application.  Try this is what I said sounds like you!  It’s worth every penny!  I’m in love!"

I am in my 30's with occasional acne and some sun discoloration.  I wasn't looking for a foundation to give a flawless complexion; I don't like anything too heavy or make-up-y looking.  This was awesome!  It blended nicely, had great coverage (especially for a BB type cream), and didn't get greasy or creasy even when worn for the whole day.  I work outside a lot and the SPF was perfect.  I really loved everything about this.  Fast forward to April 2019 when I tried to resupply and it just isn't the same.  I am highly suspicious that they have changed their formula.  The product I got was cakey and heavy, didn't blend well, and was not very matte.  I thought maybe I had gotten a bad tube of it; maybe it had sat too long on a shelf somewhere.  Sadly, I tried a new tube from both Sephora and Ulta with the same results.  I would even have been willing to venture that maybe my skin had changed except I had just finished a previous tube of the 'original' and it worked great for me.  I loved the product before but am super disappointed that they seem to have made some changes. I wouldn't say this isn't worth trying at all, but wanted to share my experience."

I honestly don’t even use half a pump on my entire face and I blend down my neck as well.  I do find this product a bit drying so I dab some IT Cosmetics Miracle Water on my face, apply moisturizer, CC Cream, and then spray my face with the Evian face spray for extra hydration.  The dewy version of this CC Cream (purple packaging) just looks glittery to me so I will definitely stick with the original version.  I will repurchase as I have very sensitive skin and it is hard for me to find products that don’t irritate my skin.  This is also a good product with great coverage."

The coverage is a solid medium, but can be sheered out or built up effortless, without ever getting patchy, or cakey. The light lemon scent is pleasant and dissipates quickly, and it never breaks me out. The most impressive part of this product is that regardless of how much you put on, IT LOOKS LIKE YOU AREN'T WEARING FOUNDATION! Even when I get up close with my magnifying mirror after layering it up, I still cant see it on my skin. I would say that this foundation lasts pretty well on me throughout the day, and wears excellently under my other products. I keep trying samples of other foundations just because I love to try things, but nothing has ever come close to this one."

It is comfortable to wear, offers great sun protection, and looks really nice on. It has a citrus blend scent that is subtle and fades as you wear it; fortunately it didn't cause my skin any irritation!

It starts out a bit powdery if you're not well moisturized, but then ends up at the end of the day looking cakey and a bit oxidized. It spreads if you put too much on and are very oily. A really good primer helps, but doesn't solve all the problems.   Also, SPF 50 seems a little excessive (and is part of the powdery problem). Sunlight is good for you, but such a high SPF blocks out ALL the good stuff!  I probably won't buy this one again. It's decent, but there are better foundations at the same price point."

The biggest issue is that the cream does not “set” at all and stays wet on the skin. I swatched the back of my hand and even 4-5 hours later, I could touch my other arm to the back of my hand and the color transferred over and could be smeared around the back of my hand. If you hug someone or blow your nose, this stuff will come off of you. And finally, the coverage isn’t awesome being that it’s a CC cream, so don’t buy it for that purpose.

The product comes out as a buttery cream that feels fantastic on the skin (you really notice the moisturizing effect after a few days in the sun, too). The coverage is great and it stays in place all day, even in splashing water. I did find it can start to look a little bit shiny in the sun, but that's easily fixed with some powder.  I'm almost done my bottle now, and one thing I have noticed is the pump. Most CC creams come as a squeeze bottle, but this one has a pump located at the bottom of the tube, which makes it easier to get out every last drop."

If you want a more full coverage look I suggest using a beauty blender or beauty sponge, especially with a drop or two of a face oil you like. For my everyday look, I prefer to use it with foundation brush from the uncomplicated brush set from sephora. It gives me exactly the look I love of natural but more airbrushed and pore-less looking. It can give you whatever look you're going for, stays smooth and feels clean on the skin. It doesn't rub off on clothing which is a major bonus for me!

I got a gift card from my daughter, and since I was out of foundation, I thought I'd go to Sephora and see what my options were. The girl who helped me suggested this after I told her I wanted something with medium to full coverage, buildable, offered sun protection, didn't dry my face out, and doesn't look cakey. She came back with this and I loved the way it made my face look and feel. It gives such a natural finish that it looks great on it's own. I don't use powder, and my skin is combo with my main concern being aging. I bought a tube of it, but thinking I may get the kit next time."

I love how highly pigmented this is, and therefore how much coverage this offers, without looking like a full face of foundation. The SPF 50  is a huge bonus too. If you're looking for a matte finish, this isn't the product for you, but I prefer a dewy finish and this is great—plus, despite its finish, it has great staying power without needing a setting powder. I removed one star because I think the formula was tweaked since my last tube. I have porcelain skin with yellow undertones and Fair used to be a great match for me, but my new tube is a bit deeper and warmer in color than my previous ones and no longer matches my skin well, which is a major bummer."

I found that other ones either felt oily, caked on to my skin, had visible streaks, melted off partway through the day or caused me to breakout.

I found that using a sponge just took off product when I tried to build up any coverage. Using a brush (that I normally use for foundation) made it look streaky and didn’t have as much coverage as with my fingers.  It smells pretty gross. When you first apply, it smells kind of lemon-y (but not in a good way), and at the end of the day, it has a weird latex kind of smell like an old balloon.  I picked the color based on a foundation shade matcher, but it was a bit too dark coming off of winter. It would probably match during summer though.  I will not be repurchasing this product, but I might try the matte version."

It's smooth, gives great coverage, and blends well. The fair/light matches my skin tone perfectly. It's just dewy enough to give you a nice glow, but not so much so that it makes my combination skin look oily. Some setting powder will take any shin down though. I have used different ways of applying (brushes, sponges, fingers, etc.) and I find a damp beauty blender is the best. My only downside is if you don't use a good setting spray it can crease a smidge in my smile lines and around my nose. But it's not too bad and would never stop me from using this foundation. I would definitely recommend!"

I do apply it so lightly I’m probably not getting the sunscreen benefit to the fullest so I am thinking of getting a new sunscreen to go under it. If you use like me a tube will last forever.

I used it with the Tatcha Silk Canvas Primer to prime and I used the Milk Makeup Setting Powder and the Urban Decay All Nighter Setting Spray to set my face. I used a lot of powder and my foundation did not budge at all. My skin usually dislikes any foundation I put on it and it separates or crusts off (ew) but this stayed in place for the entire day with 0 touch ups. When I used a lot of powder, this foundation appeared more matte than before. The coverage was medium to full depending on the amount of powder used. My skin felt like it could still breathe when I had this on. Lasted through 12  hours of excruciating heat, lots of dancing, sweating, and singing. 5 Stars!! (Pictures taken at 2pm and then at 1am!)"

			"review_text": "I've been using this product for more than a year now. It's definitely one of my go to products. First, I rarely ever give five stars to ANY product because it's not realistic. There's no perfect foundation. Second, this is NOT your product if you have very oily skin. Just don't do it. Combination skin will be fine. Third, LESS is more! I can't stress this enough. It's the best Tinted Moisturizer out there as far as offering extra coverage, however, if you add too much it can look cakey after it sets. Fourth, prep your skin well first, meaning wash it and add a thin moisturizer if you have really dry skin (esp. winter months), if you are normal to combo, cleansing skin is just fine. You know your skin best, prep it accordingly.  How I use mine: I'm combination skin but lean more to the dry side (especially in winter months). I use a moisturizing cleanser first, then I moisturize lightly (gel or thin cream). After it is absorbed, I use half a pump or less of the cc cream. And spread it all over my face with clean hands. I've noticed my warm fingers work best when using this product, especially if trying to achieve a more natural look. I will then finish with my favorite concealer and touch up the undereye area and any blemishes if needed. I will set under eye area with a light powder and I'll dust lightly all over with my butter bronzer (Physicians Formula or It cosmetics pressed powder). Remember less is more, add more only if needed. :) Hope this helps!"

I wear hydrating primer and I moisturize so I'm not sure if I'm doing something wrong or if the product is just not that long lasting.

I was especially excited about the spf part and well, i think because of it, it really comes on a little lighter than the shade you see on the tube. Also, if you, like me aspire to use it as an everyday foundation, skin prep, of any sort, I know because I have attempted from a whole morning skin care routine to primer alone, it will quickly fade, and expression lines are going to show no matter how much your primed and no matter how much setting powder you use. It definately has a beautiful finish to it but there is something about it that doesn´t quite please me, but again that´s my personal expirience. Since I work in an office and I am not always on the move, it settles just fine and stays on well for long but I wouldnt recommend it for people with more active jobs or maybe use it just as a cream and not attempt to build it up to a full face of make up because I feel like although they tried making it sort of a foundation, it is still not one."

It just felt heavy to wear all day; great for stage performances but not for anything else. This made the textured areas of my face stick out (don't get me started on how bad my nose looked) and moved around when I put on powder contour, even after setting it with setting powder. A lot of people love this, but I don't get the hype. There are a lot of tinted moisturizes that have the same amount of coverage with a great shade range for half the price. This just didn't work for me."

I went to get samples and found out its been discontinued so I went on a mission to find a replacement. I wore full coverage foundations for most of my life but these past few years as I get older (65) I cant stand the feel or look of a foundation. A CC cream is just right for me, it evens out my skin tone but doesn't have that heavy mask like look or feel. I googled The best CC Creams and IT came up as #1 so I went to Sephora to get a sample.The sales person took a picture of my skin and said I was a medium neutral. I am olive skinned, I tan easily and can get very dark which I try not to do anymore. My natural tone is beige but its always been so difficult for me to find a foundation that matched my skin tone. In the morning when I wake up Im pale ( for me lol) very beige-y but as I get going, take a shower I get more color in my  skin. I have a red undertone but yellow too.  I have tried every brand under the sun. because there is not a line for darker-than-a -white-girl- but lighter-than an-African-American-girl I usually have to buy two colors and mix them. Bobbi Brown is the closest I have come to matching my skin color but I wanted a different formula. So off I went to Sephora and got 3 samples. First I tried my sample from Nordstroms, Chanel CC cream # 30 and it was too light! I washed it off and tried IT Medium Neutral CC cream. Im wearing it today and so far I love it!! it matched my skin which is amazing and maybe a first. my skin is normal to dry and  I live in the desert so when I say dry I mean DRY lol. I went on my break and checked my face and it  looks the same as when I put it on 7 hours ago. Im going to wear it for a few days and see how I feel also trying the illuminating sample as well. If this product is what I think it is I have finally found the one for me! it looks natural, feels natural !"

I've been using Light for two and half years and will continue to do so as long as the formula stays the same; I will not be shopping for any other foundation; that alone is SO relieving (there are so many foundations out there, it's overwhelming!). So happy to have found my staple. Keep it up, IT Cosmetics, this foundation is a godsend!  I often use with Chanel Multi-Use Illuminating Base primer and the result is truly a flawless finish."

I didn't try it right away, until I had a small breakout, and wanted to cover it up. I used the MAC Strobe Cream first, and then used a foundation brush to apply the It Cosmetics CC Cream, and OMG! Not only did it perfectly cover my breakout, but it also made my skin look absolutely flawless, and dewy. I still have the sample, and the really awesome part is that it only takes a tiny bit with the foundation brush, I just buff it on my skin, and the coverage is perfection. I highly recommend this CC cream. I'm definitely going to buy the full sized bottle as soon as I'm done with the sample, because I have never found anything that could compete.

Unfortunately, what I thought was the best foundation/cc cream, concealer and matte foundation powder ended up being my worst nightmare!!!! The next day I woke up and started my make up routine; my room has a lot of natural sunlight from large windows so it’s a perfect spot to do my makeup. I realized that the color I was matched with was off- I didn’t notice this under the indoor lighting the previous day. The problem is that my undertones are pink, and this product is very very yellow. I had to blend the makeup all the way to my collarbone so I didn’t look  like I had a yellow mask on.  After applying, the makeup had settled into all of my creases and enlarged my pores within minutes- even with a primer. Thought I had applied too much but even with small amount (next day tried half as much) I still had creasing like crazy. Next issue- coverage was amazing, but after an hour my skin was EXTREMELY oily. Like more oily than it is without makeup, even though I applied the matte powder from It cosmetics after the CC. I thought to myself, “well, I’ll  just blot my face every so often to control oil- I am so insecure about my skin and now I feel like I don’t have to hide from the world.”  I live in San Diego so it’s quite warm and humid year round. Went on short walk and the  product started separating on my nose and chin and my face started itching. My skin felt like it was suffocating as well; felt like I had painted my skin with acrylic paint, not foundation.  I finally gave up on all the products except the concealer. There were too many cons just to have an even finish."

My requirements for a good foundation are: reasonably priced, natural, moisturizing, radiant/natural glow, Good coverage, long lasting, and most importantly, made for sensitive skin.  The foundations I’ve tried were tarte, Lancôme, Dior, G.Armani, Charlotte Tilbury, and Makeup4ever, most of which were either too cakey looking, or way too watering and thin, I didn’t go for the fancy foundations at all because they are just too expensive.   I’ve used this CC everyday for at least 2 weeks now, it has spf 50 and I just moisturize with FAB repair cream then put it on, set the foundation with a wet beauty blender sponge and voila! Natural and flawless skin! I work as a waitress for 10 hours a day, the foundation lasts! I’ve been receiving compliments about my skin ever since I used this one.   Attached is a no filter photo of me at the end of my shift, only the mascara melted, nothing else!"

I recommend this product to everyone! It’s really wonderful and at a great price point considering it also has anti aging additives in it. I apply this product with a beauty blender but I know some people who use their hands. My one complaint was that the color choices were not always easy to match because there were not many choices to begin with. I always have purchased the shade “light” and the shade “medium” and mixed them or just wore light on its own. Now I see they have created a “light medium” color along with a few other additional colors so I’ve purchased that and am eager to see how this works with my skin tone. Attached it a picture of me wearing just a light layer of this product as well as one when I wear it for fuller coverage."

The product itself provided medium coverage (not full) -- Unfortunately it did not completely cover some old acne scarring on my cheeks. It does not play nice with texture either. I had some hormonal acne on my chin/mouth area and this emphasized them by caking and flaking in that area. I did not notice a difference in longevity when using this by itself or with Hourglass primer, Mac setting spray, Colorescience sunscreen, etc. Overall it does give a beautiful lasting finish if you have good skin already. I would not recommend if you have active acne, as this will clump and cake in that area and won't cover them completely."

I can't use anything matte and I really need to keep my skin hydrated to avoid dry patches and breakouts. I found CC creams helped, but they oxidized and made me look like I had a bad spray tan at the end of the day. I decided to try this brand (having nothing left ro lose) and I had less dry patches and skin irritation. It's buildable, full coverage, and a little goes a long way! I REALLY love the light dewy feel, making it feel nicely moisturized! It's also not cakey, which is important for someone with my skin type and problems! I always get good compliments on my complexion now, by friends, family, and strangers! No need to filter my photos anymore! In the future, I will be trying more of their products!"

Plus I love that is has SPF 50 so I don’t need the extra step of putting a sunscreen on before. I put it on at 7AM and don’t take it off till anytime between 7-9PM and shockingly it still looks good. For long days at work I make sure to set my whole face with translucent powered so it doesn’t move around but on weekends I like to only set my under eyes and T-zone and leave the rest bare because it gives you such a healthy glow. The only thing I don’t love is that it transfers like crazy even if I set my whole face with powder. If I talk on my cell I always have to wipe it off after.

And also keep in mind everyone that even though this does have spf which is a huge bonus to actually the full benefit of the spf you would need about 5 to 6 pumps so an spf underneath is still needed. I’m a huge advocate of using brushes and sponges but the best way that I’ve found to apply this for the best application is with your fingers.I would definitely recommend!"

Offers outstanding coverage, layers well, AND sheers down nicely with a damp beauty blender or applied after a facial mist. Wears well without a primer, but would definitely recommend a setting powder for areas prone to creasing. Bottle contains a LOT of product. Airless pump is easy to control, and keeps formula fresh. All great, but listen, IT, WHAT IS THIS SHADE RANGE? You basically have 10 shades in the Medium range, and 2 in the Deep range. I am very fair skinned with neutral undertones and the Fair is a weird-looking peachy orange on my skin. Way too dark for anyone who actually has fair skin. Disregard the swatch model photos; they're not remotely accurate. This is such a great product when it comes to performance, but IT, get it together and MAKE A FULLER RANGE OF SHADES. Would I recommend this product? Sure, but only to anyone with medium toned skin."

It claims to be a full coverage but I find it to be more of a medium slightly buildable (which I don’t mind). For a sheer natural coverage I apply with my fingers, for a more built in coverage I use my Beauty Blender or the It Cosmetics brush they recommend for it. Even with combination skin I enjoy the healthy glow the product gives and set with powder on areas where I get the most oily. On days I’m doing a full face I love to use this as a primer under my foundation. Highly recommend to someone who’s new to makeup and wants something easy to use or someone who wants to switch up their current beauty routine."

I wouldn’t recommend using it as a full coverage foundation for pictures either as the flashback makes you look ghostly due to SPF. All in all, this is terrible but it really used to be great."

I paired this with the Bye-Bye under eye in light and Bye-Bye press powder in light and in 5 mins I am done applying!! After a week my skin is softer, more even toned and the dryness has cleared up. My eczema has cleared up and no color change through out the day. Highly recommend for mature skin, this is my new go-to! I figure the tube will last past 4 months so money well spent."

I tried the illuminating version, but the glitter (people claim there's no glitter in there, but I swear) drove me nuts. This one still works well on my dry skin. I also really trust the SPF in it. I've actually used it instead of other sunscreens on vacation before, even when I didn't care about having coverage, just because I knew that I wouldn't get any sun on my face with it on. Also worth noting that I have extremely sensitive skin and this has never broken me out. I wouldn't recommend this for oily folks, as it doesn't set on its own. I set mine with Laura Mercier's setting powder and love the finish I get."

I stopped using for about a year because I was just being cheap is all and also I just love discovering new products that hopefully work better than the first. But let me be very clear, I’ll probably never be without this product again. My skin looks younger fresher and more radiant when I use this it’s better for your skin than other foundations as it is a cc cream.

The fair is light enough and with the yellow undertones that I need, unlike the light shade which has a lot of pink/beige to it.  I am very happy with it now.  I would just caution everyone that the sample pics they provide which look super light are not accurate, or the lighting is intense indoor lighting, which makes it look really different."

I must say if you have dry patches or dry skin I highly recommend using a moisturizer and primer before applying or it will get flaky and cakey in those specific areas. Other than that it blends perfectly with a damp makeup sponge. It does have a light scent which may bother some but goes away once applied."

If you have yellow undertones but are fair, I'm not sure which shade would be best, but light won be it. Despite some photos and videos that make it look like it's very yellow, it's really not.

I really like how i can get some good coverage without looking like i piled on too much product. My freckles still show through but it does a good job at evening out the rest of my skin.  I only powder the t-zone and i do get some shine by mid-morning. When i blot, there is some transfer but not so much where i see blotches on my skin. As the day goes on, i notice my skin looking more glowy but not in a way that I look greasy.  This doesn't feel heavy or sticky on my skin and I like that it lasts fairly long. I've even exercised with it and it did stay on pretty well. I love how this is in a tube with a pump which makes controlling the amount I need very easy. I took one start off because it does transfer a bit when i'm blotting and I wish it was a touch less glowy later in the day (i don't like to touchup with powder to avoid looking cakey)."

This stuff looks great for about 5 minutes but I never completely absorbs into my skin. It sits on top and gets progressively more oily throughout the day. I use the IT finishing powder and that controls most of the shine, but only for an hour or two at a time. I mean, we are not talking about a little oil. We are talking, my face stays so dewy that if I run my finger GENTLY across any part of it, I’ll take all my makeup off with it. The transfer is unreal. If I touch my face and then anything else, I leave behind fingerprints. It gets everywhere.

It's like your skin but better. I can't wait to try the illuminating version next! I apply it with their foundation brush and it comes out beautifully."

I was just considering switching out the BB cream and had heard great things about this so I picked up a sample last time I was in. The first time I put it on I felt like I belonged in a wax museum. It went on incredibly thick and it brought out the worst in my skin texture. I thought maybe it just did not pair well with my beauty blender so I tried again when I got a new brush in the mail. Still, absolutely not. I tried to limit the product, but you need a decent amount as it does not spread easily and will look patchy where it is too thin, and when there is enough it looks like I caked on some cheap oily foundation from the drugstore."

NEGATIVE: after a couple of hours, this cream developed a weird texture on my face and no longer looked smooth. I’ve tried it with multiple primers and moisturizers to see if those were the culprit, but it’s just the CC cream.

I was wearing a heavy sweater and a jacket, so I got a little toasty on the walk. No big right? WRONG.   I knew I had a few beads of sweat on my forehead when I came into the office, but didn't think much of it. I'm not a sweaty lady, probably average. But I say hi to my boss and she looks at me kind of like wtf. So I decide to go to the bathroom and inspect my new CC cream and OMG.  My few beads of sweat had melted once flawless coverage into several small streams of makeup descending down my face. You know how during storms the rainwater turns into little rivers and picks up mud and carries it. It was like that — but on my face. The river overfloweth, ya feel?   Anyway, I freak out and start dabbing it off with a paper towel because I had to go the whole work day like that. I could fix it a little but I looked patchy. So the lesson here, folks, is that you need to be careful wearing this if plan to sweat.  Two stars because it looks bomb if you don't move."

It’s breaking up on my skin within hours and not playing well with my blush. Worse yet, the FAIR shade is awful. I cannot get it to blend. It goes on like chalky paint. I’ve been able to make it work by adding a pump of Drunk Elephant’s D-Bronzi but a. I really shouldn’t have to do that just to make this shade wearable and b. it feels like a waste of my precious DE. One positive I’ll give this is it’s definitely full coverage and a little goes a long way. Also, no break outs. However, it irks me that this has essential oils in it. For a company marketing this as an all-in-one makeup/skincare product, they should know better than to include essential oils. This product is heavily marketed to people with skin issues (like rosacea) and the essential oils can seriously worsen sensitive skin. Perhaps the Medium shade isn’t as bad as the Fair, but I would not recommend this product."

Unfortunately, I gave it a few more tries and ended up loving this product that I’ve recommended to many friends and purchased one for my mom.  I’m not a foundation girl and have always preferred BB/CC cream for its light weight and good coverage. I love applying this CC cream with my beauty blender, it leaves a really nice finish on my face. I find “light” to be the perfect shade for me, but I know it has recently added more shades in between the original shades. I also think this original formula works great for both summer and winter, even though there’s now the oil free version, I might just stick with this one."

I use it around my eyes, touch on my nose and a wee bit on my forehead and a dab on my chicks. I don't even use a full pump. Maybe less than half of a pump and my skin even outs. The yellow tone works wonders for my blue purple bags and red bits. If I use it all over my face turns full yellow.

I have combination skin (normal in summer and dry as a desert in the winter) and on days when I feel like I need a little more moisture in my skin without compromising the coverage, I reach for this. It is so hydrating and covers up any nasty redness or dry patches I have on my skin. I loved it so much that I bought it in 3 other shades to match how tan I get through the year.   However, I took off one star because it does transfer like crazy. If you put on any type of glasses or touch your face in the slightest, it will rub off. But that won’t stop me from using it because I love the coverage and hydration it provides."

			"review_text": "I’ve never been a big fan of full coverage foundations for daily wear, but I do have a bit of presistent mild redness/irritation from having sensitive skin that I like to keep covered. This cc cream perfectly covers my redness and builds up coverage in the places where I need it without looking or feeling heavy/cakey/full coverage.  The very first time I put it on, I hadn’t used a moisturizer in a loooong time (I was trying to figure out what I was/am allergic to) and I noticed the cc cream oxidized mildly on my skin. Not enough that anyone else would ever notice, but just enough that I could tell it was a touch too dark. I love the texture/finish of this cream so much that even with the oxidizing I was willing to just blend it further down my neck from then on and call it a day.  The next time I applied it I moisturized the night before and the morning of, and the oxidizing issue went away completely. Now it’s a perfect color match and it looks flawless even after 8 hours of wear at work where I’m scrubbing and cleaning all day. I set my under eye with powder and the rest of my face with Urban Decay “Chill”. The UD setting spray definitely plays well with this CC cream and the powder kept it from creasing on my lower eyelid. No makeup rubbed off on my phone today, either, so the staying power of these two products combined is impressive!  If you are on the fence about buying this and you have dry skin and don’t like wearing full on foundation on a daily basis- take the plunge. It’s so worth it. Be sure to pick up the IT Cosmetics “Bye Bye Under Eye” Wayerproof concealer, too, because my goodness is it super full coverage and heavy duty- perfect for touching up blemishes that this cc cream won’t cover."

The product is true to the name: Your skin but better! I find that even after running around all night it stays put. I get off work and my foundation holds up incredibly well. Extremely versatile product. It provides a great base for my bronzer and blush too for days I want to add a little color to my face. Even though its a CC cream, it really has the staying power of a full coverage foundation. I've completely replaced my concealers with this product-- something that I never thought I'd say as someone with chronic dark circles! Highly highly recommend."

Pros: - convenient, 3 in 1, I don’t have to apply primer or sunscreen individually anymore long lasting as a CC cream, I find that 8-10 hours is the max for this CC cream, being said you prime and set the skin. If cc cream is used solely, probs last 4-6 hours - coverage is medium, still need to use some concealer for blemishes   Cons: - limited colour selection, I am fairer in winter so I have to mix both fair and light together every time to get my shade - during summer it does get oily pretty quickly so I have to bring powder with me to set it every 3-4 hours  I would highly recommend if you are someone that’s always short on time.

Stays on all day and i work 10 hours and looks just as good as i first put it on! Fixes any dry patches , skin looks healthy, smooth and hydrated! I mix this with my dark foundations as well to create a custom colour and like i said it makes all my foundations even better! Either alone or mixed its an amazing product!

However, the more I have used it, the more I like it.  It sort of creeps up on you.  Part of the issue was the shade.  I initially got the shade Light.  This ended up being too dark for me, even in the summer when I have more color.  I then purchased the shade FAIR in the Illumination CC cream.  This was not a great shade match either and had too much glitter in it for my taste.  I like a nice dewy foundation but I don't like the appearance of specks of glitter on my skin.  I will say that the FAIR shade works pretty good as my winter shade.  I started mixing both the FAIR illumination and LIGHT regular CC cream and this is a better shade match and tones down the glitter in the illumination.  Once I figured that out, I started using this product more and find that it has really good coverage and it feels really good on the skin.  It is comfortable and I don't have an issue with it transferring or slipping.  In cooler seasons, I do not need to set this with a powder if I don't want to and products blend nicely over top of it.  You get better coverage going in with a brush but you can easily sheer this out by adding moisturizer or going in with little product and a damp beauty blender.  I prefer to go in with a beauty blender as I don't always need much coverage but I like that this is buildable and you can get the coverage if needed.  I also really like the packaging.  I know a lot of people don't like a tube as they feel product is wasted.  I prefer a tube with a pump.  They are easier to travel with as you don't have to worry about them breaking and you can always cut the tube when you get low and can no longer pump it out and transfer the product to a jar.  I took one star off because of the shade range.  I have to purchase two of these just to get it to work for me which ends up being pricey."

I am a very green-olive toned NC25-NC30 depth woman, depending on the time of year. If I apply this product in a sheer layer, I can get away with this in the winter. The Light shade is a touch too light and notably too gray-not enough green or warmth for me. But the finish is *beautiful*, lightly dewy, smooth, and even. It covers my PIE and active acne nicely. The trick is to apply over a slippery, freshly (and thoroughly) moisturized base, or it can be tricky to blend. I find after I remove it, my skin feels smoother"

I immediately fell in love with this (and was very lucky that the sample shade [medium] was a perfect match).  I found that when I applied this using my Artis brush, this gave a very natural (your skin, but better) look.  The only thing I do not like about this product is that it has a dewy finish (I prefer a more matte finish, as my skin can be oily), however, a little setting powder and this is perfect!

It is awesome. It could cost more than it does and I’d pay it. A little goes a looooong way. For everyday use you need like less than a pea sized amount. It has a higher SPF than I’ve seen in CC or B.B. creams and the sunblock is a physical sunblock, so it actually helps breakouts. This isn’t oily, comes off easy at night and if you want you can add more for a more make-up feel/coverage. I love this!"

I have an NC15 skin tone so I'm pale, but not the palest person around and the shade Fair is about two shades too dark for me. Other, similar multi-tasking products are typically more sheer to medium coverage so there is more forgiveness for lack of shade choices. Not with this.   Now with that rant over, I'd like to say I do enjoy using this CC cream. It is full coverage which is great for my redness and post acne marks. When wearing this, I do see a lot of texture on the dry areas around my mouth and nose which is disappointing to me, but it doesn't cause creasing in my smile lines which is amazing. One last negative is that it is most certainly not transfer-resistant. However, most, if not all, natural to dewy finish foundations will transfer.   I appreciate the inclusion of zinc oxide for its UVA-filtering abilities. Many makeup products that tout an SPF rating don't have a UVA filter which is a major cause of skin cancer and photo-aging. Please keep that in mind if you rely on your makeup for sun protection."

			"review_text": "I purchased this for an outdoor wedding I attended - not much of a foundation girl because seems like most things make me break out. I'm allergic to good for your skin type mineral foundations too like bare minerals. I have oily skin, especially in the T zone, hyper pigmentation and dark spots (dollar size ones) over my cheeks; therefore SPF is important. This CC cream goes on somewhat heavy, feels a little oily at first, but buffs in nicely with the IT Heavenly #702 brush. The coverage is medium - still needed the Smashbox peach color correcting pencil to achieve full coverage. Used Laura Mercier translucent powder to set the CC cream. I was very happy with the result as the CC cream did not cake up or crease by the end of the night. I would have given it 5 stars; however it does transfer a bit - probably because its a little oily (and imagine that has something to do with the physical spf). Big reason for this review is that I applied this cc again yesterday (same with the smash box cc stick and Laura Mercier setting powder) in the morning, and had a long day - and too tired to wash my face last night (gasp). When I washed my face this morning my skin was visibly smoother, no break outs. Not suggesting you sleep with this but if you do, its not the end of the world and you make find smoother skin in the morning. Side note: I also tried the IT CC w/ spf Matte version which turned yellow and grey hue on my skin. It even turned grey on the beauty advisor who helped me with it - don't recommend the matte version - stick with the original formula."

The packaging lets you use every last drop which i also love! and the color selection, though small, seems to be really versatile and it can be built up very easily.

I've tried a lot of CC creams and this is by far the best for coverage - it's build-able so you can have a subtle amount or add more for more coverage without looking cakey. I have combo skin but mostly dry and I apply this with a sponge so it's not drying but I'll use a settling powder to reduce the shine/dewiness a bit as I find it too much for me. I will say that the shade fair is not quite perfect for me though, I have neutral undertones and this has slightly pink undertones so if you have mostly yellow undertones this shade might be too pink for you - hopefully they release more colours soon."

I usually use this foundation in combination with my NARS radiant foundation to get the benefits from both products! My skin is normal to very dry, and this one makes my skin look very radiant - but not oily! If you have combination skin, I'm sure this foundation would also be great for your skin as it works well with powders.  In my opinion, this foundation all lives up to its hype and claims.

It went on so smoothly, looked really nice on my skin, smelled great, but then the oil started shining through crazy. It’s also not transfer proof at all, I barely touched my face and foundation was everywhere. I use one oil blotting sheet at lunch time in the middle of my day for the small amount of oil on my face, but I needed two sheets when I wore this foundation and the sheets were soaked with oil and the foundation came off almost everywhere I blotted. It works great on skin that isn’t oily because it looked fine the first few hours after applying it. Unfortunately I’ll be returning this."

I have oily skin so to say dewy instead of greasy is frankly, a miracle. A little goes a long way I find, so the tube lasts long enough to justify it's expense. Worth noting that it does need to be set with powder to last aalll day, and in my experience it doesn't oxidize or change colour after application."

It was also really hard to find a foundation that matched my skin exactly, and this one is color-correcting so it kind of molds to your skin tone.

However, wearing foundation every day was too much and was causing my breakouts so i needed to switch to a cc or bb cream and i found this. To be honest, the color match isn’t for everybody. But I have pale to medium complexion, during the summer time I’m tanner in the face and this product definitely oxidizes to match my skin. In the winter the lightest shade is too light and the medium is too dark but I mix it with my paper foundations and it’s just right. What I really like about this product is that it’s the longest wearing out of all the other cc or bb creams. Its definitely no foundation but I can wear this all day with my combination skin and still feel like my skins not cracking too hard if you know what i mean."

Few things you might find annoying though: -It doesn't set well. I found that even when I set my face with Laura Mercier I would still have to be careful because it would transfer. -It likely won't last in the summer for over 8 hours. I worked 7 hour shifts and after work would walk a few blocks to shop or get food and by the time I got home the product was hardly there.

I use Laura Mercier setting powder over it and it doesn't budge. No transfer onto my expensive white show shirts and is husband proof because it doesn't transfer onto him either.

My friend who is an Esthetician recommended the IT cosmetics CC cream and I love it! I have even fallen asleep in it a few times after long days and still didn’t have major breakouts like I used to with other makeup. I have even noticed a difference in my skins texture since using it. It does make my face a little oily at first, but with a setting powder and the Urban Decay all nighter setting spray it looks great throughout the day. I was matched with the Light color in store and it is a little too dark, but I am always in between colors so I may try and get the Fair and mix for the perfect match.

The past couple years I’ve been so much more diligent about my skincare and be what goes on my face and my skin is the best it’s been for years and I think this cc cream is the perfect compliment to my routine! It had SPF 50, which is so great, and has the softest texture when applied with a sponge or even just my hands. One pump is more than enough to cover my entire face, mask my redness (I have a lot) and give me a nice little glow to kickstart my day. This is super hydrating and light so it’s a perfect summer cc to try! I am only giving it 4 stars because it does have an interesting lemon-cake smell and I typically try to avoid products with fragrance, but I have yet to have an adverse reaction."
