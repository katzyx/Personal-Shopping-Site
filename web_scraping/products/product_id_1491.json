			"review_text": "I have stick straight hair that's impossibly smooth (not bragging, it's super annoying) so no hair elastic or scrunchy has ever kept my pony or bun comfortably in place without tightening to the point of a headache. Because these silk scrunchies have a tighter scrunch to them if that makes sense, they stay in place and my hair doesn't slide off like it normally would with other holders. They also fit comfortably around my wrist. I'm now tempted to get another set in different colours!"
