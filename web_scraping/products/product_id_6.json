Also felt that it’s not heavy on the hair, so it doesn't feel oily or look greasy, but compared to others I’ve tried, the performance isn’t out of this world."

Firstly, it smells amazing especially if you like a fruity scent to your hair products. Secondly, it works well. I apply it to my hair in sections and spray it directly in my hands mostly-it comes out with a creamy texture. It’s gives my hair moisture and some definition too. It serves as a great base for my styling product (I’ve layered it with their Baomint gel) and is good to use as a refresher too! Don’t be afraid to try this if you have thicker hair/curls, just remember to work in smaller sections and layer another product on top if you want more definition/hold."

My hair is quite porous and doesn't retain the smell of any products well, so this may not be the case for you.  In general, I found that it did help a little bit with detangling and with hydration.  I wish that it had heat protectant added as well, but the packaging doesn't imply that.  I found that the product is not sufficiently detangling for my hair, nor does it really reduce frizz, but I have incredibly difficult hair.  My hair is fine, curly, and quite damaged from years of fighting my natural texture.  I do heat style regularly and in the photo you see the result after blow drying and lightly smoothing with a flat iron on low heat.  I do like that the product doesn't seem to build up or weigh my hair down, but I just need something more potent."

I tested it on damp 2nd day hair to try to bring some moisture and shine back to a bedhead full of fine-textured spiral curls. I like how you can either spray the cream directly into your hair (that works best for me on newly washed wet hair so I can comb or brush it through to evenly distribute it in my hair) or in your hands like a hair cream and then rub it on your hands to rake & scrunch it in. I found it provides great softness and shine, and left my hair feeling healthy without buildup. I plan on buying this leave-in when I run out of this bottle, as I am very happy with the results and the value for the amount of product you receive fir the price. I have already recommended this to my mom and aunts. And will continue to recommend it to anyone with fine texture hair who is seeking a quality leave-in conditioner.  I received this products for free from Influenster and brand(s) in exchange for my honest review.  #influencer #influenster #influenstervoxbox #complimentary @Influenster @adwoabeauty #adwoahairmilk #WinterWondersVoxBox"

The only reason I took a star away is the spray nozzle! The product rarely comes out of it and it clogs easily. I end up having to unscrew it and tap it out. Not the ideal way to use it. And now that I’m getting towards the bottom I’m really struggling to get the product out. Apart from that, it is the perfect leave in for fine hair!"

It smelled exactly of melon and berries as in the title of the product. It come in a spray bottle with a spray dispenser. Although it is thinner than other leave in conditioners, I found it still hard to spray the product out of the sprayer   I found it easier to just pour into my palms and work through my damp hair. The dispenser is the only thing I would change about the product or make the holes larger for the spray dispenser so it would spray evenly. It has great ingredients including many seed oils and different fruit juices. After working through my hair, I would apply my normal styling products to hair and then dry and style. I found it did make my hair feel very soft and I noticed leads fly aways and a little less frizz to my bleached blonde over processed hair. I enjoyed using the product and would recommend this to anyone. I will definitely purchase it in the future."

I used the squirt bottle and the conditioner came out quite thick and creamy. At first, I applied only a little bit of product as it looked thick and I was afraid my hair would look oily. I dried my hair and it was completely fine, just a bit more formed and easier to control (less flyaways). The next time I washed my hair, I applied more and to my surprise, my hair still did not appear oily. After several uses, my hair feels softer and more manageable. I don’t see as much frizz and my hair stays straighter throughout the day. I feel like it is more hydrated and healthier looking. The scent also was not super strong although it is a bit fruity when your hair is still wet. Once you style it though, you don’t smell much any more. I am happy with this product overall!"

But it does smell amazing and fruity.  Also, there is quite a bit of product for $24 (6.8 oz/ 200ml), especially seeing that you don’t need to use a lot of the product at once. A little definitely goes a long way for sure with this product! I don’t have anything like this in my collection of haircare products, so I am very happy to have been sent this! It is a great new addition for when my hair needs a little extra love!"

My daughter has very similar texture hair as I do, so this works great on her hair too.  I have been using this after a bath or shower and applying mostly from mid hair to ends.  I love the scent, even my daughter has said she loved the smell.  My one and only complaint is that the pump keeps getting clogged, maybe they can improve on that in the future. I love this product so much that the pump isn’t a big deal for me and did not affect my review. I just take the top off and put a little product in my hand to rub in.

I used this product in her hair and it immediately softened the tangle and the smell calmed and pleased her (gave us something to talk about while I tried to untangle the nest in her hair).  The consistency is that of thin lotion, but def thick. The applicator is a pump spray which seems like a clumsy choice since it doesn’t lend to spraying because it isn’t a liquid. So it just sputters the product unevenly into hair (think about flinging lotion onto your hair. It’s not an even application and it’s chunky in applying the product. I wish there was a better solution there. But that’s truly my only complaint."

I’m still able to rub the product in my hands then run the product through my hair, but I do wish it was more of a spray so I know I’m dispersing the leave-in conditioner evenly."

It took quite a few sprays for the initial stream to come out of the spray tip, but I think that’s because it was brand new and also because it’s more of a cream product that has to be sucked up into the straw. Directions say to apply to wet or dry hair. So after a shower this makes it easier to get my brush through my hair without as many tangles. I love that it says it’s suitable for use on smaller children because I have 2 daughters and always try to style their hair. I like that it doesn’t leave any left over residue once it’s dry.  This smooths, moisturizes and detangles. What’s not to like?  The size is pretty great, big enough to last you months, 6.8 oz and for $24.00 that’s a steal I would say compared to other brands. The one thing I would probably like less is if the scent was just toned down a tiny bit!"

I like to finish with a light gel for extra hold but this stuff is also great by itself. I will say mind was difficult at first to spray out since it’s quite thick, but it eventually pumped out. It has a nice, fruity smell and a little goes a long way so be sure to experiment with what works best for your hair and desired style.

What I noticed the most honestly, was that the scent of this hair milk is delicious! It’s a very obvious fruity/ berry scent without any strong hint of the sugary/ candy smell that a lot of products have. Also, there is quite a bit of product for $24 (6.8 oz/ 200ml), especially seeing that you don’t need to use a lot of the product at once. A little goes a long way and if you use too much, it can leave your hair feeling greasy. However, there are a few issues I had with this product. First of all, I’m not sure if my hair is too thick or what the issue is (I’ve always considered my hair to be somewhat fine) but this product can be way too heavy close to the scalp/ roots. It’s good for the ends and bottom half of my hair but I definitely can not use it near the roots. And second of all, the packaging doesn’t work at all for this product. It’s too thick for the nozzle so it won’t spray evenly and clogs after one or two sprits.  You have to either spray it in your hands or take the top off to pour it into your hands and then spread it throughout your hair."

I love the scent of Moroccan Oil products and this didn’t disappoint. It smells amazing and lasts awhile. The formula isn’t too oily or sticky. It’s a nice hydrating formula. It sinks into the skin quickly so it wasn’t very messy. It wasn’t the most long lasting lotion but I still enjoyed it. I would definitely consider picking this up if it’s on sale.  Next the SKIN1004 water fit sun serum. I love the packaging of this product and that it has a pump. I usually applied two pumps to my face. It didn’t have a very noticeable white cast and blended out easily. I found that it layered well under makeup. This product doesn’t have a scent. I think this is a good product to test out if you are interested! - Adwoa Melon Berry Hair milk. This product didn’t do anything for me.. it didn’t moisturize my hair, detangle if or make it soft. It didn’t smell great either. The formula is too thick for the sprayer and would come out in one spot instead of evenly distributed. I tried multiple times to find out how to make this product work and haven’t have any success. The sprayer broke so I will not be using this anymore. I wouldn’t recommend spending your money on this."

Winter does not usually make this situation better with harsh winter winds and heaters blowing dry air. My hair tends to be flyaway, full of static and very dry. This product addressed all of those issues for me (and I’ve used it every day since I received it). The product has a beautiful sweet strawberry smell, is creamy in texture, and provides my hair both moisture and volume. It does not tangle my hair, weigh it down or make it greasy. I’m also still able to keep my hair straight or put in curls, which is something I’ve never experienced with such a hydrating product as my hair is very hard to keep curled. I will state that I’m not as happy with the spray pump design of the product packaging but the formula itself is so good I’m happy to provide a 5 star review."

I ended up having to take off the sprayer to get the product out of the bottle, then working it through my damp hair with my fingers instead. If Adwoa can figure out how to fix the issues with the spray nozzle, this product would become a 5/5."

It seems to work well as a detangler and leave in conditioner, especially for my fine-haired babies. The formulation is light and leaves their hair soft but doesn’t weigh it down or make it feel greasy. My only complaint about the product (which is sort of a big one) is that the spray bottle design is horrible. It rarely works correctly. It is marketed as a spray cream but it is way too thick for the spray nozzle to actually function correctly. This leaves me having to repeated pump the nozzle trying to get any bit of product out. It seems like it would be better if the product was slightly thinner or if is just have a normal lid to squirt some out onto my hand instead. For this reason, I’m not sure I’m would buy again but if they fixed this issue then otherwise the product itself is nice."

The cream does spray out in bigger drops, but I run my hands through my hair as I would any cream to work it in. It does not weigh down my hair (I have finer, thin hair). My hair is soft, shiny and frizz-free after using this. My hair tends to look dry and frizzy so this is a great product that has surprisingly helped with that! I definitely recommend as long as you don’t mind that it doesn’t come out in a mist and you will need to run a comb or fingers through the hair."

It’s a thick leave in conditioner but doesn’t weigh my curls down at all. It’s also curly girl friendly which I love! The only con I have is the nozzle. The conditioner is way too thick and it sprays out in clumps. So I spray it in my hand and distribute the product throughout my hair that way. Overall I love this leave in conditioner!

I love this product to me it reminds me very much of its a ten I'm sorry to use another Brand's name but I haven't had this much love for product like this since that and I think I like it even more with this product it is nice and dense and it allows me to smooth my hair roots in between blowouts allowing me to extend the time in between flat iron treatments. Also this formula has just the right amount of water to incorporate into flat ironed hair without the hair reverting it gives just enough moisture to nourish the hair but not enough for it to come undone especially if you have a keratin treatment or straightening treatment this product allows you to seal those ends and moisturize them at the same time it's like the lock method All in One. The way I use this product is when I first wash my hair I will run this product in before I blow dry it helps my blow dry become more sleek and smooth then as my hair starts to dry out 3 to 4 days after having my hair blowing out I'm beginning to add moisture to my hair with this cream on the ends and The Roots especially if it's been a while since I've had keratin treatment this cream allows me to smooth my edges and smooth them down and put my hair in a nice clean bun. Until wash day I'm able to put this on my hair repeatedly before feeling my hair weighed down. High porosity Naturals out there if you ever find yourself using this product and your hair is way down and you're finding it difficult to kind of get through your hair just put a little light oil on your hair and your hair will move just like normal. You just need to move some of those heavier fatty acids around. I love this cream it is more dense and less watery I like this when my hair needs a bit of hydration but I don't want to spray something that feels like water"

It air dried nicely but did cause me to have a bit more frizz than I’m used to. If I had fine hair, this would be an even greater product because of the lightweight factor. I was pleased but I would not purchase this for my thick hair."

This was a bad idea because it's a cream and didn't move down my hair well, so my roots were weighed down, but my ends were dry.

You can basically do only one pump, and then you have to wait a couple of seconds before you pump it again.

Initially I wasn’t impressed because it’s thick and comes in a spray bottle. Usually this kind of product is heavy on my hair and makes it greasy. I was right about the pump and thickness. It doesn’t spray properly bc it’s too thick to make it through. They should just create a pump for it. I just pulled the spray part out and placed it on my hands and rubbed it on my hair. I have never had such smooth hair like I have with this. No real frizz and moisture for days. It’s like when you first get your hair colored and it just feels good. I actually got compliments on my hair looking good and asked if I just had it cut. I highly recommend this. Even if I didn’t get it as a voxbox I would say this is amazing! Also it smells so good!!"

So I recommend spraying into your hands and applying that way for a more even coverage that goes where you want. It doesn't weigh my hair down or make it greasy. It reminds me a lot of Biolage Hydra Source Leave in Conditioner as far as how well it hydrates but the Melonberry hair milk doesn't weigh down my hair like Biolage did.  Also this product has a strong fruity/strawberry smell. I don't mind it at all. In fact I really like it and the way it makes my hair smell. But not everyone is a fan of strong smelling hair care. It's also good to know if you have other strong smelling hair products, I'm not sure how they would mix.   Overall, I really like this product and I'll be checking out some of their other products!"

It took me a little bit to get around to trying it because I usually don't like leave-in conditioners, if I'm being honest. I have long, wavy hair that is medium/fine and it gets weighed down really easily. It's also a little damaged since going from red to blonde recently and I didn't think a leave in could tame the fuzz. But, I ended up trying this product out on a day when my hair was especially fuzzy and it actually worked really really well!  It is hydrating and smoothing, but it is lightweight and doesn't weight down my hair or make it look oily. I like that I can use it to smooth and de-tangle when I put it on right out of the shower, but I can use it as like a refresher/re-styler on dry hair, too! It's versitile!"

The product felt nice going into my hair, but once it dried, it did not do what I thought it was going to do. My hair felt soft, but my curls went frizzy. I don't know if it just didn't work well with my hair, because my hair is not fine like it states on the box. I had high hopes, but maybe it would work well for fine straight hair, so for them, I'd say to try it, because it may work for them. For wavy or curly haired people who do not have fine hair, I cannot recommend it. It's a no for me."

I have curly hair and this cream has been giving me the best hair days I have had for a long time. I use on both wet and dry hair. It leaves my curls feeling soft and bouncy. It makes my hair less frizzy and keeps my curls hydrated and in place all day. It’s a great leave-in and doesn’t make my hair look or feel greasy or oily at all the way some leave in conditioners do. A little bit goes a really long way. Since I have curly hair, I apply while my hair is still dripping wet before exiting the shower the way you are supposed to. Then I put my hair up in its wrap. Once I remove the wrap then I add a little to my hand so that I can scrunch without frizz. Then I just let air dry. My curls are left soft and bouncy and I love it.  Or at least I did until the stupid pump broke. The packaging is adorable with its pink bottle to match the cream. The spray pump itself though is so cheaply made that it broke in the first week. There was no fixing it. Whoever thought to put a pump sprayer on a leave in cream was not very bright. Cream sprays need an actual handle sprayer to work properly and even then get clogged too often.  The cream is great and I recommend to everyone with curly or dry hair."

It does seem to help some with frizz and it doesn't weigh my hair down so that's a plus.  But the scent... oh my dog the scent. This stuff smells AMAZING. I would literally just use it for the smell. I want to eat it, it smells that delicious. (Note: please don't eat the hair milk).  Can I get this fragrance in a perfume or bath products please?

The product itself, when applied to the hair, initially feels nice but dries tacky and stiff and leaves whitish residue in your hair that ultimately ends up looking like a serious case of dandruff.

I  then added it to the ends of my hair and worked up close to my roots with a test strand. I left it in an entire day to see what it would do banded the test strand to keep it separate from the rest. I  then washed my hair that night and yes there was a big difference.

It actually surprised me how thick the formula was when it came out. It sprays out in to big blobs of cream instead of evenly over my hair. Fortunately it is easy to smooth it into the hair and use it to detangle. When my hair dries it felt soft, smooth, and moisturized. I even had a little bit of that lovely scent left over. According to the directions this can also be used on dry hair, but I would personally recommend against that. When I tried this on dry hair it did not dry properly, and it made my hair texture feel weird and stiff. Overall, I really like this leave in. It smells great and works perfectly on wet hair, plus the pink bottle is super cute on my counter. I’d recommend it."

Here's my honest opinion from using it: I love how versatile it is  in that it can be used on dry, damp or wet hair, either fresh from washing or as a refresher product.  I tested it on damp 2nd day hair to try to bring some moisture and shine back to a bedhead full of fine-textured spiral curls. I like how you can either spray the cream directly into your hair (that works best for me on newly washed wet hair so I can comb or brush it through to evenly distribute it in my hair) or in your hands like a hair cream and then rub it on your hands to rake & scrunch it in. I found it provides great softness and shine,  and left my hair feeling healthy without buildup. I plan on buying this leave-in when I run out of this bottle,  as I am very happy with the results and the value for the amount of product you receive fir the price.  I have already recommended this to my mom and aunts. And will continue to recommend it to anyone with fine texture hair who is seeking a quality leave-in conditioner."

Then I apply it to my towel-dried hair and brush it with my detangler brush. Apply any styling products after.  The scent is berry/melon and pleasant.

I also love how this is a multiuse product for wet, dry or damp hair, and can be anything: leave in conditioner, refresher, detangler, or general styling cream. I’m going on vacation soon, so I really look forward to using it there, so I don’t have to do the whole washing my hair thing after the beach, and I can just the tangle the strands, and smooth out the kinks. I also have very fine hair, and this product does not add weight or stickiness, or make it look on washed. Finally, I love the smell. It’s quite strong at first, but it dissipates quickly leaving lovely watermelon scent behind. Definitely recommend!!"

I usually always purchase it’s a 10. This was such a great surprise! And she’s loving it! I was extremely impressed when I looked at the packaging and open the package,  inside it’s printed with cute little fruit,  The pink bottle is a plus for her! Lol it smells adorable cute fruity, but not like those cheap child detangler‘s. I feel like this was really thought out product. You could either spray in the hair or spray on your hand and apply to the hair. I did notice because of how thick the ‘leave in conditioner’ is sometimes the nozzle gets a little stuck. But I’ve been doing hair for 10 years and that happens. Over all we are extremely happy with it, and if she asks me to buy more I definitely will."

			"review_text": "Thank you @influenster & @adwoabeauty for this complimentary Melonberry Hair Milk in exchange for my honest opinion. 🍉🍓 I have really curly, dyed hair that is always thirsty for extra hydration. This Melonberry Hair Milk is just what my hair needed! I washed my hair last night & used @carolsdaughter Cocoon Hair Mask for 30 min. I then sprayed the @adwoabeauty Melonberry Hair Milk evenly throughout my hair. It really helped detangle my hair & it had quite a lot of knots in it. I followed up with @darkandlovely Blowout Cream and used a diffuser to blow dry my hair. The results came out perfect! My curls are defined, bouncy & moisturized. It didn't strip out any of the red & my hair looks & feels great! The Melonberry Hair Milk has moisturizing ingredients such as Aloe Leaf Juice, Jojoba Seed Oil, Avocado 🥑 Oil, Olive Oil, Strawberry 🍓 Seed Oil, Raspberry Seed Oil & Watermelon 🍉 Seed Oil. Not only does it smell good, but it works! There are NO SULFATES, NO PARABENS, NO MINERAL OILS, NO PETROLEUM, NO SYNTHETIC COLORS, NO SILICONES, NO NUT OILS OR BUTTER. The Hair Milk is VEGAN, CRUELTY-FREE 🐰, SUSTAINABLY SOURCED & COLOR SAFE. I would definitely give this product 5 stars & I'm very thankful for this opportunity to try a new hair product that I will now be permanently adding to my hair routine. 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟  #influenster #influenstervoxbox #voxbox #winterwondersvoxbox #adwoabeauty #adwoahairmilk #adwoahair #adwoa #gifted #complimentary"

The product is thick, a little too thick for the sprayer and it definitely clogs up and makes the sprayer unusable. I just put some in my hands and applied from about midway and down to the ends. It doesn’t feel heavy or weigh my hair down at all. It’s so pretty and bouncy! I have thick hair with a little wave if it air dries and straight if I blow dry it.

So that all basically means single strand knots and impending breakage are a given. When it comes to textured hair products companies often equate “slip” to very heavy products that melt my curls but cause buildup and dull my color. I’ve always had to compromise, even when my hair was virgin. This product surpassed ALL of my expectations and smells DIVINE. Yes, the packaging could use some work, but I don’t even care. Its perfect.   My hair accepted it easily, I had little to no shedding during detangling, and barely made a dent in the product after treating my hair + clip-ins. C’mon VALUE!   TLDR – Tens across the board. Get it.  – someone that works in Haircare product development"

I dispense it into my hand and then spread it over my hair that way rather than trying to spray it directly onto my hair.

Other than that I'm happy with this hair milk."

I usually wash my hair at night, so I’ll towel dry, apply this to damp hair, blow dry my hair about 80-90%, air dry the rest, then go to sleep. However, by the next morning, my hair feels greasy!!! I haven’t changed anything else in my hair routine since getting this product so I know it’s this. Love the scent but not so much the actual product."

However, the scent doesn't stay on my hair which impressed me a lot. The scent is very sweet with strawberry and melon and yogurt notes, very yummy! So I tried the leave-in conditioner to spray it right on my hair, but it still comes out as a creamy gel. So I decided to spray it on a palm of my hand and spread it with my hands on my hair. I didnt apply any conditioner before adwoa, and I was impressed by the results. My hair looks and feels very smooth, soft and less frizzy. I also applied adwoa leave in conditioner as a hair serum on my dry hair the next day. the direction of application is actually suggesting to apply it on wet, damp, dry hair, so this hair product is multi functional.

This has little bits of natural ingredients in it that did throw me off at first, but the notes on the product say it’s completely normal.   I personally do not have fine hair, but I also had my mom try this product and it worked wonders for her and did not weigh her hair down. Being someone that has thick curly hair, I wasn’t sure if this would pack enough of a hydrating punch for me to notice a difference. I absolutely adore Adwoa’s hair oil and it has quickly become a top favorite!  While I do feel like this did an excellent job of adding an additional layer of conditioning to my hair (and smells SO good), I don’t know that it would best my holy grail.

I love seeing the little bits of berry inside the bottle it makes the product more appealing looking. This also has the smell of berries which lingers once this leave in is applied. I went ahead and used this leave in as more of a refresher for now as I already have washed my hair and such. This made my hair look shiny and  I can say it also helped to detangle some appearing knots. My hair before this was quite dull and tangled but this revived it in just a few seconds. I hope to have even more better results when I do use this as a leave in for now I have high hopes."
