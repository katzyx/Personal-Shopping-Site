			"review_text": "I was using Clarins products but after aging into my 50s, I needed something different. I have dry, sensitive skin prone to eczema. The eye cream is beautifully rich without being oily - great for hooded eyes. The moisturizer is also rich and hydrating but lightweight. I love these products and recommend them to anyone who needs hydration without bulkiness, especially during dry, cold winters."
