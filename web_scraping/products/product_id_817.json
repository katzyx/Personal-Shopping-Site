			"review_text": "PRODUCTS: 3 STARS  AIR DRY CREAM is great for those who likes a bit of hold and bit of shine   HAIR OIL is okay. Thereâ€™s just better products like TRACY ELLISâ€™ scalp serum pre-shampoo. Itâ€™s a bit harsh and pulls a lot of strands off of my head. If youâ€™re fine with that then itâ€™s a good product, itâ€™s certainly not for thinning hair.   RECOVERY SERUM:  â€” I thought it worked and I liked it at first and then I tried using it after and I felt like I didnâ€™t miss anything? So thereâ€™s not noticeable improvement when used.   VALUE: 5 STARS â€” You can try the product well enough as thereâ€™s a sufficient amount provided.  PACKAGING: 5 STARS â€”  Itâ€™s well-packaged. Thereâ€™s consideration for ease  of use, including convenience for travelling too.   OVERALL: 4 STARS â€” I recommend for anyone who wants to try the products and as a travel set if you like the products already."

I have awkward in between wavy & straight hair that gets Frizzed or weight down easily if the products doesn't work well but JVN has been such a staple for me this is my 2nd round buying this set. The oil and recovery serum cream are what really stands out for me. The air dry cream is also a lil nice cream but I don't know if it's neccessary, I think I'd rather a sample of the new hair mask rather that but this is a set that came out earlier before its hydration line. It is scented upon application but the scent dissipates throughout the day. It's a nice sort of soothing scent that smells a little herbal, floral and a bit tarty? Will definitely reccomend this if you are looking to try our his products. I am a big fan of the JVN line. I'm excited for what else they will come out with!"

The price is amazing to try the best products and see if you like it. I have fine hair and some thinning issues due to the stress and reoccurring depression. I also have a dry scalp during winter, so I needed to see if this pre-wash oil can do any good for me. It does. It helps to remove the buildup and prevent my scalp from getting dry. I did not have any flaking problems after starting to use it. It doesn't weigh my fine hair down, which is a huge deal. The air-dry cream is my new Holly Grail now, and I've purchased a few backups during the sale. Serum is nice to work on the split ends. I also love that the brand (a sister brand of Biossance) is clean and environmentally conscious."
