			"review_text": "Guys, don’t waste your money on a Dyson! I tried my friend’s Dyson, and believe me, it gives the same results as the Shark FlexStyle. The FlexStyle is versatile, lightweight, and delivers salon-quality styles at home, whether I’m curling, straightening, or adding volume with its different attachments. It is a bit tricky to use at first, but once you get the hang of it, you’ll love it. Just make sure your hair is at least 70% dry and avoid using conditioner, as it can make your curls not last as long. I recommend using a lightweight leave-in conditioner instead. The only other downside is switching the barrel, but I won’t spend $400 more just for a barrel switch and a little less noise. The Shark FlexStyle does everything the Dyson does, and it’s totally worth it for the price and performance!"

			"review_text": "I’ve had this for a year now and honestly I’m starting to hate it. I loved it when I first bought it, it curled my hair beautifully, but now it does the opposite. I recently coloured my hair, got a blonde balayage done and it will not hold a curl anymore, I find that it rejects my hair SO MUCH. It will not fit all of my hair into the barrel, half will be on the barrel half off, and it just does not want to go on the barrel, extremely frustrating. Spent an hour styling it and brushed it out and all of the curls disappeared, did not last AT ALL, it did not do that before I had got it coloured. On top of that as the other reviews mentioned it’s extremely loud. Obnoxiously loud. I hate it. I also find that it takes forever to style with this, I recently switched over to a t3 curling wand and it cuts the time down 3x faster than the shark flex style.  Honestly this is not a need. I don’t even like to use mine anymore."

The curling attachment doesn’t work as great as I thought it would. The attachment part and the base part wiggles so it’s not worth the money."

Best investment I made since I never ever spent so much money on a hair tool before"

			"review_text": "As a hairdresser I’ve been debating buying this for a while now. I figured I have so many tools why do I need this.  I finally caved and decided to purchase it and it’s quite a great product.  If you are looking for a Dyson dupe then this is it.  It’s very user friendly and is not complicated to use even with all the add ons and bits and bobs.  I have fine hair but allot of it with added extensions for length and volume and I got a great blowdry with this tool in under 45 minutes. Unfortunately my hair never held style well so It fell within the hour so I  still will need to use a hot tool on top of this product.  A great product that is easy to use and helps styling air allot easier.  However a few things I wish were different. One is the  handle.  I find it’s just a little thick and has an awkward feel in the hand.  The bristles on the blowdry brush attachments are a little thin. I do think they could be a little bit thicker to get more grip on the hair.  And I wish they included a little bag or some sort of travel pouch to keep everything together and for storage.  Nothing fancy but just to keep everything together."

			"review_text": "purchased a year ago in July 2023, writing this review October 2024. now without styling creams and proper products, no matter how good the blow-drier is, it won't do anything. HOWEVER this paired with good heat protectant, styling creams, conditioners etc. EASIEST at home blow out, that stays for up to 5 days no joke. it's expensive, but it doesn't overheat so reduces damage to your hair and saves soooo much time and effort, half the price of the Dyson one. I didn't regret it at all. if you are willing to style your hair regularly this is your new best friend! -1 stars it's a biiitttt rickety, which for this price point I expect better. also the matte surface gets easily stained by hair dyes😬😬😬."

			"review_text": "I have curly hair (3a). I tried this with a tried and true heat protectant/de-frizzimg serum, and while it dried my hair pretty fast and get it somewhat straightened with a curled ends, I could not get my hair completely smooth, it still had quite a bit of frizz. I tried both the oval, and paddle brush attachment, and while it would look smooth for a few seconds, it would then start to frizz, so I needed to use my chi flat iron to go over it. For $349.99, I don't want to have to use another tool. My hair also had the burned smell, before using my flat iron, probably because of how many times I kept going over it to get it smooth. That also made skeptical about less heat damage claim. It might work better for me in the winter, with no humidity, but again for $349.99, I want something that will be successful all year round. I gave it 3 stars for the quick drying and to acknowledge it just might be my hair texture that it doesn't work well for, but maybe a really great tool for others.  I might try the shark smooth style and see if I have better luck with that."

I use a volume spray, and after I'm done with the curling, I spray a little  hairspray , and don't  touch it for awhile.. The curls, or waves last until the next time. One thing I've learnt,  it's trial and error  and patience."

Trust me, using the curler on dry hair just doesn't cut it. For extra staying power, I pin up each curl after I make it, letting the hair cool in that perfect curl shape for even longer. Then, a spritz of lightweight hairspray while they're still pinned up, and when you're ready to hit the town, just shake out those curls for a fab finish!"
