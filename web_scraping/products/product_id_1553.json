Before this, I was using one from Glow Recipe, and as someone with sensitive skin, switching products can be a bit nerve-wracking. However, I’ve had a great experience with this one. It leaves my skin feeling incredibly soft, and I haven’t noticed any excess oil or irritation. Overall, I’m very pleased with it."

			"review_buyer_description": "Brown eyes, black hair, Medium skin tone, Combination skin",
			"review_text": "nice, hydrating cream that feels good on the skin, but I honestly don’t see the hype beyond it being a basic moisturizer. It’s great for hydration and leaves skin soft, but if you’re expecting transformative results, this isn’t that product.  I appreciate that it’s fragrance-free and versatile – it works as an overnight mask, moisturizer, or primer. But for the price, I expected a little more. There are plenty of moisturizers with stronger active ingredients (like peptides or ceramides) that provide deeper skin benefits for less.  If you just need simple hydration, it’s a solid choice. But if you’re after something that targets aging, firming, or noticeable skin improvement, you might find it underwhelming. It’s good, but I wouldn’t say it’s a must-have."

			"review_text": "In  May 2024 I got the Jet Lag mask as part of the birthday gift reward from Sephora. It sat in my stash of samples for months. It’s the day after Christmas and I cannot believe my experience with this mask from last night. I must leave a review.   I came home from holiday festivities parched. Full of wine, cheese, pasta, and cake I knew I had to get ready for bed. I double cleansed and applied a thin layer of Jet Lag. The instructions say to rinse off but I was asleep before I knew what happened. Today my skin is soft and looks no different before the evening’s festivities. This is not for my weekly mask routine due to the price point but would purchase the mini for the occasional use. Definitely suggest trying JetLag if it is offered as a birthday item again."

			"review_text": "This product is so good. It's so moisturizing without feeling heavy at all. I see noticeable difference in my acne and texture overnight every time I use this. Such an amazing product, I highly recommend. Some people have made reviews explaining that for them it peeled or pilled. If you experience this I'd say just dampen your face. While the product says apply on dry skin, if u find it pills for you dampen your skin and it should solve your problems."
