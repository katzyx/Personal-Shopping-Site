			"review_text": "This is a thick cream that applies well with residual effects so you do not have to reapply after every hand wash.  It is softly scented which is not offensive to the scent sensitive.  The packaging seals securely so it can easily be tossed in my work bag for reapplication through out the day.  However I do find the packaging to be thick and difficult to manipulate, I feel you would waste a lot of product if you do not start dispensing the product by squeezing the tube from the bottom upon opening.  I enjoy using this cream after a manicure because it keeps my cuticles soft and supple and using it before bed has helped with the chapped hands in the cold season.  - Product gifted by L'Occitane Canada."

The texture is rich and creamy, but it doesn’t leave my hands feeling greasy, which is a big plus. I find that it absorbs quickly and provides long-lasting moisture, even after washing my hands multiple times throughout the day. My hands feel soft and hydrated for hours, which is exactly what I need during the colder months when my skin tends to get dry. The scent is subtle, not overpowering, but I do wish it had a nicer or more special scent like their other products. While it is a bit more expensive than other hand creams I’ve tried, I think the quality justifies the price. I do wish the tube was a little larger, but overall, it’s a great product that really delivers on its promises."

I work outside these days delivering mail, and it leaves my hands worse off than when I was a chef working in kitchens if you could believe it. I am basically a hand cream expert at this point, and fly through it all winter season. I've tried them all, and only a few have actually worked well enough that I don't need reapplication every hour. this is one of them. the smell admittedly is not going to be for everyone, it's nostalgic for me and reminds me of a long gone bug spray from my childhood. if you got dry hands like me though, smell is not going to be your concern if your looking for decent results. the packaging is lovely, and comes in an aluminum paint like tube, which is also nostalgic of paints for me. but the results, oh the results are AMAZING. this INSTANTLY brings cracked and alligator like skin back from the dead, and even saved my poor cuticles from receding. it absorbs so fast, but still leaves my hands feeling softer for hours without an oily feel. with some creams I really gotta slather it on but with this all you need is all you need. absolutely 10 out of 10, home run, will absolutely be purchasing in the future. the process tag is worth my poor hands not suffering next winter. thank you influenster"

You have to pull out all the stops or you will shrivel up into a nasty red, scaly, ashy skin crust and fall over and get blown away with the snow. Or This L’Occitane  is a fast absorbing, shea butter laden hand cream that you can use your hands to apply anywhere. Listen: wanna save $$$ on tell tale signs of aging? Botox is NOT where to start. Obviously it’s with sunscreen immediately out of the womb and then every day after, but a second close is caring for your hands. NOTHING shows your age more, and no one clocks your age faster, than by the skin on the back of your hands. No joke. This hand cream is heavy duty enough, but not heavy or too greasy, that it can’t absorb quickly enough for you to continue practicing throwing hatchets or whatever it is you do that requires hands that are not slippery. I use this with the L’Occitane heavy cream, as it makes for an ideal ol' lotion foot in ugly socks” overnight treatment. The shea scent is a bit perfume-y  and not like the sweet, yet earthy scent I’m used to when it comes to shea. This brand’s ALMOND scented line is PHENOMENAL, btw.  Anyway, invest in your hands, in your future. You can’t avoid the change, but you can slow and soften it easily and inexpensively, comparatively speaking. Treat yo self!!"

I still keep this in my nightstand and put it on every night before going to sleep. Along with normal hand cream during the day, my hands stay healthy and not chapped, which is saying something coming from a germaphobe who washes her hands too much."

Because of how concentrated the shea butter is, I can even use it on my knees, elbows, and feet and feel immediate hydration that lasts for a long time. My only complaint is the formula is a bit greasy. Now it may be due to the fact that I religiously use hand creams (after every handwash, and especially on days I work around a ton of papers to prevent papercuts) so my skin my not as thirsty as the intended selling market's skin so I always have leftover residue on my hands. I will work it into the skin for about 5 or so minutes then pat dry with a tissue and good to go! My husband claims there is a perfume-y smell to the product but I don't notice it. My hands are so soft and happy, I love this product."

I unfortunately accidentally ordered two tubes of it and there's no way I'm going to finish it. Quite disappointing."

I tried almost every hand cream out there and nothing has actually worked to repair my hands like this hand balm! I was on the fence about this product for a while because paying this much $ for a hand cream seemed ridiculous to me, but it’s worth every penny! A little goes a long way and I love the buttery silky texture. The tube contains a lot of product, too. I rub this into my hands before crawling into bed and wake up to smooth soft looking hands. It penetrates so deep into the skin that even after washing my hands they look and feel soft! The cons: takes a while to rub in and absorb. Initially there’s a slight greasy look but after a few minutes the cream dissolves into the skin."

I keep one full size on my bedside table and one at work. And I ALWAYS have a travel size in my purse.  I bought this when it first launched at Loccitane and have never stopped. This contains 25% Shea butter and it keeps my hands soooo hydrated and soft you’d think I’ve never worked a day in my life! lol I’ve found that if you use too much it can be very greasy and you’ll have to wait for it to absorb. Other than that, it’s like the original Shea handcream but on steroids. Soft glowing skin, stronger nails, no more brittle cuticles, no more hangnails! The packaging is a little stiff, but Loccitane sells a key that you use to roll the tube with to ensure you get every bit out. I give this away as gifts every Christmas, birthday and “ just because” every chance i get. I’ll never use another handcream. Also, the scent is just like the original so that’s always a plus. Love love love!"

I have tried everything from eating vitamin C, propolis egyptian creams steroids and have lost my nails from fingers. So please understand when I tell you, YOU NEED THIS!   With this cream little goes along way, the smell is like Johnsons baby powder. Its thick but non greasy, absorbs quickly but doesn’t feel it disappeared, leaves a film of smooth and soft hands. Nourishes cuticles and i have actually noticed my skin on knuckles are not dark because they are not dry."
