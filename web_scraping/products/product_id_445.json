	"about": "Fragrance Family:Fresh.Scent Type:Fresh Florals.Key Notes:Honeydew Melon, White Peony, Ambrette.Fragrance Description:Radiant, confident, and beautiful, DEAR SKY evokes southwest skies and crystal prisms. It‚Äôs an ode to the American West and the wild souls that light and blaze their own paths. A modern fruity floral, this fragrance sparkles with honeydew melon, strawberry leaf, white peony, and galbanum..About the Bottle:The iridescent bottle is inspired by the beautiful prismatic light at sunset in the American Southwest..About the Fragrance:Ellis Brooklyn‚Äôs founder, Bee Shapiro, spent time in Texas these past few years and was inspired by the light and energy there to create DEAR SKY. She was also inspired by her bold, fearless, creative, and radiant daughter Sky..Clean",
	"ingredients": "Alcohol Denat, Fragrance, Water, Citric Acid, Tetrahydroxypropyl Ethylenediamine, Alpha-Isomethyl-ionone, Benzyl Alcohol, Benzyl Benzoate, Benzyl Salicylate, Cinnamal, Cinnamyl Alcohol, Citral, Citronellol, Eugenol, Farnesol, Geraniol, Hydroxycitronellal, Isoeugenol, Limonene, Linalool...The list of ingredients is subject to change. Please consult the packaging of the product purchased.",
	"how_to_use": "Suggested Usage:.-Fragrance is intensified by the warmth of your own body. Apply in the creases of your knees and elbows for a longer-lasting, stronger scent.&nbsp;.-After applying, avoid rubbing or dabbing skin. This breaks down the fragrance, causing it to wear off more quickly.&nbsp;.-If you prefer placing fragrance on your wrists, be sure to reapply after frequent handwashing, as this tends to rinse off the scent.&nbsp;.-Replace fragrance after 12 months. Expired perfumes more than a year old lose the integrity of the original scent...Eau de Toilette or Eau de Parfum?: .The difference lies in the volume of perfume oil. While EDT contains five to nine percent, EDP contains more, usually eight to 14 percent. EDPs, therefore, last longer and smell more intense...Recycling Instructions:.-Remove cap and rinse out glass before recycling.",

			"review_text": "The first spray is a very powerful floral with a very mild hint of the rhubarb. Thankfully, the dry down brings forth the strawberry leaf , peony & the cedar. My hubby and I both agree that even though it's not listed , there is a mild vanilla note which is most likely the ambrette note. So happy I ordered this , as It was well worth a wait. I must say it is not incredibly original but it is very pretty and very feminine. I will purchase again."

			"review_text": "Successful blind buy. Lovely creamy, fresh, green fruity floral. Rather soapy & shampoo like, but I adore that vibe. Rhubarb, melon & strawberry leaf make the opening very green & fruity. Pink pepper gives it a little spice, while tuberose comes out after about 2 hours & adds depth. It settles into a soft, floral ambrette drydown.   I purchased it while staying in Nevada & it really does evoke a sense of place. Not a dupe of Mojave Ghost or Cowgirl Grass, but it evokes a similar feeling."

Unfortunately, the scent doesn't last as long as I'd like, fading away after just a few hours. Despite this, I still can't get enough of Dear Sky - the smell is just that beautiful! If longevity isn't a top priority for you, or if you don't mind reapplying throughout the day, then this fragrance is definitely worth trying. For me, the gorgeous scent outweighs the lack of staying power, but I do wish it lasted longer. Maybe a stronger concentration or a matching body product would help?"

I don‚Äôt get the honeydew melon but I get the strawberry leaf and the rubharb but I especially get the bergamot. The dry down is clean and floral with a slightly musky base. I find this scent dna a bit repetitive. Clean citrusy floral musk. I‚Äôve smelled this before and it‚Äôs nothing new. I love the bottle but that‚Äôs all this perfume has going for it. Longevity wasn‚Äôt great either. I‚Äôd say skip this one unless you‚Äôre just looking for a simple everyday fresh scent."

			"review_text": "At first sniff I thought that I would not like this one and it would be too mature. After a little mist onto myself I was happily surprised the fruit scents pulled in stronger than the florals and it‚Äôs actually quite nice. It reminds me of Light Blue but a little more on the fruit side. Once I read that one of the notes was honeydew the scent all made sense. I‚Äôll definitely keep wearing this one but I don‚Äôt think this one is my signature scent. I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôll be someone‚Äôs. The bottle is so pretty for the travel size. If the glass on the full size is the same I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs great too! I do have a friend who broke hers and the glass does feel potentially a little thin. I don‚Äôt know that I‚Äôd actually want to take this in my suitcase as it might break. I do enjoy having travel sizes as a cheaper option to try out a perfume so it‚Äôs not a dealbreaker that I wouldn‚Äôt actually travel with this. For travel I usually bring samples anyways."

This fresh scent makes me feel confidant and beautiful when wearing. The iridescent bottle adds the perfect touch of light to my makeup table. I receive so many compliments when I wear this perfume, from both men and women. It is light enough for daily use, but memorable enough for special occasions.
