As soon as I put it on I loved the cushy slip, the shine, and that it's pigmented. Fwd>> I'm now on my vacay in Sedona Az and feel my lips need some moisture. I've been wearing my fav Sephora mate lipsticks last few days and it's dried out my lips. As soon as I put this on it was instant relief. The flaky dry skin gently rubbed off when I rubbed my lips together. Immediate moisturize and plumping. The high shine and color also last. Tested in the pool and sauna.

The first thing I noticed was the luxurious gel texture, which glided smoothly onto my lips, instantly providing a surge of hydration. The formula is infused with collagen, and over time, I've noticed a visible improvement in the plumpness and overall appearance of my lips.  What sets this lip gel apart is its long-lasting moisturizing effects. Even after hours of wear, my lips remain soft and hydrated, without any need for constant reapplication. This is especially beneficial during the colder months when my lips tend to become dry and chapped.  Furthermore, the Dewyplump Collagen Lip Gel is free from harsh chemicals and artificial fragrances, making it suitable for sensitive skin types. The gentle formula ensures that my lips never feel irritated or sensitized, even with daily use.  In terms of results, I've been thoroughly impressed. Not only do my lips feel softer and more supple, but they also appear visibly plumper and more youthful. Whether I'm going for a natural look or glamming up for a special occasion, this lip gel provides the perfect canvas for any lip look.  Overall, I wholeheartedly recommend the Dewyplump Collagen Lip Gel to anyone in search of a hydrating, plumping, and nourishing lip treatment. It's a game-changer for achieving healthy, luscious lips, and has earned its place as a permanent fixture in my skincare routine."

I couldn‚Äôt tell if there was a minor change to my lip plumpness or hydration because I didn‚Äôt feel like there was any change. I just don‚Äôt see myself recommending this ‚Äúlip gel‚Äù  because there were no positive points for me.

The Lip Gel exhibited an excessive stickiness, rendering it challenging to apply and spread evenly across my lips.

During a morning departure, my husband remarked with distaste upon encountering the stickiness on my lips.  In light of these observations, I would not recommend GXVE Dewyplump Collagen Lip Gel."

At first I thought that I maybe just needed to exfoliate my lips.  That helped a little, but product still started to pill and settle in the fine lines of my lips.  It's almost like this was made for someone with overfilled lips that are perfectly smooth.  The most recent time I applied it, I exfoliated twice, then I used a liquid lip primer and that helped.  I still had the settling and a tiny bit of pilling, but it went away after a while.  Also, it tends to accumulate in the corners of my mouth.  I suggest exfoliating, moisturizing, using a liquid lip primer, doing half a swipe of the lip gel, and applying it at the beginning of your makeup routine.  I noticed it does give a slight plumping look after all the pilling settles out and does feel very hydrating.  I haven't tried it on top of any lipsticks, only lip liner, so I suggest testing ahead of time to see if any lipstick you use plays well with it.  I'm also not a fan of the scent.  It smells almost like they're trying to mask a fake chemically scent with something gourmand.  It's really like for every one thing I like about this product, there's another I don't like.  Overall, I love the color and feel, just remember a little goes a long way, and if you're going to layer, give it a good 5 minutes before you apply more.  3 stars because I like it, but I would not recommend because of how hard it is to work with and others probably won't like the texture."

I haven't noticed much of a plumping effect but this is a nice lip gel to use if you want a shiny finish. The flavor is very good; it's sweet and reminds me of marshmallows. The lip gel is a little bit sticky but not too bad. It doesn't feel unpleasant on my lips. I do notice this product lasts a long time during the day. Of course, like most lip products, it wears off after eating but that's not a major flaw. Overall, I think this lip gel is good to layer over a darker lipstick for a nice glossy effect."

This luscious gloss is the perfect shade of pink that will coat your lips in a gorgeous my lips but better sheen! The applicator is also super easy to use, it just glides across your lips for a flawless application every time. The wand is also the perfect size to glide across seamlessly.   The lip gloss formulation feels super hydrating, you can feel and see a noticeable difference in how juicy your lips look afterward. It's like magic!   However, I do want to note it may be a bit sticky to some people who don't like a thicker gloss. Personally, I do not mind the texture at all.  I'm not saying you need to add this to your cart... but add this to your cart.   This review was collected as part of a promotion"

My expectations weren‚Äôt high because I‚Äôve never tried lip gels before but this left my lips feeling soft and just hydrated which is great because I tend to have dry lips. The gloss is quite pigmented which I wasn‚Äôt expecting and it‚Äôs on the thicker side, definitely don‚Äôt re apply as much because it might end up being sticky on the lips. The packaging is small and easy to bring around on your purse, very travel friendly. The scent is vanilla like which is amazing because sometimes lip products can smell like chemicals, but not this one. I would say that if you‚Äôre going for a natural look then this one isn‚Äôt ideal but it‚Äôs really pretty when using a lip liner and then putting this one top, it‚Äôs my go to look."

Not only does it give my lips a gorgeous hint of color, but the collagen-infused formula also keeps my lips feeling hydrated and plump.

The lightweight gel glides on smoothly, providing a comfortable and long-lasting wear. I appreciate that it doesn't feel sticky or heavy like some other lip products.

About packaging, it's compact, which is travel-friendly. The bottle is made of sturdy glass and offers twist-up component that allows for easy and precise application. However, I think in terms of lipstick, the packaging is not too appealing compared to other lipstick brands. The formula of the GXVE Dewyplump Collagen Lip Gel is incredibly smooth and creamy, gliding effortlessly over the lips. It provides a buildable, high-shine finish that instantly makes the lips appear more plump and hydrated. The collagen-infused formula helps to nourish and improve the overall appearance of the lips over time. However, this makes my lip too shiny, which I'm not a fan of. The shade Boutquet is absolutely beautiful and versatile, which I can use in any occasion.  I would recommend this lip gel to anyone looking for a plump and hydrating look, but also provide skin benefits."

The GXVE DewyPlump Lip Gel has a beautiful, thick, liquid gel, glossy texture that makes this lip gel long lasting. It has a beautiful, light vanilla scent. This Bouquet shade is the perfect lip color to compliment my fair skin. I love how well this lip gel in the shade Bouquet matches my cheek tint in the Bouquet shade. I love how plump and juicy my lips look and feel. My lips feel smoother and more hydrated too. This lip gel starts out sheer with light pigment and you can layer it up for more color and shine. This lip gel has buildable color and shine that is so customizable. I really can‚Äôt get enough of this lip gel. My lips stay shiny all day long. Its high shine finish gives my lips a glassy or mirrored like finish that is just so beautiful and luxurious. This lip gel is formulated with hyaluronic acid which smoothes and plumps your lips immediately while also hydrating your lips. Collagen boosters keep my lips oh so soft, hydrated and extra plump. The doe foot applicator makes it super easy to apply this lip gel onto my lips. As you apply it to your lips, it feels like butter, it glides so smoothly onto your lips and it spreads evenly. I would suggest this to anyone with a rebellious heart looking for a lip gel that will plump, hydrate and smooth their lips while also smelling amazing too."

The design is super cute and creative, and it makes me smile every time I go to use the lip oil.

I liked the separate applicator as opposed to lip products where you put the stick/tube directly onto your lips because I feel like I was able to have more control when putting on the gloss. The product was a nice texture, and not too sticky like lip gloss products tend to be. I also felt that the gloss gave my lips a nice volume boost which is nice because my lips are on the smaller side. Typically I will do a natural/‚Äúno makeup‚Äù makeup look so the tint and shine of the gloss is slightly too strong for me to use for my everyday makeup, but if I wanted to look a little more put together or had a special occasion then I would use this gloss.

You  should also probably exfoliate your lips with a sugar scrub and/or add your favorite chapstick prior, because this will accentuate texture if your lips are chapped or even a bit dry. Besides properly prepping & making sure your lips are hydrated, I did enjoy the light plumping effect it gave me. I also tried it as a topper aka finisher with a few of my favorite lipsticks & it gave me the prettiest shine.

I have the color Bouquet, which looks beautiful in the bottle (and product photos), but it has very little, to no pigment. Unless I‚Äôm under the perfect lighting, it just looks like I‚Äôm wearing a clear color. A positive of this lippie is the applicator: the doe foot is quite large and angled, which I really like! The downside is that, since it‚Äôs so large, the bottle is also fairly large, not a huge problem though, just something to keep in mind. Now, this product is SO thick, and not in a good way. It‚Äôs almost goopey, and doesn‚Äôt feel nice on the lips. It feels heavy, and it‚Äôs STICKY. I used my makeup remover cloth to remove it, and I couldn‚Äôt move the cloth smoothly like I normally can: I had to abrasively scrub it. Afterwards my lips (and surrounding skin) were still sticky, so I had to repeat the process. Not to mention that everything that gets blown into your face gets stuck in this lip gel, and getting the product out of your hair is not a fun, nor easy, task."

First and foremost, the packaging is sleek and the doe-foot applicator is fluffy but big enough to hold a perfect amount of product for each time without needing to get more.   In my honest opinion, a little definitely goes a long way with this product. This is definitely a gel that‚Äôs on the thicker side, Which is my only con. Because of it being a thick gel it does feel a bit heavy on the lips and a bit tacky. I‚Äôm recommending with just the amount the doe-foot picks up, one swipe should be all you need to give you a perfect glossy look and the pigmentation is the biggest plus with this gel. Leaves a beautiful color to your lips and can be built up to add more pigment. If you like thicker glosses, this will be perfect for you to add to your makeup kit."

Admittedly, it felt thick going on the first application and for a minute took me back to the plasticky glosses of grade school that stick like Shine-o-Matic lacquer on lips. Oh no. Nothing like. Gwen Stefani clearly infuses playfulness in her new beauty line but does so with a very contemporary and upgraded arsenal of ingredients, and this lip gel is a case in point. Pillowy, dewy lips last a full eight-hour day, as does the shine, with one good AM application. With care, I found I was able to eat and drink with minimal transfer and zero stickiness. The gel feels comfortable, light and nourishing however the best part truly is the longevity. I never seem to get to a point where the product feels like it has absorbed or worn off and I need to reapply. The plump consistency that I thought would be a downfall is actually a hero feature in terms of promoting stay. And stay also means not migrating or bleeding over lip lines. The only observation for improvement might be in the area of color, as the gel applies at least a full shade lighter than the color of the tube. The product doesn‚Äôt claim to be full coverage but know it provides more a hint of color than a lip color proper. If you are matching the lip gel to a GXVE cheek tint for instance, the two won‚Äôt be an exact match in color intensity. For me, the best way to wear it is over a regular matte lipstick or stain. The gel creates a glassy shine and instantly elevates lip texture and fullness. I definitely recommend trying this collagen lip gel ‚Äì it will more than likely exceed your expectations."

I love the way it makes my lips look and feel, they feel so smooth which rarely happens. The color is more sheer than anything so if you want color you might have to add something else underneath it.

The gloss definitely has some plumping action. It tingle for a good 30-45 seconds and then subsides. The effects aren't extreme, but definitely noticeable especially if you do the half and half test. This lip gel is a lot thicker and stickier than I care for though so I have to be careful to only add the tiniest amount. Basically, if you love a good thick, opaque, plumping lip gloss with a big fluffy doe foot applicator then this is for sure worth trying."

The doe foot applicator is on the larger side but it‚Äôs not too big. The actual lip gel has a very faint scent but it smells yummy! I have been using shade bouquet and it‚Äôs a very pretty natural pink. If you prefer heavily pigmented lip products, this is not that- but there is a nice flush of color. I have never used a lip gel before trying this one but I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs pretty much like a gloss, maybe just a little thicker than most. Even though it is thick, it‚Äôs not sticky at all, which I love. Often when glosses have such a high some they are sticky. My lips feel plump and hydrated whenever I use this gloss- I‚Äôve been keeping in my everyday purse."

			"review_text": "The GXVE Dewyplump Collagen Lip Gel is a gel formula that provides instant hydration, sheer color, and a high shine to your lips! The shade Bouquet, delivers a natural nude/pink tint that is perfect for daily wear. However, the consistency of the lip gel is incredibly thick, leaving a tacky feel to the lips when applied. With that being said, layering the product on your lips will cause the pigment to become streaky, which is something that I am not fond of. It also has an extremely sweet Vanilla fragrance which is a bit too overpowering when worn for an extended amount of time. Overall, Bouquet is a pretty shade and the lip gel is extremely hydrating, delivering a beautiful shine throughout the day. However, the thick texture and streaky formula is not something I prefer."

So when I first swatched it was very pigmented and the color that I received was soooooooooooooo bubble gum pink I couldn‚Äôt wait to do a bright look with this lip gel!! So one I love that it didn‚Äôt have a funny smell to me and two I liked that me being sensitive didn‚Äôt break me out or feel discomfort while wearing it!

This is cruelty free and free of parabens, formaldehydes, formaldehyde-releasing agents, phthalates, mineral oil, and many other ingredients. There are six amazing shades to choose from.  This gloss is SO pigmented, I was not expecting that at all. The shade Bouquet is a beautiful pink with a high shine finish. Bouquet would look good on any skin tone. This gloss is comfortable to wear and lives up to the not sticky claims. My lips have been feeling so hydrating after wearing this. Definitely give this a try!"

It does coat the lips and is a little sticky because it is so thick. However that being said it does have longer lasting power because of the thickness. It applies well and evenly on the lips. The plumping factor is not intense or even present at all which I was worried about at first. I did not feel any burning or tingling sensation like with other lip plumpers. I really did not notice my lips looking more plump but they were definitely glossy. I think over all it is a nice lip oil to wear daily. If you want a more bold lip color I would suggest using a different shade."

My only complaint is that if you put too much on, it gets streaky and you are left with what I call glue mouth. I have no other way to describe the way that some gloss sticks and strings in between your lips when you talk with THICK gloss on.

I loved the idea of this lip gel and it smells phenomenal so, it‚Äôs safe to say I had high hopes. Unfortunately, this doesn‚Äôt work for me. It is very sticky on the lips and goes on super thick. I find it gross to wear. It gets inside my mouth everytime I apply this regardless of how much I wipe off the brush before applying. The color is stunning and it does feel really nice on the lips as far as moisture goes. I have been using this by applying it and then wiping off most of the excess to hydrate my lips. I‚Äôm honestly not sure who the best candidate for this would be. Maybe someone who LOVES ultra glossy lips and doesn‚Äôt mind the tackiness this leaves."

The large doe foot applicator makes application super easy, one dip into the tube is enough for both my top and bottom lip. This gloss goes on thick like a gel but then self smoothes out on the lips to a more traditional gloss look/feel. The self smoothing effect is great as it hides lip lines and gives my lips a more fuller, plump look! This gloss is very moisturizing and comfortable on the lips. It gives a sheer tint of color so you can apply on the go and don't need to be super precise. I love the sweet cake like scent that the gloss has as well! I have been getting more into clean beauty recently so I really like that this product is free from all harmful chemicals/ingredients (parabens, formaldehydes, etc.) while not sacrificing in quality or performance."

The applicator is a doe foot with a well that holds the gloss in it when you pull out the wand from the container.   The product claims to not be sticky, but hydrating and long lasting. Due to the formula containing collagen, it also makes lip lines look less noticeable. Upon applying the lip gloss to my lips, it was sticky - not as sticky as some other brands I've tried, but it had some stickiness, which was not ideal. It is scented, but the scent does go away over time.   Shine was lovely ‚Äì it was more subtle versus a prominent, glass-like shine that I've seen in other lip glosses. Color payoff was disappointing - perhaps it was the fact that the color I used was different from my natural lip color and it seemed to disappear on my lips, versus highlighting or showcasing the color in the container. This gloss did make my lip lines less noticeable and smoother overall. In terms of being long-lasting, it stayed on my lips with eating and drinking for maybe an hour and a half. Over that period, it became a little less sticky, but it was still a bit tacky, which was more obvious when I went to drink water from my water bottle.   Overall, I was a little disappointed in this one. I like the product claims and the founder, but the formula and color payoff was disappointing in my opinion."

The packaging is ok but they could‚Äôve went harder. I love this vanilla gourmand scent (they need to bottle it lol). The formula is thick, less is more with this one. It is buttery for sure, maybe too thick. The more I try to blend it in my lips the more it rebels. I have to keep rubbing my lips together to blend, but it feels and looks like pigs have to fly before that happens.   I was expecting to feel that plumping, tingling effect you might find in other plumping glosses but this one doesn‚Äôt do it. I don‚Äôt see a difference in the plumping effect. I like that it is not sticky but this formula reminds me too much of the old school cheap glosses in the beauty supply store. I would get another solely off of nostalgic purposes. I most likely would have loved this gloss more if I tried a deeper shade because this one is ashy on me or pair with a darker lip liner. I prefer this shade better in the cheek tint. So plump or dump?"

As someone who's always on the lookout for the perfect combination of hydration, color, and plumpness in a lip product, I can confidently say that this lip gel ticks all the boxes and then some. I tried the shade Bouquet; It's a beautiful soft pink peach hue that adds a beautiful tint to the lips. This collagen infused formula is so luxurious. Not only does it provide a subtle plumping effect, but it also works wonders in terms of hydration! this formula is an absolute dream to apply. Unlike some lip glosses that can feel sticky or tacky, this lip gel feels lightweight. It doesn't have that heavy, greasy feeling that some lip products can leave behind, which is a huge plus in my book."

When you apply the gel-like formula you definitely feel it on your mouth. I got Peony so it has a slight pink sheen. Not opaque. A little goes a long way but once it's on its not going anywhere. it's not gloopy but has the potential to be if you apply too much. It feels hydrating and it stays put for hours. When people comment that it's sticky - I can press/rub my lips together and they don't stick together or get those strings. I would describe it more as a tacky, thick gel. I would 100% get more shades. Also the shine is amazing which gives the illusion of plumping. It doesn't tingle and has that vanilla frosting type fragrance just like the other lip gloss formula."

I applied this early in the morning and there was still remnants of it coating my lips at lunch time! And it keeps my lips so hydrated and soft! The stickiness almost provides a protective barrier. I have even started applying it before bed like a lip mask. It has a strong vanilla cupcake fragrance, which I could do without since fragrances can contribute to irritation.

I really enjoy this corally pink or mauvey color and love how it isn't overly powering color. It was a bummer to me for my hair to stick to my lips as soon as I put it in. It did stay on pretty good and seemed like the gel part of it made it pretty grippy which is a plus if you want it to stay on all day. I just wish it wasn't so sticky but if you grew up in the era where every lip gloss was sticky you probably wouldn't mind.

The lip oil has the lightest sweet scent like vanilla , it‚Äôs very subtle.  The texture doesn‚Äôt feel like an oil , it‚Äôs actually very thick ,  if you don‚Äôt enjoy sticky glosses.  I would start clear because this is almost glue thick .  I don‚Äôt mind the texture .  The pigment is ok , even though it‚Äôs a light color it still shows up on my lips ,  brightens them up just a little bit . I haven‚Äôt noticed it marking my lips dry at all . Also I noticed the wand for it is that kind that is staticky and will suck extra lip product back into the container , pump it a few times then hold the lip gloss container upside down above the wand and watch the gloss go up wards back into the tube. I like those ones ,  they are meant to keep too much product from getting onto your lips and wand . Overall this is a nice lip gloss but I‚Äôm not in love with it ."

To give you an idea of how powerful this scent is, after swatching on my hand for the picture and removing it, I can still smell it. ü§¢   3. TEXTURE: This is not what I would call a lip gel.  The texture is so thick and goopy, I know it will gather.  That being said, if you like this type of product and can get past the scent, you might enjoy the shine.   FINAL THOUGHT: This is an immediate return for me and to say I'm disappointed in this product is an understatement. I have rarely hated a lip product as much as I did this one."

			"review_text": "As someone who's constantly searching for lip products that provide both hydration and a touch of glamour, I was eager to try out the GXVE Dewyplump Collagen Lip Gel. After incorporating it into my daily routine for a while, here's my honest review. Let's start with the packaging. The lip gel comes in a sleek, compact tube that's perfect for throwing into your purse or pocket for on-the-go touch-ups. I appreciate the simplicity and elegance of the design, which aligns well with the brand's aesthetic. Upon first application, I noticed the smooth, creamy texture of the lip gel. It glides effortlessly onto the lips, instantly providing a boost of hydration. The formula contains collagen-boosting ingredients, which intrigued me as someone who values skincare benefits in my makeup products. While I can't speak to any long-term effects just yet, I do notice that my lips feel softer and smoother after each use. One of the standout features of this lip gel is its versatility. It can be worn alone for a subtle, natural look or layered over lipstick for added shine and dimension. I particularly enjoy wearing it on its own for a low-maintenance, my lips but better kind of vibe. The subtle hint of gloss adds a touch of glamour without feeling sticky or tacky. Speaking of glossiness, I appreciate that this lip gel provides a beautiful, dewy finish without being overly shiny. It strikes the perfect balance between a subtle sheen and a full-on gloss, giving my lips a healthy, luminous appearance. In terms of wear time, I'm pleasantly surprised by how long-lasting this lip gel is. While it may need to be reapplied after eating or drinking, it holds up admirably throughout the day, maintaining its hydrating properties and glossy finish. Another aspect worth mentioning is the scent and taste of the lip gel. It has a subtle, pleasant fragrance that isn't overpowering or artificial. Additionally, it doesn't have a noticeable taste, which is a bonus for those who prefer their lip prod"

It does exactly what it's advertised to do and I love the look of it on the lip. Shade bouquet definitely has some pigment to it but yet also looks pretty natural at the same time and can be layered over other products. I like that all the the lip gels have matching cheek tints. As long as you're ok with the slightly heavy feel of the product this is a winner! I'm rating this a four out of five stars only because the heaviness of the product is pretty noticeable for me.
