	"how_to_use": "Suggested Usage:.-Apply GrandeLASH™ using a single stroke on your eyelid just above your upper lash line (like a liquid eyeliner)..-Use once daily and allow 1-2 minutes for the serum to dry...Tips:.-Remember, you’re applying to the skin closest to the lashes (the lash root), not the actual lashes..-You don’t need multiple applications or double dips. Using more than instructed will not yield quicker results. One dip into the bottle is enough for both eyes..-Due to the length of the lash cycle, apply every day for a full three months..-After desired improvement is achieved, apply every other day for maintenance. GrandeLASH™ requires continued use to maintain benefits...Precautions:.-Do not get into the eyes; in the event of direct contact, rinse with cool water. .-If you are under a physician’s care for an eye condition, are prone to dry eyes or are pregnant or nursing, consult your physician before use. .-Stop use if redness or irritation occurs. .-Keep out of reach of children.

I used it for about a week, when I woke up one morning to my right eye being so bloodshot and sore. I haven’t changed anything in my nighttime routine except for using this serum. I will never use again. I am waiting to see my optometrist as my doctor believes I have a chemical burn on my eye.  Please use something else…. There are tons of reviews of ppl having this kind of issue. I believed I wouldn’t be one of them. Save yourself the issues"

My lashes are much longer and look amazing with mascara! I often get compliments about how long they are. In the first photo were my lashes before using the serum, and after almost 5 months."

It took a couple weeks to notice a different but it was very evident once it started working. I had a complete bald spot on the inner corner of one of my eyes from ripping them out (accidentall) which sucked and I was super insecure about it. That’s when I decided to give this product a chance. After a couple weeks my lashes fully grew back in where they had been ripped out. I only have two downsides to this product one of which isn’t even really a downside but in this circumstance despite it growing back my missing eyelashes, it grew the adjacent lashes exponentially and made them visibly longer than the ones that were growing back (this really only showed its effectiveness tbh). But the real downside I have with this product it that as someone with sensitive skin my lashline does become a bit red and irritated causing the skin to peel off occasionally. If not for that this would’ve been a five-star product, but also not everyone will experience this issue. With that being said I cannot recommend this product enough seriously I tell everyone to just try it out for a couple weeks because it helped me so so much!"

I ended up buying 2 from their website directly since it was constantly sold out on here...and there was a two-fer sale.  I used the first for a few weeks and it was done, the second a few weeks later. Conceptually i get the concept of 1/10, but when you finish the product in what feels like days after you opened it and you spent 50$ on it.....something just doenst feel right.  I cant blow my money like that..for that cost someone should come to my house to lay my falsies....sorry Grandlash"

I used to wear falsies all the time and now I barely do because I love how my lashes look with mascara. This product is amazing!!!!"
