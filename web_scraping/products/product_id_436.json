			"review_text": "This cleansing balm is, without a doubt, another star product from the brand. The initial texture is a smooth, easy-to-handle balm that transforms into a light oil upon contact with the skin. Massaging this product into your face feels delicate and soothing—truly a delightful experience. The scent is subtle, fresh, and tropical, with hints of bergamot adding a sophisticated touch (I love that ELEMIS incorporates bergamot in many of their products!). Far from feeling greasy, the oil resembles a rich serum in texture. From the first use, you’ll notice how it softens and nourishes your skin. The product is designed to remove makeup and impurities, but it also doubles as a multifunctional balm that nourishes and revitalizes thanks to its formula enriched with botanical oils and marine extracts. For an added boost of hydration, you can even use it as a nourishing mask. After massaging it in to achieve the oily texture, remove it with a soft cloth dampened with warm water. It’s easy to wipe off, leaves no greasy residue, and leaves your skin feeling incredibly soft and ready for the rest of your skincare routine. At $68 for 3.7 oz (105 g), ELEMIS isn’t the most affordable brand, but the quality and results make it absolutely worth the splurge."

The fragrance is heavenly: a soothing blend of fig, raspberry, and bergamot that’s subtle but uplifting. My skin feels soft, hydrated, and refreshed after every use. It’s gentle yet effective, leaving no residue behind. I also love using it as a quick hydrating mask when my skin feels dry.

I actually love to use it as a mask before getting in the shower and letting my pores clear out. It goes on buttery and silky and you can feel its active ingredients sinking in. My skin soaks it up, rehydrates, moisturizes, and then cleans easily to a fresh sleight. I don’t use a whole lot of makeup, but I can tell you that it will remove anything you need it to. I have no problem with its light fragrance and no concerns about leaving on too long or using too often. My skin feels very soft, clean, and healthy. I love how my texture is feeling smooth, clear, and protected, rather than stripped. My pores look smaller and my skin has a nice glow. I like the ingredients, the packaging, and it is a little pricey, but I do think it’s worth it especially if you use other cleansing products, alternating. Great product and I feel the benefits after washing away."

I use this cleansing balm as the first step in my double cleansing routine, prior to my regular facial cleanser. While I’ve found that makeup balms can be a bit messy, the effectiveness of this product far outweighs that minor inconvenience. It thoroughly dissolves all traces of makeup, leaving my skin feeling clean and refreshed. I’ve made it a point to incorporate this into my daily routine, and I can say it has improved my cleansing process.

It has more of a natural, earthy, yet slightly sweet smell. I like that it isn’t super strong or “perfume-y”. I really like this scent! Like the other Elemis Cleansing balms, this comes in a screw top container and starts as a solid creamy balm. Once you touch your fingers to it, it melts into a liquid oil form. The texture is smooth and velvety. It is easy to rub into your skin and easily removes makeup. Adding water helps emulsify the product and turns it into more of a cleanser feel. Once rinsed off it doesn’t feel oily or heavy, and leaves my face feeling clean. For my combination skin it works great, but I could see where oily skin may feel differently about cleaning balms.  The price in my opinion is very reasonable, a little bit goes a long ways, so it will actually last a while. I’d consider this a cleansing balm worth trying out!"

			"review_text": "I recently tried the Elemis Pro-Collagen Green Fig Cleansing Balm, and while I absolutely love how effectively it removes makeup—even stubborn, long-wear formulas—I still prefer the original version because of its scent. The Green Fig scent is pleasant, but the original fragrance feels more luxurious and familiar to me.  That said, this balm works beautifully! It melts into a rich oil that effortlessly dissolves makeup, grime, and daily impurities without stripping my skin’s moisture. After rinsing, my skin feels soft, hydrated, and incredibly smooth. Plus, I appreciate the dual-purpose design—it doubles as a nourishing mask when I want an extra boost of hydration.  If you’re a fan of cleansing balms, this one is definitely worth trying! It delivers on its promises, leaving your skin refreshed and glowing."

The texture is smooth and buttery, and it transforms into a silky oil as soon as it touches the skin.  One of the best things about this product is how gentle it feels. I have sensitive skin, and many cleansers leave my face feeling dry or irritated, but this balm leaves my skin soft and hydrated. There’s no tightness or greasy residue afterward. Plus, it has a subtle, calming scent that makes my nighttime routine feel a little more luxurious.  A little goes a long way, so the jar should last quite a while. The packaging is sleek and sturdy, and it even comes with a small spatula, which keeps things hygienic.  Pros:  • Effortlessly removes stubborn makeup  • Leaves skin soft and moisturized  • Gentle on sensitive skin  • Pleasant scent and luxurious texture  Cons:  • Slightly pricey, but worth it for the quality  • Can feel a bit heavy for those with very oily skin  Overall, this is a fantastic cleansing balm that feels like a treat for the skin. Highly recommend it if you’re looking for an effective, gentle way to remove makeup at the end of the day!"

From the minute I open the jar, I can feel tension melt away.  I love the 3 phases of this product.  A mini facial in just the time it takes to wash your face.  My skin feels soft and clean.  While I move around on the cleanser I use the second time in a day, Elemis has my balm cleanse locked up!  The rose makes it extra special for me.  I wish Sephora would offer the 200ml size."

It's travel friendly, if you're going away for the weekend and don't want to pack a lot of skincare. I've used it as the first step in my skincare routine as well as the second step.  You just have to make sure you wipe it all off when you use a warm cloth to remove it. It worked good to remove my sunscreen as well as my makeup looks. It didn't struggle with removing my mascara nor liquid lippie. The consistency feels like an oil that's solidified. It's not greasy and didn't break me out.  I have sensitive skin and will break out when using new products if i'm not lucky. You only have to use the smallest amount as it spreads out easily and you can work it into your skin with the minimal effort. It leaves my skin very soft when I'm done. The scent isn't overwhelming and dissipates within a minute after using it or massaging it over your face. You only need to use the smallest amount at one time. I've been using it for over a month and barely used a quarter of the jar yet. For the price if you want a balm that will remove your most stubborn makeup and last a good while, it's worth it if you have the money. I will get it again once I use up my other balms after I finish this one up."

			"review_text": "This cleansing balm is a real game-changer. It’s not a regular cleansing balm, it’s 3-in-1: the balm transforms into oil once it meets the warmth of your skin and when you add some water to it, it turns into milk. The formula is fantastic – it scoops easily either with a finger or a spatula. You need an almond-sized amount of the product or even less, as a little goes a long way. The balm melts very fast and glides smoothly on the skin. It also emulsifies easily, so it doesn’t take much effort to cleanse the whole face. The balm starts breaking makeup instantly, thus no rubbing or extra pressure needed.  It removes any kind of makeup, including long-lasting, with ease. While it’s extremely nourishing and moisturizing, it doesn’t leave a greasy film on my skin or eyes, which is vital for me. It also doesn’t sting or irritate the eyes. The balm washes off without a trace removing all the makeup, grease and dirt that accumulates on the face during the day. The skin looks very clean and feel very smooth afterward.  As I wear sunscreen every day and reapply it during the day, it’s important to me so that the cleanser would be able to deal with it too. And the Elemis Cleansing Balm does the job like no other. No clogged pores or breakouts have been detected after I started using it. Instead, it looks like my skin has become much clearer and more radiant. I also love to leave it on for a longer period (around 10 mins) so it works as a mask. After I take it off, the skin feels incredibly nourished, soft and pampered. Last but not least, it has a quite distinct fresh smell, I think it’s eucalyptus. Personally, I love it, as it makes the makeup removal process feel even more pleasant. This balm has become an integral part of my skincare routine and I’m not planning to switch it up for anything else."

You need a very small amount that you will warm up in the palms of your hand the balm starts as a solid becomes an oil and with just a splash of water turns into a milky consistency. Then use a cloth to remove and your skin is left feeling so hydrated and clean ( not stripped),"

I also really enjoy the scent although I can see how it might not be for everyone since it's pretty strong. It smells spa-like to me. My favorite way to use it if I have an extra minute at night is to rub it enough to start breaking down my makeup and then take a hot wet washcloth and lay it over my face. It feels and smells so relaxing and I think the heat and moisture in the washcloth help to break up the makeup. After a minute, I just wipe everything off and it leaves my skin clean and super soft."

Don't worry, the scent does not linger after removal so you can layer on any other products you need. I also wear mascaras that do not smudge or bleed so removal can be a chore. The directions caution against use around the eyes but I was able to remove my toughest mascaras with success and no eye issues.

Initially, I didn't quite understand the hype around it (after my first container), but since I received it for review, I decided to give it another shot. I do prefer an oil-based balm, like the one from Farmacy, for makeup removal, but this balm isn't bad. However, it does require more effort to remove makeup. It takes extra time, especially for heavier or waterproof makeup around the eyes. I've deducted one star due to the added time it adds to my routine and the price. At $69, it feels expensive, especially since the jar doesn't always come filled. Nonetheless, I like how it leaves my skin feeling hydrated and non-stripped. Overall, I would recommend this if you have the budget, but if not, more affordable options are available for makeup removal."

I can’t rate this full stars because compared to other cleansing balms this doesn’t remove some more troublesome makeup types like waterproof eyeliner and mascara. In the photo I have some swatches: eyeliner, liquid blush, liquid highlighter, liquid eyeshadow, and a pigmented staining lipstick. I used the remover on the left side of the swatches. You can see the fully pigmented version of each swatch to the right. You can see the blush and eyeliner didn’t wipe away nearly as easily. It took more soaking and rubbing to get those off.

I loved the consistency of this one as it was more like a gel than a typical balm and emulsified into a nice lather that wasn’t too harsh or drying. This will become my go-to balm for the winter months when my combination skin needs that moisture that other balms can’t always provide. It didn’t leave any sticky residue like some other gel cleansers can and felt gentle around my eyes."

It doesn’t leave any greasy residue behind, just clean, refreshed skin. My skin has felt more hydrated and radiant since adding this to my routine.  If you’re looking for a makeup remover that’s effective, gentle, and gives your skin a soft glow, I highly recommend giving this a try.

Definitely recommend."

A lot of cleansing balms tend to focus on removing make up but this one feels like it's actually doing something good for your skin."

When I put it on the first couple of times it felt tingly but after the first few times I didn’t feel it anymore. I didn’t mind the tingling feeling- it made me feel like the product was doing its job. This product requires a few more steps when applying because you have to unscrew the lid, scoop out the product, apply, and then put the lid back on versus just a melting make up spray but in my opinion this product is worth it. It does a fabulous job taking my makeup off and cleaning the dirt in my pores while leaving my skin feeling refreshed. I would recommend this product to makeup and beauty lovers everywhere."

I, however, have dry skin and tea tree oil tends to dry me out. I only used it twice so I could give an honest review, but I ended up giving it to my acne prone daughter who loves it. I'm also a bit of a bargain makeup consumer, and the price tag is pretty off-putting. I feel like you're paying for the pretty jar and the brand name more than the product. a simple package is fine with most of us to save on the cost! That said, if you're willing to pay the asking price and are looking for high-quality eye makeup remover, look no further! Elemis is an amazing brand that delivers potent products that always do what they say they will! Just, maybe try a different additive than the tea tree (or whatever that extra scent is)."

I immediately could smell the cleansing balm and it was heavenly! It smells very clean with hints of essential oils like lavender and eucalyptus. I felt like I was in a very nice spa! When I use the cleansing balm, the texture feels so smooth. It feels SO soft and is soothing on the skin. I am impressed with how it takes my makeup off after a long day. When it is time to wash the cleansing balm off, using warm water and a cloth to gently wipe it off, the smell stays around, even until the day after! I would highly recommend purchasing this product to pamper your skin! I received this product as part of a free sampling program."

It smelled great but there seemed to be some sort of menthol and my eyes did not react well. Thankfully the naked balm didn’t have that issue. I was amazed watching my eye makeup just melt off with the balm before I even added water. Fragrance free the balm felt gentle had nourishing on my skin; felt so moisturized and supple after use.

The smell is a lovely rose - but if scented products aren’t your thing I would imagine this might be too overpowering. It has a creamy consistency that goes on smoothly. The way a warmed up oil glides over your skin - but this doesn’t leave an oily feel. It did a fantastic job of getting off all of my waterproof mascara which tends to be a struggle for me with other cleansers. I LOVE that I can open my eyes while using this (to check if I’ve gotten everything off) without a soapy burn to my eyes. Yes, it is pricey but a little goes a long way! I only used a dime size amount to take off the right side of my makeup in this picture photo and it came off in one wipe of my washcloth. Pretty impressive work on waterproof mascara!"

I first tried this makeup cleansing balm with an entire face was covered in rhinestones and my body was covered in paint. This cleansing balm was able to remove all the makeup, rhinestones & body paint with ease. Usually I would not be able to remove rhinestones with a cleansing balm, I would need to use spirit gum remover or micellar water to get them off, but they came off easily with this cleansing balm. My usual makeup removal routine consists of a cleansing balm, several makeup remover wipes & micellar water to remove all my makeup. This cleansing balm by Elemis literally removes everything, so you won't need any other products. When I tell you, a little goes a long way with this product, all you need is a dime to a quarter-sized amount, massage it into your face & then wipe with a microfiber face cloth, and the makeup is gone. I've tried this product again with fewer rhinestones and a full face of makeup, and it was still able to get the job done. It literally leaves behind little to no makeup. Also, it has a very light and pleasing smell, and it leaves your face with a nice glow. This product is absolutely my new go-to product in my makeup removal routine."

I think it’s the fragrance. Other than that it has an amazing texture, works superbly and the fragrance itself actually smells great!

I began using the product on while I still had my makeup on it had a Vaseline like texture and was smooth to the face.It made my face very shiny and smooth and once I removed it with the washcloth my skin stayed that same smooth texture my makeup also washed off very easily while using this product.

			"review_text": "lright, I’ve been holding off on this review because I wanted to see how things went after a few days and a full face of makeup.  First off, I was totally bracing myself for a blast of fragrance when I opened the package. Guess what? Nada. Unlike most of Elemis’ products, the Naked Cleanser truly lives up to its name with zero added fragrance. My nose and skin are both doing a happy dance—no irritation here!  Now, let’s talk texture. It’s a balm, kind of like a thin, meltable Vaseline. Pro tip: don’t do what I did and slap it on like you’re icing a cake. A little goes a long way!  On my first try, I smeared it on my face, added a splash of water, and it turned into a milky, cleansing wonder. Think oil cleanser, but better.  It easily wiped away the day’s grime on my no-makeup face, so naturally, I put it to the ultimate test the next day: a full face of makeup. And let me tell you, this stuff is now my holy grail. It just melts the makeup right off like magic.  In summary, this cleanser is a gem. No added fragrance, leaving your skin fresh and irritation-free, ready for whatever skincare concoctions you’ve got lined up next. Whether you use it as a first cleanse in a multi-step routine or as your main squeeze, it’ll slide right into your regimen with no fuss."

It's incredibly gentle yet highly effective. A small amount goes a long way, easily removing a full face of makeup, including stubborn mascara. After use, my skin feels smooth and revitalized, maintaining its natural oils without any dryness. While the rose scent is quite noticeable — which I personally enjoy — it's worth noting for those sensitive to fragrances. This product has earned a permanent place in my nightly skincare routine.

It not only removes makeup and cleanses the skin but also doubles as a rejuvenating facial mask. I love how it deeply cleanses and softens my skin, giving it a revitalized and youthful appearance.  I can confidently say that the Elemis Pro-Collagen Makeup Melting Cleansing Balm has become an essential part of my skincare routine.

Also, I did experience a breakout after testing a few Elemis products, so I can’t pinpoint what from them caused it specifically, BUT, this balm does contain coconut oil, which isn’t non-comedogenic & I usually avoid it. So I wouldn’t recommend this for acne-prone skin (which I am not). I like the other ingredients tho & the strong lavender oil scent doesn’t bother me, but I’m sure it will others. Btw, mine came melted to one side of the jar with a little oil separation. Not a huge deal, but not an enjoyable or luxury experience either. I’m probably going to gift this to a friend."

If your eyes are sensitive perhaps try one of the unscented ones, but the balms are the best! They are so emollient, melting down into a rich oil, then milky- they will take off the toughest makeup!! And you will NOT feel tight & dry after cleansing. A little bit goes a long way, this will last forever. Definitely recommend these balms! Gifted by Elemis."

Created to change from a balm to an oil & then a hydrating milk once water makes contact with it. Key ingredients include English Rose Oleo Extract: (smooths & hydrates skin), Elderberry Oil (contains fatty acids & antioxidants), & Padina Pavonica (moisturizes & adds radiance to skin).    My experience: I have combination-oily, acne prone, sensitive skin. I’ve been using this nightly for two weeks. It’s a yellow balm with a delightful rose scent that when applied to your skin it becomes a slippery oil that visibly melts away makeup in front of your eyes. It doesn’t leave any residue behind & is easy to wash off. Leaves my skin soft, moisturized & clean with makeup removed. I LOVE the rose scent more than the original herbal scent & will be repurchasing.   Overall: I absolutely love the rose version of this cult classic collagen cleansing balm. The rose scent is delightful & the balm leaves my skin cleansed, moisturized, & soft. I will be repurchasing soon. 5.0/5.0"

It leaves my skin feeling soft and smooth without being greasy or drying out my skin. If I had to choose between the rose-scented version and the original, I would opt for the original as scented products can sometimes cause slight irritation. I did not encounter any significant issues with this one."

This cleansing balm is a game-changer in my nightly skincare routine. The balm itself has a rich, luxurious feel that quickly melts into an oil when applied to the skin. It effectively dissolves all my makeup, even waterproof eyeliner and mascara, without any harsh scrubbing. The scent is light and soothing, making the cleansing process feel like a mini spa treatment. What I appreciate most about this product is how my skin feels after using it. It leaves my face feeling clean, soft, and hydrated, without any greasy residue. I’ve noticed my skin looks more radiant and feels more supple since I started using it. Plus, it’s gentle enough that it hasn’t caused any breakouts or irritation, which is often a concern for my combination skin. The packaging is elegant and practical, with a secure lid that keeps the balm fresh. A little goes a long way, so the jar lasts quite a while, making it a good value for the price. Overall, the Elemis Pro-Collagen Makeup Melting Cleansing Balm has become a staple in my skincare routine. It’s effective, luxurious, and leaves my skin looking and feeling fantastic. Highly recommend!"

			"review_text": "I recently had the pleasure of trying out the Elemis Pro-Collagen Rose Cleansing Balm gifted to me by skeepers! I must say, it has been a game-changer in my skincare routine. Texture and Application: The balm has a rich, luxurious texture that melts effortlessly into the skin. Upon application, it transforms into a silky oil that glides over the face, making it easy to massage and remove makeup and impurities. The product comes with a soft cleansing cloth, which adds a gentle exfoliating step to the routine. Fragrance: One of the standout features of this cleansing balm is its divine rose scent. It’s subtle and not overpowering, providing a calming, spa-like experience every time I use it. The fragrance is derived from English Rose Oleo Extract, which adds to its natural and soothing appeal. Performance: In terms of performance, the Elemis Pro-Collagen Rose Cleansing Balm excels. It effectively removes even the most stubborn makeup, including waterproof mascara, without stripping the skin of its natural oils. After use, my skin feels deeply cleansed, soft, and hydrated. There’s no greasy residue left behind, which is a major plus. Ingredients: This balm is formulated with a blend of rose and mimosa waxes, elderberry, starflower, and optimega oils. These ingredients work together to nourish and hydrate the skin while cleansing. Additionally, it contains anti-aging properties, thanks to the inclusion of Padina Pavonica, a powerful marine extract known for its collagen-boosting benefits. Value for Money: While the Elemis Pro-Collagen Rose Cleansing Balm is on the pricier side, I believe it’s worth the investment. The quality of the ingredients, combined with the luxurious experience it offers, makes it a standout product in the realm of skincare. A little goes a long way, so a single jar lasts quite a while. Final Thoughts: Overall, the Elemis Pro-Collagen Rose Cleansing Balm is a must-try for anyone looking to elevate their cleansing routine. It’s perfect for all skin"

			"review_text": "I’ve always been curious about trying this since it’s such a cult-favorite, but because there are so many other amazing cleansing balms out there for a way more affordable price, I’m not sure if this one stacks up. I will say you get a lot of product, the scent is spa-like, it melts down easily, and turns into a really beautiful milky consistency when you add water. It also totally does its job of removing makeup, sunscreen, etc. Again, I’m just not sure if it’s worth it for the price. It’s not as thick as I was expecting, so I feel like it could even be in a squeeze tube or something for easier access (this would also be more hygienic). Also, since this is a rinse-off product (I use it as the first step in my double cleanse) you’re not getting a ton of the added collagen claims. It’s definitely not bad, but there are so many other cleansing balms out there that give the same end result for cheaper. This would mainly be worth it for the more senzorial aspects (scent, milkiness, etc)."

The Elemis Pro-Collagen Rose Cleansing Balm is an exceptional addition to any skincare routine, offering a trifecta of benefits: hydrating, soothing, and cleansing. From the first use, it’s clear this balm is a lovely product, with a delicate rose scent that transforms a mundane task into a pampering ritual. Formulated with a trio of nourishing plant oils—Elderberry, Optimega™, and Bee Friendly Starflower oil—this balm provides an intense hydration boost. These oils work together to deeply moisturize the skin, leaving it feeling soft and supple. The addition of Padina Pavonica, a powerful algae extract, may promote skin elasticity and a youthful glow. The balm’s texture is rich and velvety, melting into a silky oil upon application. It effortlessly dissolves makeup and impurities, ensuring a thorough yet gentle cleanse. Unlike many cleansers that can leave skin feeling tight and dry, this balm remains hydrated and nourished. The balm is easy to remove with either water or a warm cloth, and it leaves no greasy residue, only a smooth, radiant complexion. Overall, the Elemis Pro-Collagen Rose Cleansing Balm is a top-tier skincare product that lives up to its promises. It delivers a soft, hydrated, and glowing complexion. Though it comes with a premium price tag, the results and experience it offers make it a worthy investment for those seeking luxurious and effective skincare."

The smell is AMAZING, the consistency is like a solid face oil, and what I noticed is that you have to warm it up for like 10 seconds and massage it on to your face for like 30 seconds to really remove your makeup. I was not a fan of the consistency because I have combo skin but for a dry skin one, this will probably be a lot better."

Unlike some other balms, this one has a buttery soft texture that melts right into my face. I love how this cleansing balm has the most relaxing scents of lavender and eucalyptus - my partner loves smelling my face after I wash it. My face is guaranteed to feel soft and hydrated after this 1st cleanse. Yes, this balm is pricey, but I highly recommend it because it is effective and a little product goes a long way! Those with allergies or sensitivities, the balm contains essential oils, fragrance, almond oil, oat oil, coconut oil and wheat germ oil"

It does tug a bit on my face, but once it starts to work into the skin it’s easier. Once you use wet hands to work it into the skin, it starts to milk up and break down makeup.
