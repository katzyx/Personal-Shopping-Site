I have incorporated other new bond treatments like K18 into my routine, but only within this last year. I don‚Äôt see a reason not to use both because they are very different treatments! I have long (mid back) dark brown hair that I bleached religiously every 6 weeks for several years. I had fully white long hair that whole time. When I didn‚Äôt use olaplex, my hair got worse. I now do a more heavy balayage and it still works. I barely cut anything off my ends at my recent salon visit. The stuff works. A trick if you are worried about hair loss would be, don‚Äôt brush it through your wet hair (take sections and rub/massage it in). I have lost less hair when I use olaplex than when I don‚Äôt. So, like anything, I think it just depends on your hair. Also this is not a moisturizer! If you don‚Äôt have damage, this won‚Äôt do anything for you! So many of my friends say things about not liking it but when I ask how they use it, they generally use it incorrectly or they don‚Äôt have color treated hair and no real damage. I will actually use Step 0, 3 and 8 on the day I plan to wash my hair and leave it in for hours. I do like some other masks more than step 8, but step 3 is the OG and it‚Äôs just good stuff!"

I hadn't read other reports of this happening so immediately started making other changes: (ie hard water filters on showehead, diet changes, hair supplements) but, then one day after using NO 3 & seeing a lot breakoff almost immediately, I googled it and was stunned. I then immediately discontinued use and nearly 7 mo later my hair rebounded completely. (sections that broke off mid length made me have to cut it & start over)   never imagined that using products that would supposedly make my already thick, relatively healthy (altho chemically treated), long hair even better could do so much damage....both to hair and emotionally. Womens identity & hair is interwoven, something i learned 1st hand--its devastating & scary.   It's not worth the risk guys. like I said, it felt like it was helping initially. (placebo possibly?) Then bam! My hair looked so awful I couldn't even leave the house. didn't go 'out' w.o hats for nearly a YEAR.

I do think people can have allergic reactions to a product like this, but  as someone who been lightening  their hair for 20 plus years I can assure you this is not whats making your hair fall out. If by chance it is,  its only because you are using it WAY too much. . It's meant to be used once every two weeks or so. If you hair is falling out its either from the damage from lightening it (literally bleach will break your hair) stress, hormones, diet, or an allergic reaction. This product has restored the health of my hair in dramatic ways and i use it maybe 2 times a month. Pretty much every blonde i know uses this and praises its function. Always be wary of trying new products, but this formula has not changed in 10 plus years and now all of a sudden these claims are surfacing like crazy??"

I also used the shampoo and conditioner (no 4 and 5) from Olaplex. I used this Product 2 times (and the shampoo/conditioner 4 times since I only wash my hair 2 times a week). And these two times were enough to cause this breakage. I take extremely good care of my hair I rarely use heat, wash it 2 a week, trim it every 6-8 weeks and only use products from salons so I was so disappointed that after only 2 times my hair was starting to fall out from my ponytail because more than half of the length broke off and didn't reach into the ponytail anymore.

Long story short I wanted to go very blonde and ended up having my hair over bleached in the process. Decided to stop with the bleach after that but my hair was very, VERY damaged.   Just no. 3 alone worked pretty well but once I incorporated all of the above steps in my weekly full wash routine my results were amazing. I do only wash once a week typically so Olaplex is all I use then style with Verb products. I have Frizz free defined curls for days.   Very little breakage despite the significant bleach damage. Of course my mids and ends are damaged and I can tell when it‚Äôs wet. I‚Äôve been gradually cutting off the damage and decided no more bleach. I tried using K18 and that was a disaster for me. Did not work at all. I think my thick long curly hair needs the moisture of all the Olaplex steps so I keep going back and it works wonderfully for me.

Then my hair snapped off, all 10-14 inches like a halo. Then my hair began to fall out from the root . And then it caused my scalp to get red and inflamed and my hair fell out in giant patches , my entire hairline also fell out. This stuff either causes Alopecia or  it mimics Alopecia. I stopped using it and my hair is no longer falling out and my ‚ÄúAlopecia areata and female pattern baldness and frontal fibrosing alopecia and what looked like traction Alopecia ‚Äù is miraculously gone smh.

I even cut on my coloring services to 2-3 times a year since I thought I needed to baby my hair even more to minimize any potential damage,  but my hair continued breaking and became even more dull and frizzy. Luckily, stumble upon some articles and threads of other girls saying that some Olaplex products caused damage, allergic reactions, and even boldness. After stopping using it a couple months  ago and clarifying my hair, saw a dramatic improvement in texture. Whatever is in Olaplex product causes severe hair damage for some."

It took me a while to realize my fair was falling out in clumps in the shower, even on days I used other shampoos so I never suspected Olaplex. I went on a long journey of supplements, silk pillowcases, sulfate-free shampoos, you name it. Eventually I healed my scalp with anti-fungal methods. My hair was so thin and stringy that I haven't gone out with my hair down since. This was 2019-2020. Since then, the shedding had not come back, and the new growth has been healthier but the ends are still so thin and stringy. I got highlights three moths ago and since my lengths are so sad, I figured... maybe Olaplex would help! So I started using a tiny bit of #3 as a leave-in (lengths only) a few times a week a month or two ago. Well, my lengths look horrible, and I just noticed my hair is falling out again. OMG. I searched if Olaplex can cause hair loss and found so many other women with stories, results and pictures just like mine. For reference, I have fine, slightly wavy hair. I feel so sad for all the money and all the bad hair years wasted. I have to start the healing journey again and I'm needless to say never touching Olaplex again. I am interested in joining the class-action lawsuit."

Too long to hang in the shower and too short to get out its weird but I know it doesn't work as well on dirty hair so I shampoo and let it sit while I shave and wash my body and then just stand there for another five min which is annoying.

In the last few years, I've damaged my hair by using too much heat, and getting it colored too often. So I've embarked on a journey to repair my hair. Already having reduced my heat usage and getting my hair colored, I purchased almost the entire line of Olaplex hair products.  The first time I used this product, I carefully followed the directions, I applied this 25 minutes to all of my hair prior to shampooing, then used the Olaplex shampoo and conditioner, the deep conditioner, then followed with the leave-in conditioner, the bonding oil, and the serum.  Based on the other reviews of people being absolutely wowed, I thought by using all of the products together, I'd be wowed as well.  I used this product for a good 2-3 months in addition to most of the Olaplex line. I was never wowed and didn't see much of a difference in my hair. My hair just might be resistant to protein treatments or something but I wish I would have had better results. Giving 3 stars because this didn't damage my hair it all, but I wouldn't purchase this again."

Upon first putting a small dollop into my hand and feeling the consistency I knew immediately it wasn't the same product I had used 4 years ago. It has the texture of those cheap lotions they give you at low end hotels that dissipate upon rubbing your palms together. It's EXTREMELY thin and doesn't lather well at all. It made me feel like I applied cheap shampoo to my hair and didn't give that silky smooth feeling as before 4 years ago. If you care about the integrity of your hair I highly suggest you stay far away from this product. Returning mine tomorrow for a hair product that's actually worth $30."

But for the love of gawd and the precious hair on your head, DO NOT USE more than once a week and even then. Stop when your hair feels good. Start small and don‚Äôt put it in for an hour, even with as severely damaged hair as mine.   Long story short, I went from black to lavender hair. Two years straight bleach. Hair like straw. My stylist recommended this product to me. ‚ÄúUse it every time you shower‚Äù. Being bleached, I washed twice a week, worked wonderful for a few months until my hair started breaking off anytime I touched, combed, took a shower, etc. I ended going from long, full bodied hair to a sorry, thin mullet. Could not control the protein damage after shampooing for a few months with this line. Went to my hairstylist later, who was trying to fix my mullet without going to a pixie cut, then mentioned ‚Äúoh yeah I heard too much protein can also break your hair.‚Äù   SMDH!  Word to the wise, use sparingly and never more than 10 min. It‚Äôs been over a year of me trying to grow my hair back now and I try not to get superficial about looks, but just something about the crown on your head that can make you feel like a million bucks or very sad. Yes, even tho hair grows back, but that was a lesson I wish I could have avoided."

			"review_text": "A little background on my hair concerns: My hair texture is straight with a slight wave, my strands are fine, and little volume. I have a sensitive scalp, oily roots, & dry brittle ends that are prone to breakage/frizz. My shoulder-length hair is color-treated.  In terms of packaging, the No 3. Hair Perfector is a simple plastic bottle with a flip cap. The design on the bottle is super simple - which is often a sign that the product will really speak for itself‚Ä¶ and it does.   APPLICATION: This product does have a learning curve in terms of how to maximize results.  I like to gently brush my hair prior to wetting my hair. I rinse my hair from root to ends. Then I apply a generous amount of the product from root to tips‚Ä¶. the key word here is ‚Äò‚Äôgenerous.‚Äô‚Äô The product needs to saturate the strands otherwise I won‚Äôt see a benefit after showering. I‚Äôve noticed the best results when I leave the product on my hair for 10-15 min underneath a shower cap prior to washing out. The results are noticeably shinier hair that is less frizzy-looking.  RESULTS: The formula doesn‚Äôt weigh my hair fine hair down nor does it cause irritation on my sensitive scalp. The dry, frizzy ends of my hair feel nourished and my hair looks shiny and healthy. The product doesn‚Äôt strip my hair, but I do need to use color maintenance products in my routine to keep color from fading with each wash.  FINAL THOUGHTS: Is this actually ‚Äòrepairing‚Äô my hair? Probably not since hair is dead after it grows out from the root; however, the results make my hair look and feel healthier.  If you have thicker or longer hair (as in hair that is past your shoulders), I‚Äôd imagine you‚Äôd run through a bottle of the No. 3 Perfector fairly quickly; however, for my shoulder length, fine hair, a bottle will last me roughly 6 weeks or so with once-a-week usage.   Would I repurchase? At this point, I‚Äôve bought 3 bottles of the No. 3 Hair Perfector to help support my hair health."

Is it exoensaie for the amount you get and (if you have longer hair like me) use-yes‚Ä¶but i will continue to use it until a good dupe is found!!"

I recommend using olaplex number 0 before using olaplex number 3 once a week on 5 day old hair. You can‚Äôt use one without the other, In my opinion olaplex number 0, 3, & 8 will give you the best results.  Remember to read instructions before applying any of the  products."

The strands are extremely thin and brittle. Any time I shower I now lose strands and clumps of hair in my brush. I have always had very thick long hair (almost to my butt). My hair looks awful and thin, I wish there was some type of class action suit for this brand. It has ruined my confidence and mentally exhausts me on a daily basis, I have cried brushing my hair after the shower and it has def given me some depression. DO NOT USE AT ANY COSTS"

I ran out of it for a couple months and decided to try the No.6 and it's not the same whatsoever. My hair was noticeably drier and fairly broken, I couldn't for the life of me figure out why and it was because I stopped using the No.3. I do have mildly damaged hair from bleaching it so split ends were bound to happen, but using this product helped manage them 10x better than without. I also use less products throughout the week, such as hair oils and detanglers, because managing my hair is easier after each use.

			"review_text": "I was someone who used to think that nothing could actually repair the bonds of your hair from the inside, especially because it went against everything I ever learned in cosmetology school, but that was 30 years ago and technology has changed, the proof is in the chemistry.  I completely clarified my hair and then started using only Olaplex products exclusively. I used the entire line as recommended for damaged hair for 4 months, including number one in my hair color touch ups, and now I am a firm believer that it really does repair bonds as they claim because there is no other explanation for the positive change in my mid back length, color treated, and highlighted hair.   I went from dull hair that was always tangled and broke so easily, to much healthier, shiny, soft, full hair.   Despite having a lot of hair, it's very fine and before Olaplex, I could never achieve fullness without using a ton of product which was counterproductive.   Usually conditioners, treatments, and masks, would weigh my hair down, but not Olaplex, it gives me the natural fullness I want without any styling product or weighing my hair down.   And their purple shampoo, I can't say enough good things about it either! It is super concentrated so you need only the tiniest bit for the best results and the fact that the other products help color last longer, you don't need to use it as often as other toning shampoos, but when they say leave it on no more than two minutes, they mean it! If you use too much or leave it in too long, it will tint your hair rather than just tone it.   The only Olaplaex product I don't use is the oil. Other than that, they would have to pry Olaplex from my hands.   I highly recommend the entire line and starting with completely clarified hair prior to starting and use Olaplex exclusively for a few months to achieve the best results.   I honestly believe the bad reviews are a result of user error rather than product error. You must start with clarified hair."

Said it looks like I have completely different hair ,) It a winner winner chicken dinner‚Ä¶. Sitting in my car after night shift and it dark and hair is now up so can‚Äôt take a pic JUST DO IT BUY THIS AND TRY"

I‚Äôve tried several other brands for hair shine and this one outshines them all . I‚Äôve tried the whole olaplex line and IMO the 0+3 are the best products for my hair in their line (the rest Are ok but there are better out there )  I have a small section that is partially bleached white and the rest has only been colored with with Demi-permanent  brown  gloss (my hair is naturally fine dark brown)  - I don‚Äôt notice the shine on the bleached sections but it is really apparent on the brown.  This takes me about two hours for the whole process  - I wash my hair with a clarifying shampoo then towel dry and then apply the 0 for 10 min then a good amount of the 3 and leave it in a bag for over an hour then wash it out and condition with the olaplex conditioner. I‚Äôd give it four stars but the price is high especially since you really need to use the 0 to see a difference   And it only has about 4-5 applications worth for my fine textured shoulder length hair. But so far I haven‚Äôt found a better product for hair shine - it lasts in my hair maybe a week (I wash my hair every 2-3 days ) since I don‚Äôt go anywhere these days I do it once a month or before special occasions but once everything opens up and if I have time time I‚Äôd probably do it once a week ."

Now, here‚Äôs where I‚Äôm just not sure‚Ä¶ did olaplex actually do anything? My hair doesn‚Äôt appear less frizzy or feel softer but perhaps I have fewer split ends or my hair is a bit shinier than it was before? Or maybe my hair is a bit ‚Äústronger‚ÄùI don‚Äôt know. I find it difficult to measure!  I use the product approx every two weeks and have been using for over a year. I think it‚Äôs difficult to measure the effects when you use it more sparingly and over a long period of time. Or.. perhaps it isn‚Äôt doing much?! I don‚Äôt know!  Honestly, I‚Äôll probably continue to use the product. I would like to believe it‚Äôs doing something for my long frizzy hair.  I wonder if the dramatic effect is reserved for folks who have damaged bleached hair? I have virgin hair that I rarely style so maybe the effect just isn‚Äôt as dramatic."

			"review_text": "I have tried many repair products for my fragile, fine, thin hair.  When my hair starts breaking, the ends look even more thin and the damage is very noticable on straight type 1A hair.  When you are really desperate to rescue your hair, cost is less of a concern than effectiveness.  I was hopeful about Olaplex #3 because my colorist adds #1 and #2 to my process in salon; however, the #3 was disappointing at home.  I used the product twice and saw no difference in the strength or health of my hair.  I recently tried K18 and it was mind-blowing how much it improved my damage after the first use.  K18 is the only product I have ever tried that literally stopped my hair from breaking off.  After blow-drying, my sink used to be littered with pieces of broken hair, but since I have been using K18 - no pieces on my sink at all.  I listed all of my repair products, including my Olpalex 3, on my Posh closet, because the only one I need now is the K18."

			"review_text": "Olaplex claimed their products worked on chemically treated hair but to be honest all it did was revert my relaxed hair and I‚Äôm very mad about it. I relax my hair because my roots are coarse, coarse to the point it sometimes mats up and it beyond difficult to detangle. I touched up my roots one month ago which is when I first used the product, I purchased numbers 3, 6 and 8. The first time using it I didn‚Äôt notice any results which was fine because it was my first time. The second time using it it fried my hair and reverted my straight roots back to coarse and I don‚Äôt like that. When I part my hair it looks like hair was fried off of my head. I‚Äôll be returning the products even if I can‚Äôt get my money back."

			"review_text": "I don‚Äôt know what some of these negative reviews are about but thank God I didn‚Äôt let them discourage me from trying the products. They have literally been LIFE CHANGING. I have relaxed hair that was dry and brittle for the last couple years. I couldn‚Äôt figure out what the issue was.. would alternate between protein and moisture treatments each week (I have an arsenal of high quality hair products and do minimal heat styling). Despite this, I had tons of split ends and my hair felt like straw. I used to stretch for long periods (5-6 mos) between relaxers, which in hindsight I realized was doing more damage than good. Although I got length, my hair was breaking a lot and had thinned diffusely. I have used the no 3 perfector along with no 0 for the past 3 months and I can honestly say my hair has never been better. Once I saw these positive changes in my hair, decided to splurge and get the no 4 shampoo, no 5 conditioner, no 6 bond smoother and the no 7 bonding oil‚Ä¶.. listeeennnnn!!! Used them once all together after my last relaxer and I immediately knew I did something right. My wet hair was much more manageable. Once dried, it was SMOOTH, noticeably stronger, bouncy and so shiny! Olaplex has been a savior for me! If you have damaged hair, give it a try."

This works wonders on my hair and my extensions. It always feels really soft and shiny after I use it. Here is the best way I have found to use it, as I have tried multiple ways and as directed. wash my hair with shampoo to get off any buildup so the product and penetrate properly. Get out of the shower and pat my hair dry with a towel. Saturate my hair with this product. I have noticed that if I skimp with the product, it doesn‚Äôt work as well. Hair must be SATURATED with this. Wait for an hour at least or longer. Wash out, don‚Äôt shampoo, and condition. Continue on with regular hair care routine. I will never not use this product. As mentioned, I‚Äôve tried a bunch of ways to use this and this is the best method for my brittle broken hair. This is the only product that makes my hair less frizzy and dry feeling."
