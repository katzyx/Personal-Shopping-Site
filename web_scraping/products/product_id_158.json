It removed most but not all of my scalp buildup and didn't irritate my scalp in the process. The hair mask works very well. My curls are hydrated, shiny, and happy and I didn't even use curl cream. It's heavy, so I'll be using this once a week going forward. I have thick hair in density and hair strand thickness and 2c/3a curls that tend towards being dry."

The don't despair repair on the other end, I like to use in place of my conditioner, my hair always come out so soft and nourished.
