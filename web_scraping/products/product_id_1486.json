			"review_text": "This perfume is definitely a different formula than other old skylar perfumes. I put on way too much and was surprised cause I used to have to be able to do that with old perfumes but it's really strong now. You can for sure smell it all day and I couldn't even rub it off. That being said... I don't LOVE the scent. It doesn't warm up really on the skin and I would only wear this for special occasions as it is very cologne like. I like it for that purpose but it is not a perfume I would reach for as it's not very feminine. I really wish perfumes that had tree/earth notes didn't all smell like cologne, is there not a way to make it feminine?"
