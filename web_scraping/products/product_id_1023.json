Beautifully green, like straight up walking through a forest with cedar and vetiver in the opening but also clean; with a soapy and lightly sweet and mildly musty dry down. Lots of comparisons to Santal 33 but this stands alone to me. Unisex but slightly femme leaning, warmer as well. I love this, but it's doesn't match my vibe, I almost exclusively reach for it on rainy fall days or when I want to cosplay as mysterious and unbothered."

I am one of the very few that when I smell sandalwood I smell pickles so it does have a pickle smell to me as well so if you’re one of the ones that smell sand wood in that way, just forewarned, it may smell like pickles."

When I smell this the only thing I get is cucumbers, and not in a pleasant way. THATS IT. Borderline pickle.

It reminds me of spending summer with my grandparents. This scent has a specific aesthetic about it. I don't hate it. This is a scent that feels best for layering! It's the kind of scent you use for a base note and pair with something flowery or maybe citrus to blend out. It is highly unique. With layering the scent you can create your own specific smell that I promise will be very specific to you. It takes some playing with to decide your perfect combo. For instance, I love when I pair it with vanilla scent. I also found successful with Marc Jacobs or Chanel number 5. When I paired it with the Channel number 5, I was surprised that the match actually reminded me of the it reminded me of the iconic scent “Dimonds are forever” by Elizabeth Taylor. Which made a very classy scent that I would wear formally. I had to play with it to decide what I prefered best. So, I would purchase with the intent to layer."

Not only do the folks at Maison Louis Marie help the planet, they have a beautiful family history that is most definitely worth delving into! We can start with the intentionally simple packaging. The white boxes are adorn with a seal that the product creators Grandfather created. Lovely. The company does not spend their money on packaging as they prefer to keep it simple and let the product organically speak for itself.

But it is way more complex than that.    The top note of this perfume is sandalwood, which is calming and promotes focus and enhanced memory in aromatherapy.  The mid note of vetiver actually combines in this fragrance to almost a floral jasmine-like scent.  Vetiver is wonderful for relieving stress and anxiety.  The base note of amber wood has to be what draws me to this scent.  Amber wood also has calming effects and increases cognitive function as well as reducing inflamation due to the antioxidants it contains.  We all could use some grounding and calm in our lives, and this fragrance does it for me.  It reminds me of my visit to India with my father years ago.  We would walk the markets and the smell of sandalwood was everywhere. We brought home tiny sandalwood boxes that always took me back to that time.  LOUIS MARIE HOUSE No.04 Bois de Balincourt Eau de Parfum is a refreshing escape from the sugary-sweet or intensely floral scents that seem to be the norm for women's fragrance.

No. 04 Bois de Balincourt is a lot less woodsy from what I anticipated it to be from the notes. It is something that I can wear year-round, since it isn't heavy, like I even wore it in humid 100 degree weather. Its an inoffensive slightly woody airy scent. Think of it as a scent that you can wear post shower during the day. Staying power is only three/ four hours for me though, wish it lasted longer. There is a slight sweetness at the very beginning that disappears quickly, so I can imagine this would layer well with a sweet vanilla scent. No. 04 Bois de Balincourt is a true unisex scent.

This is the second scent I have tried from Maison Louis Marie and upon learning about the scent, figured it was a more musky/masculine leaning scent. The No. 04 Scent Bois de Balincourt perfume smells quite woodsy on first scent, think cedarwood. The first scent is pretty strong, but as it wears throughout the day, it definitely smelled more earthy and a little bit more amber forward. I enjoyed how the scent developed throughout the day and really encourage people to wear it for a full day before forming an opinion on this product.

One of the things I love most about this perfume is its longevity. It lasts all day on my skin, and I often get compliments hours after I've applied it. The fragrance evolves beautifully, revealing its deeper, more complex notes.  The packaging is elegant and minimalist, which reflects the brand's overall aesthetic. The bottle looks chic on my vanity and is also convenient for travel. The only reason I'm not giving it a full 5 stars is that the initial scent can be a bit strong for some people. It takes a few minutes to settle into a more subtle fragrance.  Overall, Balincourt is a fantastic choice for anyone looking for a high-quality fragrance"

No.04 Bois de Balincourt Eau de Parfum is truly unique in that they create a sensory experience with notes that transport you to feeling luscious and stunning. For me the notes of vanilla pair so well to feel warm and beautiful. I do think the No.04 Bois de Balincourt Eau de Parfum is very long lasting after only using two sprays I smelled the scent all day. I would wear this daily to have the power of feeling beautiful and full of life. When paying for a parfum you want a great scent and longevity and No.04 Bois de Balincourt Eau de Parfum offers this both perfectly. The branding is stunning and simple. The box is such a nice material but simple. The bottle does not offer any distracting elements as it is straight to the point.

No.04 Bois de Balincourt Eau de Parfum comes in several different sizes in a glass container with clear juice inside. It has a micro sprayer and is pretty convenient to use since all you need is just a couple of shots.   No.04 Bois de Balincourt Eau de Parfum has several notes that I absolutely love which are sandalwood and cedar and the fragrance itself is really balanced. It is gender less and would wear beautifully on everybody.   I usually wear this fragrance by itself but sometimes I like to mix it in with either oud or vetiver oil to go deeper into the notes."

The perfume is definitely meant for the older generation. By this I mean grandparents or elderly. It does have that bougie grandma vibes to it. Scent wise it is very strong. If you are easily prone to headaches I would not suggest this, but if you love people being able to smell you from a mile away, this scent is for you. The perfume wasn't sweet, floral or even fruity which is great for people who do not like sweet scented perfumes but like more mature elegant scents. The packaging though was a very minimalistic beautiful bottle that was easy to use as well. Overall, meant for older people who enjoy strong smelling perfumes."

This fragrance offers a very clean scent profile with a little spiciness that sets it apart from many other perfumes. The spiciness is subtle yet distinctive, providing a sophisticated edge that makes it suitable for various occasions.  One of the most remarkable aspects of No.04 Bois de Balincourt is its longevity. This perfume lasts a long time, often carrying me through an entire day without needing to reapply. It's a testament to its quality and the careful crafting of its formula. For those who value durability in a fragrance, this one certainly delivers.  While I appreciate the overall aroma, I generally prefer scents that have a slightly sweeter note. No.04 Bois de Balincourt leans more towards a fresh and clean scent, which is wonderful in its own right but just a touch away from my ideal fragrance profile. Nevertheless, it has grown on me as a fantastic option for daily use.  The versatility of this perfume is another highlight. Its clean and refined scent makes it appropriate for both casual and professional settings. It's not overpowering, which means it can be worn comfortably in close quarters without overwhelming others, yet it has enough presence to be noticed and appreciated."

It's definitely a unisex fragrance but to me it leans more towards the masculine side. It starts off almost like a mix of banana with a dash of cinnamon, nutmeg, and clove sprinkled on top. There's this musky sweetness to it that's kinda intriguing, albeit a bit unusual. I wouldn't say I'm head over heels for it, but I don't hate it either. The lasting power is impressive though. It hangs around for at least 6 hours which is a big plus. And can we talk about the packaging? It's sleek, minimalist, and downright sexy. They nailed the whole aesthetic vibe.

Unfortunately when I received it I was getting over a cold, so I couldn't really smell it too well. When I did wear it at work I felt the scent was so strange and nauseating. A co-worker them came up and said it smelled musty in the building. I think the smell of ongoing construction was interfering with my perfume and making my feel sick. A few days later I had to go to the hospital and the smells in the hospital plus the perfume were again making me feel sick. I'm not sure if I'm extra sensitive or if something in the perfume is contributing to making me feel this way. I will say that when I first sprayed it and smelled it I felt that it would be better suited for fall or winter since it is a warm scent (it's currently summer). It also smells genderless, I can see a man wearing this no problem. If you really want to try this, maybe start with a travel size spray and see how you feel."

Today I am reviewing this beautiful EDP, I am a beauty enthusiast and enjoy testing and reviewing all things beauty, fragrances are so personal but I will try my best to describe how this scent feels to me personally. My favorite type of scent really depends on my mood and occasion. This scent to me is a perfect fresh and woody scent, with a little bit of citrusy and spicy dry down, warm enough to wear daily, and also great to layer.   The top notes are Sandalwood and Cedarwood, with middle notes being Vetiver, Nutmeg, and Cinnamon, spicy in the best way! The Base note is Amber Wood, which I will say I don't pick up much of this more complex woody scent. It's absolutely one of those scents that will stop someone in their tracks to ask what you are wearing. If you like Clean, Warm, and Woody scents, this one is definitely a must for you."

I was recently graced with that opportunity from MAISON LOUIS MARIE to try their No.4 Bois de Balincourt EDP. This is the second fragrance I've tried from them and the first one(No.14) was a hit, so here's my thoughts on No.4: This perfume is extremely woodsy obviously with the top notes being wood scents, sandal and cedar, which isn't a bad thing if you like the woody scent. I found the base note of amberwood to be very strong on my skin and I did not get nutmeg or cinnamon at all. It didn't last very long either. Like all perfume, it mixes different with everyone's pheromones and it didn't go well with mine. I like the scent but I don't think I'm cut out for woody scents on their own. If you are a floral and or sweet scent lover with just a hint of woody, then this is not the sent for you."

It has a very earthy and citrusy scent. Definitely smells like citronella a lot and is more on the masculine side than the feminine side. Personally, I couldn't smell the cinnamon notes too much which I expected more of and the sandalwood as well. It's a very unisex scent and I prefer it more when it is layered. I highly recommend this perfume to any man because the cedarwood scent is very strong in this fragrance. It would be perfect on any man honestly.

I have noticed with this fragrance that it is very long lasting. I can spray it on and still catch a whiff of the scent hours later. My favorite notes from this scent are the cinnamon and nutmeg. It reminds me of winter and baking. The woodsy scents are a bit too strong for my liking. I am still in the process of discovering what scents suit me best. I have found that I like to match my scents to the season so currently this fragrance does not suit me but I am going to try it more when it starts to cool down a bit and see it the change in weather helps me acclimate to the fragrance more."

This fragrance is completely gender-neutral and is great for wearing alone or for layering. On its own it gives a deep, warm, woody scent that feels cozy and comfortable while remaining subtle and natural. When layered, it adds warmth and depth to any fragrance and pairs wonderfully with nearly any scent family.   The clear glass bottle and simple ivory label look timeless and beautiful displayed on my vanity, and the atomizer sprays an even, fine mist that makes it easy to apply to specific points on the body or all-over.   When worn as a standalone fragrance, this EDP has a deep, intense woody scent upon initial spray and dries down to a gentle skin scent. It lasts several hours on my skin - not all day, but plenty long enough that I don’t feel the need to reapply midday.   Overall, I do really love this scent and am happy with the performance of this EDP, however it’s difficult to recommend this fragrance in particular when there are so many nearly-identical sandalwood fragrances that are more cost-effective and have better projection and longevity.

The longevity is horrible. After an hour, the scent is gone, thinking maybe I had gone nose blind, but even my partner couldn't smell it on me. Performance is a huge part of fragrance wearing and if it doesn't even last an hour, I cannot recommend it. The scent is much lighter than expected.

Doing so turns a sugary sweet perfume into a more sophisticated experience that you can wear anytime. I had my mother try this perfume as well and she enjoyed wearing it on its own. She loves warmer earthier scents that over time melt into the skin and smells fresh and clean like nature after it rains.

I wanted to give this perfume a try for professional settings since it contains notes such as Sandal wood, Vetiver and Amber wood to name a few. I usually like warm scents in my home, which it made it all the more exciting to try.   However, the scent was a bit underwhelming. On initial spray the smell of cinnamon and nutmeg is very strong with some citrusy elements. And as it dries down it becomes slightly sweeter but sadly the scent doesn’t last. Within an hour or so i could barely smell it on me. One repeat application it smelt more and more like a cologne. I know its a unisex fragrance but to me it felt like a male perfume. Also the smell of sandalwood never came through even when applied in the air.   The packaging is very elegant, and i think it would make a nice gift for men who prefer woody scents, especially in the winter months. Unfortunately i don’t think it did well with my body chemistry. It did not last long i could not smell the top notes of sandalwood at all. So for me personally it’s not going to be signature scent.   This was collected as part of a promotion."

However, I have recently started venturing into more woody and warm scents as they smell more unique to me and seem to last longer on my skin. The Maison Louis Marie No. 4 Bois de Balincourt eau de parfum is exactly what I've been looking for in a fragrance for some time now. It smells very mature and sexy, and the notes of sandalwood and Amber wood really stand out to me. It's definitely a very warm, woody scent. My favorite thing about this fragrance is that it keeps that deep woody smell for hours after applying it and doesn't develop into something completely different as I've experienced with other fragrances with similar notes. This is my new go to perfume for nights and I can't wait to have this as my winter scent as well."

The Bois de Balincourt is the first “woodsy” fragrance that I actually really enjoy.   I feel like the spicy notes come out on top and fade very quickly into a warm sandalwood and cedarwood scent.   This blends in on my skin so I almost feel like it’s a better version of me that’s just been outdoors minus the sweat.   I like that it leans masculine but not overly so. The scent is soft and non abrasive, the only thing is I wish that it lasted a little longer.   I think this would be wonderful layered with something floral or just a hint of sweetness.   Overall this has been something I’ve been reaching for daily and I’m interested in trying more from the brand!"

It's the kind of fragrance that requires me to be in a particular mood, but when I wear it, it stands out remarkably. After eyeing it for a year, I finally have it, and it has since become a staple in my beauty routine.  Wearing this perfume evokes memories of a cozy cabin in Vermont during the crisp fall season. It blends a seductive, elegant charm with a prominent woody undertone that particularly shines in autumn and the early weeks of winter. Each time I apply it, I find myself continuously drawn to the subtle, alluring scent on my wrist. There's something for me about wearing it with a clean white cozy sweater during fall.  While there are other perfumes with similar sandalwood  profiles on the market, this one stands out as the most feminine and distinctive among them. Its unique blend of sensuality and elegance and its woody warmth make it a delightful choice for anyone seeking a memorable fragrance experience."

It is truly a work of art and I enjoy wearing it so much. It's radiates a soft, earthy and woody fragance blend. Its dominant notes are of sandalwood and cedarwood and it is purely gorgeous. It makes me feel like I'm standing in the most beautiful woods in the middle of autumn, just surrounded by sacred nature. I love that even though it is made of woody top notes, it is not an overwhelming scent at all. It is light, creamy and effuses such an amorous scent.           I also need to mention that the Maison Louis Marie brand's mission is absolutely beautiful. Its main focus is all about the creation of fragrances that blend history with a modern twist. This is the second scent I try from this brand and they truly do such an amazing job connecting memories through the art of perfumery, all while preserving their deep and respectful connection with the natural world.         The commitment this brand has to clean beauty and environmentalism and their amazing ability to create unique signature scents, has truly impressed me. I can't wait to try more of their products and see what else they are going to create for us in the coming years. "

The fragrance is formulated without phthalates, parabens, or sulfated and packaged in an understated yet elegant bottle. I loved that the product itself was colorless, very aesthetically pleasing on my fragrance shelf.  The first spritz of this Eau de Parfum shocked me. I wasn’t expecting such a bold and interesting scent to come out of such a minimalistic bottle. The top notes are Sandalwood and Vetiver which translate to a very clean smell of green, lemon, and cedarwood. It reminded me of a very nice candle, and I wasn’t sure if I liked it that at first, but this is one of those fragrances that needs to “melt” into skin before the warm cinnamon and amber scents come through.  By hour three or four I downright love it. It’s also kind of gender neutral too, if that’s something you’re looking for.  I didn’t think it was feminine or masculine, just clean, warm, and even a little sensual.  It reminds me of clean clothes and cocoa butter in the best way possible. I’d recommend pairing this with a sweet-smelling lotion and just living it up.  **This review was collected as part of a promotion**"

The cedarwood and sandalwood pair together and dance beautifully with the notes of vetiver, nutmeg, cinnamon, and amber wood so seamlessly. The longevity and scent power is so nice and this scent lasts so much longer than so many scents I’ve tried. It lasts for awhile on my skin and at least 6 hours and you can smell the layers as it fades into a more powdery scent. It’s truly such a gorgeous and complex fragrance. This reminds of my camping in the forest as a child with my family it’s super cozy and comforting. I also love that it’s unisex and my partner is a huge fan of this scent as well and keeps gravitating towards it. This would be the perfect fragrance for fall since it’s such a comfy fragrance.

The quality is amazing, from packaging/presentation to the clean ingredients. This perfume is prestige at an entry level price!  The 04 Bois de Balincourt Eau de Parfum itself was such a unique scent, unfortunately it pulled more masculine than I liked on my skin. I’m disappointed because the longevity was amazing, and the scent is strong. I don’t get much of the cinnamon or nutmeg, it dries down heavily woody on me. I do enjoy layering it with some of my sweeter, citrusy or floral scents to tone them down for a night out or during the winter. Despite the scent not matching my skin chemistry (this is definitely one of those scents you need a wear test for), I’m committed to using it because the quality and uniqueness of the perfume is great."

My favorite way to layer it was with No. 14 Icila Eau de Parfum. I loved the warm, woody, floral, and slightly sweet scent that they created when worn together. I think this is a fragrance that I could definitely wear year round. I found that this perfume had a great longevity too. I can smell it on myself all day after applying.

I went on about my day, man oh man, everyone at work was asking what perfume I had on. As the day went on, the different notes started to appear more.

As the fragrance unfolds, the rich heart of sandalwood and cedar wood takes over, weaving a tapestry of warmth and refinement. The subtle hint of the cinnamon nutmeg blend is a spicy revelation, infusing the scent with an exotic allure.  One of things I love about No.04 is its impressive sillage. A single spritz lingers beautifully in the air, leaving a trail of elegance. The longevity is exceptional; the scent clings to skin for hours and I often find myself catching whiffs of it and marveling at its complexity throughout the day.  I really enjoy treating myself to this perfume on days dedicated to self-care. After a long run under the Florida sun, I revel in a luxurious, long shower, followed by slipping into cozy pajamas. With all my favorite skincare rituals complete, a few sprays of this perfume are the perfect finishing touch. The scent transforms my relaxation time on the couch into a truly indulgent experience.  But No.04’s versatility is just one of its many charms. It transitions seamlessly from a day at work to a romantic night out, adding a touch of sophistication and allure to any occasion. Whether you're cozying up on the couch and diving into one of the great literary classics, or simply enjoying a night out, No.04 is the perfect companion.

The mist settled into my skin instantly, leaving a subtle, satiny lustre. The fragrance itself smelled strongly of cedar and cinnamon, which warned to a sweet vanilla and blue pine, with cool water notes. I also smelled pine ash, like a bonfire in distant forests with hints of sandalwood and nutmeg which were warm and earthy.   I wear this fragrance day and night, as it lasts for at least eight hours, and layers very well with other scents, especially deep florals with citrus notes. I highly recommend this fragrance for anyone who is looking for a warm, earthy, nostalgic and soothing experience."

Of all the notes in this well crafted blend of scents, sandalwood stood out the most with hints of nutmeg and pepper. One spritz gives you a light scent and lasted a few hours. Multiple spritzes give you a stronger and longer lasting scent. When I applied multiple spritzes in morning, this scent was still going strong later that afternoon! The No. 4 is also a great scent to use as a base to pair with another perfume and make a custom scent! I absolutely love the ethics of Maison Louis Marie as a brand, because they are committed to providing quality, unique products with safe and quality ingredients! So happy to add this to my collection!"

			"review_text": "I’ve been testing out the No.04 Bois de Balincourt Eau de Parfum from Maison Louis Marie and I wasn’t really feeling it at first, but it started to grow on me. The fragrance opens with a beautiful musky mix of sandalwood and cedarwood, creating a warm and earthy scent that feels both luxurious and comforting. As it dries down, there’s a subtle sweetness that adds depth without overpowering the woodsy notes.  I could tell that this scent is very suitable for Autumn, where the weather is about to change to chilly. It’s sophisticated enough for special occasions, yet subtle enough for daily wear, not to mention it’s unisex. I find that it lingers nicely on the skin. The longevity is impressive, lasting through my busy day without needing a touch-up. It’s also nice as a base layer for other sweet warm perfumes.  The packaging is elegant and minimalist, which I appreciate. The cap though, could be improved to be more secure. This is a scent that feels both timeless and modern, making it a wild card addition to any perfume collection."

The projection is great and it lasts a good while on my skin. I’m absolutely obsessed! Another thing to note is my partner doesn’t usually like woody fragrances, but he adores this! I would wear this all year long, but it’s perfect for Fall/Winter. It’s just so comforting. I 1000% recommend this to anyone and everyone!"

My first impression of the Maison Louis Marie No.04 was the elegant packaging that it arrived in. This scent was woody and earthy, as advertised, but it also had hints of floral scents. Personally, I liked this scent best when layering over a floral scent, as it brought out more of the floral notes. In my opinion, this scent will layer well over just about any floral scent of your choosing. This scent was nostalgic and brought back memories of younger years and it reminded me of a scent that you’d smell walking into Hollister. For me, the only thing I did not like about Maison Louis Marie No.04 was that the scent didn’t seem to last very long."

It stands out not just because of the alluring, mysterious scent, but also because it has a romantic, almost secretive nature to it. It's discrete and wears close to the skin. Something you have to be close to smell. I love that about it- it's giving signature scent!! That also makes it a wonderful scent for layering. I can spray a few times on my skin before getting dressed, and then use a different fragrance over my clothes and I have a dynamic scent that lasts all day. I prefer woodsy, unisex scents to sweet scents, so that's what initially piqued my interest in No.4. It's warm and inviting, yet fresh and green. It's great in the summer, and I think it will transition well in to fall too!"

			"review_text": "Maison Louis Marie’s Bois de Balincourt fragrance is a captivating blend of sensuality and sophistication, wrapped in a clean, fresh allure. From the first spritz, you are immediately greeted by the unmistakable aroma of cedarwood. This note is both grounding and uplifting, evoking images of towering trees and the rich, earthy scent of a forest floor. As Bois settles on the skin, the heart of the fragrance begins to reveal itself. Nutmeg, with its spicy and slightly sweet profile, adds a layer of intrigue and depth and I feel that the spice note is perfectly balanced and once the fragrance continues to evolve, amber emerges as a key player, adding a rich, resinous quality that enhances the overall warmth of the scent. One of the most enchanting aspects of Bois de Balincourt is its dry down. As the hours pass, the fragrance fades into a beautiful accord of woods and warmth. The cedarwood, nutmeg, and amber notes meld together seamlessly, creating a scent that is both enduring and evolving. This transformation is subtle yet noticeable, allowing you to enjoy different facets of the fragrance throughout the day. No4's ability to linger delicately on the skin while maintaining a beautiful evolution throughout the day is a testament to its quality and artistry."

This fragrance reminds me of the smell of trees after it rains…the wet leaves and fresh earthy scent in the air.

I applied one spray each behind my ears in the creases of my elbows. That was definitely enough to smell a strong combination of sandalwood and cedarwood. About an hour later, the woody scents started to settle in and I noticed the scent of vetiver emerging. A few hours after that, the amber wood overtook the vetiver.

The name of Maison Louis Marie’s #4 comes from the founder's family home, Balincourt, which is surrounded by a forest a trail called Lover's Lane. Very French and romantic. As is the scent. The tradition of this company of using exquisite botanicals with no chemicals or toxins as many perfumes have makes all the difference in how it the scent is perceived by your nose. And others. It’s a delicate balance they have mastered.  This is a very woodsy earthy scent which I normally like to wear during the fall and winter months. They feel too heavy for me especially in the triple digit heat we’re having here in Las Vegas.  But this was lovely. I think the vétiver, which is earthy but can have an astringent quality is the key. There’s nothing heavy, overbearing, or too warm about this scent at all. I will wear this scent all year round.

I was very excited to try the No. 04 Bois de Balincourt given its woody notes. I also really like that Mason Louis Marie is a clean brand that also gives back to the planet.  I first want to say that the packaging was very simplistic yet alluring. I loved that it had the notes written on the outer box. When I sprayed it, I initially felt like the top notes were too harsh and almost very masculine. I did not like the initial notes that I experienced. After the fragrance settled, it evolved into this warm and earthy smell. Like I was a forest, surrounded by gardens and woods. This, I was in love it. I also used it to layer it with a vanilla scented perfume and the outcome was electrifying.   When I first started using the scent, I did not like the top notes. However, with time, I got used to it and it didn’t bother me as much. I liked that I could layer it with different fragrances which produced good outcomes.

It’s a lighter scent than I expected from the listed notes (cedar and sandalwood and spice), though it lasts fairly well on my skin. This is a fresh unisex scent that I could imagine working for anyone. It seems best-suited to spring and summer, but it could be worn year-round, especially if layered with a warmer scent.   The simplicity of the bottle only adds to the appeal: the clean lines echo the clean scent and clean ingredients. Monochrome labeling and the pared-down aesthetic show that sometimes simplicity is best."

I can imagine both a woman or a man wearing this scent. Upon first spray, this perfume has a heavy hit of sandalwood mixed with other spicy notes. I will say that the opening wasn’t my favorite, but as it settled into my skin, the perfume became addicting. It settled into a soft musky smell, and I couldn’t stop smelling my wrist all day. I’ll admit that you have to have a woody scent profile, or it may be too overwhelming.

This perfume, No.04 Bois de Balincourt Eau de Parfum, has a powerful earthy profile with woodsy notes like sandalwood, amber, cedarwood, and nutmeg. At first, I was a little startled by how earthy the scent profile was upon spraying it for the first time, but I quickly grew to love it as the dried-down scent is almost musky and it reminds me of being in a forest. This isn't a floral garden nature scent, this is a true you're hiking in a remote and ancient forest woodsy scent. This scent is truly unisex, but if you're not used to earthy scent profiles, you may feel like it leans more masculine. I like to vary my perfumes so I enjoy this aspect and because it's a layering scent, I can play up the masculine or feminine elements with other perfumes layered on top. I've really enjoyed adding some sweeter floral/vanilla perfumes on top and it's created a really unique scent profile. My husband and I both wore this out and enjoyed the long-lasting scent and how well it projects. I highly recommend this for my woodsy scent lovers and appreciate how Maison Louis Marie captures timeless and nostalgic scents in beautiful packaging."

			"review_text": "This brand is considered a clean luxury fragrance line. I love the brand’s philosophy; they do not use harmful ingredients for the environment nor for the body. From the packaging to the bottle, it’s such a luxurious product. The scent is woody with hints of florals. This brand says that their fragrances are unisex, and I would agree, although in my opinion, this scent leans a little more on the masculine side to me. I like that this scent isn’t too strong which is a plus for me since I’m more of a fan of mellow scents. Even though this scent isn’t too strong, it does fade throughout the day but I honestly don’t mind. The instruction recommends spraying on areas where there isn’t friction/rubbing (knees/elbows) so that the fragrance last longer. "

Two of my favorite notes, sandalwood and amber wood, are in this fragrance, which explains why I love it so much. It has a woody and earthy scent that is sophisticated, cozy, and beautiful. My first impression was that it felt unique and somewhat soothing.  It layers beautifully with other fragrances, and the packaging is stunning—minimalistic yet elegant.  I was also impressed by its lasting power; it lasted for many hours without needing to reapply.   The first time I wore it was for a family gathering, and I received so many compliments! Since then, I’ve been wearing it every day, and it exceeds my expectations every time.  My final thought is that it is a must-try fragrance that provides a luxurious experience."

It feels like Maison Louis Marie No. 4 was created for me, but specifically the fiery Aries part of me that owns an abundance of combat boots and sundresses. No.04 Bois de Balincourt really helps me feel the balance between my masculine and feminine energies, which I think represents my personality and sense of style thoroughly. I have always told people my favorite scent is “sun warmed evergreen trees”. It puts me completely at peace and takes me back to the best parts of my childhood. No.4 brings me that kind of nostalgia with the combination of cedar wood and sandalwood.  The warm spices are just enough to bring me confidence and vetiver just speaks to my soul.  The combination reminds me a bit of ozone, in a sweet and earthy tone. I don’t think it’s a coincidence the notes of this scent come from a group of plants that’s are spiritually affiliated with grounding, peace, and happiness. This little hedge witch will be wearing Maison Louis Marie No.4 until further notice."

The earthy almost grounded scent profile is very welcoming and reminded me of warm summer rain in my hometown. I tried layering the Bois de Balincourt with a light crisp floral fragrance. This for me felt like I was inhaling summer. It almost felt like smelling the earthy woody plant and light crisp flowers together and was very enjoyable. While I really enjoyed the scent by itself and layered, the fragrance is a little mild and did not last very long for me. When layered, it was overpowered by the scent of the floral fragrance which lingered longer. Saying that the scent profile of the Bois de Balincourt was well worth the respritzing for me. I would wear this fragrance during the summer as a day time perfume."

The Maison Louis Marie No.4 Bois de Balincourt is a perfect scent for me: warm, woodsy, and a tad earthy. The cedarwood is prominent as the top note then as it dries down, it lightly sweetens to Amber wood.   The best part of the final dry down stage is that this fragrance smells very clean on me. Unfortunately, the fragrance didn't last very long on my skin   I sprayed this on my partner before going outside on a hot day. It smelled so different on him. The Sandalwood was more prominent as the top note, I could smell the cinnamon and nutmeg on him opposed to how it wore on me and it became really sweet on him; I liked it.   The fragrance wore longer on him than it did on me, so I layered mine with other fragrances."

It’s very fresh but with a hint of spicyness, this perfume is perfect for any men or for a woman that enjoy this type of fragrances, I’ll wait until fall - winter because it will be a great match to wear it when the weather gets down.  The bottle and the mist I’ll say is just ok nothing impressive, the cap is a bit loose not sure if my bottle came defective or that’s the way they are. In conclusion is a good fragrance? Yes, not a good sillage, is a bit pricey for what you get and it’s definitely more masculine."

Fragrance Notes: Top Notes: Sandalwood, Cedarwood Mid Notes: Vetiver, Nutmeg, Cinnamon Base Notes: Amber Wood  The first spritz hits me with a warm, woody embrace of sandalwood and cedarwood. It’s like stepping into a cozy cabin surrounded by towering trees. As it settles, the spicy hints of nutmeg and cinnamon start to dance around, adding a touch of warmth and intrigue. Finally, the earthy vetiver and rich amber wood linger, creating a scent that’s both grounding and luxurious.   What It Reminds Me Of: This fragrance takes me back to a magical trail called “Lover’s Lane” near my childhood home. Imagine walking hand-in-hand with someone special, the air filled with the scent of the forest, leaves crunching underfoot, and the sun casting a golden glow through the trees. It’s nostalgic and romantic, like a cherished memory bottled up.  The last time I wore Bois de Balincourt was on a crisp evening. I was out for a dinner date, and as soon as I walked into the restaurant, I got compliments on how amazing I smelled. It made me feel confident and a bit mysterious, like I had a secret woodland escape that only I knew about.

Those two combined make a sexy woodsy spicy scent that makes me want to hug myself!! I love this fragrance now in July, but would prefer to let it shine the most in the cooler months.

I like that it is not overpowering. It smells so great all day and I get compliments from people on what I wear. It has a woody and earthy scent which is great for Summer. This is my favorite scent of this brand. I spray 2 pumps and it lasts so long. It can be worn day and night. The packaging is simple, yet elegant and luxurious. I love the design of this perfume. I highly recommend this perfume to anyone who loves the natural scent. I love that it is a vegan perfume which is great for my sensitive skin. My skin sometimes gets sensitive because of harsh ingredients, but this perfume has no issue."

I also love how much the brand cares about the environment and has initiatives to give back. The top was a little loose, but that might have been due to transport. As for the scent, it’s a very woodsy and romantic scent. I feel like this is unisex and can be worn by anyone! I enjoy scents like that a lot because I feel like it requires a more complex scent profile. The Cedarwood, sandalwood, and nutmeg really come through! There’s also cinnamon and Amber as well which really just adds so much to it. I’ve been applying this to my pulse points and enjoy the perfume very much. The only downside is that it doesn’t last as long as I thought it would. However, if you layer it with the perfume oil or another perfume oil, then the scent lasts longer."

			"review_text": "Over the past week and a half, I have had the opportunity to use Maison Louis Marie No.04 Bois de Balincourt Eau de Parfum extensively. Initially, I was intrigued by its description as a unisex scent, promising a blend of light yet potent notes. However, my experience turned out to be quite different. The fragrance, while undeniably light, carried an overpowering presence of cedar and sandalwood. These woodsy notes dominated the scent profile, making it lean heavily towards a more traditionally masculine aroma rather than a balanced unisex one.  I made several attempts to integrate this perfume into my routine, experimenting with spraying it on different parts of my body to see if the scent would mellow out or blend differently with my skin. Despite these efforts, the persistent woodsy aroma was too overwhelming for my liking. In fact, it was so potent that it led to headaches on more than one occasion, which made wearing it an uncomfortable experience.  Reflecting on this, I would rate my experience with Maison Louis Marie No.04 Bois de Balincourt Eau de Parfum as a 1 out of 5. This rating is primarily due to the overpowering nature of the cedar and sandalwood notes, which overshadowed any other potential nuances in the fragrance. However, I recognize that scent preferences are highly subjective. If you are someone who enjoys the robust, earthy combination of sandalwood and cedar, this perfume might be exactly what you're looking for. Unfortunately, it just wasn't the right fit for me."

I was excited to try this sandalwood fragrance because I have experience appreciating the subtleties of high-end perfumes as a beauty lover and product critic. I'm happy to have added Maison Louis Marie No.04 Bois de Balincourt to my collection of fragrances. The refined scent of its sandalwood foundation, enhanced by cedarwood, cinnamon, nutmeg, and vetiver, ages gracefully throughout the day. I found that the aroma stayed present for several hours after using it as directed, which was 1-2 sprays on pulse points. My favorite scent for both daytime and evening wear is now this one. This scent is a really captivating sensory experience. I was welcomed by a warm, woodsy scent—dominated by cedarwood and sandalwood—that made me feel sophisticated and at ease upon first spritz. While earthy vetiver grounded the scent, spicy overtones of cinnamon and nutmeg offered a delicate richness. The perfume took me on a pleasant journey as it developed on my skin, beginning with strong woods and spices and ending with a harmonic blend that remained for a very long time.  It would appeal to both men and women who like unisex perfumes because of its well-balanced composition."

			"review_text": "This fragrance is so good. It is so simple yet so complex and sophisticated.  Now, if you don't like woody or earthy fragrances, this is not for you. It really smells like spending time outside amongst the tree and nature.  For my nose, the cedarwood is super dominant at first. As that goes away, vetiver, cinnamon, and nutmeg really come through along with a woody amber. I can sometimes smell a sweetness from the cinnamon mixed with the amber come through.  This is a really lovely genderless fragrance that I think will work on almost anyone. It's also a fragrance you can layer with other ones!  My only feedback is that the cap is very loose. There is no snap when I go to put the cap on and comes off way too easily."

Known for their environmentally friendly practices and ethical standards, Maison Louis Marie has consistently delivered products that not only smell wonderful but also respect our planet.  The No.04 Bois de Balincourt stands out with its strong sandalwood base, enhanced by a robust cedarwood presence. This woody foundation is intricately laced with a spicy blend of cinnamon and nutmeg, adding a warmth that is both comforting and sophisticated. An undercurrent of earthy vetiver adds depth, making the fragrance rich and enveloping.  Despite the high quality and complexity of the scent, it turns out that sandalwood is not quite my cup of tea. There is a particular quality to this fragrance that does not resonate well with my olfactory senses. This personal preference means I won’t be keeping this perfume for myself.  Although the No.04 Bois de Balincourt Eau de Parfum from Maison Louis Marie is not a match for me, its craftsmanship and the brand's ethical approach to fragrance production are beyond reproach. I appreciate the brand's dedication to not using ingredients that are harmful to the environment or the body, their stance against animal testing, and their avoidance of animal-derived components. This perfume will surely delight someone who favors woody, spicy scents, and I am pleased to pass it on to a friend who adores this fragrance profile. Maison Louis Marie continues to uphold the standards of luxury and responsibility, making them a commendable choice for fragrance enthusiasts."

			"review_text": "I am a 34 year old beauty enthusiast and I especially love the world of fragrance! Having tried and loved another Maison Louis Marie perfume, I was excited to try Bois de Balincourt. Upon first spray however, I discovered this scent was not for me personally. Scent is a very subjective and personal thing and body chemistries vary from person to person and can drastically alter scent profiles, so take this review with a grain of salt.  I have several perfumes I love that contain similar woody notes to No.4, but this one smells completely different. To me, this perfume exudes a spicy and peppery note that is reminiscent of that “old man cologne” smell. While it’s touted as a unisex scent, I feel like it’s very masculine and has no femininity to it whatsoever. Also, this feels like it would be more appropriate to wear in the fall and winter than in the warmer months.  A positive to note is that if you do enjoy this scent, the longevity is next level, it lasts all day long and projects extremely well. While I don’t love this scent, the brand behind the scent is incredible and I encourage you to do some research on them.  If you want to try out this brand or want a more feminine scent, I highly recommend testing out No.14 Icila. It’s a dark vanilla plum that is delicious and garners so many compliments!"

			"review_text": "Usually, I reserve any spicy woody scents for the fall/winter season. I love this scent family to be layered with gourmand or other spicy scents. This is the first time I've experienced a perfect wood scent for summer. The initial whiff you are met with pure greenery as it evolves the fresher it becomes; citrus transforms into a warm amber scentsation. Even though citrus notes are not listed, I can swear I recognize a lemon note in there, providing this scent with great balance. The cinnamon note is also another great addition; providing that summer zing. This fragrance can be adapted to anyone, perfectly genderless.  I don't usually gravitate to vetiver but this is a great introduction to ease my fellow gourmand enthusiasts. I recommend layering it with NEST's Golden Nectar and Madagascar Vanilla if you want to skew warmer. If you wish to bloom brighter I recommend layering it with Malin + Goetz's Bergamot or Maison Louis Marie No.14 Icila Perfume Oil."

For me, the draw is both the top notes and its lingering heart. No. 4 opens with a crisp, bright freshness that is light, but grounded in a weightless woodiness. It reminds me of the cleanness after a fresh rain in an open forest. As the fragrance settles, it draws you in even closer with a lasting cinnamon rapture. From heart to base notes, No. 4 has a warmth that deepens from nutmeg, vetiver, and amber wood. This is a lovely fragrance that is a mix of everything— bright, fresh, warm, spicy, a little earthy, a little musky. And surprisingly, it all comes together in a perfect balance. It’s a versatile scent that could easily be worn by any gender as it has hints of both a perfume and cologne— let your skin chemistry work its magic! No. 4 hugs close to the skin, making it workplace friendly while imprinting a lasting scent profile on your skin. Do note that spraying less is more with this one— to keep the balance of being grounded and light, without ever being too heavy. In addition to the fragrance, I also love its overall presentation. The clean, simple, elegant aesthetic mirrors the clean profile of its ingredients. MLM No. 4 Bois de Balincourt EDP is an excellent choice for those who appreciate a unique, versatile, alluring scent. (This review was collected as part of a promotion)."

I can confirm it is very woody and has a musky scent to it so if this is something you are into, I think you’ll love this perfume! I think it can be layered as well. For a more feminine smell I suggest going floral and for a more masculine smell I suggest going with something citrus or tobacco.

My husband didn’t like the scent when I sprayed it on him, but on me he said it smelled pretty nice and not overbearing. I have also received a few compliments when I wore this out and people were wondering what it was.  When wearing this fragrance, I feel sophisticated, mysterious yet also casual and ready to take on the day. The only downfall for me is that it does not have the longest lasting power. I feel like by the time I get home, I don’t smell it. I may need to try the oil to see if the scent lasts longer because I do really like it.

The story of the company is just as lovely and fresh as their fragrances.  It’s hard to want to purchase a scent online and the packaging is very minimal but No. 4 to me will be my number one favorite.

Once the dry down comes along, I find it to be such a gentle and powdery skin scent. This fragrance is a great option for unisex perfume. I don't find that it leans too feminine or masculine. The perfume bottle itself is beautiful and minimalistic and the sleek bottle looks wonderful on my vanity. The spray nozzle is also quite nice; it gives a fine mist that helps me cover a better portion of my neck. As for longevity, this perfume lasts on my skin for 5 to 6 hours.

I feel like I am finally getting to enjoy perfumes again because when I was pregnant or nursing perfumes seemed way too strong for me and would give me a headache. The scent from this MAISON LOUIS MARIENo.04 Bois de Balincourt Eau de Parfum seems very neutral to me as far as not being too feminine or too masculine. It is not overpowering or too strong and last long enough for me. I love the simple packaging from this company because I think it gives it a more of a upscale look and they really care about the environment. Would definitely recommend this scent and this company.   **This review was collected as part of a promotion."

I loved the scent of the fragrance as its right up my ally. The classic luxurious bottle looks great on my shelf. I even contemplating keeping the box because it just looks so simplistic and elegant in the white box. I find that this is one of those scents on me that lasts that I can smell on my wrist hours later. There's one thing I don't like is a fragrance that just disappears into skin or clothes. I usually am not much of a fan of a straight woodsy scent, but the blend of the Amber is the perfect complement and goes well with my body chemistry. I also like that this is described as a layerable fragrance. Overall, I would recommend this fragrance and give it five out of five stars.   *For External Review Submission please indicate on your review that This review was collected as part of a promotion"

The sandalwood and cedarwood notes create a beautiful foundation that's both rugged and cozy. As the fragrance develops, the spicy cinnamon and nutmeg complex emerges, adding depth and intrigue without overpowering the woods.  What I love most about this scent is its versatility. It's truly unisex, appealing to anyone who appreciates a sophisticated woody fragrance. The amber in the base adds a subtle warmth that complements the fresh, crisp elements beautifully. It's like wrapping yourself in a soft, luxurious blanket while walking through a sun-dappled forest.  The longevity is impressive, lasting 7-8 hours on my skin with moderate sillage. I've received numerous compliments, which speaks volumes about its allure. Whether I'm heading to the office or out for a casual evening, Bois de Balincourt always feels appropriate and elevates my mood.  If you're looking for a unique, high-quality woody fragrance that stands out from the crowd, I can't recommend No.04 Bois de Balincourt enough."

I'm one of those folks who detects the scent of dill in the first note—not pickles, but the real herb. It doesn't stay long and isn't unsettling. As it dries down, the perfume transforms into one that is more feminine and powdery. It's definitely one of those smells that trick you at first. I would feel at ease wearing it to work because the perfume isn't overbearing or powerful.  It smells a little powerful and manly at first, but as it settles and melds with the chemistry of the skin, it becomes a really clean, delicate, woodsy, and even slightly floral scent. The lasting was a little short, in my opinion.   This review was collected as part of a promotion"

The brand story is extremely intriguing between the family owned business and the heavy focus on having clean products. You can tell how much every person within this brand cares about and believes in their products. The perfume bottle itself is gorgeous, along with the packaging. It reflects the clean ingredients by being very minimalistic while still providing enough information on the perfume. The perfume smells great from the initial spray. The entire wear time it is heavily woodsy with the cedar being the main note I can smell. It wore really well throughout the day, probably about 5-7 hours of wear. The scent definitely tones down a bit after an hour or so, but I actually prefer it toned down a bit so you can get the spice scents coming through as well. The protection is moderate and the sillage seemed pretty low to me. I think this perfume would work extremely well for layering, especially with a vanilla scent!"

I love anything fruity, floral, musky but usually very open to a broad spectrum of fragrances as well! I’ve had the pleasure of trying the No. 14 from the  MLM brand and loved it so much so I was excited to be able to get my hands on the No. 4 because I’ve read so many positive reviews. The Bois De Balincourt EDP is definitely on the earthy, woodsy side. It’s very heavy on the sandalwood aspect and similar to Santal 33 if you like that scent! It’s a great dupe for that so I’ve heard. For me, it’s a bit too strong - but it could be that it didn’t mix well with my body chemistry. I’m also sensitive to certain fragrances and this made me feel kind of nauseous unfortunately. The good thing about it is that it lasts forever on the skin! Same with the No. 14, so the longevity is great for those who end up loving this scent! I can see this being really nice in the colder months on a night out. I wish I loved it more than I do but it didn’t mesh too well with me personally and slightly too strong for my nose."

I needed to try another, Maison Louis Marie No. 4 Bois de Balincourt. This is a beautiful scent. All the notes come together amazingly. It is very woodsy and musky yet, with a touch of spicy sweetness. It really does remind me of being out roaming and having adventures in the woods. It is masculine yet feminine making it perfect for everyone. With that all being said I unfortunately can’t seem to wear it too long without my allergies acting up. As much as I adore the scent it pains me to say that because I truly love it! It seems to be the Cedar wood that is a little too over powering for me. I have used many products with cedar wood but I’ve never seemed to have a reaction to it. Again the scents tie together beautifully. If you love woodsy/ musky scents then Bois de Balincourt is something to look into!"

It takes about an hour for the top notes to start to fade away and then the perfume becomes a little less in your face. It smells better after an hour in my opinion but it smells even better mixed. I desperately wanted to love this perfume on it's own, but mixed with Kayali Vanilla 28 just brings it to a whole other level. I already love Vanilla 28 but adding No.04 just brings out another side to it and they pair so we'll together. I really love wearing them both together. Alone and together the perfume lasts all day and I love how minimalistic but still luxurious the glass bottle packaging is. Even though I'm not head over heels in love with it on it's own, I really love how it pairs with other scents, and it still has so many great aspects to it that I had to give it 4 stars."

Vetiver is the only verdant element in the parfum, contributing a fresh, earthy, balancing note to the overall formulation. While it may read as masculine dominant parfum, No. 04 truly is universal in that it evokes a setting and scent experience that is real, enjoyed by most human beings at some point. It is a sensorial recreation of a place with its natural elements, rather than a curated mixology with a human profile at its center. When I wear this scent, I feel transported to the intended setting – a forest in France – which is itself neither feminine nor masculine but simply a rich, natural landscape perfuming the earth. As such, its naturalistic and calming beauty wears well on all. The intensity and sillage of this parfum is not overtaking – I would describe it as intentional and deep but tranquil, enveloping and soothing like its fragrance source: forest trees. I experimented layering Icila perfume oil over Bois de Balincourt, anticipating either a clash or cancelation of scents given Icila is as profoundly floral as Bois is woodsy, and was surprised at how well they played with each other. I may not wear the combination every day, however it’s nice to have the option of layering with MLM. Really loving the standout fragrance formulations of this brand overall and Bois de Balincourt is no exception."

Now, all of that said it is time to talk about the scent in question. No.04 Bois de Balincourt. I didn't like it, on me. But, how could that be when I just gave such glowing testimony to this company? Chemistry happens. I have loved scents all of my life and at forty-five years old that is a long time. Scents create and hold our memories safe. They capture precious moments and remind us of them years later. They are all encapsulating of our daily lives and sometimes a scent simply does not work for us.  This is so true for this scent. I love how it smells in the bottle. In a room. On my husband. It is deep, woodsy, and a little spicy like taking a walk in the woods in the fall. Things are a little damp the leaves underfoot create a subtle musk of their own. It's beautiful. On my husband it is intoxicating. On me, not so much. I couldn't smell anything on me besides a strange powdery scent that was unappealing and that is simply because my body chemistry does not work with the scent. I will continue to support the company, love other scents they have, and remind myself and the reader that not all scents work for us and that is okay because scent was never a one-sniff-fits-all category.

The packaging looks so clean and simple but the glass bottle shows how chic the fragrance truly is. The scent is warm, rich, powerful and definitely smells woodsy. The scent seems a bit strong at first but it does settle down after a few minutes of wearing it. I kept getting whiffs of the fragrance throughout the whole day, I love how it sticks with you! I appreciate the fact it’s a gender less fragrance, not a lot of brands sell gender less products. Although to me it does seem more of something I’d purchase for my fiancé rather than myself..BUT the more I use it the more I like it for myself! This will definitely be a fall staple scent for me, try layering it with a vanilla scent..trust me you’ll be happy you did. Obsessed!"

It’s very light and in fact the lightest warm blend I’ve ever experienced.  What I love the most is that as the day goes on it wears down to a bit of cinnamon on the back note and my absolute favorite vetiver, makes its presence known.  No 4 just keeps changing and morphing into a beautiful mystery that you can’t help but keep smelling throughout the day and into the night. It’s easily layered with other fragrances without getting lost or fighting them. It’s easy worn during the day and I’ve found it to be light enough to become my daily go to for work, without worrying about disturbing those who may be sensitive to certain smells. The bottle is simple, understated and elegant. It’s a beautiful addition to any shelf or collection. I can’t ignore the fact that it’s also Paraben free and vegan."

			"review_text": "I have been a lover of Maison Louis Marie fragrance for quite some time, but I have tended to stay away from anything described as “woody & earthy” because I typically find those fragrances too masculine for me. If that is you, please let me assure you this one is not too masculine! This is the most light woody fragrance I have ever smelled. The sandalwood, vetiver, and nutmeg stick out most to me and remind me of a light breeze in the countryside, reading a book under big old trees. I absolutely LOVE this scent! A little tip for you if you have any of the Maison Louis Marie perfume oils, is to first apply your perfume oil and then layer with this Eau de Parfum of no. 04 Bois de Balincourt to create a combination with even more depth and longevity! I do think this Eau de Parfum has a nice longevity, and a medium amount of sillage. It isn’t completely personal, but it doesn’t throw to the whole room either. You will have a trail behind you for a little mystery and romance. My favorite perfume oil to mix this with is no. 13, Nouvelle  Vague. It gives the perfect balance of floral & woody! Sheer perfection! You have to try this at least once!"

I love how this company donates 1% of revenue to the National Forest Foundation.  I was excited to try this one as I love the No. 14.   This parfum is a very unique, gender neutral earthy scent that can be layered.  For me, it is a much stronger scent and a little goes a long way, I can definitely smell the herbal fragrance and it smells a lot like the woods and Thyme.  I made sure my skin was well moisturized before spaying a very small amount and it lasted all day.   I did not get any compliments while wearing, not one of my favorites of Maison Louis Marie.  I would definitely recommend trying in store before buying."

			"review_text": "The Maison Louis Marie No. 4 is a captivating fragrance that immediately envelops your senses with its extraordinary scent. Imagine yourself in a lush forest, the air thick with the intoxicating aroma of ancient woods. This perfume, rich with woody notes, opens with a powerful blend of sandalwood and cedarwood that command attention without overwhelming.  When first applied, the top notes of sandalwood and cedarwood are unmistakably robust, yet they gracefully avoid being too intense. This fragrance is best experienced when sprayed directly onto the skin, allowing its full complexity to unfold. If you're not fond of woody scents, the initial intensity might feel a bit bold. However, as the perfume settles, the top notes seamlessly merge with the mid notes of nutmeg and cinnamon, adding a warm, spicy layer that enhances the overall aroma.  The base note of amberwood slowly emerges as the fragrance mellows over time. After a few hours, what lingers is a divine, warm amber scent that feels both comforting and luxurious. This scent is decidedly warm and woody, creating an enveloping aura that is incredibly inviting.  Maison Louis Marie No. 4 is a special fragrance, distinct from the typical fruity or floral perfumes. Its subtlety lies in its perfect blend of spicy and woody notes, offering a unique olfactory experience. When first sprayed, you are greeted with a burst of spicy warmth, which gradually softens into a warm amber embrace that is nothing short of divine.   This fragrance isn't your everyday scent; it's designed for those who appreciate the depth and richness of woody notes. Its gender-neutral appeal makes it perfect for both men and women. The blend is harmonious, never too strong, always subtle, and infinitely inviting.   Maison Louis Marie No. 4 is ideal for evening wear or special occasions. It demands a mood that matches its elegance and warmth, making it perfect for date nights or sophisticated gatherings."

This has top notes of sandalwood and cedarwood, middle notes of vetiver, nutmeg, and cinnamon, and base notes of amber wood. I honestly did not care for this fragrance because it is said to be unisex but I thought it was more on the masculine side, it has a very strong woody scent that was a bit overwhelming, it reminded me of an old man cologne. This did have a lot of lasting power but I didn't smell any sandalwood, or amber I actually couldn't tell it had cinnamon or nutmeg either.

It conjures images of pine trees blowing in cool breeze making soft, soothing swishing sounds.

I don’t have to worry about it matching with items around my room or in the bathroom, because the box is white and the bottle itself is clear.   Theme: When spraying Bois De Balincourt, I am instantly transported to the woods. It gives me cozy vibes like I am by a campfire. In my opinion, I do like the fragrance but it gives me more fall-time wear. I am mentioning this because of the middle notes of nutmeg and cinnamon. With the two notes, I am instantly transported to autumn time.   Scent: The Bois De Balincourt is perfect for a person who doesn't like sweet scents. The notes in the perfume are all wood, which means they're more on the warm, earthy side. I noticed there is one floral note, but it goes perfectly with the wood notes because it is on the dry grass mixed with the citrus side.  Wear time: I always spray my perfume on my wrists, since it stays the longest on me. I am a person who doesn't spray a lot only two to three times. When timing myself, the longest number 4 last on me is about Five to six hours without respraying. Bios De Balincourt, I noticed is a little bit stronger than their No.14, making it last longer, if you're a person that doesn't like to keep respraying."

			"review_text": "*this review was collected as part of a promotion* I recently picked up Maison Louis Marie No.04 Bois de Balincourt, and it's quickly become a staple in my fragrance collection. First off, the packaging is totally Instagram-worthy – sleek, minimalist, and elegant. It looks great on my vanity and fits right in with a modern, clean aesthetic.  Now, onto the scent itself. The first spritz hits you with a warm, woody aroma, thanks to the sandalwood and cedarwood notes. There's a subtle hint of spice from the vetiver and nutmeg that adds a bit of complexity without being overpowering. It’s earthy and grounding, making it perfect for both everyday wear and more special occasions.  One thing to note, though, is the price. It’s definitely a splurge, but I think it's worth it for the quality and the unique scent profile. The fragrance lasts a decent amount of time, around 6-7 hours on my skin, which is pretty solid.  Overall, if you’re into woody, sophisticated scents and don’t mind spending a bit more for a high-quality fragrance, Maison Louis Marie No.04 Bois de Balincourt is definitely worth checking out. It’s a chic, modern scent that’s both comforting and elegant."

I like to wear it during the day time and to the office.  It’s a great subtle scent that also lasts all day.  I recommend giving this a try if you like woody scents!"

The delightful blend of cinnamon, sandalwood, vetiver, and amber wood creates a scent that is perfect on its own. This versatile fragrance is ideal for both work and leisure, making it suitable for everyday wear, seasonal use, or special occasions.  I am 34 years old, living in Michigan for the past year and originally from Australia. I’m a beauty and fragrance enthusiast! For me, this fragrance evokes cherished memories of working back home in Australia, nestled in the mountains at a resort. The woodland and rainforest scents would waft through the mountains from the different forest biomes, creating an enchanting atmosphere that I still hold dear. It’s incredible how a scent can transport me back to those times, capturing moments that feel like personal treasures.  I appreciate fragrances that not only smell wonderful but also evoke a sense of nostalgia and connection to the past. This scent does just that, making it a staple in my collection. Whether I’m wearing it for a busy day at work or a relaxing evening at home, it consistently brings a sense of calm and joy. For any fellow fragrance enthusiasts, I highly recommend giving this one a try.  This review was collected as part of a promotion, but the sentiments expressed are genuinely my own. This fragrance has truly made a lasting impression on me, and I believe it will do the same for others who give it a try."

			"review_text": "Maison Louis Marie's No.04 Bois de Balincourt Eau de Parfum is a sophisticated and concentrated fragrance that masterfully blends botanical tradition with modern sensibilities. With a dominant accord of cedarwood and sandalwood, complemented by a spicy cinnamon nutmeg complex and earthy vetiver notes, this scent is reminiscent of a deeper, more intense version of Le Labo's Santal 33. The richness of its composition means that just a small amount goes a long way, enveloping you in its aroma for hours.  One of the intriguing aspects of No.04 Bois de Balincourt is its polarizing nature. While many appreciate its woodsy, earthy tones, others detect a unique, pickle-like scent that can be off-putting. This makes it a perfect choice for those who prefer fragrances that steer clear of sweet, floral, or gourmand notes.  Maison Louis Marie's commitment to clean, luxurious fragrances that are phthalate-, paraben-, sulfate-, and cruelty-free is commendable. Their dedication to sustainable and ethical practices, avoiding harmful ingredients and animal testing, aligns with the growing demand for eco-conscious beauty products.  In conclusion, while No.04 Bois de Balincourt may not be everyone's cup of tea, its intricate blend and the brand's admirable values make it a noteworthy addition to any fragrance collection. Although I remain indifferent to the scent itself, I wholeheartedly support what Maison Louis Marie represents in the world of perfumery."

I went as far as concocting my own scents and found a French lady that would also make her own. Those are till now the only scents I use on myself. I LOVE the scent of wood & leather, so having this product in my hand is dangerous! (hahaha) I am so in love with the scent, first of all Sandalwood is top for me, and vetiver! I mean, its LUX in one bottle!! And that's really what this brand promised to give you Luxury and they sure delivered. From the packaging to the high quality of the scent! I love that they put the structure of the scent on the box. I'm an alchemist so I understand the TOP MID BASE aspect of it. And it last!! oh my does it last, I've been misting myself once during the day, and hours later I can still smell the base of the product! It's become truly one of my favorites. My partner was saying its only for Woman, I sprayed a bit on him, and true to its notes, it had such a beautiful masculine scent on his skin!

You can wear this year-round, not just in fall. This is also a gender-neutral scent and my husband likes it as well. The quality and lasting power is impressive. One spray and I can still smell it on my wrist hours later. It’s a great scent for day or night.  Also, the bottle is so pretty on my vanity. I love the modern shape and the minimalist design. It was hard to not keep the box because even that design was so well thought out!

This scent is like stepping into a tranquil forest, capturing nature’s essence in the most beautiful way.  Maison Louis Marie has a long history of crafting delicate, nature-inspired scents since 1792, and No.04 Bois de Balincourt is a perfect example of their expertise. This fragrance has a rich sandalwood base, complemented by cedarwood and sandalwood notes. There’s also a spicy touch of cinnamon and nutmeg, and the earthy vetiver rounds it all out, making it warm and inviting.  What makes this scent even more special is its connection to French botanical history. Louis Marie Aubert du Petit Thouars was a pioneer in this field, and his legacy continues through Marie du Petit Thouars, who creates luxurious, nature-infused fragrances that are free from phthalates, parabens, sulfates, and cruelty.  And I can't forget to mention how beautiful and elegant the bottle is. It’s a stunning addition to any vanity, with a simple yet sophisticated design that perfectly reflects the refined nature of the fragrance inside.  Wearing No.04 Bois de Balincourt feels like wrapping myself in a cozy, woody embrace. It’s subtle but leaves a lasting impression—perfect for anyone who loves natural, sophisticated scents."

So sophisticated and clean. It’s well put together and would work for literally any occasion. You could get married in this but also wear it to coffee with a friend. It’s extremely versatile. Layers really well with things as well. I’ve layered citrus, floral, vanilla, etc. it grounds any scent that needs a touch of sophistication added.

That was not the case with this scent, I did not need to re apply at all. I can definitely smell the cedar wood and I love it!

I do think this scent needs to be layered as it’s too strong on its own. I like to layer this with a strawberry body spray to add a little sweetness to balance out how woody and earthy this scent is. On its own it can smell kind of like wet wood. The vetiver note is really strong and definitely overpowers the cinnamon note. The scent reminds me of what a fairy in the woods would smell like. Very earthy scent so if you only like sweet scents you will probably not like this one. The wear power on this scent is also really good.

I feel the scent is more controversial though than no. 14. Whereas I loved that one right off the bat, this one gave me a first impression of being a strange powdery scent. Another user described it as baby powder scent which I think it very accurate. There are stronger woody notes with some more subtle gourmand notes like cinnamon.  I feel this fragrance is more unisex than no. 14. Overall I am not as head over heels about this scent as I am about no. 14, but I think it may be personal preference."

The smell really reminds me of fall and I can’t wait to wear it more!"

Maison Louis Marie is a light inviting scent that demands recognition but it doesn't shout it's arrival. I paired the scent with my favorite scented lotion and it complimented it perfectly! To my surprise the scent lasted all day. I was very pleased when I first opened the beautiful box, it looked like a framed piece of artwork. The overall experience of the Eau De Parfum was very delightful."

However I was delighted at how warm and not overbearing this scent is, and absolutely perfect to add depth to some of the sweeter scents I always have in my collection. I am particularly inclined to pair it with the vanilla perfumes that I love, but it even pairs nicely with fruity scents and can elevate them into a more sophisticated and rich scent profile. The perfume is very well concentrated and lasts well throughout the day - I never really felt the inclination to reapply this scent throughout the day. I also very much appreciate the elegant and sophisticated design of the packaging that delivers a fine and even application consistently every time I’ve used it."

I believe there's something for everyone in each category, whether it be a Woody scent, a citrus scent, a gourmad, or an aquatic scent, it's just a matter of finding a perfume house which masters the art of balancing notes well, in my opinion.   I am absolutely delighted that I was able to try the Maison Louis Marie no 4 Bois de Balincourt. Upon the first few minutes of spraying this perfume onto my skin, I get a lovely nutmeg note as well as some cinnamon which is absolutely comforting, and fills my senses with ease as it takes me to memories of my childhood during the holidays with baking happening in the home and scents of woods. Sandalwood and Cedarwood is listed as a top note, but I do not find that I really get those notes until the nutmeg starts to fade away a little bit after about 45 minutes. Then the Amber wood starts to shine and take hold of the scent. This fragrance is not only comforting and fills me with a sense of ease, but it is also refined and elegant, I find that this would be a perfect fragrance during the summer for presenting masculines and for feminine energy I find myself thinking that this would be the absolute perfect fall and winter scent. This is a perfectly fresh scent and it really captures beautifully the woods and spices together in a perfectly balanced way.  Maison Louis Marie has an amazing mission as a brand as they are sustainable as a company and they do things to make their brand making a difference environmentally by being part of 1% for the planet. For those who love sustainable brands, I highly suggest researching into Maison Louis Marie."

The number 4 Balincourt was not what I expected at all, I really thought it would be more of a woodsy /earthy fragrance and it is but it has a sweetness underlying those notes. It reminds me of an expensive vintage luxury perfume, very unique in its scent. At first I wasn't sure if I liked it but I didn't dislike it right off the bat either, I have to say this is the toughest fragrance I've ever had to review because it's really difficult to describe honestly.. While wearing it I did receive a ton of compliments though which made me really think that fragrance really smells different on everyone and to everyone, this fragrance is unlike any other I've personally had, like I said it's very unique and the more I wore it the more I liked it. It's really something you have to experience for yourself in my honest opinion but it's absolutely genderless and can be worn by anyone and is really beautiful layered with the number 14 fragrance and I love the simplicity of Maison Louis Marie's bottles and packaging, they just look really beautiful on my perfume shelf as well.."

Let me tell you, Maison Louis Marie's No. 04 Bois de Balincourt totally fits the bill!  The first spritz instantly transports me to a crisp autumn afternoon.  The warm sandalwood and cedarwood base is what hits you first, but then this beautiful spiciness from the cinnamon and nutmeg peeks through. It's not overpowering, but it adds a complexity that keeps things interesting. There's also a hint of vetiver, grounding the whole scent and making it feel sophisticated and mysterious.  Here's the thing that really surprised me: Bois de Balincourt lasts.  I don't need to constantly reapply throughout the day, and even by evening, I can still catch whiffs of it on my skin.  It's not a loud perfume, but it leaves a subtle trail that feels luxurious and lingers in the best way possible.  I also love that the perfume is vegan and cruelty-free, which is a big plus for me. Plus, the sleek glass bottle and rollerball applicator look super chic on my vanity.  Overall, I'm absolutely smitten with Maison Louis Marie No. 04 Bois de Balincourt. If you're searching for a unique, woodsy fragrance that's both intriguing and sophisticated, look no further!"

This brand is amazing at creating fresh, clean and sustainable products that are para en free, vegan, no phthalates, and is clean and planet aware.

This fragrance is a masterclass in harmony, blending the richness of sandalwood and cedar with the warmth of vetiver, nutmeg, and cinnamon, all the warmth of fall but perfect a July day  From the moment I sprayed this perfume onto my skin, I was struck by its complexity and depth. The top notes of immediately introduced themselves with a soft, woody aroma that was both familiar and comforting. As the underlying scent unfolded it adding a warm, spicy quality that was addictive.  One of the things that sets No.04 apart from other woody fragrances is its ability to balance its various components with ease. As the fragrance dries down, the base notes of woody notes and amber begin to take over, leaving behind a smooth, creamy trail that is both soothing and seductive. The amber in particular is noteworthy, adding a rich, golden quality that is both luxurious and comforting.  Throughout the day, No.04 remains surprisingly long lasting, with each note working in harmony to create a scent that is both cohesive and engaging. I've found myself reaching for this fragrance again and again, whether I'm heading to work or running errands or simply want to add a touch of sophistication to my daily routine.  One of the things I love most about No.04 is its versatility. It's a scent that can be worn during any time of the year. It's equally sophisticated to wear for a special occasion or as part of a daily routine.  In terms of longevity, No.04 delivers impressive results. With regular application, I've found it lasts for at least eight hours on my skin, leaving behind a trail that's both pleasant and pleasant-smelling. And while it's not overpowering or overwhelming, I've found that it gets noticed by those around me in a good way!  I want to talk about the packaging. The bottle itself is simple yet elegant, with a sleek design that looks beautiful"

If you like earthy/woodsy scents, then I think you’ll absolutely love this one, because I sure do! I cannot even think of a gravy that smells similar to this one because it is truly unique. The top note scents of sandalwood and cedarwood make me think of a cool fall night by a warm fire- it’s truly such an inviting scent. My favorite thing about this fragrance though, is that it layers so well with anything, thanks to the sandalwood. I have tried it with warm florals, fresh scents, and even citrus- and it just adds that extra warmth and uniqueness. I also really like that this scent isn’t masculine or feminine, anyone can wear it. I can’t wait for the fall because this is definitely an autumn essential."

While I found the woody notes the strongest, I could still smell the spicy hints of cinnamon and nutmeg. I feel this perfume is a great mix of both masculine and feminine notes, although it seems others around me had mixed opinions on whether it was more masculine or feminine. I had some people say they felt it was more masculine while others say more feminine.   While it could be worn year-round and I will wear it no matter the season, I do feel it does lean more towards a fall or winter scent. It is good alone or layered and I feel when layering it with a lotion, it helps the scent to last longer. When it comes to longevity, I would say it lasts about 8-10 hours. It is not super strong, but not weak either. I would still recommend going easy on spraying yourself so you don't overdo it and seeing what amount works best for your body.   As for the bottle itself, I love the overall design and find it very elegant. It was easy to spray out and it sprays out nicely and evenly. This was my first experience with perfume from this brand and I am highly impressed and looking forward to trying out their products.  *This review was collected as part of a promotion*"

As someone who's obsessed with fragrance and constantly hunting for my next scent obsession, this one has me officially hooked!   Right off the bat, the initial spritz hits me with a surprising (yet delightful) note of cucumbers. Now I know cucumbers aren't listed in the official scent notes, but trust me! That's exactly what it's giving. It's fresh and green, an unexpected start that feels both invigorating and oddly comforting.  As the scent settles and dries down, it transforms into something that gives me serious nostalgia. Remember Abercrombie & Fitch back in the day? Think of that, but with a sophisticated twist. It smells spicy, warm, and toned down just enough to be wearable. It's like a sophisticated echo of my younger years, all grown up and polished.  But the true magic happens as the scent begins to fade (which happens sooner than I'd prefer.) This nearly disappearing act reveals my favorite version of this fragrance: sweet, soft, and woodsy. It's a subtle combination of notes that feels intimate and calming.  Bois de Balincourt is a chameleon, shifting and evolving with each wear. It’s not just a fragrance, it’s a journey through memories and moods. If you're like me and always on the lookout for a scent that keeps you guessing and leaves you enchanted, this one might just be your next obsession.

The style of the bottle is very unique which it makes it easier for you to carry it around with you on a day to day basis.

It feels very reminiscent of a something that I can't remember, but very delicious and homey.  I just can't help but keep sniffing my wrists during the first hour - it is absolutely magical.  As the day wears on, it totally transforms into a bit more masculine and musky fragrance - but gender neutral nonetheless.  The quality is extremely high from the simplicity of the packaging, to the spray, to the formula itself.  I can tell a lot of love was put into it."

But sometimes I love trying new beauty items for myself and for my clients that ask for recommendations. I wanted to try Maison Louis Marie No.04 Bois de Balincourt.       Skin type and age: combination and mid 30s   Scent:  not quiet sure how to describe it. I had my daughter help me describe it. It smells clean like laundry. Smells like it’s made for both male and female. It’s pretty mild not too strong and overbearing.      Application: easy to spray. Spray anywhere on your skin or on your clothes if you’re sensitive to fragrances on your skin. The spray didn’t ruin or stain my clothes.       The product: the scent lasted a fair amount of time without reapplying.  Overtime, my sense of smell kept thinking I was wearing freshly scented clothes but it was the fragrance.      Overall, I would recommend this fragrance. It’s ideal for anyone. It’s very pleasant."

When it rests on the skin the amber wood comes through and all together you’re left with a luxe smell.  No.4 Balincourt really reminds me of the classics. It also reminds me of a great unisex scent, its warmth reminds me of cozy rich smell. It even reminds me a bit of stealing a spritz of your partners favorite cologne so you can smell him on you. The bottle is a classic Maison Louis Marie bottle. In all Balincourt is a warm romantic scent that exudes luxury, you will smell expensive! I like to spray it on my pulse points."

This is a fragrance that is extremely versatile,as it is genderless,perfect for all occasions from casual to dressy and even though it's absolute perfection when worn alone, it can also be layered with other fragrances to create your own signature scent. I can honestly say that everything about that this brand is admirable as they not only create beautiful scents that are free of controversial ingredients,they are also planet friendly and donate a portion of every sale to planting new trees."

As someone who tends to avoid gourmand and favors woodsy scents, this scent combination hits all the right notes. This fragrance is genderless scent that's crisp and earthy, with a hint of musk and a warm spice blend. The cinnamon and nutmeg together smell strongly like cardamom to me. The addictive mix is sensual, perfect for day or night use. The throw is low to medium; it’s strong enough to smell if someone leans in, but it’s not a scent that will waft over to strangers. The glass bottle is heavy, minimalistic, and stands out in a “quiet luxury” manner. Not a complaint, just an observation is that I haven’t noticed the scent evolving over the wear time. My only real complaint is I wish the scent lasted longer than 4 hours because I want to keep smelling so good. It’s a strong 4 out of 5 stars for me."

I'm a huge fan of Sandalwood, pretty sure it was one of the first scents I fell in love with in my early 20's(also fell in love with a lot of men around that time as well lol)  The staying power is honestly my favorite take-away from this company. It lasts for HOURS on my skin. It stays put and I love laying over an additional Sandalwood oil for a little extra romantic sparkle. I don't really pick up on the Cinnamon Nutmeg though, to me it smells almost herbaceous in my opinion. I would definitely wear this on a outdoorsy type date because it's so alluring.  As always the attention to aesthetics is perfectly shown, the bottle is beautiful amongst my growing collection. Love, love, love, the only thing I would change is I wish it was a finer mist. Easy fix though is I plan on putting some in my travel atomizer so I can just pop it in my purse for easy on the go touch ups. Definitely recommend for outdoor enthusiasts.

Whether you're reading a book or you're at a bonfire, this scent will reminisce the memories and make you feel at ease. Hence Maison Louise Marie No.04 Bois de Balincourt perfume is a nice parfum to try.  This perfume has notes of Sandalwood and Cedarwood for a nice woodsy scent which blend in with a slight sweetness yet spicy with Cinnamon and Nutmeg and that hint of nature from Vetiver. It also has a lasting scent of Amber Wood too.   The perfume is alright. I like the spice and woodsy scent that blends in together however I tried to layer it with the No. 14 and it smells weird to me in my opinion. It should be paired with a lotion with a warmth and a little sweet scent to balance it out. I think it can also be worn for the fall/ winter time if you like to feel the ambience. Personally this scent reminds of Late August during the last days of summer enjoying the moments with friends before summer ends. I would recommend this perfume to anyone who has a preference for woodsy scents."

One of the most striking features of No. 4 is its genderless appeal. While traditionally categorized as a sandalwood fragrance, its allure transcends gender norms, effortlessly complementing both men and women who seek a scent that defies conventional boundaries. It's a scent that speaks of tradition and togetherness, resonating with the nostalgia of holidays past and the promise of gatherings yet to come.

I love that it's gender neutral it smells nice on men and women but as I said before I feel like it blends better with men's body chemistry. It's long lasting on its own and I have gotten many compliments on it so far. I like to wear it when I'm doing something outdoors like an art walk or street fair. My son likes to wear it everywhere so that's a plus too. Overall I'd say this is another fantastic scent from this brand definitely recommend if you're into that earthy sandlewood/cedarwood scent."

On top of that they give back to the earth by donating to help planting trees. As well as donating 1% of revenues towards the overall environment.    This scent is good for any season. Ig would be perfect for after the beach in the summer or sitting next to a fireplace in the winter. You can wear it for any occasion. Church, vacation, date night, grocery shopping. It suits anything!   When i heard it was unisex i was a bit skeptical on if i would like it or not. Usually it’s just a plain scent or smells more like a cologne to me and not something both genders can wear. I was pleasantly surprised with the scent and do fully believe both men and women can wear it with no problem.   Longevity lasts until the next day. I would put it on in the morning or even at night after i shower, long into the next day i could still smell it on me.   I can pick out the sandalwood and amber in the scent, which i love because those are some of my favorite notes in a fragrance.

It can easily be layered with other fragrances too, I tried layering with a floral vanilla and it smelled great. My husband complimented me when I was wearing it and asked for his own bottle that's how nice it is and absolutely works for any gender. unfortunately it doesn't last that long on its own, but I have my own methods to help boost the lasting power.

Top: sandalwood, cedarwood | Mid: vetiver, nutmeg, cinnamon | Base: amber wood I truly adore Bois de Balincourt; it’s light and airy enough to wear throughout the summer heat but also so cozy and creamy that I can see it being a favorite in winter too. On me, especially when spritzed onto fabrics in addition to pulse points, I can smell this all day. I even notice it lingering in the laundry basket at the end of the week which is impressive. This fragrance is particularly special because it was inspired by founder Marie Du Petit Thouars’ childhood at her family home of Balincourt and the forest that surrounds it. Maison Louis Marie is such an inspirational brand that focuses on cruelty free and clean formulas, climate neutrality, planting trees, and donating to environmental organizations with each sale. While doing all this good, they also honor a long line of family history dating back over 200 years to pioneer botanist Louis Marie Aubert du Petit Thouars, the namesake of the brand.

What makes this fragrance stand out to me is how versatile it is, that it really is a genderless scent and that it layers so well with other scent notes especially fresh floral notes. It would be perfect for so many different occasions from spending a night by the fire to a datenight or even a casual evening out. It also has great longevity as my husband and I both could still smell it six hours after application, and the sleek design of the bottle makes it super travel-friendly.

To start, I really loved the packaging because it was just so sweet and simple and allowed the actual scent to do the talking. Although, I was a bit sad because my bottle did leak during shipping. With that aside, I have to say I really am enjoying this parfum. It has such a deep and homey, but very luxurious scent to it. In my experience, it gave me this very  ethereal feeling , like I'm in the French woods in a cabin on a beautiful rainy day. It had this way to transport you to a place I've never even been before. I have found myself giving myself a spritz for work, or on an errand day and even before bed because it smells that good. I love that even if you've had a full day this scent will still creep up and remind you that it's there. I enjoyed spraying it on my wrists and front and back of my neck. I had many compliments from this scent because it is just that good. I do feel like this scent can be genderless because of the different deeper notes to it.  *This review was collected as part of a promotion"

It’s one of those fragrances that makes you feel special and confident and cozy all at the same time. I also enjoy layering it with No. 14 Icila Eau de Parfum.  What I love most is that it feels perfect for any season. If I had to describe it in one word, the word would be comfort. I am not sure why, but that is the feeling that I get. It lasts all day, even with just a couple of sprays! I also love that the bottle looks gorgeous displayed on my fragrance tray.   Honestly, I can’t get enough of it, and I’m so excited to try more from Maison Louis Marie. I highly recommend this perfume if you’re into unique, special scents!"

The box and bottle is simplistic and sophisticated - something I aim for as a 31 year old new mom trying to find my style again. This scent struck me for personal reasons as the first impression brought me back to a memory of my husband taking me on a vacation to Laguna Beach, California two years ago. It was a magical vacation we took and we stayed in a luxurious hotel - it was a very special occasion I never want to forget. Every time I wear this perfume (which has been daily) it brings me back to that trip and I feel it smells rich and suitable for everyone. It's rare for my husband and I to want to wear the same scent.. but this one works for both of us, I just won't let him use anymore since i'm going to be selfish and use it all for me, ha! The scent lasts all day on me and i've never had a stranger ask me what I was wearing until wearing this! I will be exploring more from the brand as well since I love their mission. On my bottle, the cap does not click on or stay on very well so I do wish that was improved."

I was fortunate enough to have the opportunity to try Maison Louis Marie No.04 Bois de Balincourt Eau de Parfum and I found the scent to be exquisite and unique. The cedar note of Bois de Balincourt stood out on my skin, but it blended beautifully with the other notes, and it came across as mossy and rainy. Bois de Balincourt tells a story of first kisses near a mossy brook and then snuggling up with loved ones in the estate's library and burning cedar wood in the fireplace. It's direct, powerful, effortless, elevated, and luxurious, yet so woody and earthy. The woody and spicy notes blend into this beautiful base that's so nicely layered with Maison Louis Marie's No.14 Icila Eau de Parfum, as well. "

I am not a super huge perfume person because I have people with smell sensitivities especially with the cheaper perfume lines with harsher chemicals but when I say that these smell so fresh it is unreal. I was privileged to be able to try the no. 14 and I absolutely loved it then I find out you can layer this brand to suit your scent profiles I was hooked. I got to try the no.4 also and it is more woodsy and spicy but so fresh and light in a way that's hard to explain but the naturalness of this line has made this my absolute favorite by far and will probably be the only line I use for a good while."

			"review_text": "I am a beauty enthusiast, and I have been trying fragrances for almost 7 years. I have a collection of perfumes, and I am always excited to try a new scent. Maison Louis Marie always surprises me positively with clean, high-quality perfumes. This time I tried No. 4 Bois de Balincourt, a warm, woody, and earthy scent. It opens with top notes of sandalwood and cedarwood and mid notes of vetiver, nutmeg, and cinnamon that are very striking and engaging. I noticed that the notes change over time when applied to the body. I could smell a very woody and warm scent, as if I were walking in the middle of a forest, but as time passed, the woody notes began to emerge as a pleasant mix of cedar and sandalwood. This fragrance is definitely for lovers of strong, woody scents. I was expecting this fragrance to be woody, but I didn't expect it to be that much. I can say that I liked it, but I didn't fall in love with the smell like the perfumes I've already tried from the same brand. I couldn't help but mention how wonderful the longevity of this fragrance is—that even after two showers, I could still smell it on my body the next day. Bois de Balincourt is definitely worth a try, but I recommend that you try a sample before deciding to buy as it is a unique fragrance with strong woody and warm notes, which may not suit everyone."

When I first spray it on I get a whiff of creamy spices with an almost sickly sweet (vanilla) and dirty vibe (vetiver) with a very slightly harsh undertone, just enough to keep me coming back to it as it evolves into a leathery sort of scent that reminds me of saddles and horses.  The lingering note to me is sandalwood and it lasts for a very long time.  This is definitely a fall and winter scent that will remind you of walking in the woods and sitting by the fire (outside or inside!).  Fragrance fans of sandalwood and amber scents will love this one. Maison Louis Maries' dedication to our climate with sustainable packaging, climate neutral pledges, and donations to 1% for the planet and The National Forest Foundation only make the products more lovable.

I received quite a few compliments while wearing it. I use five sprays: one behind my right ear, one behind my left ear, one behind my neck, one behind my right shoulder and one behind my left shoulder. I found that this enables the fragrance to linger and create a bubble just like an influencer recommended. It is great to have a whiff with any movements that I make every now and then. It’s a great surprise. I would suggest it to anyone who enjoys clean scents with a hint of spice."

There is something about the way the notes blended and releases with my body's warmth. It's woody but there's a subtle sweetness to it (probably the amber) which blends beautifully on my body chemistry. I understand the comparison to Santal 33, but this isn't as severe. Santal 33 has noticeable violet and leather where no 14 is softer, warmer, and more feminine in my opinion because of the sweetness and powdery finish. I am just as inlove and cannot get over it."

Days when the weather is cooler, the amber and cedarwood really dominate. I'm transported to a winter day, I'm outside with my family chopping wood and preparing for a warm gathering by the fire, with stories and laughter. This scent is a blanket of comfort and solace. It feels very familiar and calming. I love how it triggers such beautiful memories and emotions in my mindseye. On the hotter days, it changes scent. It's so different and individual from before. Those days, it morphes into a distinctive and spicy scent. It feels like a family holiday with cookies baking in the oven and pies lined up around the table. The nutmeg and cinnamon really push through, creating such a unique scent and feel. This fragrance really adapts to the weather and environment. All of the notes have a separate feel, but also all give me that warm and comforting holiday spirit. I am very fond of this scent. I think it does a wonderful job provoking timely and comforting feelings. Cheerful and Jolly are never far when I wear this. It's utterly delightful and ageless! It's a classic scent and I'm very impressed!"

This perfume has changed my mind! I now love the woodsy smells. I am able to easily distinguish between the different scents in the perfume. I can smell the Cedarwood, Sandalwood, and Amberwood for sure. The smells of Vetiver and Cinnamon are a nice addition as well. It's an all-around beautiful smelling perfume!  It brings back memories for me of my childhood spent at my aunts house on her acres of land. Playing amongst the variety of trees, picking fruits and veggies, feeding the roosters and chickens, and playing with the dogs. Just being a kid! It evokes such happy, peaceful memories for me. I really like that it can be worn all year round, in any season, and at any occasion. It's perfect for layering with other perfumes too. It's an experimental product most definitely.

With dominant top notes of sandalwood and cedarwood, mid-notes of vetiver, nutmeg and a hint of crisp cinnamon along with an amber wood base, this fragrance is a complex blend of sophisticated, romantic and mysterious scents all wrapped into one. I absolutely adore the chic, luxurious glass bottle and simplistic branding that evokes a special elegance of its own. No.04 Bois de Balincourt Eau de Parfum definitely seems like a genderless fragrance to me and definitely leans more autumn and winter season for me, but of course, you can wear whenever the mood strikes.

I am liken to the air we breath for I am light, clean, and flowing for I am Free....  MAISON LOUIS MARIE No.04 is a mysterious, eloquent, beautiful, airy, and sultry parfum yet it's earthy. I can identity with this parfum because it gives you this wanderlust feeling and you just want to flow aimlessly. On me it smells like a powdery vanilla sandalwood but it becomes sweeter as it settles. It's a gorgeous smell and so feminine. The Sandalwood is front and center but the amber wood is on its's trail. It's  woodsy but it's softened with the cinnamon nutmeg. It's just enough vetiver that it's not overpowering.  Overall, this parfum is pure mystery , but the sillage this leaves behind  is a beautiful scent that is indeed unforgettable.   Top note: Sandalwood, Cedarwood Mid note: Vetiver, Nutmeg, Cinnamon Base note: Amber Wood  ✔️ The longevity is about 8 hours  ✔️ It's a clean and fresh scent.    Thank you @ beautytap and @maisonlouismarie for gifting me this beautiful parfum.  This review was collected as part of a promotion."

As soon as I put it on I fell in love so much so that people cannot get it enough of it especially my husband. The sandalwood is so perfectly balanced, you really get the cinnamon and nutmeg with that hint of amber at the end. A light spray can last for hours. I spray it on my wrists, behind the ears and just a tad on my clothes. Not only do I smell like it all day, it lasts for days on clothing. I love that its made with clean ingredients and is good for the planet. The price point is reasonable especially since you don't need much to smell good all day. Overall this is a fragrance I highly recommend if you love woodsy and earthy scents!"

The scent is pretty strong at first, but it opens up beautifully, cheering me up. It is a warm and spicy, earthy and woody perfume. I live in a house in the forest, close to nature, and it brings harmony and calmness to my life. The same goes for this scent: the amber wood base with sandalwood and cedarwood top notes brings me to the forest near my home, even when I am far away from it. The spicy mid notes of nutmeg, vetiver, and cinnamon are deliciously warm and cozy. The notes are perfectly balanced and complement each other. This is the perfect unisex scent for all year round, but I think it’s especially fitting during the cold seasons: fall and winter. This fragrance is unique and intriguing, so rich and deep. I apply the perfume to my wrists and neck, and I can’t stop smelling my wrists during the day. It is so enjoyable! This scent is long-lasting and stays until I take a shower. I enjoy wearing this perfume alone, but I have also tried layering it with other fragrances. It is summer now, and I tried adding some floral and fruity notes on top. It also works great with citrus and vanilla scents, but I think it would be a perfect combination for the cold months.  I appreciate that the company is environmentally friendly and cruelty-free, using clean, sustainable ingredients for the perfumes and packaging, with no unnecessary plastic. I would definitely recommend this scent to everyone who loves chic, complex, warm, earthy, woody fragrances with spicy and even slightly peppery notes.

I’ve known to gravitate towards a lot of these so called men’s fragrance.  Maison Louis Marie No 4 is definitely a unisex one in the traditional sense. It is so complex and has many layers. On first spray, it reminds me of ombré leather from Tom Ford. Sharp, warm, leathery comes to mind.  I enjoy the mid notes the most on me. It becomes a sweet mellow almost honey like scent that is not candy sweet like some can be.  The packaging is simple and elegant. Lasting power on me is about 5-6 hours. It is not an overwhelming scent. I feel like I use this for myself for the feel rather than for others to get a rift."

I recently started getting more into perfumes/fragrances this year and this is such a unique one to add to my collection. This has woodsy, earthy notes to it and it absolutely is a genderless fragrance! I personally smell a lot of the spices within the fragrance (such as the cinnamon and nutmeg) but my husband seems to get just the woodsy/earthy notes from it so I truly do think this is a scent that everyone smells & receives differently. The packaging is absolutely beautiful and feels so luxurious. I love that this is a layerable fragrance, though I haven’t given that a try yet. It allows for endless options!

It matures quickly to give you a nice bite of the cedar wood rolling into the nutmeg & cinnamon which warm you as it told into its base.   It eventually settles into what I can only describe as a “fresh warmth” which seems impossible, like they shouldn’t be able to exist in the same space, yet somehow they are, and it’s pure intoxication  I expected I would enjoy this blend, yet never anticipated to what level it would grab hold. How can something be crisp while being soft, be warm while being fresh, be light while holding so much depth?  Perfect blend of these notes, a fragrance I look forward to wearing on its own year round, and seeing how it blends with some florals, & some more masculine fragrances I have as well. (This with a rose? Or a leather? Ohhh a tobacco?!!!). I will be getting so much joy here!    It lasts too! On the skin it’s all day, on the clothes? Even longer!

They also specialize is non-toxic perfumes and sustainable packaging, and are members of the fabulous 1% for the planet organization.  I'm definitely here to support that!!!   I love woody, earthy scents and was excited to try this one inspired by the perfumer's childhood home.  I love scents because of their connection with memories and I think that this is an intimate expression of that.   The top notes are sandalwood and cedarwood, mid notes are vetiver, nutmeg, and cinnamon, and the subtle base note is amber wood.  Sounds like a lot right?   The opening of sandalwood and cedarwood is somehow both true and light- it's not a heavy woody scent, despite being 100% woody.  It carries more of a powdery tone, which really comes out in the dry-down.  The vetiver, sandalwood, and amber wood start to shine after awhile, with a hint of spicy nutmeg and cinnamon.   The spray is alcohol based, and doesn't linger long on skin, but has great staying power on clothing.   This smells like a luxury perfume, but it very affordable for the quality it provides.   It's a true unisex fragrance as well (trees are for everyone hahaha).  It's become a staple in my household and I look forward to not only purchasing this one again, and discovering more from the house of Maison Louis Marie.  Well done.

No.04 Bois de Balincourt is a genderless woody fragrance with notes of sandalwood, vetiver, and amber wood.

I like to enjoy any fragrance at any time of the year, but I can definitely see this being the perfect fall/winter fragrance. A little goes a long way for me, so I am very light with my sprays and I notice that it last quite awhile on my skin and clothes. Once it dries down, I enjoy it even more than the inital spray. It can also be layered, which would enlongate the scent even more.  Since this is described as a unisex fragrance, I also had my boyfriend try it out, and he also really enjoyed it. I am looking forward to trying more fragrances and products from Maison Louis Marie in the future."

I have to say this is much different than I was expecting. I was expecting fresh, herbal, woody and it's a more powdery, clean scent. Interesting enough I don't mind it(I'm usually not into powder at all), it smells like a luxury restroom instead of a forest excursion. It's not a scent I would choose over others but I don't mind it. If the notes came off more fresh and herbal I think I'd really love it. Personally I would enjoy this scent more as a home fragrance versus one worn on myself. I would recommend to someone who enjoys powdery, gentle, masculine leaning (meaning it smells similar to traditional male centered scent) fragrance. Definitely experience for yourself because it's different than you might expect."

This scent is very reminiscent of spending the day in woods in a log cabin smelling the natural scent of the woods surrounding you. This is what this scent emulates for me. Alone this scent is enough for me BUT layering it with a floral scent just adds this other layer of dimension that is truly astonishing. I love the intiial notes of sandalwood and cedarwood which really are reminiscent of a woody environment. The scent perfectly emulates an earthy undertone and I do get a subtle note of cinammon and nutmeg which just adds to the overall musky profile of this scent. I love the versatility of this scent since it can easily be worn on its own or layered with other fragrances. The component of this fragrance is very elegant. The glass bottle feels very luxe but my only issue is that the cap/cover of the fragrance is very loose fitting so I would be careful when lifting the bottle. Other than that I love this fragrance very much and can't wait to continue using it! "

I imagine I will wear this primarily during the evening for events or date night. It will also be good for days when I have executive meetings. It is not overpowering yet pronounced and mature.   After wearing this EDP for four days, I found that the smell stayed rather well. I did pack it in my purse in case I needed to refresh and it was hardly needed. The scent stays with you even when it dissipates a bit.   I would recommend this product for anybody, like me, wanting to get out of their comfort zone. This bottle is also very elegant and will look lovely on your vanity. The one downfall is the top comes off very easy so traveling with it may not be ideal. Enjoy!"

It is sandalwood-forward and one of the less complex compositions from the brand in my opinion. That’s not a bad thing, simply a personal observation. There’s something very beautiful about a perfume that sings a simpler song and this is one that, in its simplicity, manages to evoke memories of my youth- a handmade jewelry box, pencil shavings, hay bales, coconut toasting in the oven, a crisp, new book. It’s not childish-smelling in the slightest but it truly transports me back in time in such a way that I feel a little lighter when I’m wearing it. A little more carefree, a little less weighed down by my adult preoccupations. It smells like innocence and ease.  It also layers beautifully with other fragrances from the Maison Louis Marie line. For days when I want to pull a bit more complexity out of the composition, I will layer my No. 14 Icila perfume oil underneath. For days when I want to accentuate the femininity of the perfume, I layer my No. 13 Nouvelle Vague perfume oil underneath. As with most (if not all) of Maison Louis Marie’s fragrances, No. 04 Bois de Balincourt is extremely versatile and can be mixed and matched with other scents effortlessly for a custom fragrance experience."

I don’t really get hints of the cinnamon or nutmeg in this to be honest. I don’t mind because this is a great well rounded fragrance. The notes play beautifully together. I would say that this perfume could be worn dressed up or down. For a casual brunch to a night out on the town. Very versatile. It’s not that strong so this can be a perfume you wear to work as well or around people without worrying of being overbearing. This lasts a few hours on the skin.

And staying true to their origins and vision as a company.  The packaging is effortlessly chic: simple yet elegant and lets the scent speak for itself. The bottle is practical enough to bring along on the go in your purse, yet is also a gorgeous little addition to your vanity or bedside table.  The scent itself is divine. On my skin, it settles in as a very light scent, not heavy at all, yet at the same time woodsy and vetiver-y. The cinnamon and nutmeg in it makes it smell like freshly ground, slightly peppery cardamom to me, which instantly takes me back to my childhood in Scandinavia baking cardamom buns and drinking cardamom lattes. It is layerable and I love to layer this with a touch of a warm scent. It smells elegant and luxurious, mature yet still young enough for a 40 something like myself, and I've been wearing it every day since I received it!"

Intrigued, I embarked on this olfactory adventure, but the path wasn't quite what I expected. Upon first spritz, Bois de Balincourt hits you with a strong powdery scent. While not unpleasant, it wasn't quite the woodsy escape I was craving. As the fragrance settled, the woody notes began to emerge – a pleasant mix of cedar and sandalwood. This was more in line with what I was expecting. The powder softened a bit, becoming a subtle base for the woodsy elements. I have to admit, after a while, there was a certain comforting warmth to the scent. Overall, No. 04 Bois de Balincourt wasn't quite a love story for me. The initial powdery blast was a bit too much, and while the dry down was pleasant, it wasn't enough to win me over. However, I can appreciate the fragrance's complexity and could see it appealing to someone who enjoys woodier scents with a touch of powdery elegance. Would I Recommend? Maybe. If you're a fan of woodsy fragrances with a unique twist, Bois de Balincourt is worth a try. However, if you're not a fan of powdery scents, this one might be a miss. It's definitely a fragrance you'd want to test out before buying."

It’s also comparable to quite a few fragrances I love like Le Labo Santal 33, Tom Ford, and few others and not too overbearing. It’s grounding and gentle but can be sharper the more you add. The cedarwood and vetiver give that wood tone and a hint of sweet with the sandalwood and spicy cinnamon nutmeg. This scent brings you down to earth and just one spray for me near my hair gave me this elevated expensive feel. It feels comfortable enough to wear almost anywhere as it smells fresh and clean with a nature vibe. I’ll be wearing this on the daily, love the grounding effect with it."

The cedarwood and sandalwood gives it a warm and woody base, while the cinnamon and nutmeg adds a touch of spice and complexity.   The longevity of this is amazing - it lingers on my skin for hours, evolving throughout the day without being too overpowering. I find that it’s good for everyday wear or special occasions. It strikes a balance between subtlety and presence.   The packaging is also so nice and minimal, reflecting on the heritage of the brand. It’s clear that Maison Louis Marie puts a lot of thought into every aspect of their products, from the ingredients to the design.   This is a must have for anyone who appreciates a sophisticated, well-rounded fragrance!"

It’s versatile enough to be used as a base scent or worn on it’s own. The scent has sandalwood and cedarwood, with a bit of spicy cinnamon and nutmeg in the middle and some earthy vetiver and amber in the background. The only downside is that it lasts about three hours on me.  Despite this, I am definitely interested in exploring more products from Maison Louis Marie!"

Elegant and ethereal, this fragrance wears close to the skin while still having excellent projection and wear time. Bois de Balincourt strikes the perfect balance between clean and musky, as well as fresh and arboreous. The touching personal history behind the brand, as well as the owners’ dedication to sustainability and clean ingredients, encourages me to continue to support the fragrance house and all of their endeavors.

All the amazing information on this product is crazy. If you love environmental friend products/safe products on your skin this is definitely one of those. The packaging it came in was so simple yet the perfect amount of simple. The packaging is recyclable which is perfect. You rarely see brands go above and beyond for their customers and the environment. Now the smell of this perfume is very different then anything I’ve ever smelt coming from sandalwood it smells amazing. It smells so natural and clean. I usually spray it behind my ears, wrist, stomach and, behind my knees. The warmest spots on your body that’s best for perfume to really stick and kinda activate so you smell it all day. The notes you smell the most is definitely sandalwood and cedar wood. If you are into those scents I definitely recommend trying out this perfume.   This review was collected as part of a promotion"

The woody notes provide a sophisticated base, but it's the subtle spicy undertones that really make this fragrance shine, creating a cozy warmth that's perfect for crisp fall days. There's a gentle sweetness to it as well - not overpowering, but reminiscent of the soft, almost fluffy scent of fallen leaves. It's this balance of spice and subtle sweetness that makes it so comforting. I appreciate its adaptability - it works for both office days and weekend outings. For casual wear, I use it alone, but I've found it layers beautifully with a light vanilla scent for evening events, enhancing that cozy sweetness. Its staying power is impressive. It becomes more of a skin scent as the day progresses, but that intimate, spicy-sweet aroma lingers well into the evening. I love  this sophisticated yet approachable scent that embodies the essence of autumn while still being wearable year-round."

Since I tried it the first time, I can say that I love it. The scent itself brings back childhood memories about my farmer father and the beautiful golden wheat fields. The scent is very similar to the dry wheat, it’s bittersweet and harsh. On my skin last for a few hours, on the clothes forever. The dry down is very pleasant, not overwhelming, just enough loud to be noticeable. Beautiful and simple yet refreshing and relaxing. I have no preference on how to wear it, I like it as it is and I like it layered with other earthy scents. The packaging is simple, white box with a see through bottle in it. It can easily become my new signature scent."

Initially, I had mixed feelings about its musky fragrance; it starts off quite strong but settles into a warm, inviting scent. While it's not my preferred summer fragrance, I find it becomes more appealing when layered with vanilla or Maison Louis Marie's No. 14 Icila, which has notes of jasmine, dark plum, and vanilla flower. The versatility of No. 4, especially for layering, makes it a standout. After wearing it for a few weeks, I've come to appreciate its romantic and sensual qualities, and I anticipate it will become a staple in my fall and winter fragrance collection. Plus, it leaves a lovely amberwood scent in my closet long after I've spritzed it.This review was collected as part of a promotion."

Bois de Balincourt EDP is broody, rich, almost academic. I call it dark academia because it smells like something a bookish, brooding character might wear. Sophisticated and gentle, but the cinnamon and amber create a dark richness at the bottom. Maison Louis Marie fragrances wear quite a while - I could still smell mine 5+ hours into a shift. They’re transparent enough to layer with other things, but not so much that they disappear. I’ve been delighted with my experience, and can’t wait to add more Maison Louis Marie fragrances to my collection. This one will be my second!

How it smells when you first spray it on is not how it smells hours later, which is a very neat aspect!  The woodsy scent notes in this fragrance are nicely balanced with hints of citrus.  I enjoy woodsy fragrances from time to time, but this one I enjoy enough that I could wear it daily, it really is that good.  The bottle is gorgeous and I proudly display it on my vanity among my favorite fragrance bottles.  This is a scent that is perfect for anyone young or old.  This fragrance is a vibe all on its own.

As a child growing up in India, I used to love the smell of sandalwood and I can distinctly identify it. The scent has an earthy tone, which is nice but not something I'd prefer to wear personally. I lean towards a sweeter, earthy perfume. The packaging is really simple and nice and the liquid does not irritate my skin which is a really good thing. The only reason I do not give this product five stars is because my taste does not match the fragrance and having used other variants from this brand before I had very high expectations."

The Maison Louis Marie #4 is not a strong overwhelming scent is is light and sensual scent that I found to last fairly well on my skin.

Since it has a hint of rustic charm, it perfectly layers whimsically with the brand’s NO.14-Icila. This captivating mixture gives comfort and sophistication, giving me extra confidence day and night. This fragrance is versatile, as I can wear it all year round, layered and alone, and has incredible staying power. It can adapt well to different seasons, from warmer to cooler months.

			"review_text": "I recently tried the No.04 Bois de Balincourt Eau de Parfum by Maison Louis Marie, and I must say, it's a captivating scent experience. As someone drawn to earthy and woody fragrances, this perfume delivers beautifully with its warm blend of sandalwood, vetiver, and amber wood.  The scent opens with a rich, deep aroma of sandalwood that immediately evokes a sense of grounding and sophistication. As it settles, the vetiver adds a slightly smoky undertone, complemented by the amber wood which brings a subtle sweetness without being overly sugary.  One of the standout qualities of this fragrance is its longevity and sillage. A little goes a long way, and the scent lingers for hours after application. It's perfect for cooler weather or evening wear when you want a scent that leaves a lasting impression.  However, it's worth noting that the fragrance is on the stronger side. While this can be a positive for those who enjoy robust scents, it may be overpowering for some in more confined spaces or for those sensitive to strong perfumes. I found that it works best when layered with lighter, fruity, or sweet scents to balance out its intensity and create a more nuanced aroma profile.  Overall, Maison Louis Marie's No.04 Bois de Balincourt Eau de Parfum is a commendable addition to any fragrance collection, especially for those who appreciate warm, woody fragrances with depth and character. It's sophisticated, long-lasting, and with a touch of creativity in layering, it can be adapted to suit various occasions and preferences. This review was collected as part of a promotion."

First started experimenting with my momma's treasured French vials back in the 80's and this passion has only grown since. Spent my summers working at various beauty counters and amassed a pretty impressive collection of indie, designer, niche and prestige scents over the decades.  Bois de Balincourt is a gentle but straightforward woody-spicy scent that's pretty linear and remains true to the initial spray throughout the entire wear-time. It's mostly a sandalwood-cedar-vetiver fragrance on me with the tiniest hint of nutmeg in the background. The cinnamon note doesn't translate with my body chemistry. It is my 3rd bottle of Bois de Balincourt, it's so easy to wear, whenever I can't decide what to spray, I usually reach for N°04.  If you don't enjoy pickle juice in its entirety, you should not experiment with this - the dill gherkin scent associated with sandalwood is strong.   The bottle is clear glass and has an ultra fine mister - the finest of all Maison Louis Marie bottles I own.   Truly unisex experience, easy to wear for any and all occasions. No crazy projection, sits close to skin however sillage is outstanding - some 10 hours later I still find myself enjoying it, even after getting out of the pool and taking a shower.  Highly recommend this scent for those who wanna smell clean, sharp, put together, professional - whatever the time of day and occasion."

			"review_text": "As a male who appreciates sophisticated and unique fragrances, No.04 Bois de Balincourt Eau de Parfum by Maison Louis Marie has truly impressed me. This scent is a masterful blend of sandalwood, cedarwood, and a hint of spicy cinnamon and nutmeg, creating a warm and inviting aroma that is both earthy and refined.  The fragrance opens with a fresh, green note that quickly evolves into a rich, woody heart. The sandalwood and cedarwood are perfectly balanced, providing a smooth and comforting base. The subtle spice from the cinnamon and nutmeg adds an intriguing complexity that keeps the scent interesting throughout the day.  What I love most about this perfume is its versatility. It’s perfect for any occasion, whether I’m heading to a business meeting or enjoying a casual evening out. The longevity is impressive, and I often receive compliments on how great I smell, even hours after application.  Overall, No.04 Bois de Balincourt is a standout fragrance that exudes elegance and sophistication. It’s a must-have for anyone who appreciates high-quality, well-crafted scents. Highly recommended!"

			"review_text": "The Maison Louis Marie No.04 Bois de Balincourt Eau de Parfum is a very unique, enchanting, warm, spicy, unisex fragrance! This was my first time trying this perfume! I honestly wasn’t sure what to think. This perfume had such a unique intriguing fragrance that instantly reminded me of walking through a fresh enchanting magical forest with lots of trees. Although it smelled great, it just isn’t the typical perfume I go for as a personal preference because I like more feminine, soft floral, and elegant perfumes. The Maison Louis Marie No.04 Bois de Balincourt Eau de Parfum has a more woody & earthy scent with main notes of Sandalwood, Vetiver, Amber Wood with tiny hints of cinnamon/nutmeg. It still smelled really fresh, woodsy, enchanting definitely very earthy vibes with tiny notes of smokiness/musk. I appreciated the beautiful presentation of this perfume with it coming in a beautiful, sleek, sophisticated packaging and came in a beautiful bottle! I especially love this fragrance was actually inspired truly by nature!  I felt good using this perfume because it is a clean nontoxic beauty brand made without phthalates, parabens, sulfates, and also cruelty-free. The Maison Louis Marie brand makes meaningful environmental commitments, uses sustainable ingredients and sourcing. I heard a few reviewers say that this fragrance doesn’t last very long or have good staying power but I think some people forget that with nontoxic healthier clean perfumes that don’t harm your physical health/endocrine system with powerful chemicals and additives, it naturally may not last as long as traditional perfumes that have a-lot of different additives/chemicals that help with the lasting power. I personally thought the Maison Louis Marie No.04 Bois de Balincourt Eau de Parfum lasted along time and I didn’t mind spraying more if needed. Overall, this is a great super fresh unisex fragrance that is great for you if you love very warm woodsy, earthy perfumes!"

			"review_text": "The No. 4 Bois de Balincourt is a lovely fragrance reminiscent of the woodsy outdoors. First of all, I love the story behind this perfume and that it was developed with Maison Louis Marie’s childhood in mind growing up in her family home in the forest. The top notes are sandalwood and cedar wood, which is prominent when you initially spray it, but once it dries down on the skin, the scent isn’t as overwhelming and feels balanced. Other notes are vetiver, nutmeg, cinnamon, and amber wood which adds a spicy and cozy element. The notes combined together smell earthy, woody, and slightly herbal. At first, I thought I wouldn’t like this scent profile but it has grown on me. I find that the fragrance also lasts throughout the day which is impressive with just 1-2 sprays. The packaging is simplistic but very sleek and elegant. I recommend this perfume only if you like nature, woodsy scents."

The scent is like a cozy hug, with notes of sandalwood, cedarwood, and a hint of spice that feel like a warm embrace. It's perfect for colder months when you want to feel snug and comforted.  But, if you're like me and prefer lighter scents for summer, this might not be your go-to. I find that warm, woody scents can feel overwhelming in the heat, and this one is no exception. However, as soon as the weather cools down, I will reach for this perfume.   Overall, if you love woody scents and want a perfume that will keep you cozy all winter long, this is a great choice. Just be aware that it might be too intense for summer wear."

This is what I feel when I first put on this signsture fragrance of Maison Louis Marie No.4 Bois de Balincourt Eau de Parfum. Sandlewood and cedarwood definetly have a strong tone when you first spritz the perfume on. The spicy cinnamon nutmeg mixture I get once the notes die down. The amazing part is I do not smell it on myself after a fee hours, but others do. Which means it perfectly works with my body chemistry. I am personally a flower girl bullet me tell you, once you put the No.14 on top of No.4 you have another thing coming your way. It's truly undescribable, as it's nature vs nurture, femininity vs masculinity. It's something I am very looking forward to wearing during the summer and then alone during the winter, when it comes to No.4. I love the companies outlook on creating products that are clean and luxurious. Their packaging is simple but very elegant. I love the glass bottle and amazing box packaging with just the right amount of information that everyone should read. I received a complimentary sample of  Maison Louis Marie No.4 Bois de Balincourt Eau De Parfum in exchange for my honest use and review."

They can truly help you feel confident, beautiful and bring you joy. I typically tend to lean to more floral fragrances but I still do enjoy a good earthy scent as well. Maison Louis Marie does fragrances exceptionally well and I was so excited to try this one, however for me it was much too earthy. The sandalwood is definitely one of the strong notes that is present in this fragrance. For me it was too overpowering and too earthy for what I normally go for. However if you are someone that typically enjoys earthy/woodsy scents and/or sandalwood I can see this being the perfect fragrance for you!"

Maison Louis Marie is the result of a long storied family history with scent, beginning with Louis Marie Aubert du Petit Thouars: A pioneer in French botanical history. Taking her Grandfathers sensorial lead and legacy Marie du Petit Thouars has created a climate neutral certified non toxic beauty brand with a timeless whilst contemporary aesthetic. Upon first application, an edible citrus punch. As the fragrance settles it welcomes me into an enchanted grove bursting with lush, ripe figs. An inviting flair of fresh and fruity with a milky sophisticated smokiness transporting to a sun-drenched Mediterranean garden. Top Notes: Sandalwood adds depth and a luxurious, velvety smoothness, perfectly complementing the fig's sweetness. The vetiver brings an earthy, grounding character to the perfume balancing the sweet and creamy notes and slightly woodsy aroma. Amber Wood imparts a warm, resinous depth, adding a sensual, slightly sweet warmth that lingers on the skin, creating a long-lasting and captivating trail. Overall Impression: 10/10 with an anomalous adventure. A gender neutral woody oriental scent that feels both fresh and grounded, making it perfect for those who appreciate a balance of fruity sweetness and arboraceous warmth.

			"review_text": "I first got to experience Maison Louis Marie when I tried their No. 14 Icila. I must say that I love this brand! I love everything they stand for when it comes to all the incredible work they do for the environment. They are a part of so many incredible programs that directly benefit our planet that it so very desperately needs. They are climate-neutral certified, and they give 1% back to the planet on every sale they make as well as plant 1000s of trees through the National Forrest Foundation. They have simple packaging that is adorable (the seed on the side is an actual family drawn picture from the 1800s). The No. 4 Bois de Balincourt is one of Maison's big scents. It is a unisex scent, I've never seen my husband share an EDP with me until yesterday, so men I think this is also definitely a scent you will enjoy both for you or on your SO! It's a very earthy and woody scent that is so many things like sophisticated, sensual, invigorating, and fresh. One of my favorite things about wearing this perfume is layering it. I especially love combining it with the No. 14. It's The perfect mix of fruity/floral and earthy. The top notes for Bois de Balincourt are cedarwood and sandalwood, with a base of Amberwood and mid notes of cinnamon, nutmeg, and Vetiver. I must say I've never actually worn a Vetiver scent until now, and the Vetiver is a strong element in the mid-notes. It's a very woodsy, creamy and warm perfume. I have also learned it layers well with water-scented perfumes, it mixes well with most scents I've tried so it's a very universal layering tool.  I think if you like the woody/earthy vibe this is a perfume for you I also believe once you get a whiff of this amazing company scents, and look more into the brand, you will grow to love how they cherish the true art of perfumery and just how much they respect our natural world."

I have got two compliments on this perfume since I started wearing it.  I think others must enjoy the scent as well.

It has very similar scent notes to Le Labo Santal 33 and R’ddle Santal.

The price point is much more affordable than its similarly scented fragrances at under $100 for a 50ml bottle. I have not had the opportunity to experience the other scents offered by MLM, but I fully intend to purchase the discovery set they offer so I can try layering with other scents. No. 4 is a wonderful stand alone scent, but can easily layer with your other favorite scents.

It is not sweet smelling nor overpowering yet it is still nice and strong. I am a now a new fan of woody scents due to trying this scent. I feel it could be perfect for anyone to use since it is kind of a neutral/meet in the middle scent. The other thing that I adore is that this company uses clean and environmentally friendly ingredients. This includes being BHT and cruelty free. I layered this with a couple of different perfumes and honestly, the options are endless with this since it pairs really well with most perfumes. I definitely recommend this scent for anyone looking to add a unique scent that can be layered to their perfumes."

Upon the first sniff, I noticed a warm, woodsy, and earthy aroma. It's a scent that stands on its own and doesn't need to be layered, although it can be. No. 04 is a scent that evokes a specific memory for me—happy memories of camping in the warm summer, connecting with nature. It takes me back to a time of tranquility, soaking up the sun, swimming in the lake, and appreciating the world's true beauty, away from the chaos of everyday life."

Their fragrances always take me back to some point in my life and this fragrance wasn’t any exception for me growing up in Maine this took me back to the countless days I used to go on hikes or play in the many woods that Maine has to offer as a girl , teenager and woman . Also the sandalwood and cedar wood really stick out in this fragrance. With the cinnamon and nutmeg giving me memories of a couple things that I love to make , those two things being French toast and pumpkin pie blended with the woody scents this is such a great fragrance. This is genderless and has a great staying power . I have had people ask me what I am wearing and tell me I smell good . This can be worn in different seasons and on many different occasions. It’s not overpowering or to light . The sprayer sprays just the right amount and the bottle it’s self is simple but yet sleek ."

In my view, the stars of the show are the sandalwood and amber wood, which help the scent to create an image of a trail in the middle of an ancient mystical forest in summer-fall weather. It’s definitely unisex and beautiful seductive woody scent I must say. It’s warm, without the spiciness, with a hint of nutmeg sweetness. The longevity is quite good for this EDP version (stays strong for 2-3 hours then stays as skin scent throughout the day on me). I’m totally in love with this scent. It can be a comforting and lovely scent on its own. Or, it can be a great layering scent that adding a great earthy depth to its combination. I think It works great to layer with any fresh or fruity scent. Personally, I love to pair it with No.14 Icila. This combination is my new favorite daily scent: A warm, fresh woody scent with a hint of sweetness. If you like woody/earthy scent, I definitely recommend this scent for sure."

Very slight hint of spice and woods, yet cool and powdery at the same time. It isn't too sweet, perfect for any gender, and gives a feeling of comfort! It's very light as air, but seems to stay with me throughout the day.  As an Esthetician, I feel I can wear it around clients as well, it's that light and totally inoffensive!  I use a light lavender oil under it, and it works great to enhance that comfortable feeling."

On its own it’s very subtle, which is good for people who are sensitive to smell, but I want my fragrance to be noticeable!

I couldn't love what I do any more and only wish to help more people through my knowledge and training of skin and makeup practices as well as my education on nutritional supplements. I am 36 with three kids and the signs of aging are creeping up faster than I would like! I love to try things to combat that while staying out of a doctors office. This perfume is so elegant. I can smell the warm sandalwood and amber right off the bat. It reminds me of fine dining next to a fireplace in the comfort of familiar guests. I love pairing it with a vanilla or sweet floral to level it up to a more feminine note. However, it isn’t not feminine on its own. I can see this being worn when autumn is beginning and leaves are changing color. It is such a comforting smell and one I really enjoy!"

I will say this may not be for everyone as it does have a sharp smell that may cause headaches for some. YET for ME as a beauty enthusiast who doesn’t stick to rules of perfumes being for “certain seasons” and loves a variety of scents this one will be in rotation all year long as it’s a nice clean scent on my skin. I find this projects very well on my skin and clothes. I did apply it to well moisturized skin after applying unscented body lotion and body oil which will help with longevity as scent clings better to moisturized skin. For me I find this fragrance mixed with my body chemistry does make it smell slightly sweet which I enjoy. This perfume is definitely for someone who wants to feel comfy and cozy in my opinion. Imagine being wrapped in a nice warm freshly washed blanket watching your comfort show; or maybe lounging in your sundress having a picnic in the park. That’s the images and vibes it gives to me. The only reason I rated this product a 4/5 is due to the fact I think for such a beautiful fragrance the bottle is a little cheap feeling."

The air was humid and thick with the scent of wood from the wet trees and grass. So I smelling my arm I got the full experience of Maison Louis Marie’s No.04 Bois de Balincourt Eau de Parfum. After I spritz, and let it settle, I smelled the notes and was transported to a serene woodland where the fragrance of nature consumed me. The top notes of sandalwood and cedarwood introduced at first, creating a warm, woody embrace. As the scent settles, the heart reveals a spicy blend of cinnamon and nutmeg, adding a touch of comfort and complexity. The base notes of vetiver and amber wood provide an earthy, grounding finish that is personsal on the skin, recreating a cozy evening by a fire on a camping trip.

The moment I spritzed it on, I knew I was in for something special. The warm, woody notes are like a cozy embrace, with hints of sandalwood, vetiver, and amber wood creating a beautifully balanced aroma.  The reactions were instant and amazing – my coworkers were immediately curious and kept asking what I was wearing, and my husband couldn’t stop raving about how phenomenal it smelled. This fragrance is perfect for day or night, adding a touch of elegance and mystery to any occasion.  Maison Louis Marie has nailed it with this one – it’s luxurious, clean, and planet-aware, making it a guilt-free indulgence. If you’re on the hunt for a new signature scent, you’ve got to try Bois de Balincourt. It’s a total game-changer!  - This review was collected as part of a promotion."

To get the full scent profile, it needs to settle into your skin for a few minutes. I was drawn to this fragrance because I’m a fan of sandalwood and amber wood notes, but No.04 has a very different scent than the typical woodsy perfume. It’s totally unisex in my opinion, much more appealing than the run of the mill woodsy cologne. The nutmeg and cinnamon really stand out to me, a perfect pop of spice among the refreshing woodsy notes. Like other Maison Louis Marie fragrances, it smells inherently luxurious and sophisticated. It has a standard lasting power, and it sprays beautifully into a super fine mist. Overall, a lovely unique fragrance.  *This review was collected as part of a promotion*"

The scent is a perfect blend of sophistication and warmth. The woody and earthy notes create a calming, yet invigorating aroma that lasts throughout the day. It’s subtle enough for daily wear but distinctive enough to feel special. I’ve received so many compliments on it!  It’s like a little luxury that I get to enjoy every day, adding a touch of elegance to my routine. The fragrance is also long-lasting, so a little goes a long way, making it a great value.  It’s a beautiful fragrance that adds a touch of luxury to my everyday life. Thank you, Maison Louis Marie, for creating such a delightful perfume!  I highly recommend this perfume to anyone looking for a timeless and sophisticated scent.  **This review was collected as part of a promotion."

			"review_text": "I am a health-conscious scent enthusiast. I have been looking for a perfume that is subtle and does not give me a headache. I am also concerned about the many hidden chemicals that are toxic endocrine disruptors because of health issues I have become more aware of what I put on my skin. Thus, I was above and beyond thrilled when I learned about the mission and promise of the Maison Louis Marie. I read through all the ingredients and even scanned it through an app that lets you know if it has anything harmful in it. To my excitement, the Maison Louis Marie No. 04 Bois de Balincourt Eau de Parfum passed the test with flying colors! It was clean and free of parabens, sulfates, and other harmful toxins you find in other brands. So, if you are concerned about your health this brand is a hit out of the park with clean ingredients. The brand is known for its deep respect for the natural world and for making the ordinary extraordinary, hence its focus on quality ingredients and utilizing recycled cardboard for the packaging as well as gorgeous glass bottles. I would agree that Maison Louis Marie is an expert at taking things to the next level. From the elegant packaging to the experience of putting on the perfume they are truly genius in their formulations. When I spritzed it on my wrists and neck it brought an immediate rush of calm through my body. This is the most comforting and sophisticated scent. The first note I picked up on was the sandalwood. As it settled on my skin, I was delighted by the sweet yet woody warmth of vetiver, nutmeg, and cinnamon that hugged my nose. This scent can be layered, but it is a true hero for those wanting to evoke a warm, romantic, sophistication. I also love that this scent is unisex for those who do not want a floral sweet scent. This perfume gets a 5 out of 5 from me and has officially become my signature scent. I never got a headache, it passed the clean test, and it is the warmest and most sophisticated scent that feels like home."

To my nose, this smells classy, expensive, sexy, warm, and just all around amazing. The longevity is my only complaint, you'll definitely need to be reapplying throughout the day on your skin. Lasts a but longer on clothes. But that's to be expected with a clean fragrance. This is fantastic for layering as well, I imagine this would layer well with so many scents but a few favorites are with TF Soleil Blanc, MM Replica Beach Walk, and Pacifica Neon Moon."

However, how I’ve come to love this is by layering with vanilla!! It adds that necessary touch of warmth and sweetness I feel the fragrance needs. I use Vanilla Woods by 7 Virtues and I’m loving this combo. But I won’t be purchasing a full size because layering is too much work lol I’m trying to find the perfect fragrance for me without needing to add more notes on top because this fragrance just feels incomplete to me and like it’s missing something.

I cherish it and use it sparingly due to the CRAZY price tag ( but is worth every penny) Without knowing this a dupe I tried it in store and melted.. you know that feeling when you fall in love with a scent. I contemplated between the Parfume and the oil but went with the parfume since I like to spray but will be going back for the oil to keep in my bag to touch up. It’s warm, earthy, slightly masculine but a floral note that keeps it feminine. It’s definitely an any time of the year scent but I will be using this as a transitional scent between summer and winter more than wearing in the hot summer months. If you like sweet,girly scents this i isn’t it.  It’s warm and sexy yet not over powering so it’s safe for the office but perfect for nights out. I’m a huge fan and if you are considering Santal 33… try this first. I put my sample of Santal on one Wrist and this on the other and it’s not much difference .. especially for the price difference .. ( and thankfully.. not even close to smelling like pickles on me lol )"

It actually works really well with my body chemistry once it warms up. The main note that I notice though is vetiver, then the amber & cedar & sandal wood. It really compliments the deodorant that like, which is made with sandalwood & vanilla. I find it very calming & relaxing, like the types of essential oils that my Yogini would diffuse in her classes. It's the most unique scent that I've ever tried. It's not like anything else I have ever worn, but honestly, it has become my new favorite. I'll be purchasing the full-size ASAP because my sample is gone!"

I will say- when I first purchased from a boutique in my City, I felt like I needed 1 spray to last all day - unfortunately that bottle lost its life at my friends basement when the glass bottle broke in his apartment ( he still smells it, and that was last  February) SO  not sure if they changed the formula but the one I purchased recently doesn’t last. The same with the oil I purchased. It’s a full 3-4 spritz/spramps until I can get my desired scent. it’s weird. I would LOVE the stronger version back - but I’ll still continue to purchase this fragrance :)"

			"review_buyer_description": "Blue eyes, blonde hair, Light skin tone, Combination skin",
			"review_text": "I am only giving this a 3rd star because this perfume smells like a gentler version of Fahrenheit by Dior.  Fahrenheit adds a nostalgic sentiment of value (for me) related to good moments in my youth.  Why has no one made a direct comparison to Fahrenheit?  I haven’t been able to sample Labo’s Santal, but if it approximates the scent as accurately as some reviewers believe, here’s an idea; spray some Fahrenheit onto one pulse point and repeat w/ No.3 Bois de Bamuncourt on the other.   I guarantee Dior’s F. will outlast by hours and won’t have any residue that smells like cheap bathroom fragrance lingering behind.  In fact, beyond an hour of wear, this perfume fades & cheapens, while Dior’s will linger (keep in mind Fahrenheit is a men’s cologne that is very strong).  Nevertheless, feels like both use the same top notes that attract ppl to this scent, but Dior’s version is cheaper (on sale quite often too).   Someone suggested this to me and once I smelled it, I absolutely agreed - yes! It’s exactly what this scent reminds me of...but a cheaper, diluted version that leaves a weak and strange scent behind (which I very much dislike).  I’m wondering how many of you would agree w/ a direct comparison."

Also, for those who believe this smells like Le Labo you are correct, but the rollerball is more nuanced then Santal 33. It also has the feel of Diptyque's Philosykos but w/out the fig note. It is a creamy soft fragrance that smells cozy but also clean and fresh, which is a combination that is very hard to pull off. The full size is like they took the rollerball and watered it down, and does not come close to having the pitch and throw of the rollerball."

This reminds me of that but a more upscale/grown woman/not from the grocery store version. I'm sensative to smells so don't enjoy anything strong or overly lingering. Like musks. I never buy body sprays because they're typically too artificial everything. NO THANKS Victoria. A scent should meld with your skin and this does that. It also means I can bathe in it without it becoming over powering because it chills right down and becomes one with your essence. But that doesn't mean it doesn't last. I can still catch a hint of it on my wrist the next day. Anyone complaining about this disappearing on their skin is likely becoming nose blind to it (yes that's a thing). If you enjoy smelling yourself no matter where you are, this won't be for you. One cigarette and you'll have to reapply. liberally. Over all (on me) it is light, slightly sweet, warm, and fresh without becoming too powdery. I do get a hint of powder, but it's faint. I don't read this as floral or fruity at all. Like I said, sweet tea and clean laundry. For reference my favs are Burberry Brit Sheer for her in spring/summer, by rosie jane Angie for summer floral, by rosie jane Leila Lou for autumnal fruit, Replica By The Fireplace in fall/winter, and L'Occitane Neroli & Orchidee for life."

It’s rare for me to get this excited about a perfume but it’s honestly that beautiful. I haven’t tried the oil, but will consider it down the road.

I truly was hoping for something spicy, sultry and evocative but this just smells like wet socks that have marinated in pickle juice!!! So gross!!! Unfortunately, projection, sillage and longevity are quite strong so I am trying to not gag...but I had to see what all the rave was about... I also very much disliked No.05 Kandili, but at least, I tried it on and let it stay for several hours... They are both going back. If you want something spicy, woody and Smokey, try Vanilla Woods by the 7 Virtues. Now that is a wonderful scent made by a wonderful company!!"

This is definitely a dupe for Le Labo Santal 33. My body naturally turns things a little sweeter so if yours does as well, after an hour or so this scent on my skin has the slightest warm vanilla musk layered into the woodsy scent. It's very clean and natural, doesn't smell artificial or give you a headache, and reminds me of nature and winter. If you like mixing perfumes, this goes well with the Atelier Cologne Vanilla Insensée. Those two together have become my signature scent. Overall, this is a great choice for those who like the earthy and woodsy smell without it being too overpowering or masculine."
