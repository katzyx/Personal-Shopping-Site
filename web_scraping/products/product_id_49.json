			"review_text": "After seeing soo many mixed reviews that are vastly different from eachother on this fragrance, and knowing what it smells like on me, I think this perfume really just depends on skin chemistry.   This will smell different on everyone. On me, this literally dries down and ONLY smells like a soapy grapefruit (which is the bergamot), But it smells very specifically of grapefruit. I don’t get a single tad bit of woodiness or florals, tonka, cotton candy, or anything else. Just GRAPEFRUIT with a clean soapiness.  Skin chemistry is so interesting lol.  So for that reason, I don’t think this is a safe blind buy at all.. Take every review with a grain of salt bc this will likely smell different on you. I am SO glad I didn’t buy the huge 4.2oz bottle. But paying $32 for the 10ml travel spray was total a rip off.."

I'm very disappointed. I can't even describe the scent because there aren't any aromas that I recognize."
