I do still think the price is a bit much, but the formula and color is nice enough that I dare to say it's worth it. I bought shade 01, and it's the perfect everyday contour shade for my lips. It has enough pink to keep it looking natural with some oomf. The aspect of this particular lip liner that makes it worth it to me, is the fact that it almost stains your lips a tiny bit. It makes the formula so much more long wearing without being drying or gross looking."

			"review_text": "So I really tried to put off leaving a review but after trying it for the third time I really had to. This product is 0.012 oz for $18 for the sake of my preference I compared it to MBM lip liners. Makeup by mario lip liners  are 0.049 oz for $24 so the difference in OZ is 0.037 and the price difference is $6. So you decide if it‚Äôs worth it to you. As for me I rather pay the extra $6! These liners are creamy and go on really nicely, BUT O truly did not get any staying power from them for $18 they and that much low product it should at least stay on for a while! When I put it on and put any type of lip oil or lip gloss it will immediately want to run everywhere and transfers like crazy! It doesn‚Äôt even last long and even if i do leave it on without any type of oil or balm it still doesn‚Äôt last. So I truly don‚Äôt understand the good reviews on this product. Because these were a blind buy for me and I purchased them based on the reviews online. I never like returning anything and even if i do not like something i keep it and use it all the way but for these I have to return because I bought 5 out of 6 and I absolutely cant stand them because of the crazy transfer after applying any type of lip product on top."

The pigment is rich, so a little bit goes a long way!  3. The shade is perfect for everyday wear, or adding to a more dramatic nighttime look if I felt like it! 4. The applicator is precise, but the soft formula allows for a great smudgey, lived-in look‚Ä¶  Freck does it again, and I can‚Äôt wait to get my hands on Shade 5 next :)  This was gifted by freck in exchange for my honest feedback"
