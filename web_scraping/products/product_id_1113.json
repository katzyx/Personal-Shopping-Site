The clinical results weren't lying - it really does lock everything in place immediately!  What I love most about this spray is how it gives my skin this beautiful, glassy glow. The combination of hemp-derived cannabis seed extract, hyaluronic acid, and niacinamide provides incredible hydration and keeps my skin looking dewy and fresh all day long. The green cannabis glow phase adds that extra boost of hydration that really locks in the moisture.  As someone who appreciates clean beauty, I'm thrilled that this is an alcohol-free formula. The natural aloe scent is subtle and pleasant, and I love that I can refresh my makeup throughout the day without any sticky residue."

It’s super hydrating, thanks to the hyaluronic acid, and the niacinamide helps smooth and brighten my skin.  I love that it’s a 3-in-1 product:  As a primer, it grips my makeup perfectly.  As a setting spray, it locks everything in place with a natural, dewy finish.  And as a refresher, it instantly wakes up my skin throughout the day.  The spray feels lightweight, and it doesn’t leave my skin sticky or greasy. I also appreciate that it’s vegan and cruelty-free. My only tip is to shake it well before using it to activate the dual-phase formula.  If you’re looking for a long-lasting, hydrating setting spray, this is definitely worth trying!”"

This product ensures makeup stays intact even in heat, humidity, or under intense lighting during extended sessions. I’ve also found it works wonderfully when applied in layers—first to set the foundation and then as a final touch for the complete makeup look. One of my favorite details is its practical, user-friendly packaging, which allows for an even application. Additionally, its formula includes hydrating and soothing ingredients that not only extend the wear of makeup but also care for the skin."

It gives a healthy, dewy finish without feeling sticky or heavy. The travel size makes it so convenient for touch-ups on the go, especially during long days or travel. My makeup stays put, and my skin feels hydrated—perfect for winter dryness. Highly recommend this for anyone looking for a glow-up and long-lasting hold!"

I sprayed it on my skin before makeup application as a primer, which was faster than having to rub a primer all over my face.

I was so impressed by how well my makeup held up throughout the day—no smudging, no fading, and by the end of the night, it still looked fresh, almost like I had just put it on. What I love most is the dewy, glowy finish it gives. I have oily skin, so I’m usually cautious with “dewy” products, but this spray somehow makes my skin look radiant without looking greasy. It’s that perfect glow—shiny in the best way! For the formula, it’s clean and fragrance-free, which is a huge win for my sensitive skin. The mist is super fine, and I barely need a few spritzes to get full coverage, so a little goes a long way. It doesn’t feel like I have anything extra on my face either, just a nice, fresh layer that keeps everything locked in. This spray has definitely earned a permanent spot in my routine!"

This dual-purpose spray works both to lock in your makeup and to give your skin a refreshing boost throughout the day. The standout feature for me is how hydrating it feels. With aloe and hyaluronic acid in the formula, it’s perfect for keeping my skin plump and dewy without looking greasy. After applying makeup, I use this spray to set everything in place, and I’ve noticed my makeup lasts significantly longer without melting or fading, even in humidity. What’s great is the fine mist – it covers evenly and doesn’t leave any wet patches or disrupt the foundation underneath. It’s lightweight and dries quickly, which is another plus. I also love it as a midday refresh, especially if my skin feels tight or looks dull. Just a few spritzes bring back that fresh, glowy look without having to reapply makeup. Overall, it’s a versatile, skin-friendly setting spray that lives up to the hype!"

As someone who has oily skin, I tend to want to mattify my makeup looks, but with the heat and with the potential opportunity to sweat, a dewy setting spray actually makes more sense. I wore it two nights in a row in two very different settings. The first night, out to dinner with my little ones which can be a lot of work. The second night with my girlfriends and the restaurant was a little on the warm side. My makeup didn't slide, but I also didn't look super greasy. I will say if you have oily skin it definitely depends on how oily you get. The dewy look may not be for you, but I actually enjoyed it and didn't want to take my makeup off at the end of the night. I've also been having trouble with under eye creasing so I sprayed some of this on my beauty blender which definitely helped with setting my under eyes. I plan to continue using it; it's actually a really great amount for a travel size. I also appreciate the slight shimmer that it has. This is my first time ever using a product from milk; so far so good. I would definitely recommend."

It simultaneously leaves your skin looking hydrated, refreshed, gives that glow from within feel, all while setting your makeup in place! (The photo on the left is before I applied the setting spray and the photo on the right is after I applied). It’s not sticky, it’s lightweight,  and I feel like my makeup looks better the longer I have it on! It’s literally all in the name, it grips onto your makeup for long wear and hydrates your skin all in one! Because I have combination skin, after about 7-8 hours of wear, I have to slightly touch up my t-zone (which is no qualm at all, it’s the norm for me!), while the rest of my face looks glassy not greasy! Will definitely be repurchasing once I run out!"

All my contour looks streaky and inevitably my mascara rubs off and leaves marks below my eyebrows, which doesn't happen with other sprays such as the Milani make it last. Also, it seems like there is some oil within the spray that separates, so you have to make sure you shake the bottle before use. Again, great spray for light, dewy, 5-4-hour makeup, but not good for a full day of makeup."

This setting spray is very lightweight, it sprays very light and doesn’t feel like nothing on the skin. This setting spray is definitely staying in my makeup bag. A complaint that I have tho is that it came in a bottle with a loose cap and some setting spray leaked from the packaging."

My skin looks naturally dewy and glowy without appearing greasy, which is a game-changer for me. It truly enhances the overall look of my makeup.  I put this spray to the test during a long day at work, and it held up beautifully. My makeup didn't budge, melt, or fade for up to 12 hours, just as promised.  One of the standout features for me is the clean, alcohol-free formula. My skin tends to react poorly to alcohol-based products, often feeling dry and tight. With this setting spray, I experienced none of that discomfort, in fact It feels hydrating and soothing."

I like the new formula too since I tried this back when it first released, but I like that they changed it to less colorants in this formula.

It is not scented at all. The mist isn’t the finest I’ve seen but it’s still on the side of a mist rather than a spray. To put this to the test I swatched a glitter and matte eyeshadow, sprayed it with the spray, and then did two more swatches with no spray. I rubbed over all of the swatches after the spray dried to see how well the eyeshadow stayed put. The top two had the spray. You can see the shimmer moved around quite a bit but not nearly as much as the swatch with no spray. The matte shade smudged a little with the spray applied but not nearly as much as any of the others. You can decide for yourself if you like this level of staying power. Personally I think this is good since I don’t get that much rubbing on my face."

I put my makeup on at 5am and rinse off around 9pm and it still looks amazing!"

Not only does it keep my makeup in place all day long, but it also gives my skin a refreshing boost of hydration. The lightweight formula feels amazing on my skin, and I love how it helps to minimize the appearance of pores. Plus, the convenient spray bottle makes it easy to use on-the-go. Overall, this spray has become a must-have in my beauty arsenal, and I can't imagine my routine without it!"

I do not feel like my makeup looks better after spraying this. my hydrating creamy concealer becomes drying after a few hours from using this."
