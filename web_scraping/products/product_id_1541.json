And my experience being able to use it as a beauty  enthusiast With a mature skin I have to say that I’m very pleased with this serum , when you apply the serum it sinks in right away. I feel as the alcohol in this formulation is helping the ingredients penetrate more deeply. If you aren’t a fan of alcohol, you can stay away from this. Alcohol can dehydrate  skin, but Sulwhasoo seems to have included some deeply hydrating ingredients to counteract this effect. I did some research, and the effect of alcohol on skin has actually be studied quite a bit and they’ve found no real negative side effects, long or short term. But i don’t need research to know this serum makes my skin feel so healthy. The results is a velvet, beautiful texture that sinks in to the skin leaving you feeling refresh and hydrated. The scent is  herbal-ish but light, it fades after a few seconds and i don’t minded.  It doesn't irritate the skin at all, it doesn't leave it greasy, once it dries it seems like I haven't applied anything. My skin feels hydrated and I feel like it's too soon to say if I've noticed any other changes besides hydration."

I have fine lines under my eyes and slight crows feet and I should have taken a before pic ( early 40’s). I’ve tried eye creams and several other creams and serums to try and diminish and slow the look of them. This serum within a couple of days made my eyes look so much better, when I smile my crows feet are dramatically softened. My under eyes look more hydrated and plumper. This alone has sold me, I will not ever run out of this after today. It has been a couple of weeks, I apply morning and night to my face and neck. My skin looks more youthful with and without makeup on and has this glowy radiance to it. This serum feels cool and is somewhat watery but at the same time has a slight tackiness to it. Once dry the skin feels very soft and smooth and you continue with the rest of your skincare routine. It has so many good ingredients such as ginseng, Korean herb extract and vitamin c. This is absolutely worth every penny if you are looking for aging prevent and hydration."

I could feel a change from the first use. It provides both a wonderful weightlessness and an intense splash of moisture. Immediately, my skin felt softer and more balanced, and eventually the evidence was irrefutable. I saw a noticeable brightening, smoothing, and evening of my skin tone after four weeks. It's not often that a product can actually fulfill its promise of handling multiple signs of aging! This is a serum that because of its formula makes everything you apply afterwards absorb into the skin better. It makes all the moisturizers and treatments work better, which in turn makes my entire routine more efficient. It smells incredibly calming and the application process (pressing it into your damp skin) is a mini self-care ritual in itself. This is the product you need to step up your skincare game. Highly recommend!"

You will without a doubt see a difference, the first time you put the serum on your skin. It goes on so nicely and dries quickly but not sticky. My skin looked and felt glowy from this serum and I hadn't done my other skincare yet. Once I completed my skincare, I found that it made my other products absorb much better than normal. The proof was in the dewy, hydrated look of my skin. I definitely recommend this for anyone with dry skin looking to help their moisturizer absorb better. I continued to use it for a week twice a day with my regular routine and this serum will now be a permanent in my ritual. Try it!!! You won't regret it!!!"

I've tried so many serums and you don't really notice much of a difference with most of them. I noticed a notable difference after the first use. I was convinced after the second use that it was doing something good. With each use my skin feels softer and tighter. Smoothing the fine lines. It's also making my face appear more awake. I have what I call tired skin. The more tired I am the more I have lines that pop out. This serum tightens and moisturizes in unison to help my droopy face on the roughest days. This serum really does work. I love the texture. It's not sticky. It absorbs really quick so I can continue my routine morning and night.  This review was collected as part of a promotion."

But the real miracle here is that I swear I noticed a difference in my skin from the first day I tried this.

That said, the serum feels amazing on the skin. It absorbs quickly without any sticky residue, leaving a hydrated and slightly plumper feel. Over time, I’ve noticed a subtle improvement in my complexion—it appears a touch more radiant and healthy-looking.  One of the highlights is the packaging. The bottle is gorgeous, with a smooth matte finish that feels luxurious in hand and looks stunning on the vanity.  Overall, despite the strong scent, this serum delivers on its promise of improving skin texture and glow. If you can get past the fragrance, it’s a lovely product to incorporate into your regimen.

I began using 2 pumps of the serum all over my face and an additional pump patted into my t-zone after cleansing with a hydrating wash. My skin quickly began to feel firmer and fresher.   I am still struggling with some dryness - due to lingering immune system issues - but my skin looks and feels younger. In a week’s time, I’ve seen drastic improvement and I cannot wait to restock during Black Friday.

Now that I have incorporated this into my routine I am never going back. Right when I get out of the shower or finish cleansing my skin, my skin can feel tight. However after using this serum before I even use my hydration mist my skin already feels so juicy and plump! There is also a noticeable glow and I have noticed after applying all of my skincare my makeup even sets better! The product has a texture that’s a mix between a serum and a facial oil which feels amazing! The fragrance smells very earthy and sweet. I feel like my skin holds onto moisture longer than before which I’m really happy about. The packaging of this product is top tier! It’s a nice solid glass (?) bottle that is not only aesthetically pleasing for a bathroom counter, but is also incredibly durable. The bottle is quite large and the product goes a long way.

I believe its ginseng. The product is light weight and blends immediately into the face upon application. I noticed that my facial moisturizer was quickly absorbed after applying the serum. I did notice some radiance as well, so the product complements my facial moisturizer. I look forward to continued use of the product over time and am anxious to see the results after long term use."

It does not replace your normal serum. Instead, you use it as the first skincare step after cleansing, and it helps to strengthen your skin barrier, lock in moisture, and help your other products work better. I really liked how this serum felt on my skin. It was lightweight and silky, absorbing quickly while also providing lasting hydration.

The First Care Activating Serum adds hydration and radiance to your face. You also get anti aging benefits as you use the serum long term. I will say with my experience I did use 3 pumps of the serum to cover my face. If I used only two pumps the product felt tacky and sticky. With 3 it glides over my skin and felt wonderfully hydrated. I let the First Care Activating Serum absorb for a min or so and continued with my routine. I highly recommend the First Care Activating Serum for anyone with dry skin or anyone that wants to boost the effectiveness of their favorite beauty products."

I did experience some tingling with the first few applications after washing my face but it disappeared pretty quickly. The product does contain Vitamin C so it was no surprise.

With each product that you use, you can feel the merging of ancient traditions with modern advancements, and their Activating Serum is no exception! The texture is very thin and runny which not only  feels refreshing but allows the serum to sink into the skin quickly. Once applied, my skin looks brighter and plumper and it paves the way for the rest of my skincare routine, helping my other products to penetrate deeper making them more effective. After continued use my skin feels and appears firmer and thanks to the ginseng, my moisture barrier has been restored and strengthened. The only negative thing I experienced with this serum was some minor breakouts when I first started using it, but that has since stopped and cleared up. I highly recommend this serum to anyone who wants to achieve that “glass skin” look with minimal effort and clean ingredients."

I’m a big fan of this brand, and as a licensed Esthetician, I truly value high-quality products and well-formulated ingredients. I’ve enjoyed using several of their products in the past, but here’s my honest take on this new formula.  This activating serum initially seemed promising, as it feels nutrient-packed and provides a slightly tacky texture that aids in better absorption of other products. Unfortunately, in my experience, it didn’t quite live up to its claims of strengthening the skin’s moisture barrier or balancing water and oil levels. While it’s a solid option for layering and prepping the skin, I found it lacked the level of hydration and humectant properties I was expecting. While it’s not a bad product, it doesn’t fully meet my needs, and I don’t think I’d purchase it again."

I have always loved K-beauty brands and believe Korean beauty is so far advanced in comparison to other countries and the Sulwhasoo brand really shows this advancement. The first Care Activating Serum is used a bit differently then you would normally use a Serum, it's to be used immediately after cleansing and before using any toner or Essence. This Serum improves signs of aging, moisture balance, repairs any barrier issues, helps plump the skin and what I find really great is that it preps the skin for better absorption before applying the rest of your skincare routine which will in turn allow the rest of your products to really do what they are meant to.. I absolutely love the scent of the First Care Activating Serum, I typically don't like fragranced skincare products but this scent is due to the natural ingredients in the formula including ginseng which is what they now added to the new formulation. It smells like a luxury spa and is very soothing on the skin when applying, it absorbs very quickly and doesn't leave any tackiness behind allowing you to immediately apply the rest of your skincare.. In just 7 days I've noticed some improvement already and I'm really looking forward to seeing longer term results..

The pump works perfectly, too. The brand suggests warming 2-3 pumps in your palms, then bringing your hands to your face and taking a deep breath to fully enjoy the beautiful herbal scent. That’s exactly what I do, and it feels like a mini spa moment. It adds a calming, relaxing touch to my skincare routine, sometimes, it’s nice to just slow down and enjoy the moment! As I mentioned earlier the scent is gorgeous, herbal and earthy, not overwhelming and it fades away quickly. Now, let’s talk about the results, This serum really boosts the effectiveness of my other skincare products. I apply it before my milky toner, and the results are so beautiful that I often feel like I don’t even need a moisturizer afterward. It Leaves my skin soft, hydrated and looking healthy, no more dry patches. Best part, I have acne prone skin and it didn’t break me out. I am so happy I got to discover such an amazing product, I am excited to see the long term results and I would recommend to everyone to include it in their skincare routine !"

My face looks radiant with a natural glow, without any greasy feel. I have always struggled with extremely dry skin, so it’s difficult to find products that genuinely work and provide lasting hydration. What I particularly like about this serum is its lightweight texture and how easily it applies evenly without leaving any sticky residue. I also appreciate that the herbal fragrance is subtle although I usually prefer fragrance-free products, this one doesn’t bother me at all. The serum absorbs quickly, leaving a calming and deeply hydrated sensation on the skin. With each use, I notice my face becoming softer and looking healthier. This product has definitely improved the appearance and condition of my skin, and I’m pleasantly surprised by its effectiveness.   This review was collected as part of a promotion"

There is that recognizable smell of a clean floral and herb combo that you get at spas in the waiting area and with a good facial.  The consistency is just barely thicker than a liquid so that it doesn’t run all over, but it absorbs quickly.  I do feel like my products to follow absorb more easily when I use this first.  The vitamin C in it seems to be brightening my skin, and my skin barrier with this is impeccable.  The air in the cold months has become extremely dry, but my skin is perfectly hydrated using this. I am 47 and wrinkles are not easy to banish, so I don’t think this product can accomplish that, but the brightness, firmness and hydration it gives my skin are excellent.

From this serum’s refreshing, Ginger scent to its superpowered humectant abilities, after only seven days of testing it out I practically wanted to bathe in it every day. The struggle was real not to OVERUSE this potent skincare.   I live in the Pacific Northwest, where humidity in the fall is super high.  This serums humectant ability worked seamlessly with this dense humidity by making my skin feel fresh and hydrated all day long. I even noticed that when I used this serum all by itself, my skin still felt comfortable and dewy. When I layered on other serums and moisturizers, my 42-year-old dry skin felt supremely plump and hydrated.   I also suffer from dry eczema spots on my hands and feet and after feeling just how hydrating this serum can be I thought I would test it on those spots. I was pleasantly surprised at how the dry spots on my skin felt less irritated and less reactive.

No matter, because now that I've found it, I'm not letting go!  The bottle itself is gorgeous, yet simple. The serum itself feels more like what you'd get in an ampule.  It's very thin, and not oily at all, just light and watery feeling.  It feels great on freshly cleansed skin, giving a feeling of instant hydration and energy.  It can be used am and pm, but I love using it again just prior to makeup or primer (it doesn't interfere at all).  Being slightly acne-prone, with aging skin , I'm impressed to see zero breakouts or congestion. What I do see is bouncy, supple skin that finally looks awake!  It helped with fine lines and uneven skin texture as well. My skin feels unbelievably smooth now that I've been using it regularly.

This post-cleanse (yes, you apply this right after cleansing, not after toner, etc.) boosting serum is viscous and has a beautiful auburn color. It has a pleasant hanbang scent. It does contain fragrance, which I am generally not a fan, but this scent is quite spa-like.  This product is sold every 10 seconds and is now in its 6th generation.  I have used this product a few times over the years.  Frankly, I can’t differentiate this version from the last, but I do know this product works to boost my skin condition.

After a week of using it both morning and night, I could feel and see a bit of difference in my skin.  My complexion appeared brighter, plumper, and felt deeply nourished—almost like it had a protective shield against daily stressors.  The texture is lightweight and absorbs quickly, making it perfect for layering with other products. Plus, the subtle herbal scent adds a soothing, spa-like feel to my routine.  One of the things I like the most is how well it prepares the skin for the rest of my skincare steps. It’s almost as if my other serums and moisturizers absorb better when I use this as my base layer. It’s a bit of a splurge, but if you’re looking to invest in a product that delivers real, visible results, Sulwhasoo First Care Activating Serum is definitely worth considering!"

I find the serum to be very unique because it's used as a first step right after cleansing the face and before toner. One pump is all I need to cover my face. The texture is so elegant with a thin gel like consistency. I love the scent so much. It's very herbal and fresh. It is not greasy at all and does not leave a residue on my skin. I can see why this unique serum is so popular as I started seeing a new glow to my skin after I started using it. My skin feels very hydrated and protected and is starting to look more youthful. I have a new radiance, and I can feel my other products being absorbed better since I started using it. This one is a keeper.  *This review was collected as part of a promotion"

This is important to me because I am often wary of product interactions when layering. I enjoy the smell of the Sulwhasoo serum- it truly is herbal and spa-like. It is relaxing, and I do recommend to apply it as a ‘ritual’ as they instruct. It leaves my skin feeling smooth, clean and matte. It’s not in the least bit drying, sticky, greasy, or even dewy. My skin just looks and feels like naturally healthy skin. My skin feels soooo good after applying this.

The packaging is sleek and minimalistic, with a solid, high-quality feel that reflects Sulwhasoo’s luxury branding. The bottle itself is sturdy, and the pump dispenser makes it easy to control the amount I use. I’ve come to appreciate these small design details, as it keeps me from accidentally dispensing too much, which is a relief since this serum is on the pricier side. Right away, the experience felt high-end and well-thought-out, which is nice when I’m spending extra on skincare. When I first pumped the serum into my hand, I immediately noticed its amber tint and lightweight, almost watery texture. It spreads easily, and a little goes a long way. The scent is probably the most distinct aspect of this product—strong, herbal, and reminiscent of traditional Korean medicinal herbs, like ginseng. Initially, I was unsure if I’d like it because it’s quite potent, but I quickly grew to love it. The scent gives the experience a grounding, almost therapeutic feeling, and it reminds me that this product is packed with natural, herbal ingredients. Overall, the serum is surreal to be this good."

In fact, after my first few applications, I still didn't have much to rave about.  Like many serums with a similar appearance, consistency, and feel, I expected hydration amd a small amount of line diminishment as a result of skin plumping ingredients in the First Care serum.  What I began to notice after around 3 days of use, was my skin's brightness, overall more even tone, soft and sppleness together with a resiliency I hadn't noticed in years.

While I did not break out at all from adding a new product I also noticed immediate results in the first week. My skin appeared brighter, and smoother. I also noticed the wrinkles on my forehead looked less apparent compared to what I had been noticing more and more as I get older. Being in my early thirties makes things more noticeable then they were a few years ago. The serum did not really have a smell to it and I really appreciated that along with the fact that it absorbed rather well and quickly. This is a easy to use solution for anyone trying to combat the continuous struggle of age prevention in skin.

It spreads and melts into my skin like butter without causing me irritation or leaving a sticky/greasy residue behind.   It deeply fills my skin dry, dull skin up with hydration while locking in moisture and strengthening my barrier, which gives my complexion a refreshed and radiant appearance. It soothes inflammation and leaves my skin velvety soft while also plumping and firming it, which makes my fine lines and wrinkles appear more open and less prominent. It also brightens and refines my skins texture and tone while giving me a very youthful and healthy glow.   I love how gentle yet powerful this serum is at improving signs of aging. It has helped so much with keeping my skin hydrated, improving my elasticity, and keeping my skin barrier strong while also leaving my complexion with the most rejuvenated and youthful glow that is so long-lasting.

The fragrance is lovely and botanical, as it is meant to awaken the senses, and prepare you for a truly spa like experience.

But it was when I applied the rest of my skincare that I saw the biggest difference. I was blown away by how effortlessly my next serum applied to my skin. The serum i regularly use normally takes some time to soak into my skin and sits on top of it for a while. But this time it absorbed right into my skin! The same thing happened with my nighttime moisturizer. But the best part was how amazing my skin looked in the morning. It had a beautiful glow and was so soft. I’ve been using it every night for the last week and I can’t wait to see the improvement with continued use."

This is my first time using the Sulwhasoo brand and I’m beyond impressed my skin immediately soaked this in and felt hydrated, my fine lines softened and this definitely added a brightness to my complexion.  I’m also obsessed with how my makeup looks when I use this as a first step in my morning beauty routine. Everything seems to blend perfectly and stays fresh longer. I will definitely keep this one in my morning routine and highly recommend especially for anyone who struggles with dry skin."

It doesn’t feel greasy or shiny. It has beautiful aroma of botanicals which I loved. I applied in morning right after washing my face as per directions. It is gentle on my skin. My skin was irritated for last few days and I have stopped using actives to heal it. I tried this serum and it was gentle on my skin as I had no irritation.

My skin looks so much healthier, and plump as well as hydrated. I can see the difference already in my skins elasticity as well!

The pump is another plus, dispensing the perfect amount with no mess, which I much prefer over a traditional dropper. One of the standout features is the value of this serum.

The serum absorbs really fast into the skin, so you can wear it under makeup or layer with other skincare products in your nighttime routine! There was no irritation, it was very gentle on my skin, but also extremely hydrating and did not cause me to produce extra oil, which is usually an issue with serums, they make me extra greasy throughout the day.  I've been using this for 2 weeks and noticed my skin has had no dry patchy areas like it used to, it feels so much more plump and radiant, which has really created the illusion of younger looking skin which I  LOVE! I plan to keep using this, and cannot wait to see what my skin looks like after the entire bottle is empty! And a little goes a long way, so it will last a long time, which makes it much more worth the money! The scent almost smells like a fancy kitchen cleaner, but not in a off-putting way, just smells clean. *This review was collected as part of a promotion"

I’m in my mid-30’s (ugh I can’t believe I’m saying that!!) and need as much help as I can get with fighting signs of aging. This serum is incredibly lightweight and smells fresh, clean and refreshing. One of my favorite things about this specific serum is that it’s lightweight and easy to absorb into the skin, which allows you to easily incorporate other products into your skincare routine with it. When I apply this (morning and night) my skin looks incredibly plump and glowy in the morning. Highly recommend this product!"

It has a very spa like scent, earthy and herbal smelling. Perhaps Hinoki? I use 1-2 pumps in the morning and in the evening for hydrated, plump, and silky smooth skin all day and night. Some might consider it a bit pricey however I personally find it well worth the price. The bottle is glass and looks beautiful on your bathroom vanity as well. As I said I use 1-2 pumps with usually only 1 in the morning and 2 in the evening to sort of marinate my skin for perfectly beautiful skin ready for the next day!! Highly recommend!"

As I use this product, I only use 3-4 drops onto my skin. You can use as much needed. As I applied to my skin, I notices how much my skin was needed of moisture, the serum just filled my skin with moisture, as a barrier to keep my skin moisturized I'm within a period of time, and that period of time is until my nighttime skincare routine.    My results in using this product is wonder works to my skin. My skin is more moisturized, hydrated, softer, my deep wrinkles are slightly opening up and getting plumpped, as my slight wrinkles are looking more rejuvenating. My skin looks radiant with a glow.

I do think it makes my skincare absorb faster and it definitely gives my skin a nice, natural glow. I suspect that over time it will diminish the fine lines that have appeared on my forehead in recent years! I also personally really like the smell. It reminds me of skincare products they use in spas (earthy and natural). However, it is on the stronger side and if earthy and natural scents aren’t to you, it might smell like high end bug spray!

Orange is one of my favorite colors, and I appreciated the sleek, cream-colored bottle design. The pump dispenser was easy to use, and three pumps were just the right amount to cover my face.  The serum has a natural, subtle scent...not too floral, which I really liked. It soaked into my skin quickly, leaving no tackiness, and felt like it provided a nice boost of hydration, though I found that I still needed to follow up with a moisturizer, especially since I live in Arizona, where the heat can be unforgiving. For me, the serum feels more like a targeted treatment than a stand-alone moisturizer, which fits perfectly into my three-step routine: serum, moisturizer, and eye cream.  I keep the bottle on my bathroom counter and prefer to use it in the evenings. The natural scent feels calming, almost like an essential oil, making it an ideal part of my nighttime routine. While the bottle is too large to throw into my gym bag, I enjoy having it at home as part of a consistent routine. The product’s performance is exceptional, and I’m happy with how efficiently it absorbs and leaves my skin feeling refreshed. It’s a solid treatment that I can easily see myself using long-term.

The serum is a peachy colored lightweight gel consistency that glides on the the skin, absorbing almost immediately.  Usually I start my routine with a toner but with this serum you apply it directly after cleansing to help the absorption of other products.  The scent is light, herbal, and kind of woodsy.  The only ding, so to speak, is the added fragrance as some people are very sensitive to fragrance.  I really like the way this serum absorbs and doesn't leave any sort of film.  It does not pill with other products or makeup.  I notice after about a week of use my skin is more hydrated and glowing.

My skin immediately looks more glowy and hydrated due to the support of the water and oil balance. The texture is silky smooth with a consistency between liquid and lotion.   I find that it is best applied by patting it into my face and gently massaging into my skin. This serum is meant to support the absorption of the other products that follow. It is a light brown color with a slight herbal scent. It comes housed in a cream colored bottle with a good weight to it. The pump mechanism that dispenses product allows you to customize your amount. I like to use about two pumps across my face and neck. It absorbs quickly into my skin. I think this serum would be a great addition for all skin types, especially those who are looking to boost hydration, improve firmness, and enhance radiance. I’m looking forward to increased benefits, such as improvement in fine lines and elasticity, over time.

I’ve got fine lines that seem to pop up overnight like unwanted guests, and let's not even get started on the general dullness. This serum made me feel like I upgraded my skin-care routine from amateur hour to luxury spa status.   First of all, I love that this is my first step after cleansing. The texture is light and silky, like my skin was getting a VIP treatment. The instructions said to apply three pumps and press it into damp skin—so I did, and wow! It didn’t just sit there awkwardly; it soaked in like it was on a mission to hydrate my soul. The ginseng and Korean herbs make me feel like I’m treating my face to some kind of ancient beauty ritual.   Now, don’t expect miracles overnight, but after a week, my skin went from dry desert to hydrated oasis. The fine lines? They didn’t vanish into thin air (I’m not a wizard), but they’ve definitely softened, like they’ve decided to chill out. My face is smoother, and there’s a noticeable bounce that wasn’t there before, like my skin’s had a pep talk.  The real kicker, though? The scent. It smells like you’ve just wandered into an upscale spa—this light, herbal fragrance that makes me feel like I’m doing something truly luxurious for myself. No overpowering perfume here, just enough to make me think, 'Yeah, I deserve this.'  Bonus points: my other skincare seems to absorb better now, so I feel like I’m getting more bang for my buck with everything.  If you have dry skin like me and are battling the fine line army, give this a go! This serum might just be your new skincare BFF. Sulwhasoo, you have earned a permanent spot on my vanity."

I have found that a lot of serums are sticky or oily. This serum is lightweight and smells amazing! It is very energizing and invigorating for the skin. I use it in the mornings after I wake up. You only need 2-3 pumps of serum.  It is very hydrating and absorbs quickly. It is not sticky or oily. This serum helps even skin tone and gives you a healtht, radiant glow! I love the way it makes my skin look and I no longer wear foundation. I use a little concealer over this and my skin looks and feels amazing and healthy! I have been using this for a week and I love it! This is the best serum i have tried. I feel this would be great for any skin type but I would recommend to spot test if you have sensitive skin, as it is scented. I would highly recommend this serum and I would definitely purchase this again.   *I received this product for a promotional review. This is my honest feedback of this product."

I discovered the brand a year ago after watching a few TikTok videos on some of their other products and I was definitely influenced for the better because once I finally got my hands on a bottle of my own Sulwhasoo I was HOOKED. This is my favorite brand above all others! Sulwhasoo First Care Activating Serum is one of my favorite products Sulwhasoo has to offer! I put it on directly after cleansing so that I ensure that all of the products that I apply afterwards fully get absorbed deep into my skin as this products helps all of that go smoothly! And believe me it works because as soon as I stop applying this product when I forget or run out I can see a very distinct difference in my skin and how my other products are reacting without it. Seems like nothing fully gets absorbed and just sits on top of my skin. I hate that! I highly recommend this product to anyone and everyone who uses skincare. Without it is like eating soup without a spoon. You need that delivery system! You will not regret it!  *This review was collected as part of a promotion."

Well, I  can say wholeheartedly that this has been an absolutely soul soothing, skin loving, earthy experience from the moment I  pressed that first pump, until now. I fell so in love with this ultra lightweight yet powerful serum. My skin is accustomed to the more sticky serums, and more spreadable, if you will. Even though this is different, this did not disappoint! Upon my first use, the scent wrapped me in a super lightweight cloud of herbal and almost citrusy type of scent. It is very organic, yet without any strange smells. I instantly felt this thin veil of moisture, which absorbed very quickly, but, 2 pumps was the perfect amount for my face and neck area, so spreadability wasn't really a factor. My skin felt immediately refreshed and hydrated. I use this at night and in the morning with my extensive routine. Then I realized- when I use this, I  didn't need so many other products. I could use just this under my moisturizing cream in the A.M.  That is such a strange yet wonderful change for me! My skin feels tighter in a good way, hydrated, and ny fine lines are less noticeable. My makeup applies beautifully over this! I am very happy with this serum, and can absolutely see myself replacing other products with this. I absolutely recommend this if you want an effective yet superior lightweight serum! It does not clog my pores either."

I gave it a try and was so happy that I did. This really did seem to amplify my skincare routine. I did add to both my morning and evening routine. I was a little unclear if I should do this before or after toning, but I did ultimately end up using it after. The product itself feels very luxurious—like something that would be applied during a facial. It is soothing and lightweight. It does have a kind of dishwasher soapy smell to it—I also own a Sulwhasoo cleanser and it smells exactly the same. Wasn’t unbearable, just not my favorite scent. I have dry skin with uneven texture and I felt like this was a good product to address both issues. I am glad I incorporated this into my routine!"

It's not one of those that sits around waiting to be absorbed. I noticed a brightening effect within just a couple of days (especially when used before Snowise Brightening Water and Serum) and also a slight reduction in my skins' oil production - something I was not expecting. But I must mention the reduction is only slight, not huge and I still need to use blotting sheets by late afternoon time.   There's some really good 'herbal' ingredients in First Care Activating Serum, and unfortunately some really bad ones too. How's 'alcohol' for you, at second position on the ingredients list? Not to mention a ton of fragrance. Luckily I didn't experience any irritation or breakout, but I'm not confident I'd be saying the same thing if I was to use this long term. It's a shame, this product holds a lot of potential, with just a couple of minor adjustments to the ingredients it could be something truly special.

It absorbs pretty quickly into the skin but my guess is that could be due to the higher levels of alcohol denat/denatured alcohol. Because of how drying this ingredient can be for the skin barrier I’m not sure I could use this very often. I don’t mind this ingredient if it’s not listed within the first 7 ingredients of a product, but this is the second ingredient listed which likely means there are higher levels of it. This being said, I have not noticed skin sensitivity after use so I do feel like it is safe to use a few times a week. There is a scent but I don’t mind it. This serum contains ginseng which I love ! I do feel like my skin is less dull and more plump after use. I also like the minimalist / gender neutral packaging !"

As with the prior gen, I feel that my skincare is absorbing better when I start my routine with this serum. Finally, I am happy to report that I quickly saw results in terms of barrier boosting! My experience with ginseng/hanbang is that the full results will come in several weeks.  My final notes: Sulwhasoo is a brand wherein it is difficult to look at the INCI and conclusively state, oh it's THIS ingredient that is leading to these results! Instead, I believe this brand's entire formulas are responsible for the results. For this same reason, I don't believe it is helpful to write this off due to the fragrance/alcohol. Alcohol can be formulated into a gentle product, and fragrance can enhance the user experience. Overall, I think this brand and this product are formulated with great care for excellent results."

			"review_text": "I love when products deliver a beautiful usage experience, and this Sulwhasoo First Care Activating Serum absolutely hit the spot. From the beautiful bottle to the grounding herbal medicine scent to the water-like texture, it’s a joy to use.  The scent is truly calming for me, breathing it in as part of my evening routine is a wonderful way to end the day. It’s very herbaceous and reminds me of an essential oil blend. On the bright side, the scent does dissipate quickly as the product melts into the skin.  The golden elixir is lightweight and runny; it melts quickly into the skin, dries to the touch within minutes, and leaves zero residue behind, which is a huge win. The brand recommends warming two to three pumps of the serum in your hands and gently pressing it into your cheeks, forehead, and nose until absorbed. It has a light texture and is almost like water, with an amber color.  It seems contradictory that adding an extra layer of skincare would help subsequent layers absorb better, but it works. My toner and serums seem to absorb quicker and leave less of a film when I use the Sulwhasoo activating serum. This was slightly harder to notice, but I’ve noticed that the rest of my products work harder when I use the Sulwhasoo serum.  My skin just feels more moisturized and has a bit more glow when I use this. I didn’t notice a difference in fine lines either way though. So if you’re in your 20’s, as I was when I first tried the Sulwhasoo Activating Serum, you’re going to be disappointed. But as we get older and our skin gets drier, duller, and more fine lines, this product can be just the boost your skincare routine needs.  Gifted by Sulwhasoo."

Normally, nothing else works for me. If you tried every other eczema product at the lower price range, definitely pick up this and the emulsion. The creams prescribed by doctors hurt my sensitive eyes and above lip area so much that I couldn't keep using it. Sulwhasoo is extremely gentle yet so incredibly effective. After spending hundreds trying so many eczema targeted products, this is the one that is working for me. Also fine a face wash to do double cleansing. This will help flake off all the hard painful skin. I can't say enough about how my face looks so much better and most importantly, little to no daily pain."

All I know is this confirms how high up the parfum is listed matters - no matter how expensive or good the other ingredients may be. For reference, I am topically allergic to lavender and react badly to essential oil/ natural fragrance - but parfum low on ingredient lists do not pose an issue for me. So it was not expected until experiencing this that the concentration of parfum would be the reacting factor.

It’s sad that other Sulwhasoo products like the “Concentrated Ginseng Renewal Cream” and “Overnight Revitalization Mask” have fantastic ingredients and yield great results, their poster child “First Care Activation Serum”, couldn’t be bothered to find better ingredients/technology to replace alcohol denat… please do better, as a huge brand under Amorepacific, you have BILLIONS of dollars under your belt to do more researches, this is just sad and disappointing"

I don't think it's necessarily a must-have but if you have the extra cash for both the experience and a product that does make a marginal difference in your skin's quality, this is the one.  It's my understanding that this serum helps soften the skin (this is also what this line's toner does) which increases the absorption of whatever other products you use. I cleanse, use a toner from another Korean brand, apply this serum then my vit c serum and so on. I can't speak to the anti-aging benefits and I also don't have any special circumstances when it comes to my skin (I'm not using tret and I have no acne or anything).  Like I said, it's not life-changing but I can definitely feel a difference when I don't use it. That much, I can say for sure."

After applying to clean skin, I was itchy almost immediately and blotchy with raised red bumps within moments. Apart from how this was a no go for my skin specifically, I wouldn’t have recommended it based on fragrance (earthy strange), texture (sticky tacky), consistency (didn’t spread evenly), and price ($$$).

The scent is a bit woody/earthy but I like that slightly groovy, natural smell and it dissipated quickly. This is a wonderful serum to add to your daily routine!"

I’d definitely recommend them to someone who needs to firm up their skin and doesn’t have a problem with their skin drying out easily.

To be honest I had never heard of this brand until recently when Influenster let me know that I was going to be receiving these products but I am super happy that I did. The brand itself seems very high quality and almost luxurious in a sense. This serum feels like a special treat and I am so happy I got this. The consistency and texture of this serum felt great on my fingers and was super easy to apply to my face and skin. I was able to tell after putting it on that it made my skin feel softer to the touch which is a big plus of this product. The packaging is simple but beautiful and this brand I can tell is worth the money. What was also nice about this serum is that it wasn’t tacky like other serums have been that I have tried in the past. I know that this brand is a little more on the pricy side but I can tell why they charge what they do. Their products are high quality and make my skin noticeablely softer and it does what it is supposed to do!"
