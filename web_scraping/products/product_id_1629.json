I feel like a lot of the reviews saying it pills don’t realize it’s just a mask not a moisturizer substitute, you’re supposed to wash it off. Both times I’ve applied it to damp skin and lightly patted more water on after about 10 mins, let it sit for 20-30 then wash it off. I will say it definitely makes my skin feel super soft and moisturized BUT for some reason both times the next morning when I woke up my eyelids were burning. I’m not sure if it’s something in my eye cream that I applied after or what but I don’t love it."

After a single night with this mask, my face is glowing and super hydrated. I sleep with it on, and use it as a regular moisturizer. Only downside is the cost, and it would be nice if they had bigger sizes."

Topicals also released the Like Butter Moisturizer, which is absolutely amazing for my sensitive skin and is great for regular use! I started using the moisturizer on my hands as that's where I get eczema when I'm stressed, and since I left the cream in the bathroom, my husband started using it as a moisturizer. After some time I wondered how his skin was looking so moisturized, as he rarely uses skincare during the spring/summer time because he hates to look 'oily'. Come to find out he's been using Like Butter as his moisturizer and loved that it didn't leave him shiny! We both love that the product doesn't have a smell either, and it absorbs so fast that it's great for me to use on my hands, and for him since he doesn't like products that sit on his skin - 10/10 from both of us!"

It wasn't a miracle-over-night product for me so it did take a few weeks for noticeable dying down of flare ups, but it did help!  A little issue is the packaging sometimes pools excess product if it gets bumped around in my bag and a bunch of product comes out all at once, I just end up using it the excess anyway.

It dries off on the face after leaving it on for ~5 mins even with a very thick layer. I don't like it. Nothing special at all. It would pill if used with a thin layer. I do not get why this product has such high reviews. I would leave one star and not zero since there are not any adverse effects besides pilling. It does not seem to irritate or cause any breakouts on my skin. Also, I do not have very sensitive skin."

			"review_text": "I am in love! As someone with dry, sensitive skin, finding a moisturizer that truly nourishes and hydrates without irritating my skin can be a challenge, but this product has exceeded my expectations. From the moment I applied the moisturizer, I could feel its creamy, rich texture sinking deeply into my skin, providing long-lasting hydration that lasted throughout the day. Despite its thick consistency, it absorbed quickly and did not leave any greasy residue behind, which is a huge plus. The natural ingredients in this moisturizer are impressive - shea butter, mango butter, jojoba oil, and colloidal oatmeal are just a few of the nourishing ingredients that make up this formula. I appreciate that it is specifically formulated to soothe and heal irritated skin, making it a great choice for those with eczema or other skin concerns. What I love most about this moisturizer is how it has improved the overall texture and appearance of my skin. My complexion is more even, and my skin looks brighter and more hydrated than ever before. The packaging is also convenient and easy to use, with a pump dispenser that makes it simple to control the amount of product you use. Overall, I would highly recommend the Topicals Like Butter Moisturizer to anyone looking for a deeply nourishing and hydrating moisturizer that is specifically formulated for dry, sensitive, or eczema-prone skin. It has truly transformed my skin, and I can't imagine going back to any other moisturizer!"

I've been patting it on dry areas after my other skincare, and even reapplying during the day if necessary. It has helped so much with the flaking and scaling! I don't think I was initially the right user for this product, but I would recommend it to anyone who is experiencing retinization and needs to restore their skin barrier. It absorbs quickly and feels light. I don't really wear makeup but I can anticipate that it pills."

I have bad eczema around my eyes, so bad that I wear Vaseline even in the morning and am constantly reapplying. Almost every time I’ve used this mask, it has slightly stung my eyes while applying it, and my skin just doesn’t feel super hydrated after rinsing it off. I think I was hoping this would be similar to the I’m From honey mask, but it is much thinner and did not feel as sensorially pleasant. I was kind of left wondering where the product went when I put it on?? I think since it’s a wash off mask I expected it to sit on top of my skin a bit more rather than completely absorb, but maybe I’m just THAT dry. I’ve found that this product works better on my hands, or as one of the three layers of moisturizer I’ll do after washing my face (I told you I was dry!). I still think this would be a great product for people with oily dehydrated skin, or just people without eczema, but for myself I probably won’t repurchase this."

What I don’t like though is that the consistency is a bit thick even though the claims say it is a lightweight cream.

It says to apply on a dry clean face, but I recommend using a hydrating toner before applying like butter, or you can apply on slightly damp skin. It's a bit strange to spread on dry skin, and can cause flakiness too depending on how much you use. It will also cause piling during your skincare routine if it doesn't absorb properly. You can use it as a moisturizer or mask, I recommend doing both as I do. Every night I double cleanse, then apply like butter, then shower, then do my skincare routine. Some nights I keep it on for over 20 min, sometimes I just immediately get in the shower. Softly/gently rub off at the end of your shower, then do your skincare routine. You can also apply as a lip mask as well before your shower or overnight. Like butter has made my skin texture alone much softer and healthier. Combined with using their other product faded which targets hyperpigmentation, my skin has become completely clear and soft"

I have tried so many different ones (SF, YTTP, etc) and nothing has compared to this mask.   It as a light scent, unidentifiable for me. A little goes a long way, and it goes on so nicely. It's not super thick, but it locks in moisture so well and doesn't break me out (huge plus). I put this on overtop of my serum/actives in the evening and in the morning my skin is so smooth and hydrated even after i wash my face in the morning! My one complaint would be the price, i wish it were a little cheaper, but i will definitely continue to buy this regardless!  HIGHLY recommend. This is a new staple in my winter skincare routine!!!"
