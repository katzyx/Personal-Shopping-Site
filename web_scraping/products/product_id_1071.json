	"how_to_use": "Suggested Usage:.-Fragrance is intensified by the warmth of your own body. Apply in the creases of your knees and elbows for a longer-lasting, stronger scent.&nbsp;.-After applying, avoid rubbing or dabbing skin. This breaks down the fragrance, causing it to wear off more quickly.&nbsp;.-If you prefer placing fragrance on your wrists, be sure to reapply after frequent hand-washing, as this tends to rinse off the scent.&nbsp;.-Replace fragrance after 12 months. Expired perfumes more than a year old lose the integrity of the original scent...Eau de Toilette or Eau de Parfum?: .The difference lies in the volume of perfume oil. While EDT contains five to nine percent, EDP contains more, usually eight to 14 percent. EDPs, therefore, last longer and smell more intense.",

Fruity, flowery but also not real overpowering smelling. The scent does last awhile but not all day. I was kinda disappointed with how small the bottles actually are but other than that I enjoyed this product."

			"review_text": "The Daisy Wild fragrance is a fruity floral scent and is described as a vibrant and feminine blend of jasmine, vertiver, and notes of banana blossom, never seen before in prestige perfumery. The smell is incredibly  sweet and gives an intensely appealing punch to the senses. In comparison, the Daisy Marc Jacobs fragrance which is also a fruity floral scent, is infused with succulent wild berries and soft white violets. This layerable fragrance has key notes of strawberry, violet leaves and jasmine. While the smell is not as intense as the Daisy Wild fragrance, it is also sweet and very feminine. I also love the cute tiny bottles the fragrance comes in, but I wish they had a spray component."

			"review_text": "I used this product for a couple days. I love the bottles with the Daisey on top. The scent is sore faint you can barely smell it. Does not last all day. I personally would not buy it because I like my Parfums to have a stronger scent and stay on all day."
