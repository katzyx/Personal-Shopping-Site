It contains resveratrol, a powerful antioxidant, vegan collagen, and hyaluronic acid. Product went on smooth and worked great under makeup or at night under moisturizer. There was a light fresh scent.  I did not find the scent to be overpowering. I really loved this serum, however after using it daily my skin became tight and I determined the product was too strong for my skin to use on a daily basis. Every other day or a couple of times of week is what my skin can handle."

It's not irritating on my very sensitive skin, a little bit goes a long way and it smells lovely (the fragrance is not overpowering or irritating). When applying this, my skin instantly feels plumped and hydrated. The next morning my skin feels soft and my redness is definitely reduced. Over time, I have noticed an improvement in the overall brightness of my skin as well, since I struggle with dullness and texture. I love this stuff. For me, it's totally worth the price."

On day 2 I noticed slight redness on my cheeks. I thought maybe it was a sun burn. This morning (day 3) I’ve woken up with more redness on my cheeks and lots of swelling. I see fine lines in my under eye area and my skin feeling tight and dry. This is unusual for me. With the high price point and so many terrific reviews I am very disappointed. One thing I want to mention is that I LOVED the scent. It is very calming and beautiful, however other than that unfortunately I don’t have anything good to say.  I would love to know other recommendations or alternatives to this serum as well, I’d like to make a return/exchange since I can no longer use this."

Excited by the claims of the Caudalie Resveratrol Lift Instant Firming Retinol Alternative Serum, I decided to give it a try. However, I must say that I was left a bit disappointed with the results on my skin.  Firstly, I appreciate the brand's commitment to using natural and sustainable ingredients. Caudalie's focus on utilizing resveratrol and hyaluronic acid as an alternative to retinol is definitely noteworthy. It's always reassuring to know that the products I'm using are carefully formulated with my skin's health in mind.  That being said, I didn't see any significant improvement in my skin after using this serum. Despite diligently incorporating it into my skincare routine, I didn't notice any visible firming or lifting effects. I was hoping for more noticeable results in terms of minimizing fine lines and improving overall skin texture. While the texture of the serum itself is lightweight and quickly absorbs into the skin, I personally felt that it left my skin feeling slightly dry after application. I would recommend ensuring that proper hydration is maintained before and after using this product to prevent any potential dryness."

I can't yet vouch for it longer term, but it my several weeks of use, my skin hasn't been irritated or dry. Quite the opposite, it fact. Even without a moisturizer, my skin felt soft and smooth, probably a benefit of the hyaluronic acid. I do notice some improvement in firmness, as well.  My one semi-complaint is the fragrance, which is pleasant but quite noticeable. I sometimes worry about fragrance, especially on the face. This did not seem to cause any reaction so far."

It took a few weeks before I noticed any difference and with continued use my skin has never looked or felt better. My skin is so soft and it looks a lot more firm too. The fine lines, crow's feet and the bags under my eyes are not as prominent and my skin looks healthier. The serum glide's on without any greasy oily feeling, it smells sweet & refreshing and doesn't clash with the fragrance of my moisturizer.

This serum offers a luxurious experience with its lightweight texture that absorbs effortlessly into the skin. As someone who can’t use retinol - I really appreciate the use of retinol alternative, and after a few weeks of use every night, I do feel it provides visible firmness, and I've noticed some improvement in my skin's texture and elasticity. I don’t see any significant improvement with my fine lines yet, but will continue to use it to see the results. The serum's anti-aging benefits make it a standout in my regimen, offering a perfect balance between effectiveness and gentleness. The elegant packaging is a bonus, making it a delightful addition to my skincare arsenal.  I received this product for free from Topbox Marketing for testing and review purposes. #freeproduct"

For a clean product, it does have what I'd consider to be a little fragrant but it didn't affect my slighty sensitive skin. The scent is nice but can be a little overwhelming. The texture and formula felt smooth and silky. it sunk right into my skin with no problems of pilling or tackiness. I appreciate the pump top instead of a dropper but it seems weird there is no cap. I'm still not sure how to feel about that. I haven't noticed much of a difference but it's only been a few weeks and I don't have heavy wrinkles for it to be THAT noticeable, however, I am 27 and have started the anti-aging journey already. The color is cute as well as the glass packaging and overall, I'd recommend to try it if you have any of the concerns mentioned.

Overall, I had no negative reactions to the product, but I didn’t notice a meaningful improvement in the appearance of fine lines or firmness to justify the high price point.  The serum has a very watery consistency which I didn’t like, and it has a strong floral fragrance.  The scent doesn’t linger, but it’s so strong initially that it makes me nervous about what I’m putting on my skin.  That said, it doesn’t make my skin look shiny/oily, or create a greasy feel (a common problem I run into with serums), but I definitely have to add an additional moisturizer to actually make my skin feel hydrated—this serum doesn’t do that on its own despite its hyaluronic acid.  This isn’t a bad product, but I didn’t see enough of a positive impact to make the cost worthwhile."

Resveratrol as an ingredient also supports ingredients like peptides and Vitamin-C and makes them work better.   I definitely see a difference on the days I use it v/s the days I don't use it. I definitely feel some firmness and lift when I use it.   Remember to use a small amount. After applying it, I wait a bit to apply my moisturizer. Always remember to use sunscreen during the day!

I’d say it’s probably 5-6/10 in terms of how strong the scent is. It’s very herbal. Almost floral. As far as its consistency, it’s very fluid and lightweight. It sinks into the skin rather quickly and I’d say loses it’s outer feeling on the skin completely after about 15 minutes. But it soaks into the skin beautifully and feels quite nourishing. I have dry skin so for me this definitely felt a little plumping and soothing. Packaging is really nice. The frosted glass component feels very luxurious as does the locking pump. I love that detail.

It absorbs quickly and has reduced the bumps on my cheeks and does not leave my skin feeling oily or greasy. Highly recommend! #freeproduct"

I have dry, mature skin and tend to prefer oil based serums but I kept an open mind. I don't expect miracles. This serum did have a tightening effect when used consistently, which made me happy! I used it mornings and evenings. It has a very slight scent that is pleasant and fades away almost immediately. As an alternative to chemical ingredients I found it to be just as effective, with the exception of not quite moisturizing enough for my skin and I would layer it with an additional serum. Would I recommend it? Yes. Would I buy it? Maybe.  *I received this product for free from Topbox Marketing for testing and review purposes."

I love the light lemongrass scent from the cream, the smell is divine and I feel very relaxed by massaging my face with it. It contains patented resveratrol, hyaluronic acids, shea better along with vegan collage.This serum is lightweight, very easy to apply and I'm happy that my sensitive skin approved it. This serum aims to reduce fine lines and wrinkles on your face, I don't see the instant firming effect on me as I'm not at that age yet. As a hydrating serum it is really good, it absorbs immediately into my skin, softening and filling the skin with a delightful glow, I feel my skin become plumper and radiant.  I enjoy using this #freeproduct antioxidant instant firming retinol alternative serum, the quality is great compared to other serums in the market.

What I've noticed is it has made my skin really smooth and soft. Also all my chin acne has completely cleared up which was totally unexpected. I couldn't believe it. It's the only thing I've done differently so that alone makes this a 5 star product for me. As far as firming, I'm not totally sure. But it is highly nourishing, smoothing serum. I can also use this in place of moisturizer some days because have oily skin. So I love that also. It's a win for me."

The serum has a lightweight, silky texture that absorbs quickly into my skin without leaving any greasy residue.   It's a bit on the pricey side, but I think the results are worth it.  I'm very happy with the Caudalie Resveratrol Lift Instant Firming Retinol Alternative Serum and would recommend it to anyone looking for a product to help firm and smooth their skin.

I turned 40 this year and I have been sure to take care of my skin and I prefer products that are more natural, and this fits the bill. I look forward to continuing to use the Caudalie.

The best thing is my skin is more tight and firm leaving my wrinkles visibly less noticeable. I have used a lot of different and expensive serums, with and without retinol and never really noticed much difference in my fine lines and wrinkles, but this serum has been a holy grail!

The Caudalie Resveratrol-Lift Instant Firming Retinol Alternative Serum is one of those products. The serum is very lightweight, liquidy, smooth and creamy. It spreads easily, covers well, and absorbs quickly. I only need one pump of the serum to cover my whole face. I have also been using the serum on my neck and it's looking great. With daily use I have found that my skin feels a bit firmer and it is much softer and smoother. It has really helped my dry facial skin to become normalized. I no longer have a tight, dry feeling to my skin and it looks healthier. My fine lines are also minimized. I look forward to further improvements as I continue to use this serum. I have used retinol products before and had some problems with them being drying to my skin. The Caudalie Retinal Alternative Serum does not dry out my skin, but provides significant moisturization and improvement. The product itself is for all skin types, it contains vegan collagen, 98% of the ingredients are from natural origins and it is not tested on animals, which is important to me. It does not contain any parabens, thalates, silicones, PEG or animal products. The only negative that I have found is that the scent is not what I am used to and I do not really like this scent. It does not linger after drying, which is good. I definitely recommend the high quality products from Caudalie, and especially this Resveratrol-Lift Instant Firming Retinol Alternative Serum. While I did receive this product in exchange for use and a review, I am a dedicated Caudalie customer. #freeproduct"

During the winter time my skin can become too dry and not always tolerate retinol, particularly with prolonged use, so I was really excited to try some alternative. It was the first time I used resveratrol, this unique ingredient works like a powerful antioxidant and helps to reduce the look of wrinkles, to lift and firm the skin. Another important ingredients are vegan collagen and two molecular sizes of hyaluronic acid. I am glad 98% ingredients are natural and this is a vegan product, it has no parabens, phenoxyethanol, phtalates, huiles minerals, PEG and silicones. The packaging is very good quality matte glass bottle and the pump convenient to use, it is easy to get the exact amount of product needed. I also enjoyed the box with the picture of the french vineyards inside, the reference to the main ingredient.  I used the serum twice per day as part of my morning and night skincare routine during 3 weeks on my face and the area around my eyes right after cleansing and toning. I really liked the consistency of the serum, it is milky and creamy, very lightweight and easy to apply. Feels like a luxury high end product, it absorbs fast and leaves skin soft, smooth, hydrated and nourished. The formula is very gentle and never irritated my sensitive skin. It doesn’t peel under the makeup and helps to prevent the dryness during the day. I noticed it smoothed wrinkles, especially around eyes area, the serum also leaves a healthy radiant glow, firms and lifts face and neck. I also enjoyed the herbal scent, which helps me to relax, especially before the nighttime.   I am highly impressed with the results, the serum does exactly what it claims to do and I would definitely recommend it.  #freeproduct"

The serum is very light and spreads easily and absorbs quickly. During the first three days of use, I noticed that my face was slightly sticky for about 15-20 minutes or so but subsequent days, it was not sticky.  Additionally moisturizer was needed as the serum doesn’t moisturize the face or skin. I noticed a smoother face by day 5; more noticeable were my forehead, cheeks. I will recommend the Caudalie Resveratrol Lift Instant Firming Retinol Alternative Serum after using it continuously for 11-12 days. I believe a continuous use is necessary to see desired results."

I honestly believe if I keep going, it will all keep improving. The fragrance is very pleasant and relaxing, almost as if I'm at a spa. The texture is amazingly soothing, not too thick and not too runny. It seeps well into the skin and makes your face feel so soft AND it doesn't leave your skin greasy, sticky, or oily. It's the most perfect serum I've ever tried, no lie!  I received this product for free in exchange for my honest feedback. Not sure if I would have given it a chance at it's price point, but so glad I was able to test it because I will be purchasing a bottle soon as I get low!

What I love about this product is that although I didn't notice much of a difference in lift, other people did and mentioned it. Common questions were if I'd lost weight. I  haven't. Others see my face and neck shape as more slender. Personally, I noticed the smile lines around my eyes and mouth as well as the horizontal lines on my neck are no longer visible after use. I don't know if it's a permanent solution or as a result of adding Caudalie to my regular skincare routine. The compliments regarding my face and neck being more slender are a welcome surprise to me that I hope to observe myself with extended use. To date, my favorite compliment came from a gentleman who saw me with nothing except skincare and questioned my age. I plan on continuing the use of this product to observe if I experience further benefits."

A few seconds after applying, the fermented smell comes through anyway along with the perfume. I know part of it could be that my nose is extra sensitive right now, but it’s terrible.

It was so smooth - all of the tiny rough texture you sometimes get after using a new product was completely gone. And now that I’ve used it for close to a month I like it even more.  It’s not harsh on my skin, it’s actually cool and quite soothing. And it’s a great watery texture, so no slime from too many products or pilling makeup. I’m honestly really loving it!

It took me about 4 months to use up the bottle after slowly introducing into my routine first at night, then during the day as well over the course of a couple of weeks. This serum is a milky liquid that absorbs fairly quickly. It has a moderate herbal-earthy smell that seems similar to other Caudalie products I've tried. I like that you can adjust the amount of product delivered from the pump by twisting the nozzle. I used about one and a half pumps to cover my face, neck, & decolletage. My main gripe about the product overall is the pump opening. Product can gunk up and form a goopy booger in the opening, which either clogs the nozzle or gets dispensed with the next usage. Upon receiving this product, I hoped to target the areas where I am beginning to see the most wrinkles in my skin: horizontal lines across my forehead, Venus rings around my neck, and vertical wrinkles from my neck toward my decolletage. I definitely don't think this affected the wrinkles in my forehead, and I'm not sure about my Venus rings, but, anecdotally, I feel like I see slightly less pronounced wrinkles in my decolletage area. I think this serum might best be used to mitigate damage before it occurs."

I incorporated this serum into my nighttime skincare routine, applying it just before bedtime, and the results were impressive.  First and foremost, the scent of this product is delightful. It has a subtle, soothing fragrance that adds to the overall relaxation of my nighttime routine. It feels like a mini spa treatment before I drift off to sleep.  One of the standout features of this serum is its firming properties. Over time, I noticed that my skin appeared visibly firmer and more toned, which was particularly noticeable around my jawline and cheek area. It seems to have a lifting effect, and I wake up with a rejuvenated complexion.  What I appreciate most about this serum is that it absorbs quickly, leaving my skin feeling hydrated without any greasiness. It's also gentle on my sensitive skin, causing no irritation or breakouts.  In summary, the Caudalie Resveratrol-Lift Instant Firming Serum has become a favorite part of my nightly skincare routine. Its lovely scent, firming benefits, and overall effectiveness make it a product I wholeheartedly recommend to anyone looking to enhance their nighttime skincare regimen."

That way, I will be able to see how it ultimately works for me and estimate all the benefits of the whole product. I've been using it for a while but it is a pretty big bottle that will still last me a long time. So now I can review my first impressions. According to application tips, I've been applying it day and night before my cream. To start with, it is lightweight, it absorbs well and feels nice. It has barely any scent which I very much prefer in cosmetics that I use. And most importantly, many cosmetic products that I I've tried on my face leave my skin oily, shiny. It is a real problem for me because I can't tell if it will until I try it, and the result can be frustrating. I instantly loved that this one doesn't add any oil / shine. For me, it's #1 selling point. My skin is rather sensitive, and I don't have any negative effects from the serum, so I will definitely continue using it. I gave it 4 stars only because I am yet to see the full results of using it, and because of the price point. If in the end I will see any improvement of my skin, it's 5 stars, and then the price is good. :)"

The combination of resveratrol, hyaluronic acid and peptides in this serum have given me results that I can't believe. Both the packaging and ingredients in this serum are sustainable and clean so if that's a concern this product is one of the best out there. the packaging is elegant but simple.

The retinol alternative formula seems to work wonders without any of the usual irritation associated with retinol products.  In summary, my experience with the Caudalie Resveratrol Lift Instant Firming Retinol Alternative Serum has been exceptional. It's a product that not only delivers on its promises but also provides a sensory pleasure during application. I'm grateful for the opportunity to try it out as a #freeproduct, and I'm now considering making it a permanent fixture in my skincare routine. Highly recommended for those looking to improve their skin's elasticity and overall appearance."

What I really like it's not greasy or sticky. It doesn't clog my pores either.  It's a glass bottle with a pump which I like . It has resveratrol and hyaluronic  acid which helps plumps the skin. It's now a permanent addition to my skincare routine. It's a little pricey but for great skincare it's definitely worth it. If anyone is on the fence about getting this get it you won't be disappointed.  Thank you #Caudalie and #Topbox Circle for allowing me to try this. What a really nice serum."

The product is Reveratrol-Lift and it is an instant firming serum that takes very little time to begin showing these phenomenal noticeably positive results. It is made for all skin types to be used on the face, neck and decollete. Upon use, I liberally applied this innovative serum in both the morning and evening and in only a matter of days I   began to see visible differences! I was amazed! Plus, having a delightful fragrance was just a bonus! I have been a HUGE Caudalíe fan for quite some time now and it is all due to their products being extremely effective, fast working and highly compatible with hard to please skin. Not to mention how hard it is to accommodate as it is maturing every day. I definitely recommend Caudalíe's Reveratrol-Lift to those looking to quickly diminish their wrinkles and plump that skin UP shaving years....decades(even) within minimal time. I will continue to use this serum as it is now part of my personal morning and evening daily skincare routine. Reveratrol-Lift is the BEST age defying serum I have EVER used!

I guess I can see why some may like that but it's just too overpowering in this serum for me. As for the feel and application, I actually liked it. It's lightweight, moisturizing and doesn't leave a sticky layer or film on the skin. However, the results to me didn't really have any lift and not much firming either. I actually feel like I can see my pores more now. I can see why they say to pair this with their cream for better results because on its own it doesn't really do much, especially for the price."

With some moisturizer overtop, this is all I need to go about my day with soft, plumped, tight skin.  I know this is working like retinol for me all day long, though it is actually an alternative product that works twice as well and is 97 percent natural! To make this even more appealing, Caudalie uses recycled plastic and glass to package this beautiful potion bottle, and the outside packaging is also recyclable.  #freeproduct"

My skin is sensitive and mostly gets irritated by perfumes in skin care products but for this product I had no problems with the scent. Texture is quite good, easy to apply on face, non-greasy. I used product am/pm. I felt some differences in two weeks like my skin got smoother and firmer. I really hate when products come off of my face while putting other products on it, for this products I didn't have this problem thank god. I am not sure if this can be a retinol alternative but it worth to give it a try. And packaging is cute as always for caudalie."

This actually has been more effective over the last month. The results with daily use are like magic. Very rarely do products do what they claim but this actually firms skin. My skin looks younger, healthier, more resilient and vibrant. Hitting 30, the focus on skin care and preventive products is a must! This has really brightened my skin, and given it a youthful bouncy appearance. I have been using it consistently for these great results; but it really provides REAL RESULTS! The bottle itself is so pretty, looks luxurious, and is a good size that will last. A little goes a long way. The pump is effective and disperses the perfect amount. I love EVERYTHING about this firming serum; I can’t recommend it enough! #FreeProduct"

I could feel a slight tightening when first applied, but my skin didn't look supple and taut like other serums I have used in the past over the same time period. I do not really care for the formulation of this serum as it is runny and doest have a good consistency.

Firstly, I am not a fan of the scent, it smells like old flowers lol, but the fragrance fades quickly thankfully. With that being said, the serum itself is nice. It is water based and has a liquid, runny texture. It applied very nicely and my skin drank it up. I used it at night and in the morning. It paired very well with my daytime sunscreen and my nighttime moisturizer. It has no sticky or oily feel at all which I absolutely love. I have oily skin and hate oily serums/moisturizers and was so happy this was water-based. I have had no adverse reaction like I would with Retinol serums. This being Retinol free is a huge game changers in the anti-aging category of skincare. My fine lines are improving and my skin is more supple. I will definitely continue using this."

The serum's lightweight texture and quick absorption have been a saving grace for my dry skin. It glides on smoothly and leaves no greasy residue, which is a huge plus for daytime wear. From the very beginning, I noticed a welcome boost in hydration levels. The addition of resveratrol in the formula is certainly doing its job in promoting healthier skin. The antioxidant properties have contributed to an improved overall tone and texture. As for the firming aspect, I haven't seen significant changes in that regard just yet. However, I do understand that such effects might take a bit more time. Hopefully with continued use, the cumulative benefits of the serum will eventually lead to firmer skin."

It is a milky consistency that sinks into your skin very quickly and leaves you with a dewy glow. With continued use I have noticed my fine lines fading considerably, my skin feels firmer and has a healthy glow that I didn’t have before. I don’t particularly have sensitive skin but if I have dry patches I tend to not use much retinol because it causes my skin to peel. Caudalie uses Resveratrol which is much gentler and gave me the same results without the irritation to my already dry skin. It contains Hyaluronic Acid which is the holy grail of moisturizers. This is the first time I have used a skincare product containing Vegan Collagen but I think that is the ingredient that actually firmed my skin. I love the fact that it is in a gorgeous glass bottle with a pump that works every time. This is absolutely worth the cost. You literally only need 1-2 pumps to cover your face and neck area."

My skin has aged significantly during that time and is parched and crepey in appearance along with deeper lines developing.  Thanks to the two molecular sizes of hyaluronic acids there is an instant noticeable improvement in my skins appearance and feel. Their vegan collagen alternative has helped increase smoothness.  The texture of the serum is silky and absorbed quickly. This did not cause any piling when used with eye creams, facial oils and moisturizers.

Its fabulous. It goes on so easily, and absorbs almost immediately. The scent is light and lovely. The way it feels on my skin is unlike any other similar product.

I absolutely love it! I love how easily the product comes out of the bottle, the scent is fabulous, very light and pleasant and not overpowering at all...just the right amount of fragrance!!! I used this product twice daily, once in the morning and then again in the evening...in about a week I started to notice a change in the appearance of my skin, and I am over the moon for it!!! The biggest bonus of the product is how much of the ingredients are all natural or have a natural origin, in my experiences with similar products none of them come close to being able to claim that..none. All in all this is now my go-to for serums and will forever have its place in my facial care routine. Oh did I also mention that the packaging is fully recycled plastic and glass?? Wow!! #freeproduct"

This instant firming serum is part of their resveratrol - lift collection which features a patented formula containing hyaluronic acid, resveratrol, and vegan collagen alternative, claiming to visibly firm skin. The serum has a runny, milky consistency. Its thin and absorbs into the skin after a couple minutes. Its hydrating and super gentle, no stinging or peeling. The packaging is plastic pump with glass bottle which feels high quality but is heavy. I am not the biggest fan of the scent from this line. It isn't terribly unpleasant, but when combined with the cream, it lingers for an hour after application. I have been using this serum in combination with the day cream for a month, and my skin is so smooth and more plump/ hydrated looking, but I do not notice it diminishing my fine lines. I have acne prone skin and this hasn't caused me to break out. In my opinion, this serum is worth a try if you are looking to add preventative anti aging product to your routine. If you are looking for a gentle hydrating serum that contains anti-aging ingredients, this is a solid serum. While I really enjoyed using this product, I had slightly higher expectations at this price point, so I will not be repurchasing"

This luxurious and effective firming serum was no exception and has a light pleasant scent and feels silky when it glides onto the skin. Designed to firm and lift the skin while reducing the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles, this vegan serum is formulated with Caudalie's exclusively patented Retinol alternative. I've been using in addition to the Cashmere Firming Cream and have really loved the way these both make my skin look and feel. The serum has a lightweight, milky consistency and sinks into the skin very beautifully, it doesn't feel heavy or leave any sticky residue on the skin. I am in my mid-forties and am always looking for anti-aging products to help keep my skin looking its best and I've definitely seen some visible improvements when using this combo in my nighttime skin routine.

The serum has a milky consistency with a light herbal scent that I don't even notice after a few minutes. This vegan collagen alternative serum was really gentle on my skin. I used this product once in the morning and once at night for the last few weeks and my skin never broke out or had any adverse reactions. I liked the plumping effect and I feel that my pores appear a bit smaller. The serum was really hydrating and left my skin feeling soft and smooth. My only complaint is that I didn't see more noticeable results with my fine lines and wrinkles. I still have plenty of product left to continue to see results, but for the moment, I would give this serum 4 stars."

The one con I have listed is that I did experience pilling after applying the moisturizer over the serum. I admittedly do probably use an excessive amount of product, but it was worth noting. Aside from that, I love the light scent of this milky serum that my skin drinks right up, and I love that even the directions for use include the decollete which has been an area of major concern for me lately.

This instant firming serum is part of their resveratrol - lift collection which features a patented formula containing hyaluronic acid, resveratrol, and vegan collagen alternative, claiming to visibly firm skin. The serum has a runny, milky consistency. Its thin and absorbs into the skin after a couple minutes. Its hydrating and super gentle, no stinging or peeling. The packaging is plastic pump with glass bottle which feels high quality but is heavy. I am not the biggest fan of the scent from this line. It isn't terribly unpleasant, but when combined with the cream, it lingers for an hour after application. I have been using this serum in combination with the day cream for a month, and my skin is so smooth and more plump/ hydrated looking, but I do not notice it diminishing my fine lines. I have acne prone skin and this hasn't caused me to break out. In my opinion, this serum is worth a try if you are looking to add preventative anti aging product to your routine. If you are looking for a gentle hydrating serum that contains anti-aging ingredients, this is a solid serum. While I really enjoyed using this product, I had slightly higher expectations at this price point, so I will not be repurchasing."

It absorbs very well into the skin and brings luminosity to it as well, which is great since I can’t tolerate vitamin c at all.  The most surprising benefit I’ve noticed has been the improvement of my dark acne marks! They have lightened up almost entirely since adding this to my routine. I also have not experienced breakouts from this product.

This is clearly a high quality product. It's very light and it absorbs into the skin nicely. However, I did get some breakouts from this products. I tend to be on the combo/oilier side so that might be the issue. Overall, I like this product and will continue to try it in hopes that the breakout was a one off. #freeproduct #trywithtopbox"

Its almost a bit floral, but not at all over powering. The application process is easy and you can see from my photo that the serum is thick enough without being chunky. The serum absorbs quickly and leaves my skin smooth and refreshed feeling without drying out. It doesn't leave any oil or glare on my skin either. While I haven't noticed any skin firming effects yet, I haven't found a problem either. It does seem to hydrate my skin so I am going to continue using it with hopes that more benefits come later. This was received as a #freeproduct in exchange for review."

The cons: it breaks me out and usually that's not a problem I really have. Breakouts are rare for me. Every time I use this more than twice, though, and I do. Use with caution!

While the packaging is nice, pretty pale pink frosted glass bottles, and the scent is lovely (personally prefer the serum scent over the cream scent) as well as a lovely feeling product texture before and after applying, it just did not do much for me. Like at all. Yeah my skin looks shinier (not necessarily a good thing depending on how shiny either technically but I am wondering if that is just me applying too much at once or something) and I guess my skin is brighter but as far as fine lines, dark circles (if that was included in what it was supposed to help with) and helping imperfections (uneven skin tones, dark spots, dark circles, etc etc) I feel like this is just making those imprefections hydrated feeling, BRIGHTER & more noticable than they were without putting product on. Skin less dull looking (a little) but rest of the imperfections are looking like center stage. I don't know. this product just didn't do it for me and maybe that has some to do with the fact I started out using the premier Cru line which is significantly more expensive than this one, but I actually felt more satisfied with the results immediately even & felt that line lived up better to what the products claims of doing. I'll maybe keep trying it here and there, MAYBE, just until I feel like I'm not wasting way too much of it if I stop using but I do not foresee recommending it or definitely not purchasing. #freeproduct #tryitwithtopbox"

When using the serum and the cream together at night, I feel like my skin becomes better each day, and they both work very well. They don’t clog pores, and don’t irritate my skin.    I like these vegan and clean beauty products. They both contain Resveratrol, which is good at firming skin and reducing wrinkles. They also contain Hyaluronic Acid, which is good at hydrating skin and making skin feel soft.    Suitable for my normal skin type. Good for both Summer and Winter time.

I am 35 years old, and I have normal skin. On the first day of trying the cream, I used the combination of the firming cashmere cream and the instant firming serum. After washing my face in the shower, I applied these products. My sensitive skin didn't turn bright red, the scent was pretty nice, and it felt luxurious on my skin. I was taken by surprise when I could feel my skin slowly tightening up just minutes after the first application of the combination. This combination gives me super smooth skin, and I can already see my pores appear smaller. Additionally, these two products leave a nice shine. To note, I added my foundation primer and foundation on top, and this canceled the shine. The downside was that my foundation was sitting in my pores rather than blending amongst them. I will use these creams on no makeup days. In summary, my face looks younger in that it appears taught.  On day two, I used just the firming cashmere cream. The scent is fine, and my face is extremely soft to the touch. The singular product doesn't get my face as tight as the combination of products, or as shiny. On day three, I used just the instant firming serum. I again feel that pairing the two products results in when you feel the most tightening on your face. Alone, this product provides a light shine and a light fragrance. On day four and beyond, I used the combination of the two products without foundation, and I'm happy with them!"

Ordinary, retinol products can cause some irritations or sensitivity to my skin and I haven't been to impressed in the past with the results anyway. Therefore, it hadn't been a product that I necessarily seemed out. However,  this one is VERY different. As I have aged, my skin tone has become uneven and my pores have become larger in appearance.  My eyes have fine lines and wrinkles, and skin discoloration has become a big point of contention as well. It took about three uses before I noticed the fine lines that were deeper set around my crows feet had almost disappeared. After a week, the age spots had diminished so much that they were almost gone. I didn't even have to cover them with make-up anymore. My skin tone improved after the first use. It was immediately more supple and hydrated. After about two weeks of use, my pores have almost diminished. I don't wear foundation anymore all because of this product. My only real critique would be that a spray foam or touch less application process would be preferable to minimize any bacterial transfer from hand to face at application but I will and have recommended this to ALL of my friends and family. This is an excellent product and I do not say that often. It is a bit pricier than other alternatives but you get what you pay for.  If you want young looking and feeling skin, then this will do it."

I might purchase it again just because I loved the scent and texture and was great for my sensitive skin."

So using it twice a day will last you 15 days for 80 dls.I don't feel I can go to sephora and return it.  So I don't know if sephora sent me a used package or it was packaged like that from caudalie.

I’ve been using the serum twice a day for about 4 weeks now and it’s a very nice serum.  It’s milky (so a thin consistency) and absorbs nicely for me.  ATM my skin is normal.  I was impressed with the hydration level.  Right now our weather fluctuates so on warm days I use less moisturizer.  There is a light scent (I’m not good at identifying scents) but it’s nice and doesn’t linger. I’m 52 and don’t have any injections.  So far I haven't notice improved firmness.  I realize everyone is different and results vary.  Their study shows 84% having firmer skin after 56 days, so I’m considering purchasing a bottle to test it further since I don’t firmer skin at this point. The reason for four stars is that I feel one bottle isn't quite enough to determine if it lives up to the claims. Overall this is a lovely product that I recommend.  It contains some stellar ingredients that have shown to provide anti-aging benefits (sometimes it's about prevention that we don't see)."

Super disappointing! I'll give this one more shot in that I'll re-order...but I REALLY hope my experience was just a one-time fluke, and that Caudalie isn't *actually* taking advantage of/shorting customers.

It’s doesn’t leave any kind of sticky residue on the skin and it doesn’t have much of a scent either. The bottle is glass and the pump is really easy to use and I’ve had no issues with it. My only complaint is that it’s almost gone and I will likely purchase another in a week or two. I usually have to use two pumps each use. It’s very liquidy so maybe I could stretch it by using one pump, I just feel like I always need a little more than that. It’s pricey for lasting a month, but it’s worth it. I have noticed that my skin is firmer overall, I can really see it in the jaw and cheeks, all areas really! I want the entire line now! Really impressed with this one and want to buy it for my mom and sister too."

That said, the price tag is very high for the amount of product, so if on a budget, definitely look and compare with other serums that work similarly.
