When I wore this on top of a foundation and applied it directly to my cheek from the stick, I noticed some separating of this highlighter (to be fair I have this same issue with other cream formulas). I tried blending it out with my fingers to make it look better, but up close it looked patchy. (When I blend it out with no foundation on my cheek, the separation issue went away. This highlighter blended out beautifully even just with my fingers when applied to plain skin. I loved that you could make it subtle for a shimmery look, or apply it thicker so that it reflected more metallic.) From far away, I don’t think you could tell the products weren’t cooperating with one another on my cheek. I only took one star off of my review because the product still worked other wise. It was still beautiful in my opinion. I absolutely adore the golden tone of this, and I feel like it can compliment multiple different skin tones. I also love the fact that this is so easy for on the go application! Since it’s in stick form, it takes up less room in your makeup or weekend bag too."

But I absolutely do not like this as a highlighter. It’s super pigmented, so very dark as a highlighter if you have lighter skin. This stuff is also super glittery! Like big chunks of glitter everywhere glittery. Which is not what I look for in a highlighter, personally. I do not like wearing straight up glitter all over my face. This is something I would use more like a cream shadow, so I think that’s how I’ll repurpose this. But I absolutely won’t be using this as a highlighter for sure."

It is ok since i am gonna be using it but if you are purchasing it as a gift, you might wanna buy in person at a store. Other than that, the formula itself and packaging is classic LYS style good."

			"review_text": "I was sent this product from LYS in exchange for a review. I have a few complaints about this highlighter stick. The first is the way it arrived. I can only presume that it melted in transit, so when I opened the component, the entirety of the product came out of the base and was lodged in the cap. I could not get it out, so after closing and opening it a few times, it made a giant mess. When I contacted LYS, their response was that it’s not their responsibility how the mail carrier handles the product during shipment and they did not offer to send me a replacement.  This is poor customer service and I can only hope they treat paying customers better. I would recommend ordering this from Sephora where you can return it if it comes melted as opposed to directly from LYS. My other complaint is the product itself is a glitter bomb. It’s full of big sparkles that are very obvious on the cheek. Maybe some people like that, but to me this is a very bad formula and looks like straight up glitter. Do not recommend."

I was gifted this color by the brand to try and I highly recommend it if you love an intense highlight with a little fine sparkle. It can be blended out for a slightly less dramatic highlight. In this pic, I’m wearing Aim High over the Lys cream blush stick, applied with a small brush. Since the description doesn’t specify the amount, this item is .21 oz, the same amount as the cream blush sticks. These an be a little fragile in shipping, mine arrived (from the brand directly, not Sephora) slightly damaged inside the tube without a lot of packing paper, but the product is just as gorgeous and slid right back into place. The packaging is the same size and shape as the bronzer stick and the cream blush stick, but this one is a shiny gold plastic exterior. Can’t wait to wear this more this summer, it’s stunning! At $20, I think these are a great value and I will likely purchase another shade once I have a chance to swatch in store. I’m leaving my honest review as a Sephora Community Ambassador."
