It started creasing before I was even able to set my undereyes with powder and didn't get better from that point on.   Returned.    PS - Also purchased the Tower 28 Swipe Hydrating Concealer and definitely prefer it in terms of the lightweight skincare-infused concealer category"

It became one with my skin immediately after blending it out and it just looks like skin. No patchiness, not accentuating any of my dry patches, nothing. If this doesn’t doesn’t sway you to buy this idk what will!! 1000/10 recommend! And I love the shade range!!"

From what I have tried it is definitely more dense then other brands that I have tried. It doesn't seam to spread as far as others leave more color instead of spreading and thinning it out. It is possible to get it to thin out but if you end up going that route it doesn't do a good job for coverage, more of thin color spread and not really concealing.   I have really dark under eyes and this works ok for that but not good enough for what I want. But it works great on my red spots on the sides of my nose and on blemishes.  I feel like in the future I could see myself buying this product if it was on sale because it doesn't cover the needs that I really want and because my skin is kind of weird( dark skin with a pale neutral undertone which makes it harder finding the right shade).  I would recommend to others that have an easier time finding the right color shades."

Minimal creasing under my eyes (there is no concealer that won't on my mature skin), and when I smooth away the creasing it dies not return throughout the day.

I personally feel like it smells a lot like glue and it slightly takes away from how amazing everything else is."

In short, this concealer is all that it says it is, hydrating, it's long wearing and natural, WHEN you prep, prime your face and set with powder. I tried the concealer by itself without my under eye primer, and without setting and it looked bad. On camera, it aged me and was very unnatural looking. However it redeemed itself once I primed and set, and I wore for 12 hours.. and it held up. I didn't feel the need to retouch my makeup at any point that day, and my under eyes did not look dry, which is a problem I can experience with full coverage concealers. Although full coverage, it looked natural, which I think made me feel slightly underwhelmed by this concealer. As much as it did a fantastic job, why am I not excited by the results? This Fenty concealer, performed just as good as my Natasha Denona concealer yet I am just bored by it, but it's a great everyday concealer. I don't wear my Natasha Denona concealer everyday because it can look too heavy for everyday but this Fenty concealer, I am more inclined because it's giving that coverage but yet looks NATURAL. And that is the take away from all this. My application tip would be this warning: it sets rather quickly so you can't take your time, and having the product just sit there. You want to work it into the skin quickly."

I am a neutral shade with an ever so slight golden undertone, and shade 170 is the perfect shade for me.

Getting great coverage in just one swipe is one of the things I love about it. The staying power is impressive, ensuring my look lasts throughout the day.  What adds to the experience is the subtle coconut-like scent – a delightful bonus that enhances the application. It effectively tackles under-eye circles and blemishes without any heavy feeling, providing a very natural look that's perfect for those no-makeup days.  However, it's worth noting that towards the end of the day, it can slightly emphasize dry skin or blemishes. Despite this, its overall performance has solidified its place as my favorite concealer."

I normally have a difficult time color matching when shopping online, but the template colors were very easy to match; the color I choose was perfect for my skin tone. The product packaging design is pretty, the tube and applicatior makes it convenient and easy to apply. The first time wearing this I was assuming it'd crease upon application but the consistency and texture + it blending so well with a sponge and not feeling dry or crinkly, mind-blowing! The amount of product you need is minimal  but it is able to be buildable, though in my experience a few small dots along the under eye work well. I followed up with clear powder after applying & blending the product & went about my day. About 6-8 hours later I checked in and my under eye area looked just as good as earlier on. I could have touched it up a little to ensure full coverage of the concealer but I didn't choose to because I was home for the day.  As far as blending the concealer out, I have used both a sponge and my finger which both worked very well, something that not all concealers can do (most need a sponge). Compared to other concealers, this one impressed me with the color match and minimal amount per usage needed to do the job. There is no scent to the product like a lot of other concealers I have used in the past. The product dries down and blends into the skin versus looking like it's on top of the skin, even after being blended and set. The product is not sticky or heavy feeling which is something so different for me. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone who is looking for a easy to use, effective and bendable/natural looking concealer."

I’ve used this product for daily for about a week now and I have to say that I am really impressed. I work long shifts in healthcare and find that the coverage lasts all day. I use concealer mainly to help cover my facial redness from rosacea and look for products that provide long lasting coverage for my redness while being hydrating to not settle into my fine lines. This Fenty concealer is perfect! It is very hydrating and provides buildable coverage that still gives you a natural look. And most importantly to me it is strong enough to cover my redness all day! It is also cruelty free as an added plus. I recommend this product to everyone looking for a hydrating buildable concealer, and especially other people out there struggling with facial redness. I’ve added before and after pictures to my review so you can see the difference Fenty makes!"

You could feel right away that it hydrates and brightens your skin.  It is also very light but has good coverage and most importantly lasts all day.  It is available in 50 diverse shades for all skin tones. I chose shade 230W and it’s the perfect match. I highly recommend it and I I will re-order it again thank you so much."

I’m really just upset that there needs to be more lighter toned concealers, hopefully they can correct this in the future because it is a nice formula!

			"review_text": "Thank you so much, Fenty, for sending me this product for free to review! I usually love all things Fenty, and this was the exact same way. The bottle is like a diamond and looks quite cool. The wand is also slanted, which I didn't expect but thought was a cool little touch. I am a bit worried that it could end up being damaged if taken out of the bottle wrongly, but for now, I like it. As for the concealer, the color is a bit misleading. When I first opened it and put it on, it looked way to light for me. Yet it blended out to be quite darker than expected. It worked out well for me in this sense, but be careful when picking a shade to buy. Other than that, the concealer is really hydrating (especially for my very dry skin). and is actually water-proof. As long as it dries down fully after being wet, there will be no creasing or loss of coverage at all.  Overall, I really liked this product; however, I don't know if it beats my Elf hydrating concealer, which I've been using for years. The cheapness of the Elf already gives it an upper hand, but for now, I like them both. Would recommend"

I wore it under my eyes without any powder and it did not crease and the coverage lasted all day. Very easy to blend and is medium to full coverage. It also worked well for covering up blemishes and I like how just a little bit of product goes a long way. I overall really like this concealer and would recommend it to those looking for a fuller coverage concealer that won't crease!"

I have an issue with concealers piling up in the creases, but this product doesn't do that. It is very thin and it covers the areas well without piling up. It feels like skin. The coverage is pretty good, you might want to add more for coverage. The best thing is how soft and thin it is, you don't feel like you are wearing anything."

Consistency is great at first—my one negative is that I feel it dries pretty quickly and I end up needing to apply toner or mist to really blend the way I want. This may be amplified by my dry skin though. Wears really well though—I noticed less creasing than with my typical undereye concealer. Overall a great product and a competitive price."

			"review_text": "I have received this product in exchange for an honest review.   Upon opening the product, I like there is a slight curvature to the doe foot applicator. For those that like to get more surface area painted, like the undereyes, this brush will hug against the contours of your eye socket or cheekbone unlike traditional straight applicators that require some hand angling to utilize the full brush. The pointed tip at the end is also versatile for spot concealing. While there is no fragrance added, there is a noticeable cosmetic scent if anyone is particularly wary of heavy scents in products.  The coverage is about light medium and can be built up without compromising too much of the skin like finish (almost satin/demi-matte). A few hours after application, both the swatches on the back of my hand and areas on my face that I spot concealed have retained the satin finish. As someone with oily skin, the product does fade somewhat after hours of wear but this is naturally occurring without touch ups or powdering. My fine lines and dry patches are not exaggerated with the initial wear. The blurring effect is achieved by the product mending with the skin's natural texture rather than filling in crevices. I did experience minor oxidation but it's almost undetectable under harsh LED light. Overall, I enjoy that the formula feels light on the skin and the natural finish will always be there whether I want a more sheer effect or more heavy duty coverage on acne marks."

I have dry facial skin and other foundations always emphasize the dryness of my skin, but this foundation masks all the imperfections and unevenness on my face. I like that it is not very dense, you don’t feel it on your face, you don’t feel like you have a mask on your face. It is also very convenient that this foundation with a brush can be applied precisely to pimples and redness. A big plus is that the shade suited me perfectly, it does not differ from the color of my skin."
