I think this product helps moisturize and soothe your dry scalp. It’s nice it’s not scented. If you’re looking for a miracle hair growing tonic this isn’t it (at least using it alone in a hair growth regime). I can’t recommend this product at 30ml for $60. I think you’re better to look at other scalp serums."

I see more growth on the edges of my hairline which is great! I love that this formula also includes hyaluronic acid in it as well to help with hydration, So cool this has the National Ezcema association Seal of approval, because the scalp is very sensitive and absorbs a lot so that gives me a little peace of mind. Great product would recommend"

			"review_text": "I recently started using Nécessaire’s The Scalp Serum, and I wanted to share my initial thoughts. The serum is very lightweight and absorbs quickly into my scalp, leaving no greasy residue. This is a big plus for me, as I don't like products that weigh down my fine hair. The dropper applicator makes it easy to target specific areas of the scalp and control the amount of product used.  So far, the serum hasn't caused any irritation on my scalp, which can sometimes be a concern with new products.  I appreciate that this product is free of harsh chemicals and fragrances.  While it's still too early to see any results in terms of hair growth or scalp health, I plan to continue using the serum for a longer period to assess its effectiveness.  The ingredients list seems promising.  If you're looking for a lightweight, gentle scalp serum with clean ingredients, then Nécessaire The Scalp Serum might be worth trying. However, keep in mind that it may take some time to see any noticeable results."

I like the how the formula is watery and light and not oily or heavy and leaves no residue. It’s easy to apply and dries quickly as you rub it in. I would say definitely apply it cautiously because it is watery and will run down your face so I just apply it little by little and then massage it in till dry since I’m focusing on the front of my hairline and the top of my scalp. I did notice some dandruff after a couple of days of using this and I’m not sure it it was from this or not so I won’t say it caused me to be flaky but I noticed that after using. I don’t think this has a smell at all as it is unscented and I didn’t notice anything so that’s good. I can’t speak for hair growth since I haven’t used it long enough yet and I believe best results are consistently over a couple of months so would probably need a bigger bottle but I will see if there is any difference after the 30 days is used up. I overall think the area applied did leave some shine and softness and still looked fresh after using with no irritation or heavy feeling or appearance, besides the possibility of flaking I like the benefits of this product and see its potential and hope it can help my hair get its thickness back as mine has become quite thinner then it used to be and I have hopes."

And let me tell you, it has helped to keep the horrible itch at bay better than any other hair oil I’ve tried. I just randomly apply the serum wherever it feels itchy that day, being careful not to let the applicator touch my hair or scalp, and rub it in well. It feels really soothing and the itch disappears. I have enough hair on my head to say I didn’t need any hair regrowth, but to my surprise the baby hairs at my hairline are growing out nicely. I absolutely adore all the nourishing ingredients in this that are also safe for sensitive scalps like mine. Thank you Nécessaire for making such a great product!"

After using this serum, my scalp feels less irritated, and my hair looks fuller. It's definitely going to be a product I continue to use to help my thinning hair be fuller and thicker!"

The serum feels more of water-based, then a gel serum or cream serum. I will say to be a little careful applying, since it is runny, the water formula went to my forehead a little. When it comes to the scent, I like that the aroma is light, to the point it almost smells like nothing. The closest I can give for example of the scent is, that it smells like my sea moss, but not as strong. It says it will take 90 days to see full results, will post them on Instagram, hopefully, it does since my top has a little hair breakage from bleaching."

What I appreciate most is its effectiveness in promoting healthier hair growth. I’ve noticed less hair fall and increased thickness in my strands. Additionally, the convenient packaging with a dropper makes application a breeze. Overall, I highly recommend this scalp essence for anyone looking to improve the health of their scalp and achieve stronger, more vibrant hair.

You definitely don’t have to wash it out the same day as application if you don’t want to! the serum absorbs super fast into my scalp so I could style my hair and go about my day.

My hair feels stronger when I brush it and I have less hair in the drain which is huge for me. I can’t yet say that I have a ton of new hairs coming out, I would use it for longer than a month to see but I do notice fullness in the root area.  I also prefer to use lighter products as heavy oils can leave a tint on my light hair and this serum is great because it’s transparent.

I love Necessaire, but this misleading repackaging is leaving a sour taste in my mouth.  I'm not sure if the product works. It literally feels like water. Guess this helps with the no residue feeling.   At $70/60 ml, the price was already steep enough, but $60/30 ml no way is it worth purchasing. At this point, you might as well pay a little bit extra and see a doctor who will prescribe you a medical grade formula for thinning hair/hair loss.   I feel bad for the people who have thinning hair, and this brand is predating their despair. It's not cool, Necessaire, not cool."

It’s a subtle difference, but enough for my family and I to notice a change. The serum is lightweight and dries quickly, and it does not build up on my oily scalp. If anything, it prolongs my washes by hydrating my scalp and it looks less oily now. I loved this serum so much I also added the Nécessaire shampoo and conditioner into my rotation.

This product only works if you take the time to regularly use it and wait to see the results - hence not fitting into Sephora's return policy window.

I was cleaning so much hair out of the drain after every shower that it was kind of alarming, and now there’s hardly any hair left in my drain or in my hairbrush. It is such a light and unobtrusive product to apply that I really doubted it would make a difference, but I’m so glad I got it.  My hair fall has done a total 180 thanks to this stuff, and I think it has really contributed to better hair and scalp health overall. My hair feels fuller, and it feels really good not being in panic mode about losing so much hair."

My hair is naturally very thin and fine, so I wasn’t expecting miracles, but I was willing to give it a shot. For the past 3 months I’ve faithfully applied a couple droppers to my scalp every day, massaging it in afterwards. It’s a really runny substance, not unlike water, so it works best if you apply right after the shower. You can’t feel it in your hair at all; it doesn’t weigh your hair down nor can you feel it on your scalp. I wasn’t sure if it was doing anything, but then after about a month and a half, I started to see a lot of baby hairs along my hairline. If you look at my before and after photos, you can see tons of baby hair growth. I won’t lie, I have no idea if the serum is to thank, or if it would’ve happened anyway… but I’ll take it. I also have noticed an overall improvement in my scalp health, so that’s also a plus. A bottle of this lasts about a month and a half with daily use, and I’ve gone through two bottles. I was gifted those first two bottles, but I intend to repurchase. I’m happy enough with my results that I will continue to use it and I recommend trying it."

I was most interested and curious to use the serum since it contains Niacinamide and a peptide blend. I had great results with those ingredients in my regular facial skincare products. Hair loss prevention products are def not something you notice after a couple of usage. It does take time and sometimes several products to notice a difference. I have been using the seurm for awhile, what I notice is a slight hair growth. There were a few small little baby hair growing out. I notice less hair shed and stronger hair. Which is a plus in my book."

The first thing I’ve noticed is that my scalp felt really good after the serum application - hydrated and no greasy feeling. After about a week of use I realized that my scalp’s Ph balance must’ve improved because all of the signs of occasional irritations (feeling itchy) have disappeared.  I’ve been using the serum for 2+ weeks now and obviously there won’t be any quick results with hair growth, but so far I feel like the this product is doing great things for my scalp, so I’m looking forward to see more results in the near future."
