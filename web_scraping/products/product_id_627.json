    "ingredients": "Alcohol Denat., Parfum/Fragrance, Aqua/Water/Eau, Hydroxycitronellal, Benzyl Salicylate, Linalool, Coumarin, Hexyl Cinnamal, Limonene, Benzyl Benzoate, Citronellol, Benzyl Cinnamate, Geraniol, Benzyl Alcohol, Citral, Cinnamal, Isoeugenol.",
    "how_to_use": "Suggested Usage:.-Fragrance is intensified by the warmth of your own body. Apply in the creases of your knees and elbows for a longer-lasting, stronger scent.&nbsp;.-After applying, avoid rubbing or dabbing skin. This breaks down the fragrance, causing it to wear off more quickly.&nbsp;.-If you prefer placing fragrance on your wrists, be sure to reapply after frequent handwashing, as this tends to rinse off the scent.&nbsp;.-Replace fragrance after 12 months. Expired perfumes more than a year old lose the integrity of the original scent...Eau de Toilette or Eau de Parfum?: .The difference lies in the volume of perfume oil. While EDT contains five to nine percent, EDP contains more, usually eight to 14 percent. EDPs, therefore, last longer and smell more intense.",

This is a good smelling perfume, but it's just a perfume type of scent if that makes any sense. This smells like perfume it doesn't hit any notes I can detect distinctly. If you just need a good smelling day to day, maybe even evening perfume, this could be nice. I personally like smelling notes in my perfume. I can't detect as to what it is or smells like. I'm going to have to stop reading reviews they always are paid reviews anymore, telling you lies on everything now just so someone can get a freebe. I read the reviews on how this smells just so vanilla and sweet. I would say there is something lightly sweet in this but not vanilla. If you're like me and love most vanilla based perfumes and body mist, this will not be for you. If you're a millennial and remember Tommy girl perfume, i wore that nonstop this is kinda that type of perfume i don't mean they smell the same i mean it's like a perfume type of scent you don't know what it smells like it just smells good. Anyways, it is not bad by any means it's just not my scent profile."

From the first spritz, the top notes of duo vanilla envelop you in a warm, inviting embrace, creating an instantly comforting experience that draws you in.  As the scent evolves, the heart reveals the enchanting Vanilla Orchid, adding a layer of sophistication to the sweetness. This floral note introduces a velvety soft texture that enhances the warmth of the vanilla, resulting in a lush, harmonious blend that feels both luxurious and approachable without overpowering the vanilla but is rather an undertone to it.   The base ozonic notes bring a refreshing contrast, providing a light and airy quality that balances the semi-sweetness of the vanilla and the floral of the orchid. This unique combination creates an intriguing depth, making the fragrance feel vibrant and dynamic.  One of the standout features of Gucci Flora Gorgeous Orchid is its longevity. This scent has a slow burn, gradually unfolding over time, which means it lingers beautifully on the skin throughout the day. You'll find that it evolves, revealing its complexities in a way that keeps you enchanted long after the initial application.  Versatile enough for both daytime wear and evening occasions, this fragrance is perfect for those who appreciate a sweet yet sophisticated scent that can transition seamlessly. Its moderate sillage leaves a delightful trail, ensuring you make a lasting impression without being overwhelming.  In a world of fleeting fragrances, Gucci Flora Gorgeous Orchid is here to stay and offers a sweet, enduring experience that invites you to indulge in its floral warmth. If youu2019re seeking a scent that balances sweetness with elegance and lasts beautifully, look no further. Embrace the enchanting allure of Gucci Flora Gorgeous Orchid and let your essence bloom!"

Not a single floral scent has ever made it into my favorites; in fact, most of the time I feel they make me smell like an old woman. But this, this is something different! It is obviously floral, but it's also got those sweet and intoxicating notes you see in vanilla perfumes, while also not being strictly vanilla. This feels especially good for colder weather months, which brings out the warmth, but I can see it not being overpowering in the summer. I received a sample of this but I definitely plan on buying a full sized bottle when I can. If you're like me and are hesitant to try out floral perfumes, this seems like a great balance between floral and gourmand."

The vanilla scent is balanced nicely with the ozonic accord freshness. Doesnu2019t smell too sweet vanilla which I enjoy. If youu2019re a vanilla scent lover though this might not satisfy you enough. Might be best to stick with the Ariana Grande Cloud perfume which is also a warm scent and comes off way more smelling like sweet vanilla. Overall, for me though, I enjoyed the scent of this perfume and would wear it out just due to its unique take on a vanilla scent. Plus, it doesnu2019t hurt that that packaging of the bottle just glows with that lovely shade of yellow. Would look beautiful on any perfume shelf."

Scent 7/10: Top note opens with this light, airy sweetness going on, definitely picking up some vanilla but it's not in-your-face sweet. No harsh alcohol smell (thank goodness!). I know some folks have been getting banana Laffy Taffy vibes, but I'm not really catching that. It's more of a fruity floral to my nose at first, then the vanilla kicks in stronger later, getting all creamy and gourmand-y. Orchid in the middle note started to come out after 15 mins.    Sillage 7/10:  The sweetness actually amps up about half an hour in, which is nice    Longevity 5/10: eh, it's okay. Hangs around for a decent while, but after about 4 hours, it's basically a skin scent.  Overall 6.75/10 : Not mind-blowing or anything, but not bad either. I can see this working for younger girls, maybe early 20s. It's pretty safe/inoffensive  and can be everyday wear. Feels like a good late summer/early fall scent, or maybe early spring time. If you're into sweet scents, this can be safe blindbuy. It's not going to give you a headache or anything. Just don't expect something super unique or groundbreaking, you know? However, I feel this is the nicest Gucci Flora I have smelled. I havenu2019t been too keen on this line since none of them has impressed me but this one is a little different."
