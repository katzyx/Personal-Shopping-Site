			"review_text": "love this set. the eye balm is like an actual balm so i take it with me to touch up under my eyes thru out the day.   I alsk use it under my eyes with no makeup and will still layer a cream on top of it. i'm sure it can be worn alone, but it seems a little too light for my eyes, but I still absolutely love it. doenst causes creasing or piling.  The gloss changes color on and becomes more of a rosy tint. Absolutely, adore it, very hydrated lips. This is like the perfect set to give as a gift. Especially for someone who's traveling."
