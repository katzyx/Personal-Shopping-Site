As someone with combination skin prone to dullness, I’ve seen a remarkable transformation—my complexion now looks healthier and more radiant. The container is made of metal and has some weight to it.   The serum feels lightweight and absorbs quickly, providing an instant refreshing sensation. While it does have a slightly off-putting smell, it fades fast. Despite this minor drawback, I’d rate it 4 out of 5 stars! Overall, it’s a great product."

I have sensitive combination skin, and this product felt a bit too strong for my skin. It dried my skin, and I did experience redness, itchiness, sensitivity, and even breakouts. For now, I stopped using it and will see how it will work out for my skin in the future."

It absorbs seamlessly and leaves my face feeling nourished and healthy, not tight or flaky. The real magic is in how effectively it targets fine lines, wrinkles, and sun damage. I've noticed a significant reduction in the appearance of my crow's feet and forehead creases. My skin just looks so much more plump and rejuvenated."

I’ve been using Retinol Reform by Shani for 2 weeks, and I’ve noticed an improvement in the appearance of my face. Following the instructions on the packaging, I used it twice the first week and three times the second week, to allow my skin to tolerate the cream. It has a lightweight texture, absorbs quickly into the skin, and I finished by applying moisturizer and, every morning, sunscreen. So far, I’ve noticed smoother, firmer, and most importantly, more radiant skin. I didn’t experience any side effects from using this cream, so I’ll continue using it for 2 more weeks to see the final results and achieve a more radiant and healthy skin. I definitely recommend it."

The texture is so smooth, and it instantly brightens my skin, giving me a gorgeous glow right away. I’ve been searching for a retinol product to help reduce wrinkles and dark spots, and this serum checks all the boxes. It’s super gentle on my skin with no irritation, which is such a relief because I’ve had issues with retinol in the past. After applying the serum, I wait a few minutes for it to absorb and then follow up with my moisturizer. It feels so lightweight and works seamlessly with the rest of my skincare. I’m excited to keep using it and can’t wait to see softer, smoother, and more youthful-looking skin. If you’re looking for a retinol that’s effective but gentle, I  recommend trying this one."

What I love most is that it’s a combo of retinol and lactic acid, so it tackles fine lines, dark spots, and uneven texture all at once.  Now, here’s the kicker: it’s gentle enough to use regularly (I started with 2-3 times a week), and my skin didn’t freak out. That’s a win, especially if you’re retinol-shy. After just a few weeks, I noticed my skin looking more radiant and smoother—like that lit-from-within glow. It’s definitely on the pricier side, but honestly, it feels like a splurge that delivers.

			"review_text": "Unfortunately, this was a miss for me. I REALLY wanted to like it, but ultimately returned it for two reasons. The first, was that this broke me out.  I know about the retinol purge and have never experienced it with any other retinoid products I've used, but I kept trialing this over about a 6 week period to see if the breakouts would stop. I ONLY got breakouts the morning after using this product, never on any other day. I figured that by the 4th or 5th use it would stop or wane, if it really was a purge, but it didn't.   The second reason I returned it, is because of the lack of transparency. I did some research before purchasing - it's on lots of best lists and lots of people say it brings results. But shortly after I purchased, I felt like I needed to look again. I realized that the strength or percentage of retinol in this product was nowhere to be found! I saw the brand answer this question -- they claimed that the formula and percentage was proprietary and is not shared. This made me really nervous, but I told myself: I trust Shani and her brand, and if it works, it works. But after dealing with the breakouts, I did further research and realized that it really wasn't appropriate to be using a retinoid product where I had NO CLUE about the strength/concentration of the formula. I'd have no idea how to adjust, up or down, to get to a product or formula that works for me! As someone who tries to be an informed consumer, this became a red flag that I feel I shouldn't have ignored in favor of efficacy, because there's plenty of other effective retinoids where I know what I'm getting.   I've since tried a new retinoid, a retinal, that gave me zero irritation and zero breakouts, so unfortunately I do know it was this product that was causing my issue. I would encourage this brand to let consumers know the percentage of retinol in this product. Transparency can only help your consumers, if that's what's truly important to your brand!"

The purging that can happen to your skin once you start using it ( your skin can get worse before it gets better) and coming from someone that has had really bad acne I really didn't want to go through that again if I didn't have too, your skin can get really dry, and it can take sometime for your skin to get used to it. Well here's the thing, I bought this back in late December, I was so scared of the above things I mentioned to happen so I never used it. And then I started to use it 2 weeks ago, and non of the 'bad' things happened also to note, I do have sensitive skin. It doesn't smell bad to me either which a few people complained about. I purchased the small one, one because the big one is in the hundreds, but also I am not using it on my entire face and I use literally a pea sized amount ONLY on my chin, every second night. So I thought the smaller one was better for my needs. The reason I rated this at 4 stars is simply because of the price, nothing else. It is an amazing product that I will be buying again!"

First, the packaging is sleek and convenient, making it easy to dispense the right amount of product without any mess. The serum itself has a lightweight and silky texture that absorbs quickly into the skin, leaving no greasy residue behind. What truly sets the Shani Darden Moisture Boost Plumping Serum apart is its plumping effect. My skin looks noticeably more supple and youthful, and fine lines around my eyes and mouth appear softened. It's like a burst of hydration that lasts throughout the day. I appreciate that this serum is suitable for all skin types, including sensitive skin. I've had no adverse reactions, redness, or breakouts since incorporating it into my routine. While the price point is higher than some other serums on the market, I believe the results justify the investment. A little goes a long way, so the bottle should last for a decent amount of time. In conclusion, this serum has become a staple in my skincare routine. If you're struggling with dryness, fine lines, or just want to give your skin a boost of hydration, I highly recommend giving this serum a try. It's a luxurious treat for your skin that delivers on its promises."

However, I have to say I really miss having this retinol in my night routine!! This is so far the only retinol product that has lived up to the name of retinol, this magical ingredient that so many products now include. When I use the retinol reform at night, I wake up with super smooth skin the next morning and it doesn’t dry me out like other retinol products do!! Definitely worth the price and I will be buying a full size bottle soon!!"

It says it is fragrance free but I do smell a slight smell to it, but it's not bad. It has a thick consistency but it applied to my face nicely. After 3 weeks of use I have noticed my pores look smaller, especially around my nose area.  The fine lines around my eyes aren't as noticeable.  I had a friend ask what I was doing differently because she said my face looked more radiant.  I know this is pricey but it really is worth it. The bottle is heavy and feels like good quality.  I dropped it a few times and nothing broke. I have issues with fine lines and redness and I feel this product did exactly what it says it claims it does.

I have heard it countless times…wash, moisturize, retinol and sunscreen are the 4 steps to clean, youthful skin!!! And while I’ve been Retin-A’s number one fan for many years, I have always had to be so strategic about not putting it in certain areas, to taper off in the sunny, summer months, not to use it before certain events because I might be in a peeling faze…and so on!! Because there’s so much to think about every time I slather that magic potion on my face, I tend to use it less often than I should!!   Insert Shani Darden’s Retinol Reform!! The first week I had it, I let my skin be my guide!!! I used it for 7 days straight before I took a lazy break (ie. I was too lazy to wash my face and put it on before bed). First thought was, is this working…because I wasn’t flaking, I wasn’t getting raw in areas around my eyes or nose and my skin felt perfectly happy!! The 2nd week is when I noticed, my face was in a very happy place!! My skin tone looked more even, my texture was smooth and I still didn’t have any skin sensitivity!!! Week 3, I realize that this could be something I can use daily because my skin had zero sensitivity to it and it left my skin looking improved from where I started 3 weeks prior.  My take away is, it is a lightweight formula, with a mild scent and it’s verrrryyyyy gentle…maybe a little too gentle for the more mature issues I’m trying to address…but absolutely perfect for someone who is just starting a retinol or has sensitive skin."

I received this serum free from Influenster for my honest opinion after using.  This had been on my “wish list” at Sephora for a while. This is not the first retinol I’ve used but so far it’s the best!  I’m 43 and can use all the help I can get when it comes to fine lines and brightening my skin. I’ve been using for 2-3x a week at night for the last 2 months. I’ve had no issues with using - no irritation. Serum is creamy & light and absorbs nicely into the skin. Sometimes I use a night time moisturizer along with it, but you don’t have to. When I wake up my face feels extremely smooth. I’ve noticed an overall change in the texture of my skin (softer/smoother), brighter/glowing and reduction of fine lines in my forehead and neck area. Overall, I’m thrilled that I got to try this and will continue to have this as part of my nighttime skincare routine!"

I have combo-leaning dry, sensitive, reactive skin. I take pretty good care of it but I have been having issues with texture on my forehead and on my cheek areas - basically beside my nose going downwards on the sides of my mouth - for years. I have wished at many times to have my oily skin back, but I reckon this is just aging. I have used a lot of different acidic products with varying degrees of success. I prefer glycolic acid over lactic but went into trying Retinol Reform with an open and hopeful mind. First, it’s incredibly gentle. I had zero reactions, redness, anything negative. Absorbs quick, and doesn’t have much of a scent. It’s more moisturizing than I expected. I currently use it 4-5 nights a week and l think this is one of the, if not the, best retinol products I’ve tried. The texture on my forehead is gone, and the other areas I had issue with has drastically decreased. I can see/feel a huge difference. My skin looks clearer, smoother, and feels great. The only caveat is (and maybe this is just across the board w/retinol, idk) if I don’t stay consistent using this, the texture slowly comes back, and my skin feels really dry and flaky. I am aware this is (for me) an expensive product, but the results are there, and I plan to keep using this. I’m very pleased with the performance and have had no problem using this with my other products. I really can’t think of a negative, other than price, and if you don’t use it regularly you won’t continue to see results so… just keep on using it and your skin will look great! I always follow up with a moisturizer and use a spf 50 during the day if I’ll be outside. Very good quality and hope to try more products from Shani Darden soon."

Any lines I didn't realize I had are smooth now making my skin look great. I absolutely believe this will help with any future skin issues I may have!

When I was sent this product I wondered, “Why use an anti-aging product when I’m not even 30 yet?” Well it turns out this was a product I didn’t know I needed. Prior to reading the box for this product I knew nothing about retinol which is the primary ingredient in this serum. Anti-aging products were simply well out of my realm of awareness. Retinol is known to reduce fine lines, firm and brighten skin as this product claims to do. I didn’t start with many fine lines though I laugh and smile a whole so I can’t speak for that but I can say that since incorporating this into my nightmare skincare routine, I have seen a noticeable difference in the bounce of my skin, smoothness overall and brightness. I don’t about retinol as a stand-alone but this product is the truth. It is a little high end ringing at $88 a bottle but what’s cheaper this or a facelift? Not to mention the infrequency you use this (1-2 times a week) makes the product stretch. I started testing this product 3 weeks ago (when I took my before photo) and I just recorded my after video right before posting this. Color me impressed. I will gladly spend my money on this product when it runs out. Toodles!"

So far, I haven’t experienced any redness, peeling, dryness, or irritation so that is a positive. The lactic acid in addition to the retinol seems to have made my skin texture a bit smoother as well. Because this retinol formula is so easy to tolerate and the lactic acid is a nice addition, I would consider this a better-than-average retinol product. It absorbs quickly and didn’t cause any breakouts, which is also a positive. I’ll need to finish the bottle to see if there are any additional improvement in terms of fine lines, firmness, or other anti-aging benefits. Typically it would take about 6-8 weeks for a skincare product to prove effective, so I may update this after the bottle is finished to determine whether or not I will repurchase on my own."

I was thrilled to recieve this product, as I've already been using it in my daily skincare routine for about 2 years. I have super sensitive, breakout-prone skin, and was starting to notice some signs of aging (fine lines, uneven tone, lack of firmness, etc.) as I neared 40. I was nervous starting a retinol, so I started slowly, using it twice a week, and slowly building up to every day use. I did go through a tough 2 month when I started, as with many retinols your skin looks worse before it gets better. I'm glad I stuck with it, as I consider this product a staple in my skincare routine. It retails for ~$88 @sephora. Full disclosure: I also regularly get botox, have gotten filler, and have gone through four RF Microneedling (Morpheus8) treatments, so I consider my current skin to be a reflection of all of those along with this product."

I’ve been able to use it daily with no irritation issues. I’ve used retinol products off and on and some have irritated my skin while others where fine. If you’ve never used a retinol or chemical exfoliater I would start slow. Be sure to use a good SPF as you’ll be a lot more sun sensitive. If you’re nervous about starting retinols this is a good one to start with and get your skin used to the product."

In fairness to the product, I’ve only been using it for about 3 weeks, when 12 weeks is recommended. It is a very mild Retinol. It was recommended 1-2 pumps 1-2 days per week to start, followed by moisturizer. I was easily able to use it 4 times per week with no irritation. However, I do not like the smell. It is a bit mildewy and the smell lingers for a while after you’ve applied it. I have also not noticed any changes in my fine lines and dark spots. As I said above, I haven’t been using it for the full 12 weeks, but I expected to see some difference in a product at this price point. I will edit this post if I see better results in a few weeks, but right now I’d only give this product 2 stars and that’s mainly because it’s very gently on the skin."

The redness that I typically experience on my cheeks and under my eyes has greatly improved, and I also noticed that the lines I have on my forehead became smaller over the course of these two weeks. The only reason I gave this four stars instead of five was because my skin became very dry (which it does say can happen on the label - it tells you to use by using 1-2x per week and increase as your skin can handle). I used it 1x the first week and 2x the second week, but noticed this week that my skin really needed a lot of moisture on the days after I used it and does feel a bit tighter and drier than normal. I was not shocked by this, since I have very sensitive skin and my skin is a bit on the drier side. However, I am hopeful that my skin will become used to it as I really think it works very well, and I'm excited to keep on using it to reduce my red/uneven skin tone and forehead lines."

Influencer sent me a free Shani Darden Retinol Reform to review at just  the right time.  Retinol is a scary word and there are safety concerns and instructions addressed on the box and witching the packaging.  I started using the product the very night I received it.  I was pleasantly surprised that my skin instantly felt firmer yet not dry or the “stretched to tight” feeling that sometimes occurs with creams.  It also didn’t feel as if it over compensated the dryness by leaving my skin greasy looking, it could have even been a bit more moisturizing.  I’ve used the Retinol Reform for over two weeks and I’m quite pleased.  My skin feels better, my uneven skin texture had improved greatly, and my fine lines are a little less noticeable.  I am excited to continue using Retinol Reform and seeing what more it can do to improve my face.  Shani Darden Skin Care made a product they should be proud of, it delivers the retinol needed for improvement without being harsh to the skin, even if your skin is a little on the sensitive side like mine, you won’t be let down.  Nobody needs to be in their forties looking like they are over forty, this product can assist in keeping the masses guessing on how you could really be a grandmother."

I am leaving this review in exchange for receiving the product for free from influenster, and was asked to leave an honest review of the product. I was satisfied with the scent and texture of the serum as well as the efficacy of how well it helped reduce the redness I deal with on a day to day basis. I am a male so I don’t wear makeup and have always felt self conscious about being a little more red than others, sometimes even get asked if I’m sun burnt etc. The retinol serum did help reduce the redness, it didn’t eliminate it completely but the change was noticeable enough to earn my 5 stars."

I historically have had a lot of negative reactions as my skin had suffered from over-sensitivity and various other issues in the past. As my skin has strengthened, Ive been able to try things like this, but I still do so with an abundance of caution. Ive found that lactic acid doesnt really take well on me(if it does, it plateaus and becomes ineffective after awhile - this was true of Sunday Riley's formulation), AHA/BHA's are kind of meh for me, and retinol works, but feels the most abrasive in my experience. I havent sought a treatment like this for quite some time, but when I got some samples of this, I decided to give it a try. Im happy so far. I recently switched up my makeup routine for lighter formulations, so I definitely felt a little more pressured to up the ante on my exfoliation routine - I do have some stubborn textured spots. Im happy to say that after using this for a couple weeks, my makeup looks so much smoother(!) on my face now. Im not sure if I could have achieved that look without it. I will be giving the full size a shot when I finish up all my samples :)"

Pinchme sent me a complimentary sample of Shani Darden’s Retinol Reform Serum for product testing purposes. The serum claims to contain 2.2% Encapsulated Retinol and 2% Lactic Acid. This serum helps reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkle by boosting collagen production. It also brightens and smooths the skin.  I noticed changes in my skin on the second day as  my skin appeared brighter and had a more youthful appearance. By the 4th day I was shook when my skin looked tighter, smoother and a glow from within. Also, my face had a glow to it. This formula is free of Paraben, Phthalates, Gluten, Oils, Sulfates, Fragrances. Also, cruelty-free and vegan. This product has been awarded the Luxury Beauty Award in 2020 by Town and Country and the 2020 Clean Beauty award by Allure. The only Con I see is that the claims of the amount of renitnol do not seem supported by the ingredient list.  I was extremely skeptical about this product as the reviews seemed more like myth than what could be true.  But the reviews are fact.  Get this and give it a try!"

So I asked some friends what's the best retinol with my skin concerns and I received so many recommendations that I got overwhelmed. I received a sample and was hesitant to go through another frustrating experience but I said you only live once and tried Shani Darden Retinol reform and this is by far the best retinol serum on the skincare market. I've notice my fine lines reduce and smooth and some of my dark spots faded tremendously. There is no scent, easy to apply on your freshly cleanse face and a little goes a long way. I use it 3x times a week I don't want to over do it even though it's doing wonders for my skin. Overall a great product I didn't experience drying my skin out or redness and especially no breakouts Hallelujah. My skin is glowing, clear, smooth and looking younger.

This might be good for some people who don’t really have a “right here right now” attitude but for people like me who like to see the product actually putting in the muscle strength and seeing results fairly quickly, it ain’t this. I much more prefer the ordinary retinol 1% which is a fraction of the cost. Also FYI, for people dealing with persistent acne that won’t go away no matter what please try TACTUPUMP. It’s a prescription and can run you upwards of $250 so hopefully you have a drug plan but I’m telling you - I tried everything and I mean EVERYTHING including breast milk, garlic, retinols etc. and nothing works like TACTUPUMP. Ask you doctor!"

Shani Darden Retinol Reform is what I'm using at the moment and I have seen results after 4 week of consistent, nightly use. The gel-cream texture of this serum feels so cool against my skin and absorbs like a dream. When used on its own, it leaves behind zero residue feeling or greasiness. When used with certain other products in my night routine it doesn't mix well and create a face full of jelly ball pilling that looks and feels, um, gross. Keep that in mind! I wish brands would list ingredients that may possibly react badly with other ingredients! Overall though, I definitely like the results I'm getting so far and will continue to use my Retinol Reform every single night. It takes about 4 weeks of consistent use to see real visible results."

I did follow the instructions. Starting using one njght the first week then added another night each week. I now use daily.

On top of things looking much smoother, I also haven’t had the dryness or redness other retinols would sometime cause, and I haven’t buffered it with any moisturizers so I’m happy.

To this day I have not been able to find another product that did the same. I was thrilled! Plus, it didn't take long to begin to actually see more changes. My skin simply looked better... healthier. Shani Darden's Retinol Reform Serum is truly remarkable. It does not contain parabens, gluten, fragrances or surface oils. All of this contributing to reduce the visible signs of aging. I believe this serum is best used at night, on clean & dried skin before evening moisturizing. I strongly suggest to any and everyone who has anti-aging issues to try this. It did not disappoint me and I don't think it will you either!"

It wasn't harsh on my skin and for sure helped calm down incoming zits, reduced the appearance of fine lines on my forehead and helped overall with my texture. I used this 4x a week. That being said, do I think it's worth the price? Meh. I moved on to another brand (starting low and slow) and I've had way better results in the first 4 weeks of using the new brand. The new retinol is also less expensive with decades of research and data to back it up. I do think this product is worth it for maintenance purposes and would repurchase in the future for use in the warmer months and reserve my stronger retinol for the winter."

The ingredients sound amazing, but if you are prone to irritation from retinol and chemical exfoliants be very careful with this product. I’m pretty experienced with both, and I’ve never developed this kind of stinging, redness and flaking after ONE use.  Ingredients and formulation are high quality—this is a powerful retinol serum and I’m sure a holy grail for some. But if you have dry or even the slightest bit sensitized skin, mixing lactic acid with retinol might wreak havoc on your skin like it did mine. Not worth trying to build up a tolerance for me, just going to stick with gentler products."

I have noticed my skin tone looks more even and, while I don't have many fine lines, those I do have appear softened. I was not able to scale up my usage, however, due to dryness. This could be caused by the unseasonably cold weather and the effect of constantly running the heather to stay warm. I have tried to increase my use of the humidifier to offset this but could still only tolerate 2x per week. I liked how easy it was to smooth on my skin and did not find the product to be greasy. I do not suffer from breakouts in general and did not have any problems with acne while using this product. I would probably purchase again, maybe in warmer weather and especially if they offered a more moisturizing version."

I think it helped my texture more than any other product I've used in the past, perhaps that's the lactic acid in it, but it's nice to have it already in this so I don't have to purchase and use an additional product. I cant honestly say that I've noticed an improvement in any existing spots because I've been using azealic acid for about 2 months before I started using this and I didn't notice any additional improvement from what I had been seeing with the azealic acid already. as for anti aging, fine lines are not currently an issue so I had nothing to compare to before. with all that said this does have a high price point BUT they offer a deluxe sample size that offers what I think is more than enough to see if it will work for you before committing to a larger, pricier size."

It’s helped to smooth out my fine lines on my face, my skin looks more radiant, and it’s helped to clear up my blemishes. I have relatively sensitive skin, and this serum didn’t bother it at all, like some other Retinols. I’ve been using it every other day for a few weeks now, and am very pleased with my results.

I haven't seen much change in the dark/sun spots but I think that takes more time as has been my experience with other retinol creams. There is a scent... I don't love it... BUT what I do love is that it's not overly fragrant. This doesn't feel perfumey at all... might just be the smell from all the ingredients combined. Overall I would recommend it and will continue to apply it to my skin for longer lasting results."

Even though I have very oily eyelids it worked very well and did not make them oilier or caused any breakouts. I'm very pleased with how it performs but since I am new to the product I don't know if the fragrance free feature is a real thing or if the product I got was rancid because it smelled like an old perfume that has been sitting on your granny's table for years, thats how i can describe and it did not harm my eyes or anything so I've kept using it but I think I will forever wonder what should it really smell like... or not smell like.

I already have a holy grail retinol product (Paula’s Choice) that I use religiously as often as my skin can tolerate it, usually 3-4 nights per week. On non retinol nights I tend to use AHA serums, for the chemical exfoliation. I love having the option of using a more gentle retinol formula that includes AHAs... this is where Retinol Reform steps in. Reform is a more gentle formula, but still very effective. I love alternating Reform with a stronger retinol formula throughout the week. And Reform having AHA chemical exfoliants is a huge plus! My skin tolerates Reform well, I’ve never had a negative reaction or irritation. After using I wake up to smoother and brighter skin. This product is on the pricier side but it’s a lovely formula and a definite repurchase for me. Love that Shani offers a smaller size to trial for only $30. For reference I am 43 with sensitive combo/dry skin."

Minimal ingredient list, I could use it EVERYWHERE. Eyes included. I woke up feeling like a newborn baby after retinol nights. The new formula - lacking that magic that took Shani to the top. The ingredient list is double the size and retinol is pushed further down the list, I can't use it around my eyes anymore as I got horrible dry, scaly patches and some on my forehead as well. I was in such denial I blamed it on every other product except shani's because I was that sure she wouldn't do us like that. I still use the product and I'm giving it a 4 because it's still a good product but it's the same as every other retinol now. Sigh* I wish people would stop messing with beautiful formulas just to make it mainstream. I would've paid double the price if she had kept the OG ingredient list and sold as an independent retailer. I know it's all politricks in the beauty industry but this was a bummer."

There was no irritation at all so easy to use for those that might have not used retinol before. Since my skin is used to retinol I did not see a huge difference on my skin but it’s a serum that you can easily incorporate into your routine. My one problem is that the serum “pilled” when I put a moisturizer on top so maybe it does not mix well with certain moisturizers (I was using Augustine Bader and Bare Minerals)."

I had some tiny fine lines around my eyes and now there less noticeable and feel more smoothed out. It also makes your face really soft. I'm not sure yet how it will do with deeper wrinkles only time will tell. I've only been using this product close to two weeks and already notice the difference around my eyes. I'm overall satisfied with this product."

The good part is that this product is much gentler, and I had zero irritation. The texture is light and is easy to spread, there is no added fragrance, which is very important to me, it only has a faint scent of some lactic acid products I've used previously. I am very picky when it comes to skincare products, but I simply love the Retinol Reform. It is very effective and is a quality product. It is on a pricy side, but is easier to get and use than prescription retinoids."

I was so happy with this product, I went ahead and purchased all the other products in her line (cleanser, toner and moisturizer). I figured the retinol reform was so amazing, the other products had to be game changers as well. I was wrong. The toner almost undid all the work the retinol reform did in about 3 days of use. My face was breaking out terribly. I stopped using it, and my skin is almost back to looking perfect after a week. The cleanser is VERY basic. Nothing bad to say, but certainly not life changing. I thought I would love the moisturizer because it’s oil free and my skin gets greasy fast- but it contains dimethicone and you can FEEL it. That slick silicone feel- I don’t like that in a primer so I definitely don’t want it in my moisturizer. The other products will be returned. Retinol Reform is a keeper.

Encapsulation protects the integrity of the retinol as it slowly releases and enables deeper penetration, avoiding superficial skin irritation. Even though I was slightly weary of the 2.2% as it is relatively high for a retinol, I experienced no sensitivity, no retinization side effects like flaking, irritation, redness, stinging, dryness. I was able to use this every single night with no issues. I’m a seasoned retinoid user and know my skin well enough to know what I can handle. I loved the healthier glow  and hydration my skin experienced after the first week, noticeably less sebaceous filaments and keratin plugs on my nose. The added 2% Lactic acid which helps exfoliate the skin gently, while simultaneously hydrates. I loved the combination of these 2 ingredients. The texture of this is like a lightweight gel moisturizer, it absorbs rapidly. I would recommend this product for someone who wants a gentle retinol, not quite ready for a RX tretinoin. I would also repurchase and use when I’m off of RX tret as I could use SD retinol reform daily unlike my tretinoin."

Pros: I have combination skin that is extremely sensitive and reactive and had no redness or other problems with using this product almost every night, however I've been using retinol products for two years. My routine after applying a retinol cream is to follow with CereVe PM moisturizer (my go-to but to each their own) 10-20 minutes after. I never experienced any dryness.  Cons: Unfortunately, like many companies, SD doesn't tell you what the percentage of retinol is in this product. For this reason, I won't be buying it again - it's just too expensive to cross your fingers that you're getting enough for it to make a difference.   I will be going back to retinol products that list the % and hope more companies take note."

Many of the bad reviewers of this product say they broke out after a few days or that their skin didn't adjust to the product after a few weeks. If you are serious about getting on a retinol regimen and you have done your research about the topic, then you know it takes about 12 weeks of retinol treatment for a noticeable change to occur (as it takes approximately 12 weeks for your skin cells to turn over with or without retinol). My fellow retinol researchers out there also know that after beginning a retinol regimen, there is a purging period where the retinol makes all the gross stuff under your skin comes to the surface to get rid of it! After the 12-week period is over is when your skin transforms. This particular product has a higher % of retinol than most others and is also, as I said, super gentle, so you can build up to everyday use in just about a week and maximize results. The price isn't even that bad in comparison and there is enough in the bottle to last a while. I've made all my friends and family get on this retinol and I highlyyyyy recommend it."

I was able to work up to nightly use with no irritation over two weeks and every time I use it, I wake up with glowing skin. Retinol takes time to see results, and since I've incorporated this into my routine about 6 weeks ago, I do feel like my skin looks clearer and more youthful. If you are just getting into retinol, this is a wonderful, non-irritating formula to start with!"

I've always wanted to incorporate a retinol into my routine, but was always so scared of them. That was until I found retinol reform! Retinol Reform is different from other retinols because it's hydrating and doesn't cause irritation or dryness! Like AT ALL! In my opinion, its never to early to start anti-aging products! Retinol is the #1 anti-aging ingredient, besides staying out of the sun. Unlike other retinoids I have used, this product gives you short term benefits from the lactic acid that gently exfoliates your skin giving you a nice glow after only a couple uses! Along with all the long term anti-aging benefits of using a retinol. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED giving this product a try! You will not regret it!"

Never had any peeling or irritation- it helped the texture on my cheeks almost immediately and also evened out my skin tone.

So I hear you have to keep using the product in order to stop breaking out I just feel the process is way too long and not worth it in my opinion I would suggest if you’re trying to get rid of dark spots stick to something like a vitamin C more gentle because it’s not fun at all :("

For that reason, I am going to give it a score of 4 stars for now as I think it has definitely more benefits if used daily (or at least 5x/ wk min). I purchased this product after doing my research  and based on great reviews. I am in my mid 40, and was concerned with post inflammatory hyperpigmentation/dark or age spots/uneven skin tone and dullness. I have definitely seen improvement in reduction of acne breakouts(I haven’t had since starting retinol use), and since acne always caused post inflammatory hyperpigmentation on my skin, that has been a great benefit. Also the PIH I already had is definitely lighter, skin is brighter and skin is more even and smoother. Pretty good for 2-3X/week usage. Will write another review once I am using it daily.  Note: I did have to find an effective moisturizer bc my skin that has always been dry became dryer. I am using skinceuticals triple lipid and it works wonderfully with retinol!!!!  Also MUST use sunscreen daily that is at least SPF 40 and up, and use hats or not expose skin in the sun too long!!! Retinol makes your skin more sensitive to the sun.

I started breaking out worse than a 16 year old about 2 weeks in.. I was devastated, embarrassed, but forced myself to press on because I figured it was a really bad purge. After about 2 months of continual breakouts (I’ve never in my life had breakouts on my forehead until using this) I started using it just a couple days a week, still determined things would get better. Fast forward to the 4th month and I can honestly say my skin has never been worse. I never even broke out like this in my teens. Seeing as this was the only tangible change I’m giving up in hopes by skin will go back to normal. I’ve read she changed the ingredients when she made it cheaper.. sucks because I heard it used to be a good product before adding pore clogging fillers. Don’t disregard the negative reviews, a purge shouldn’t last over 6 weeks.. this product was horrible for my skin"

Similar thing happened with this product, minus the peeling. My skin was not a fan and from the breakouts that appeared the next day after using this product, I now have acne scars left over that I am trying to heal and get rid of. I know that when you use retinol initially, your skin has a period of turnover where it becomes really bad before the acne clearing, anti-aging effects of retinol really break through, but the initial period was so bad for me that I had to stop using the product.

I decided to try this one based off of the good reviews, and the ingredients. 2.2% Retinol is VERY hard to come by in Canada, so I was excited to try it as it would be one of the strongest on the market. I did not see any positive results after using it for a month, whereas the DE retinol gives rapid results within one month. The only result I’ve seen is that the product broke me out really bad. Will be returning & switching back to the other Retinol. Would not recommend"

It’s the ONLY retinol that didn’t dry me out beyond belief and cause flaking. I credit Shani with rescuing me from adult acne. However, since changing the packaging and signing a contract with Sephora, this product has been completely reformulated. All of the sudden, I’m dry, my acne has returned, my face stings and feels tender. Nothing else in my routine has changed, and purging isn’t a factor here, as I’ve been using Retinol Reform for years. I’m devastated and am hoping and praying that Shani reads these reviews and returns to her original formula. It was magical, and I’ve lost my hero product.

That this has encapsulated retinol, which is why I believe i haven’t experienced any dryness or harsh sensitivity, but ontop of this I love how this serum is almost a two in one, offering gentle exfoliating via lactic that helps the skin look so bright and even. Other ingredients that I love are the high concentration of apple fruit extract, green tea, and aloe Vera which all act as antioxidants and provide multiple vitamins and nutrients to the skin, glucosamine HCI which brightens skin and is great for pigmentation, plankton extract which helps skin maintain moisture and offers some environmental protection. Seriously amazing! •Next Application/Feel: this serum has the the texture and feel of a very light gel cream, imagine a little lighter then the youth to the people kale /spinach moisturizer, it goes on smooth and feels good on skin, not sticky at all! This is also fragrance free but the natural scent of the product has almost a sweet smell; i can’t describe it but it’s smells okay haha not bad at all and dissipates after applies on face •results: so I’ve been using this on a three times a week rotation for the last two months and all I have to say is wow, I look good lol, my skin is so smooth and bright! I also started noticing fine lines on my forehead before this serum but those have been diminished as well! •Cons of this product: when I started first using this product I did get some purging and breakouts, but after a week or so these breakouts went way and my skin became flawless.When you start a new product ESPECIALLY Retinol your skin will likely purge causing some breakouts, but no worries as they are very short lived, just stick through it unless it’s really bad then stop haha •Facts about me: I have combo-dry sensitive skin and all opinions/views are my own! :)"

I tried a test patch of Darden's retinol reform, just one cheek, and was happy that my skin didn't react. Next, I applied it to my whole face just once a week and, so far, my skin seems to be doing fine. I'm afraid to use it every night, though. I'll probably increase to 2-3 nights a week and hope I don't break out! I haven't been able to find a good retinol product that doesn't give me bad acne because they are usually full of silicones and other pore clogging ingredients. I have sensitive, oily skin and I'm 38 with some fine lines. Maybe this won't be a holy grail product, but I spent $88 on it, so I feel like I need to keep giving it a chance."

All of the closed comedones and congestion I had came to the surface, I extracted them, and as of now I have no new breakouts of cysts! Another huge bonus is the wrinkles in between my eyebrows and laugh lines are diminished. My texture is smoother than Ive ever felt. And my skin has a natural glow. I will never live without this product! This serum is strong so start out with once a week. I’m using it 3-4 times a week with no irritation.

I started out using twice a week before bed with nothing layered underneath and now I use it every other day with another serum like Estée Lauder advanced night repair.  Shani says you can use a moisturizer on top if you need added moisture but I figured I would try without to see the results. After first use I definitely noticed a difference in the pigmentation of some of my acne scars. My pores also looked less huge. I haven’t taken before and after pictures, but every time I use the product I am happy with the results. I have read that the formula has changed since it was originally formulated but I don’t know the difference as I have only tried the version after it hit Sephora.

The directions suggest using it only once or twice a week to start, and that's about all my skin can usually tolerate from some retinol products, without getting overly dry.  But this one is gentle enough to use more consistently right away.  It's only been a couple of weeks, so I'm still monitoring how my skin improves, but I like something that I can use regularly without drying out my skin too much.  And just a small amount is good for my whole face, so I think it's a good value.  I am going to try the moisturizer next."

I no longer use ANY other product but Shani’s and what she suggests. If you are looking to try a retinol or any new skin care product do not hesitate one bit to try Shani’s.  She is the real deal and great for normal, combo and oily skin types. You rarely find great skin care products for combo, normal and oily skin that do not strip your natural skins oil.  Shani’s does NOT strip natural oils at all- leaving your skin still hydrated but not producing too many oils.   I use all of her products including:  1. Face cleanser 2. Toner 3. Retinol reform 4. Moisturizer 5. Desse Pro Mask 6. Light Stim Handheld for acne"

Two years ago(or so) I messaged her on Instagram after getting diagnosed with a skin condition as a result of being put on the wrong birth control. (the skin condition was just one side effect. There were many more that I had to deal with but the skin condition is the only one that I still have to deal with today and will for the rest of my life.) I found Her on Instagram and was impressed with everything about her... I sent her a message telling her about my “situation” and just desperately asked for her help. To my surprise, she responded and was so kind but also completely honest with me. I didn’t know she had a skincare line at the time and she didn’t try to sell me it. She recommended what she thought was best for my skin... when I found out she had a skincare line..I wanted everything. Not because I necessarily thought it would work for my sensitive skin but because people like her.... I will support for as long as I possibly can. There aren’t enough people like her out there.  To see her products on Sephora now makes me so happy. It just reassures me that good things do happen to good people.

I used this product at night as indicated, it didn't irritate my skin but I generally don't have sensitive skin, so I could use it every other day. I followed with a moisturizer per instructions. The first week I already started noticing results: my skin feels more luminous, with less texture and just soft and clear and like the elasticity is improved. It is pretty amazing, I didn't think I was going to notice such a difference but I did! as far as wrinkles and fine lines go, I noticed some slight improvement at the 3 week mark, not miracles but they look better. It has an herbal scent if you care about that, but it's not a fragrance, you can tell it's from the formula itself, it's not particularly pleasant but it's not that bad either. This is a really nice product and I'm actually very impressed with the results."

I've used many retinol products in the past 2-3 years and there's nothing that I've like where I'm willing to repurchase. Everything is either too strong, too thick, or the smell is too much.

This formula also has lactic acid, which helps to brighten and smooth skin, so you get both immediate benefits and long-term results. This is amazing for those who have acne scarring, discoloration, hyperpigmentation… This not only contains retinol and lactic acid but also niacinamide which is a powerhouse at reducing discoloration.

Even sensitive skin – I just recommend starting by using it every other night and letting your skin get used to it! I also recommend switching it up after you finish your bottle as the effects aren’t as good when used month after month."

In just 2 days of use, my husband asked me why I was glowing (he never notices things - haircut? no way). In just two weeks, my skin was much brighter, tone was even, pores decreased and oil production had diminished. The before and after is crazy good. I genuinely was not expecting to see such a major difference. I use drunk elephant on the regular and I never saw such amazing results as I did with this retinol. If you can only afford 1 product in your skincare regimen, I highly recommend Shani's Retinol Reform given the long list of benefits. There is truly no retinol on the market that can match this one!"

SO far it has been working I will continue to use this for the entire month and see if it does as it promises. It is pricey but it does seem to be working."

Whether that was due to the serum, or the moisturizer I used after that (philosophy miracle worker), or just cyclic skin changes, I’m not sure. But I intend to use for 3 more weeks to see if my skin acclimates to the retinol and no longer has the small pimples."

I was frustrated so I discontinued using the product after the second day. I wanted to give the product a fair shot, so I used it again the following week.  After the first two days, I did not have any breakouts so I continued to use it for the other five days.  I have to say that I do not notice a difference in fine lines by my eyes, but my skin is tighter.  I have melasma, but the product did not seem to make any improvement to that.  It did however make my acne scars fade to be lighter in color.   The product lives up to some of its claims, but I think that there might be better products out there especially from a dermatologist."
