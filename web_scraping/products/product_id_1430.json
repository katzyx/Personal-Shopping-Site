I have sensitive combination skin, and this product felt a bit too strong for my skin. It dried my skin, and I did experience redness, itchiness, sensitivity, and even breakouts. For now, I stopped using it and will see how it will work out for my skin in the future."

It absorbs seamlessly and leaves my face feeling nourished and healthy, not tight or flaky. The real magic is in how effectively it targets fine lines, wrinkles, and sun damage. I've noticed a significant reduction in the appearance of my crow's feet and forehead creases. My skin just looks so much more plump and rejuvenated."

Following the instructions on the packaging, I used it twice the first week and three times the second week, to allow my skin to tolerate the cream. It has a lightweight texture, absorbs quickly into the skin, and I finished by applying moisturizer and, every morning, sunscreen. So far, Iu2019ve noticed smoother, firmer, and most importantly, more radiant skin. I didnu2019t experience any side effects from using this cream, so Iu2019ll continue using it for 2 more weeks to see the final results and achieve a more radiant and healthy skin. I definitely recommend it."

I was a bit concerned by the addition of AHA with retinol, but it's not an issue for me. I wake up with beautifully radiant skin, I could tell immediately there was a difference.

Yes, you may purge. You must use it correctly or yeah, you'll get irritated or dry. It's not a moisturizer! Use a cream after or do the sandwich method! Start 1-2/week then build up tolerance!

            "review_text": "Unfortunately, this was a miss for me. I REALLY wanted to like it, but ultimately returned it for two reasons. The first, was that this broke me out.  I know about the retinol purge and have never experienced it with any other retinoid products I've used, but I kept trialing this over about a 6 week period to see if the breakouts would stop. I ONLY got breakouts the morning after using this product, never on any other day. I figured that by the 4th or 5th use it would stop or wane, if it really was a purge, but it didn't.   The second reason I returned it, is because of the lack of transparency. I did some research before purchasing - it's on lots of best lists and lots of people say it brings results. But shortly after I purchased, I felt like I needed to look again. I realized that the strength or percentage of retinol in this product was nowhere to be found! I saw the brand answer this question -- they claimed that the formula and percentage was proprietary and is not shared. This made me really nervous, but I told myself: I trust Shani and her brand, and if it works, it works. But after dealing with the breakouts, I did further research and realized that it really wasn't appropriate to be using a retinoid product where I had NO CLUE about the strength/concentration of the formula. I'd have no idea how to adjust, up or down, to get to a product or formula that works for me! As someone who tries to be an informed consumer, this became a red flag that I feel I shouldn't have ignored in favor of efficacy, because there's plenty of other effective retinoids where I know what I'm getting.   I've since tried a new retinoid, a retinal, that gave me zero irritation and zero breakouts, so unfortunately I do know it was this product that was causing my issue. I would encourage this brand to let consumers know the percentage of retinol in this product. Transparency can only help your consumers, if that's what's truly important to your brand!"

Well here's the thing, I bought this back in late December, I was so scared of the above things I mentioned to happen so I never used it. And then I started to use it 2 weeks ago, and non of the 'bad' things happened also to note, I do have sensitive skin. It doesn't smell bad to me either which a few people complained about. I purchased the small one, one because the big one is in the hundreds, but also I am not using it on my entire face and I use literally a pea sized amount ONLY on my chin, every second night. So I thought the smaller one was better for my needs. The reason I rated this at 4 stars is simply because of the price, nothing else. It is an amazing product that I will be buying again!"

First, the packaging is sleek and convenient, making it easy to dispense the right amount of product without any mess. The serum itself has a lightweight and silky texture that absorbs quickly into the skin, leaving no greasy residue behind. What truly sets the Shani Darden Moisture Boost Plumping Serum apart is its plumping effect. My skin looks noticeably more supple and youthful, and fine lines around my eyes and mouth appear softened. It's like a burst of hydration that lasts throughout the day. I appreciate that this serum is suitable for all skin types, including sensitive skin. I've had no adverse reactions, redness, or breakouts since incorporating it into my routine. While the price point is higher than some other serums on the market, I believe the results justify the investment. A little goes a long way, so the bottle should last for a decent amount of time. In conclusion, this serum has become a staple in my skincare routine. If you're struggling with dryness, fine lines, or just want to give your skin a boost of hydration, I highly recommend giving this serum a try. It's a luxurious treat for your skin that delivers on its promises."

My skin is used to retinols and lactic acids, as I've been using various formulations for years so I have not experienced any peeling or major irritation.

It says it is fragrance free but I do smell a slight smell to it, but it's not bad. It has a thick consistency but it applied to my face nicely. After 3 weeks of use I have noticed my pores look smaller, especially around my nose area.  The fine lines around my eyes aren't as noticeable.  I had a friend ask what I was doing differently because she said my face looked more radiant.  I know this is pricey but it really is worth it. The bottle is heavy and feels like good quality.  I dropped it a few times and nothing broke. I have issues with fine lines and redness and I feel this product did exactly what it says it claims it does.

I started out with just one night the first week. I love how smooth my skin feels after application. This did not bother my skin at all except for making it feel a little hot the first couple times I used it!  I have worked up to using it 3-4 days a week and I absolutely love how it makes my face look and feel.  I recently lost over 100 pounds and was worried about having loose skin on my face.   After using this product I have noticed a significant tightening of my skin! My skin has taken on this young glow that I havenu2019t seen in a long time!  The only thing I did not like about the product was the smell.  Itu2019s not a bad smell just a little different. This did not effect the amazing results at all so I still give it 5 stars!

First thought was, is this workingu2026because I wasnu2019t flaking, I wasnu2019t getting raw in areas around my eyes or nose and my skin felt perfectly happy!! The 2nd week is when I noticed, my face was in a very happy place!! My skin tone looked more even, my texture was smooth and I still didnu2019t have any skin sensitivity!!! Week 3, I realize that this could be something I can use daily because my skin had zero sensitivity to it and it left my skin looking improved from where I started 3 weeks prior.

I started using twice a week and know Iu2019m using every other day. I tried to start using every day, but my skin couldnu2019t take it, it got sensitive and dry. The product is good, it spread well and itu2019s rapidly absorbed by skin. It doesnu2019t have strong smell, which I appreciate. Itu2019s not a very affordable product, but you just need a little,  it will last A couple months, probably, so it worth the price on the long term. Overall, itu2019s a good product and I hope to see more results in the future."

I received this serum free from Influenster for my honest opinion after using.  This had been on my u201cwish listu201d at Sephora for a while. This is not the first retinol Iu2019ve used but so far itu2019s the best!  Iu2019m 43 and can use all the help I can get when it comes to fine lines and brightening my skin. Iu2019ve been using for 2-3x a week at night for the last 2 months. Iu2019ve had no issues with using - no irritation. Serum is creamy & light and absorbs nicely into the skin. Sometimes I use a night time moisturizer along with it, but you donu2019t have to. When I wake up my face feels extremely smooth. Iu2019ve noticed an overall change in the texture of my skin (softer/smoother), brighter/glowing and reduction of fine lines in my forehead and neck area. Overall, Iu2019m thrilled that I got to try this and will continue to have this as part of my nighttime skincare routine!"

I have combo-leaning dry, sensitive, reactive skin. I take pretty good care of it but I have been having issues with texture on my forehead and on my cheek areas - basically beside my nose going downwards on the sides of my mouth - for years. I have wished at many times to have my oily skin back, but I reckon this is just aging. I have used a lot of different acidic products with varying degrees of success. I prefer glycolic acid over lactic but went into trying Retinol Reform with an open and hopeful mind. First, itu2019s incredibly gentle. I had zero reactions, redness, anything negative. Absorbs quick, and doesnu2019t have much of a scent. Itu2019s more moisturizing than I expected. I currently use it 4-5 nights a week and l think this is one of the, if not the, best retinol products Iu2019ve tried. The texture on my forehead is gone, and the other areas I had issue with has drastically decreased. I can see/feel a huge difference. My skin looks clearer, smoother, and feels great. The only caveat is (and maybe this is just across the board w/retinol, idk) if I donu2019t stay consistent using this, the texture slowly comes back, and my skin feels really dry and flaky. I am aware this is (for me) an expensive product, but the results are there, and I plan to keep using this. Iu2019m very pleased with the performance and have had no problem using this with my other products. I really canu2019t think of a negative, other than price, and if you donu2019t use it regularly you wonu2019t continue to see results sou2026 just keep on using it and your skin will look great! I always follow up with a moisturizer and use a spf 50 during the day if Iu2019ll be outside. Very good quality and hope to try more products from Shani Darden soon."

All the retinol products I've used before helped, but this has been almost a magic bullet. I have horrible cystic acne and I'm starting to get those crinkles around my eyes from laughing for 40 years. After 3 weeks of nightly use, my acne scars have faded, new cysts are fewer and smaller, my skin tone is more even, and my skin feels smoother and firmer. I can really see the difference, too. Nothing will ever give me flawless skin, but this is the best my skin has been since before puberty. A little goes a long way, thankfully, but you can bet your bippy I'll do what I need to in order to pay for another bottle when this one runs out.  If you have acne and wrinkles, the most unfair of all combinations, try this. You won't regret it. I certainly haven't!"

With all that said, the reason I am a huge fan of Shani Darden Retinol Reform is the incredible improvement in the fine lines around my eyes. The serum applies so smoothly and thoroughly that I feel an instant relief from the puffiness and tired look I have. I donu2019t have fine lines around my mouth so I am currently only using the Retinol Reform on my eye area. I know I will continue to use this product.

When I was sent this product I wondered, u201cWhy use an anti-aging product when Iu2019m not even 30 yet?u201d Well it turns out this was a product I didnu2019t know I needed. Prior to reading the box for this product I knew nothing about retinol which is the primary ingredient in this serum. Anti-aging products were simply well out of my realm of awareness. Retinol is known to reduce fine lines, firm and brighten skin as this product claims to do. I didnu2019t start with many fine lines though I laugh and smile a whole so I canu2019t speak for that but I can say that since incorporating this into my nightmare skincare routine, I have seen a noticeable difference in the bounce of my skin, smoothness overall and brightness. I donu2019t about retinol as a stand-alone but this product is the truth. It is a little high end ringing at $88 a bottle but whatu2019s cheaper this or a facelift? Not to mention the infrequency you use this (1-2 times a week) makes the product stretch. I started testing this product 3 weeks ago (when I took my before photo) and I just recorded my after video right before posting this. Color me impressed. I will gladly spend my money on this product when it runs out. Toodles!"

Iu2019m used to retinol products so I jumped in and started using this product nightly rather than easing in to it. So far, I havenu2019t experienced any redness, peeling, dryness, or irritation so that is a positive. The lactic acid in addition to the retinol seems to have made my skin texture a bit smoother as well. Because this retinol formula is so easy to tolerate and the lactic acid is a nice addition, I would consider this a better-than-average retinol product. It absorbs quickly and didnu2019t cause any breakouts, which is also a positive. Iu2019ll need to finish the bottle to see if there are any additional improvement in terms of fine lines, firmness, or other anti-aging benefits. Typically it would take about 6-8 weeks for a skincare product to prove effective, so I may update this after the bottle is finished to determine whether or not I will repurchase on my own."

I was thrilled to recieve this product, as I've already been using it in my daily skincare routine for about 2 years. I have super sensitive, breakout-prone skin, and was starting to notice some signs of aging (fine lines, uneven tone, lack of firmness, etc.) as I neared 40. I was nervous starting a retinol, so I started slowly, using it twice a week, and slowly building up to every day use. I did go through a tough 2 month when I started, as with many retinols your skin looks worse before it gets better. I'm glad I stuck with it, as I consider this product a staple in my skincare routine. It retails for ~$88 @sephora. Full disclosure: I also regularly get botox, have gotten filler, and have gone through four RF Microneedling (Morpheus8) treatments, so I consider my current skin to be a reflection of all of those along with this product."

It also has lactic acid great for gentle exfoliate, Niacinamide to help with skin discoloration and Aloe that helps calm and soothes skin irritation that could be caused by the retinol.

In fairness to the product, Iu2019ve only been using it for about 3 weeks, when 12 weeks is recommended. It is a very mild Retinol. It was recommended 1-2 pumps 1-2 days per week to start, followed by moisturizer. I was easily able to use it 4 times per week with no irritation. However, I do not like the smell. It is a bit mildewy and the smell lingers for a while after youu2019ve applied it. I have also not noticed any changes in my fine lines and dark spots. As I said above, I havenu2019t been using it for the full 12 weeks, but I expected to see some difference in a product at this price point. I will edit this post if I see better results in a few weeks, but right now Iu2019d only give this product 2 stars and thatu2019s mainly because itu2019s very gently on the skin."

I used it 1x the first week and 2x the second week, but noticed this week that my skin really needed a lot of moisture on the days after I used it and does feel a bit tighter and drier than normal. I was not shocked by this, since I have very sensitive skin and my skin is a bit on the drier side. However, I am hopeful that my skin will become used to it as I really think it works very well, and I'm excited to keep on using it to reduce my red/uneven skin tone and forehead lines."

Influencer sent me a free Shani Darden Retinol Reform to review at just  the right time.  Retinol is a scary word and there are safety concerns and instructions addressed on the box and witching the packaging.  I started using the product the very night I received it.  I was pleasantly surprised that my skin instantly felt firmer yet not dry or the u201cstretched to tightu201d feeling that sometimes occurs with creams.  It also didnu2019t feel as if it over compensated the dryness by leaving my skin greasy looking, it could have even been a bit more moisturizing.  Iu2019ve used the Retinol Reform for over two weeks and Iu2019m quite pleased.  My skin feels better, my uneven skin texture had improved greatly, and my fine lines are a little less noticeable.  I am excited to continue using Retinol Reform and seeing what more it can do to improve my face.  Shani Darden Skin Care made a product they should be proud of, it delivers the retinol needed for improvement without being harsh to the skin, even if your skin is a little on the sensitive side like mine, you wonu2019t be let down.

My chin had been breaking out in large red bumps are are painful and leaving scars. I don't have an issue with acne, so I contribute it to this product.

I havent sought a treatment like this for quite some time, but when I got some samples of this, I decided to give it a try. Im happy so far. I recently switched up my makeup routine for lighter formulations, so I definitely felt a little more pressured to up the ante on my exfoliation routine - I do have some stubborn textured spots. Im happy to say that after using this for a couple weeks, my makeup looks so much smoother(!) on my face now. Im not sure if I could have achieved that look without it.

This serum helps reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkle by boosting collagen production. It also brightens and smooths the skin.  I noticed changes in my skin on the second day as  my skin appeared brighter and had a more youthful appearance. By the 4th day I was shook when my skin looked tighter, smoother and a glow from within. Also, my face had a glow to it. This formula is free of Paraben, Phthalates, Gluten, Oils, Sulfates, Fragrances. Also, cruelty-free and vegan. This product has been awarded the Luxury Beauty Award in 2020 by Town and Country and the 2020 Clean Beauty award by Allure. The only Con I see is that the claims of the amount of renitnol do not seem supported by the ingredient list.  I was extremely skeptical about this product as the reviews seemed more like myth than what could be true.  But the reviews are fact.  Get this and give it a try!"

But my dermatologist recommended that I should try again using retinol and I said I'll think about it because of the disappointment in the past. So I asked some friends what's the best retinol with my skin concerns and I received so many recommendations that I got overwhelmed. I received a sample and was hesitant to go through another frustrating experience but I said you only live once and tried Shani Darden Retinol reform and this is by far the best retinol serum on the skincare market. I've notice my fine lines reduce and smooth and some of my dark spots faded tremendously. There is no scent, easy to apply on your freshly cleanse face and a little goes a long way. I use it 3x times a week I don't want to over do it even though it's doing wonders for my skin. Overall a great product I didn't experience drying my skin out or redness and especially no breakouts Hallelujah. My skin is glowing, clear, smooth and looking younger. I'm thankful for this product and this is a must have in your skin care routine."

Itu2019s a prescription and can run you upwards of $250 so hopefully you have a drug plan but Iu2019m telling you - I tried everything and I mean EVERYTHING including breast milk, garlic, retinols etc. and nothing works like TACTUPUMP.

The gel-cream texture of this serum feels so cool against my skin and absorbs like a dream. When used on its own, it leaves behind zero residue feeling or greasiness. When used with certain other products in my night routine it doesn't mix well and create a face full of jelly ball pilling that looks and feels, um, gross. Keep that in mind! I wish brands would list ingredients that may possibly react badly with other ingredients! Overall though, I definitely like the results I'm getting so far and will continue to use my Retinol Reform every single night. It takes about 4 weeks of consistent use to see real visible results."

Itu2019s not immediate abs comes with a few weeks use, but definitely happens if you stick with it for the long haul. Give it a try it may work for you too!"

It made my skin MUCH brighter and my complexion started evening out. I have really bad sun damage on my face but this stuff has lightened my dark sun spots in a really noticeable way. Just look at my before and after pictures. This cream is lightweight and non-greasy. It didn't burn or irritate my skin. It didn't dry it out either. Honestly it's one of the best most effective Retinol products that I've ever used. I definitely recommend it."

To this day I have not been able to find another product that did the same. I was thrilled! Plus, it didn't take long to begin to actually see more changes. My skin simply looked better... healthier. Shani Darden's Retinol Reform Serum is truly remarkable. It does not contain parabens, gluten, fragrances or surface oils. All of this contributing to reduce the visible signs of aging. I believe this serum is best used at night, on clean & dried skin before evening moisturizing. I strongly suggest to any and everyone who has anti-aging issues to try this. It did not disappoint me and I don't think it will you either!"

That being said, do I think it's worth the price? Meh. I moved on to another brand (starting low and slow) and I've had way better results in the first 4 weeks of using the new brand. The new retinol is also less expensive with decades of research and data to back it up. I do think this product is worth it for maintenance purposes and would repurchase in the future for use in the warmer months and reserve my stronger retinol for the winter."

I have noticed my skin tone looks more even and, while I don't have many fine lines, those I do have appear softened. I was not able to scale up my usage, however, due to dryness. This could be caused by the unseasonably cold weather and the effect of constantly running the heather to stay warm. I have tried to increase my use of the humidifier to offset this but could still only tolerate 2x per week. I liked how easy it was to smooth on my skin and did not find the product to be greasy. I do not suffer from breakouts in general and did not have any problems with acne while using this product. I would probably purchase again, maybe in warmer weather and especially if they offered a more moisturizing version."

I think it helped my texture more than any other product I've used in the past, perhaps that's the lactic acid in it, but it's nice to have it already in this so I don't have to purchase and use an additional product. I cant honestly say that I've noticed an improvement in any existing spots because I've been using azealic acid for about 2 months before I started using this and I didn't notice any additional improvement from what I had been seeing with the azealic acid already. as for anti aging, fine lines are not currently an issue so I had nothing to compare to before. with all that said this does have a high price point BUT they offer a deluxe sample size that offers what I think is more than enough to see if it will work for you before committing to a larger, pricier size."

BUT what I do love is that it's not overly fragrant. This doesn't feel perfumey at all... might just be the smell from all the ingredients combined. Overall I would recommend it and will continue to apply it to my skin for longer lasting results."

This is a first for my skin while using a new retinol product.  I can't speak to the sun sensitivity because it was far too cold to spend much time outside.

I'm very pleased with how it performs but since I am new to the product I don't know if the fragrance free feature is a real thing or if the product I got was rancid because it smelled like an old perfume that has been sitting on your granny's table for years, thats how i can describe and it did not harm my eyes or anything so I've kept using it but I think I will forever wonder what should it really smell like... or not smell like.

If you are looking for an effective retinol cream, this one is definitely effective, The only reason I did not rate it a full 5 stars is because I think the price is too high for the amount you receive - you only need a small amount, and that small amount goes a long way, but $88/1 oz is very steep.

On non retinol nights I tend to use AHA serums, for the chemical exfoliation. I love having the option of using a more gentle retinol formula that includes AHAs... this is where Retinol Reform steps in. Reform is a more gentle formula, but still very effective. I love alternating Reform with a stronger retinol formula throughout the week. And Reform having AHA chemical exfoliants is a huge plus! My skin tolerates Reform well, Iu2019ve never had a negative reaction or irritation. After using I wake up to smoother and brighter skin. This product is on the pricier side but itu2019s a lovely formula and a definite repurchase for me. Love that Shani offers a smaller size to trial for only $30. For reference I am 43 with sensitive combo/dry skin."

The new formula - lacking that magic that took Shani to the top. The ingredient list is double the size and retinol is pushed further down the list, I can't use it around my eyes anymore as I got horrible dry, scaly patches and some on my forehead as well. I was in such denial I blamed it on every other product except shani's because I was that sure she wouldn't do us like that. I still use the product and I'm giving it a 4 because it's still a good product but it's the same as every other retinol now. Sigh* I wish people would stop messing with beautiful formulas just to make it mainstream. I would've paid double the price if she had kept the OG ingredient list and sold as an independent retailer.

I noticed my skin significantly brighter after just a couple uses(twice per week to be exact & what is recommended), and within a few more uses I noticed the smaller, fine lines/wrinkles diminishing on my cheeks and forehand. Thank God. Overall SO much smoother. I am interested to try more products from this brand. It is rather pricey, but you can't complain much, when a product actually works like this!

I turned 50 in July 2020. Unfortunately I didn't notice any difference in my complexion after using this product for several weeks. I was very surprised because I have had success with other products. This seems to have worked wonders for some people. Just didn't do the trick for me for some reason. Glad I was able to try the sample without spending a fortune on the full size. Hope other people have success with this item.

I think the price is a little high for what it does, given that I can get an actual prescriptive retinoid for about the same price."

Serum:  Super Bounce by glossier its Hyaluronic acid w/ vitamin B5  5. Shani Darden Retinol Reform  6. Youth to the people super berry hydrate and glow sleep mask.  If your'e not a sleep mask person you can follow up with your serum again, then a couple dabs of your moisturizer. Then Night Night :)  This product is a marathon not a race. You'll start seeing changes over time. Buy the smaller size to give it a try!"

I was so happy with this product, I went ahead and purchased all the other products in her line (cleanser, toner and moisturizer). I figured the retinol reform was so amazing, the other products had to be game changers as well. I was wrong. The toner almost undid all the work the retinol reform did in about 3 days of use. My face was breaking out terribly. I stopped using it, and my skin is almost back to looking perfect after a week. The cleanser is VERY basic. Nothing bad to say, but certainly not life changing. I thought I would love the moisturizer because itu2019s oil free and my skin gets greasy fast- but it contains dimethicone and you can FEEL it. That slick silicone feel- I donu2019t like that in a primer so I definitely donu2019t want it in my moisturizer. The other products will be returned. Retinol Reform is a keeper.

Encapsulation protects the integrity of the retinol as it slowly releases and enables deeper penetration, avoiding superficial skin irritation. Even though I was slightly weary of the 2.2% as it is relatively high for a retinol, I experienced no sensitivity, no retinization side effects like flaking, irritation, redness, stinging, dryness. I was able to use this every single night with no issues. Iu2019m a seasoned retinoid user and know my skin well enough to know what I can handle. I loved the healthier glow  and hydration my skin experienced after the first week, noticeably less sebaceous filaments and keratin plugs on my nose. The added 2% Lactic acid which helps exfoliate the skin gently, while simultaneously hydrates. I loved the combination of these 2 ingredients. The texture of this is like a lightweight gel moisturizer, it absorbs rapidly. I would recommend this product for someone who wants a gentle retinol, not quite ready for a RX tretinoin. I would also repurchase and use when Iu2019m off of RX tret as I could use SD retinol reform daily unlike my tretinoin."

Pros: I have combination skin that is extremely sensitive and reactive and had no redness or other problems with using this product almost every night, however I've been using retinol products for two years. My routine after applying a retinol cream is to follow with CereVe PM moisturizer (my go-to but to each their own) 10-20 minutes after. I never experienced any dryness.  Cons: Unfortunately, like many companies, SD doesn't tell you what the percentage of retinol is in this product. For this reason, I won't be buying it again - it's just too expensive to cross your fingers that you're getting enough for it to make a difference.   I will be going back to retinol products that list the % and hope more companies take note."

Many of the bad reviewers of this product say they broke out after a few days or that their skin didn't adjust to the product after a few weeks. If you are serious about getting on a retinol regimen and you have done your research about the topic, then you know it takes about 12 weeks of retinol treatment for a noticeable change to occur (as it takes approximately 12 weeks for your skin cells to turn over with or without retinol). My fellow retinol researchers out there also know that after beginning a retinol regimen, there is a purging period where the retinol makes all the gross stuff under your skin comes to the surface to get rid of it! After the 12-week period is over is when your skin transforms. This particular product has a higher % of retinol than most others and is also, as I said, super gentle, so you can build up to everyday use in just about a week and maximize results. The price isn't even that bad in comparison and there is enough in the bottle to last a while. I've made all my friends and family get on this retinol and I highlyyyyy recommend it."

This formula uses a stable 2.2% Encapsulated Retinol combined with 2% lactic acid to boost collagen and cell turnover.   This is the SMOOTHEST retinol that has ever graced my face. I had previously alternated between two other retinol. One had a thick chalky feeling and the other left my face feeling burned with just 1% retinol. Both are super popular brands and so I thought maybe it was just my skin.   When I saw this was 2% I thought maybe it would be too strong for my skin but Shandi's formula was perfect. The stability of her encapsulated retinol make it easy for my skin to tolerate. Check out how emolient it is in my pictures, it just glides across your face. No stinging, burning or peeling."

Retinol Reform is different from other retinols because it's hydrating and doesn't cause irritation or dryness! Like AT ALL! In my opinion, its never to early to start anti-aging products! Retinol is the #1 anti-aging ingredient, besides staying out of the sun. Unlike other retinoids I have used, this product gives you short term benefits from the lactic acid that gently exfoliates your skin giving you a nice glow after only a couple uses! Along with all the long term anti-aging benefits of using a retinol. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED giving this product a try! You will not regret it!"

Then slowly the surface stuff, sandpapery feeling of every pore being filled with junk started to get less and less.   Im now up to using tgis every other night and my skin is actually developing a glow. Still no major deep breakouts, but still working through some surface stuff.   This is the third retinol ive tried and ive never had such success. This doesnt ever leave my skin scorched and extremely fragile. No flakies.

For that reason, I am going to give it a score of 4 stars for now as I think it has definitely more benefits if used daily (or at least 5x/ wk min). I purchased this product after doing my research  and based on great reviews. I am in my mid 40, and was concerned with post inflammatory hyperpigmentation/dark or age spots/uneven skin tone and dullness. I have definitely seen improvement in reduction of acne breakouts(I havenu2019t had since starting retinol use), and since acne always caused post inflammatory hyperpigmentation on my skin, that has been a great benefit. Also the PIH I already had is definitely lighter, skin is brighter and skin is more even and smoother. Pretty good for 2-3X/week usage. Will write another review once I am using it daily.  Note: I did have to find an effective moisturizer bc my skin that has always been dry became dryer. I am using skinceuticals triple lipid and it works wonderfully with retinol!!!!  Also MUST use sunscreen daily that is at least SPF 40 and up, and use hats or not expose skin in the sun too long!!! Retinol makes your skin more sensitive to the sun.

Fast forward to the 4th month and I can honestly say my skin has never been worse. I never even broke out like this in my teens. Seeing as this was the only tangible change Iu2019m giving up in hopes by skin will go back to normal. Iu2019ve read she changed the ingredients when she made it cheaper.. sucks because I heard it used to be a good product before adding pore clogging fillers. Donu2019t disregard the negative reviews, a purge shouldnu2019t last over 6 weeks.. this product was horrible for my skin"

Similar thing happened with this product, minus the peeling. My skin was not a fan and from the breakouts that appeared the next day after using this product, I now have acne scars left over that I am trying to heal and get rid of. I know that when you use retinol initially, your skin has a period of turnover where it becomes really bad before the acne clearing, anti-aging effects of retinol really break through, but the initial period was so bad for me that I had to stop using the product.  I have sensitive combo skin and would not recommend this."

However, since changing the packaging and signing a contract with Sephora, this product has been completely reformulated.

Nothing else in my routine has changed, and purging isnu2019t a factor here, as Iu2019ve been using Retinol Reform for years.

That this has encapsulated retinol, which is why I believe i havenu2019t experienced any dryness or harsh sensitivity, but ontop of this I love how this serum is almost a two in one, offering gentle exfoliating via lactic that helps the skin look so bright and even. Other ingredients that I love are the high concentration of apple fruit extract, green tea, and aloe Vera which all act as antioxidants and provide multiple vitamins and nutrients to the skin, glucosamine HCI which brightens skin and is great for pigmentation, plankton extract which helps skin maintain moisture and offers some environmental protection. Seriously amazing! u2022Next Application/Feel: this serum has the the texture and feel of a very light gel cream, imagine a little lighter then the youth to the people kale /spinach moisturizer, it goes on smooth and feels good on skin, not sticky at all! This is also fragrance free but the natural scent of the product has almost a sweet smell; i canu2019t describe it but itu2019s smells okay haha not bad at all and dissipates after applies on face u2022results: so Iu2019ve been using this on a three times a week rotation for the last two months and all I have to say is wow, I look good lol, my skin is so smooth and bright! I also started noticing fine lines on my forehead before this serum but those have been diminished as well! u2022Cons of this product: when I started first using this product I did get some purging and breakouts, but after a week or so these breakouts went way and my skin became flawless.When you start a new product ESPECIALLY Retinol your skin will likely purge causing some breakouts, but no worries as they are very short lived, just stick through it unless itu2019s really bad then stop haha u2022Facts about me: I have combo-dry sensitive skin and all opinions/views are my own! :)"

This came recommended and I'm loving it better than all the ones my dermatologists have given me in the past. In 6 weeks, the sunspots on my face have faded significantly, my skin is smoother and brighter, and it has helped zap incoming acne! I noticed that thicker lines on my forehead have faded, but can't speak to fine lines, as I haven't seen a difference there yet. I use it every day or every other day (depending on whether I use a Vitamin C serum or AHA/BHA products). For reference, I don't have sensitive skin and I am very acclimated to retinol use. If you're just starting to use retinol, I would not use it as often and def wear SPF! Note: I had some problems getting the pump on the mini size to work at first, have to twist it a few times."

I tried a test patch of Darden's retinol reform, just one cheek, and was happy that my skin didn't react. Next, I applied it to my whole face just once a week and, so far, my skin seems to be doing fine. I'm afraid to use it every night, though. I'll probably increase to 2-3 nights a week and hope I don't break out! I haven't been able to find a good retinol product that doesn't give me bad acne because they are usually full of silicones and other pore clogging ingredients. I have sensitive, oily skin and I'm 38 with some fine lines. Maybe this won't be a holy grail product, but I spent $88 on it, so I feel like I need to keep giving it a chance."

Another huge bonus is the wrinkles in between my eyebrows and laugh lines are diminished. My texture is smoother than Ive ever felt. And my skin has a natural glow. I will never live without this product! This serum is strong so start out with once a week. Iu2019m using it 3-4 times a week with no irritation. I use the Saint Jane CBD serum and a night cream over top in the PM. Make sure you use SPF during the day as well! Iu2019m going to try her oil free moisturizer next."

I use one pump after cleansing I spread it into 4 dots on my face (forehead, cheeks, and chin) and circular massage it in. My acne does simmer down and I really do enjoy the results. I use it every other night in the evening. I can't buy this product every two weeks so I try ration it out and my skin is maintained. I would recommend and stock up when you have a Sephora coupon."

It is worth noting that the pump is very good, and you can pump it so gently that you don't waste product if you want less than a full pump. Even after such a short time I know this stuff is the real thing! I am most critical of the fine lines under my eyes and I find they're even more defined when I wear make up. This has made a noticeable difference. I honestly can't wait to see the results after a couple of months. The best new product I've tried in a long time and I buy a lot!"

I have acne prone skin, and acne scarring not many wrinkles but preventative measures are always nice. I started out using twice a week before bed with nothing layered underneath and now I use it every other day with another serum like Estu00e9e Lauder advanced night repair.  Shani says you can use a moisturizer on top if you need added moisture but I figured I would try without to see the results. After first use I definitely noticed a difference in the pigmentation of some of my acne scars. My pores also looked less huge. I havenu2019t taken before and after pictures, but every time I use the product I am happy with the results. I have read that the formula has changed since it was originally formulated but I donu2019t know the difference as I have only tried the version after it hit Sephora.   I took off 1 star because for the price of the product I feel like there are other retinolu2019s on the market (like Sunday Riley that offer 6.5%) that offer more bang for your buck.  Friendly reminder to always use an SPF during the day if you are using a retinol :-)"

Neither texture reform or retinol reform ever irritated or dried out my skin. The biggest changes in my skin that I noticed from using these products was how much they helped with TEXTURE and ACNE, fine lines and wrinkles also! Whenever I would run low on this product and have to wait a few days to receive another in the mail - I could immediately tell in my skin. This product is 100% a holy grail!  If youu2019re more sensitive or havenu2019t used retinol before, Shani recommends starting slowly with her texture reform.

I used this product at night as indicated, it didn't irritate my skin but I generally don't have sensitive skin, so I could use it every other day. I followed with a moisturizer per instructions. The first week I already started noticing results: my skin feels more luminous, with less texture and just soft and clear and like the elasticity is improved. It is pretty amazing, I didn't think I was going to notice such a difference but I did! as far as wrinkles and fine lines go, I noticed some slight improvement at the 3 week mark, not miracles but they look better. It has an herbal scent if you care about that, but it's not a fragrance, you can tell it's from the formula itself, it's not particularly pleasant but it's not that bad either. This is a really nice product and I'm actually very impressed with the results."

It also absorbs/dries pretty quickly. It has a mild syrupy smell but nothing unbearable. I'm at the age where wrinkles are inevitable so I'm hoping the Shani Darden Retinol Reform will help to slow it down a little. I've used many retinol products in the past 2-3 years and there's nothing that I've like where I'm willing to repurchase. Everything is either too strong, too thick, or the smell is too much. This retinol reform seems like the perfect balance, especially for my oily acne prone skin, I don't need anything too harsh or thick that it will clog my pores"

Only downside is that I had to work up to using it so frequently and the initial couple of weeks was a bit harder because it was drying out my sensitive skin so I started using it a bit less to build up tolerance more gradually. That being said, my skin is super fussy and sensitive, and I haven't had any issues with my skin other than building up a tolerance to be able to use this product more frequently. It's seriously such an amazing feeling to be able to walk so confident in my skin that I don't even bother putting on makeup. Thank goodness for retinol reform :)"

I havenu2019t noticed a drastic difference other than increased smoothness overall. However I am decking one star because I think my skin may have had a slight negative reaction to it as i had noticed a few small pimples that cropped up on my cheek. Whether that was due to the serum, or the moisturizer I used after that (philosophy miracle worker), or just cyclic skin changes, Iu2019m not sure. But I intend to use for 3 more weeks to see if my skin acclimates to the retinol and no longer has the small pimples."

I do have oily skin, but I do not usually have breakouts like that, especially at the same time. The smell was something that also bothered me.  It is odd yet subtle but  not very pleasing. I was frustrated so I discontinued using the product after the second day. I wanted to give the product a fair shot, so I used it again the following week.  After the first two days, I did not have any breakouts so I continued to use it for the other five days.  I have to say that I do not notice a difference in fine lines by my eyes, but my skin is tighter.  I have melasma, but the product did not seem to make any improvement to that.  It did however make my acne scars fade to be lighter in color.   The product lives up to some of its claims, but I think that there might be better products out there especially from a dermatologist."
