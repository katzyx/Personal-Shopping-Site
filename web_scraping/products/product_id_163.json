I needed A LOT of shampoo to feel clean and the conditioner didn't give me that silky slip feeling. The packaging looks nice, but the conditioner needs to be in an upside down bottle, the conditioner is very thick. After washing, my hair didn't look or feel special in any way, I want to say it felt a little weighed down too. I have plenty of other products I would rather use, so I passed this set along to my husband. Honestly I would rather have thrown it away, but it was too expensive to just toss."

			"review_text": "I’ve been using this shampoo and conditioner for 3 weeks now and it’s an absolute waste of money! The shampoo is so diluted and doesn’t even emulsify - it doesn’t feel like my scalp gets cleaned and I always have to shampoo my hair 3 times! My hair gets tangled easily and I also notice more hair fall after using this shampoo. People have commented that they like the smell of the shampoo, it doesn’t smell bad, but I honestly don’t find it mind-blowing. In fact, it leaves my hair smelling stale the next day and I still feel greasy!   As for the conditioner, it doesn’t feel like there’s any added benefit except it’s more costly for the price point if you get the bundle. It’s almost impossible to squeeze the conditioner out due to the design of the bottle. Definitely a frustrating shower routine and I do not recommend getting this product!"

I had to go back to washing my hair every single day when I had been able to keep an every-other-day routine with other shampoos. For the price, the hairloss and the unfulfilled claims of helping with excess scalp oil production, I can confidently say after 3 months of constant use that this set is an absolute waste of money. They smell good though."

However the products lathers well, smells good, and leaves hair feeling super clean. It didnt leave my hair feeling dry or caused hairloss as other say in their review.

My hair is normally VERY thick and dense and tends to be oily at the roots and dry from mids-ends. This duo was incredibly stripping and drying, made my scalp itch like crazy, and after using half the bottle I noticed some pretty major thinning/balding in patches of my hair. I used to have major issues with frizz and dry ends that were resolved but came back after using this. Luckily the thinning isn’t super noticeable because of how dense my natural healthy hair is but it’s still concerning. I’m throwing the rest out and won’t be repurchasing. I’ve never had this issue with other products before so I thought I was crazy until I saw other negative reviews saying similar things."

Wonderful shampoo and conditioner set, shampoo smells so good, lathers nicely and cleans the hair really well. Conditioner really good too, let it sit for a while to soak and then wash it out, leaves the hair really soft when washing it out. Great duo, happy I bought it. Usually I have the banana briogeo duo but for a while been wanting to try this set, so last week bought it, as it sounds delicious, and sure enough, works great. Leaves hair nice and clean, smelling good. Only downside is BRIOGEO you need to stop having those terrible seals on your shampoo's and conditioners, cause tonight, I obviously didn't think to check if there was a tab on top of both, until I used them, and theres a cover on top, you need to change that style of seal cause it is sooooo tough to get off, to the point, i got out of the shower, and used a tool to get it open which didn't work, only cut my finger.. cried, then got scissors to cut it. Please change the seal  thing. Otherwise, good duo."

It's so thick that it's difficult to get it out of the bottle, you'll need to store it upside down to use it. For me, this shampoo caused way worse dandruff, flakes, and oily scalp than what I already had. I also developed a rash on my neck which went away as soon as I stopped using this, so I must be allergic to something in it. I'm leaving two stars because it's not Briogeo's fault that I'm allergic to something (!!!), the packaging is adorable, the scent is fine, and maybe for others this will be fine.

I purchased this shampoo and have used it for a month now. The smell itself is amazing and my hair feels nice and soft but it makes my hair oily after just 1 day! At this point I’m spending more money on dry shampoo than anything else! If your hair is on the oily side I wouldn’t recommend this product!"

I try to wash my hair every other day as I have thin fine hair so that is basically the longest I can go before it starts to look greasy. I typically rotate shampoos each time to help prevent build up. When I use this shampoo and conditioner, my hair starts looking greasy on day one. I've been trying to use it up so I'm using it every wash at this point because it is expensive so I refuse to just ditch it. Will not buy again, definitely not worth the price point."

It smells amazing and I feel like my hair looks so much better than it did when I was using the drunk elephant shampoo and conditioner (do not recommend those). My hair is not frizzy anymore and is so much shinier. Overall, I think if you have a pretty normal scalp you will like this. If you have very oily hair, you may want to try something else."

My scalp tends to get oily after a day but using this I can go an extra day or two without a wash. The conditioner isn’t super hydrating if you’re like me and have dryer ends from highlighting and heat styling- but it still does a good job in conditioning and keeping it tangle free. When I haven’t washed my hair in a few days I have to shampoo twice but that’s what I usually do anyways with any shampoo. It leaves my scalp and hair feeing super clean and light but not dehydrated/stripped. I’ve got about 1/4 of the bottle left and it should last me the rest of the month. I purchased this back in late August so this bottle will have lasted at least 3 months.   I’d also give this an extra star for the scent. I am not someone who likes to wear fruity scents but this does smell amazing. It kind of reminds me of something from The Body Shop but this is a lot more softer, clean and elegant to me and not at all overbearing yet the scent is long lasting on the hair. I love how my hair smells and wish there were other Briogeo styling products such as a dry shampoo with this scent.   I look forward to trying other products from this brand!!"

I didn’t notice much of a soapy smell but what someone calls soapy, I could call clean smelling. The shampoo has a nice lather, and as I mentioned it didn’t feel stiff or brittle after washing but definitely clean. The conditioner is thick, almost feels like body butter but my hair was soft, and not weighed down. Might not do what it claims but it’s still pretty great and it lasted about 3.5 months so I’ll call it a win"

The positives stop there. It made my oily hair so much worse. Even when only using it every two days (as recommended by Briogeo - I work out a lot and don't like to go very long between washes), my hair was disgustingly greasy as soon as 8 hours after I washed it, and I took time to ensure it was rinsed out really well. The conditioner is so chunky that it's difficult to get out of the bottle, it also turned the bottom of my shower into an oil slick. I will be returning this and absolutely will not repurchase it at any cost. I even washed my hair with clarifying shampoo to try to deal with the excess oil and residue created, and it barely helped. It's really frustrating that this shampoo is recommended for oily scalps, but in fact makes the problem even worse."

			"review_text": "This set was the first Briogeo shampoo/conditioner product I've ever tried; the other lines never appealed to me, but when I saw this released, I knew I wanted to try it.  First, about the cleaning smell - yes, if you smell it straight from the bottle, it has a cleaning product smell, but once you use it in the shower, it smells like the true scent of mango and cherry. I personally smell more mango than cherry, but I still like it. That said, if you don't like fruity smells, you may not like this, as it does linger in your hair after a shower for a while. It's not sickeningly sweet, but it might not be for everyone.  Performance wise, my hair isn't crazy oily, but would start to visibly get dirty by the second day with other shampoos I have used. With this one, I'm able to stretch to the third day and can take it a fourth day with dry shampoo.  The conditioner is great too and leaves my hair feeling silky. I followed the instructions the first time I used this and applied it to my roots as well, and it didn't weigh my hair down or make it feel oily at all. Just left my hair feeling soft and healthy from root to tip.  Overall,  I like this and recommend it. I enjoy trying new hair products every so often, so I'm not going to declare it as holy grail status right now, but I'll definitely keep it in my rotation."

The smell is like a fruity Vacay cocktail or smoothie but it’s not overpowering to me. As far as how it works, Like other true “clean” shampoos it does not lather into a foam and a small amount goes along way and you need to work it in and rinse really good otherwise it will feel heavy and you waste product. Overall, It made my hair feel clean, refreshed and super soft and I have long thick fine hair, that’s dyed red, that I flat iron with heat protection every day, and that I only wash every 3 days.

What they really mean is that you’ll be oily and greasy after just one day. I have fine straight hair that can get greasy pretty quickly. After a long time, I’ve managed to train my hair to go 3 days with no wash. I only tried out this product because they discontinued the original stuff I was using so I’m on the hunt for a new shampoo/conditioner. I tried this out for 2 months. After washing my hair and letting it dry, I could feel how heavy this product is. It’s never a good sign when you can feel product literally weighing down your hair. Made my already flat fine hair even flatter and by the next morning full head of grease. Kept on using it though because I thought maybe it was only like this since I just started using it. But it was exactly the same the entire time. Never got better, never “oil controlled,” just nothing but flat greasy hair."

My hair is fine in texture and I found this set was the perfect balance of cleaning my hair and moisturizing it enough so that it wasn’t super frizzy and dry. My scalp feels nice and clean, but not itchy and irritated like if it was too strong of a clean. I did follow the conditioner with some of the superfoods mask on just my ends for a few minutes, and I found that to be super hydrating and a nice addition to this set. Overall, my hair looks shinier and smoother now that it’s dried. I think if you have combo hair like me (oily scalp, dry ends) I would try this out! If you have super dry ends just add in a little bit of the mask after you condition and it’s perfect. I will probably alternate this set with a hydrating set every other wash."

Unfortunately, for me and my hair, this was a super duper huge miss. The scent is VERY strong - it smells quite cloyingly sweet and kind of like if I had eaten a handful of mango and cherry taffies together. This is also very expensive. $49 for shampoo and conditioner of this small size is quite high.  Smell and price aside. This absolutely killed my hair. I tried it for a week, but I had to stop because my hair started falling out and my hair was getting to be very strawlike while washing it. Maybe it overstripped my hair's oils? Maybe my hair isn't oily enough for this shampoo? I don't know. All I know is my hair became very stiff and brittle feeling, which is opposite of my very soft hair. So, that scared me (especially with the hair loss). On top of these issues, my scalp also became extremely itchy. I think it's maybe because of all the extracts and things in here, but all I know is that I've never been a scalp itcher, but it was so uncomfortable that I felt myself scratching my scalp in public...a lot.  Again, maybe my hair isn't oily enough for this product. I would not repurchase this product, even at a discounted price."

That is what real cherry and mango would smell like if thrown in a blender. It smells great, in my opinion. As for how it works, it’s definitely more cleansing than their other shampoos hence it is for oil control. The conditioner feels lovely as always."

I have straight, fine to medium hair and wash my hair 1-2 times a week depending on how active I am and my scalp doesn’t get very oily but also isn’t dry. I have recently highlighted hair so my hair has gone from healthy as can be to partially bleached and now requires a little more tlc.   When I apply this on my hair it actually made my hair tangled up so I wasn’t veryHappy about that but I lathered through and rinsed it off. I followed it up with a briogio super foods balancing Conditioner the conditioner is a very thick consistency and milky orange in color. I applied the conditioner starting from my end and worked my way up and oh Em Gee this melted right into my hair and began detangling my strands. I lathered the conditioner through my ends and my hair felt immediately softer and I was able to run my fingers through it while wet.   I was able to wash my hair on my usual schedule and the products did not weigh my hair down."

It smells kind of like orange Starburst (in a good way) and leaves my hair silky and shiny and it stayed de-tangled for multiple days!  My only complaint, and maybe because I just got use to Olaplex for so long, the shampoo is very watery; I have to use a lot more than I use to to get a nice lather so it probably won’t last me as long as Olaplex did. Not sure if the shampoo is worth the money, but the conditioner definitely is.  (For reference my hair is hip-length, medium thickness, and very straight.

It does control oil HOWEVER (this brings me to my major issue) it absolutely STRIPPED my hair. It left it so unbelievably dry and tangled I could not even get my comb through it, I had to get back in the shower and use a different conditioner to get a comb back through my hair.

The shampoo is a very thin consistency and I needed a lot of shampoo to get a lather. The instructions advise to vigorously massage for 30 seconds to build lather but with the usual amount of shampoo I use it barely created any lather, so I had to go back and add more twice to get a low-medium lather. At this rate I think I will go through it quickly. The conditioner was thick, left it on for a few minutes and it didn’t do anything for detangling. Honestly don’t think it did anything. My hair is clean, but not noticing anything special. Based on my experience I think this set is overpriced and not doing anything to balance oil production. I still wash my hair every 2-3 days and use dry shampoo in between."

This kit has great ingredients, no sulfates, silicones, no parabens, and rich in nature extract. The shampoo looks like a bottle of juice, the condition looks like a smoothie. Both of them smell great. Keeping it away from kids, they probably will eat it. The shampoo has richer foam than other silicone-free shampoos. After using the set, my hair and scalp feel clean and smooth. The scent last 5 hours after my hair dry."

All I can say is WOW!! This set is everything I've been searching for to give my hair exactly what its been needing. As soon as i popped open the tops of these bottles, i was instantly in heaven with the delicious smell. The scent reminds me of being in a tropical paradise, with the smell of fresh fruits surrounding me. My hair seriously smells incredible and the scent actually lasts for days. After every wash, my hair felt silky smooth and soft, and looked so luxurious. My natural curls sprang to life, looking bouncier and so much fuller. My scalp felt cleaner than ever and it took all the oiliness and grime away. I love that I dont have to wash my hair so often now thanks to this duo. Plus they are vegan and clean haircare products which is always a huge plus for me. My hair drinks up these fruit smoothies and is loving every second of it. Highly recommend these haircare products for any hair type, but especially for people with oily hair.   Thank you @briogeo for gifting me this amazing set."

I have been using both the shampoo and conditioner each time I take a shower and I have been loving it. The shampoo lathers very well, you only need a little bit. The conditioner is so soothing on your hair, you can tell when applying it how conditioning it is. I always towel dry my hair and let my hair dry on its own. Usually my hair tends to me frizzy where I have to use extra products and heat to tame it. Since using the conditioner and shampoo on my hair, my hair is no longer frizzy. My hair is so much more smoother, softer to the touch, and healthier looking. There is no more frizz and it has a great amount of volume/bounce to it. Very pleased with this set. Highly recommend.

I have fine, straight, slightly dry hair and it can easily get weighed down with the other styling products that I often use.  The shampoo from the set is slightly clarifying without actually being stripping and makes my hair feel quite clean.  It may prove slightly drying for those with severely dry hair but for those with normal and especially oily hair or hair that tends to be prone to product buildup, I can see how this would work out very well.  The matching conditioner is the perfect moisturizing accompaniment to the shampoo because it adds back hydration without actually making my hair feel weighed down and in fact my hair feels soft and slightly bouncy after using the duo.  I'm really happy to keep using both because they seem to agree with my hair type and work really well so I'm happy to have discovered the set and will actually probably repurchase once I've finished what I have."

So both the shampoo and conditioner smell heavenly with mango, cherry, and papaya shining through to help balance oil production on your scalp. I personally love heavily scented hair products, but if you don't these may be be a little overwhelming for you. After using both products my hair felt happy, healthy and hydrated BUT I can't say I adored using the products themselves. Both the shampoo and conditioner's consistencies were just enough off to be annoying. The shampoo was too thin and watery causing too much product to come out at a time while the conditioner was too thick making it a struggle to get enough product out. While I adore that these products are free from sulfates, silicones, parabens, etc. I wonder if lacking these ingredients is the reason I didn't experience a super deep clean with the shampoo. Despite my minor issues with them, I really did enjoy the effect this duo had on my hair! If you're comfortable with the price point, I'd definitely say these are worth it to me especially since I'm always willing to pay more for vegan and cruelty free products!"

Recently I have been seeking out hair care that is vegan and cruelty free like these. It is also gluten free and smells so great! The packaging is nice too, they look like little fruity drink bottles. The shampoo builds up a rich foamy lather and the aroma is perfect. My hair feels clean amd lightweight. The conditioner is great too. It feels thick but after rinsing my hair is more lightweight and adds volume. My hair just feels healthier and balanced out. I would seek out this brand in place of my previous most used shampoo and conditioner. Gifted by Briogeo."

The shampoo was too watered-down for me and did not produce a great latter as well the conditioner did not “condition” my hair.  When my wash was done, my hair felt and looked dry, tangled, and straw-like. Although I appreciate being able to try this product, I cannot see me purchasing it in the future nor recommending.

I swear it’s like I dunked my hair in two different smoothies, but I absolutely loved it. I find the sweet and tropical scent quite strong in the shampoo, and is a bit more muted in the conditioner- but I still enjoyed the scent since I’m into sweet scents! I really liked how the shampoo and conditioner were mostly naturally derived and that there were no harsh ingredients that seemed to damage my hair. I also appreciate that Briogeo creates products that are vegan, cruelty-free, and gluten-free. I struggle a lot with oil production in my scalp, which usually leads to an itchy scalp, but after using this shampoo and conditioner with papaya enzymes I can tell that coming out of the shower that my roots were no longer oily, yet my scalp did not seem dry nor dull. I truly did find that my hair was nourished and replenished after use, since my hair never felt as bouncy and shiny as it did after I air-dried it after my shower using these products. The products definitely helped a lot with the strength, health, and appearance of my hair; however, I find it cute yet a bit dangerous that the packaging of these products really did look like a smoothie or juice that I wanted to drink. I believe it was a really cute idea with the product, but it makes me curious as to if those who don’t know that these are shampoos or conditioners (or have young children at home) may find these and think they’re to drink. I wished the packaging had the words “shampoo” and “conditioner” in larger font to make this more obvious (I’m not even a young child, nor have children, and I know this is shampoo and conditioner- yet I want to drink it lol). I also found it a bit shocking that the shampoo was that loose, and not as viscous, as I expected it to (so it even has a consistency similar to juice, which is also a concern). But, I do recommend these shampoo & conditioner!"

Briogeo is a cruelty free, clean hair product that will work on all hair types so I was super excited to try this brand to see how it would work for my dry, way hair.  That set packaging was super cute and came with a bunch of information about the brand so I could get to know them better.  The packaging on these products is super cute and remind me of fresh made juices that one would get to drink from a grocery store.     Upon opening the shampoo, it smells  super good and fruity.  It definitely have a strong mango scent, but I don't get too much cherry from it, to be honest. I'm not complaining though because it smells mouth watering, almost good enough to eat!  The shampoo has a really runny texture so it's easy to accidentally spill it out of your hands.  I applied to the roots of my hair and it lathered up really nicely.  It rinsed away really easily and it left my hair feeling clean, but not stripped and dry, which I am very thankful for!! This is a gentle, but powerful shampoo that worked even for my dry hair. I'm impressed.  The conditioner has a thick, smooth texture to it.  It smells just as good as the shampoo, just like a mango smoothie! Yummy!  I applied the conditioner starting at my ends and working my way up, while detangling as I went.  It has a nice slip to it which made detangling very easy.  I left the conditioner the rest of my shower, rinsing right before it was time to get out, probably about 5 -7 minutes or so.  My hair felt SO soft when rinsing.  I am not exaggerating when I say, it's the smoothest and softest my hair has ever felt when rinsing a conditioner.  SO IMPRESSED!!  After drying, my hair actually looked really good.  It gave my hair a great shine (normally it's DULL) and added volume and bounce, which I was not expecting. I still had some tangles at my ends, which is just something that I've come to live with because of my hair texture, BUT I did notice an improvement a"

The shampoo lathers nicely, but not too sudsy since it is less lab made and more nature made.  The conditioner is thick and rinses cleanly while coating hair and making it silky.  It really feels as if I fed my hair superfoods."

The shampoo was a little more liquid then normal but it lathered really good. It left my hair feeling soft and clean. I have used similar products from other brands that strip my hair and dry it out.  This set does not do that. I am really impressed and happy with both the shampoo and conditioner."
