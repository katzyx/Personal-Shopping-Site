With my thin, sensitive hair, I'm always cautious about what I use, but this one has been great. It doesn‚Äôt cause any irritation or damage, and the results are definitely noticeable. My hair feels clean, refreshed, and it doesn‚Äôt dry out. It‚Äôs a perfect reset for my hair, and I love how gentle yet effective it is. Highly recommend for anyone with sensitive hair that still needs a good cleanse!"
