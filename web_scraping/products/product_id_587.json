I’ve tried to bake this work 5 times without much success. This was sticky but not to the magnets on the lashes which fell off quickly even after trying muliple coats."

The lashes had no issues sticking! I was able to wear the lashes with magnetic liner for several hours with no issues. It was a little difficult washing off but wouldn't be any issue if you have magnetic lash remover. This version is probably my favorite out of all of the magnetic liners"

The liner itself is a black liquid eyeliner and is very easy to apply. You can make it very precise and thin if you want. If using with magnetic lashes, i made it thick enough to match the width of the magnets on the lashes. It holds up the lashes for a long time. The packaging is very nice too. Overall, a win for me."
