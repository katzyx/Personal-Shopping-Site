I feel like the packaging is a little gimmicky but that’s what Refy is all about and I love that, but for this product in particular I recommend just taking the cap off to use it, it’s nice to use the roller if you keep it in your skin care fridge over night I’ve definitely noticed it helps with de-puffing when I use it cold like an ice roller. Feels nice on the skin and is good for oily/combo skin. I feel like if you’re on the dryer side this might not work quite as well."

It has a slightly tacky finish making it perfect for your foundation to stick to.   As for makeup longevity, I think it does its job well and keeps my base looking fresh for 7-8 hours.   Keep in mind that this is a water-based primer, so it worked with some foundations, but not others (works with some silicone foundations too). It might be worth to get a sample to test with your current foundation. For example, I use the Armani Luminous Silk and it goes together perfectly despite the Armani having silicones in it. However, it did not work well with my Nars soft matte and caused a lot of pilling. I found that it worked perfectly with all of my water-based foundations like Rare Beauty and Kosas.  I love that it has niacinamide in it and I honestly really like the roller, even if it's a bit gimmicky. I will definitely repurchase :)"

It separates it terribly and I know that those other two products are not the problem because I’ve applied it w/o the refy primer and it has had zero problem / creasing or separating. So If those are your go to foundation + concealer stay away from this product. Not to mention it also kinda broke me out and my skin isn’t really sensitive. However, it does have a really cool applicator, sleek look, and feels good on the skin but I wouldn’t waste my gold coins on this again sadly."

One, if you have skin that is acne-prone, particularly bacterial acne, I do not recommend. The applicator is pushed directly into the face with little other option and can't be cleaned very properly. Additionally, I can't say for sure, but I do have sensitive skin, and did experience some irritation and breakouts in areas that I normally wouldn't after using this product. I tried a few times and experienced this after each time.   Two, I COULD NOT get this product to properly dry down / get tacky for the rest of my base to adhere properly or stay on my skin. Like, laughably so. Every time I lightly touched my face, my foundation or concealer would just wipe off on my finger tip, even with setting spray, trying to dry down with my mini fan without applying anything else for a period of time.. It most likely has something to do with the base being water vs silicone.. but if you are looking for ease in your routine overall I would skip this. Not worth the hassle.   I use the MILK Hydro Grip Primer with few complaints & will continue to stick with that. If that's a product you like, I don't think this is something you will find comparable."

However, the product itself doesn't really do anything for me. I don't really see a lot of glow and it feels moisturizing at first, but dries down fast and feels not as moisturizing. For the price, I would never repurchase this product. I expected a lot better from this product and was honestly disappointed. I feel like this could have been so good because I love the applicator but the product is meh."
