My last one broke at the metal hinge after a year and a half and considering i work from home and only curl my lashes and wear makeup maybe once or twice a week, that seems strange. The little welded piece broke off and despite multiple attempts to super glue it back, I had to buy another one.

I was hoping that this being specialized for large or round eyes was going to work for me. When it arrived, I very excitedly tried it out and it only opens a very small amount so it's very hard to get my eyelashes into the opening and it definitely does not accommodate lashes to the edges of each eye. I also felt like it did not curl them well and the finger grip openings were difficult to use. I'm going to be returning it and seeing if I can find something in store that better meets my needs."

I'm not talking about the pads either, the metal bar on the top loosened and eventually fell off, during which time I really struggled to get lift on my lashes using this.   Maybe its because I have stubby eyelashes and have to press really hard, but isn't that the literal purpose of an eyelash curler?

When I looked up the reason why, apparently it's because the 'rule of thumb' is to replace the whole curler every so often for maximum results. Having come across this info, I caved and bought a brand new one not long ago. The first one lasted a long time and I never had a problem with it cutting or ripping out any eyelashes (which I've experienced with other brands). I've been a fan of the eyelash curler since I was 12 and now I'm 28, and this one is definitely my all time favourite!"

I have tried many different brands and styles of curlers, and I keep coming back to this solid, basic style. Tweezerman, Kevyn Aucoin, and Shu Uemura all have the direct spring action. So, if you squeeze, you get enough pressure.  I have tried some of the newer designs and didn’t like them at all. First, they’re bulkier and harder to see what you’re doing. Then the leverage spring means that you squeeze but not as much force is translated to crimping. Well, that means I had to squeeze SUPER hard and gave myself hand cramps.  So I keep coming back to this brand. It’s not perfect bc the silicone pads are hard and uncomfortable. But ALL the brands have hard, uncomfortable pads now."

There was no way of fixing this at home without a super narrow stick and some glue.   TL;DR Straight stubborn eyelashes curled alright. Right metal connector popped off with slight pressure.

I purchased it anyway because there was a VIP sale going on and honestly I couldn't turn down the pretty rose gold magic (that's the finish I chose) that was staring at me in the store. Turns out I was wrong and I totally do need this curler, it works great! It's a sturdy, very well made curler, which I feel are hard to come by. I've chopped off my lashes with crummy, cheap curlers before so I am so happy I made the upgrade. It also comes with several replacement cushions which is appreciated."

I've used previous eyelash curlers which have chopped my lashes off *sob* so I was extremely hesitant to try this one. Wanting to have beautifully curled lashes (no pain no gain, right?) I decided to give this one a go as I love the Tweezerman brand. This curler is sturdy and comes with several cushion refills, which is very appreciated. It helps that it also looks pretty in the rose good finish. Happy to have purchased this and I would definitely recommend it to someone who has had a bad experience with eyelash curlers in the past as well."
