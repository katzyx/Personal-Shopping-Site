Make sure to shake it so the glitter blends with the spray. I have dry skin, so I'm not sure how much you'd enjoy this if you have oily skin or just like a more matte look, but this makes me look like I drink a gallon of water every hour. The glitter can also be a bit messy, so be mindful of what you're wearing when you spray it - all my work shirts are super glittery now. Would make a stunning body glow as well I think. I only regret I didn't purchase the full size."

The kind of spray that 70% alcohol from the drug store has. However, it just applies the spray way too patchy, or makes you want to use a 2nd or 3rd pump which will make you look like Edward Cullen in the sunlight.  The spray also has a very floral scent. Like roses mixed with something else. Unlike other scented makeup it doesn't evaporate with time. So you just smell this smell on your face all day. If you wear perfume, depending on what perfume you wear, this scent will clash heavily if it isn't already floral.  Buy something else, or use a sheer highlighter all over your face, you will get the same effect."

After using it for about a week and a half, I can officially say that it is okay. I mostly used it in the morning before going to work or on the weekends before going out. I would use my cleanser, toner, tinted moisturizer, cover any odd marks, and reduce the effect of the dark circles under my eyes. Just light touches, but nothing too heavy. Then I would finish with the Iconic setting spray. It has a nice, light smell to it. I am not a fan of anything overpowering, so I am glad that it is not too heavy. Some other products are so strong that it affects my allergies, but this one doesn’t. When using this product, it does make my face stay fresher, longer throughout the day. I didn’t notice that my face was that much more moisturized, but the work covering my dark circles usually looks a little ragged at the end of the day, but now it looks a little better. Overall, I wouldn’t say that this product is life changing, but I am starting to see the benefit and I will definitely continue using the product with heavier looks to see if I notice an even bigger benefit."

My favorite is to use it as a prepping spray as it provides lasting hydration with the skins and makes my foundation sit well on my skin. I also use it as a setting spray and it gives the prettiest glow to the face. Lastly, you can also use this on any part of the body where you want some extra glow and once it sets it stays there for the rest of the day. This is a must for the summer!!"

It didn’t leave a shimmer for better or wish ( I know shimmer is divisive but given the stunning look of the bottle was hoping for such ) It does delivery a generic setting effect but didn’t notice any increased longevity of my makeup which is shame given its fragrance that I didn’t enjoy. I’d say the scent is generic cosmetic fragrance. Luckily I didn’t pay for this product and don’t feel like it worth the price for the sort of middle of the road effect."
