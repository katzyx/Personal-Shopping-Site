This bronzer bless so easily, doesn't break me out, is dewy, and not too overly pigmented. I can definitely see the bronzer on my face when I wear it while it still being natural. I personally don't mind the balmy texture but I think a lot of people are expecting this to be very pigmented when it literally says sheer in the name. The bronzer is definitely buildable as well."

I stalked the product information page for months before I took the leap to purchase. I wanted a contour/bronzer that was beginner friendly and the undertone of the product is neutral enough that I use as a contour. I felt that as a bronzer there needed  to be another color before this one so I'm happy I chose the darkest shade and it works for me. The packaging is so expensive looking, I just love using it everyday. For reference, I am a medium deep complexion, warm-neutral (possibly olive)."

I use the MERIT blending brush to blend this in on the forehead, down the nose, horizontally across my high cheeks and then along the jaw line, kind of contouring a bit. I love it for travel bc it‚Äôs smaller and easier to pack than a bronzer compact. I would give it 5 stars but I wish it would last longer and not wear off as fast in the summer."

Most bronzer or contour I've tried is either too grey, red, or orange leaning for my liking... I bought Merit in Clay from my local Sephora after they didn't have the fairest shade Quince in stock, but Clay ended up having the perfect undertone & pigmentation level for me.  It looks very natural, not too light, not too dark, easy to apply swiped directly onto my face, easy to pat/blend in with a brush without disappearing into nothing, never patchy, doesn't disturb my foundation, and does not irritate my skin at all. It is hard to find both the perfect color and formula, but I can honestly say I'm no longer looking for a cream bronzer. I've been using it for a couple months. It's my favorite."

I've been wearing Seine more in the summer, but in the dead of winter, I suspect I'll go back to Clay. One note: these are definitely warm toned bronzers, not cool contours.

If you're looking for clean, minimalist make-up that is high quality, this is it. I have the shade Seine, and it's the perfect not-too-dark shade on my Olive skin. I also love the cute packaging of all the products. Added bonus: the whole collection is carry-on friendly for travel, since most of it is solid/cream based! I bought the Full Collection on their website (the gift with purchase make-up bag was just too cute to pass up) and I'm so glad I did! I love every single one of their products!"

I have light skin with warm/golden/olive undertones. I tried a swatch of the next shade down, Seine, but that appeared orange on the back of my hand.   My impression is that the reviews are true -- the bronzer is very buildable and does not have a 'muddy' effect. However, this shade on me was not pigmented and appeared very slightly grayish on my skin. The cream bronzers I have tried and owned are Charlotte Tilbury's, 'Winky Lux' from Ulta, and concealers for contouring. Anastasia Beverly Hills also has some highlight sticks that work well for me as a bronzer. I have swatched the Fenty ones as well. This one seems to compare in quality, but the shade did not work."

With every one i‚Äôve tried, they have all been splotchy, peeling and picked up my makeup completely or just didn‚Äôt blend. WHEN I TELL YOU THIS BRONZER IS A HOLY GRAIL. This is the best bronzer i‚Äôve ever used. I‚Äôve read a lot of bad reviews for this product and noticed that they are saying it‚Äôs too sheer or picked up their makeup. First it says in the description SHEER BALM. I don‚Äôt use it with foundation because i just know it would ruin the look, it would either peel or pick up the makeup. I use this with just, primer and concealer, my makeup hasn‚Äôt looked this good in a long time. I think i‚Äôve finally found my routine and the next thing i‚Äôm going to purchase is Merits blush!"

However, if you get your usual shade the sheerness can be a bit too sheer, and not really do much of anything.

I bought the color Seine, which was a shade darker that I thought I needed and was concerned it would be too intense. It doesn't even show up. What little color their is in this greasy formula certainly does not hold up -- and yes, I set it with powder. I was really, really excited to get this and it has proven the biggest makeup disappointment I've had in some time."

To begin, I really like the glowy effect it leaves on the skin. The bronzer does not have a strong fragrance scent, which I appreciate and the product is not only easy to blend, but does not leave creases. As for the cons, I wished there were more shades because the lightest shades (quince) does not fit well on me unfortunately. It would be nice if there were more shades! This is my first time using a bronze stick, so I'm not sure if that is the case for all, but the bronzer did not stay throughout the day. The whole packaging is sleek, but I wished the quality was better. I am not sure if I received a defective one, but I had difficulty opening the cap, and when I opened it, the whole bronzer stick fell out. I had to disinfect before using the bronzer. Again, I think I had a too high expectation, but I would recommend to try it out yourself and make your own opinion this. I ended up giving this to a friend whom is more tan, and she uses it more as a foundation and she loves how it is not heavy on the skin."

Applies and blends out so easily, but it doesn't move around or move your base makeup when you blend it. It's so natural looking, giving the skin that perfect bronzed glow.

It is smooth on my skin and it doesn‚Äôt feel drying. I am a person with sensitive skin and some products tend to break me out on first contact, but this had no bad affect on my skin. I do have yellow/ olive undertones to my skin. So Leo Bronze Balm doesn‚Äôt make me feel washed out. The perfect natural coverage. Another thing I like is that it doesn‚Äôt have a particular scent, I am a bit sensitive when it comes to face products and fragrances in them. This Bronze Balm is great! AND IT IS VEGAN!"

It also makes a perfect contour since it‚Äôs a very neutral shade.   It is the perfect cream consistency: it sinks into the sink just enough so that you can easily rub it in but it doesn‚Äôt disappear either. Some bronzer sticks are too stiff and you end up pulling your skin to rub it in.  It‚Äôs very buildable, I use a few applications each time I apply it to get my perfect color.   There is no scent, and you get quite a bit of product. Merit hit a home run with this bronzer!"

This product is a game-changer. I've never been a huge fan of bronzers for a couple reasons. First of all, I like to use a lot of blush, and it's difficult to use both without minimizing the impact of each one individually. Second, I hate the overly fake, heavily bronzed look that a lot of traditional powder bronzers leave you with.  I tried the Bronze Balm in the shade Seine, which was perfect for my summer skintone: lightly tanned yet still fair. I loved how subtle yet buildable it was, and the cream consistency made it much easier to use than any powder bronzer I've tried. Furthermore, there was just the slightest hint of sparkle when I applied it on my cheekbones! Perfect for the dewy summer no makeup makeup look.  Definitely love this and highly recommend it to anyone who's looking to enhance their natural face tan a little but without the heavy, cakey 2000s look."

This is perfect for my no-makeup makeup days! Highly recommend giving this a try to add to your routine!"
