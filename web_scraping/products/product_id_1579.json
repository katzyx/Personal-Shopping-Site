			"review_text": "I have very sensitive skin and typically cannot use products with fragrances, but this oil did not cause any breakouts. I genuinely appreciate that. However, the tan it provides is not long-lasting. I mix 3-4 drops with my moisturizer in the morning, and while the initial tan looks great, it completely disappears after washing my face at night. Given the cost of the product, I would expect the tan to last at least a few days before fading."

I’ve used it for my face as well as whole body and love it. Not a big smell, can use it with my regular lotion. And I love that it’s customizable for how dark. I’m very pale so I only need a couple drops to see results. No problems with streaming. Looks so natural."

This product blew my mind and my expectations, it’s more expensive than I’d prefer, but it works! It gives such a nice tan glow, helps balance out my foundation with my self tanned body, and I find it mixes in really well with my Sunday Riley CEO Vitamin C serum. I apply them every night before bed and wake up with a healthy & natural looking tan glowing face."

I’m fair and mix 5 drops with my night cream and I usually wake up with a gorgeous glow.  My only issue is that after a day or two I end up with a tan line in my hairline. It’s a pain, I have to scrub it off, not sure why that happens, but it’s a medium price to pay for a tan"

			"review_text": "As someone who has olivey skin and tans easily, i was excited to be able to extend my tan outside of the summer season. Unfortunately i found that quantifying exactly how much product i needed was difficult. I either could barely tell i had any on, or there was a clear difference between my forehead and hairline. I think this might work better on people with fairer skin. I have friends that swear by it but im just not sure it works well for me."
