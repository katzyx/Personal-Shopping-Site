This particular one is my least favourite of the three because the scent smells more like a mens cologne than French Cade and Lavender - which is why I knocked off a star. You don't get much lavender or verbena but you do get a lot of cade wood in the scent. It has a decent throw but it takes a while burning for it to reach its full potential - so I would recommend it for smaller spaces. It reminds me a lot of Chanel Allure Homme, but a bit less sweet. It burns slower than Mokara but faster than my Vanilla Latte. Overall it's a good candle, very pretty, and honestly a nice scent, but the Cade Wood completely overpowers the other notes so it didn't live up to its claims."

(I've attached a photo, if you look closely on the left side of the candle the wax has dissapeared completely, but on the right side of the jar there is wax not fully melted.)Asides from this the scent is subtle which I like. I find the longer you burn it, the stronger the scent becomes gradually. Filled my small living room and kitchen with no issues; scent wise I was dissapointed by the lack of lavendar. The scent leans more towards the masculine side as it is more woody. Looks beautiful when lit, can't wait to repurpose the jar. Not bad for the price but would reconsider a different scent for next time."

I personally decided to use it only in the bedroom and even my husband said it said “really good” which is a lot of words coming from him. It changes the atmosphere of the place with that awesome and relaxing scent.  Thank you for this gorgeous product."

As for the fragrance, it smells almost like a soap bar and is a clean scent. The throw, however, is extremely lacking. For a good 10 minutes the only smell I got out of the candle was the smell of the wick burning. Even after the burnt wick scent was less prominent, the fragrance was quite light. I couldn’t really smell it at all and had to lean my nose literally right into the candle to smell anything. Overall, the packaging is lovely, but the pervasiveness of the fragrance is lacking. I’m not too sure if I’d purchase this for its fragrance only."

			"review_text": "Y'all, THIS SMELL!! It's clean and a little floral and a lot intoxicating. I don't understand the other reviews saying this candle has a light scent because that is not my experience. I have purchased plenty of those $10 Target soy wax candles, but I always come back to Voluspa. It is worth the price for three reasons: it fills your entire house with scent when lit; it burns evenly for 100 hours; and once it's done the jar makes an amazing vase/storage/whatever piece to keep. The cold throw on this candle is amazing as well - I just leave it open sometimes to enjoy the smell in the room. I even have an open (the no-lid, smaller version) in my bathroom to keep it smelling pleasant in there. I always get a hit of it when washing my hands or standing in front of my mirror. When burning, it does so evenly. When I have had tunneling with this candle it some how self-corrects after a few burns. I've gone through about 8 of these and never had one not finish evenly. This scent and brand is hands down my favorite candle that I will repurchase until I die. I'm serious."

The lively lavender notes are balanced with the French Cade Wood and Verbena creating a harmonious fragrance that has an excellent throw. This is the candle I like to light in the morning while I get my day started, it always leaves me feeling ambitious with a calm sense of peace."
