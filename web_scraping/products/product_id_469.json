I try everything to tame my fly aways, and this product is the only thing that does.I usually use it a couple of times a month, but honestly, I feel like I should use it more often. My hair is always so shiny and manageable after using this. I have a lot of hair, and it is thin, but this also gives me volume. I do not always post comments, but this product and the Dae leave in the conditioner have changed my hair. I also chopped my hair off to my ears a year ago and it has grown so quick down to my mid back and I think those two products and my diet have something to do with it. I lost 65 pounds and instead of losing hair i got more on my head and I really think these products helped that."

Luckily, I was able to save some of it, while a bunch of it got on my skin as I was cleaning it up off my floor.  I noticed about a half hour later, my hands and arms were really itchy.  Literally the only thing different was this oil.  So, there must be something in it that my body doesn't agree with.  Guess it was meant to be my not using it and causing my scalp even more problems.  Hopefully it works well for others;  me, however, it seems to make my skin itch more."

This serum is nice but I haven’t noticed a huge difference. It’s nice on the scalp & doesn’t leave me greasy or oily, but that’s about it. More so of a hydrating product for me than a soothing one. I don’t feel amazing about it but I also don’t mind it because my scalp needs the moisture. I don’t itch too much, my hair doesn’t look greasy & I also don’t feel dry. It’s OK for me (gifted in exchange for honest review)"

Plus, as the weather gets colder, I deal with dry and itchy scalp, so proper care isn’t just a want—it’s a need.  I use this product alongside their scalp scrub once a week. If I’m showering in the morning, I leave it on overnight; otherwise, I let it sit for 5-10 minutes before showering.  I love its lightweight, oil-serum texture. It’s non-greasy and feels instantly soothing. Plus, it's packed with moisturizing and calming ingredients that give my scalp the relief it craves."

What’s most remarkable is how quickly it works—within an hour, the itchiness calms down, and my sensitive scalp feels noticeably soothed.

The serum has a distinctive amla scent, which I was already familiar with. While I’m not a fan of the smell, I’m willing to tolerate it for good results.  Applying the serum felt like a self-care ritual. I used a full dropper, warmed it in my hands, and massaged it into my scalp for a few minutes. The process was soothing and relaxing—almost meditative. I left the serum on overnight and washed my hair in the morning.  I believe that scalp care is an essential part of having well-maintained, healthy hair, and this serum fits perfectly into that philosophy. This was my first time using a product like this, and I’m genuinely impressed. I look forward to incorporating it into my self-care routine a couple of times a week.  In the photo, you can see how my hair looks after washing—it feels more manageable, and I’m excited to continue using this product to see long-term results!"

The calming effect is noticeable almost immediately after application, and over time, my scalp feels much healthier."

			"review_text": "For me, the scent was the only good thing about this product. The TL:DR version is that the first time I used this as directed, I had SIGNIFICANT fall out that has continued for 2+ weeks (I haven't used it again). I'll be returning all three F&M hair oils that I purchased out of an abundance of caution.  The details: In the past, I used the Briogeo Scalp Revival Charcoal + Tea Tree Scalp Treatment Serum and loved it. I didn't use it as part of a regular routine, but I would put it on any time my scalp felt itchy or dry. Sometimes that was just one or two spots, sometimes it was my whole scalp, but it always worked wonderfully to soothe the itch immediately. When that bottle finally ran out, I decided to try the Fable & Mane serum just to try something new.  The F&M serum definitely did NOT provide the amount of itch relief that the Briogeo serum did... honestly, I didn't feel like it provided much itch relief at all. I used it as a tiny spot treatment one night and it didn't do anything other than make my hair kinda oily in that spot.  A few nights later, again with an itchy scalp, I decided to try it the way you're supposed to, by putting it all over my scalp. I used one dropper full, and maybe a few extra drops. I left it on overnight, and the next morning when I washed my hair, it came out in ***huge fistfuls***.   Needless to say, I haven't used the serum again, but the shedding hasn't stopped, and it isn't limited to the shower - I'm constantly picking hair off my clothes, desk, food, and I fill my hairbrush every time I brush. The pic is just what came out in the shower on my hands a week later.   I'm now desperately hunting something to curb the shedding, but I'm also traumatized and afraid that anything I try might make it worse. I have long, fine hair but a lot of it - there doesn't seem to be a visible difference in my hair yet, but I've filled a small bathroom trash can with hair over the last two weeks.   My ten cents? Just use the Briogeo one!"

I don't get what it's supposed to smell like, but to me it almost smells like pencil shavings which is not a bad smell it's just not a scent that I prefer. For me the $36 just I think because I didn't feel like there was many results or I noticed any difference in using it or enjoyed using it, I feel like is a bit too expensive. I don't know truly what this means by release stress, but I didn't notice really anything using this. And like I said it's just so liquidy and runny if you get too much it will definitely drip everywhere so I'm not sure I just think maybe this product wasn't for me I'm not saying it's bad, it just did not work out for me. Definitely give it a try to see if it works out for you, because I don't think it's so expensive that it would be a risk to try it."

It softens and smoothes hair cuticles, making hair less prone to breakage, and penetrates into follicles for soft, shiny hair. It's supposed to be safe for color treated hair,  silicone free and vegan. The main ingredient claims are a Amla and Bakuchi. The added fragrance is fresh blackcurrant, a heart of tea rose and orange blossom on a bed of woody amber and skin musk. I thought it smelled kinda of like pleasant herbal incense. Not bad but not extremely nice either.  The intended use is every other week on the scalp as a prewash for 5 minutes to overnight. However on a website, it suggests it as a leave in oil. The video says to put it on the hair lengths  but the website says not. It comes in a glass dropper bottle. The ad suggests that it is light purple in color but mine was clear. This product has the most discrepancies in its instructions I've ever seen. I used it as a pre-wash and thought it was fine. The oil does feel lightweight and seems to rub in well. I think it does an ok job with moisturizing my dry scalp. I don't think it will fix my problems, but I like the idea. Otherwise I think it performed the same as many other hair oils."

The smell isn’t the greatest but once it’s on my hair I couldn’t smell it at all.

The smell is not great is very earthy not my favorite. I do overall like this because of the quality ingredients. I don't think that I will use this every day due to it being smelling so bad. And it leaves my hair stinking all day.  Even after I wear it at night time so I will probably continue using stuff. I was using prior but in the winter time I get dry scalp.

I have severe dandruff issues with dry ends, as the water in Boston is quite hard on my hair. Trust me when I say that it works wonders. Planning to club it with Fable and Main Hair oil mist. (haven't bought it yet)   Pros: 1. Its not thick in texture and not at all oily. It is serum oil, so I thought it might be somewhat oily. 2. You can leave it for an hour before hair washing, and it works equally well. However, I would suggest going overnight once a week.  3. Since I am Indian and know the wonders of AMLA in hair, it works on my dry hair and has been helping me reduce my scalp issues.  4. This gives an amazing shine to my hair. Sometimes I take 2-3 drops and just apply them to hair ends as an everyday routine. This helped me keep my hair looking healthy and shiny when I am traveling or going out for dinner.   Cons: I have not found any issues yet. In case something comes up, I will update the same."

You can definitely feel the difference immediately; it is a great alternative to clarifying shampoo without drying the scalp. The serum is soothing and makes the hair shiny, but I do recommend using it at night because it can feel heavy."

Additionally, the pleasant herbal scent adds to the overall calming experience during application. What sets this serum apart is its ability to promote healthier hair growth.

I decided to leave the product on my scalp for about 2&1/2hrs while having the HoliRoots Pre-Wash Oil on my hair itself. This combination and leaving the two on for a couple hours really help with my dry itchy scalp and seemed to soften my hair itself. I must state that I am not really a fan of the SahaScalp scent as it's strong enough to remind you that there is a serum on your scalp, however, after washing my hair with my shampoo (NOT Fable&Mane) the scent was completely gone, no lingering. While I don't necessarily have thick hair, I do have lots of it, and found that I needed at least 1&1/2 dropper full and could have use two full droppers in order to really massage my entire scalp. The 1 dropper wasn't enough to even focus off the parts of my scalp more sensitive and in need of TLC in the -10c weather. So I can see myself using up this product quickly enough as it states that you should use it bi-weekly, which is a downside. Otherwise so far it is looking like a good product for dry itchy winter scalp!"

I have been using this serum on my itchy scalp once a week over the last 4 weeks or so (even though it says to use biweekly). First, the weight & scent- I really do enjoy the scent even though it seems many people do not like it. I would say if you’re sensitive to scents, this is not for you. The weightlessness and texture of the product was very nice as well- it is a very thin liquid without feeling overly oily. I left it on my scalp twice overnight and twice for about a half hour before washing my hair. I’m not sure that it really made a difference in my results. Now, for my results- not too dramatic if any difference. I’ve been suffering with a very itchy scalp for quite a few months & I was looking forward to testing this serum to hopefully rehydrate my scalp. It didn’t make my scalp any worse, but I also don’t think it really helped at all. I’m going to continue using this serum since I would like to definitively figure out if I see any benefits from using it. Overall, it is a nice serum with a relaxing scent, but I’m not sure if it will show you results. I will update if anything changes while I continue to use the serum."

I will say that while it did not do anything it claimed, it also did not leave my hair greasy or weighed down. The instructions are vague at best saying to apply biweekly but does not specify if they mean twice per week or twice per month. I tried this prior to showering and leaving it overnight per the instructions but that didn’t make a difference. Upon first opening the bottle it doesn’t seem to have much of a scent but if you leave it on overnight the smell becomes disgustingly horrid like vinegar. The consistency is very runny and watery.

I tried to use it on my scalp over night (several times) and also before the washing of my hair (2-3 hours prior).  I’m not sure if it’s a coincidence but when I used it over night I could not sleep well and was waking up all the time. The scent was a little bit overwhelming for me because it was not only on my hair after all but also on my pillow. I would not recommend to use it overnight. Instead - in the day.  I see the difference in my scalp condition. My scalp is dry in several spots. It went away after using the product.  Also I want to mention about quality of my hair: I saw bad reviews about making hair oily. I’m not sure how it could happen. I used this product very heavily on my roots and hair and in my opinion my hair felt cleaner after this product and less oily for several days.

First off all using the sahascalp alma soothing serum was a relaxing experience in itself. It has a strong earthy spa type scent I which I enjoyed but it may not be everyone. The ingredients are clean, vegan and cruelty free and it's suitable for all hair types. It's easy to use, when you know you are going to wash your hair just apply the oils to your scalp and I massaged it in. Felt good and relaxing and the scalp massage itself helps hair grow I did notice some more growth. After I washed my hair as usually and blowed dried my hair I felt my scalp cleaner and my hair was lighter. My roots felt great and my hair was soft. My hairs texture is fine and I’ve been having some issues with thinning and fall out, my ends are dry and my scalp has some product build up which was gone after using this. I actually enjoyed this as a part of my self care routine and will kept using this product."

I’ve tried every product, from the high end to low, and very rarely do I find something that actually works for my head. The last couple of months I have been switching up some of the hair care products I use hoping to find a different shampoo/conditioner combo since my previous had been discontinued… needless to say, I actually created more severe dandruff for myself and my scalp was so itchy I felt like I needed to be washing it every day or I would go crazy clawing at my head (I traditionally don’t wash my hair every day unless doing some activity where I get my hair dirty). Anyway, I was very excited to receive the SahaScalp Amla Soothing Serum because it was supposed to help relieve the exact thing I was suffering from, dry/itchy scalp. I can personally say that applying the serum definition helped. Within a couple of minutes I noticed that the itchiness I was feeling was significantly reducing and my scalp was more soothed. Not very familiar with the ingredients, but the serum is made with a super berry called Amla which is a form of vitamin c and Bakuchi which is supposed to help with sensitive scalps. The silicon formula is very lightweight and a full dropper, rubbed between my palms and massaged all over my head was enough to soothe the itchiness. The bottle is also very pretty, and the dropper easy to use. Overall, the product won’t cure the dandruff I have or completely erase the itchiness, but it’s good for temporary relief. The reason for the star deduction is that I’m not crazy for the smell. It’s definitely unisex, but I can’t quite pinpoint the exact smell, just that it’s very earthy. I was hoping it would smell more like lavender. The other reason I deducted stars  is because the serum definitely makes your hair oily. So really the only option I have is to"

For the past year, my scalp got extremely dry, possibly due to stress and a change in lifestyle/diet. I tried many different solutions to hydrate and heal my scalp. Prescriptions from my dermatologist helped, but I wanted to find ways to nourish my scalp further. I had tried oil treatments, but the oils always felt heavy and weighed my thick hair down. Conditioning treatments were great for hydrating my hair, but they weren't effective as a skincare for my scalp.   When I received the SahaScalp Amla Smoothing Serum from Fable & Mane, I was excited to try it. I love the herbal scent of this product. It is not strong, but it does not smell artificial like many hair serums on the market. The texture is the best. It's an oil, but it's so light, and as you massage it into the scalp, your fingers don't feel oily like coconut oil. I know you're supposed to take the oil into your palms and then rub it into your scalp, but I have thick, medium-long Asian hair, and getting any serums or oils onto my scalp from my hands is challenging. The oils always end up on my hair. So I used the dropper to apply the serum onto specific areas on my scalp, and I loved this method! I can massage my scalp easily without getting the oil all over my hair. I wipe the dropper with alcohol wipes before putting it back into the bottle.   I leave this beautiful treatment overnight and shampoo the next day, and I can feel the difference it has made. The dry spots on my scalp are more hydrated and not itchy. This is a product I will buy for myself when I run out."

I have dry curly (3c) hair and an oily scalp that is prone to psoriasis patches. I usually go two or three days between washing my hair.  Since I usually shower at night before bed, the first option just wasn’t going to work if I wanted to use this regularly. So at first I tried massaging a few drops into my scalp before a shower. A few drops was NOT enough! I had to use about three droppers full in order to get enough slip so that I could work the product into my skin. For as small as the bottle is, I don’t think that is very cost-efficient. I washed my hair as normal right after and honestly did not notice anything different about my scalp. It did leave my hands feeling very soft, though!  I decided to change my shower routine so that I could try this serum by letting it sit overnight. I massaged another three droppers full (yikes!) into my scalp at night, plopped my dry hair into a top knot, and went to bed. When I woke up, the light fragrance was still there and I could tell the serum had worked into my roots, as they were  very oily. No matter, I was about to wash it out anyway. I shampooed and conditioned as usual and then used my regular curl gel and diffuse-dried my hair. Even after all the extra products I could still smell it faintly and I did notice that my scalp felt a little oilier than normal. Even though I had massaged shampoo into my scalp, my roots still felt a little weighed down - probably because of the amount of serum I had to use to get it worked in.  Since I could not work it into my routine, I gave it to my husband, who shaves his head. He likes it a lot.  Overall I enjoyed the herbal smell, which I think smells like very faint crushed black pepper. My husband says it smells like like a pink eraser from elementary school."

It was a bit oily but very light and I did feel a nice refreshing tingle in my scalp but the overpowering smell ruined it for me sadly so I won’t be trying it again."

			"review_text": "I was excited to see that I was receiving Fable and Mane Amla Soothing Serum voxbox. I really loved what this did for my hair! On my first use I put one dropper on my scalp and worked the excess on the ends. My hair is very, very long but one dropper was almost too much for my baby fine hair type. Amla is Indian gooseberry which is a Vitamin C conditioner. I have read reviews that are both positive and negative regarding the scent of this serum. Unfortunately mine falls into the negative. The very woody, strong smell is overwhelming and gives me a bit of a headache. It does not dissipate the longer you wear it so it was difficult for me to keep it on overnight. I do love the results but almost can’t tolerate the smell. I am planning on using this bi-weekly, only 1/2 of a dropperful and only leaving it on for a few hours versus overnight.  The other thing that is very confusing to me are the different directions. On the bottle itself it says when applying to “focus on the scalp”. On their website it says, “We recommend that this serum be used on the scalp only” when someone asked if you could use it on the ends. There is a video on YouTube from Fable & Mane that shows how to apply the serum. In the video it shows them putting 1 initial dropperful in the model’s hair. Then she uses 3 more dropperful’s in her hair and says, “You can never use too much, this is literal magic”. She even says “Don’t forget to cover your scalp all the way to the ends”. I did notice that it said this was for “deeper conditioning” but the different instructions are confusing to me. Do you just put it on your scalp only? Do you use it throughout your hair? One dropperful or 4 dropperful’s?  I’m just going to do what works best for my particular hair type. I do recommend this if you have an itchy scalp and dry hair. If you are sensitive to very strong woody smells, you probably won’t like the scent much."

I’m 43 and I have thin naturally oily hair , but my hair was breaking off so bad ( plus hair loss ), my scalp was starting to get product buildup and it was really itchy before using this serum. After my second use I noticed that my hair was even more soft , I had no product buildup, less breakage, and it’s not itchy anymore! Way less hair in the drain catcher as well.  The only cons for me was the scent was a little overwhelming for me and it had tingling sensation that lasted for about 20-30 mins. I have really sensitive skin and this didn’t irritate my scalp. I used a scalp massager to help get any buildup I had along with the serum and I had great results. It definitely outweighed the cons I had.

When I used it the first time, I was very impressed. I used about half a dropper (I have a lot of thick hair) and massaged it in throughout. I’ve read some people think the scent is overwhelming, which I then became afraid of, but I found it to be pleasant and relaxing. I did a double shampoo wash to make sure it wouldn’t leave my hair greasy. It made my hair so smooth and gave it a healthy shine from root to ends. My favorite thing was how good my scalp felt; hydrated and well nourished. The only and biggest problem I’ve come across is how my scalp feels when I don’t use it. I wash my hair every 2-3 days and I use every other wash, so 1-2 times a week. I’ve found on the washes I don’t use this, my scalp feel more irritated/itchy than before I started using it. It’s also summer and my scalp has been burned by the sun a few times so that has also played an additional role in this. Overall, if you’re looking for a scalp serum I would recommend this."

So thanks y’all for making a gal feel special & making me blush.    Anyhoo, this serum had a pleasant smell-  undertones of lavender musk. In my opinion it’s very much unisex scented. The serum is purple tinted, but it is slick and oily once settles in my roots. I generously applied this on my dry scalp. Like I mentioned It did leave my roots oily, but I probably applied way too much. So apply it as you deem fit for you..  While I left this on for several hours. I did feel a slight sensation on my scalp a few times, idk if it’s the product or maybe my AC was blowing just right & making it tingle randomly lol. I eventually took a thorough shower and washed my hair twice the first shower after use, but even after my shower it left with greasiness.  So with that said I know this product says for all hair types and helps with moisture and itchy scalp. I think this might be a better product for folks that need this. l’m not sure how I was selected for this exactly as I have the opposite problem. I have overproduction of oil on my scalp. So this is a product I won’t use twice a month as suggested, more like once every few months.  Packaging is cute, glass bottle and vial.  Did not arrive sealed though."

It felt very “expensive” and I was excited to try it. It doesn’t feel cheap and makes me want to display it on my vanity.   I first tried it right away, my hair hadn’t been washed in three days and was completely dry. It was a little oily at the time. When I first opened it, I immediately noticed the scent. It is very earthy and to me, very strong. I don’t mind the scent, but it does feel overwhelming to me. Right now I have my hair very short (for reference a four guard on hair trimmers), so I didn’t need much product, yet it still felt overwhelming.   It did feel really good after in my dry hair. I left it overnight and in the morning, it did feel very nice! My hair didn’t feel oily. I went to go get a shower. The real test would be after my shower and to see how it felt in a day or two. I suffer from dandruff and purposely used a shampoo that I use every once in a while that doesn’t control the dandruff. I let my hair dry, put it on my scalp and massaged it in. I didn’t put anything else in my hair. Usually my dandruff is noticing in as little as a day after washing, but 24 hours in and no dandruff! 48 hours in, I noticed a small amount. At 3 days  in, it was getting worse but not as noticeable as my hair usually gets! So, overall, I do really enjoy this product and WILL continue to use it…. But I have this four stars because the scent really puts me off."

I used a full dropper Of this formula, rubbed it between the palms of my hands then massaged it into the crown of my scalp. I do enjoy the scent it’s light not that strong. Love that it has Alma In it which is a fantastic vitamin C and other great ingredients that improve scalp health. It doesn’t leave my hair oily like their other pre-wash oil “Holiroots”. I did use this product overnight. My hair was incredibly soft and shiny the next day when I rinsed it out. I will continue to use this till it’s done. Then I will let you know if I re-purchase. I did receive this product complimentary from influencer and is part of a campaign “incentivized”."

			"review_text": "**I received this product for free from @influenster and @fableandmane in exchange for my honest review**  Fable & Mane SahaScalp Amla Soothing Serum is a weightless elixir infused with ancient Indian super berry Amla that works to nourish hair while soothing the scalp and clearing product build-up.   Key Ingredients: - Super Berry Amla is rich in vitamin C and antioxidants, deeply conditions and soothes the scalp  - Aloe enriched in Vitamin E, works to calm, strengthen, and nourish dry scalps - Bakuchi encourages the regeneration of skin cells while hydrating and nourishing the scalp  Texture/Scent: - The serum is naturally colored and has a sandalwood/floral scent   The serum is lightweight oil that spreads easily across the scalp to massage in and quickly absorbs. It washes out easily without having to do any additional washes and doesn’t leave behind any oily residue once rinsed. I like how well it helped relieve and soothe itchiness from dry skin on my scalp that I tend to get after having my hair colored. It leaves my hair feeling more soft and smooth and after a couple uses my hair looks and feels healthier and stronger. My only real con is I’m not a fan of the scent. It’s earthy, like bits of sandalwood and floral, and it’s a bit overpowering.  I found that this worked best when I used 3-4 dropper fulls the night before I washed my hair.  And while it’s meant to be used only on the scalp, I enjoyed working it down to the ends of my hair. While I enjoy the Holi Oil more I do think this is a good hair serum for those with dry and sensitive scalps that need to improve their overall hair condition.   PROS: ✅ Doesn’t weigh hair down  ✅ Easily washes out of hair w/o extra washes ✅ Doesn’t leave behind a greasy residue  ✅ Relieves itchiness from dry skin on the scalp immediately  ✅ Leaves hair feeling soft and more smooth  ✅ Has helped strengthen my hair  ✅ Hair has more shine to it   CONS: ❌ Not a big fan of the scent as it’s a bit overpoweri"

It's dry and itchy despite trying different treatments.  This Fable & Mane SahaScalp Amal Soothing Serum was easy to use and soothed my scalp.  Its scent immediately transported me to a luxurious spa.  The scent is isn't overpowering but holds its presence and is light, not overly greasy like some can be.  I use the treatment right before bed so that I can keep it in overnight to gain the full benefits.  I suggest using the product sparingly to avoid making your scalp greasy and weighed down; especially if you're doing the treatment overnight.  Immediately after applying the serum my scalp started to feel soothed and moisturized.  Everyone is different, but it's working well for me and I suggest giving it a try!"

Let me start by saying the oil is very thin and light weight and will spread well on your scalp. If your hair and the porosity levels work. For someone like myself with a super thick 4c hair you will need more product to be actually able to penetrate the cell. Now let’s get to the fragrance. I absolutely love the smell of this product but it is very much giving lavender rosemary and earth like scents. I will say the product did stop the itching. It wasn’t immediately but in a fair amount of time. I didn’t like that this oil has to be washed out. Most women of color do not wash their hair on a regular basis surely not daily. So unfortunately this product can’t be some thing I can add to my regular routine."

I’ve been experiencing some postpartum hair loss recently and I’ve been trying to style it differently to make it appear fuller. All the styling has led to drying out my scalp so I was really excited when I received this product. I used it a few times as directed and the first night I tried it, I was immediately turned off by the scent. It’s hard to describe but it reminds me of perfume for a 65+ age range. I tried it a few more times, figuring since I’m using it at night maybe the smell won’t bother me but it the scent got trapped in my pillow and started giving me headaches at night. I used it for about a week or so before I decided to give up on it. While using it, I did notice it helped with scalp dryness but because I am still experiencing some hair loss, the oil weighed my hair down and made it look thinner and greasy until I washed it out. Overall, the product does what it’s supposed to do as long as you don’t mind the way it smells."

I have switched to briogeo's scalp serum as it is does not leave anything on the hair and it does an equally good job.

My scalp is always dry and itchy, irritated even which can drive me bonkers.   This product really came to the rescue with its scalp soothing spa like treatment. It has a pleasant almost incense like scent and it’s a light one as long as you use it sparingly.   Use it sparingly because you want to be able to leave this in overnight to let it give you the full effect.   Too much and it will be greasy gross! It really will nourish your hair and leave your scalp feeling moisturized and your hair shiny smooth.   Give it a try, this worked well for me and is great for pampering yourself."

Unless you have crazy thick hair or a super dry scalp, you should always double shampoo this out.  BUT. Ever since I used this, my crown has been super itchy. It doesn’t make any sense for something labelled as ‘soothing’. I’m assuming I have a sensitivity to something in it.  I will also add that is smells nothing like the holi-roots oil, which was a relief to me. The holi-roots smells so good, but it’s overwhelming strong and gets sickly after a while. My hair also liked this way more than the holi-roots oil. I truly wish it didn’t make my scalp itchy otherwise it’d be a holy grail for me."

This product is still a great solution for breaking up sebum on the scalp and has some prime ingredients to help with cell turnover in topical applications. I'm just pretty sensitive to smells so I'll have to use this oil only overnight, to sleep in, and then immediately wash upon waking up. For that use, I'm more than happy with the efficacy of this product. But when it comes to versatility, I'll stay with the F&M Pre-Wash Oil which I can use on my scalp before or after cleansing, on my ends, mixed in with my leave-on/styling products - it's just way easier and better suited for my needs."

However, I could not figure out why, all of a sudden, I was losing so much hair every time I ran my fingers through my hair when I was doing everything right: vitamins, expensive product, conditioning treatments, masks, minimal washing, no heat...I attributed it to my thyroid. I applied this generously to my scalp and left it on overnight and the results were instant (side note: this product does have a stronger smell but I regularly use essential oils so I enjoyed this smell and found it relaxing). My scalp felt soft and clean...product build up had definitely been removed, no more hair when I pulled on it—even in the morning when I take my hair out of a braid. Quality product, 10/10, highly recommend. I cannot wait to see how it will continue to help my hair as I continue using it."

I use the recommended amount, sometimes I drop half of it into my hands and the other half directly on different points of my scalp. I naturally have flat hair that gets oily within a day of washing, so I only use this at home/overnight - however, it does not weigh hair down like hair oil. Sometimes I even massage the serum in laying with my head hanging off the side of my bed… I hear this is great for blood circulation. The only downside for me is that I’m not a fan of the scent, it’s just too herbal for me as I prefer sweet or fruity scents.  Overall, my roots feel happy, healthy and nourished. I even gifted this product to my sister who has experienced a bit of hair loss post-partum."

The scent is not my favorite, but I was willing to work with it if it meant it worked... I gave it a good effort but in the end, I returned the item. A couple of other things that make this product have a relatively low rating is that the serum is really thin, I was expecting more of a thicker consistency, so it made it slightly more difficult to apply throughout the sides of my head (application on the top of muy head was fine). This might be a small detail, and I'm not sure if my bottle was defective, but the dropper was awful... it was very difficult to get a solid mL of product onto the dropper with the aspirator... I know, it is a picky thing, but it added up over time and made me return the product."

I have a very dry scalp, and dry hair as well. it is very difficult to find products that truly help with my hair frizziness and dullness too (it’s cuz of the dryness). fable and manes products help me so much. this one smells very earthy, and have ingredients that help me with my scalp care. SUPER nice! Definitely try it out."

I think this serum works best for anyone who showers in the morning because it can help with sleep and can be left overnight. I keep the serum in about 1-2 hours before taking my evening shower, but I end up with such shiny locks! However, I can't vouch for the dryness or itchiness claims, just because I haven't had those problems in awhile!"

Plus the scent is very relaxing, it is the perfect scent to smell before heading to bed.  I have a dry and itchy scalp but this seum has been a huge help. If you are looking for a scalp serum do give this one a try!"

This serum works beautifully, it not only soothes my scalp, but also adds shine to my hair.  The formula is truly elegant, so this oil is lightweight. It’s one of the few products I keep in it’s original packaging. It has become a ritual for me to open the box, read the beautiful message inside of it, rub one full dropper of oil between my palms, inhale it’s gorgeous calming smell, and massage into scalp. I leave it overnight and wash my hair in the morning."

I felt a gentle soothing effect which is welcome in the summer heat! After rinsing, my hair and scalp felt hydrated and my hair was soft, shiny and so easy to style the next day. I’m utterly obsessed!"

I struggle with scalp issues and buildup and initially thought an oil serum wouldn’t help but it actually absorbed so well into my scalp and hair, felt less oily over time and help break up some of that build up. It had a calming smell and makes me want to massage my head, which is really nice. I’m a fan!"

I absolutely love the smell, I love the soothing feel when I applied it to my scalp and I love how soft and smooth it made my hair feel after I washed it. I left it in overnight which I normally don’t do with hair products because I find it so messy but this was so easy to leave on and the smell kept giving me soothing vibes. I absolutely love this product and I can’t wait to incorporate it into my nighttime routine going forward."

It smells lavender-y with a minty undertone—veeery calming and pleasant like the scent of a yoga room. The effects of the Indian plants, amla and bakuchi, in this serum is almost immediate. I use dry shampoos and oils A LOT, but even only using the serum twice has made my scalp feel less congested and itchy from product buildup. I feel like I’ve been shedding less hair too since my scalp is slowly becoming more habitable! It is recommended that I use it bi-weekly, but I’m not sure I can hold back from using it more than that."
