Each time, she wore this overpowering, musty, moth-bally scent that made me feel kind of sick.   I finally asked her what she was wearing as she left today, and she told me it was a scent called dedcool extra milk, and reiterated the spelling of d-e-d.  I just looked it up and had to share that I don't think this is as pleasant for bystanders as it is for the wearer. It is like a force field of 3 feet around the wearer, and hits you in the nose and does not let up. I can still smell it in my house an hour after she left.  It kind of reminds me of the old Dolce & Gabbana red, but it continues down a path of overly cloying, soapy, musty, chemical mothball that is hard to be around."

First, the sample, when sprayed, was a thick oily liquid that when rubbed on the wrist would warm up and felt slightly sticky (I associate this characteristic with oil-based perfumes) and had a very strong scent. I loved it! In contrast, the full sized bottle was very liquid-y, not thick or oily at all. It had absolutely no smell. I don't know if I got a knockoff from Sephora, if it was a bad-batch issue, or if DedCool changed the formula in the two weeks between when I got the sample and ordered the full size but I received a completely different product than I was expecting. I ended up returning it with no problems thankfully."

Long Summary: I initially purchased a travel-size bottle directly from Dedcool, and I loved its clean, fresh scent. Unfortunately, it faded quickly. Seeking a stronger fragrance, I ordered a sampler set from Dedcool, hoping that the included sample of Xtra Milk would deliver. Strangely, the Xtra Milk and the og Milk had little to no scent at all. Opting to forgo the 20% discount that came with the sampler, I instead bought the original Milk layering perfume from Sephora due to their return policy. Luckily, the Sephora bottle had a stronger aroma than the travel-size one from Dedcool. Since March 8, I‚Äôve used it extensively‚Äîlayering it with other perfumes and enjoying its fresh clean scent. I purchased a second bottle through Sephora and, to my pleasant surprise, this bottle smells even stronger than the first.   I reach for it almost daily, especially loving to spray it on the crook of my elbows. Just a friendly tip: avoid spraying it on clothes, as it may leave stains."

I appreciate the combination of amber, white musk, and bergamot. It is a comforting scent. On me, this fragrance was overpowering and did not work for me. I even tried layering it with other scents from the collection, but I was not able to get that wow that I desired from this fragrance. I would strongly suggest layering the fragrances to create your signature scents. It also is a great way to put a spin on the scent that you may not care for. Despite my disappointment, If you feel like you can't smell the Milk scent or want a stronger scent, then you should give the Xtra Milk a try. Overall I am very pleased with this brand, and I plan to try the candles and detergent soon. I would recommend the DedCool Xtra Milk to anyone who loves the Milk scent or lives for a stronger combination of the featured scents."

There's something about this scent that takes me back in memory. There's a very familiar scent to it. The Dedcool Xtra Milk has a very light smell to it but it lasts a long time. I could smell it on myself the next day. I sprayed it on my wrist and I did notice that it left a slightly sticky feeling.. maybe like the way essential oils feel when you apply them to your skin. It says its a genderless fragrance but in my opinion, it has more of a feminine feel to it. The notes of bergamot and musk are beautifully blended and together creates a really pretty and timeless fragrance. This scent will never go out of style."

I spray this on my family member, and it smell completely different on them than it did me. I like how this a scent you can layer with other complimentary scents. It smells more of a grown-up scent to have in your collection. This goes well with a body butter and the fragrance over top. I also like DedCool sleek packaging with barcode logo, it just looks nice sitting in my organizer. Overall, I would recommend this if you like musk scents and would give this four out five stars."

It fun to be a fragrance chemist and create different scents. Xtra Milk is a great base. By itself it gives me more summer vibes, but you can change it up when you start mixing it. I love that it‚Äôs vegan and cruelty free. There is just a whole new formulation to this that I think makes it so unique.

I‚Äôm pretty sure some people who are a minimalistic, would love it, but I wasn‚Äôt too fond of it. The the perfume smell is just OK. I wouldn‚Äôt say that it‚Äôs a smell that someone would say wow what are you wearing? it‚Äôs more of perfume that you would put on to go on a run to target or CVS and want to smell decent. I did have to sprayed a few times to get the product out, which was a bit annoying but not the end of the world. I sprayed it on my wrist but I do believe that if I would‚Äôve sprayed it on my clothes, it would have probably stained.  The perfume leaves a shiny sort of residue cast on the skin and I just don‚Äôt like the feeling that it left.  And the longer I left it on, I felt like my skin was burning. Nonetheless,  It is very subtle, but it‚Äôs not bad, but it would not be my first choice to grab if I was going out somewhere and I wanted my smell to linger.  Also, I did leave the perfume on for awhile and it started to smell like iron liquid."

I love the unique and beautiful scent of this perfume. I apply this perfume behind my ears and on my wrist. This perfume lasts all day long, and it doesn‚Äôt go away quickly. This odor also boosts my mood, and it boosts my self confidence. When I use this perfume, I feel alluring attractiveness. I love the cute and the pure bottle of Ded Cool Xtra Milk. I also love the box of this perfume. The bottle is very clean and easy to use. I also love the size of the perfume because it‚Äôs not too big and not too small. I love the fact that the bottle is made from pure, thin glass like most perfume bottles. However, if the bottle falls, it will instantly break. Overall, amazing perfume."

Turned on an alert and a week later received a notification that it was back in stock.I immediately added it to my cart and ordered it in 2 mins flat! While it took over a week to arrive, I started reading the reviews out of curiosity. Multiple people mentioned it smells like nothing and is basically just water. I thought their noses must be faulty because the sample smelled absolutely HEAVENLY.  I awaited delivery eagerly and when it arrived, imagine my shock when I sprayed it and it literally smelled like‚Ä¶ nothing. If I squinted my eyes I could MAYBE catch a whiff of the sample I receive but it‚Äôs 100000% not the same thing. This smells like they took one spray from the sample version and diluted the rest of the 1.7 oz bottle with water. So disappointing!! I‚Äôm so annoyed. Returning immediately. Such an inconvenience to have to coordinate a return, especially when I was SO excited about this purchase. Moral of the story: read (and believe) the reviews BEFORE you purchase. Also, shame on this brand!!!!!!!!"

I think I realized quickly that I was relatively nose blind after dry down because it's just one of those scents. I feel the same way with You and Another 13 but still didn't feel like either one nailed it. Milk NAILS it.   Milk is light, and the perfect compliment to any outfit/vibe. the amber is to die for but not too overpowering that you miss out on the other notes.
