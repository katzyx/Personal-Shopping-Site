You can use it sheer or build it up but as you build up he color your building up the luminosity then it could start to look funny over textured skin.  I personally use 2 layers of the blush but don‚Äôt need the highlighter but sometimes use 1 sweep Of both.  I use this blush duo all the time over any blush I‚Äôm using cuz your girl loves to glow."

I have a blush infatuation so their review made me do it!  Not mad at all.  The finish is flawless, does not emphasize texture and the Rose shade gives a natural flush on my fair complexion. Achieve a subtle look using a light hand and it is buildable.  The highlighter was my greatest hesitation and for no reason. No glitter just a lovely sheen, not high beam gleam - but I am sure you can build a more powerful glow if that‚Äôs your preference.  Packaging is very luxe.  Makes you feel special from the moment you take it out of the box through the application.  Wears well throughout the day.  Really love it!"

It doesn‚Äôt blend well, difficult to get pigment on the brush, and has huge chunky glitter. The highlight is marginally better but would still be the worst highlighter I‚Äôve ever used too. I don‚Äôt understand why this has been all over Instagram and liketoknowit. I plan on returning."
