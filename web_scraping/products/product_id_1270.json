The cream blends in really well and the powder is the perfect buildable consistency. I'd reccomend this to any and everyone looking for a fantastic cream and powder duo. The price is a little steep, but the amount of product you get makes up for it. Also, if it's in your means, I'd also go for the matching brush as it does all the work for you when applying it.

The powder bronzer is literally as pigmented as a children’s eyeshadow kit. I’m not kidding. At first I thought it was just buildable but literally digging into the pan is not buildable it’s just chalky.  The creamy part is so so patchy. I wore this out the first day and when I got home I couldn’t believe my forehead looked like that after just an hour of wearing it. It was so patchy and looked like I was experimenting with blotting some parts of my face with bronzer and leaving other parts empty. I thought it might have been my skin prep, so I changed my routine and it was still the same."

I am envious of those who made this product work, however that was not my experience. I tried She's Sculpted and even though it claims to have a cool undertone, the powder was still too warm and orange. The cream had great potential, but I could not get it to smooth out over my skin. Every time applied, no matter if I used a beauty blender or a brush, it came out splotchy on my skin. I love the two-product compact to minimize products in my bag. The idea was great, but the execution fell short with the formula for me. I will still try other products from this brand despite this product not working out for me. I returned."

I’m fair with a warm-golden undertone, and I fall under deep-autumn. I’d say the contour shade appears neutral on me and very natural looking. Not exactly warm, but cool tones may feel it’s not cool enough to work as a contour. The product itself, (shades together or alone) have a skin like finish and applied easily. But I agree, it can apply patchy, and the product is not suited for beginners. Technique is important, but corrections can be made.   I like the convenience of the product design, but I may not buy again. Opening the product itself is tricky, but easily doable if paying attention and are patient."
