			"review_text": "Let me start with the packing of this product; it is awful. First off, I don’t personally like the scrubber. The bristles of the scrubber is too flexible, too rubbery. It smells like it was so cheap to produce. I would prefer a scrubber that is more sturdy silicone than this rubbery material. Secondly, when the product itself comes out of the scrubber / bottle, you aren’t even getting the full amount of product as it pours out very slowly just due to the packaging, and the product will get stuck onto the bristles which is a waste of product. Lastly, the product itself doesn’t do anything for dry scalp and/or dandruff. It’s horrible. When I come out of the shower after using this shampoo and my regular conditioner, I still see my dandruff! This product doesn’t do anything to combat that meanwhile it is targeting to be a “detox” shampoo. This product does nothing to “detox” or properly clean your scalp."

			"review_text": "Great clean, terrible package like someone else said. I ended up using my handheld scalp massager. Two things I didn’t care for are the beads (it took a long time to rinse them all off) and the scent, it lingers after. It really doesn’t need extra scent as there is mint and menthol in the formula. It’s superfluous and can conflict with other scents in your routine. It’s more on the masculine side. Both the beads and scent make me want to return."

Smells refreshing, does a great job at exfoliating and clarifying the scalp and hair, and after the few times I've used it my hair hasn't been left really dry like some clarifying or exfoliating shampoos. But I hate the packaging. First off, the silicone massager is gimmicky - it's so tiny and attached to a large heavy tube, after a few seconds of attempting to use it I put it down and used my fingers. So it's unnecessary. I also find it difficult to dispense the shampoo - you have to rotate the bottom to open and close it, and I don't know if mine is just defective but it barely opens and I have to use a lot of strength just to get a bit of product out.   All in all, this would be five stars if they simplify the packaging to an ordinagry tube and dispenser. No need for the gimmicks or fancy openers."

However, it didn’t feel harsh at all. I was worried it would leave my hair dry/brittle but nope. Nice, clean, and super fresh, healthy. I like the scrubber/massager piece on the end. It doesn’t quite take the place of a full scalp massager (I have one that I love) but is definitely convenient and better than nothing. I received this for free for testing purposes but I’d probably buy this product again."

It has a unique jelly-like texture that spreads and lathers beautifully without having to use a lot of the shampoo and a fresh peppermint fragrance that sticks around for hours without being overpowering. It gently yet effectively removes and exfoliates my scalp from buildup while providing a nice cooling sensation, leaving my scalp feeling calm and refreshed. It also deeply cleanses and hydrates my hair without stripping it while helping to keep my excess oils under control and delivering a stunning shine. My hair and scalp have felt so soft, healthy, and nourished since I have been using this shampoo, and I will definitely continue to use it as the benefits are just that great!"

Other than that I recommend checking it out."

It almost has a minty scent to it, but it’s not overpowering or offensive. It’s great that you can twist the dispenser open or closed to avoid any leakage, and it does come with a scalp scrubber at the end to give extra lathering power. I’m sharing photos of my second day hair pre and post-wash. It’s clear that this shampoo does a great job cleaning my hair but still giving it that hydrated look and feel to it, so I feel comfortable using it a couple times a week to keep my oil at bay!"

Unfortunately I'm not the biggest fan of products with dissolving pearls, but overall still liked this product. Pro tip is to make sure to twist the cap to the off position when done. I'm conflicted on my feelings about the scrubber being attached to the bottle. Overall, I really like the scrub part, I felt like it was small enough to provide a good massage.

I think the scalp scrubber that is attached to the bottle is such a nice and unique touch, it was easy to hold and use and made it feel like I was getting a scalp detox at a salon or something. The scent of the shampoo was so pleasant and clean. Overall my scalp feels much cleaner, and this also looks aesthetically pleasing in my routine."

I have hair that’s on the thinner side and that’s quite long and this felt so fresh on the scalp. I will say when using the massaging tip it was a bit awkward with the length of the bottle but nevertheless I’ll definitely keep using! The smell was quite minty and felt invigorating on the scalp. No more dry scalp for me!"

			"review_text": "I was super excited to try out this detox jelly shampoo, especially because the product packaging looked amazing! After using it three times, I definitely noticed a difference in my hair. It felt less flaky and much more refreshed. One of the standout features of this shampoo is the cooling effect it provides when you’re rubbing it into your scalp with a scalp massager. It feels really nice and soothing. However, there was one aspect I didn’t particularly care for: the built-in scalp massager on the bottle. Initially, I thought it would be a feature I’d love, but I found that holding the entire bottle to exfoliate my scalp was a bit tricky. I just ended up using my own scalp massager instead. For the amount you’re getting at the price point, this is definitely a great product. If you tend to have a super flaky scalp and struggle with oil control, this shampoo can really help. Despite the minor issue with the built-in massager, I still think it’s worth trying out! 💙"
