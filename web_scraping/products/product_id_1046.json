			"review_text": "Utterly obsessed with this fragrance! It’s complex and unique and I found myself smelling my wrist over the course of the day over and over again. It starts off with an earthy fig that fades and blends into this gorgeous clean green yet musky scent. Lover is definitely one that will turn heads and make others ask what you are wearing. I only sprayed once and it lasted all day, so it is potent without the silliage being overbearing. I ordered the discovery kit to start but I will absolutely be ordering the full size because I can’t live without it."

It smells so good it puts me in a better mood. It's warm and woodsy, perfect for fall/winter. Plus the quality is excellent, it's super long lasting and strong without being too much. I don't wear it everyday but I keep it in my purse for whenever I'm having a rough day or just need a pick me up, it always cheers me up!"

From the moment I spritzed it on, I felt as if I had been whisked away to a dreamy, far-off destination, one where sunsets linger and every moment feels full of possibility. The inspiration behind this fragrance “a travel fantasy” comes through beautifully in its layered, evocative scent. The top note of luscious fig greets you with a ripe, juicy sweetness that feels like a warm embrace. As it settles, the flirtatious allure of jasmine sambac blooms, adding an airy yet intoxicating floral heart. The base is where the magic deepens, with sensual vetiver and arousing oud creating a rich, smoky warmth that lingers delicately on the skin. Wearing this fragrance made me feel confident, playful, and undeniably alluring, as though I were stepping into the role of a worldly adventurer with stories to tell. It’s a scent that evokes wanderlust and reminds me of places I’ve loved or long to visit."

It feels cozy, like being wrapped in a soft embrace, but also has this magnetic, sensual quality that slowly reveals itself.  What I love most is how Lover evolves throughout the day—it starts with that deep, woody warmth and then the floral jasmine and creamy sandalwood come through, making it feel both grounding and alluring. The inspiration behind it, the bond between two lovers, really comes through in the way it makes me feel—connected, confident, and a little bit mysterious.  The bottle is beautiful too—smooth, sleek, and eco-friendly, which adds a personal touch to the experience.  Overall, Lover is a timeless, gender-inclusive fragrance that feels both intimate and bold. It’s perfect for anyone who loves warm, woody scents that leave a lasting impression."

The scent did last throughout the day which was good! Overall not my favourite but very good quality perfume."

			"review_text": "I received this product free from @skeepers_us in exchange for my honest review.  The Maker Lover Eau De Parfum. This perfume is an earthy woody scent with hints of fig and jasmine. It’s vegan, cruelty free, contains no formaldehydes, contains no phthalates, and is a clean product.   It is quite a strong perfume. I was quite surprised how strong it is as soon as you spray it. You definitely get the woody scent to it. It reminds me of an earthy scent mixed with strong perfume. It’s not a bad scent, but for me, I may like it if it weren’t so strong. It almost felt a little overbearing. This could just be my scent preference, so I’d definitely recommend still giving it a try! That’s the fun unique part about scents, is there are SO many to try from to suit our personalities! #skeepers #themaker #themakerlover #lovereaudeparfum #perfume #scent #cologne #vegan #clean #fragrance #fig #jasmine #phthalatefree #formaldehydefree #crueltyfree #free #review #productreview"

It’s not too overpowering—just enough to add an exotic layer that makes the perfume feel sensual. This fragrance is perfect for anyone who loves woody scents with a twist of sweetness and floral allure.

It lasts quite well on the skin and clothes, most of the day for sure! There is a story behind and scent and bottle which is a really nice touch from a brand- though using this scent, I capture the idea of an intimate embrace and love story. The maker hotel uses inspiration from their hotel. I get elegant and sophisticated vibes wearing this- channeling a celebrity at a hotel haha As someone who typically goes for sweeter perfumes, I actually really enjoy this change. This is technically unisex which I could see, it does intertwine the scents in a very sophisticated way that can be seen from both sides.

It’s a creamy, woody scent and to me, the vetiver and oud really stand out. I’m not one to wear woody scents, but I would love to smell this on my boyfriend, if I had one, lol. I would 100% buy this for your husband, boyfriend, whoever. Alternatively, if you’re a woman who loves woody scents, you’ll love this. It is very strong and the lasting power is amazing. I sprayed it on a piece of paper and could smell it days after."

It is earthy but still seductive. I am a fan and would buy a larger bottle 1000%. It does smell like a less intense version of what the Cosmopolitan Hotel smells like, which I realize is niche but it's super true."

			"review_text": "Received sample of this recently. This is blended beautifully and very unique. Definitely unisex and I can see why many think this pulls masculine which is not something I typically reach for but surprisingly something about this I loved. The oud is very prominent but light fig note (which is more noticeable in dry down) gives it subtle sensual sweetness. I can see why some feel it’s a scrubber for those noses that are more inclined to generic heavily commercialized common fragrances that are not as complex. My husband complimented right away. I live in Miami and this surprisingly did well in heat but definitely see it performing better as fall/winter scent"

I detect zero fig in this. The opening is an extremely smokey, campfire-like oud. The dry down softens a bit, although this is not for everyone and definitely not crowd pleasing. I would consider this unisex at best. Try in store first."

For me, it definitely leans more masculine, but I would 1000% turn my head back around to see who was wearing it. It’s a very sexy fragrance that I will be giving to my boyfriend to try. You can tell it’s a high quality fragrance immediately. One spritz in the air and I could smell it throughout the room. Lovely fragrance, just not feminine enough for my liking, but I will be trying it myself as well to see if it could eventually be!! Fresh, woodsy, clean yet sensual. I imagine the hottest person in a romance book would wear this. My cat also could not stop sniffing the air?? Lol"

I should love it, I love all the notes in it (especially the fig), but I don't.  It's not bad, it's just not great on my body chemistry.  The oud comes out strong and overpowers everything else.  It also doesn't have a lot of staying power, so I can't really tell what it would smell like after the top note of oud fades away.  Maybe it smells nicer, but who knows, because I can't smell it at all.  Could just be my chemistry, though.  If you like these notes, I suggest you get a sample or a travel size bottle first.  It isn't what I expected."
