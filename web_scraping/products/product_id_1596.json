            "review_text": "As a beauty professional with over 25 years of experience, Iu2019ve tried countless cleansers. The Tata Harper Regenerating Cleanser stands out as a luxurious option. This 100% natural, non-toxic product is ideal for anyone looking for gentle exfoliation and deep cleansing in one easy step. Its creamy formula infused with apricot microspheres and BHAs is made from white willow bark. It helps provide a polished, radiant finish without being overly rough. Although I tu2019s an effective solution for all skin types, I especially love it for those of us with dull, uneven texture and pore congestion.  What I love most about this cleanser is its ability to refine and brighten the skin while maintaining its natural moisture barrier. The soft citrus and floral scent make every use feel like a spa experience. It also offers a blend of pomegranate enzymes and aloe vera which renew the skin gently while soothing any redness or irritation. For my clients with sensitive skin, I recommend using it 2-3 times a week as an exfoliant rather than a daily cleanser to avoid over exfoliation or dryness.   If youu2019re on a clean beauty journey or simply seeking high performance skincare, this is a great option. It works great as the first step in a morning or evening routine, it leaves the skin soft, smooth, and prepped for serums and moisturizers. If youu2019re serious about maintaining a radiant complexion and love products that combine efficacy with eco-luxury, the Tata Harper Regenerating Cleanser is worth the investment."

The texture was a welcomed suprise with very small grits in the gel to help gently exfoliate the skin. The cleanser was gentle but still helped to exfoliate the dead skin cells. I did not find it overly striping at all for my dry, sensitive skin. I like that this formula also has BHAs in the formula to help with a chemical exfoliation while simultaneously exfoliating with the physical apricot partials. The packaging of course is also very nice. The glass bottle is sleek and elegant and gives luxury. I would only use this scrub every other day at the most for my dry skin however I did love the effect it gave when using it with the waterlock moisturizer. Overall a great scrub"

I feel it opens up and cleans deeply my pores without stripping my skin like other exfoliators do. Itu2019s not only effective but also it smells unbelievable amazing! The bottle is a strong heavy glass with a nice pump. Itu2019s a really luxurious look and feeling. After trying Iu2019ve been incorporating into my routine for many days now and my skin hasnu2019t become dry. I totally recommended it. Not sure if someone with sensitive skin will react same way but my skin took it amazing."

The regenerating cleanser is a game changer for my combination skin. The packaging is so beautiful, soft and I love its green and yellow colors. I started by applying and massaging gently on my dry skin, until it turned white. The cleaner is creamy and grainy. The exfoliant part is so gentle and left my skin so very soft. I did not need to massage my face for too long for the cleaner to turn white, and then I added water which melted the cleanser. My skin was left extremely soft and absolutely matte, no shine to be seen. There was a bit of tightness but nothing to be worried about. The scent of the cleanser was sweet. I loved my experience!"

The physical exfoliation is so nice right now, especially  in the winter when I have some flaking skin and need to prep my skin surface before applying makeup. The smell is so nice and clean and reminds me of a fancy spa treatment. This regenerating cleanser does its job to clean my face and exfoliate the surface but is not irritating at all which is shocking because every other physical exfoliating cleanser that I have tried has made my face burn or itch or turn red. I like to use an oil cleanser as my first step and then switch between this and the clarifying cleanser to give my skin a break from the exfoliation. Using this in conjunction with the Tata Harper face mask and the other facial cleanser has made my pores look so clean and my face feels so glowy in the mornings!"

I have dramatically less flakes on my cheeks, as you can see in my before and after closeup.   The application is unique in that you apply the exfoliating cleanser to a dry face - I felt like this really amped up the polishing effect/feeling and it was a simple 30 seconds added to my routine.  I have been doing a double-cleanse by following up with the Tata Harper Clarifying Cleanser.   This product smells great, works quickly, and has delivered the results I was looking for.  It rinses clean and leaves my skin feeling smooth and looking soft and touchable. I am also happy to report that the exfoliants did not irritate or exacerbate my broken capillaries. I would recommend this product to any of my dry skin friends without hesitation!"

It's exfoliating since it has apricot seed powder yet very gentle, my skin feels smooth and very clean, not stripped (thank you kaolin clay) after washing.  After the initial use, I didn't apply moisturizer after to see if the cleanser would dry out my skin and make it oily later, but to my surprise it didn't. My skin felt hydrated and not dry nor oily. I love that it doesn't contain any dyes or fragrance, and they use fruit extract & essential oils for this, love the scent which makes me feel relaxed & calm. My pores look cleaner after 2 weeks of usage. I think my skin tone is more even & brighter. My breakout is less inflamed, which is my main concern when I try any new product, thank goodness that this is not the case. Finally, I love the glass bottle, i'm a sucker for anything glass, I feel fancy & indulged while using this."

The cleanser has a scent to it that I feel like reminds me of a fancy spa or salon. I have noticed my skin to feel much cleaner afterwards as well as polished. After implementing this cleanser into my morning and nighttime skincare routines for the past two weeks, I've noticed my pores to be far less pronounced. Additionally, I've also noticed the acne on my face reduce drastically which is great knowing this product is truly cleaning my skin properly. I highly recommend this for those with dry and sensitive skin as I did not have any irritation."

Iu2019ve always struggled with rough and textured skin no matter how many scrubs, moisturizers, etc I try. After one use of this, my skin felt so buttery smooth and soft and my foundation applied like a dream instead of the usual patchy mess. After continued use, my skin is brighter, pores are smaller and I have no more flakey skin! Another benefit Iu2019ve noticed is that with my dead skin gone, all my other skincare products are able to penetrate deeper and deliver better results. I think pictures are worth a thousand words and the difference is clear in my before and after pictures. If you struggle with flakey textured skin, this product, though pricy, is 100% worth the investment."

The beads inside the formula are not irritating or harsh and don't scratch up my face. I like to even mix this with their other face wash to get the benefits of both. The scent is also light and smells great, but it is something to note if you don't like too much fragrance in your face products. I only use the scrub 2-3 times a week even though it says you can use it daily. I like that is also has a chemical exfoliate."

My face was typically ashy white EVERY single time I washed my face until I tried the regenerating cleanser. I loved how visibly, bright, and radiant my skin was. This was a game-changer for my skincare routine. I disliked having to rely on thick moisturized all the time to keep my face moisturized. I learned from using this entire line that my first defense to treat dull and dry skin is using a high-quality cleanser. I absolutely loved this product and how it transformed my skin in a matter of days. It lathers up well, and a little bit goes a long way.

You can feel the grittiness of this product but at the same time it is gentle on the skin! The product has a very pleasant earthy citrus scent to it. The best part is, once you rinse it off, your skin seriously feels so soft and smooth. It has made the texture of my skin look so much better and my skin feels rejuvenated after using this scrub. It doesnu2019t leave my skin feeling tight or stripped. If you are looking for a product that leaves your skin feeling refreshed and radiant you absolutely need to try the Tata Harper Regenerating Exfoliating Cleanser."

However I shouldnu2019t have been concerned because Tata Harper delivered as always with their Regenerating BHA Exfoliating Cleanser. Packed full of high performance botanical ingredients that are not only 100% natural but also largely organic, this defoliating cleanser uses chemical and physical exfoliation to dissolve buildup, refine pores, and hydrate and plump skin. The formula is gentle enough to use every day to buff and polish dull, uneven skin revealing a radiant, healthy face. After two weeks of use, my skin looks brighter, smoother, and more hydrated. My pores even look smaller! Using it together with their resurfacing mask and clarifying cleanser has been an absolute game changer for my skin."

I have very oily skin and it gets rid of all my oil while giving me an even surface to put on other products.

I donu2019t know if itu2019s too soon to tell but I kind of see an almost so slightly brighter complexion. I tend to have a lot of texture because of my oily skin but Iu2019ve noticed that it is looking smoother. These colder months play tricks on me and dry out my skin so I feel like the thickness and hydrating properties have been helping to balance out whatever Mother Nature is trying to do. The only thing I donu2019t love is that because it is thick it feels like I have to use more water and massage my face more in order to get the product off more, other than that I am liking the product.

It has the signature Tata Harper floral scent. With sensitive skin I'm weary of fragrances, but this one is mild and pleasant making for a great addition. The bottle design, like the other Tata Harper cleansers, is top-tier! I absolutely love the glass bottle design. It makes it feel luxurious, which I would expect with this price point.

I love that the beads are not harsh on the skin and that the smell of this is my favorite among all the cleansers I have tried from the brand. You can visibly see the brightness that it gives. This cleanser is not harsh on the skin even if ai use it as a quick daily facial by leaving it on for 5 minutes before rinsing. If you have sensitive skin like me, do not hesitate to try this cleanser specially if you have acne prone skin as it might be the solution you have been looking for. Love this brand and its ideals.

I usually try to stay away from exfoliators as I feel like they just make my skin worse. This exfoliator has both physical and chemical exfoliators. Im not going to lie, I was concerned with the apricot microspheres, but to my surprise, they were extremely small and not jagged like I assumed. When I put it on my bare dry face, I felt the microspheres at work, but it did not hurt at all. I also noticed a scent that I actually liked but did not linger on the skin. The BHA chemical exofliation comes from white willow bark and after a couple of days, I could see the difference. My face looked brighter, felt softer and best of all did not break out from it. Though this is a gentle exfoliator, I now do not use it every day as my medication is pretty strong, but that is my unique circumstance. For normal everyday people, I would say it is okay to use every day for a gentle exfoliation. However, since everyone is different, I would just recommend using however many times a week you see fit for you."

This cleanser is a cream based cleanser - I didnu2019t notice a scent with it and it does have physical exfoliant. The beads are very very small and reminded me of pumice but they are actually made of apricot seed powder. I would give this 5 stars but I found the grit hard to remove at the sink. There are also AHAs in this cleanser for chemical exfoliation and brightening. I noticed my skin did appear much lighter and brighter after using this! I think this would be great for any skin type since it is so gentle but particularly for someone with dry or aging skin since it's creamy and moisturizing.

The olive oil liquid crystal complex moisturizes and softens the skin. It is suitable for daily use, depending on the tolerance level of your skin, however, I always recommend to start from once a week and build up from there to protect the skin's barrier.

The physical and chemical combination exfoliation aspect of the Tata Harper Regenerating Cleanser feels so lightweight and gentle when lathered onto the skin. My skin feels thoroughly clean and ready for the next step. I enjoy it so much more than the exfoliator I usually use and will be switching to this exfoliator with apricot microspheres and BHA from white willow bark. The scent of this cleanser is fragrant botanical and sweet. I love it. I even used it gently on sunburn, and it didn't hurt at all. In my opinion, it helped. I wish my before picture was right before starting use instead of a few days ahead, because I broke out like crazy -- BIG zits on both cheeks, my forehead, above my lips -- and this cleanser cleared me up almost entirely in a week in combination with the clarifying cleanser. The bottle design evokes timeless class. I have no other product in my master bath, despite having other luxury brands, which is as aesthetically pleasing as the Tata Harper packaging. I like that the design is such that you can instantly see how much product is left with the see-through glass bottle. I am moving much more toward eco-friendly packaging and containers, and glass will always have more recyclability than plastic, another win for Tata Harper. Vegan, cruelty-free, and Forest Stewardship Council approved packaging. For all skin types. Next-generation skincare, indeed."

Depending on your skin sensitivity, I don't know if this would work as a daily cleanser for everyone. It might be nice to alternate this with a more simple cleanser. I can see how this would be a good fit for many skin types. It's great to clear clogged pores or schluff off dry skin. It's a really nice gel cleanser consistency that easily suds up. It does have a rather strong medicinal/eucalyptus/menthol type of scent that does linger on the skin. I don't mind it but others might. The packaging is very luxe and feel fancy but it makes me nervous having glass in the shower as I'm clumsy. I am going to enjoy using this up but I do not plan on repurchasing just due to the price."

As a skincare professional, cleansers are a non-negotiable in your skincare routine and a good one is hard to find.

It is a combination of physical exfoliation and chemical exfoliation so it polishes and refines the texture of your skin without being too abrasive or harsh. The Regenerating Cleanser has amazing ingredients to help rejuvenate the skin and to draw out impurities. I tend to have oily/ combination skin on the more sensitive side and being able to use this as a daily exfoliant has really changed my outlook on exfoliating everyday as I found it to be too harsh for my skin. The packaging itself is luxurious and the price point is also something to note if you're in the mood to treat yourself for a gift.

I knew this wasn't like other cleansers the first time I used it. The results are visible right away. The texture is thick and creamy, and it also has these very small apricot microspheres that work as exfoliant beads. They remove dead skin cells gently, without being too rough or irritating. It has just the right amount of both physical and chemical exfoliants to clean and refresh my face without making it red or itchy. I also love the smell of it which is good. The product can be used daily to cleanse and exfoliate the skin, buffing, and polishing to make it look healthy, glowing, nourish, and refresh the face. It also works great for my clogged skin.

It was so fresh scent. I felt like I was enjoying at luxury spa.  This cleanser is for daily exfoliator because it has very light level of exfoliating. However I only use 2-3 times as it has BHA will get my skin dry. When I gently scrubbed and massage on face, my skin had no any reaction, no irritation. The exfoliator polished and buffed with BHA and apricot microspheres to remove my dead skin and blackhead. My skin felt smoother and tightener. The pores looked like tightener.  Be attention on color of cleanser, for best used you take a small amount onto face and neck and gently scrub until cream turns white, then rinse with warm water. I saw the value of product in the way it was packaged and stored. As well as their green commitment. I totally trust the product. **This review was collected as part of a promotion."

I will say that the cleanser reminded me of the days of the apricot scrub based off the rough texture and how it felt on my skin.

I use it both morning and night, applying a small amount to damp skin and massaging it in circular motions. The cleanser lathers up nicely and rinses off easily. After using it for a while, I could notice that my skin complexion is much brighter, my pores are clear and reduced the frequency of breakouts. One thing to note is that this cleanser is quite concentrated, so a little goes a long way. This justifies the higher price point, as the bottle will last you a good amount of time even with regular use."

            "review_text": "As someone who's always on the lookout for new skincare products to improve the appearance of my skin, I was very excited to try out this Regenerating Cleanser by Tata Harper. For reference, I have combination skin that is acne-prone. I have been using this cleanser daily in the morning for about two weeks now. When I use it, I usually apply it to my dry skin and let it sit for a minute or two before rubbing it in and rinsing it off. Overall, I've been really impressed with this cleanser! Since I started using it regularly, I've definitely noticed a reduction in clogged pores, and I think it has also helped to even out my skin's appearance. The cleanser looks luxurious and smells clean and fresh. It contains tiny natural exfoliants and I love how it feels on my skin. Since I have combination skin that leans dry, I often struggle with exfoliating cleansers, because they strip my skin and leave it overly dry. However, I have not had that issue at all with this cleanser and instead found that it leaves my skin feeling balanced and clean. It's also a major plus that the cleanser is vegan and cruelty-free. Overall, I would very highly recommend this cleanser!"

It provides gentle physical and chemical exfoliation with BHA. I found that the exfoliating apricot microspheres are not abrasive at all compared to St. Ives so itu2019s gentle enough to use twice daily. However, your skin may be more photosensitive so applying SPF is a must. The way I use this is by applying it to dry skin and gently massaging my face for at least twenty seconds. The cleanser turns white to let you know that itu2019s time to rinse. After, my skin feels so much more smoother and my pores are noticeably smaller. I experience hormonal breakouts, but using this helps immensely with combating the blemishes before they form. This cleanser was formulated with 100% natural ingredients such as pomegranate enzymes and pink grapefruit, which is why it smells citrusy and botanical. I love it!"

This is the best exfoliating cleanser I have used thus far using natural BHAs (willow bark extract), pomegranate enzymes and apricot seed powder. It is gentle yet effective. Great for sensitive skin and can be used every day! The citrus scent smells divine and wakes me up in the morning. I add it to dry skin and massage in circles and let the apricot powder buff and polish your skin then rinse with warm water. It thoroughly cleans my pores and leaves me with bright plump skin that feels soft and silky. It helps my serum and moisturizer absorb better as well. I have also tried this as a 5 minute mask with Tata Harper's Resurfacing Mask and the results are phenomenal! The beautiful green glass bottles scream luxury! I love everything about this brand!"

On my first try I realized that this is a physical exfoliator and I tend to stay away from those because of my sensitive skin. However, I was pleasantly surprised that it was not abrasive and quite gentle on my skin. It comes in a luxurious pump bottle which makes it convenient to use. I have been using 1 squirt twice a week at night and have been enjoying it. The texture is very interesting, you put it on dry face and massage it and then add water and it turns white leaving your face clean and not stripped. It is not very heavily scented but it does have added fragrance in it so if you are sensitive to fragrance, this will not be for you.

I have heard of Tata Harper, but have not yet used anything from them until now.  I love that this cleanser is a vegan and cruelty free product. There is little to no scent with this cleanser and the scent I do smell is spa like and very luxirous. The texture was not what I was expecting, in a good way. It is super creamy with nice physical exfoliant in it and is very spreadable. 1 accidentally used way too much my first time applying, so it is nice to know a little goes a long way with this. I mistakenly applied this to wet skin rather than dry but did still get the product to turn white. Following this I used the product as intended and still did not need a lot of it to get the product worked into my neck and face.  As someone with dry skin, I am often hesitant to use exfoliants due to it being too harsh on my skin. With this Tata Harper cleanser, my first use I did notice my skin felt a bit stripped of moisture and almost burning. However, I adjusted my usage to every couple of days and with a moisturizer after this made my skin feel really nice. I look forward to continuing using this when my skin needs a little extra exfoliation."

Tata Harpers Regenerating Cleanser is my first experience with the brand. With the higher price tag that this product carries, I was excited to try it out and truly put a luxury brand to the test. Upon first impression I was very pleased with the packaging. Both the box and the bottle were very sturdy and a lot nicer than your typical packaging. I was also very pleased with the scent of the product, it has a pleasant apricot like smell which is perfect for the summer season. I have dry, red, and flakey skin as you can see in my before and after pictures. This product has definitely helped with the texture of my skin and so far has been gentle enough to use daily. Overall I would give this a sold 4 out of 5 stars. The price point is my only issue. Otherwise I would recommend for a skincare newbie or skincare fanatic!"

Although this cleanser does contain a physical exfoliant, it is very finely milled and housed in a creamy and nourishing cleanser. Together these have made my skin look much more bright and clearer than before I began using it. My two cautions with this product would be that it does have a slightly prohibitive price point, which makes it different to maintain in a daily routine. The other is that it had a slightly botanical/ foral scent that could be a bit much for those sensitive to fragrances or scents"

I have sensitive skin and eyes, but it did not irritate me at all. I have rough and dry skin and itu2019s been left feeling so soft after the first use, which says a lot. I definitely feel a noticeable difference since introducing the cleanser.

First, the bottle packaging looked so luxurious, and it was made by a vegan cruelty brand. It has been my skincare staple, the cleanser. As I have sensitive skin, I did not breakout. It has a citrusy smell, but it is manageable. Actually, I really love it. The microbeads help to exfoliate my skin, remove some of my dead skin, and actually lessen my black heads. I feel my skin slightly dry after, but it is so manageable. It is so amazing that I noticed the changes in my skin after how many times I've used the clenser. Also, I feel my skin is more hydrated and glowy. My skincare routine is lacking without this regenerating cleanser."

I love to switch up my routine with different formulas because my dry skin has so many different issues of dryness going on. I like to use an exfoliant in the AM and am loving this regenerating cleanser. I think it's the fragrance that makes me the most excited(obviously second to the skin care benefits lol) this has a huge burst of citrus-y Pink Grapefruit and definitely smell the Bergamot(which I love)and it seems to boost my morning mood a bunch. I can really tell the difference between this and other facial exfoliating cleansers. I noticed how plump and moisturized my skin felt after the first use. My skin felt so much smoother and it flaked away my rough patchy dry spots.  After a week of daily use I saw subtle changes in my skin.  -I didn't have to use as much moisturizer. -My fine lines and pores looked less noticable. -My skin looked waay more hydrated.  -Holy Smokes the softness!!! -My makeup laid so much smoother on my face. -My skin did not feel stripped(most importantly) or abused.  I think the ingredients deliver exactly what they claim. A soft delicate exfoliation from the Pomegranate Enzymes, White Willow Bark and Apricot microspheres. I do think though this will be my summer only cleanser because my winter skin NEEEDS this kind of exfoliant.  I recommend this cleanser especially if you love a crisp, creamy citrus scent. I know it sounds silly, but a beautiful bonus is when it comes to skin care is how pretty the look on your bathroom vanity LOL! The attention to detail and the gorgeous green brings an accented level of FANCY It's eye catching!"

The only small thing that I didn't enjoyed much is the very strong fragrance of orange peel.

During my home renovation projects my skin's texture has declined drastically and I've tried multiple products to help combat this issue and while some will work initially, they tend to stop working. Then I'm stuck scrubbing my face with a cloth to have my skin feel smooth again (do not do this!). Tata Harper's Regenerating Cleanser emerged as my saving grace. Infused with BHAs from white willow to exfoliate and coral clay to unclog pores, this cleanser tackled the grime which accumulated from the messiness of renovations. My skin feels smooth and the cleanser adds much needed hydration and pore cleansing at the same time.  There is a grapefruit scent which smells absolutely delicious, transforming my skincare routine into a spa-like experience even though my current life is chaotic and messy, much needed self care. The scent is really grounding as well and calms my nerves. The green glass bottle not only exudes luxury but also adds an eco conscious aspect as glass is much more recyclable and better for the environment than plastics, this is a huge bonus for me. Additionally, which sets this cleanser apart is its commitment to natural ingredients, 100% from natural origins and with over 80% sourced from organic farms. Knowing that it's Cosmo organic certified by Ecocert Greenlife provides assurance of its authenticity and its significance in clean beauty. I appreciate when brands make significant efforts to be better for us, and our planet. In conclusion, this is a life saver of a product for those who love their skin, love the environment, and love products that work as they say they will."

I was so excited to try this new product that is a cleanser and has a mild exfoliating action. I love this brand - all Tata products have all-natural ingredients like apricot seed powder, pomegranate enzymes, and willow bark extract. I love the packaging and how cute the bottle is. You just need a little and it turns white when rubbed on and easily absorbs in the skin - then you rinse and it gave amazing results. I have big clogged pores and it worked well to clean and mildly exfoliate. I feel my skin looks glowing, hydrated and yet so clean. It really doesnu2019t have much smell but is pleasant and would be great on even the most sensitive skin , highly recommended and will try on my customers for facials!"

I follow up after exfoliating with my normal skincare routine consisting of toner, serum, eye cream, face cream, face oil and sometimes a face mist for extra hydration. My skin has been noticeably more glowy and radiant. I look forward to using this cleanser for a longer term to see the u2018afteru2019 results!"

It comes in a luxurious thick glass bottle with a pump dispenser that keeps things mess free and a light apricot fragrance that I find to be so relaxing and non-bothersome. The texture is also on the thicker side, but it's lightweight and applies smoothly without causing me any irritation or without drying my skin out. It gently yet effectively exfoliates my skin, buffing away the dead skin cells while effortlessly cleaning the dirt and grime out of my pores. It works so well at keeping my pores clean and clear while also keeping the build-up at bay. I love that it also helps to break up makeup and sunscreen without any rough scrubbing. After using this cleanser for a few weeks, I am left with refined pores and a bright, smooth, and healthy complexion. This is definitely a product I will continue to purchase even though the price is a little steep as it checks all the right boxes!"

After using this cleanser, my skin feels noticeably softer, smoother, and more radiant. The exfoliating action helps to unclog pores, refine texture, and promote cell turnover, revealing a fresh and luminous complexion underneath.

Coming from the days of the peach walnut scrub (haha), I have gotten better about spacing it out and not completely destroying my skin with exfoliation. This cleanser really is the answer to my exfoliation/skincare prayers with both physical and chemical exfoliation properties. 100% natural ingredients mean that there are no harsh chemicals, only ingredients like pomegranate enzymes and apricot microspheres that work together to give you the smoothest, brightest, and plumpest skin. While diminishing pores, this cleanser also leaves your skin hydrated. I have had no rosacea breakouts or irritation with this cleanser either. The fragrance is so nice as well. I love everything about this cleanser and would recommend it for everyone!"

Iu2019ve worked in the cosmetics and skincare industry for twenty years now and have seen it develop and change so much. This cleanser I wouldnu2019t really classify as a cleanser. Itu2019s really an exfoliant. It smells great and is very effective but itu2019s way to harsh to be marketed as a cleanser. I can easily see people over using it twice a day and over exfoliating their skin and damaging the moisture barrier with this product. The texture of the product and packaging are great though and I love the product. I really just think it needs to be rebranded as an exfoliating treatment product and not a cleanser."

I have recently been using the Regenerating Cleanser by Tata Harper. This cleanser comes in a 4.1 fl oz/ 125 ml glass bottle. This product is definitely a 2 in 1 product that works as both a cleanser and an exfoliator. And honestly I am blown away by the results. In just a short week of using this cleanser, I can feel and see a difference in my skin. My skin feels healthy and looks fresh.  This cleanser is light brownish and orangish in color and has a very fresh, citrusy scent that I found to be very soothing. I use this cleanser in the night time. It is very easy to use. I use two pumps of this cleanser and gently start massaging this on my face. The cleanser has a very creamy yet grainy texture and starts turning white after massaging on the face. After massaging on my face for about 30 seconds, I add a few drops of water and keep further massaging on my face. After 30 more seconds I rinse it off with warm water.  I really like how my skin feels after using this cleanser. My skin feels extremely clean, soft and smooth after using this cleanser. This cleanser not only helps to remove all the dead skin cells but also refreshes and brightens my skin. It is gentle enough to use every single day revealing glowy shiny skin.  This has become one of my favorite cleansers. And I highly recommend it to others as this will definitely leave your skin soft, supple, smooth and hydrated.  **This review was collected as part of a promotion."

This cleanser is highly recommended for people who have dull, uneven, or congested skin. I instantly  fell in love with this amazing exfoliating cleanser! Tata Harper is the ultimate gold star standard in luxury clean natural beauty! I love Tata Harper Regenerating Cleanser! The scent of this cleanser immersed me in power of nature and botanicals! It has a beautiful natural herbal plant smell of the roots, stems, and absolute essence of every single natural ingredient in the bottle that is very calming creating a total sensory natural spa experience! The Tata Harper Regenerating Cleanser has a rich creamy texture but also has gentle exfoliants of apricot microspheres and BHA from white willow bark that left my skin radiantly glowing immediately after use! I loved this sensory experience of this cleanser as I felt like I was receiving a natural spa face treatment but at home! This all natural cleanser is incredible because 100% of the total ingredients are from natural origin and 82% of the total ingredients are from Organic Farming. The Tata Harper Regenerating Cleanser uses pomegranate enzymes, sunflower seed oil, and phytic acid to dissolve buildup. Then this beautifully crafted cleanser refines the pores with coral clay, pink grapefruit, and bergamont! To keep the skin plump, youthful and hydrated , this cleanser also contains aloe vera, crystalline coconut, and coconut liquid crystals! Use this cleanser day and night but probably a good idea to always wear sunscreen while using this cleanser because if the BHA exfoliants. I noticed my pores are less visible, my uneven skin texture is softened, and my skin overall looks brighter and more radiant! It is definitely a well crafted high quality product! I highly recommend Tata Harper Regenerating Cleanser (BHA Exfoliator) for beautiful, soft, radiant skin!"

Your skin feels so fresh and clean and light after rinsing off. I used this as directed on dry skin but also wanted to try it while in the shower on days I am rushing. I applied to wet skin and still had amazing results. I found that less is more with this product when using. 1 pump to not even a full pump was just enough. I highly recommend this product for those needing that deep clean with big results but gentle exfoliation."

I was using other products in the interim but nothing I found did the trick. I have really sensitive skin, as well as dry and flaky, often red patches. This is gentle enough I can use it daily, but I typically use it every other day. It gets rid of dead skin, but is so gentle. It doesn't make my face red, sting, feel too tight, or dry afterwards. I don't use it dry however - I dampen my face a little first. This leaves my skin feeling rejuvenated and refreshed, smooth, moisture enough that I won't flake, and my skin actually appears dewy now. My husband has been using it too, and he's seen a big improvement in his skin and blemishes which due to a hormone imbalance and medical condition - has been problomatic for years. This does the trick and keeps blackheads from forming."

            "review_text": "More of a scrub than a cleanser, this is one I wouldn't dream of using twice daily - it's just far too much exfoliation for me. In here you have both a manual exfoliator (Apricot seed powder) and a chemical exfoliant (Willowbark - high in BHA). The cleanser comes in a elegant green glass bottle and is a citrus-y smelling lotion cleanser. The Apricot seeds in it, despite how it might appear in the pictures, are very finely milled, we're definitely not talking St Ives here! I apply just over 1 pump of it onto my dampened face, massage it in and then rinse off. Admittedly all that exfoliation does help clear my pores, but if I do it every day I end up with some slightly red patches for a few minutes, so twice weekly seems to work out best for me. Now the good news is that because it's a partly oil-based cleanser, the formula isn't drying, despite its potent combination of exfoliants. But on the other hand it also does not foam and isn't the easiest of cleansers to rinse off, being oil-based. Every time I use it I feel as though some residue is left behind on my skin and requires either a second cleanse with something else, or otherwise a toner and cotton pad. What you end up with is a cleanser that's more geared to non-sensitive, drier skin types that require the extra hydration. Love the ingredients, as I do with every TH product I've tried, but not sure if this is one that I'd be rushing out to re-purchase once it's finished.   ~ My Sephora Top 7 must-have list ~  (My top 7 must-have beauty products of all time, focusing mainly on my purchases at Sephora)  1.

I love the pump, and not having to fumble with a putting a lid back on a tube while holding product in my hands. Within a week or so of daily use, my breakouts have been more under-control and I haven't been getting as oily.

I was not disappointed in any way and this is now my absolute favorite cleanser that I use both day-and-night. You start off applying it on dry skin and massage to exfoliate. The beads are very fine and gentle. Then you add water and continue cleansing and rinse.  My skin was clean without being stripped and it instantly felt soft and smooth.  It was also soothing and provided moisturization.  No tightness or irritation occurred.  The bottle itself has a luxe look and is made of glass.  I appreciate that because glass is much more eco-friendly.  I also really like that it comes in a pump and all ingredients are natural.  As a reference, I have oily, blemish prone skin.  I definitely recommend  to all."

The tiny apricot particles didn't feel harsh on my skin, and the fragrance is very light, citrusy. I think it provides a luxurious experience. Although it is recommended to use a generous amount of this cleanser, I think you don't need a lot of it. This cleanser does a great job in removing the dead skin cells and making my skin look radiant and healthy. It doesn't leave my skin dry or feeling right. I prefer to use this cleanser 3x a week to avoid over-exfoliation.

This one does none of that. It's super gentle, but still does the trick of sloughing away dead skin cells leaving my skin super soft. No dryness, no redness, no hyper-sensitivity.

When I purchased this cleanser around two weeks ago, my acne had been the worst that it has been in a while. After using this consistently both morning and night, my skin has COMPLETELY changed. My acne has significantly gone down, and my face feels so glowy, hydrated, and clean 24/7. I have oily/combination skin, and although this product is suggested for dry skin, I find that it cleans my skin well while also maintaining moisture and hydration. Bottom line, I absolutely love this cleanser and will be purchasing the larger size once I'm out of the travel size. SO worth it!"

I use a retinol cream at night so this is an important step to not look dry and flaky during the day.  It also washes off without a struggle as some exfoliator products can be a pain to wash off outside the shower. It is very fragrant as Tata Harper products are.

I actually like the bright, citrus scent and I'm usually not fan of products with a scent. It was too overpowering and smelled nice and fresh. I think that the exfoliation level wasn't too harsh, which is good since you're using this every day twice a day. But I think I would have preferred the product if it wasn't a physical exfoliant and a chemical exfoilant, which can be over-stripping.

I love the cleanser, but will be using it on my hands and feet much more often than I will on my face, specifically because of the apricot microspheres in the formula.

It's a light formula with teeny tiny exfoliating beads to help clean the gunk out of your pores. It has an amazingly relaxing citrus smell that makes you feel like your sitting on a beach. When using, you want to carefully scrub your face otherwise you can irritate your skin. It is made for daily use if you desire, though I'll be using it 2/3x a week. You come out on the other side with smooth, soft to the touch skin that smells like an orange. Yummy. This was gifted by Tata Harper in exchange for my honest opinion."

The fragrance doesnt smell fake either, it definitely has a natural smell.   The cleanser is a mid level exfoliant from my experience with other products, which is prefer. I want a product that actually exfoliates but isnt harsh like those products with walnut shavings.   Overall, this is a really nice product that I think normal to oily skin types would enjoy.

The packaging is smart and effective, a pump that gives the right amount of cleanser, that looks grainy and smells citrusy and heavenly. I damped my hands to create a small lather and washed my face, it exfoliates softly as it said and left my skin soft and bright and moisturized. I absolutely love this!

While this is a physical exfoliator, I find it to be relatively gentle and it leaves the skin feeling soft and not stripped.  NOTE: If you have sensitive skin, you should know that this cleanser does have some essential oils in it. If you know that your skin doesn't respond well to essential oils, this might not be one that you will like.  I normally try to avoid essential oils in my skincare because my skin doesn't normally respond well to them but I haven't had any issues with this cleanser.  I gave this cleanser 4 out of 5 stars because I think it would work for more people if it didn't have essential oils in it!"

Second my face feels refreshed and looks brighter. However the citrus scent is a bit too much for me. It's so strong that I had to hold my breath a little while applying. I don't really mind a citrus scent but one that's not so strong. I love the way my skin looks and feels after using but I don't think I would use again in the future due to the scent being so strong.

Tata Harper's Regenerating Cleanser is  100% natural cleanser, 83% organic ingredients, free from SLS, synthetic dyes and fragrances ~ and made right here in the USA in the great state of Vermont, using ingredients sourced from their farms.  Not only does this have non harmful surfactants, this also contains seed powders to help physically exfoliate while willow bark extracts have a chemical exfoliating benefit, due to their natural source of BHA.  This also has kaolin to help purify your skin.  I can use this two ways, as I would a regular cleanser ~ applying to my damp skin and washing my face with it OR for deeper exfoliation, apply to dry skin, massage gently and then rinse off  This has a wonderful  citrus herbal scent and it is a peachy-pink cleanser with the little bits of exfoliating powders as a texture.  This doesn't dry out my skin & my skin looks more clean  and bright while feeling soft & smooth. It is a gentle exfoliating cleanser and I would recommend it for oily and combo/oily skin!"

I put two pumps into my palm and apply directly to bare skin, concentrating more on problem areas. The texture is creamy and soft to the touch. The scent is light and citrusy u2013 I love it! The scrub component in this cleanser is apricot microspheres that are not harsh on your skin but effective. You don't need to scrub hard, just cleanse gently and it will get all the dead skin cells and debris off leaving your face very soft and supple. I have noticed a huge difference after only a few days of using this cleanser. My skin is clearer and the blotches of dry skin are gone. It feels perfectly smooth, healthy-looking, hydrated and soft as silk. I love that all Tata Harper Skincare products are vegan, free of harsh chemicals, and come in recyclable packaging. It went above and beyond my expectations. Highly recommend this product to anyone as it is great for any skin type."

I think applying a moisturizer after scrubbing would help with the  redness. Overall I loved this product and will definitely be looking to purchase Tata Harper products in the future. This product was gifted by Tata Harper skincare."

Although the cleanser at first appears like a cream, as soon as you apply it to your skin you can feel the super fine apricot powder that supplies the physical exfoliation. Itu2019s definitely nothing like St. Ives or any other large, rough exfoliant; this is super gentle and great for everyday use. After using this, my skin is baby soft, smooth, and radiant, without being overstripped. Definitely a winner! PS - remember to apply this to dry skin in order for it to work properly."

Then I rinse it off with warm water. My skin feels so soft and smooth and energized and looks brighter and has a nice glow after using it. The cleanser does not make my skin feel tight or dry. I love how easily this cleanser removes dead skin cells, make up and impurities. This regenerating cleanser is like having a luxurious pampering spa treatment right at your home.  I love that this product is free of toxins, fillers, artificial ingredients, synthetics, and GMOs. This product is vegan, cruelty-free, and comes in recyclable packaging. Highly recommend this regenerating cleanser!"

The bottle is sleek and stylish, and it looks to be high quality. I was a bit taken back at the strong citrus scent. While it was fresh and bright, it almost reminded me of an orange cleaner. The dry application was something that I wasn't used to but didn't take away from the application. The product went on smooth and lathered pretty well. There was a light abrasiveness but not as much as you would find in a sugar or similar scrub. Overall after the first few days of application I am not overly impressed. For the higher price tag I was expecting my skin to feel better after use. My skin felt clean but slightly dry and coarse (which was suprising after reasing other reviews) It is not something I would probably purchase for myself but I will give it a few more days to see if it improves over time."

The fresh citrusy scent combined with the very light exfoliation is the perfect wake up call. After cleansing my skin is smooth and soft, perfectly prepared for my next stage of skincare. Just as it is named, the regenerating cleanser, I truly feel regenerated.  I have tried many luxury face cleansers and this is by far the best as a morning cleanser (I have never used this to take off makeup). I am surprised to see any negative comments about this product as it is quite simply outstanding."

My skin is the worst possible combination type of dry, oliy, scarred, breakout-prone, and just everything at once - you name it. There are very, very few products that my skin will like and not break out from - and this exfoliating cleanser is one of them. Iu2019ve used many exfoliating cleansers before (both 100% organic and not-so-natural ones) and they were all either not cleansing enough or too harsh on my skin. This regenerating cleanser hits a sweet spot right in the middle, exactly where it should be. It cleans my skin deeply enough to leave it very clean and refreshed but it does so without harsh abrasiveness (the size of the micro-beads isnu2019t large enough to be abrasive to the skin) . It leaves my skin neither dry nor oily, but balanced just right. I use it 2-4 times a week before bedtime, followed by a moisturizer or serum that I know wonu2019t break me out. My skin looks a lot better and feels a lot softer and smoother right the next morning. I am now thinking of purchasing the companyu2019s sampler set of their other products; particulary interested in their moisturizers and serums. I also love the fact their ingredients are natural because it puts my mind at ease knowing Iu2019m not using dangerous / toxic chemicals on my skin. Maybe this is the major reason why the product works so well. Needless to say, I ditched all my other cleansers! But I just WISH the price tag wasnu2019t so high! :u2019u2019("

On top of that I was spending a ton of money and time trying out different projects and methods to try and improve it. So I went out on a whim and bought the whole Tata Harper line to replace my current regimen. I purchased the regenerating cleanser, floral essence, resurfacing serum, and hyaluronic acid moisturizer. After first use I could tell my skin looked plumper. I made sure to take my time to really work the serum and moisturizer into my skin. When I awoke next morning I saw a HUGE difference in redness, brightness, and acne scarring. I was so surprised. This stuff is awesome. Doesnu2019t smell bad. Seriously just buy it. Iu2019m in love.

On slightly wet skin I apply a very thin layer and emulsify and leave on for about 3 minutes before I wash off. My skin feels so smooth after that I get excited about using it. It makes the rest of your skincare work so much better. I love using first thing in the morning because the scent is so light and refreshing.

My skin feels amazingly smooth after daily use of cleanser and using the mask 2-3 times a week. I have noticed a major difference in my skin since starting using this regimen. Pores, greasiness and little hormonal breakouts or dietary breakouts on my chin or on my nose are my biggest concern. The breakouts go away quickly now. With consistent usage, I notice that my pores stay clearer longer which helps with the breakouts as well. I rarely need to use pore strips anymore and I would need to use them twice weekly to keep my pores clear previously. I can't say enough good things about this pricey product! After cleansing, I follow with a Vitamin C serum (Ole Henriksen or Tatcha), Caudalie Blemish Control Infusion serum (BHA), mineral fluid sunscreen and either Tatcha Water Cream or Kiehl's Cannabis Sativa Seed oil."

And itu2019s the only cleanser Iu2019ve used that leaves my skin 100% clean after using a pad with toner (the pad comes out clean). With all my other cleansers, I have to use my Foreo Luna for the pad to come out clean. If I rinse my face without the Foreo Luna, the pad doesnu2019t come out clean. So for that reason, Iu2019ll continue to rebuy this cleanser even though itu2019s very pricey. Every time I wear makeup, I double cleanse. The first cleanse is with a cleansing oil & I use this Tata Harper cleanser as the 2nd cleanse."

Itu2019s what Iu2019ve been looking for! Iu2019ve been searching for a cleanser that is gentle enough for my sensitive skin, but strong enough to help with my dry, flakey skin especially on my cheeks, around my mouth. Iu2019ve been using it for a week and Iu2019ve seen great improvement. I like the scrubby feeling and I get that from the apricot powder. No need to scrub your face off. Just massage your face in gentle, circular motions. Oh, and the grapefruit scent is delightful and uplifting! The product is also 100% natural and 82% of the total ingredients are from organic farming. How amazing is that?! Yes, itu2019s a high price tag, but Iu2019m happy to support a company that makes clean, natural, farm-to-face products. Go to Sephora and get a sample! Everyone is different, so itu2019s the only way to ensure itu2019s right for you."

Since company is so high end, the pump should be better (I know Iu2019m not the only one who experienced this issue)... third, you must moisturize afterward. Iu2019m currently debating my moisturizer and I would try Tatau2019s since I like the company except I refuse to pay upwards of $100 for the tiny bottle (sorry, I know itu2019s high end, but thatu2019s bonkers). I will say, one bottle does last me 6 months which comes out to less than $15 a month which is decent.

It has small exfoliating granuals in it but still manages to be somewhat gentile. This is magic on my dried out winter skin, when my daily chemical exfoliating pads just aren't enough - though I would be weary to use this every day. Because of the sand like exfoliators I could see this irritating skin of used every day. And definitely do not use with your clarisonic or other cleansing devices. Hands only!   This is def worth a try."

But you serious do not need a lot! So not only does it feel amazing on your skin, but I have VERY sensitive skin and it does not irritate it whatsoever. I havenu2019t had a product I was this happy with in a while. There were dramatic results for me overnight! A little story about my sensitive skin for you - this past weekend my mom got a new laundry detergent and when she hugged me I could tell it was different. That very day my face started breaking out. I had about 20 teeny tiny zits on my cheeks. Made my cheeks extremely red. I got the kit on Monday, by the way, Monday morning I woke up and my face was so red it looked like I just put blush all over my cheeks. So that night I got home from work, washed my face, put the mast on, cleaned it off then used the moisturizer. Tuesday - Not only did I only have THREE zits but ALL the redness was gone. This has been like a miracle kit for my sensitive skin! It feels great, it doesnu2019t burn, and the mask doesnu2019t get so hard it hurts your face. I definitely recommend this to someone with highly sensitive skin. I donu2019t know if itu2019s supposed to help with breakouts too but it definitely worked for that too!"

The Tata cleanser really helps to get off all of the dirt and pollution from the day, and soften the skin to get it ready for other products.   Some people have complained about the pump/nozzle. I however, think it's right for this cleanser. You want to apply this dry, and you really don't need more than 3 or 4 pumps as it spreads well. Plus, at $78, do you really want it to pump out a huge gob where you don't even need that much?  Pro tip: use this layered under the resurfacing mask!"

I would consider purchasing the full size, however, for the simple reason that this cleanser has grains of stuff in it, it becomes a product that I would use no more than once or twice a week.   If TH decides to remove the grains, I'd be all over this product - it makes my skin soft, smooth and with that ethereal glow after cleansing. I would seriously replace one of my current cleansers with this instead. The scent is pleasant and I don't see any red flags in the ingredient list (besides a couple of potentially irritating oils--but my skin is not sensitive). No harsh surfactants, no foamy lather but still gets the job done. It's a great second step cleanser after using a balm to remove makeup. You also only need a tiny bit of product to clean the entire face. The foil sample lasted me 5 uses, and I was generous with the amount I applied.  Unfortunately, the grains are a deal breaker for me. I've moved away from physical exfoliation as it could damage or irritate skin, and I rely on chemical exfoliation instead. I would most likely end up using this like a treatment rather than a daily cleanser. And I already have a very good arsenal of masks and treatments, plus a good rotation of 2-3 cleansers, so this product, while effective for my skin, simply doesn't have a place in my routine."

Still have a lot of breakouts, big pores, and uneven skin tone. As much as I love Harper's all natural approach and how the products feel, I can't recommend since I haven't noticed any results. Save your money."

After a particularly bad breakout, I was trying some different cleansers and acne treatments but all they seemed to be doing was drying out my skin and causing more problems. I decided to completely switch to Tata Harper as a more natural solution. I used the Regenerating Cleanser in addition with the Clarifying Cleanser. It took a couple of weeks for my skin to rebalance and heal, but it really worked. Now my skin is clear and soft and i don't have that tight, dry feeling after i wash my face which is typical  with acne medicated cleansers. It's expensive but well worth the price, in my opinion."

            "review_text": "One of the most critical steps to maintain a good, healthy looking, moisturized, young looking skin is to have a good cleansing/exfoliating system in place. Cell turn over slows down as we age, and the single way to speed this process up is the usage of AHA, BHA, enzymes and retinoids. All these guys remove layers of dead cells sitting on top of our skin (we have over 30 layers of dead cells!), so newer Cells can show up sooner. An effective cleanser will allow the serums and mosturizers to really penetrate into the skin, plumping and repairing it. Unfortunatelly most exfoliators damage and dry up your skin, so you have to be dilligent and do your research when picking up a good exfoliator. Avoiding plastic bids is crucial here.  So...you need to find products that are effective but also  kind on your skin.  Now, you want a gentle daily exfoliator, and also a stronger weekly mechanical exfoliator, to maintain a good system.  Having said all that, I firmly believe that this is, in my opinion, one of the best products in the market to maintain a radiant, younger looking skin. This product is absolutely outstanding. Gentle yet effectively will remove a good amount of debris every morning, guaranteeing that the rest of your skincare penetrates deeply into your Skin. Wont make your skin feel dry, tense or uncomfortable. The cocktail of ingredients is just perfect. Apricot seeds, pink clay, willow bark and others are just the right combo to do the job. The use of this product will shrink your pores and make your skin glow and feel comfortable, even if you are using retinoids. I typically use it over dry skin , every morning, and follow up with my Tatcha plumping Essence. The result? Gorgeous soft skin that keep getting compliments.  As a collateral... I have cut in half the amount of foundation I need.  Fantastic product. Im so glad that they listened and change the package. The squeezy tube is just perfect to deliver this product.  A must."

I wasn't sure at first how much of this I should use at a time but now I use three to four pumps of this only in the mornings. I use this to give my face a good 'scrub' on dry skin, then I wet my hands and continue to rub until the formula starts to dissolve. Then I rinse. This product rinses much 'cleaner' if you use it in this way and you may not need a second cleanse. I do however use a pump of Sunday Riley Ceramic Slip afterwards just because I'm oily/combination-skinned and I treat this as more of an exfoliant than a complete cleanser.  I ONLY use this in the mornings or before masks because this is not intended to be used on 'wet skin' and it is definitely NOT a makeup removing cleanser. I suggest removing your makeup beforehand and drying your face completely before you use this or you will be sorely disappointed  in this product!   Now that I use the right amount of product for my face, I've really come to love this stuff! It is soo exfoliating and has a lovely non-chemical scent. I find it to be very scruby even though the particles are super fine which I love. Great exfoliating cleanser for sure."

First of all, this is the first time I feel compelled to write a review For a product, it was that disappointing. First of all, the most frustrating thing about this cleanser was that it did not make my face feel clean, I always felt the need to wash my face with a foaming cleanser first and then use this just for the exfoliating properties. It did exfoliate but that isn't surprising since it has rough pieces in it, crushed apricot pits, or something like that. Next, the MOST annoying part of the incredibly expensive product (for what it is) the pump stops working after 3 or so times of use, and I had to get creative with getting the product out of the bottle, not easy when you are trying to wash your face, I like to pump and get on with my routine. Also, this is such a small amount, truly if you use the $40 bottle twice a day, you will run out of the product in about 3 weeks, I'm being generous.  I was so incredibly disappointed in this product especially since I went into this believing I was going to be blown away. I ended up keeping it only because by the time I gave this product enough time to give it a chance, 2 weeks, and one more week only using it once a day since it was running out, I had hardly any left. I didn't want to be that person that uses most of a product and then returning it. I would never buy this again and I would never recommend this. I did love the smell however, I suppose that's something? However I picked up the Ole Henricksen African Red Tea cleanser and it smells similar if not better. I also use Bobbi Browns Oil cleanser before the OH and use and enzyme peel daily to exfoliate and my skin looks and feels amazing.  I didn't even finish this bottle, I will give it to a friend to test."

Unfortunately, it doesn't have enough power to take off my makeup and/or sunscreen in the evening.

I used it for about 2.5 weeks and used only 3 pumps day and night. I never really got the same result as that first time AND TO MAKE THINGS WORST, THE PUMP STOMPED WORKING. I couldn't believe it, only had it for 2.5 weeks and the pump wasn't working and half the product was already gone. This is a pricey cleanser and you need to use a lot of product to get a good result. I would have thought that for such a high price and glass bottle, they would have a better pump."

I have recently ditched all toxic products (there were SO many!), and I am replacing all products with 100% natural and nontoxic products. I don't know why this took me so long to finally do, but I am so glad I did. Tata Harper is more pricey than other brands, but it is 100% worth it.  I wake up, put one pump (that's all you need for your whole face) on my dry face, and rub it around in small circles. I then rinse it off with lukewarm water. I apply my face serum (Previse), followed by my coffee bean eye cream (100% Pure), then finish with a face lotion (Kahina Giving Beauty), and my EOS lib balm. I get a TON of compliments on my skin.  If you're ready to commit to a natural, non-toxic product, this is the best one to buy. If you're only going to buy one, buy this one.I'm 32, olive skin, and combating the first signs of aging. I couldn't be happier with this product. Sephora, please bring more non-toxic options to your customers!!!"

Then I follow with floral essence spray, then anti-aging serum, eye cream and replenishing nutrient oil complex. I have always had red skin like rosacea and flaking skin in t-zone along with acne scaring, oily glands but dry in t-zone. I am very impressed that these products, even though they smell delicious and somewhat strong, did NOT cause any reactions or redness/tingling/burning.

This one little change has made a HUGE difference in my skin. This cleanser exfoliates so gently, without compromising your skin's balance, that your skin just gets clear and soft and the results aren't temporary--I'm done with my first bottle and I can't imagine my routine without it.

It leaves my skin so incredibly soft and clean after use, and it cleared up some pesky blackheads on my t-zone and chin quickly. I am not getting as oily during the day and my skin looks matte yet glowing throughout the day. I also adore the way this product feels during use and how it smells.  One thing I did notice using it on a dry face is that after awhile it sticks on your skin and doesn't seem to do much. Don't get more product, just wet your fingertips and continue cleansing your face. It relathers nicely. :-)"

I dont like toner, it dries my face out, so I dont feel like I should have to use it to be rid of all my makeup. Strike one.  I followed the directions to use dry on the face. I had to use a lot to get any kind of coverage. Trying a thin layer this stuff would melt into my skin, leaving it dry in seconds. The amount I had to use was huge, and it made a big dent in my bottle right off the bat. I could see that this product wouldn't last very long at all. Strike two.  This product goes back tomorrow.

That said, I haven't returned it and am allowing a bit more time to see how the new system (once a day) works. Also, I just have to say that Tata Harper has the worse packaging ever. One bottle was smashed to bits. The eye cream, which i love, had a top that was not fully severed from the bottom. I had to use tools to get it open. This never happens and I buy a lot of stuff!

Instead of rinsing it all at once I wet my hands a little and bring them to my face to continue to massage and make the most out of the product. Once I am satisfied I rinse everything to make sure there is no residue left behind. Yes, this is expensive, but you really don't need to use a lot and I feel that it will last for AGES.  The gentle exfoliating effect helps to keep my skin smooth and to get rid of any flakes that I might have. I use prescription strength retinol on my face 3 times a week, BHA exfoliator twice a day and other BHA's and this is still gentle enough for me.  I am not to crazy on the smell of it.

I use it either as my second cleanse in the evening or as my morning cleanse and it is fantastic. Not irritating, not drying, not in any way offensive to my skin (which can be quite sensitive). I would not use this as my first cleanse in the evening (makeup/sunscreen removal) as I only use cleansing balms/oils for that but as a second cleanse it is fantastic.

When I called Sephora they offered to send out a brand new replacement at no charge! What a lovely surprise to be greeted with such outstanding service. TATA Harper now has the premium spot on my sink. After a couple of weeks of regular use I am thrilled with my skin. Winters in Iowa are harsh but this cleanser has smoothed out and brightened my face and makes even the coldest snow and wind storms a distant memory each night. The light smell is intoxicating as well. Nicely done. I would recommend this to women and men as my husband tried it too...but he has to get his own bottle because this is mine mine mine!"

For me at least, I like the business model of this line. That alone isn't enough to make me LOVE a product, but in this case, it added a few bonus points in understanding the brand.  This product is to be started on dry skin. This bothered me a little at first, but I did as instructed. It is creamy enough to use on dry skin - so I use it right before I jump in the shower.  It is very rich with the perfect size and amount of microbeads (aka 'very small grit'.) It is gentle. It leaves my skin looking and feeling wonderfully smooth, resurfaced and polished.  I liked the way my skin looked immediately. After two weeks, I actually had co-workers commenting that my skin looked 'brighter' and they asked if I was 'doing something different.  My skin does look smoother, brighter and more even.  I have terrible combination skin, so 3-4 times I week, after I use this, I do a 'double cleanse' with my anti-acne cleanser. This is NOT because this product doesn't clean enough - but I am prone to cystic acne and I am unwilling to give up my acne prevention steps.  This wonderful cleanser does not over-dry my dry areas. In fact, I develop dry patches quickly and this cleanser eliminated one pesky patch completely in just a few days.  It is nicely scented and although it may sound weird, it doesn't make me sneeze (Sadly this can be a problem with me so I am always relieved when a scented product I like doesn't make me sneeze!)  Overall - it is a wonderful cleanser and exfoliator. After 30 days of use, I am convinced this is a winner and will remain part of my regular skincare regime."

I give it four stars because it is SO expensive and I wish they would package it differently. As the cleanser is so thin, it drips out quickly when you are trying to close it with the twisting cap."

The scent is a pleasant energizing citrus and it isn't too harsh for my picky somewhat sensitive skin, but with that said I cannot use this daily, I have to use it every third day and can never get through the bottle before it expires (6 months), and since this is a natural product I stick to the date pretty strictly. I love it, just wish they made a smaller bottle for infrequent exfoliators!"

Good hydration while cleansing & exfoliating the face & neck every morning! I usually leave it on 10 to 15 minutes for a quick mask. Smell wonderful too!"
