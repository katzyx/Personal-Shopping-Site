			"review_text": "As a beauty professional with over 25 years of experience, I’ve tried countless cleansers. The Tata Harper Regenerating Cleanser stands out as a luxurious option. This 100% natural, non-toxic product is ideal for anyone looking for gentle exfoliation and deep cleansing in one easy step. Its creamy formula infused with apricot microspheres and BHAs is made from white willow bark. It helps provide a polished, radiant finish without being overly rough. Although I t’s an effective solution for all skin types, I especially love it for those of us with dull, uneven texture and pore congestion.  What I love most about this cleanser is its ability to refine and brighten the skin while maintaining its natural moisture barrier. The soft citrus and floral scent make every use feel like a spa experience. It also offers a blend of pomegranate enzymes and aloe vera which renew the skin gently while soothing any redness or irritation. For my clients with sensitive skin, I recommend using it 2-3 times a week as an exfoliant rather than a daily cleanser to avoid over exfoliation or dryness.   If you’re on a clean beauty journey or simply seeking high performance skincare, this is a great option. It works great as the first step in a morning or evening routine, it leaves the skin soft, smooth, and prepped for serums and moisturizers. If you’re serious about maintaining a radiant complexion and love products that combine efficacy with eco-luxury, the Tata Harper Regenerating Cleanser is worth the investment."

			"review_text": "I really have enjoyed trying this cleanser for the first time and continuing to use it. The texture was a welcomed suprise with very small grits in the gel to help gently exfoliate the skin. The cleanser was gentle but still helped to exfoliate the dead skin cells. I did not find it overly striping at all for my dry, sensitive skin. I like that this formula also has BHAs in the formula to help with a chemical exfoliation while simultaneously exfoliating with the physical apricot partials. The packaging of course is also very nice. The glass bottle is sleek and elegant and gives luxury. I would only use this scrub every other day at the most for my dry skin however I did love the effect it gave when using it with the waterlock moisturizer. Overall a great scrub"

It’s not harsh which was my first impression when I put it into my fingers. It’s really gently yet effective in removing impurities or left over make up. I feel it opens up and cleans deeply my pores without stripping my skin like other exfoliators do. It’s not only effective but also it smells unbelievable amazing! The bottle is a strong heavy glass with a nice pump. It’s a really luxurious look and feeling. After trying I’ve been incorporating into my routine for many days now and my skin hasn’t become dry. I totally recommended it. Not sure if someone with sensitive skin will react same way but my skin took it amazing."

From the beautiful green glass bottle to the natural citrusy scent, every detail of this cleanser screams luxury. The dual-action formula combines physical exfoliants like apricot microspheres with chemical exfoliants (BHA) derived from white willow bark. It leaves my skin feeling baby-soft without being too abrasive or causing irritation. Perfect for daily use, even on my somewhat sensitive skin. It’s not just a cleanser—it also brightens and smooths the skin. My complexion looks more clear and less red! The pics speak for themself!"

The regenerating cleanser is a game changer for my combination skin. The packaging is so beautiful, soft and I love its green and yellow colors. I started by applying and massaging gently on my dry skin, until it turned white. The cleaner is creamy and grainy. The exfoliant part is so gentle and left my skin so very soft. I did not need to massage my face for too long for the cleaner to turn white, and then I added water which melted the cleanser. My skin was left extremely soft and absolutely matte, no shine to be seen. There was a bit of tightness but nothing to be worried about. The scent of the cleanser was sweet. I loved my experience!"

The physical exfoliation is so nice right now, especially  in the winter when I have some flaking skin and need to prep my skin surface before applying makeup. The smell is so nice and clean and reminds me of a fancy spa treatment. This regenerating cleanser does its job to clean my face and exfoliate the surface but is not irritating at all which is shocking because every other physical exfoliating cleanser that I have tried has made my face burn or itch or turn red. I like to use an oil cleanser as my first step and then switch between this and the clarifying cleanser to give my skin a break from the exfoliation. Using this in conjunction with the Tata Harper face mask and the other facial cleanser has made my pores look so clean and my face feels so glowy in the mornings!"

I have dramatically less flakes on my cheeks, as you can see in my before and after closeup.   The application is unique in that you apply the exfoliating cleanser to a dry face - I felt like this really amped up the polishing effect/feeling and it was a simple 30 seconds added to my routine.  I have been doing a double-cleanse by following up with the Tata Harper Clarifying Cleanser.   This product smells great, works quickly, and has delivered the results I was looking for.  It rinses clean and leaves my skin feeling smooth and looking soft and touchable. I am also happy to report that the exfoliants did not irritate or exacerbate my broken capillaries. I would recommend this product to any of my dry skin friends without hesitation!"

It's exfoliating since it has apricot seed powder yet very gentle, my skin feels smooth and very clean, not stripped (thank you kaolin clay) after washing.  After the initial use, I didn't apply moisturizer after to see if the cleanser would dry out my skin and make it oily later, but to my surprise it didn't. My skin felt hydrated and not dry nor oily. I love that it doesn't contain any dyes or fragrance, and they use fruit extract & essential oils for this, love the scent which makes me feel relaxed & calm. My pores look cleaner after 2 weeks of usage. I think my skin tone is more even & brighter. My breakout is less inflamed, which is my main concern when I try any new product, thank goodness that this is not the case. Finally, I love the glass bottle, i'm a sucker for anything glass, I feel fancy & indulged while using this."

It feels like I gave my face an entire facial in just one quick wash, my skin felt refreshed and renewed. as always I love the fragrance of the cleanser it smells sweet and not overpowering, it smells floral but not like flowers it's so hard to explain but I love it! and I love everything about this product!"

In terms of the product, I love the exfoliating feeling as my skin feels super clean afterwards without feeling stripped. The cleanser has a scent to it that I feel like reminds me of a fancy spa or salon. I have noticed my skin to feel much cleaner afterwards as well as polished. After implementing this cleanser into my morning and nighttime skincare routines for the past two weeks, I've noticed my pores to be far less pronounced. Additionally, I've also noticed the acne on my face reduce drastically which is great knowing this product is truly cleaning my skin properly. I highly recommend this for those with dry and sensitive skin as I did not have any irritation."

I’ve tried every cleanser from high end to drugstore and nothing has come close to the results this gives me.   I’ve always struggled with rough and textured skin no matter how many scrubs, moisturizers, etc I try. After one use of this, my skin felt so buttery smooth and soft and my foundation applied like a dream instead of the usual patchy mess. After continued use, my skin is brighter, pores are smaller and I have no more flakey skin! Another benefit I’ve noticed is that with my dead skin gone, all my other skincare products are able to penetrate deeper and deliver better results. I think pictures are worth a thousand words and the difference is clear in my before and after pictures. If you struggle with flakey textured skin, this product, though pricy, is 100% worth the investment."

The formula itself left my skin feeling clean and buffed without stripped or dry. Even though I have oily to combo skin, I do live in a dry climate and with the colder months coming, I don't want something that dried my face out even more. The beads inside the formula are not irritating or harsh and don't scratch up my face. I like to even mix this with their other face wash to get the benefits of both. The scent is also light and smells great, but it is something to note if you don't like too much fragrance in your face products. I only use the scrub 2-3 times a week even though it says you can use it daily. I like that is also has a chemical exfoliate."

Because of the texture and moisturizing ingredients your skin feels soft and brighter, and not tight and stripped.   I like to use it in the morning as it helps my makeup look better, and brightens me up. I've been a makeup artist for 20 years, and exfoliating before makeup makes a HUGE difference.

But in true Tata Harper fashion, they proved me wrong again. For someone with sensitive and dry skin, I used to think that I couldn’t use scented products and exfoliating products because they would further dry out my skin, but after using this regenerating cleanser for a couple of days, I noticed that my skin wasn’t dry and dull as it typically is after washing my face which is shown in my before image. My face was typically ashy white EVERY single time I washed my face until I tried the regenerating cleanser. I loved how visibly, bright, and radiant my skin was. This was a game-changer for my skincare routine. I disliked having to rely on thick moisturized all the time to keep my face moisturized. I learned from using this entire line that my first defense to treat dull and dry skin is using a high-quality cleanser. I absolutely loved this product and how it transformed my skin in a matter of days. It lathers up well, and a little bit goes a long way. As a bonus, I am so glad the signature citrusy scent is still present, it’s the highlight of my morning routine."

You can feel the grittiness of this product but at the same time it is gentle on the skin! The product has a very pleasant earthy citrus scent to it. The best part is, once you rinse it off, your skin seriously feels so soft and smooth. It has made the texture of my skin look so much better and my skin feels rejuvenated after using this scrub.

I tend to have a lot of texture because of my oily skin but I’ve noticed that it is looking smoother. These colder months play tricks on me and dry out my skin so I feel like the thickness and hydrating properties have been helping to balance out whatever Mother Nature is trying to do. The only thing I don’t love is that because it is thick it feels like I have to use more water and massage my face more in order to get the product off more, other than that I am liking the product.

Smell for me is important because anything that is too strong, I get turned off by it.  However this cleanser doesn’t have too much of a strong smell, and I can handle it easily  I recommend this product to anyone that wants a beautiful and glowing skin and feel great about themselves."

			"review_text": "I’ve been using the Tata Harper Regenerating Cleanser for two weeks now, applying it 2–3 times a week, and it’s quickly become a staple in my skincare routine. Its semi-thick, creamy texture with fine exfoliating beads feels gentle yet effective, and the fresh, tropical scent is so refreshing; it feels like a little spa moment at home.  On days I plan to dermaplane my face, I spend extra time working it into my skin because it does an amazing job at removing dead skin. This step makes my skin incredibly soft and ensures a closer shave. Even with this added exfoliation, it doesn’t leave my combination skin feeling dry or irritated. The exfoliation beads are small enough that it doesn't irritate or rub my skin hard.   After just a few uses, I’ve noticed my skin feels smoother and a little more even-toned. It doesn’t make my face feel greasy or look oily. I apply it to my dry skin first and rub it in until it emulsifies to a white color and lighter consistency before washing off with warm water."

I really enjoyed that the cleanser had to be applied on dry skin. That was new and different. I really felt the particles working to exfoliate my skin. It did not take long for the cleanser to turn white while massaging it on my skin. Even though I’m in my twenties, I worry about aging from tugging on my skin unnecessarily. Oh the scent, it smells tropical almost like papaya, pineapples and fruits like that. My skin felt so smooth once I rinsed it off. It is exactly what I needed during this dry winter weather. My skin needed the exfoliation and moisturization. My skin did not feel dry at all. It had a glow, felt smooth and plump.  This review was collected as part of a promotion."

Because of the weather, my skin became very very dry and felt like a sandpaper. Even with the routine I had from before cannot save it. I used it as a day and night cleanser during the first week but noticed that the best way for me to use this is only one time and at night. So this is now my staple night time cleanser. I love that the beads are not harsh on the skin and that the smell of this is my favorite among all the cleansers I have tried from the brand. You can visibly see the brightness that it gives. This cleanser is not harsh on the skin even if ai use it as a quick daily facial by leaving it on for 5 minutes before rinsing. If you have sensitive skin like me, do not hesitate to try this cleanser specially if you have acne prone skin as it might be the solution you have been looking for. Love this brand and its ideals. Tata Harper has been a match for me!"

I usually try to stay away from exfoliators as I feel like they just make my skin worse. This exfoliator has both physical and chemical exfoliators. Im not going to lie, I was concerned with the apricot microspheres, but to my surprise, they were extremely small and not jagged like I assumed. When I put it on my bare dry face, I felt the microspheres at work, but it did not hurt at all. I also noticed a scent that I actually liked but did not linger on the skin. The BHA chemical exofliation comes from white willow bark and after a couple of days, I could see the difference. My face looked brighter, felt softer and best of all did not break out from it. Though this is a gentle exfoliator, I now do not use it every day as my medication is pretty strong, but that is my unique circumstance. For normal everyday people, I would say it is okay to use every day for a gentle exfoliation. However, since everyone is different, I would just recommend using however many times a week you see fit for you."

Every time I use it, I feel like I’m enveloped in the most refreshing burst of citrus, which always leaves me craving oranges afterward. The fragrance alone makes this cleanser a sensory delight.  What makes this cleanser truly unique is how versatile and effective it is. I love that I can use it directly on dry skin. I pour a small amount onto my hands, massage it onto my face, and then gradually add just a little water. The process feels luxurious. As I wet my hands and continue massaging, the formula gently emulsifies, making it easy to rinse off completely. It’s a small ritual that feels both effective and indulgent.  One of the standout features for me is how smooth and soft my skin feels after each use. Despite being an exfoliating cleanser, it never strips or irritates my skin. The microbeads give it a traditional exfoliating feel, similar to a sugar scrub, but the texture is refined and gentle. It’s powerful enough to polish away dead skin but delicate enough for daily use. I’ve found that with gentle massaging, it works beautifully without needing to apply much pressure.  This cleanser hits all the right notes for me—it’s a fantastic daily exfoliator, it leaves my skin glowing and smooth, and the scent is pure heaven. It’s easily a 5 out of 5 in my book, especially for exfoliating cleansers. If you’re looking for a product that feels both effective and luxurious, I can’t recommend this one enough."

It does smooth out the skin to leave behind a radiant glow and isn’t stripping at all. The highlighted ingredients that I like in all Tata Harper botanical formulations is definitely what I appreciate about this cleanser.

Tata Harper uses natural ingredients with a focus on being gentle to even the most sensitive skin. I tried the Regenerating Cleanser - perfect since I am out of my exfoliating products! This cleanser is a cream based cleanser - I didn’t notice a scent with it and it does have physical exfoliant. The beads are very very small and reminded me of pumice but they are actually made of apricot seed powder. I would give this 5 stars but I found the grit hard to remove at the sink. There are also AHAs in this cleanser for chemical exfoliation and brightening. I noticed my skin did appear much lighter and brighter after using this! I think this would be great for any skin type since it is so gentle but particularly for someone with dry or aging skin since it's creamy and moisturizing. I will keep this one in the shower so I don’t over do it with exfoliation and so the grit rinses off easier!"

I have very ruddy skin and normally after I use a face wash or exfoliant my skin will be red for a few minutes after until it settles- not with this wash. Super smooth skin with no red flush after. Gentle and effective. I love this wash and will probably end up using it every other day if not daily. Not to mention the scent is this light apricot and fresh greens blend that is delightful.

I wish my before picture was right before starting use instead of a few days ahead, because I broke out like crazy -- BIG zits on both cheeks, my forehead, above my lips -- and this cleanser cleared me up almost entirely in a week in combination with the clarifying cleanser. The bottle design evokes timeless class. I have no other product in my master bath, despite having other luxury brands, which is as aesthetically pleasing as the Tata Harper packaging. I like that the design is such that you can instantly see how much product is left with the see-through glass bottle.

I can see how this would be a good fit for many skin types. It's great to clear clogged pores or schluff off dry skin. It's a really nice gel cleanser consistency that easily suds up. It does have a rather strong medicinal/eucalyptus/menthol type of scent that does linger on the skin. I don't mind it but others might.

As a skincare professional, cleansers are a non-negotiable in your skincare routine and a good one is hard to find. This cleanser is different in a sense where you would use it on dry skin so you can get the best results. It is a combination of physical exfoliation and chemical exfoliation so it polishes and refines the texture of your skin without being too abrasive or harsh. The Regenerating Cleanser has amazing ingredients to help rejuvenate the skin and to draw out impurities. I tend to have oily/ combination skin on the more sensitive side and being able to use this as a daily exfoliant has really changed my outlook on exfoliating everyday as I found it to be too harsh for my skin. The packaging itself is luxurious and the price point is also something to note if you're in the mood to treat yourself for a gift. Overall, I am very pleased with this cleanser as it leaves my skin looking radiant and healthy! Please ignore the red spot on my lower lip area that is a mosquito bite!"

First off, the texture is really unique—it's creamy but with these super fine exfoliating particles that feel like you're getting a gentle scrub without being too harsh. I love that it’s packed with natural ingredients, so I feel good about what I’m putting on my skin.   After using it, my face feels incredibly soft and smooth, and there’s this instant glow. It’s like I’ve just come back from a facial, no joke. The scent is really fresh and spa-like, which makes washing my face feel a little more luxurious, you know? I also love that it’s a 2-in-1 cleanser and exfoliator, so it saves me time in my routine.   The best part? I’ve noticed my pores looking smaller and my skin just looks overall more even and radiant. I’ve been using it every morning, and it’s gentle enough for daily use.

Like all of Tata Harper’s products, the regenerating cleanser smells divine with notes of herbal to calm the senses. My skin feels instantly invigorated and squeaky clean after use.

It was so fresh scent. I felt like I was enjoying at luxury spa.  This cleanser is for daily exfoliator because it has very light level of exfoliating. However I only use 2-3 times as it has BHA will get my skin dry. When I gently scrubbed and massage on face, my skin had no any reaction, no irritation. The exfoliator polished and buffed with BHA and apricot microspheres to remove my dead skin and blackhead. My skin felt smoother and tightener. The pores looked like tightener.  Be attention on color of cleanser, for best used you take a small amount onto face and neck and gently scrub until cream turns white, then rinse with warm water.

The texture? It’s like rubbing crushed-up angel wings on your face—gentle yet somehow powerful enough to make my skin feel like it just hit the reset button.  And those tiny exfoliating beads? They’re like little scrubbing minions, working tirelessly to banish all the gunk and dead skin cells I didn’t even know were hanging out on my face. After rinsing, my skin feels so smooth, I’m half convinced it might just slide right off.  But the real kicker? My face is now so glow-y that my mirror almost asked for sunglasses. I’m pretty sure my pores are singing hallelujahs, and my skin feels so soft, I’m considering offering free cheek pets to strangers.  So, if you’re looking to treat your face to a little slice of heaven while also giving it a serious glow-up, this Tata Harper cleanser is your new best friend. Just don’t blame me if you start getting extra compliments—or if your mirror starts wearing shades."

For reference, I have combination skin that is acne-prone. I have been using this cleanser daily in the morning for about two weeks now. When I use it, I usually apply it to my dry skin and let it sit for a minute or two before rubbing it in and rinsing it off. Overall, I've been really impressed with this cleanser! Since I started using it regularly, I've definitely noticed a reduction in clogged pores, and I think it has also helped to even out my skin's appearance. The cleanser looks luxurious and smells clean and fresh. It contains tiny natural exfoliants and I love how it feels on my skin. Since I have combination skin that leans dry, I often struggle with exfoliating cleansers, because they strip my skin and leave it overly dry. However, I have not had that issue at all with this cleanser and instead found that it leaves my skin feeling balanced and clean. It's also a major plus that the cleanser is vegan and cruelty-free. Overall, I would very highly recommend this cleanser!"

It provides gentle physical and chemical exfoliation with BHA. I found that the exfoliating apricot microspheres are not abrasive at all compared to St. Ives so it’s gentle enough to use twice daily. However, your skin may be more photosensitive so applying SPF is a must. The way I use this is by applying it to dry skin and gently massaging my face for at least twenty seconds. The cleanser turns white to let you know that it’s time to rinse. After, my skin feels so much more smoother and my pores are noticeably smaller. I experience hormonal breakouts, but using this helps immensely with combating the blemishes before they form. This cleanser was formulated with 100% natural ingredients such as pomegranate enzymes and pink grapefruit, which is why it smells citrusy and botanical. I love it!"

This cleanser has helped my acne tremendously. I have had acne for as long as I can remember, and the older I get it’s harder to get rid of or to keep it at bay . This is such a great formula and it also helps me feel confident that I’m getting all the dirt and oils off my face . I have even removed my makeup with it . One little pump goes a long way and. This feels like a spa facial at home and like I stated before the scent alone will wake you up and make you feel like you have a fresh and clean face also if your suffering from acne this is going to help .

However, I was pleasantly surprised that it was not abrasive and quite gentle on my skin. It comes in a luxurious pump bottle which makes it convenient to use. I have been using 1 squirt twice a week at night and have been enjoying it. The texture is very interesting, you put it on dry face and massage it and then add water and it turns white leaving your face clean and not stripped. It is not very heavily scented but it does have added fragrance in it so if you are sensitive to fragrance, this will not be for you.

I have heard of Tata Harper, but have not yet used anything from them until now.  I love that this cleanser is a vegan and cruelty free product. There is little to no scent with this cleanser and the scent I do smell is spa like and very luxirous. The texture was not what I was expecting, in a good way. It is super creamy with nice physical exfoliant in it and is very spreadable. 1 accidentally used way too much my first time applying, so it is nice to know a little goes a long way with this. I mistakenly applied this to wet skin rather than dry but did still get the product to turn white. Following this I used the product as intended and still did not need a lot of it to get the product worked into my neck and face.  As someone with dry skin, I am often hesitant to use exfoliants due to it being too harsh on my skin. With this Tata Harper cleanser, my first use I did notice my skin felt a bit stripped of moisture and almost burning. However, I adjusted my usage to every couple of days and with a moisturizer after this made my skin feel really nice. I look forward to continuing using this when my skin needs a little extra exfoliation."

Tata Harpers Regenerating Cleanser is my first experience with the brand. With the higher price tag that this product carries, I was excited to try it out and truly put a luxury brand to the test. Upon first impression I was very pleased with the packaging. Both the box and the bottle were very sturdy and a lot nicer than your typical packaging. I was also very pleased with the scent of the product, it has a pleasant apricot like smell which is perfect for the summer season. I have dry, red, and flakey skin as you can see in my before and after pictures. This product has definitely helped with the texture of my skin and so far has been gentle enough to use daily. Overall I would give this a sold 4 out of 5 stars. The price point is my only issue. Otherwise I would recommend for a skincare newbie or skincare fanatic!"

Although this cleanser does contain a physical exfoliant, it is very finely milled and housed in a creamy and nourishing cleanser. Together these have made my skin look much more bright and clearer than before I began using it. My two cautions with this product would be that it does have a slightly prohibitive price point, which makes it different to maintain in a daily routine. The other is that it had a slightly botanical/ foral scent that could be a bit much for those sensitive to fragrances or scents"

I was pleasantly surprised to find this was a gentle, foaming cleanser! I loved how clean my face felt after using, and the exfoliation was not too rough or abrasive.   I have sensitive skin and eyes, but it did not irritate me at all. I have rough and dry skin and it’s been left feeling so soft after the first use, which says a lot. I definitely feel a noticeable difference since introducing the cleanser.   I will say my only qualm is that this product is not a good makeup remover (it’s not marketed this way either), so I have to double cleanse if I’m wearing makeup. However, I’ve just been using it as a morning cleanser to solve this issue."

First, the bottle packaging looked so luxurious, and it was made by a vegan cruelty brand. It has been my skincare staple, the cleanser. As I have sensitive skin, I did not breakout. It has a citrusy smell, but it is manageable. Actually, I really love it. The microbeads help to exfoliate my skin, remove some of my dead skin, and actually lessen my black heads. I feel my skin slightly dry after, but it is so manageable. It is so amazing that I noticed the changes in my skin after how many times I've used the clenser. Also, I feel my skin is more hydrated and glowy. My skincare routine is lacking without this regenerating cleanser."

I love to switch up my routine with different formulas because my dry skin has so many different issues of dryness going on. I like to use an exfoliant in the AM and am loving this regenerating cleanser. I think it's the fragrance that makes me the most excited(obviously second to the skin care benefits lol) this has a huge burst of citrus-y Pink Grapefruit and definitely smell the Bergamot(which I love)and it seems to boost my morning mood a bunch. I can really tell the difference between this and other facial exfoliating cleansers. I noticed how plump and moisturized my skin felt after the first use. My skin felt so much smoother and it flaked away my rough patchy dry spots.  After a week of daily use I saw subtle changes in my skin.  -I didn't have to use as much moisturizer. -My fine lines and pores looked less noticable. -My skin looked waay more hydrated.  -Holy Smokes the softness!!! -My makeup laid so much smoother on my face. -My skin did not feel stripped(most importantly) or abused.  I think the ingredients deliver exactly what they claim. A soft delicate exfoliation from the Pomegranate Enzymes, White Willow Bark and Apricot microspheres. I do think though this will be my summer only cleanser because my winter skin NEEEDS this kind of exfoliant.  I recommend this cleanser especially if you love a crisp, creamy citrus scent. I know it sounds silly, but a beautiful bonus is when it comes to skin care is how pretty the look on your bathroom vanity LOL! The attention to detail and the gorgeous green brings an accented level of FANCY It's eye catching!"

During my home renovation projects my skin's texture has declined drastically and I've tried multiple products to help combat this issue and while some will work initially, they tend to stop working. Then I'm stuck scrubbing my face with a cloth to have my skin feel smooth again (do not do this!). Tata Harper's Regenerating Cleanser emerged as my saving grace. Infused with BHAs from white willow to exfoliate and coral clay to unclog pores, this cleanser tackled the grime which accumulated from the messiness of renovations. My skin feels smooth and the cleanser adds much needed hydration and pore cleansing at the same time.  There is a grapefruit scent which smells absolutely delicious, transforming my skincare routine into a spa-like experience even though my current life is chaotic and messy, much needed self care. The scent is really grounding as well and calms my nerves. The green glass bottle not only exudes luxury but also adds an eco conscious aspect as glass is much more recyclable and better for the environment than plastics, this is a huge bonus for me. Additionally, which sets this cleanser apart is its commitment to natural ingredients, 100% from natural origins and with over 80% sourced from organic farms. Knowing that it's Cosmo organic certified by Ecocert Greenlife provides assurance of its authenticity and its significance in clean beauty. I appreciate when brands make significant efforts to be better for us, and our planet.

The exfoliating properties of the cleanser help buff away any dead skin on your face, but are not harsh at all. You are left with a much brighter and even looking skin tone after just the initial usage. Likewise, it does not strip the skin or leave it feeling dry. The ingredients are very clean & of the highest quality, meaning you’re truly helping your skin with the best the market has to offer. The cleanser is great for everyday usage, in my opinion. It helped minimize the clogged pores on my skin & overall just exfoliate any impurities. Overall, I truly enjoyed the Tata Harper Regenerating Cleanser and would recommend it to anyone looking for a great exfoliating cleanser!"

			"review_text": "As a middle-aged woman who, like so many others, is busy taking care of my family, working, and putting out fires everywhere, Tata Harper’s Regenerating Cleanser is my easy new go-to for gentle daily exfoliation. As a skincare enthusiast, I love that it’s crafted from all-natural ingredients like apricot microspheres and BHA sourced from white willow bark. With every wash, it gently sloughs off dead skin cells, giving me a noticeably smoother, more radiant complexion. What truly sets it apart is that is actually does what it claims to do- dissolving buildup, refining pores, and infusing hydration- it wakes up my skin making it look plumper, cleaner, and more refined. As someone fighting the clock, I look for products that restore my skin- if a product can make my skin look younger then I’m all over it, and this cleanser delivers on that. Its gentle nature makes it perfect for daily use, leaving me with a fresh, glowing complexion. It’s so quick and simple- I just massage it onto dry skin it in the morning for 15-20 seconds, just one pump is enough, and I’m done- it’s perfect for those busy days when I want to put my best face forward. I recommend this for anyone who appreciates natural ingredients and wants a gentle daily exfoliator that leaves your skin feeling fresh, radiant, and hydrated."

Before using this exfoliating cleanser, I had been struggling with some dry patches on my skin, perhaps due to aging, and while other exfoliators would help slightly, I’d seem to have the same problem again in a few days. With this cleanser however, my skin is the smoothest it’s been in years. Moisturizers that had been sitting on top of my skin or pilling are now soaking right into my skin, and I’m loving the gorgeous glow it’s given me!  This is a very effective exfoliating cleanser that’s gentle enough for every day use, which is great because I feel like I’m in a spa every time I use it."

Usually, with ingredients like BHA, my skin gets angry and irritated. However, while using this cleanser, it did not! I'm able to polish away any dead skin and be left with a beautiful radiant glow. While using Tata's Regenerating Cleanser these past two weeks, I've noticed a major decrease in congested skin. My t zone is nearly clear of clogged pores, which makes me SO happy as this is something that I've struggled with for years! The creamy texture and small granules make for a truly gentle yet effective regenerating treatment. A little truly goes a long way when using this cleanser. I just apply a small amount onto my clean hands and massage into my skin in a circular motion. Once I feel I've done a complete scrub, I rinse with warm water. (By the way it rinses off easily unlike some regenerating cleansers where you can still feel the granules even after a good rinse.) Afterwards I'm left with beautiful soft, hydrated and glowing skin that feels renewed and refreshed and most importantly not burning or irritated!"

I’ve worked in the cosmetics and skincare industry for twenty years now and have seen it develop and change so much. This cleanser I wouldn’t really classify as a cleanser. It’s really an exfoliant.

I can easily see people over using it twice a day and over exfoliating their skin and damaging the moisture barrier with this product.

This product is definitely a 2 in 1 product that works as both a cleanser and an exfoliator. And honestly I am blown away by the results. In just a short week of using this cleanser, I can feel and see a difference in my skin. My skin feels healthy and looks fresh.  This cleanser is light brownish and orangish in color and has a very fresh, citrusy scent that I found to be very soothing. I use this cleanser in the night time. It is very easy to use. I use two pumps of this cleanser and gently start massaging this on my face. The cleanser has a very creamy yet grainy texture and starts turning white after massaging on the face. After massaging on my face for about 30 seconds, I add a few drops of water and keep further massaging on my face. After 30 more seconds I rinse it off with warm water.  I really like how my skin feels after using this cleanser. My skin feels extremely clean, soft and smooth after using this cleanser. This cleanser not only helps to remove all the dead skin cells but also refreshes and brightens my skin. It is gentle enough to use every single day revealing glowy shiny skin.

			"review_text": "I love love love this cleanser/exfoliator. I used it years ago, then couldn't find it anywhere, and am overjoyed to see it back. I was using other products in the interim but nothing I found did the trick. I have really sensitive skin, as well as dry and flaky, often red patches. This is gentle enough I can use it daily, but I typically use it every other day. It gets rid of dead skin, but is so gentle. It doesn't make my face red, sting, feel too tight, or dry afterwards. I don't use it dry however - I dampen my face a little first. This leaves my skin feeling rejuvenated and refreshed, smooth, moisture enough that I won't flake, and my skin actually appears dewy now. My husband has been using it too, and he's seen a big improvement in his skin and blemishes which due to a hormone imbalance and medical condition - has been problomatic for years. This does the trick and keeps blackheads from forming."

			"review_text": "More of a scrub than a cleanser, this is one I wouldn't dream of using twice daily - it's just far too much exfoliation for me. In here you have both a manual exfoliator (Apricot seed powder) and a chemical exfoliant (Willowbark - high in BHA). The cleanser comes in a elegant green glass bottle and is a citrus-y smelling lotion cleanser. The Apricot seeds in it, despite how it might appear in the pictures, are very finely milled, we're definitely not talking St Ives here! I apply just over 1 pump of it onto my dampened face, massage it in and then rinse off. Admittedly all that exfoliation does help clear my pores, but if I do it every day I end up with some slightly red patches for a few minutes, so twice weekly seems to work out best for me. Now the good news is that because it's a partly oil-based cleanser, the formula isn't drying, despite its potent combination of exfoliants. But on the other hand it also does not foam and isn't the easiest of cleansers to rinse off, being oil-based. Every time I use it I feel as though some residue is left behind on my skin and requires either a second cleanse with something else, or otherwise a toner and cotton pad. What you end up with is a cleanser that's more geared to non-sensitive, drier skin types that require the extra hydration. Love the ingredients, as I do with every TH product I've tried, but not sure if this is one that I'd be rushing out to re-purchase once it's finished.   ~ My Sephora Top 7 must-have list ~  (My top 7 must-have beauty products of all time, focusing mainly on my purchases at Sephora)  1.

I was not disappointed in any way and this is now my absolute favorite cleanser that I use both day-and-night. You start off applying it on dry skin and massage to exfoliate. The beads are very fine and gentle. Then you add water and continue cleansing and rinse.  My skin was clean without being stripped and it instantly felt soft and smooth.  It was also soothing and provided moisturization.  No tightness or irritation occurred.  The bottle itself has a luxe look and is made of glass.  I appreciate that because glass is much more eco-friendly.  I also really like that it comes in a pump and all ingredients are natural.  As a reference, I have oily, blemish prone skin.  I definitely recommend  to all."

The texture is creamy (it reminded me of a clay cleanser) with apricot microspheres and BHA from white willow bark to help remove the dead skin cells, unclog the pores, and leave the skin glowing, smooth and healthy. The tiny apricot particles didn't feel harsh on my skin, and the fragrance is very light, citrusy. I think it provides a luxurious experience. Although it is recommended to use a generous amount of this cleanser, I think you don't need a lot of it. This cleanser does a great job in removing the dead skin cells and making my skin look radiant and healthy. It doesn't leave my skin dry or feeling right. I prefer to use this cleanser 3x a week to avoid over-exfoliation.  The glass bottle adds a nice touch to the vanity and compared to other luxurious brands, the price of this cleanser is not so high."

The exfoliation is very fine and non-irritating but manages to get rid of any layer of skin that is going to make your makeup flake! It opens up your skin without stripping it. I use a retinol cream at night so this is an important step to not look dry and flaky during the day.  It also washes off without a struggle as some exfoliator products can be a pain to wash off outside the shower. It is very fragrant as Tata Harper products are. You don't need much, it goes a long way.  Having said all that, I'm not sure my skin could have tolerated it in my 20s."

But I did noticed that after rinsing and drying my face it felt a little bit tight, and a little stripped, so I wouldn't call this a hydrating cleanser. I actually like the bright, citrus scent and I'm usually not fan of products with a scent. It was too overpowering and smelled nice and fresh. I think that the exfoliation level wasn't too harsh, which is good since you're using this every day twice a day. But I think I would have preferred the product if it wasn't a physical exfoliant and a chemical exfoilant, which can be over-stripping. I probably would have liked it more if it was just a chemical exfoliant. But it did leave my skin feeling smooth, and looking nice and bright."

The formula has BHAs in it, so it didn't need a  physical exfoliant in it as well which can cause microtears in the skin if used too frequently. I love the cleanser, but will be using it on my hands and feet much more often than I will on my face, specifically because of the apricot microspheres in the formula. Will definitely be reaching for this when I feel like there's a lot of buildup on my skin, but definitely won't be using this daily."

When using, you want to carefully scrub your face otherwise you can irritate your skin. It is made for daily use if you desire, though I'll be using it 2/3x a week.

Well applying this product it made my skin feel like it was tightening a little bit. That made me feel that it was doing it’s work and getting down deep into the skin to revitalize the cells. The scent of it was a lot better than others that tend to be strong. I would recommend this product to anyone that wants their skin to feel clean and hydrated this is the product to use. The exfoliating of products makes it feel like it is getting down deep in the skin. And into the pores. This product was gifted by Tata Harper Skincare for my honest opinion and feedback."

The effect is expected to be very pleasant and active - in words  melts on contact with skin.   Does not give much foam (if they do not lie, there are no sulfates in the composition).  Rather, it emulsifies into a light lotion.  It does not cleanse, but rather refreshes the skin, protecting it from the effects of hard tap water.  There is absolutely nothing to clean this tool.

I like that it really works to scrub the dead skin and brighten my skin. It seems to visibly help with the lines between my eye brows. My skin felt a little itchy after scrubbing my face, so be sure to use a moisturizer to nourish your face. I only need to use 1 pump to fully scrub my face, so I think this will last me awhile."

I personally really enjoy the citrus scent that this has. The packaging is super luxurious and just really adds to a self-care routine! While this is a physical exfoliator, I find it to be relatively gentle and it leaves the skin feeling soft and not stripped.  NOTE: If you have sensitive skin, you should know that this cleanser does have some essential oils in it. If you know that your skin doesn't respond well to essential oils, this might not be one that you will like.  I normally try to avoid essential oils in my skincare because my skin doesn't normally respond well to them but I haven't had any issues with this cleanser.  I gave this cleanser 4 out of 5 stars because I think it would work for more people if it didn't have essential oils in it!"

This regenerating cleanser is a must-have for your skin care routine. It’s a game changer! I have dry skin and I use this cleanser every morning and night as first step of my skin care routine. I put two pumps into my palm and apply directly to bare skin, concentrating more on problem areas. The texture is creamy and soft to the touch. The scent is light and citrusy – I love it! The scrub component in this cleanser is apricot microspheres that are not harsh on your skin but effective. You don't need to scrub hard, just cleanse gently and it will get all the dead skin cells and debris off leaving your face very soft and supple. I have noticed a huge difference after only a few days of using this cleanser. My skin is clearer and the blotches of dry skin are gone. It feels perfectly smooth, healthy-looking, hydrated and soft as silk. I love that all Tata Harper Skincare products are vegan, free of harsh chemicals, and come in recyclable packaging. It went above and beyond my expectations. Highly recommend this product to anyone as it is great for any skin type."

At first I was concerned but after researching I saw that it was supposed to do that. That's what makes it work and leaves the skin silky smooth. To which it really does leave the skin REALLY smooth.

It’s definitely nothing like St. Ives or any other large, rough exfoliant; this is super gentle and great for everyday use.

The bottle is sleek and stylish, and it looks to be high quality. I was a bit taken back at the strong citrus scent. While it was fresh and bright, it almost reminded me of an orange cleaner. The dry application was something that I wasn't used to but didn't take away from the application. The product went on smooth and lathered pretty well. There was a light abrasiveness but not as much as you would find in a sugar or similar scrub. Overall after the first few days of application I am not overly impressed. For the higher price tag I was expecting my skin to feel better after use. My skin felt clean but slightly dry and coarse (which was suprising after reasing other reviews) It is not something I would probably purchase for myself but I will give it a few more days to see if it improves over time."

OMG this product is awesome. I do have oily/normal combination skin type. I use this product both day and night time on a daily basis. It does help control with my oily skin and monthly acne break. I don't have any acne breakout since I started this product. On a daily basis, I do 8-10 step Korean skin care product. I would recommend anyone with this product. The price is steep but it is worth the price tag IMO"

My skin is the worst possible combination type of dry, oliy, scarred, breakout-prone, and just everything at once - you name it. There are very, very few products that my skin will like and not break out from - and this exfoliating cleanser is one of them. I’ve used many exfoliating cleansers before (both 100% organic and not-so-natural ones) and they were all either not cleansing enough or too harsh on my skin. This regenerating cleanser hits a sweet spot right in the middle, exactly where it should be. It cleans my skin deeply enough to leave it very clean and refreshed but it does so without harsh abrasiveness (the size of the micro-beads isn’t large enough to be abrasive to the skin) . It leaves my skin neither dry nor oily, but balanced just right. I use it 2-4 times a week before bedtime, followed by a moisturizer or serum that I know won’t break me out. My skin looks a lot better and feels a lot softer and smoother right the next morning. I am now thinking of purchasing the company’s sampler set of their other products; particulary interested in their moisturizers and serums. I also love the fact their ingredients are natural because it puts my mind at ease knowing I’m not using dangerous / toxic chemicals on my skin. Maybe this is the major reason why the product works so well. Needless to say, I ditched all my other cleansers! But I just WISH the price tag wasn’t so high! :’’("

On top of that I was spending a ton of money and time trying out different projects and methods to try and improve it. So I went out on a whim and bought the whole Tata Harper line to replace my current regimen. I purchased the regenerating cleanser, floral essence, resurfacing serum, and hyaluronic acid moisturizer. After first use I could tell my skin looked plumper. I made sure to take my time to really work the serum and moisturizer into my skin. When I awoke next morning I saw a HUGE difference in redness, brightness, and acne scarring. I was so surprised. This stuff is awesome. Doesn’t smell bad. Seriously just buy it. I’m in love. Also be sure to read recommended use on the boxes, the facial wash is different you rub it into dry skin!"

On slightly wet skin I apply a very thin layer and emulsify and leave on for about 3 minutes before I wash off. My skin feels so smooth after that I get excited about using it. It makes the rest of your skincare work so much better. I love using first thing in the morning because the scent is so light and refreshing.

My skin feels amazingly smooth after daily use of cleanser and using the mask 2-3 times a week. I have noticed a major difference in my skin since starting using this regimen. Pores, greasiness and little hormonal breakouts or dietary breakouts on my chin or on my nose are my biggest concern. The breakouts go away quickly now. With consistent usage, I notice that my pores stay clearer longer which helps with the breakouts as well. I rarely need to use pore strips anymore and I would need to use them twice weekly to keep my pores clear previously. I can't say enough good things about this pricey product! After cleansing, I follow with a Vitamin C serum (Ole Henriksen or Tatcha), Caudalie Blemish Control Infusion serum (BHA), mineral fluid sunscreen and either Tatcha Water Cream or Kiehl's Cannabis Sativa Seed oil."

This works wonders and makes me skin look 10 years younger."

And it’s the only cleanser I’ve used that leaves my skin 100% clean after using a pad with toner (the pad comes out clean). With all my other cleansers, I have to use my Foreo Luna for the pad to come out clean. If I rinse my face without the Foreo Luna, the pad doesn’t come out clean. So for that reason, I’ll continue to rebuy this cleanser even though it’s very pricey. Every time I wear makeup, I double cleanse. The first cleanse is with a cleansing oil & I use this Tata Harper cleanser as the 2nd cleanse."

However, the quality of the ingredients paired with the cruelty-free production and ethical standards of the company do qualify it to be a higher priced product in my book. Since company is so high end, the pump should be better (I know I’m not the only one who experienced this issue)... third, you must moisturize afterward. I’m currently debating my moisturizer and I would try Tata’s since I like the company except I refuse to pay upwards of $100 for the tiny bottle (sorry, I know it’s high end, but that’s bonkers). I will say, one bottle does last me 6 months which comes out to less than $15 a month which is decent. Overall, a great product if you can afford it, but if you’re ballin on a budget, probably not for you. (And please fix the pump design, Tata!!!)"

My face comes out feeling like I've had a facial. Every day. I was very surprised how much of a difference it's made. One suggestion. Get the pump. The tube makes it easy to use way too much and the pump dispenses the perfect amount. And this stuff is too expensive to waste it, so in the long run the pump will save you money"

At first I just felt like I was doing it wrong so I thought I would clarify this for anyone else trying this cleanser.  I love it.

But you serious do not need a lot! So not only does it feel amazing on your skin, but I have VERY sensitive skin and it does not irritate it whatsoever. I haven’t had a product I was this happy with in a while. There were dramatic results for me overnight! A little story about my sensitive skin for you - this past weekend my mom got a new laundry detergent and when she hugged me I could tell it was different. That very day my face started breaking out. I had about 20 teeny tiny zits on my cheeks. Made my cheeks extremely red. I got the kit on Monday, by the way, Monday morning I woke up and my face was so red it looked like I just put blush all over my cheeks. So that night I got home from work, washed my face, put the mast on, cleaned it off then used the moisturizer. Tuesday - Not only did I only have THREE zits but ALL the redness was gone. This has been like a miracle kit for my sensitive skin! It feels great, it doesn’t burn, and the mask doesn’t get so hard it hurts your face. I definitely recommend this to someone with highly sensitive skin. I don’t know if it’s supposed to help with breakouts too but it definitely worked for that too!"

This truly does it ALL.  I have definitely been noticing a difference in my skin in the past few weeks. I use this after taking off my make up with the Boscia Makeup Breakup Cleansing Oil. The Tata cleanser really helps to get off all of the dirt and pollution from the day, and soften the skin to get it ready for other products.   Some people have complained about the pump/nozzle. I however, think it's right for this cleanser. You want to apply this dry, and you really don't need more than 3 or 4 pumps as it spreads well. Plus, at $78, do you really want it to pump out a huge gob where you don't even need that much?  Pro tip: use this layered under the resurfacing mask!"

If TH decides to remove the grains, I'd be all over this product - it makes my skin soft, smooth and with that ethereal glow after cleansing. I would seriously replace one of my current cleansers with this instead. The scent is pleasant and I don't see any red flags in the ingredient list (besides a couple of potentially irritating oils--but my skin is not sensitive). No harsh surfactants, no foamy lather but still gets the job done. It's a great second step cleanser after using a balm to remove makeup. You also only need a tiny bit of product to clean the entire face. The foil sample lasted me 5 uses, and I was generous with the amount I applied.  Unfortunately, the grains are a deal breaker for me. I've moved away from physical exfoliation as it could damage or irritate skin, and I rely on chemical exfoliation instead. I would most likely end up using this like a treatment rather than a daily cleanser. And I already have a very good arsenal of masks and treatments, plus a good rotation of 2-3 cleansers, so this product, while effective for my skin, simply doesn't have a place in my routine."

			"review_text": "One of the most critical steps to maintain a good, healthy looking, moisturized, young looking skin is to have a good cleansing/exfoliating system in place. Cell turn over slows down as we age, and the single way to speed this process up is the usage of AHA, BHA, enzymes and retinoids. All these guys remove layers of dead cells sitting on top of our skin (we have over 30 layers of dead cells!), so newer Cells can show up sooner. An effective cleanser will allow the serums and mosturizers to really penetrate into the skin, plumping and repairing it. Unfortunatelly most exfoliators damage and dry up your skin, so you have to be dilligent and do your research when picking up a good exfoliator. Avoiding plastic bids is crucial here.  So...you need to find products that are effective but also  kind on your skin.  Now, you want a gentle daily exfoliator, and also a stronger weekly mechanical exfoliator, to maintain a good system.  Having said all that, I firmly believe that this is, in my opinion, one of the best products in the market to maintain a radiant, younger looking skin. This product is absolutely outstanding. Gentle yet effectively will remove a good amount of debris every morning, guaranteeing that the rest of your skincare penetrates deeply into your Skin. Wont make your skin feel dry, tense or uncomfortable. The cocktail of ingredients is just perfect. Apricot seeds, pink clay, willow bark and others are just the right combo to do the job. The use of this product will shrink your pores and make your skin glow and feel comfortable, even if you are using retinoids. I typically use it over dry skin , every morning, and follow up with my Tatcha plumping Essence. The result? Gorgeous soft skin that keep getting compliments.  As a collateral... I have cut in half the amount of foundation I need.  Fantastic product. Im so glad that they listened and change the package. The squeezy tube is just perfect to deliver this product.  A must."

I wasn't sure at first how much of this I should use at a time but now I use three to four pumps of this only in the mornings. I use this to give my face a good 'scrub' on dry skin, then I wet my hands and continue to rub until the formula starts to dissolve. Then I rinse. This product rinses much 'cleaner' if you use it in this way and you may not need a second cleanse. I do however use a pump of Sunday Riley Ceramic Slip afterwards just because I'm oily/combination-skinned and I treat this as more of an exfoliant than a complete cleanser.  I ONLY use this in the mornings or before masks because this is not intended to be used on 'wet skin' and it is definitely NOT a makeup removing cleanser. I suggest removing your makeup beforehand and drying your face completely before you use this or you will be sorely disappointed  in this product!   Now that I use the right amount of product for my face, I've really come to love this stuff! It is soo exfoliating and has a lovely non-chemical scent. I find it to be very scruby even though the particles are super fine which I love. Great exfoliating cleanser for sure."

First of all, this is the first time I feel compelled to write a review For a product, it was that disappointing. First of all, the most frustrating thing about this cleanser was that it did not make my face feel clean, I always felt the need to wash my face with a foaming cleanser first and then use this just for the exfoliating properties. It did exfoliate but that isn't surprising since it has rough pieces in it, crushed apricot pits, or something like that. Next, the MOST annoying part of the incredibly expensive product (for what it is) the pump stops working after 3 or so times of use, and I had to get creative with getting the product out of the bottle, not easy when you are trying to wash your face, I like to pump and get on with my routine. Also, this is such a small amount, truly if you use the $40 bottle twice a day, you will run out of the product in about 3 weeks, I'm being generous.  I was so incredibly disappointed in this product especially since I went into this believing I was going to be blown away. I ended up keeping it only because by the time I gave this product enough time to give it a chance, 2 weeks, and one more week only using it once a day since it was running out, I had hardly any left. I didn't want to be that person that uses most of a product and then returning it. I would never buy this again and I would never recommend this. I did love the smell however, I suppose that's something? However I picked up the Ole Henricksen African Red Tea cleanser and it smells similar if not better. I also use Bobbi Browns Oil cleanser before the OH and use and enzyme peel daily to exfoliate and my skin looks and feels amazing.  I didn't even finish this bottle, I will give it to a friend to test."

Unfortunately, it doesn't have enough power to take off my makeup and/or sunscreen in the evening.

I don't know why this took me so long to finally do, but I am so glad I did. Tata Harper is more pricey than other brands, but it is 100% worth it.  I wake up, put one pump (that's all you need for your whole face) on my dry face, and rub it around in small circles. I then rinse it off with lukewarm water. I apply my face serum (Previse), followed by my coffee bean eye cream (100% Pure), then finish with a face lotion (Kahina Giving Beauty), and my EOS lib balm. I get a TON of compliments on my skin.  If you're ready to commit to a natural, non-toxic product, this is the best one to buy. If you're only going to buy one, buy this one.I'm 32, olive skin, and combating the first signs of aging.

Once I am satisfied I rinse everything to make sure there is no residue left behind. Yes, this is expensive, but you really don't need to use a lot and I feel that it will last for AGES.  The gentle exfoliating effect helps to keep my skin smooth and to get rid of any flakes that I might have. I use prescription strength retinol on my face 3 times a week, BHA exfoliator twice a day and other BHA's and this is still gentle enough for me.  I am not to crazy on the smell of it.

Unfortunately I expect vegan/natural brands to often be not a very nice quality, fragrance etc so I would not have expected this to be so nice as it is. Absolutely gorgeous quality - amazing fragrance (exquisitely fresh!), effective exfoliater without being harsh, great texture. Just love it; I usually rotate between 2 different evening cleansers so this replaces my other previous exfoliating one. My only complaint is that it is kind-of a small size for the price."

It is natural so it does not have chemicals which I love since I have been organic everything for about 2 years now. I have tried other high end organic products but ths stuff workd way better.

I use it either as my second cleanse in the evening or as my morning cleanse and it is fantastic. Not irritating, not drying, not in any way offensive to my skin (which can be quite sensitive). I would not use this as my first cleanse in the evening (makeup/sunscreen removal) as I only use cleansing balms/oils for that but as a second cleanse it is fantastic. No big scratchy particles tearing up your skin but incredibly effective. I was so not surprised to see Caroline Hirons recommend this recently. It really is that fabulous."

When I called Sephora they offered to send out a brand new replacement at no charge! What a lovely surprise to be greeted with such outstanding service. TATA Harper now has the premium spot on my sink. After a couple of weeks of regular use I am thrilled with my skin. Winters in Iowa are harsh but this cleanser has smoothed out and brightened my face and makes even the coldest snow and wind storms a distant memory each night. The light smell is intoxicating as well. Nicely done. I would recommend this to women and men as my husband tried it too...but he has to get his own bottle because this is mine mine mine!"

For me at least, I like the business model of this line. That alone isn't enough to make me LOVE a product, but in this case, it added a few bonus points in understanding the brand.  This product is to be started on dry skin. This bothered me a little at first, but I did as instructed. It is creamy enough to use on dry skin - so I use it right before I jump in the shower.  It is very rich with the perfect size and amount of microbeads (aka 'very small grit'.) It is gentle. It leaves my skin looking and feeling wonderfully smooth, resurfaced and polished.  I liked the way my skin looked immediately. After two weeks, I actually had co-workers commenting that my skin looked 'brighter' and they asked if I was 'doing something different.  My skin does look smoother, brighter and more even.  I have terrible combination skin, so 3-4 times I week, after I use this, I do a 'double cleanse' with my anti-acne cleanser. This is NOT because this product doesn't clean enough - but I am prone to cystic acne and I am unwilling to give up my acne prevention steps.  This wonderful cleanser does not over-dry my dry areas. In fact, I develop dry patches quickly and this cleanser eliminated one pesky patch completely in just a few days.  It is nicely scented and although it may sound weird, it doesn't make me sneeze (Sadly this can be a problem with me so I am always relieved when a scented product I like doesn't make me sneeze!)  Overall - it is a wonderful cleanser and exfoliator. After 30 days of use, I am convinced this is a winner and will remain part of my regular skincare regime."
