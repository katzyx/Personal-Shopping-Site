This tanner stained my skin and every single hole my hairs grew out of. It looked like I hadn't shaved at all even after the freshest shave. Had to return"

I also used the original version of St. Tropez for many years which is pretty nice but a little bit orange and kinda light. This product however is INCREDIBLE, it actually blew me away. I have a slight olive skin tone already and this looks EXACTLY like I was tanning in the Med for a couple of days. YES it is SLIGHTLY difficult to spread and it may look splotchy, but no fear! If you accidentally layer too much it isn't going to make you look tanner in those areas. I put moisturizer on my elbows and knees and spread it around with a mitt and left it on for about 1 hour 45 and showered it off, it looks so natural and blended it's blowing my MIND. I def don't think I will keep it on the whole 6-8 hours because the color is so natural. I can't wait to see how long this lasts!"

The color is super natural looking and dark. My tan stayed on without fading for a solid 7 days and I had to use a tan remover to get rid of it (only because I wanted a fresh tan for an event) my only complaint is that it's very odd looking right after application so once it's applied I wouldn't leave the house. I also think it would be a disaster if you didn't prep properly before applying."

Im not sure how or why but it feels like I was in the sun all day and it looks like it! The smell is amazing and the results make me look like a coconut!

I will definitely be buying this again! st tropez never lets me down ü´∂üèº I do have experience with self tanner so I knew it wouldn't make me orange or anything since I naturally am olive in tone.

I love that that it goes on brown so I know where I‚Äôve been and where the streaks are. I much prefer the brown versus the usual orange look of self tanner. Now, where I think this falls short: it is a tad bit streaky and it dyed my pores and all my hair follicles BLACK. The streakiness wasn‚Äôt bad tbh and may be user error, and the pores might go away with some gentle exfoliation, but rn the pores are a nope for me. Overall, I will probably reach for this one over others that I‚Äôve used."

The instructions say 8 hours, but it was so unbearably sticky, I couldn't leave it on another minute. (There's no way someone could comfortably sleep in this) The end result was a dark, slightly orange tan. It looked blended, so that was a plus, but I would definitely pass on this one.

I have been a huge fan of St. Tropez self tanners for more years than I can remember.  But I swear in the last year or so the formula changed.  This new shade came out and of course I had to have it!  And I am so disappointed.  The formalist is so streaky and patchy.  And I know the drill- I exfoliate and use tan remover, I moisturize.  I moisturize my dry spots prior to application and wait for that to dry down.  I wear gloves and use St. Tropez self tan applicator mitt‚Ä¶. It‚Äôs just not good.  Now as for the color‚Ä¶. I also have used St. tropez extra dark plenty and that has a green base, so I knew what to expect.  But, this violet formula  is not a shade for us fair skin girlies. It‚Äôs far too cool and looks extremely unnatural.  It probably is*** a great shade for other people though.  I just can‚Äôt get over what happened to the formula"

It was definitely more concentrated so I had to be careful and use less in smaller areas. I love that you can rinse it off after 30 minutes for a quick subtle tan or 8 hours for the deepest tan.

I have used St. Tropez products in the past, and the Ashley Graham collab was my favorite.   So now to this product. It goes on super streaky and you really have to rub it in a lot. You definitely need a mitt to apply. The bottle says leave on for 1 hr and rinse for a light tan, and 8 hrs for a full, olive shade. I tried the 1 hr first, and it gave a pretty nice, subtle tan. The next day I did the full 8 hrs and it was noticeably darker. I wouldn't really say this gave me an olive tone, though. For me (I have a naturally olive complexion) it was more sun-kissed bronze.   One thing I didnt love is that if you have even an inkling of stubble anywhe, the color picks up on alll those little pores. If you're Italian like me and your hair grows minutes after you shave, you may experience this problem, too.   Overall, I'd say this is decent. I'll definitely use the rest of the bottle but may try a different product next time."

I love that I can apply it and leave it on for a bit while I'm doing things around the house, and then rinse it off. The color then intensifies for the next couple of hours.

My favorite part is that I can wear this for 8 hours to achieve the deepest color or rinse it off in as little as 30minutes-1 hour to achieve a pretty glow (I go the full 8 but I will utilize this in a pinch) ! I always appreciate a tinted tanning foam opposed to clear so I know where I already applied during application to get a streak free even tan, that even gives me a bit of instant color gratification as well. I always have a hard time with tanning foams being drying but this was actually hydrating so it felt really nice to apply without any tugging on the skin. I really love the way it has faded over the coarse of about a week, usually I get a large white patch under my breast area where tans rub off and it looks crazy but this one faded out pretty evenly so it‚Äôs not looking super uneven before my next tanning application. It did last a while which i was quite happy about, tanning foams usually come off me pretty quickly because I do a body shower every single day with a loofah and body wash!  St.Tropez has been a go to tanning brand of mine for a long time and I was really excited to try out and see how the new supreme violet mousse looks, overall I really loved this and I will be repurchasing this supreme violet mousse instead of their dark bronzing mouse which I usually use. I finally found the darkest natural olive tan I can use at home that compares to or even tops tanning salon spray tans! (I think I love this more than the dark Venetian spray tan in the versa booth from the tanning salon & I was obsessed with those lol) 10/10 from me, if your thinking about purchasing just do yourself a favor and get it, spring/ summer is right around the corner!"

I was a bit worried since it said olive tan on the bottle that it would look strange on me because I have more neutral undertones, but it's perfect. I also really appreciate that it doesn't have a chemical smell. I've tried it overnight (for the full 8 hours) and for 30 minutes (then rinse as the bottle says) and I didn't smell anything crazy either time. One thing to keep in mind is the tan is deeper when left for the full eight hours, but the 30-minute hack will definitely work in a pinch! This is also the most even self-tan I've ever experienced. I don't see any weird spots, even on my ankles/feet/knees. I was so pleasantly surprised with the results that I ended up taking a photo and sending it to multiple people. They all loved the color of the tan too! Highly recommend. I was gifted by sttropez, but these are my honest thoughts."

I've tried oodles of liquid tan products, and when I was gifted a St. Tropez Self Tan Supreme Violet Bronzing Mousse, I was more than ecstatic.   What sets this tanner apart from all the others is the color that you'll achieve.  You're results will be a natural, deep, stunning olive tan.  It has a unique violet base that balances the tone of your skin to reach those gorgeous results.   In my experience, the color achieved was truly remarkable and stands out as the best I have ever used.   The application is easy, but you definitely need an application glove.  The drawback that I can say is that it's sticky after applying it.  You can wash it off in 30 mins but waiting 8 hrs will bring you the deepest results.  I put on an old shirt and sweatpants and waited the full 8 hr.   Upon application the color will be a quite intense, keep in mind you need to shower off the excess leaving you with a beautiful, healthy, streak-free golden tan.  It is scented, however it's very light, pleasant and dissipates fast.  In my experience, the tan lasted for about 5 days and faded evenly, except for the hands which lighten faster due to frequent washing.   I recommend this to all self tanners looking for that beach ready, natural olive, gorgeous tan. "

So the full 8 hours for me looked kind of silly! But I adore the natural glow I get with leaving it on for 30 mins and rinsing off with water. This is my new go to brand for sure. Make sure you have a GOOD mit. I used a cheap one that came with a different product, and my thumbs popped out of it while applying. So my thumbs and nails were stained the first time. But, the new glove I got fixed that problem. I really love that you can control the color. You can either have a nice little bronzed glow, or that deep olive bronzed tone.

The first thing that struck me was the luxurious texture of the mousse‚Äîit glided effortlessly onto my skin, ensuring even application without streaks. The violet undertones in the formula not only provided a natural-looking tan but also helped to counteract any orange hues, leaving behind a gorgeous sun-kissed glow. I appreciated how quickly it dried, allowing me to go about my day without feeling sticky or waiting for hours to get dressed. What truly sets this product apart is its longevity. Unlike other self-tanners that fade within days, the Supreme Violet Bronzing Mousse held up remarkably well, maintaining its color for over a week with proper care. However, it's worth noting that the scent, while pleasant initially, can become slightly overpowering as the tan develops. Additionally, for those with very fair skin, the violet undertones may appear too dark, so a patch test is advisable. Overall, I highly recommend the Supreme Violet Bronzing Mousse for anyone looking for a high-quality self-tanner that delivers long-lasting, streak-free results with a beautiful violet undertone."

This one just seems extra dark. Being with how pasty I am right now, it didn't work very very well for me. I found it a little hard to blend in as it dried pretty quickly. It has a really nice fragrance, not that burnt popcorn smell like most self-tanners. This one actually smells like a light pretty floral fragrance . I You appreciate the fact that I can see where I'm putting it for more even distribution. I would recommend applying this early in the morning because you definitely have to wash it off. Otherwise it's going to look very splotchy, super dark and really crazy. Once you rinse off that first initial application then it ends up looking beautiful even and like a natural bronze tan. So far I've had it on for over a week and it is not starting to peel or get splotchy ! Overall, I think this is a great self-tanner I think it would work better for me.

Without using a glove or mitten I have perfected application to hands and feet. However, this one took me by surprise. Now this is designed to provide a natural deep olive tan, so definitely would suggest for those with a deeper natural skin tone who wish to accentuate and get that deep, Sunkissed glow. It is suggested to use a mitten for application leave on for 8 hours, and then rinse. The foam is lightweight and the scent is amazing. Self tanner doesn‚Äôt always smell very nice but this one is delightful. Such a pretty fragrance. I caution you do need to move very fast with this product as it stains the skin right away. Or at least with me and I am pretty fair. I was nervous about transfer to clothing, so slept with this product on overnight on dark sheets. There is no way I could go out in public with this tanner on my skin upon immediate application. Once I rinsed, it was definitely very dark, and it streaky. I think for someone not as fair as I this would be a great option. Also, now that I understand how this works, I think I could have a more successful application, The quality is impeccable and the tan really lasts. The downside to me is how quickly it dries and I did find that there was transfer on objects and clothing."

As someone with sensitive skin, I'm always cautious about trying new products, but this bronzing mousse proved to be gentle and non-irritating.  First off, let's talk about the results. The bronzed and golden glow it gave my skin was absolutely stunning. It looked natural and radiant, without any hint of orange. Plus, the color lasted impressively well‚ÄîI've taken multiple showers since applying it, and the color hasn't faded one bit.  One thing that really stood out to me was the scent. Unlike other tanning products that often have a strong, yeasty odor, this one had a much more pleasant scent. It was subtle and didn't linger uncomfortably, which I appreciated. Applying the mousse was a breeze. It went on smoothly and evenly, without any streaks or patches. What's more, it dried surprisingly quickly, which meant I could go about my day without feeling sticky or waiting around for it to set.  After wearing it for the day and washing it off, I was thrilled to find that there were no streaks left behind‚Äîa common issue I've encountered with other self-tanners. The evenness of the color was impressive, and it looked just as good after washing it off as it did when I first applied it.  Overall, I can't recommend the St. Tropez Supr√™me Violet Bronzing Mousse enough. It delivers beautiful, long-lasting results without any of the drawbacks typically associated with self-tanning products. Whether you have sensitive skin like me or simply want a flawless bronzed look, this mousse is definitely worth trying."

I applied it before bed and slept in it for 8-10 hrs. When I woke up, I was super dark! I‚Äôve never been that dark with a self tanner so I was so excited. When rinsing it off, I noticed a ton of color rinsed off in the shower. After drying off, it was nowhere near as dark as before. It gave a good natural glow, but I was expecting a super deep color. It went on super even and streak free. The consistency was great. I will continue using the bottle but I‚Äôm not sure I would get it again based only on the fact that most of the color was the bronzer that rinsed off. If you‚Äôre looking for a more natural tan, I would highly recommend this. But not for a dark tan."

This product exceeded my expectations in every way possible. First and foremost, the application process was a breeze. The mousse texture glided smoothly onto my skin, allowing for easy, streak-free coverage. It dried quickly, which meant I could get dressed without worrying about it transferring onto my clothes. What truly sets this self-tanner apart is its natural-looking results. Instead of an orangey hue, it gave me a gorgeous, sun-kissed glow that looked like I had just returned from a weekend in St. Tropez. The color developed gradually over a few hours, leaving me with a believable tan that lasted for days. I also appreciated the hydrating properties of this formula. Unlike other self-tanners that can leave your skin feeling dry and tight, the St. Tropez mousse left my skin feeling soft and moisturized. Overall, I highly recommend the St. Tropez Self Tan Bronzing Mousse to anyone looking for a reliable, streak-free self-tanning option. With its easy application, natural-looking results, and long-lasting color, it's become a staple in my beauty routine. Say hello to a sun-kissed glow, courtesy of St. Tropez!"

I really enjoyed this violet mousse, application went so easily and it didn‚Äôt have that awful self tanner smell that some other self tanners have. waiting the recommended timeframe and rinse I was left with a beautiful olive tan. My skin is fair and this developed into a beautiful tan that wasn‚Äôt orangey at all. Down the line I would love to see them come out with an express version of this product! I really enjoyed this self tanner and I think it will be one of my new go to‚Äôs when summer comes around! Would definitely recommend this product! Gifted by st tropez"

If you love a deep olive tan, this is the perfect tanner for you. The application is so easy with a mitt or even vinyl gloves, and after you sleep and it develops overnight, you have the richest tan that makes you look like you just came back from vacation. I highly recommend it! I paired this with St Tropez's face mist, and it was the best tan."

This gives such a stunning olive tan color. Dare I say it even looks natural??? I can't wait to use this when I'm actually not just wearing sweaters in the wintertime! This does have a self tanner smell but I sleep in mine and wash it off in the morning so I see no issue. There is a color guard which I appreciate so that I know where my tanner is going. That being said, make sure to let it dry down before getting into bed. Also, if you tend to sweat at night, use dark sheets or ones you don't care much about getting tanner on. Overall, this is awesome and I will be repurchasing! This was gifted by sttropez but I ll repurchase!"
