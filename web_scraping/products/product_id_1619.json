I wouldn’t really say it has full full coverage, but it's definitely there. If you’re looking for a very full coverage powder, this is not for you. The packaging is the best part! It’s so cute. The heart shape combined with the gold and pink is adorable! The mirror inside is very clear and did not get bogged up with powder which sometimes happens. This powder is actually so good at giving a semi-matte appearance and it’s perfect. For reference, I have oily and acne prone skin. This also doesn’t break me out, which is surprising since I break out very easily and need to be very careful. I would repurchase! I don’t know how long that would take though, since the powder has a lot of product!"

I am happy with the coverage it provides - it's a good shade match for my fair skin. However, I agree with everyone elses comments about how little product is provided. For $54 this compact should be WAY bigger. I have had this powder for a little over a week and I have already hit pan. Now, I do use powder as my primary foundation because i'm very oily so I don't wear regular foundation, so I do use a decent amount of product. But still - I think for this price tag there should be no reason I have hit pan already. My drug store powder would last me 2-3 months at least. I want to continue using this but I don't know if I can justify the price."

Really helps to hide texture."

I didn’t wear any other facial make up.  I found this to be a great substitute when I don’t want to apply skin tint, blush, etc. The powder is blurring and looked fine on my skin.  I think the heart shape takes away from the process of application because it is heart shape. However, I like that this item contains a mirror."

I've tried CT and huda and many others and I've never felt this way about them. I also have tried a lot of loose formulas and I just don't like any until I found this one. I have combo dehydrated skin with dry undereyes with lots of creasing and this is the best powder I've ever used.

I also really appreciate that it’s non comedogenic, and doesn’t break out my sensitive, acne prone skin.  One of the things I like most about this powder is how lightweight it feels. Even when I layer it on top of my foundation and concealer, it never looks cakey. It’s perfect for mattifying the T zone, but I do find that I need to touch up every few hours. I have larger pores, and while I didn’t notice a magically dramatic difference, I did see a slight blurring effect on my cheeks.  I have a big issue with the shade range. Four shades just aren’t inclusive enough, and I feel like brands should really know better by now. There’s no excuse for not offering a wider range of shades to suit all skin tones. It’s disappointing because the product itself is great, but the limited shade range makes it less accessible.  If you can find a shade that works for you, I think this setting powder is worth a try, especially if you’re looking for a setting powder that’s gentle on sensitive, acne prone skin. But the shade range could use improvement."

I’m happy to say that this one had no scent. I feel like this did a decent job at helping cut the oily shine my skin often gets with makeup wear. It held up well for 5+ hours in 80+ degree weather, which impressed me. The powder wasn’t overly heavy and it didn’t make my foundation or concealer under it feel or look cakey. Plus it did a good job at helping set the concealer on my under eye area. Definitely a lot of wins with this product.   Now the biggest reason I took a star off is because I had issues with the powder making my ‘peach fuzz’ on my face more noticeable in my opinion. Plus the fact that they only offer four shades for this product. In this day and age for a brand to be more inclusive, they need to offer more shades in my opinion."

The texture is incredibly lightweight, almost as if it’s not even there, yet it provides a soft, blurred finish that’s perfect for setting my makeup. I noticed that it kept my face looking fresh throughout the day without feeling heavy or cakey, which is something I always look for in a setting powder.  One of the things I love most about this powder is its versatility. It works well whether I’m going for a more natural, no-makeup look or a full-glam appearance. It helps to subtly blur imperfections, giving my skin a smoother, more polished look without being too matte or too dewy. Plus, the fact that it’s flexible means it doesn’t settle into fine lines or emphasize dry patches, which is a huge win for me.  Overall, the Born This Way Soft Blur Setting Powder has become a staple in my makeup routine. It gives me that perfect finish every time, and I can trust it to keep my makeup in place all day long."

			"review_text": "Upon opening the product, I noticed that the packaging is not thick or bulky despite having a hard case which would make it super easy to throw into my bag on the go without it taking up too much space. The powder itself is scent less which I appreciate, and the texture is as advertised - soft, silky with a buttery feel that easily glides over the skin. No powder is able to hide extreme texture but this one does a pretty good job of blurring out any tiny blemishes. Overall, this is a great little compact face powder to have in my collection!"

It does help with complexion issues and helps hide some blemishes or bright acne. I was so happy about this product. It’s definitely a must have from now on"
