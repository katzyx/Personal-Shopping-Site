			"review_text": "Other reviewers basically say it’s not loud enough, but that’s the point.  The notes are of leather that turns into pepper.  It’s clean and masculine without smelling so much like generic cologne.  My favorite after a full day of sniffing and proud of my choice that I talked my husband into and he agrees."

			"review_text": "I didn’t select this at the time of purchase. I don’t know who thought a men’s sample cologne a good equivalent to Moroccan Oil or Sol de Janeiro, but here we are. This men’s cologne isn’t bad. The fragrance hits all of the notes referenced in the description and does appeal.  It honestly becomes harder and harder for me to want to maintain Rouge status with Sephora. There is almost always a significant price difference (not in the buyers favor) compared to the actual product/company site, but then to add insult to injury, they’re miserly with samples, promos, etc…"
