Alcohol-free, water-based formula..About the Bottle:These body sprays feature a neutral-colored aluminum can. Aluminum is a lightweight material that is easier and more energy efficient to recycle than glass and convenient to bring anywhere..About the Fragrance:I wanted to play with the juicy, succulence of blackberry and elevate its innate sensuality. I blended blackberry and musk for a blackberry-musk-infused effect, and then used mineral woods, like driftwood and cedar, for contrast and textured sensuality.—Pascal Gaurin, Perfumer",

Very well blended and I hope Henry Rose makes this a permanent scent!"

My only qualm is that the scent is so light that it fades before anyone else has the chance to experience it too. I held my arm up to my husband for him to sniff, only 30 mins after the initial spray, and he smelled nothing. I hope they turn this one into a stronger fragrance instead of a body spray."

It is not just about the scent; it's also about the aesthetics, and the bottle looks elegant on any vanity. This scent strikes a perfect balance between freshness and warmth. The body spray contains clean and sustainable ingredients. The longevity of Blonde Barry is impressive for a body spray, as it lingers throughout the day without being overpowering.

Although it is a unisex scent, I do feel that it leans feminine, but not so much so that I would find it out of place if a male friend or acquaintance was wearing it. The aluminum bottle has a clean and elegant design that reflects its price point. However, I was disappointed in how long it lasted. While it had more staying power in my hair, it faded more quickly than I would have expected for the cost."

For the first couple hours, I can't smell much else beyond the berrylicious notes, but it's quite summery and fruity. Blonde Barry is a blackberry-musk-infused scent, contrasted with mineral woods like driftwood and cedar. The sweetness of the blackcurrant and blackberries in this scent reminded me of being at a farmers market on an early summer day. Light, and fresh."

Blonde Barry is truly refreshing in every possible way - a lovely fresh scent that's gives citrus and berry vibes that comes in the most eco friendly packaging and container. The scent itself smells very natural and not too overpowering, that said the staying power is not too high. The spray comes in an aluminum bottle and the out packaging is completely recycled cardboard with no plastic whatsoever. I'm seriously in awe with this product and I highly recommend for a free spirited, eco conscious soul!!"

I smell a bit of wood, earthiness, and a nature scent to it with some patchouli and musk after the initial spray.  When it dries down, it becomes a summer fruity -powdery smell. The scent lasts longer than the average body spray but it will need to be resprayed for the same strength as when sprayed around the 3-hour mark, as it becomes a bit faint. This scent does have fruit and berry scent without being overly sweet and childish. There is some spice, powder, and cedar to balance it."

I'm not used to doing that with fragrances but I noticed the instructions said to shake well. The lasting power on this is not great. I think the smell fades away after a couple hours. The aluminum packaging is sleek, so I do like that. I think it's kinda pricey given the lasting power but the scent is very nice. So if you love it,  it may be worth it to you."

The bottle is so simple, elegant, pretty and just feels nice in my hand. I love the way it sprays. I didn’t fall in love with this scent the first time but there is something about the way it comes out of the spray bottle and feels on that made me give it a chance. It is a nice refreshing scent, but I can’t put my finger on what It is that is unlike what I normally wear.  I think maybe it’s more fruity than what I normally prefer. I tend to lean more towards the Musk and Patchouli top notes. I like the Blonde Barry and I think it’s a good fit for day wear for me. I am looking forward to trying the other scents from Henry Rose."
