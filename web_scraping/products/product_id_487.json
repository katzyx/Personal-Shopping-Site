I bought the color -Nudeattude - warm peachy nude and it goes on like a dream.   It’s moisturizing and glides on beautifully.  The color is richly pigmented and is a great nude.  Hopefully you can tell in the picture. I have on no makeup except for lipstick and I didn’t use a liner.   I am impressed with this brand and would definitely buy more colors and recommend to friends!   I’d you do not like matte lipsticks and want something that feels silky going on with nice pigment then this lipstick is for you"

Received my lipstick today and was disappointed.  This is a pretty color BUT it is more like a sheer coverage and not a regular lipstick.  It shines more than anything and I remember the Iconic Chocolate Raspberry did not shine like this.  You would have needed to add the shine to get this look.  I can buy this sheer shade way cheaper than $28 so will be returning unfortunately.  I saw one reviewer that bought the chocolate raspberry and if I had saw that first I would not have ordered because I would have saw the shine and knew immediately this is close but no cigar. I did not notice not one shimmer so not sure why shimmer is in the description. I did like some of the other colors so maybe I will swap it out but so sad this color cannot be duplicated by apparently NOBODY not even the creator.  I recommend if you are NOT expecting the EXACT formula from back in the day!!"

It's not weighted & kinda cheap looking. I was hoping for updated FF packaging. But when the Sephora Associate showed me this color, I was wowed. Plus it stayed on for a few hours. Unscented. Still feels like a win."

It's moisturising, the perfect my-lips-but-better colour, quite long-lasting, doesn't have a weird scent or anything, not waxy, and it doesn't leave a weird after-colour on my lips. It is perfection and I will happily repurchase again and again. Thank you FF for this winner of a lippy!!! Yayyyy! 100% recommend!"

			"review_text": "This is my first time trying Fashion Fair lipsticks and I have to say I really like the formula- I have quite dry and naturally lined lips but I find that this is extremely comfortable (better than chapstick) almost like a solid form of my full pigment lip glosses. It's very easy to apply and reapply for work/errands  One thing I do want to add, I think these color photos/swatches indicate how these colors will look on darker skin. Just be aware when you are choosing a shade that if you are not dark skinned the in-person-color may seem higher chroma/brighter. I have very fair skin and usually gray/dusty colors look pinky nude on me but on my own lips 'Lace' seems to be more of a neutral-warm brown/pink. It's lighter than my natural lip color so I fully expect that on a darker skin tone it will be a wearable, dusty nude pink color!  I added a photo of a swatch so you can compare it to Sephora's and hopefully it will be helpful to you!"

I purchased the famous Chocolate Raspberry lipstick and the cream to powder foundation. Sad to report, the lipstick does not have the same staying power, and the foundation shade was too much yellow undertone in the current Caremel Fresh. Beware you will need to test for your shade. For 23 yrs I wore FF products, for 8 yrs I was a FF Counter Manager, I know this product very well!  It's close but no home run, am so very sad to report."

Designed to hydrate lips with sunflower seed oil & rosemary leaf extract. Sunflower seed oil nourishes, soothes & strengthens dry lips. Rosemary leaf extract is an antioxidant that soothes irritated lips. This is a cruelty-free & vegan lipstick with no parabens & less than one percent synthetic fragrance. Offered in satin & shimmer finishes with a total of 14 shades to choose from.    My experience: I selected to try the Sepia shimmer finish lipstick. It’s a gorgeous bronze metallic shimmer lipstick & highly pigmented. It’s creamy & a very comfortable lipstick to wear even for a full day. My lips did not feel dry or become cracked as it does with some lipsticks. This has very minimal transfer even when eating or drinking. The lipstick packaging is gorgeous & luxurious.   Overall: I’ve really been enjoying the formulation, pigmentation & comfortable wear of this lipstick. It’s a stunning piece to display on your vanity but so much more then that. Retails for $26 which is pricy but I think worth the investment for a high quality vegan, crispy free lipstick. 5/5"

The line itself is iconic.) This lipstick is one of the best lipsticks I've ever worn. Seriously. And I have tons.

Every time I find this beautiful shade, I forget to stock up before it gets discontinued so this time I’m going to stock up.  I first had Uber Suede from Bobbi Brown, then Mac Touch. Both I bought years ago and both now discontinued. This one is on the expensive side but I really love the shade. It has the perfect satin or luster finish. This one goes in my purse for daily use. The quality is definitely point. The bullet is sturdy and magnetic so it’s good to drop in your purse without the top popping off or cracking. One thing to mention, check these out in the store. The online picture doesn’t look the same to me. It gives off a frosty appearance instead and the color seems off. I’m not sure about the other shades but I know Ganache is off."

Man the nostalgia of this brand brings back memories not only for me, but also my mom. She was soooooooooo happy when she found out that Fashion Fair was back!   To celebrate their return, I HAD to buy her, her favorite lipstick..Pure Plum...she put it on last night just because..and loved that it was so moisturizing. I love that Fashion Fair reformulated their products with skin benefits and modern ingredients!  Seriously, this is the best thing that ever came to Sephora..while I love all of the modern day brands, they really do speak to a younger generation of women, but Fashion Fair is an ICONIC brand that spans generations...even my grandma (who's 80 years old now) wore Fashion Fair. For context I'm 32 almost 33..so a total millennial..and just seeing this brand back really brings me joy and makes me happy for my mom and grandma to have a piece of their youth brought back.  Before there was Shades for all... and match your lipstick with your skin tone blah blah blah..Fashion Fair was creating beauty products for women of color long before any other brands were.   I'll be purchasing more products for my mom and grandma. Thanks Sephora for brining this back!!!!"
