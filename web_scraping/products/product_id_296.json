As said on the directions, use this product before blow-dryer heat and not heat from a hair straightener. this works really well when not used as a heat protectant which I initially tried to use it as and it made my hair feel crackly. Use before blow-drying and your hair will be soft and have less frizz while also feeling clean since you will not be able to feel the product on your hair afterwards. I use straight up blow-drying heat initially and then I go in with a precision blow-dry heating attachment to straighten my hair."

Went to a luau outside where it was very humid. Hair still looked good. The second day we went on a boat tour/snorkel tour and it still stayed frizz free after even getting in the water!

I show you what my hair normally looks like in the past few week then today after using this product."

Watched the tutorial how to use.

I was using the Garnier fruit humidity oil, and that wasn’t even working. I am so glad I bought this because this has been the only product that has beat the humidity and the only product that has gotten my hair straighter than usual even when blow drying. I am honestly amazed by this product and will continue to keep buying this. I’m not sure why people are not having the reviews, but this is a holy Grail product. My hair has never been this straight since I went to a salon once. I went into the garage and my hair did not puff up like usual. Usually the next day my hair is very frizzy or curly in the back. There is no sign of either that. I also have 3b/3c type hair."

I have afro-curly (hair typing is stupid but type 4 for your reference). I bought this product specifically for my trip to Atlanta & Savannah Georgia, USA (iykyk). It’s important that you already have a hair care product system  for blowouts/silk presses, if you don’t have that then you’re already going about it wrong. Do your own research to create or buy a line that works for you. After using my line, I went in with Dry Bar’s Liquid Glass Moisture-Rich Miracle Smoothing Sealant, theeeeeen I spray in the Color Wow Dream Coat all over. Think you sprayed enough? Nope, spray again. Enough now? Just a touch more! So yes I use two different anti-humidity sealants to ensure my fro is maintained. It lasted throughout my trip, though I sweated my roots out from playing with my nephew but one pass with flat iron and I was good. Overall, I really like this product and if used correctly, you can have your silk press or blow out even longer than usual."

It will only be activated once it has been blowdried in.   My advice : If you think you've sprayed enough, spray again!!"
