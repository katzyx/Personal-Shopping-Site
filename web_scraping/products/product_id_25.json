It makes my lips look and feel smooth. Very nourishing tbh. This is not sticky, even if the wand dispenses a generous amount of product to coat the lips. I've never had that stringiness. I love the big doefoot applicator too omg. This is amazing for a high end lip oil, totally worth it. I dont like to spend more than $14 on a lip product bc I think it's stupid for such a small amount of product but I love this stuff, it's incredible."

These have a sweet light scent, like vanilla cookies and feel amazing on my dry lips. A little sticky but I don't mind that at all.

This shade (Bliss) is especially good if you have a lighter complexion. However, it would honestly look amazing in all skin. This is a great product. It is easy to apply and applies very smoothly on your lips. If I could re-order any makeup product, it would be this! It is so spectacular! I would recommend it to anyone!

I reached out to the brand and they claimed it was unmixed pigment and that it was not mold, however they did not want to share any information about lab results in the tests they ran on the black substance. They claimed it was safe to use and nothing to worry about.  I asked Sephora to ship a new one and it came just the same. I love the feel of this lip oil and the fact that it really does leave my lips more hydrated than before use, but I genuinely question why the brand wouldn't recall these items. As a small brand, I imagine it's not easy and would be a lot of money lost, but it would probably reassure customers that they're dedicated to top quality and nothing less."

The shade Romance is described, aptly for the holiday season, as a cranberry shade, but this beautiful color can be worn all year-round. This is my honest & authentic opinion, as a Sephora Beauty Insider Community Ambassador.   WHAT I LIKE: * CONSISTENCY: Thick without being too heavy or goopy; not sticky or tacky * APPLICATION: Applies easily and smoothly; did not smear, bleed or run * PERFORMANCE: Hydrating and nourishing, comfortable to wear; gives a smooth look to my lips (can't see all the lines as easily - a definite plus! in my book) * VERSATILITY: Can be worn by itself, with a lip pencil, or over lipstick * FINISH: Beautiful, richly pigmented color; leaves a gorgeous glossy shine on lips   AREA(S) FOR IMPROVEMENT: * None, really; but if I'm allowed to be a little greedy, I wouldn't mind if the brand introduced even more shades and finishes. 😉  FYI:  * Unscented (as far as I could tell) * Doe foot applicator * One of my favorite formulations as far as lip oils go * The Romance shade (cranberry) is one of my favorite colors in the lip oil range * Highly recommend * Makes a great gift - for yourself or someone else   BUY 🛍️ or BYE 👋🏼?: * An absolute BUY; this will easily become a repeated repurchase"

I prefer color with a neutral undertone (on occasion with a cool undertone) in mid to deep shades. These are my first impressions.  This lip oil reminds me of another lip oil I love (similar price point). I only wish it were more pigmented. It's a beautiful mid brown shade that needs to be seen. I'm not a fan of the scent, but it's light enough to ignore/not notice it. I would love for the brand to make these more pigmented and to introduce a deep purple (not plum) to the line.

It's nourishing, fragrance free and lasts longer than any other lip oil I've tried.  Romance is a sheer but slightly buildable brown berry shade that's flattering on all skintones, from the vampire pale (like me) to deep, and the shimmer free finish  gives a plumped look without the minty, cooling or tingling sensation.  I can't recommend this lip oil enough and I'll definitely repurchase Romance once I finish the tube from the set!"

I tried scraping the sides of the tube with the applicator to see if it was just trapped product or maybe the lighting doing something weird, but it wouldn’t budge, and it felt off. no idea what it is, but it shouldn’t be there when a lip product is brand new, especially because it’s only on the one side of the oil (see the two pictures for comparison). I was also shocked at how sticky the formulation felt even though this is not a gloss?? super bizzare & disappointed as I love the color and sheerness of the product. I returned it."

Not sticky. However, I personally find it to be *so* thick that I hesitate to use it over other glosses. It is viscous in a way that feels like a more liquid Aquaphor. Again this is not a 'bad' thing, Aquaphor is great, but I don't enjoy this sensation on my lips. *Look: Love the color. A soft cozy brown with a subtle shine/glow."

Cue drinking coffee and having a snack and not only was most of it still on, but I had actually forgotten I was wearing it (it's that comfortable). I swiped it off after eating so that I could reapply and my lips were now so soft. It's definitely thicker than the oil I tried before but it does clearly say on the package that it's a oil to gloss formula and that's exactly what it is. It's not too thick and sticky nor is it too slippery and thin. I wear mine by itself or with brown lip liner and love it so much. Bonus points for all the good stuff about it!

To get the residual feeling to go away you have to use some sort of makeup remover (oil, balm, micellar water).   After removing the oil, my lips don’t feel dry but they don’t necessarily feel nourished either. I have the clear shade; reflection,  and I like to wear it both alone and over top of other tints to give my lips a high shine effect. I don’t feel like the packaging is messy, and I do like the big applicator foot. It has a very subtle sweet scent. So subtle your nose really has to be up against the oil to smell it. But it is pleasant.Overall, this is a nice formula for other great ingredients. If you don’t mind a thick oil, you should like this!"

The presentation of the Rosy Brown color looked perfect to me and I love a good lip gloss or oil, the problem with this particular lip gloss is that when applying it does promise a nice color but it soon fades and the color is neither Rosy or Brown..it's just another clear lip gloss. But the worst part for me was that after it being applied it creates a nasty looking film on the corners of my lips which is not attractive at all!! I think when it comes to lip glosses that give u a nice full glossy pout I will stick with Lawless. So far my favorite."

Bonne Bell flashbacks - the formula: makes my lips burn ever so slightly, tends to leave them dry and irritated. Difficult to apply evenly, at least for me. It has a tendency to pool on certain parts of the lip, and slip away on others, as it wears   It’s not horrible but not worthy of the hype in my opinion.

It has a slight tint that goes with the everyday casual look but also goes with dressy loos as well. The only con is with the packaging; if not closed super tight, it will leak a bit.

The product has a nice applicator which makes it easy to apply the product to the lips in one take. I appreciate that the formula isn’t tacky but is more on the thicker consistency side than normal lip oils and love the gloss shine it gives.  I have already been looking at other shades and have even gifted one to another BIC member because she raved about the product and wanted it in a different color for the Galentine gift exchange.  I would definitely recommend this product to anyone that is interested in a lip oil."

This is definitely a nude but with the perfect pop of shiny shimmer in the gold. It is neither too yellow or too orange, it lives somewhere in the middle, so it compliments a myriad of skin tones, from deeper to fairer. As with all of Ami Colé lip treatment oils, this feels light going on with a coverage that is incredible. It’s long lasting but your lips will never realize it. I wore it alone and was really pleased to have the subtlety of a nude with the playfulness of the shimmery look. It wasn’t over the top, nor was it indistinguishable. I also paired it with a chestnut lipliner for a darker shade and it held up even better—dare I say it— than my fave Excellence! This is great for every day wear or for going out. Lined, unlined, whatever. This is such a beautiful shade. Definitely putting this one on a subscription!"

Those familiar know 'Oh Baby' is a golden, shimmery brown gloss, but the Ami Colé version doesn't have the chunky gold glitter so it's better. Feels great on the mouth and wears wear with and without liner. Love wearing with Ami Colé complexion products, specifically Desert Date Cream Blush & Lip Multistick in Dune.

I've ordered multiples of every single shade they currently offer from Ami Cole directly, and have also purchased a backup of Excellence from Sephora. I guess you might say I'm a bit of a fan of this product, lol.  The new shade is absolutely gorgeous. Its a sheerish nude with very fine, non-gritty gold shimmer. I think it's absolutely perfect for all skintones and for summer. the formula is the same one we know and love. To me, this is essentially skincare. SO hydrating and flattering, insanely comfortable. It's not super long-wearing, but no product of this nature is. And it's an actual joy to reapply. While the color doesn't last like it would with a lip stain or bullet lipstick, the hydration genuinely does.  I photographed the new next to some of the other shades I have. I couldn't find my Bliss so that one isn't pictured. I'm so excited Ami Cole is branching out into shimmer and I hope they release endless more shades. Goodness knows I'll buy them all, probably multiple times over. This lip oil is definitely my best find of 2023; I'm calling it now and the year's not half over.  In the first photo, you see the new shade next to Excellence (which is on the left). In the second photo, the lineup from left to right is: Reflection, Smitten, Excellence, & then the new shade (I'm not sure at the time of posting this review what the shade name was will be).  Many thanks to Ami Cole for sending this beautiful product to me for review. I usually side-eye incentivized reviews, but like I said I've spent a lot of my own money (over $200) on multiples of each existing shade. It really is that good. And a major bonus is the opportunity to support a Black-owned brand that creates products with deeper skintones in mind."

They are extremely moisturizing and automatically elevates your lip and your whole face. Feels luxurious every time.  I cannot live without them and routinely will find up to 3 of these oils in my bag because I am constantly throwing them in there out of fear of going without. The oil is literally on my lip 24/7 and sometimes I’ll dab it on top of lipstick too. My favorite up to this point has been “excellence” (I’ve tried them all but bliss, which is on my list) however, this rose gold shimmer might take the #1 spot. On my lips it shows up as a lighter version of excellence. This color and the lip oil formula (in general) is absolute perfection and you need it now. 10/10 recommend. Thanks so much Ami Cole for continuously blessing us melanated gals."

As a result of going through so many of these lip oils, the company was generous enough to offer me a free one in this newest shade in exchange for my review.  This shade is really beautiful and looks pretty similar to Excellence on my lips. However, Excellence is more of a high shine/gloss finish, whereas this one has a subtle shimmer that reminds me of Ami Cole's highlighter. I will definitely restock when I run out!"

I turned my sister onto it, and she's not a makeup person. I'm on my 2nd one already, and I'm on my way to the store to stock up on more for us.

It looks like it would be flattering on many skin tones * Unscented  * Doe foot applicator   BUY, BUY, BUY 🛍️ or BYE-BYE 👋🏼?:  * BUY, BUY, BUY 🛍️  * I'll be picking up the other shade, Bliss, soon"
