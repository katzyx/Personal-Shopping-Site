It doesn't do anything a drug store oil can't do lol. $25 is insane for the amount - which i knew but I wanted to try it so I was willing to spend that. For a good smelling oil buy the JVN, for a really hydrating good quality oil get the Moroccan oil. this is an absolute pass!"

I have always been a type of person to use hair oils in my hair &scalp and I’ve tried different brands Across-the-board —-yet this has made a significant difference in my hair in the following ways: leaves my hair shiny not greasy. A little goes a long way. Smell is not overwhelming. Hydrates Hair. helps with frizziness. Important to note:  I have long, very thick wavy hair. This worked for me"

Most of the reviews I read said something along the lines of My hair felt greasy and weighted down so I was scared to try it bc my hair is color treated, so there's a lot of damage. After I washed my hair, and let it air dry, I applied some to my ends (I will say, the dropper is horrible. It takes forever to dispense the product) and they looked really greasy. I decided to let my hair sit for awhile, thinking it would absorb into my hair. The next morning, my hair felt absolutely AMAZING!!! It was so soft and silky, my hair had never felt that way before use. Definitely love!!!!"

I have long hair that goes to my hips and I only need two drops of this oil on each half when I’m using it as a leave in boost of nourishment.  If I’m wanting a deep conditioning treatment that I rinse out after several hours, I’ll use a full dropper of oil.  Despite having a rich consistency and containing honey as a key ingredient, it does not make my hair feel greasy or sticky.  If you have finer hair, I’d recommend starting out with a drop or two and working your way up if you feel that’s not enough to ensure your hair doesn’t get weighed down.  I love that it not only hydrates my hair, but it also freshens it with a subtle floral scent.

			"review_text": "The Gisou Honey Infused Hair Oil comes in a sleek, compact bottle that’s perfect for on-the-go use. The packaging is elegant and luxurious with a dropper design making it easier to control the amount of oil you use, preventing waste. The first thing you notice is the delightful honey scent. It’s sweet but not overpowering, giving a pleasant sensory experience without lingering too strongly. The oil itself has a light, silky texture. I have dry hair with some frizz, and this oil worked wonders. I used a few drops on damp hair after washing, focusing on the mid-lengths and ends. It spread easily and absorbed quickly, leaving my hair feeling soft and nourished without any greasy residue. For styling, I also used it on dry hair to tame flyaways and add shine. It worked well in small amounts, enhancing the overall smoothness and manageability of my hair. Given my dry and frizzy hair, the Gisou Honey Infused Hair Oil provided excellent hydration and frizz control. It made my curls more defined and added a healthy shine. Over several weeks of regular use, I noticed my hair becoming softer and more manageable. The oil seemed to improve the overall health of my hair, reducing split ends and breakage. It also helped maintain moisture, which is crucial for my dry hair type. Use it as a pre-shampoo treatment, leave-in conditioner, or styling aid. It’s versatile and works well in different roles. The Gisou Honey Infused Hair Oil Travel Size is a fantastic product for those with dry, frizzy hair looking for a lightweight, nourishing oil. Its pleasant scent, easy application, and noticeable long-term benefits make it worth considering."

My hair was soo soft and shiny! Not at all greasy, but the tiny amount is key. There is a really nice scent, a citrus floral with a touch of honey, but it’s very subtle and didn’t last in my hair."

I’ve tried a bunch of brand and the hype is typically all about the scent but the oil may not work for me. This is not that situation. I absolutely love this hair oil—it’s been over a decade since I found a hair oil that I really love and that works, isn’t too thick or heavy, isn’t greasy or doesn’t leave residue on clothes, etc. The scent is divine, but this oil also hydrates, adds shine, and keeps about frizzy ends. I like the dropper so I can customize how much product I need. I straighten my hair about once a week and this oil is perfect to add shine and hydrate the ends after using minimal heat. I love that this works for my hair when it’s curly and when I straighten it."

			"review_text": "For context I have fine hair that’s been dyed in the past few months so my ends tend to be a bit dry and in need of moisture. I received the Honey Infused Hair Oil today and my first impression is that I absolutely love it. The smell is slightly sweet but not overpowering, perfectly balanced, and the texture is nice and thick, just like honey but not sticky at all, and easy to work through my hair. Typically hair oil is meant for those prone to more dry than oily hair, but as someone who tends to have an oily scalp and dry ends this is an absolute blessing. I only used 3-4 drops and it was the perfect amount to moisturize my ends without being overly saturated. However, I’m sure those with thicker and more textured hair will also love this product as it’s deeply moisturizing. When I first applied the hair oil it immediately made my hair feel incredibly soft and 8-10 hours later my hair feels the exact same. This product made me want to keep running my fingers through my hair! If you’re someone with hair on the thinner side and have found other products make your hair and scalp weighed down by oil I would highly recommend giving the Honey Infused Hair Oil a try. This formula is so versatile and again, if you’re particularly sensitive to added fragrance this is a perfect choice for gentle and effective hair care. I can’t wait to see the results using this over a longer period but from the first time I applied this I was in love. This is the first product I’ve tried from Gisou and it left such a great impression that I definitely want to their other products in the future."

But my ends have felt a little dry and more tangly lately so I’ve tried this oil to see if it helps. It smells heavenly like honey, not too strong or perfumey. It’s neither too thick or too runny and feels good applying through my ends with my hands. My curls didn’t go limp or look oily afterwards either, just felt fresh after air drying. If you’re feeling like adding extra self care to your hair routine, this is a good choice and the bottle looks lovely on display too."

The oil feels lightweight and doesn’t make my hair greasy. It immediately increases shine and reduces frizz. It protects from humidity, which is a huge benefit for me. My hair feels softer, and the split ends look much better after using the oil. It is a very nourishing and luscious product.

And as for the smell I usually HATE any perfumes because they are too strong or too floral or just nasty but this smells great. I don’t think it smells like honey but it does smell like a honeysuckle (a flower). The fragrance is so light and wonderful. I will be purchasing the perfume with that scent. This is just my opinion.

It was the best, but it still wasn't good. This formula leaves my hair looking oily or damp. The bottle uses an eye-dropper which is virtually useless since the liquid is too thick to pull anything to speak of. Also, for some reason the bottle is always oily after using. Messy packaging and poor finished look. Hard pass."

For reference, it is hip-length, mostly fine wavy/curly but my grays are super wiry, coarse and kinky.  They stick out all over my head and it look terrible.   I don't know whether my hair is high or low porosity because nothing I've tried makes any difference (and I've tried EVERYTHING) to smooth out and moisturize it.  But anyway, Gisou hair oil actually does impart some shine and smoothness for me.  It's the only hair oil I've tried that doesn't immediately soak in and disappear, so I feel like it's actually doing something.  It is very heavy, so I wouldn't recommend for very fine or thin hair unless you use the tiniest amount and keep it far away from the roots.   For my dry unmanageable hair, it's great.  However, I HATE the dropper top.  It is sooooo messy.  Like other reviewers, no matter how careful I am, the product gets on the outside of the bottle and makes it slippery af.  8 feel like I'm wasting a lot of expensive product.   They need to rethink the packaging and switch to a closed pump bottle."

I made that mistake the first time and it made my roots look so greasy. Other than that, if u use it right it is incredible! 10/10, would recommend."
