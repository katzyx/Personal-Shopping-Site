On your lips it is VERY pigmented in the crevasses and dry parts of your lips if you‚Äôre a wrinkly lip person like me. But overall it‚Äôs a nice light formula and you don‚Äôt feel it at all. Maybe if i wasn‚Äôt so dark it would be better? For reference i am a medium dark Mexican girl  I know my best friend LOVESSSS this stuff. She is paler than a vampire though."

It's a little runny, so kind of hard to be precise, but luckily it's just a blush so it's not that deep. However, it's also a lip product, and it is not a good one. I like the tint it gives to the lips, but it tastes TERRIBLE. It's best to put it on a little on the inside of the lips for a subtle look. It also dries out your lips so hard but the tint spreads on chapstick/ lipglosses. No biggie but still."

I definitely prefer to apply it using a brush rather than a beauty blender or fingers. I put 2 dots on 1 cheek then blend with the brush and then repeat with the other side. you also must work fast because it's drippy and it's a stain so you don't want circles and lines going down your face because you didn't blend it in time. I also love using it as a lip tint too, it's amazing. this is my second bottle in 2 months (I got the smaller beginning of August and use it everyday for school). 10/10"

I usually blot off the excess lip balm then apply a little bit on my lips for that extra tint. I've used it on my cheeks before and I'm not a fan of it as blush but as a lip tint/lip stain- chef's kiss. Will 100% be buying again."
