My hair is generally quite healthy and free of split ends. and my hair doesn't fall out in clumps like that.  I'm thinking that The shampoo is the reason I had the hair fall.  The rest seemed to be all right and did its job.  I did have to add a leave-in conditioner because the concentrated conditioner really didn't cut it for my long lengths.  I'm glad I only got the trial size because I will not be repurchasing this."

I tried the mini starter set and I felt an instant refreshment to the scalp. I felt it cleansed the scalp, it lasted 3 days without the usual soreness that I get. The fermented serum was applied to my scalp but I don't feel it moisturized my hair; I had to use a leave-in to help me add some moisture and protection to the ends before a blowout. My hair is wavy with dry ends"

It's been a real struggle finding and trying products that never quite gave me all the results I was searching for. Then a friend recommended Rootist and I gave this kut a try. At first I thought it was just another flop but as I continued to use I started to see changes in my hair I never thought I'd ever see again. My hair is getting stronger with a lot less breakage and it's slowly coming back to life. I have hope again thanks to Rootist and this life changing hair kit of products. 1000% satisfied and recommended"

The pre-shampoo AHA effectively removed product buildup and helped with my psoriasis flakes. The serum further improved my scalp health.  Overall, I highly recommend the pre-shampoo and Biobrew serum out of all products included. The shampoo and conditioner were okay, but not the best fit for my hair."

A fast favorite for me was the pre-wash scalp treatment, it feels soooo good on the scalp and I felt really fresh after. The shampoo was nice and lathered a ton with the tiniest amount. The conditioner was just okay for me but I’m pretty picky with conditioners. The spray serum left my hair a little greasy on first use, but after getting used to it, I learned less is more and I only need a few sprays and it worked nicely! I’ll definitely get a large size of the scalp serum but I’m undecided on the rest!"

The Strengthen Concentrated Shampoo & Conditioner work wonders, even though you only need to use half the amount of regular products. They leave my hair frizz free, shiny, and much stronger. The Serum smooths out any remaining frizz and adds a gorgeous shine. Overall, this routine has transformed my hair from weak and damaged to healthy and vibrant.

It made my hair so soft, shiny and feel so healthy. The shampoo and conditioners are concentrates, so you need half as much product. The shampoo was ok and it still lathered as if I used a “normal” amount. I don’t think a conditioner concentrate is a good way to formulate since I go for quantity of product when I condition my hair to make sure all my strands are coated and this was hard with half the amount of usual product I’d use. Overall I wouldn’t purchase the S+C again, but the scalp serum is a winner!"

I wanted a more clarifying shampoo, but this caused irritation. The conditioner also made my hair feel brittle and heavy. The BioBrew caused flakes and irritation on the scalp, and brittle feeling on my ends. The pre-shampoo scalp treatment didn't feel like it did anything for my hair. I used everything for 3 weeks. My hair is long, fine, and thinning."

My hair is thin but I have a lot of it, and naively did not think that the shampoo conditioner would weight it down. It feels greasy right after it dries after using this. I like the spray, I cant say I noticed a huge difference. Wont use the shampoo conditioner again. The ACV treatment I think I liked, but followed it with the shampoo and conditioner so was distracted by the greasy feeling post shower. Wont be purchasing again sadly even though I was so excited!"

			"review_text": "I bought this kit as a way to try out as many products as possible by this new to Sephora brand.  First, price point is quite high for travel sized products.  I would say this should be more like $20-$25.  The shampoo and conditioner are just OK…did not feel concentrated and I had to use my usual amount of product.  Nothing to write home about.  The spray seems OK but again nothing I would run out and buy.  The winner product I would purchase is the AHA pre-shampoo scalp treatment.  It does last relatively long too as a sample product as you only use once or twice a week.  The last thing I will say is the shampoo and conditioner bottles are extremely hard to squeeze product out of.  Not sure if it’s just the mini sizes that have this issue or the larger ones as well."

			"review_text": "My goal this year is to take good care of my scalp so my hair grows thicker and fuller. I have thick wirey and porous strands but thin amount of hair. My scalp is extremely oily and my ends can look dry even if they are well cared for because of my wirey hair texture. This kit made my hair so weighed down and greasy. The spray, when used as recommended, made my clean hair blow dry to piecey oily mess even though I used a small amount. I used only the shampoo and conditioner next day and skipped the spray - hair was still greasy. Next few days I doubled cleansed with the shampoo, used small amount of conditioner, and no spray - hair looked decent but still weighed down.  No matter what method I tried, next day I’d wake up with the oiliest hair. I ended up using a clarifying shampoo to clean that oily mess out of my hair and went back to my regular hair products. My hair even seemed to have an increase in shedding while using these products which concerned me - but that usually happens when my hair is weighed down and oily."
