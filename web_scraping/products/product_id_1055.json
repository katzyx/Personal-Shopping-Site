			"review_text": "I wanted to use this product for a bit before I rate it fairly. I think this set is average. The contour stick would not roll up after 2 uses & I had to use a brush. Turns out it gets stuck. TBH I prefer the Rare Beauty contour stick in Happy Sol. The formula is top notch: it glides on the skin & blends beautifully. Not so with the Mario contour. The formula is just too stiff. I was excited to try the blush stick in Pale Petal. The color is gorgeous. I had to apply to my hand and apply to my cheeks. The color is gorgeous. I noticed I had this color already in my collection: Rare Beauty in Happy (mini). I will use these two products until they finish (panned) but I will not repurchase."
