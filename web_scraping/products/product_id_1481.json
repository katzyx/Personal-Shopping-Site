	"about": "Fragrance Family:Warm & Spicy.Scent Type:Warm & Sweet Gourmands.Key Notes:Pure Vanilla, Cotton Candy, Coconut Milk.Fragrance Description:Sandy toes, sweet treats, and smiles on the shore are brought to life with notes of sweet cotton candy, raspberry sorbet, and creamy coconut milk. Balanced by pure vanilla in the base, this scent is meant to inspire you to relive and recreate the memories of your youth with the power of fragrance.",
	"ingredients": "Organic Sugar Cane Alcohol Denat., Parfum/Fragrance, Aqua/Water/Eau...The list of ingredients is subject to change, please consult the packaging of the product purchased.",
	"how_to_use": "Suggested Usage:.-Fragrance is intensified by the warmth of your own body. Apply in the creases of your knees and elbows for a longer-lasting, stronger scent.&nbsp;.-After applying, avoid rubbing or dabbing skin. This breaks down the fragrance, causing it to wear off more quickly.&nbsp;.-If you prefer placing fragrance on your wrists, be sure to reapply after frequent handwashing, as this tends to rinse off the scent.&nbsp;.-Replace fragrance after 12 months. Expired perfumes more than a year old lose the integrity of the original scent... Eau de Toilette or Eau de Parfum?: .The difference lies in the volume of perfume oil. While EDT contains five to nine percent, EDP contains more, usually eight to 14 percent. EDPs, therefore, last longer and smell more intense...Recycling Instructions:.-The box, bottle, and cap are 100 percent recyclable. .-When the bottle is empty, remove the cap and pump, then wash thoroughly. .-Recycle the bottle and cap and place the pump in the trash..-The box is made of sustainable Forest Stewardship Council-certified paper; please place it in the recycling bin.",

I like how the top (idk if it‚Äôs designed like this intentionally) but you can do a normal spritz or if you hold it down it will spray for a few seconds. this is def a new favoriteüòâ"

But to be fair, cotton candy is only one of the notes so I shouldn‚Äôt have expected it to be a simple cotton candy smell. I hate to compare it to a rest stop bathroom air freshener but that‚Äôs honestly what it reminded me of for some reason - with a hint of cotton candy. Definitely worth a try because so many people love it and everyone‚Äôs body chemistry is different but maybe try it in store first instead of blind buying it like I did. The mist is phenomenal though lol if every spray nozzle could be like this, that would be great and bonus points for being clean beauty!"

The notes of cotton candy, vanilla, and coconut milk make this a delightful fresh scent. It is not overly sweet or overpowering, so it‚Äôs a great everyday scent. It reminds me of summertime and brings back memories of being on the boardwalk when I was younger. It has a very nostalgic scent. I love it! It also has great staying power. I spray it in the morning and it lasts all day. I also get so many compliments when I wear it. I also love how SKYLAR beauty is a cruelty free and clean fragrance brand. I am a huge fan of SKYLAR beauty and the scents and products they come out with. The scent Boardwalk Delight is no different. I find myself reaching for this scent everyday. I can‚Äôt wait to keep wearing it, especially with spring and summer coming. I highly recommend this Boardwalk Delight hair and body mist if you are looking for a fun and fresh scent!"

So, if you're into that, you would probably really enjoy this body and hair mist."
