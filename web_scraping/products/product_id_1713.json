	"ingredients": "Alcohol, Parfum/Fragrance, Aqua/Water/Eau, Benzyl Salicylate, Benzyl Alcohol, Linalool, Hydroxycitronellal, Limonene, Ethylhexyl Salicylate, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Coumarin, Citronellol, Methyl Anthranilate, Citral, Benzyl Benzoate, Geraniol, Ci 19140/Yellow 5.",
	"how_to_use": "Suggested Usage:.-Fragrance is intensified by the warmth of your own body. Apply in the creases of your knees and elbows for a longer-lasting, stronger scent.&nbsp;.-After applying, avoid rubbing or dabbing skin. This breaks down the fragrance, causing it to wear off more quickly.&nbsp;.-If you prefer placing fragrance on your wrists, be sure to reapply after frequent handwashing, as this tends to rinse off the scent.&nbsp;.-Replace fragrance after 12 months. Expired perfumes more than a year old lose the integrity of the original scent... Eau de Toilette or Eau de Parfum?: .The difference lies in the volume of perfume oil. While EDT contains five to nine percent, EDP contains more, usually eight to 14 percent. EDPs, therefore, last longer and smell more intense.",

But hello to this fragrance, when I first smelled it in the store, I'm like this is way better than the original one! It's so me. I love the notes on this. It's like you are going on a summer vacation by the beach. It smells tropical! I can smell creamy coconut, mango, vanilla and some floral! Buy it now! ‚ô°"

			"review_text": "I first smelt this in Sephora and didn't quite like it. Tried it again on another trip and fell in love. That's how it is sometimes. Its more spicy and tropical than regular flower bomb, I have every single flower bomb fragrance and this is my number 1 right now, well right after Bloom but seasonally this is def a great summer scent. It lasts long I took a 10 hour flight and came out still strongly smelling of it. If you're going to get it get the 98ml because I bought the 50ml not realising the bottle was that small. I thought it was 30ml when I opened the box because this bottle is smaller than the others. Worth getting the bigger bottle. You won't regret it especially if you like Flowerbomb. This scent isn't gourmand like Nectar or BonBon but definitely gives holiday in Hawaii or somewhere with salty seas. perfect for day or night time. Get it!"

However, like other reviews have said it doesn't seem to last more than 30 minutes on me which sucks because like I said, the scent is beyond gorgeous. I also spray pretty liberally (5-6 pumps all over) If they released this with higher longevity I would definitely buy again, but with the way it is now I won't unfortunately."

I am alternating with 3 other perfumes so that I don't go nose blind to it. The main reason I wear fragrance is so that I can enjoy it. If I wear it every day, I can no longer detect it all after a few weeks."

Definitely focuses on those middle and base notes of tiger lily abs mango with a faint hint of the coconut lasting.  Obviously comes in the signature grenade bottle with the V&R pull-pin. Definitely love the amber color in reference to the Tiger Lily as well as the mirrored label. So beautiful!"
