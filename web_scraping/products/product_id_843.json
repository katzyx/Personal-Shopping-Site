I have been getting breakouts since I started using this cleanser a few weeks ago, and it's definitely this. I've even gotten cheek pimples, which I never get. For reference, I am 38 with combination skin that sometimes struggles with hormonal acne, and seasonal dryness. Sad to say, but I can't recommend."

			"review_text": "My skin type is combination/ very sensitive with eczema and is often dry due to retinoid use. I was looking for a calming, soothing rich cleanser to use when my skin is stressed or dry. It has a lovely creamy texture that lathers without stripping and leaves my skin hydrated and residue free (I use it as my second cleanser step at night after an oil cleanse to remove sunblock and makeup), or on its own for a gentle morning cleanse. However, the one star off is for the fragrance: fragrance is stronger than I expected (I did notice fragrance at the end of the ingredients list but most KS products I’ve used have had minimal or no fragrance and most reviews indicated it was mild). The fragrance is very beachy and tropical - kind of a coconut vanilla that smells like cheap sunblock. It’s definitely noticeable and unfortunately happens to be a type of fragrance I really dislike.  Been using for about a week and my sensitive skin doesn’t love the fragrance. Giving it a few more days to adjust and if it doesn’t then I may have to return.  I would be extremely interested in a fragrance free option (would have received 5 stars except for fragrance) because besides the scent it’s exactly what I’m looking for as my skin gets more mature and dry. If you’re not sensitive to fragrance and you like the smell of fruity coconut sunblock this is an excellent gentle hydrating option. If you’re sensitive to fragrance or dislike vanilla/coconut type bath and body works smells give this one a pass or try a sample first."

Then I received some great advice. When your skin is like that you have to protect the moisture barrier and add moisture and use soothing products. Well… I bought this and stopped all other cleansers, toners, peels and it did the trick! My skin calmed down and cleared up! Love Kate’s products in general. I have already repurchased this cleanser.

I have tried popular cleansers that people would rave about but it was no match for my dry skin. It would always leave me with this squeaky,tight clean feeling. Sometimes it would leave me with flaky skin due to its strong cleansing agents. I purchased the Goat Milk cleanser hoping that it would repair my skin barrier. On the first use I was surprised at how supple it left my skin. It has this nice velvety texture that leaves the skin moisturized and hydrated. No tight skin feeling. No flaky skin. Just clean and moisturized skin. Most importantly it does not leave any redness on my skin! I have extremely sensitive skin which makes it hard to find a good cleanser that won’t irritate my skin. Once I switched to this cleanser I started to notice the redness disappear from my previous cleanser. I highly recommend this product if you suffer from very dry, sensitive skin! It’s worth every dollar!"

It was able to remove my Drunk Elephant cleansing balm, which is very thick, and it rinsed off super nicely. It created a super nice lather that was the perfect consistency. My skin had a glow to it and I felt zero tightness. More importantly, it didn’t leave behind any film or residue. I’m in love!  Normally I use the Indie Lee brightening cleanser, and this feels so much more gentle and luxurious while giving me a better clean feeling. I’m so excited to have found a new favorite!"

In the past, I have had trouble with tightness and irritation even with products specifically marketed for sensitive skin!  I have been using the Kate Somerville Goat Milk Moisturizing Cleanser for about two months now and found the product to live up to the claims of soothing sensitive skin and cleansing without tightness, dryness, or irritation.  As mentioned in the instructions, a small amount is enough to do the job (I'd say a bit larger than pea-sized) so the 4 oz. tube actually lasts quite a while even with twice daily use. This will be a definite repurchase for me!   I do find the that this cleanser alone does not remove all my eye makeup, but that is not a problem for me.  Although I wear makeup almost daily, I prefer to remove my makeup with an oil-based product and then cleanse my face before moving on to the rest of my skincare routine.    I did notice that the ingredients list did include Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Oil and Parfum/Fragrance, which I mention since they may be of concern for some users.  I personally have not experienced any additional breakouts - a possible concern with coconut oil. Despite the fragrance listing, I have not experienced any irritation or noticed a strong smell to the product.  I would say overall that the smell is fairly neutral."

If u got it like that where u can splurge on prestige cleansers then this one is a real treat. Using milk and honey on your face feels ethereal.  Hormonal cystic acne so this cleanser did nothinggg to eradicate that situation but it does make a cleanse feel like a pampering experience."

The significant scent of vanilla is ( to me ) non-irritating and pleasant, but might put off some people.   I’m pickier about cleansers than anything else in my entire beauty routine. My skin reacts to too-drying cleansers by overproducing oil and making me break out. On the other hand, while many oil and milky cleansers make my skin feel good, the lack of a deeper clean leaves my skin looking dull. This feels like a miracle. It emulsifies, not foams, on application, and feels so nurturing to the skin. After rinsing off, my skin feels clean and soft. Compared to other milk cleansers, this feels less greasy and more cleaning. The whole process is so enjoyable, I really look forward to doing my skincare routine.    Many scents give me a headache, allergic reactions, or skin inflammation. This is the rare instance of a scent that really improves the skincare experience. It smells sweet and light, and doesn’t trigger any sensitives for me."

You can definitely smell goat milk, not so much the manuka honey. I don’t use it daily, probably once or twice a week to mix it up from my regular morning/night time routine. It recommends massaging on your face for 30-seconds but I honestly take my time (about a minute) and it’s been fine. After using, my face doesn’t feel tight or dry, no redness either. It takes off the first layer of makeup, not so much around the eyes so definitely do a second cleanse after this!"

I was giggling with glee when I found this again, this past winter in a store.  If you have dry skin, this is the best of the best."

This cleanser is extremely gentle and basic, but smells like honey and feels luxuriously smooth on the skin. The cleanser forms a milky emulsion when mixed with water that rinses off well and leaves no residue. I prefer to use this in the morning when my skin is clean and I want a gentle cleanse that doesn't strip my skin of moisture. This is NOT a heavy duty makeup remover. I only ranked this 4/5 stars because I wish it was cheaper."

I purchase this particular face wash to try it since it has calming ingredients. I have acne prone skin sensitive skin and unfortunately this wash did not work for me. Yes it does smell so amazing, but throughout my 2 week of using it, I noticed  irritation and a bit clogging started to occur on my skin and began to get worse so I automatically stopped. This is my personal experience I had but I hope this review helps for some people!"

Right now I'm using Differin every night and I typically wake up to peeling skin that feels sunburnt. I use this every morning in the shower and it feels sooo good, it calms any redness I have too. I would say you have to rinse well with this, because it really sticks to the skin, but it doesn't feel like anything when I pat my skin dry. I haven't used this at night, so I can't really speak to it's makeup removal qualities but this will be my A.M. cleanser going forward for sure. Prior to this I was using Purity Made Simple for about a decade, but it was reformulated sometime last fall so this was released just in time!"
