I have been loyal to GHD but will not buy from them again if they don't stand behind their products. Too bad really b/c it's the best flatiron but not worth the trouble."

It heats up quickly and straightens my 2B/2C hair in less than 10 minutes, and my hair looks and feels healthy after using it.  Unfortunately, mine broke after only a few months. It has trouble turning on, staying on, and turning off. I don't know if I got a faulty product or if I did something, but I *was* careful with it. It's too late to return it now, and repairing it would be more expensive than just getting a new (albeit less expensive) hair iron. Considering how much this costs, I'd expect it to last at least two years, so it's a bummer that it's already not working correctly. It looks like the engineering may not be as sturdy as previous GHD irons, but YMMV."

I still need to learn how big it is, as I burnt my neck and ear once.. but I do that with every hair straightener! The heat is at an excellent level and it makes my hair look smooth and healthy. It is definitely worth splurging a bit to get a quality hair straightener that will not damage your hair."

I can let my hair air dry and then get amazing, frizz-free hair.  I also can’t believe how quickly I’m able to add waves to my hair.  As you can see in the photos, I used this to both smooth, straighten and curl my hair.   This heats up in 30 seconds.  It makes a nice noise when you turn it on and then another 30 seconds later. No more plugging in and going off to do something while the flat iron heats up.  When you turn it off, it makes another noise so you know it’s off.  I’ve heard others say they can curl their hair with a flat iron. Based on the curved edges and the design of the Chronos, I’m now using this in place of my curing iron as well."

			"review_text": "I received this hair straightener in exchange for my review. Let me start by explaining that I have literally straightened my hair several times a week for YEARS. YEARS! A good hair straightening tool is a necessity for my mature color treated hair that has become slightly more wavy as I have aged. This ghd Chronos is perfection in so many ways.  First, although it appears to be the same size as my previous straightener, its design makes it much easier and more comfortable to hold. Prior to taking the picture and comparing both tools, I was convinced that the Chronos had to be smaller because it felt so much more comfortable to hold and manage. Next, the first time trying the Chronos, I used it just as I have my prior straightener which required multiple passes on a section of hair in order to get it straight. Imagine my surprise when the Chronos not only straightened my section of hair in ONE pass, it also left my hair looking healthy and shiny. This tool has not only done a much better job than any straightener I have ever used in the past but it’s also done in fraction of the time!! The Chronos heats up quickly and doesn’t radiate the heat from the plates like others do. There is no hot smell of hair or need to select a temperature wondering whether or not it’s damaging your hair. The Chronos heats up and cools off quickly and has a cute chime that indicates it’s been turned on and off. This straightener is so good!!  I can’t ever imagine using any other straightener  again!! The Chronos hit it on so many levels!! If you want exceptional results in less time then look no further. You will LOVE this!"

It usually takes me forever to straighten my (long, curly, color treated) hair, but I was able to straighten my whole head significantly faster. It took less passes to get it straight unlike my old chi. This new straightener also doesn’t make my hair look dry or frazzled, it really helps smooth my hair out. The flashing light & safety feature are super useful & the sleek look wins points in my book."

It takes no time to straighten my hair and honestly has been a life saver. It’s very nice and sleek. I don’t like how you can’t control the heat setting though, I’ve afraid it will eventually damage my hair but I assume as long as I’m using heat protection it’ll be fine. Overall I don’t have any other dislikes about it and I think this is one of the best hair straighteners I’ve ever had. Also I love the fact it comes with a heat protection cover. This straightener is just amazing altogether."

The box is bright and elegant and when you open the box the flat iron looks stunning. Definitely my best looking flat iron. I have taken it on weekend trips and it was so easy to carry, super light and made my friends fall in love with it! I was able to straighten my hair really quickly without the hassle of having to go over it 20 times like other flat iron/straighteners. I love the way it glides on the hair and doesn’t cause it to dry out and how easy it is to hold without having your hand tire out. The last few years my hair has started to frizz a little especially after it rains and this flat iron takes care of that problem quickly, I am a fan of this flat iron and love how easy and quick it is to use! My friends love it and sometimes I leave it on my bathroom counter because it looks so nice! I would highly recommend this flat iron if you want something gorgeous that gets the trick done. Cannot wait to try using it to curl my hair as I have seen so many do! 100% would recommend this item to anyone!"

			"review_text": "I did NOT expect to return this!! It was a joy to use--but it FRIED my hair. Made it crispy. Dull. Dead flat straight (would not hold a curve or curl). Within just days of use, my hair was markedly damaged. It even smelled toasty (not in a good way) when I got it wet. I read the reviews... read the GHD info about their 'perfect' set temperature... let myself trust that a mere 5 degrees over my usual temperature wouldn't be significant--but whooboy, it WAS. My hair is not baby-fine (though not thick and wiry, either), nor is it especially fragile. But this thing was just TOO HOT. If I could have noodged it down in temperature, I'd surely be using it still, happily. Instead, to my surprise, after a spell of using it and cluing in it was making my hair worse and worse... I initiated a return. You know your hair. If you usually style with good results at a temperature lower than ghd's so-called perfect 365... then this is not the iron for you, no matter what their research says. On the other hand, if that set temperature is what usually works for your hair, then I can say it's a marvellous design, very comfortable, sleek, elegantly and intelligently designed. The lightening-fast heat up is a joy. It's a real shame they don't allow at least a small range of temperature control. For me it was truly a disaster."

I personally like one pass, but you can do two passes to get that sleek look.  The design of this flat iron is incredibly smart. The plates have a slight curve at the end and towards the top. This makes it easier for the plates to glide when doing curls. And let me tell you the curls stay all day. It also warms up incredibly fast. In about 10 seconds it’s ready to go.

The cord length is so long and rotations so your mobility while using the straightener is amazing! It also comes with a little silicone cover to cover the top of your straightener so that once it’s put away it doesn’t lay open like V. The only downside is that I wish it had more grip to hold onto it because it’s so smooth and can easily slip out of your hands if you aren’t gripping it. It comes with a little raised line on each side for grip, it would be perfect if they added for raised lines on each side! Also the Last straightener I used when I would hold it to actually flatten my hair. I would feel the heat come through the plastic and it would burn my hand in comparison this straightener when I hold it, it’s so thick and durable that it doesn’t burn my hand and I love that 🥰"

And the cord automatically curls with you so you’re not getting tangled up. I love the white color. It makes it look crisp sleek and clean. The packaging was amazing. And it just feels good in your hand. The only thing I would want for this is for a fast cool down. But given that you receive the silicone shield for it you really do not need to worry about that.

I wish the plates were a little longer but it leaves the hair very smooth and soft. This really does hold the style into the following day, which I’ve never had any other flatiron do. I don’t even need to go over it again the second day which really helps cut down on damage to hair. I’m truly amazed at how my hair holds the style after sleeping all night and looks like I just did it. That alone makes this Iron worth it. I usually just straighten my hair but I did put waves in it once and they held overnight too. I didn’t have any issues with the wishbone style hinge, it’s very easy to hold. Obviously the price is very expensive so that’s not great but if you can get it on sale, it’s highly worth it. I can’t attest to how long it lasts because I’ve only had it a couple weeks. I would hope it lasts a long time for that price. I’m really sold on this though and don’t regret buying it at all."

I usually have to set my flat iron on the highest temperature setting for it to be effective. As you can imagine I was hesitant about this flatiron as it has no temperature controls. Wow was I surprised! It's amazing! I like that it has an audible chime when you plug it in and when it finishes heating. It heats up very quickly.  It was easy to use and left my hair shiny, smooth, and healthy looking in appearance. It only took me 15 to 20 minutes to straighten my entire head. I love how perfect my hair turned out and will continue to use. Definitely recommend."

I was blown away by the styler reaching temperature almost instantly after turning it on in less than 10 seconds.  In terms of effectiveness, I still prefer my wet-to-dry straightener made by that other high-end brand that is only slightly more expensive than this one. I found that the Chronos doesn't produce the same sleekness for my hair. It's a serviceable second.  I love the white color and the silicone sleeve that comes with it.  I'd recommend this as a compact lightweight option for brand loyalists or anyone who has the budget, but I will likely use the wet-to-dry 9 out of 10 times."

I love the heat cover/protector it comes with, because I can store the iron right away without worry of burning or melting what I set it on. I would recommend this product! Only complaint is that there is no heat setting. The setting is meant to be the best heat for most hair, but mine is very fine and worry it’s too high for me.

Everything from the Chi of my teenage years to T3, Amika, and Dyson to name a few; but the thing that stands out the most about the new GHD Chronos Flat Iron is the fact that the one stroke styling is done at the optimum temperature for 365˚F. As in that’s the max temperature of this styler. You don’t even get the choice to change it to a higher temperature which is such a big deal for me.   I have coarse hair that can frizz easily but that holds style really well all the same. However, I have always cranked up the heat on my flat irons to max - even the Dyson Corrale has adjustable temperature setting. Despite all the heat protectant sprays, the too high temperature is truly horrid for your hair.   To be honest, this is the main reason I’ve been reaching for the GHD Chronos Flat Iron vs. the other flat irons that I own. All the other bells and whistles like super fast styling, ceramic floating plates, 10 seconds heating, etc. are just the cherry on top for me!"

I wanted to wait a while to use this flat iron a few times to observe the quality of my hair overtime, to provide a comprehensive review as this is not cheap, and for good reason.   Let me start by saying, the GHD Chronos Professional HD Motion Responsive Styler Flatirons are an absolute game-changer! From the moment I unboxed this sleek and stylish tool, I knew I was in for luxury experience. First off, the design is not only aesthetically pleasing but also incredibly functional. The motion-responsive technology makes styling my hair a breeze, allowing for seamless gliding without any snagging or pulling.  Now, let's talk results, my hair has never looked better! The GHD Chronos leaves my hair (and extensions) not only shiny but also incredibly healthy looking. I've noticed a significant difference in the overall texture and feel of my hair since using this flatiron. Plus, It doesn't damage my hair at all! Thanks to its advanced heat settings and ceramic plates, I can heat style my hair with confidence knowing that my hair is in good hands.  The ergonomic design of the GHD Chronos makes it comfortable to hold and maneuver, perfect for those long styling sessions. The heat up time is lightning fast, so I'm not left waiting around to achieve the perfect style. And the auto shut-off feature provides peace of mind, especially for those of us who are a bit forgetful at times or in a rush.   I can't recommend the GHD Chronos Professional HD Motion Responsive Styler Flatirons enough. Whether you're looking for a sleek, straight look or bouncy curls, this flatiron delivers stunning results every time. Highly recommend."

It made my hair sleek and shiny with just one pass on each section making getting ready easy and quick.  When I woke up the next morning, I was surprised at how smooth my hair remained.  The lighter weight made it easier to style as did the consistent 365 degree temperature.  After continuous use, my hair feels healthy with no heat damage.

(I didn't even have time to finish prepping my hair before it beeped at me!)  Things I disliked: *You can't adjust the temperature. I have thick, long hair and being able to set the flat irons at a higher temperature is essential to me. *The plates were much shorter in length than the Babyliss straightener I have been using, so I had to use much smaller sections of hair than normal. *Due to the shorter plates & lower temperature, it took a lot longer to straighten my hair than it normally does. Still only about a half hour, versus the 15-20 mins it usually takes me.  I can see this being great for a hair professional. The handle is comfortable and I can see them easily using it all day long. It heats up almost immediately, so there's no virtually no waiting for it to get hot. As for home use, if you have thinner or shorter hair, this might be amazing for you. But if you have thick or longer hair, I'd say choose an alternate brand."

A few seconds later it makes another little chime telling me that it’s already reached the heated temperature 365 degrees and the button is stays lighted up. It’s so fast!  I did try to stick to the “one pass” that ghd suggests, however I did notice that since I am in the process of growing out my grays, (officially 1 year down) those were kinda wonky up at the top of my head. I was able to do a quick 2nd pass on those and they were more manageable.   I’ve used this to straighten my hair a quite a few times, and to also add bouncy volume. I’m still practicing on adding tighter curls, as I’ve always used curling wands for that.   The one thing that I didn’t think that I was going to like, ended up being my favorite feature! I like that there is no temperature control, there is just the one button. This prevents me from turning the temperature up too high! I have been known to crank the temp all the way up to 425/450 on my past flat irons, risking the chance of damaging my hair. The ghd Chronos Styler is designed to prevent this.  This is a great hair tool and I’ve been raving about it to all of my friends and family!"

I can now straighten my hair in under ten minutes, curling and waving in about twenty minutes. I only need one styler when I travel now! The Chronos is a compact, high-quality styler that is surprisingly lightweight, making it comfortable to use. It has wide, smooth curved plates that heat up extremely fast, with a distinctive tone that signals it is ready to use. There are two lights on the device. One illuminates the on/off switch, and the other is on the end near the swivel plug. I appreciate its auto-shut-off feature, that eliminates the need to worry about leaving it plugged in after I leave my house."

As someone who has prone to frizz hair that is 34 inches long that’s a lot of frizz. I find myself struggling with both the top of the hair and the ends with seeing my thin hair frizz out. I love how this really smooths my hair. With just a little bit of oil as a heat protectant my hair was looking sleek and nice in seconds. And let’s talk about the wear time. My hair didn’t look frizzy the next day after sleeping on it. It maintained its style and looked really nice. This really cuts down on the time it takes prepping your hair because you can just brush it and now your second day hair is already looking amazing. For this long prone to tangle hair this kept my hair straight and smooth and not tangling at all. I found that after working magic on my strands that they didn’t twist together again so easily. Instead I was able to easily brush through my hair and have it look great. A tool I definitely recommend."

			"review_text": "I was so pleased to receive this styler for review. I had been using a Dyson Corrale iron for a couple of years as I had ditched the harsh hot tools due to excessive heat damage and split ends. Mostly, though, I was using a hair dryer or Air Wrap to style my hair due to their reduced heat (and thus damage!) to my fragile hair.   I have quite long hair that is oily at the scalp and dry/brittle at the ends. I’ve mitigated damage to my hair with products (shampoo, conditioner, balms, etc.), but I do need extra styling help as my hair has a bit of wave to it and goes quite frizzy/poofy if left to its own devices. Adding curls/waves to my hair can work with a lot of effort, but I generally default to getting my hair mostly straight with a bit of volume. Now that I’ve filled in my background, let’s get to the product at hand:  This styler is meant to straighten your hair quickly or to be used to curl hair to create lovely waves. It is shockingly lightweight (especially compared to the Dyson), but that’s a good thing and makes it much easier to maneuver or hold up for longer periods of time. My hair slides very easily between the plates and doesn’t snag or get stuck, which means that it passes through quickly and reduces the amount of time exposed to the intense heat. I hope this will, in turn, lead to reduce heat damage in the long run, but only time will tell.  What impressed me most about this device is how effective it is! One quick pass is enough to straighten my stubborn hair, whereas I needed 2-3 passes with my previous irons. I can do my whole head of hair (about 28 inches long) in less than five minutes, which is crucial when trying to get out the door in the morning. The other miracle is that, for some reason, my hair remains completely straight and frizz-free throughout the day. Humidity no longer seems to affect it! I don’t know why/how, but that’s worth its weight in gold to me."

Getting ready is enough of a headache, especially on busy mornings, without also having to figure out the proper temperature and ion settings or pressure needed to style rather than fry my hair.  Chronos' technology takes care of all of that. I just power on, style and go.    Given Chronos heats up nearly instantly, and will power down if it senses inactivity, it is super easy to start styling,  wrangle a kid/cat/more coffee then go right back to styling without worrying about a hot styler laying idle.  Oh, and it also comes with a high-quality silicone sleeve so storage is easy and safe. I also love the tapered ends of the styler - so much easier to grab hair not burn skin.  Thank you GHD for sending me this product for the opportunity to share my honest review."

It has two rapid-heating styling plates that contain ultra-gloss coating for a super smooth shine. With one pass it turns my wavy hair straight and silky, and the frizz is gone. I like that this styler has an internal heat temperature of 365 degrees, so there is no guessing what temperature to set it at. I also love how quickly it heats up, within seconds it is ready to use. It is effortless to use. With the ghd Chronos I was able to style my hair in half the time it normally takes me. It has one button. It powers on with a press of a button and plays a start-up tune. The lights will pulse while heating and turn solid when ready to be used. When you are ready to turn it off just press the power button again and it will play a shutdown tune. This styler comes with a heat-proof plate guard to use while it is cooling down. The styler fits comfortably in my hand and has an extra-long cord with a 360-degree swivel. This allows me to move the styler any way I need to without getting it twisted. One of my favorite features is that it has a safety shut-off. If the styler is not used for 10 minutes it will automatically shut down. I no longer have to worry whether I shut off my styler or not. I like that The rounded edges give me the freedom to keep my hair straight and shiny, or with a flip I can add some body and curls. After styling my hair I noticed that the shine and straightness lasted all night long as if I just did it. The ghd Chronos is incredible!"

This flat iron heats up super fast and maintains a consistent, damage-proof temperature, so you don't have to worry about accidentally burning your hair. The size of the flat iron is perfect - it's easy to handle and not too bulky. One of the standout features of this flat iron is the audible sound it makes when it's turned on, heating up, and turning off. It's a small detail, but it's a nice touch that lets you know exactly what's going on with your flat iron. Plus, the automatic shut-off feature means you can use it worry-free and not have to worry if you accidentally leave it on. Another great thing about the GHD flat iron is that it's versatile - you can use it to create straight, sleek styles or bouncy, voluminous curls. Speaking of curls, I was hesitant to try curling my hair with a flat iron because of the potential for heat damage, but I was pleasantly surprised with the GHD. By my second use, I was able to create curls that held for two days - without any damage to my hair. Finally, the flat iron's gentle shape makes it perfect for shaping up bangs or any other areas that need a little extra attention. Overall, I highly recommend the GHD flat iron if you're looking for a high-quality, versatile tool that can help you achieve a variety of styles without damaging your hair."

I absolutely love this hair straightener and the search for the perfect one is finally over. I have curly/wavy fine hair that is exceptionally frizzy when brushed out. Most hair straighteners tend to flatten my hair and I lose any and all body. My hair just looks limp and fried at the ends. But not this one. This straightener actually smooths my hair without burning it and without fraying the ends. The result is that my hair looks shiny, smooth, and has body. And the best part is, it actually lasts for a couple of days whereas other straighteners i have used left my hair so flat the following day I either had to wash it or put it up. It also heats up very quickly and one pass is literally all you need for super smooth, shiny hair. The only thing I don’t like is that I can’t get it to sit on my counter without flipping over. But it works so well that I can deal with it. I absolutely love this flat iron and highly recommend to anyone who is looking for the straightener that actually works without burning your hair and leaves it shiny and healthy."

I have very curly hair, it gets pretty straight with my blow dryer but it is still poofy and curly around my scalp. This styler straightens it right out. I usually only need one or two passes and it’s perfect. My hair is super shiny, I even received a compliment on my hair after using it.   The price tag is a little high, however it is worth every penny for the quality and for the results you get. My hair ends up feeling soft, shiny and the style lasts a long time.

Prior to this, u was using a one inch iron from around 2013. I never paid much attention to my hair, due to it having been bleached for years up until two months ago when my natural brown was long enough for me to chop it all off! One single swipe of this styler, and my hair looks like silk. It took only eight minutes to straighten my entire head. For a college student with very little time this is the perfect confidence booster, I very quickly am leaning towards getting a curling iron just to have a matcing set of such high quality in performance. It takes about one second as you swipe down and each section only took one pass over in the first photo. I did not do two pass overs until I got to curling my hair. As someone who has never curled her hair before this took makes it look like I have styling skills (but I don’t!) still, love the results and performance. There is a light that flashes on when communicating if it’s heating up, ready to use, or on!! It also has a safety feature to turn off after ten minutes.

I typically use straighteners to add curls to my hair and this one is perfect for doing that! I was able to easily create curls in my hair. The first time I used it the curls lasted all day, however the last couple of times the curls didn’t last as long.

Really impressive! When turning on, there is a small jingle like a magic wand. Its pretty nice and love the light on the outside so you can tell if you turned it on or off.  As for how fast it works... I normally have my hair 85% dry with hair dryer or comb out with a dyson brush. It would take my old straightener maybe 2-4 passes before its nice and smooth like how I like it. For this ghd chronos, 1 time is enough. Its like magic! 2 at most! So straightening my hair takes less time than normal. Love that it save me time and frustration.   Overall, I love it!!! If I had to buy it without trying, I would hesitate because it is $320 before tax. If you end up trying it, you would fall in love like I did. Lastly, it automatic shut off after 10 mins. This is big winner for me since I always worry of forgetting to turn it off after use. I had to have a smart plug on my old straightener in case. Now I dont have to worry!

After trying numerous options, this one truly stands out above the rest. The rapid heating time ensures I'm ready to style within seconds, and the intelligent design prevents any hair damage caused by tugging or getting caught under the plates. The curved plates not only make straightening effortless but also opens up the possibilities for creating curls and beachy waves. The versatility of this tool, acting as both a straightener and curling iron definitely justifies the slightly higher price point – it's a space-saving, dual-purpose tool that consistently delivers flawless results. In my opinion, the investment is absolutely worthwhile for the convenience and quality it brings to my daily styling routine."

It is lightweight, with a sleek  design and a swivel, no tangle cord. It heats up super fast and you can touch the end without heat protectant gloves. The plates are thin so you can pretty much start at the base root of your hair and not burn your scalp. My hair is fine and slightly frizzy from damage at all times. Even when I use my regular, high priced flat iron, my hair does not come out sleek or silky without using a ton of hair oil and conditioning type products. And literally within a couple hours the frizz starts to come back and my ends start to look dried out. It’s a vicious cycle. Well, I washed my hair with clarifying shampoo. I did not use any conditioner. I did not use any heat, protectant spray or any products in my hair. I let it air dry. I really wanted to see what this thing could do. Let me tell you, one pass over my hair, and my hair has never looked so soft, silky, and shiny in my life!! It glides over your hair like butter! One pass! No products!! I can’t believe it. I’m not gonna lie, my hair was silky and soft into the next day! It wouldn’t even hold a claw clip because it was so smooth! This flat iron is a bit pricey, but honestly, you get what you pay for!

			"review_text": "All my life I have struggled with extremely frizzy/wavy hair.  My normal routine is avoiding washing my hair at all costs for as long as I possibly can and being addicted to dry shampoo to calm the oils on my scalp. When I do decide to wash and condition my hair, it takes anywhere from 30 to 45 minutes to completely dry my hair and then another 30 minutes of heat styling whether that be using a curling iron, flat iron or heat brush. I normally turn my curling iron/flat iron up to the highest temperature setting possible in order to get my hair to respond and control the frizz. I wasn't happy about all of the heat I apply to my hair on a weekly basis so I was super excited to be chosen to test the GHD Kronos styler.  First, I love the fact that this styler heats up in under one minute! There is no heat adjustment on it, just a power button located below the heat plates. Upon plugging the styler in and pressing the power button you hear a short tune letting you know the styler is heating up. Once it's heated to the proper temperature of 365° it plays another short tune and is ready to use. I found it hard to believe it could heat up so quickly but once I tried it on my hair I was honestly in shock. This is truly a one pass styler. Whether you are going for stick straight hair or turn the styler 180° to create a subtle wave/curl it really does the job, and it does it well.    I styled my hair on a Monday morning by using the iron to create soft curls, and by Wednesday, my hair was STILL looking amazing.  After three days and sleeping on my curls.  Amazing! 100% recommend!"

You simply glide the straightener downward with a hair section and rotate the tool 180 degrees. My curls lasted all day! The next few days I have straightened my naturally wavy hair with this flat iron. It even did a wonderful job with those pesky gray coarse hairs growing in around my temple area. No trouble straightening those wiry hairs. There is no odor involved either. No smell of hair burning as with some other tools I’ve used in the past. Simple to turn off the styler as you then press and briefly hold the one and only button until it beeps. The light will turn off and that’s it.

I was pretty psyched to get the GHD flat iron, as I've owned exactly two flat irons -- a newer steam version I got as a gift that I don't like using and my good ole trustworthy Conair from 2001 which has seen some stuff.   The GHD feels incredibly high end from the initial unboxing. The swivel cord is great.  I love that it lights up on the inside and outside.  The chime when you turn it on (and off) is cute as well. This thing heats up insanely fast. Normally, I turn my Conair on, then section my hair, and then it's about ready to use.  This was hot and ready to go in literally seconds.  Also, the silicone protective sleeve for the iron is brilliant.  The only thing that took some getting used to was the wishbone hinge.   Did it hold up to the claims?  * lasts 24 hours - YES. I straightened it, and it lasted a few days. I then curled it with the flat iron, and it lasted a few days. * 1 pass straightening - NO.  HOWEVER, whereas I would normally do 4-5 passes on each section of hair, I was only doing 2, so I still call this a win.  On my daughter's 1C fine hair, it straightened in 1 pass without an issue.  * adds shine - YES. I didn't add my shine spray like I normally do, and I noticed a definite shine to my hair afterwards.  * lessens frizz - YES. Way less frizz, especially 24 hours later.... on a rainy day, nonetheless!"

I love this so much .. it doesn't pull out snag your hair and just is very nice quality and feels very sturdy!! yet I did read instructions and you need to be careful to not drop this at all.... they have electronics that could be damaged.. so I'd hide this from kids lol I love all of the features and the heat resistant cover is nice too!   my hair is shiny and tho I do use spray for heat protecting... it looks actually healthier than its looked all year!  I love this hot iron and highly recommend to everyone!!"

Unlike anything I've used before, it easily straightens my hair in one pass, leaving it super smooth and shiny. It is incredibly quick to heat up and I love the chime sound when it’s ready. It has allowed me to maintain the straightened look for days. This flat iron has become my go-to for achieving sleek, long-lasting results and if you are in the market for a new straightener that can do the work of multiple tools, this one is it."

You never really get that a more expensive product is expensive for a reason until you start buying higher end products. I like this better than my other higher end flat irons. I love that it has the curved edges that makes it easier to do waves and curls. I can’t get over how lightweight it is. That’s always my problem with different hair stylers whether it’s an iron, waver or dryer. Definitely recommend splurging on this one. Ghd has some amazing products and I always buy higher end hair products and beauty products. I received this straightener from Influenster and ghd in exchange for my honest review. I would have bought a higher end flat iron if one of my older higher end flat irons stopped working."

I am forever a convert to styling with a good quality flat iron like the GHD Chronos.  I find the Chronos to be aesthetically pleasing to me in sleek white.

The straightener I’ve been using for years (and like) is from Hot Tools. I love that straightener for its own reasons and I mention it here so you know what I’m comparing the GHD Chronos to. Here are the pros and cons of the GHD Chronos:  Pros: -One heat setting - fool proof so you don’t burn your hair -Auto shut off/sleep mode  -Less frizz in my hair -The off/on button is on the inside of the iron handle. Prevents accidental pressing while styling -One swipe over hair and it’s straight (or curled) -The outer casing doesn’t get hot -The cord is on a swivel - almost feels cordless -Iron makes a sound when it starts and when it’s ready -The heat distributes over the plates as you style your hair (very cool feature) -Comes with a silicone cover  Cons: -The plates are short (in comparison to my Hot Tools straightener) and cover less hair surface while curling -the clamp opening is pretty narrow. A little harder to use if you’re a beginner - just a learning curve though."

I have used multiple flat irons throughout the years, at every price point. This one takes the cake! It is small but mighty. It turns on by the click of the button and heats up to what your hair needs and nothing more. It makes a sound when you turn it on and makes another one when it is heated up, all in about 10 seconds. When you turn it off, it makes a sound to let you know it has been shut off. The light at the base flashes until it is all the way heated up. I have very frizzy wavy hair and I get a keratin treatment every six months to tame the frizz. One pass over my hair with this styler after I round brush it dry and it’s good to go, no more straightening over and over damaging hair. I do wish it was a little more smooth gliding over my strands but I tend to find the more I use a flat iron, the smoother it becomes and doesn’t catch hair. I would definitely recommend this product!"

I have tried so many other stylers and this is the best one I have ever used. I am in love with the results."

My hair looks much shinier after I use this tools. I love that it gives you a sound when the iron is ready for use. I also love the cute case to cover the plates. This is such a beautiful product.  I would recommend this to anyone wanting a flat iron that makes your hair look like silk."

			"review_text": "I received this product for free from GHD and influenster in exchange for an honest review.    I give the most honest reviews on my YouTube channel Give me the look.   It is a beautiful sleek design I like that it has a silicone cover so when you’re done or you want to put it down, you can use the cover so that you don’t burn your countertop or your hands after your done using it.   It has a very long cord which is super helpful. Most flat irons do not straighten my roots. This one did. So I was very impressed with it. I’m not really sure how to control the heat. I just turned it on and used it. But when I tried to straighten my roots when it was on, it didn’t work very well but then when I turned it off and it started to cool down, I tried to touch up my roots and it worked and they stayed straight. The pictures that you see are my hair three hours after I did it.  I blow dried my hair until it was dry and then I used the flat iron to straighten it and create a curl at the bottom which did not last 15 minutes. That’s not the products fault it’s my split ends.   Now, for a full honest review. This is my first time using the product. So I don’t know what the long-term use is going to be, if it’s gonna fry my hair, or if it’s going to work on wet to dry, or how long it’s gonna last before it loses his efficacy But my first impression is I like it. It got my roots straight which is a huge deal.  I had to pass the flat iron through a few times. It wasn’t a one stroke styling product. I think that would work, mostly for hair that is generally straight Or wavy. But if you have Dominican hair, thin fine curly hair or thick course hair, I don’t think one stroke is going to be enough.  when you turn it on and off it has like a cute little ringtone, and that just makes me happy., I like that the cord spins as you spin the curling iron, so it never gets twisted.  All in all I like it."

			"review_text": "I have a very old flat iron that I use from many years ago & it was time for a new one. Grateful that I was able to test this item out! I have very wavy hair & it drives me crazy. I often straighten my hair, so that it appears more organized. After testing the GHD flat iron, I was amazed at how advanced it is. It was so easy to use - you just plug it in & turn on the power button + in 20 seconds it is fully heated so you can use it. It is very time saving! My old flat iron takes a few minutes to turn hot. The GHD flat iron is also very compact (can take it on vacation), light (not heavy at all), and easy to use. I also like that there is an automatic sleep mode option (after 10 min of non-use). After testing this flat iron, my hair definitely was straightened faster & it did not burn my hair at all (and also did not have any burnt smell). I also like that they give you a cover to protect your flat iron. Great product so far! I have only used it to straighten my hair so I am unable to comment on curling."
