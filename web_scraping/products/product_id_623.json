The packaging feels super luxurious and the product feels the same. Unlike other plumping lip products that feel sticky and stingy, this is a very subtle change to make your lips look natural and smooth. I also found the formula very soft and easy to wear. This is not sticky and not too thick. I find myself reaching for this over any other lip gloss plumping or otherwise. The smell is also not offensive but very easy to tolerate and not strong. Overall an amazing buy but I don’t think I’d spend my money on them full price. Next year I’ll be buying them all on sale! lol if you can afford it you won’t be disappointed!"

Unlike others who leave me with a chemical burn around my lipline... this is a gentle tingle.  It's sheer in color, & I don't think the pictures are completely honest- I think you'd have to coat your lips 5x for that amount of color payoff... but if you're okay having a sheer colorwash of a beautiful brown gloss over a darker lipliner (I love the 1990's style), this is for you!   FYI, there is kinda a weird taste, like baby powder that I'm not a fan of... & it never goes away. But I can live with it because I love everything else. I wish high-end products didn't have fragrances put in... it just smells and tastes cheap & reminds me of Bonne Belle. Docking a star because the taste is gross."

When first applying, I did feel as if the glass was a bit tacky, however, it didn't end up being sticky, which I liked. The glass went on more sheer and didn't show much color. I did start to feel a slight tingle that you still get with lip plumpers, but it wasn't much and I personally enjoy my plumpers to have more of that tingle. However, it did feel moisturizing and I enjoyed how it left my lips feeling. On no makeup days, I would wear this plumper alone, with nothing else on, however, on makeup days, I would need to layer it with another lip product to provide more color. I am definitely going to continue to use this product, I'm not sure if I would repurchase though, as I do have other plumpers that I like better. I would definitely recommend to others to try, advising that it is an overall nice gloss and is moisturizing, but that they may or may not find that it plumps as much as they would want it to."

			"review_text": "This Gucci gloss lives up to its name, delivering a delightful plumping effect and a high-shine finish that lasts. Here's the lowdown:   Pros:  Visibly plumper lips: I noticed an immediate, subtle plumping effect that lasted for hours. My lips looked smoother and fuller, without any stinging or tingling sensation. Hydrating and nourishing: This gloss feels like a luxurious lip treatment. It's packed with hyaluronic acid and black rose oil, leaving my lips feeling soft and moisturized all day. Sheer, buildable color: I love the range of flattering shades, from soft pinks to nudes and berries. The color is sheer and buildable, perfect for a natural daytime look or a bolder evening glam. High-shine finish: Get ready to shine! This gloss delivers a dazzling, crystal-like shine that makes lips look instantly kissable. Chic packaging: The star-patterned tube and gold accents feel glamorous and luxurious. It's definitely a purse-worthy accessory.  Cons:  Pricey: Be prepared to splurge, as this gloss comes with a designer price tag. Sticky factor: The gloss can be a bit sticky initially, but it dries down fairly quickly to a comfortable wear.  Overall:   Despite the slight price tag, the Gucci plumping lip gloss is a splurge-worthy treat for your lips. It delivers on its promises of plumpness, hydration, and stunning shine, making it a luxurious addition to any makeup routine.   Rating: 4.5 out of 5 stars   I hope this short review helps you decide if this lip gloss is worth the hype!"

I have tried other glosses to give volume to your lips and the truth is that they feel quite itchy, but this lip only feels a little burning, leaving your lips with more volume.  I will give 4 ⭐ stars because I felt it a little sticky but not exaggerated, apart from this everything seems great to me.

No sugary cotton candy smells here, she is elegant and feminine.  I have fairly pigmented lips so Bertha Pink added a really nice shine and softness.  I found this be a very hydrating gloss and am really happy with the moisture it adds to my lips.  It has a nice texture, not too slippery or too sticky ( I do enjoy a slightly sticky gloss!).

			"review_text": "I'm a fan of almost everything about this Gucci Plumping Lip Gloss. Upon first opening, the lip gloss tube itself feels luxurious in the hands, it's plastic, but has such a smooth glass-like feel, & is somewhat weighted. The tube has a slick sort of slip, but isn't slippery, if that makes sense. The tube paired with the gold top that has small rigdes in it, makes it really fun to fiddle with every time I go to use it, also the entire thing is fingerprint resistant! I know I've said a lot about the component, but these are things I really appreciate about the product, & help make it a more luxurious experience, especially the fact that it's never smudgy looking from touching it. Now, onto the Plumping Lip Gloss itself. I really like this formula, I have tried quite a few glosses/plumping glosses & this one is lovely. The gloss is not sticky or stringy, but isn't too thin, & doesn't feel oily. It wears well & feels lightweight, almost a barely there sort of feeling, it's really lovely. The shade is a translucent, sort of milky pink tone, very much like the bunny tongue shade that was going around social media. The Plumping effects of this gloss are somewhat mild, as are most, but I love the feeling of this one, it's almost as if your lips are vibrating, it's hard to explain, it never gets to the point that it's too much, it doesn't sting, but you can definitely feel it, it's a very pleasant, enjoyable experience . The buzzing comes on slow & picks up for a bit before dissipating, then leaving you with a light minty kiss, it's just the right amount, & when you open & close your mouth, you get an extra kick of it each time. The one minor complaint I have is the rose scent of this gloss, while it is extremely tame, I would have preferred vanilla. I would recommend giving this a try, even if you aren't wild about plumping glosses,this one is just lovely & feels fantastic, it's actually a quality product, & that can be hard to find nowadays, even amongst luxury brands."

It smells and tastes like powdery bubblegum or something- I can’t quite put my finger on it. It tingles ever so slightly for about 5 seconds. I didn’t see any plumping effect at all. I do have pretty thin lips to begin with though so I t takes a lot to make my lips look plumped. I would have thought for the price and name brand this would be more spectacular than it is. The pink and gold tube is lovely and has some weight to it so it feels luxe. I do wear this gloss even though it wasn’t what I expected. It doesn’t last long and has to be reapplied a million times but who doesn’t love pulling this luxe tube out of their purse or pocket to reapply. It’s a whole vibe."

I do like lip gloss but really haven't tried a lip plumper before. It came in a cute and chic tubing. I wasn't that thrilled to get the pink color because that color doesn't look good on me. But with this you can't really see it. There is a tingle when first applying and then it fades away. I was nervous when I first got that feeling. Overall it was a new experience and I will have to see overtime if I want to continue using lip plumpers in the future."

I do believe it will last long without eating because it is moderately sticky. There is a very minimal scent to it. It's kind of a floral or maybe plastic smell. I wish it was something more pleasant like vanilla.  The wand is kind of thin and very wobbly. I worry that it'll snap off over time. I have medium sized lips and I did not have to redip for coverage. The pink shade is so sheer that it is virtually clear on my lips. There is a slight menthol tingle/burn. I don't see much difference in plumping. But I believe it probably does a little. Package is nice and heavy. Stars look slightly juvenile but I think it is very cute.

			"review_text": "Just because I was sent this for free in exchange for my review from Influenster doesn’t mean this actually sways my opinion. This is the only makeup product I’ve ever given 5 stars (and I’ve been doing this for almost four years)—but I’m not sure it’s worth the price tag. I know I wouldn’t have bought it on my own, but hopefully this will be helpful to someone else trying to decide. I was sent Suzane Brown, and I think calling it a brown is a little misleading. It seems more like a mauve to me, but I could compromise and call it a milk chocolate mauve. The color is very flattering, and I think would work for a wide range of skin tones. The texture is very pleasant: it’s gel-like so it’s slippy and grippy, meaning it’s slick on the lips without being sticky, and it also doesn’t slide outside lip lines. Plus, it’s kind of long lasting as far as lip glosses go. Although the color kinda of fades (because it’s sheer to start with), the shine and hydration of the gloss stay for literal hours (I’m talking like 6 hours). Since luxury brands are notorious for their fragranced cosmetics, and I’m sensitive to smells, I was fully prepared to not like the scent, but it’s more herbal than I was expecting, and I can’t really smell it after having applied it. It is a tingling lip gloss, though. It’s not as intense as a ducky drugstore brand—and if I lick my lips the sting doesn’t transfer. Since these plumping formulas mostly work by irritation, this doesn’t hurt me like most formulas, and my lips don’t look stung after wiping it off, either. The tingling felt more like  exceptionally tiny pinpricks that don’t hurt at all—this feels more like a minty sensation as opposed to a spicy pepper product, if that helps."

So Gucci claims this is visibly plumping lip gloss that delivers subtle color with glass-like shine and up to 24 hours of comforting hydration. I will agree that it is a visibly plumping gloss. It goes on very smoothly. The applicator is super nice and allows for exact lining of lips. The formula is a pretty thick consistency. You can feel slightly tingly sensation for a minute or two after applying. The Bertha pink is a pretty, slightly pink neutral that is really shiny. It does look beautiful by itself or over another color. I wouldn’t  agree with my lips feeling hydrated for 24 hours later. Once it wears off, my lips felt the same as before putting it on. I recommend if you are looking for a nice plumping gloss."

There is a bit of a tingle which is normal and manageable. On the downside- it doesnt smell great and is a bit tacky. Overall I am happy with it."

I really like the overall component of the lip gloss it is very luxurious, and the lip applicator helps you apply it perfectly to your lips. The formula is really smooth and sheer. It only adds a light wash of color to the lips (which is my preference when using a gloss). It goes on really easily and leaves a high gloss shine. The plumping effect isn't uncomfortable on the lips. It has a tinge of heat that helps plump the lips, and most importantly, it feels very hydrating. I would say that their description of plumping smoothing & moisturizing is very accurate. What more can I say - it's one of my new favorite glosses.  It's currently available in 6 shades that are suitable for a variety of skin tones. I personally think it's a beautiful luxurious product, and I can't wait to try more from Gucci Beauty. If you haven't tried it yet - you should."

It's even more beautiful than it looks! It isn't heavy in color at all and applies very light. Probably the most natural looking coral color I've ever tried. The reason I rated a star down is because of the smell. It has sort of a chemical smell to it and I just don't love that.

Starting with the pros: it feels smooth on the lips (not sticky at all); it’s moisturizing as it claims; the plumping effect feels cooling/mentholated as opposed to tingling/burning as with some lip glosses; and the shine is relatively long lasting on the lips (about 3 hours for me). For the cons: the applicator is smaller than I prefer as someone with larger lips so it takes a bit longer to apply; and this particular shade looks more like a clear gloss on me and I prefer more pigment to my glosses as I feel they liven up my face a bit more, especially on no makeup days which is typically most days for me. For me personally, most plumping glosses only give me a slight plumping effect as my lips are already on the larger side, and I’d say this gloss is in line with that. What I believe sets this gloss apart from other glosses is its moisturization and longevity. That said, I’m still not sure I’d purchase again at the price point since it isn’t as pigmented as I would like. If I did, it would be another shade to see if there’s a difference."

Personally I don’t like the feeling plumping lips give my lips and this Gucci lip gloss definitely doesn’t have that effect on the lips. I felt the slightest tingle so I would pick this over any plumping lip gloss any day! I would definitely purchase"

There was a time I got a bit on my skin beneath my lower lip and my skin turned very red; this doesn’t happen to me with Buxom or Too Faced. The color I have is Bertha Pink but when I wear it my lips become a red shade like I’ve eaten a spicy food. Overall I like the gloss, but I have to be careful to apply it directly on my lips and not overdraw. Sometimes I put a light layer of chapstick and then apply it over the top. Staying power is not veryyy long, so overall, idk if I would recommend paying $42 for this…"

The packaging is, of course, stunning, and the gloss itself feels nice on the lips. However, I couldn't ignore the fact that it caused an itching sensation every time I applied it. The plumping effect was subtle, and the color was beautiful, but the discomfort overshadowed the positive aspects for me. I'm not sure what ingredient may have caused this reaction, but it's something to be cautious about, especially for those with sensitive skin.

You can wear this as a topper or alone. I actually prefer it on its own since it’s adds a nice sheen to my natural lips. It has a slight rose scent to it and isn’t overly strong or sticky.

Besides the fact that the glass is really thick. You have to apply pretty often to get that plumping feeling and to maintain glossiness. I thought the packaging was pretty, but think this needs to be applied with another product to last."

One drawback of this gloss is the applicator, for who this brand is...Gucci should have put a little money into the packaging.

While the initial expectation of a noticeable pink tint might not materialize, it initiates a tingling sensation, gradually fading away, leaving behind a subtle change in lip fullness-an unexpected yet intriguing effect. This gloss excels in enhancing the natural lip color, evolving it into a mesmerizing pink/red hue. Its ability to accentuate the lips without overpowering them is commendable, offering a delicate and enchanting finish. The sensory experience is delightful; the fragrance and taste strike a perfect balance, avoiding any overwhelming sensation. Meanwhile, the gloss's luxurious thickness doesn't compromise comfort, providing a rich consistency that moisturizes the lips and lasts impressively long, sparing frequent reapplications. Undoubtedly, this lip gloss has earned a special place in my beauty routine. Although its price might not suit every budget, the exceptional quality and enduring comfort justify the investment. Consider it not just a lip product but an indispensable addition to any makeup collection, offering subtle enhancements and prolonged moisture for irresistible, beautiful lips.  I received this product for free from Influenster in exchange for my honest review."

I also really really hate the fact that I can't feel a tingling sensation, which I love about lip plumpers. Some say they feel the tingle, I feel nothing. Unfortunately that and the fact that this didn't plump my lips at all makes this a deal breaker for me.

It's a nice lip gloss, goes on very smooth, red color, not too sticky, and leaves lips feeling moisturized after the glossiness is gone.

The packaging is so pretty and really feels perfect for the holiday season. I will say it’s not really a pleasant scent though it’s mild and it is very tacky when you first put it on because the formula is quite thick. But once it’s on it will melt into your lips and after just a couple of minutes you can noticeably see your lips are plumper. There is no tingling or burning sensation either. I would definitely recommend this product and will be using it when I’m going out."

My lips felt plumped and hydrated for hours after applying the gloss, and I did not experience any dryness or irritation.

I took pictures of the shade in natural light and sunlight and for such a bright coral, it really does play well with my skin tone and is surprisingly versatile.

I received the color Bertha Pink which is perfect because I’m all about pink shades. This lip plumber has a sticky, slightly thick texture. It has a scent although I’m not sure how to describe it and I don't quite care for it. Infused with reflective polymers which smooth lips and add intense shine. I’ve found that 2 swipes give me a pretty high-shine finish and it does glide easily and smoothly. There’s a tingling that lasts for a bit although it’s not an intense sensation. I’ve worn it alone over my bare lips for a soft subtle tinted look and layered over lipstick for a full makeup look. It contains hyaluronic acid and black rose oil for long lasting hydration.  I didn’t find that to be true because after several hours it dried down and my lips went back to feeling and looking dry..It claims to have a botanical plumping agent that plumps lips by 22% but I saw no difference in my lips which was disappointing. Would I spend $42 for it? No, not based on the plumbing effect or should I say lack of. As a gloss I love it however I can find a good gloss for much less.

My first impression was that I really liked the color. I swatched it on my hand to begin with, and it’s a subtle swipe of color that goes well with my light, neutral skin tone.   When I put it on my lips, I thought it looked fine and had a nice texture but not much different than many other (and cheaper) things I already have. About 5 minutes after I applied it, my lips tingled, and not pleasantly. As time passed, they started to feel very uncomfortable, so I wiped it off about 10 minutes into wear. My lips definitely looked plumper, but I’m guessing that was more due to irritation than anything else.   So because of that, I put it away and waited a few days before trying it again. No. This stuff just flat-out hurts on my lips. Don't make me use it again because it's just too tingly. It's a shame because I like the color and even the initial texture, but that tingle is awful!!"

The clear gloss gives the lips an enhanced pink color and plumper effect. This gloss adds a ton of moisture to the lips !  Highly recommend trying out this gloss, it comes in a few different shades."

The tube itself looked chic from the golden top to the red and gold decorated tube. It literally won my heart off of esthetics alone. One I opened it I noticed the applicator was a bit slanted versus straight, which makes it easier to apply to your lips! The glide was smooth and the shine was EVERYTHING! I will say the tingling caught me off guard but it’s a plumping agent so some tingling is expected. It wasn’t too much. My lips are extremely sensitive so I don’t typically take chances with much but this was a really good experience and I’d definitely would recommend this product to enhance your full lip appeal and to liven up any occasion!"

As someone who's not typically a lip gloss enthusiast, I was pleasantly surprised by how much I loved this product. The applicator tip is small and precise, ideal for anyone who prefers a subtler lip gloss application. It's perfect for not overwhelming the lips while still giving that glamorous gloss effect.  The tingly sensation is just right – noticeable but not overpowering, adding to the plumping experience. Hours after application, my lips still felt moisturized and looked great. This is a rarity for me with lip glosses. You're definitely getting your money's worth here – the quality is top-notch.  I highly recommend this Gucci lip gloss, especially if you're looking for a product with a finer applicator that doesn't compromise on quality. It's become a go-to in my daily routine, turning a non-lip gloss person like me into a fan! BBB"

I got the color “Bertha Pink” which honestly looks almost clear with just the slightest hint of baby pink.  I wish I would have gotten the red/brown shade because I do like slightly more pigment with my lip products. For such a luxury product the wand SUCKS! I love me a nice thick fat applicator and this just feels cheap and flimsy unfortunately. I do however love the formula! She’s nice and thick which means it last longer on the lips 👄 if you like thicker formulas (I do) you will definitely like this. Depending on your sensitivity to “plumping” products this does have a mild cooling sensation with this gloss, it’s not too much but you can definitely feel the coolness on your lips for awhile. I think the “plumping” is from the thickness and shine of the product because I didn’t notice much plumping but my lips did look more juicy from the thickness and shine. For the price of the product I’d like a better applicator and this shade I received isn’t my favorite but I would consider trying out the other more pigmented color options. Overall I think it’s good, not great."

I got the Suzanne Brown shade, which looked a little scary in the tube (think chocolate pudding), but actually goes on as a nice sheer pinkish brownish shade. I’m fair skinned and I think it would work well for most. The formula is a bit odd. It’s smooth and not too sticky, but it doesn’t seem to glaze the whole lip evenly so there is some friction when you rub your lips together. The scent is what I’d describe as cough syrup meets air freshener, but it doesn’t linger. And you can definitely feel the burn of the cayenne pepper for a few minutes. However, the look is nice and shiny and plumping. Packaging is pretty, and tube is a generous size. I’d recommend that Gucci fine tune this a bit more, and then it could be a winner."

I would have preferred a fruity scent over the perfumy scent for my lips, but it disappeared after a bit. The gloss isn’t sticky for me, like I said it moisturized well compared to many glosses that just stick on your lips and feel gooey. This goes on smooth, and isn’t overkill on the gooey factor.

This lip gloss is unscented, which is a bonus for those who prefer products without fragrance. The application is smooth and effortless, providing a plumping effect that enhances the appearance of the lips.  The color Bertha Pink is stunning and adds a touch of femininity to any makeup look. However, it is important to note that the formula can be slightly drying. This may not be an issue for occasional use or for individuals with naturally well-hydrated lips. However, for those with drier lips or who prefer a more moisturizing product, this lip gloss may not be the ideal choice for everyday wear."

It’s just ever so slightly tinted and adds just a slight color to the lips. I actually wore it for the first time on Christmas Eve and loved it so much I wore it New Year’s Eve as well. I used it itself on Christmas Eve and didn’t really notice much of a plump but it gave me the prettiest shine and color. For New Year’s Eve, I added the Charlotte tilbury pillow talk underneath and topped it with this gloss. I loved it and got so many compliments. I’d say it’s slightly sticky but not bad compared to other glosses. It doesn’t plump the lips like my too faced plumping gloss does. Overall, it’s a beautiful gloss but if you’re looking for something to plump the lips, this probably isn’t the product for you."

Great formula I believe it will last me a long time not only that, but most importantly, the packaging and the inside component. They really worked hard on. It is a gorgeous tube of lipgloss I must say 10 out of 10 stars and I will be repurchasing !!!

The applicator is small and smooth. I did find I had to reapply throughout the day so not super long lasting as I would like, but the quality is top notch. Overall, this is a lovely weightless gloss that makes my lips instantly look fuller and smoother without drying them out. The packaging is gorgeous too with the gold starts and Gucci lettering.

The fact that it’s a glass component makes it instantly high quality, but i’d expect nothing less from Gucci. Now let’s get into the formula and the product itself. I love the texture of the product, it’s very thin though I wish they used a thicker formula. However I do love the skinny applicator, it makes applying it super fun! I do feel a cooling sensation about a minute after applying but it doesn’t last that long, and I honestly don’t mind it. The gloss doesn’t stay for 8 hours as the product claims, BUT it does a very good job at moisturizing and plumping the lips. About 30 mins after applying I noticed my lips were visibly plumper than before I applied the gloss. I love that this is both a plumper AND a moisturizer, not just a shiny gloss. I honestly would go out of my way to purchase this product if I hadn’t received it as a gift."

Gucci Beauty's Plumping Lip Gloss in 219 Bertha Pink is a luxurious and glamorous addition to any makeup collection. The packaging, true to the brand's style, is elegant and sophisticated, yet they added a touch of flair with the beautiful stars. The shade Bertha Pink is a delightful balance between subtle and vibrant, offering a flattering pink tint that complements various skin tones.  What sets this lip gloss apart is its plumping effect, which adds a touch of fullness to the lips without feeling overly intense, it isn’t a warming sensation, but almost cooling or minty. The formula is smooth, non-sticky, and provides a comfortable wear throughout the day. The gloss also boasts a pleasant scent, adding to the overall sensory experience.  While the price point reflects the high-end nature of the brand, the quality of the product justifies the investment for those seeking a combination of style, quality, and a hint of plumping magic in their lip gloss. Gucci Beauty's Plumping Lip Gloss in 219 Bertha Pink is a definite standout for those who appreciate both luxury and performance in their beauty products."

The cons- the smell, it was too strong and almost a perfume smell. I could also taste this smell when wearing it. Since it is a plumping gloss it did tingle my lips, it wasn’t painful but just annoying after awhile. Overall, it’s a good gloss and I will wear it when I go out.

The scent is what I really enjoyed, very faint, almost like a candy? Nothing like mint or cinnamon like similar lip plumpers. The typical tingle was very, very light which I liked very much. Although not feeling powerful, it left my lips very plump, rosy and soft. It lasted until I ate about an hour later.  I’m very pleasantly surprised by this Gucci lip plumper, the tube looks very cute, smells good, tingles lightly and it works. Love it!"

My lips were glossy without feeling overly sticky, and they were still glossy almost an hour later, even after I'd been sipping at my glass of water.   The box is very nice, but I don't love the bottle design. It seems a little juvenile/tween, and I'd prefer a Gucci product's packaging to look more luxe and classic."

			"review_text": "I had high expectations for this lip gloss. Between the brand, and the price point, I thought for sure this would be a 5-star product, but unfortunately that is not the case. First, the packaging looks nice initially; nothing fancy, though, just a standard lip gloss tube with gold cap, some gold stars, and gold writing. The gloss applicator is very small and very flimsy feeling; the doe foot bends a ton and feels like it will break off during application. The formula smells like wet baby powder and cheap perfume, and the taste is similar to when you spray perfume and accidentally breathe it into your mouth; it lingers for a long time, too. This gloss is thick and incredibly sticky/tacky feeling, and when you try to rub your lips together it pulls and drags. It is not at all hydrating; my lips felt dry and slightly chapped after the gloss wore off. The plumping is minor, you feel the slightest tingling after application, but it’s not even noticeable at all visually; no increased color or plumpness to the lips.  The pigmentation of the gloss is virtually nonexistent after application.  All that aside, my biggest problem is with whatever is in this that caused me to break out. This formula caused me to develop little whiteheads around my lips. This has never happened with any other gloss, plumping or otherwise, so I am not sure if it’s due to the plumping ingredients, fragrance ingredients, or something else they put in here.  In summary, this is the worst lip gloss I have ever tried. The packaging and applicator are similar, or possibly worse than, a dollar store lippie. The formula smells, tastes, and feels absolutely terrible. It’s not plumping or hydrating, and it caused me to have breakouts. For a brand like Gucci, and a lip product priced at a whopping $42, I expected WAY better. I wouldn’t recommend this to anyone."

The second thing I want to say is that the plumping factor of this gloss is so nice, its not stingy, and it doesn't burn. It tingles, but gives you the same effect as a nice plumped lip without the uncomfortable feeling that some plumping glosses give. The most important thing, its not sticky, its very lightweight, and its a very thin gloss. All those things tied together make for the perfect plumping gloss.

I thought the containers were a solid color, matching the corresponding shade, no it's just cheap lightweight clear plastic. Not heavy, not expensive feeling. The applicator/doe foot is very small, reminded me of little one you use as a tester at the store. The formula was just a clear gloss at best. I ordered the Fuschia shade, no pigment, no plumping.

This gloss is definitely sheer, with a thinner gel-like consistency (Think Buxom, but a little less thick/plush) It is slightly tacky, but nothing that gives that undesirable goopy, “stringy” effect on the lips. There is a definite tingle but it’s not a painful one by any means, although I still wouldn’t recommend wearing this if it’s freezing temperatures outside. It smooths out the lines on my lips nicely, and definitely gives a plumping effect to the lips. I cannot speak much on wear time as I admittedly wipe off all my lip products before eating or drinking anything 🫢  The biggest con to this gloss (for me) is the slightly perfume-y after taste (One of the things that often deters me from luxury-brand lip products) It’s not as prominent as some other products I have tried, but it’s very much there (Bear in mind I am extremely sensitive to fragrance/aroma in lip products)  Overall, I’m very happy and grateful to have received this as a complimentary product from Influenster & Gucci and will continue to use it. The packaging is beautiful as all Gucci products are, but  I would not run out and purchase this with my own money; It’s a very standard plumping gloss."
