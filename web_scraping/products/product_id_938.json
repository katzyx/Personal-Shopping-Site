It applied on very sheer so I was able to make the colour work, although it was way too bright compared to my complexion (fair-light olive).   The consistency is quite sticky. I recommend wearing your hair up if you decide to put this on. I do love how moisturizing and long-lasting it is. But again, that's probably due to the stickiness. It looked amazing, however.   I will be exchanging for the clear gloss."

There was once a lip mask sold by Avon that acted as a chemical exfoliator and when you wiped it off, all the dead skin on your lips came off with it. I don't think that was what this was supposed to do, but it did. And weirdly I am not mad at it. Lips are soft now so...cool."

Even through drinking, sure some comes off each time, but I find I still have some there after several unintended blots on the glass or straw. However, I have bought two now and both are awesome in this way, but only one is awesome all around; the other has a downside.  Marshmallow Electro has a light scent that’s actually pretty and enjoyable, like a mild vanilla-ish smell. Love it!  But Tickled Pink I bought recently for more color and it sure is pretty too, and has a light-medium sheerness I suppose. And, when you open it and first apply it, it has a wonderful fruity smell. However, within a few minutes this changed and smelled/tasted yucky!! Almost like a fake and chemically smell/taste that seeps in, to where it’s nauseating and I had to wipe it off within 15 mins. Hopefully it’s just a bad tube, cuz the ME color I have is is not like that at all. I’ll return Tickled Pink and try another, as I do love how they stick around for a while and feel."

I bought the shade “marshmallow electro” and I was NOT disappointed! The formula wasn’t at all sticky, despite what others had said. The glitter is SO perfect for me! I don’t wear heavy makeup any longer so I usually stick to no makeup besides filling in my brows and lash extensions, but I LOVE a glossy lip! This is the best addition to my lippie collection!

			"review_text": "So a friend got me a set of Juicy Tubes for my birthday, and I'm going to review this shade because it was by far my favorite shade in the set. I haven't used Juicy Tubes lip gloss since middle school, so it was kind of nostalgic to see the iconic plastic tube again!  Since the shade Magic Spell looks really pink in the tube, I was scared that it would be a really childish color on my lips, but when I applied it, it actually just provided a subtle, soft pink tint on my lips! There's a sheer glitter in it, which is really nice when the light hits it.   Another thing that's really nice about this lip gloss is that it's not heavy or sticky - it's fairly lightweight and my lips don't feel gross when I apply it. It's not as lightweight as my favorite lip gloss (Glossier's lip gloss), but it's pretty darn close.  Also, $20 may seem expensive for a lip gloss, but each tube is 0.5 oz., which is a lot more than most other lip glosses will give you. Glossier charges $14 for just 0.14 oz. of lip gloss, so this Lancome lip gloss is actually only a bit more expensive than Glossier's lip gloss with over three times the product. That's a really good value!   I kind of wish that Lancome would update its lip gloss packaging to look more aesthetically pleasing, but there is something to be said about the feeling of nostalgia that this product's packaging fosters.   Overall, I think that this is a great lip gloss! I didn't have super high expectations before trying this product again after a lot of years, since I really didn't trust my makeup taste in middle school, but this product definitely exceeded my expectations by a lot! I'd literally still wear this lip gloss; it's not just a little kid lip gloss, even though a lot of us did use it when we were little kids. I personally still like Glossier's lip gloss better, but this is definitely a better value and there are so many different shades!"

My only complaint is about the packaging. It’s Lancôme, shouldn’t it be a little fancier? It reminds me of a lip gloss tube you could get at Claire’s. The formula doesn’t reflect cheapness at all, but it’s just my opinion on packaging. However, I think it’s a good deal since packaging usually increases the price of makeup. I highly recommend if you want a luxury good with some magic!"

The scent and formula brought me right back to high school circa 2002 ;) I thought they might have changed the formula (maybe they have a little?) but it smelled and felt pretty much the same -- which is OK, but they are VERY sticky/tacky and thick.  Still love it, though. Took off one star because the tackiness does get a little annoying. Color payoff is also pretty minimal, but I feel like that is to be expected in a lip gloss.  They all look very similar on, I think."

			"review_text": "I’m not somebody who is really picky with glosses, but the other reviews for this product have been confusing to me, and I do have some personal problems with this gloss, so I thought I would give my 2 cents lol First off, I would not describe this gloss as sticky whatsoever. This seems to be an issue with some people, others don’t mind it. Thicker, sticky glosses typically wear longer throughout the day, so I prefer them. This gloss feels more like an oil to me, which I do not like. It’s very thin on the lips, and it does not wear very long at all. I feel like I have to keep applying it to have any shine. Second, the glitter is DEFINITELY gritty. Again, this isn’t something bothers me all the time. But the problem I have with this glitter is it is very gritty, but it doesn’t look like it applies. So you feel the glitter, but you can’t really see it. So again, I feel like I have to keep applying it or use a lot of product at once. It’s essentially just a clear gloss with grit. Last, the color is misleading online. Like others have said about Birthday Confetti, they describe it as sheer pink and show it as a sheer pink, but it’s clear in real life. There is no pink in the gloss whatsoever. I was excited when my store finally got these in. They only received one and I purchased it, and I was very disappointed. I’m not sure how the other shades look or feel. I’m sure the glosses without glitter are better on the lips, but this one was a letdown."

The thing that turns me off the most is the odd taste and texture it has. Naturally, you lick your lips and gloss travels into your mouth. When it does, it is just an odd unpleasant experience. The thickness remains and it just kind of lingers on your tongue for a while. Other glosses do not do this. You just ingest it, and it is like it never happened."

I’m currently on accutane and while other glosses sounds keep my lips comfortable, the heavier “sticky” texture actually works best at locking in moisture, even when wearing a mask or in central A/C. I typically only have to reapply once or twice a day after meals. This works way better than the petroleum jelly derms recommend to protect your lips. I got a sample size of this in the Discovery set and was astounded to find it became my new “old” favorite. I definitely had one of these back in my teen years and the formula has improved since then — the balance is way better so the gloss isn’t as sticky, though it’s heavier than other contemporary products.  If you don’t want a shimmer or colored gloss, I think going for the clear is a solid option for phenomenal dry lip protection. I’ll be repurchasing as long as I’m on accutane."

What perhaps is more accurate is saying that this gloss is tacky. It does *not* pull those weird gross stringy strands at the ends of your lips like I imagine when someone tells me that a lipgloss is “sticky”. This isn’t that. It feels and wears like a high-end lip gloss. Comparisons to drugstore lipglosses in some reviews I find wild! And not in a good way. Buy the gloss, they fly off the shelves in my Sephora store. Juicy tubes are a rich gloss that hugs your coats your lips evenly, and lasts quite a bit longer than other glosses because of its trademark texture. The actual colours are fairly transparent so keep that in mind when you build your expectations. They also don’t really have a specific smell to me, they just smell kinda sweet. But not like a headache inducing-I’m-using-my-4-year-old’s-cheap-gloss kinda way. If you love the look of the rich glossy 90’s lip trend then you will adore these."

The original was more neutral and sophisticated, now it’s far too “rosey” for me (I’m not a pink gal... it makes me look like a child)  Please bring back the OG Tickled Pink Lancôme!

I've noticed that many lipsticks and glosses have this scent lately.  I'm sensitive to scent, especially synthetic fragrance and this one gives me a headache and bit of nausea.

Fast forward about a month and I pick it up to use and it smells completely different. Like straight up chemicals, and has a very chemically bitter taste and looks less pink in the tube. I ended up throwing something I used twice in the trash which sucks. The same thing happened with the birthday one. It smells better, guess they all have different scents, and the glitter is really pretty. But when you open the box it has a pinky tinge to it in the tube and in one month it has become clear and smells different. Why are they deteriorating so rapidly? Btw the doors always open so it’s not like my bathroom stays humid and there is no window for sunlight to ruin them. They’re kept in a covered tray anyways. Such a waste of $40."

Also it came WITH A LOT of bubbles in it, not the best look and seems slightly like wasted space for $20  pictured below is the old one on the left and new one on the right."

The smell reminded me of watermelon, which is fine, but the taste was terrible. I don't even know how to describe it, but I had to take it off. The gloss is also extremely sheer. My old favorite color used to have a lot more payoff and would even leave a subtle stain when the gloss wore off. I still really liked the texture (I find it more cushiony than sticky), but I had to send mine back."

You really can’t go wrong with Birthday Party & Hallucination as they were both in the nude family, with the latter having a bit more purple tint to it. Second, I did have a bit of trouble with the application because a slight squeeze goes a very, VERY long way. I had to get used to this because I’m used to having to really apply pressure to get products in similar packaging to come out. Next, it does compare similarly to other lip glosses in this style. These are, however, definitely‘juicier’. Also, they do moisturize your lips nicely! I would surely recommend them to anyone looking for a fun, shiny, somewhat glittery gloss for summer. Finally, overall, I really enjoyed these Juicy Tubes, but if you have long hair like me, you might wanna wear it in a ponytail because my hair was constantly stuck to my lips! LOL I received these products complimentary from BzzAgent in exchange for my honest review!"

It is comparable to lip glosses I've gotten at Victoria's Secret for a much lower price.  I like the flavors of the VS ones better though, because I can actually taste them. I recommend this if you don't like to actually taste your lipgloss. It does help moisturize the lips as well. I don't think I will buy it again when I run out, but it was good to try it this time. I tried this one and hallucination. Both are sheer and do look nice on.  I recieved these free to review.  I like keeping gloss in my purse during summer because they don't get too melty and make a huge mess like some balms do if I leave it in my car.  I did notice there was some separation of the product though when I had recieved it and wasn't sure if it was associated with heat. It is too thick for it to mix together if I shake it.  That kind  of turned me off especially with a $20 price point.  It was just some clear liquid at the end of the tube furthest from the opening and I don't think it effected the actual product, but I haven't tried this brand before so it could have.  It is a nice gloss but didn't seem all that special too me."

It gave my lips a weird brownish tint that I wasn’t Vibin with. I much prefer Birthday Confetti to layer over lipstick or wear alone.

It feels great on!! Nice and smooth! It doesn't dry out your lips, and I find myself using even less chapstick since I've been using this!!  I wear this mostly alone, but have put it on top of lipstick, as well!"

I would say that they lasted probably half a day for me, which isn't bad as I drink a lot and they were very moisturizing on my lips.  This one was definitely glittery, which I like, but that's really personal preference.  I didn't mind the smell or the flavor, but again that's down to personal preference.

I would definitely recommend this product to a friend. I would like to try some darker colors with more pigment. I am very curious to see the color pay off.

I can't believe I actually used to put up with slathering on and layer upon layer of that gooey, sticky horrible tasting formula just to get my pout to look wet and luscious!  Those lip gloss were always so thick, gooey and super sticky. Which I thought was going to be the same thing with these. However, I will say with the Lancome Juicy Tube's not only do they look beautiful they really are a pleasure to wear. They DO NOT go on gooey as you apply the pressure when squeezing the tube, and they don't feel sticky at all! Nor do you need layer upon layer of to achieve that look! I really enjoy the Shimmer in this lip gloss. It gives you just the right amount of Sparkle. Leaving your lips looking full wet and absolutely beautiful, about all the dreaded goofiness and stickiness that went along with the old 90s version lip gloss! I enjoyed both Shades as one is just a slight difference in color really not anything super pigmented however it does leave a wash of color. Out of the two colors I've tried, I'm partial to Birthday Confetti. Only because I tend to lean more towards pinky colors. Hallucination is nice as well. A very slight wash of Peachiness. Both give you just the right wash of color and perfect amount of shine! In my mind this product might be a Throwbacks from the late 80's or 90's but I like them just the same!"

You do need to reapply after drinking, but that is pretty normal with gloss. I can't wait to try other colors!"

They come in a  0.5 fl oz squeeze tube and an array of colors.  I received the Lancôme Juicy Tubes in the colors 09 Hallucination and 20 Birthday Confetti, to try out.  When you apply them, the base color shown in the tube is not really noticable at all. The formula feels like a thick lip balm, and not sticky at all. The glitter doesn't feel gritty and adds a subtle shimmer, that catches the light nicely.  Hallucination is a light beige color with micro gold glitter and has a sweet light vanilla scent and taste.    Birthday Confetti is a pale pink color with iridescent glitter. I must have received a bad tube of this one or something, because it smells like chemicals and tastes even worse.  Overall, I am not too impressed with this product. It does not perform any different then less costly and comparable products from other brands. In fact I have drugstore glosses that I prefer more. Although the packaging is iconic, it feels cheap. These are the reasons I only am giving this product only 3 stars."

However, the more I wore Hallucination, the more the nude color grew on me. I like it because it provides hours of long-lasting moisturization. It literally makes your lips feel juicy.   Now Birthday Confetti was a different story for me. It offers a transparent sheen across the lips with a faint sparkle effect. There are tiny particles of sparkle, and I can feel them on my lips. I don't like the way this formula feels, and it just doesn't seem as juicy as Hallucination.    I feel like the Juicy product line provides an ultra-hydrating lip experience that I'd recommend to family and friends. Depending on which tint you get, the product also creates a fresh, understated look for the lips.   I would purchase a Lancome Juicy Tube in the future, but for me, I'd prefer a shade that offered a little more lip color, like their Magic Spell, but Hallucination is a decent, non-distracting shiny choice I wouldn't mind having again."

I can't honestly recall whether I wore Juicy Tubes in the aughts - as a student, probably not - my budget was more drugstore then, so I can't comment on whether the formula has changed since returning. It's great now though.  Both of the colors I acquired are light; Birthday Confetti is a lovely sparkly baby pink - it's not glittery enough to be an evening shade, but the particles are large enough that you can feel them when you rub your lips together - it's a weird combo. Hallucination is a frosty nude - hearkening back to the 90s. The color is not opaque, but it's enough not to work with my skin; I have a friend with a more olive complexion that this color looks great on. Overall, the juicy tubes have an easy application process, spread nicely, and feel great on my lips. It's not a long-wear product, but due to the easy application, I have no fear of reapplying without a mirror. Definitely worth checking out :)  *I removed a star because Birthday Confetti smells like coconut, which I hate. Not enough to avoid wearing mind you, so if the other colors are scented differently, I'll return that"

Both are extremely thick and I didn't remember the ones back in the day being quite as...for lack of a better term.....gloppy.  But that also translated to them being quite long lasting for a lip gloss, which I love.  Neither of the shades I got thrilled me, especially the Birthday confetti since I'm not that into glitter/sparkles, but I would definitely love to try a few of the other shades.  I've gotten used to always using Buxom lip glosses, which are also a bit thick, but nowhere near as much as the Juicy Tubes and have quite a bit more slip.

The Lancome Juicy Tubes Moisturize your lips. Other Products of similar quality wear off too soon. The Lancome Juicy Tubes stay for awhile before needing reapplied. I would and have bought this product since receiving the free samples from BZZAGENT. I would and have recommended these to family and friends."

It’s consistency is thicker than most, which I personally prefer, but not too sticky and thick. It stays on longer, so that I don’t  have to constantly apply it. One tube will last a very long time, unlike many lipglosses that I’ve used. If you prefer a thin lipgloss, this may not be for you. I love the shine and hint of shimmer that it gives! I don’t typically wear lipstick, because my lips dry out so fast. I have always preferred and worn lipglosses that keep my lips moisturized and Juicy Tubes does a great job at this. I will definitley continue to use and purchase this product and highly recommend to friends and family. Thank you so much for giving me the opportunity to try this. Now I can purchase this product, knowing that I will be happy and not have wasted my money!"

It is not sticky or tacky feeling. Your lips feel really hydrated and soft.  The colors look darker in the tube than how they appear on the lips. I have attached a picture of the colors on my hand.  The hallucination is more of a natural color and the birthday confetti is more of a shimmer/glitter look. Again both beautiful.  I have used tons of lip gloss brands and this is my favorite because of all the above mentions. If you use this your lips will always be super soft.

Neither are colors that I would normally pick out because I prefer reds and purples.  Both colors are sheer with very little color payoff; they basically just give you a pop of shimmer if you want to go for a natural look or you could use them to liven up your lipstick color."

I tried the Birthday Confetti and Hallucination colors. Confetti has bright glitter sparkles and a delightful vanilla smell. It doesn't add any color to my lips to speak of, but you can see the glitter faintly. Hallucination gave my lips a faint blush color which I liked more.

A little tube that fits in a purse, pocket, bag or wherever you need it. The screw cap ensures the product doesn't ooze out inside of your expensive purse. You squeeze the product out of a slanted top, making application easy and mess free.  I'm specifically reviewing 2 colors. Birthday Cake (20) and Hallucination (09). Both are great to wear on their own as they really have an amazing, light catching shimmer. They are perfect for no makeup- makeup days. Both apply super easy and glide over the lips. Hallucination is a bit thicker than Birthday Cake, but neither are super sticky or tacky. I have also layered both tubes over every color immanagible (or at least in my collection). I'm totally obsessed with how these take a flat lip color to a whole other level! Birthday Cake has gorgeous metallic flecks that pick up and reflect light for a drop dead gorgeous look. Hallucination has more gold and earth tones that are simply stunning.  Birthday Cake smells delicious, like a vanilla cupcake, but it is not overpowering. Hallunication has more of a candy/bubble gum scent. After a moment on the lips, you get a wonderful, clean, Lancome skincare scent. I absolutely love them!  They feel great on the lips. The Lancome Juicy Tubes are in a very small group that have glitter/shimmer but don't feel rough on the lips. If you love glitter, but really hate the rough feeling they leave, then these are for you! They also keep my lips incredibly moisturized and smooth!  I'll also note that, even though these aren't lip plumping products, the way they sit on the lips does make them appear bigger. They also aren't overly sticky where your constantly pulling hair off of your lips!  I totally understand why Lancome chose to name these Juicy Tubes! They really make your lips look juicy and delicious!  I have purchased them in the past, and will continue to buy them!"

The glosses work really well they work like a gloss should I think that since lancome redid the packaging they should've made it look more adult one that comes with a wand in my opinion lip gloss that comes in tubes seem childish and its easier to apply gloss with a wand."

I am in love with how it looks on my skin tone. Also, these juicy tubes are scented and this one smells dreamy. My lips are usually very dry and at times crack in the colder months, with using Juicy tubes the dryness has improved. I prefer to wear alone as a gloss for a more natural highlighted lip look I highly recommend Lancome juicy tubes in the shade hallucination"

I had stopped using lip gloss due to the taste and smell, but these juicy tubes smell great and have no nasty taste if you like your lips.  Juicy tubes are the best lip gloss I have ever used and I do not have to keep reapplying as often as others I have used.  I add it over top of my favorite lipstick and I also wear it alone.  I have tried birthday confetti and hallucinations shades and cannot wait to buy more in different colors.  I never leave home without it and would highly recommend it.  The only reason I did not give it a 5 star is that it is a little pricey."

What I like most is that it doesn’t leave your lips feeling sticky like other lipglosses I’ve tried have. The tapered end makes it easy to outline your lips for the perfect coverage and then fill it in for a professional look. I was able to try two different glosses and I loved both. It has a soft, delicate scent that is pleasant. The only drawback is the price per item. If it wasn’t for that, I’d probably own every shade available. Another plus is that it’s sheer, I love sheer lipstick, glosses and crayons. I’ve recommended this brand to several friends and a few have tried it and like it too !"

The texture of the Juicy Tubes Birthday Confetti just doesn't appeal to me. It's very goopy and leaves a yucky taste and chalky texture in my mouth.   The color is extremely subtle and doesn't do much for me. I feel like it exacerbates my fine lines around my lips.  On the plus side, when I wipe it off my lips, it still leaves a light hydrating coat on my lips. This is the texture I would have preferred from the beginning.   It reminds me of something I would have worn in Jr. High. But I don't think it's a good match for someone my age."

But the Birthday confetti had lots of colorful pretty HD sparkle that shimmers nice in the sunlight. The Hallucination also has sparkle but it’s more of an overall muted light rose Pink shimmer.   Great lip gloss to wear alone or over another lip color if you’re looking for more tint since this gloss is VERY sheer.  Two things I did not prefer. It’s sticky. The kind of lip gloss your hair sticks in and you have to pull it out. And the smell. It smells like perfume and I am very sensitive to smells and I couldn’t stand the smell. Unfortunately I had to wipe it off and couldn’t wear it... The smell for the Birthday Confetti was stronger than the Hallucination. I would have loved it to come in a  light yummy fruity scent instead, or unscented.  If you have no sensitivity to scent and are looking for a sheer sparkle that stays- then definitely try it out.  ***I received this product in return for my honest review."

It’s smooth and only gets slightly tacky which I think works for lasting longer. Stay hydrated. Thanks so much for the opportunity to sample this product.  I would definitely purchase this color in the future and it’s decent compared to other brands that I’ve used and last longer."

I was so pleasantly surprised to find out that I was so wrong! This looks amazing on folks of all ages! It feels a bit sticky but it's a lip gloss so that's to be expected. Not to mention it's called Juicy Tubes, as in Tubes filled with Juice. Lol so you kind of have to accept that and move on. Lol  You have to reapply it every so often and touch it up. Especially after you eat or drink anything or if you smoke or vape. Other than that, I have absolutely no complaints about this hot little item. In my opinion, this will definitely make your summer sizzle while being flirty on the beach."

I was pleasantly surprised to find that maybe their formula had changed and they are now sufficiently sticky, very moisturizing but lasted about the same.  In comparison to other glosses, Juicy Tubes don't last as long as many of the Buxom glosses, but much longer than some of the more basic ones.  Despite the two colors I got (Hallucination & Birthday Confetti), they were equally sheer and didn't add any additional color to my lips, but I am not generally looking for that as I wear over matte lip colors a lot (especially for moisture).  I would buy and recommend, Lancome doesn't tout them to be long lasting, but they fit the bill for moisturizing and are comfortable to wear."

This provides a natural sheer lip color with sweet glossy shine and leave the lips naturally beautiful. The lip gloss comes in a squeezable tube which can be easily carried in a small purse or pouch. This is creamy and soft in texture, moisturizes the lips and I love how it feels on my lips. This glides onto my lips smoothly and looks perfect on their own or over your lipstick. Overall a great quality lip gloss. I am glad I got this to try and will buy again when am out."

The Birthday Confetti shade is a pale clear pink with many pieces of iridescent rainbow glitter. The shade Hallucination is a Rose Gold with less noticeable gold glitter. Both applied similarly,  with a clear shine and particles of glitter. They both felt slightly tacky/sticky. I prefer a lighter weight gloss with a bit more color payoff (on a tinted shade). I also feel like for the price, I want more of a multi-tasking product with moisture benefits. The Birthday Confetti smelled sweet; I didn’t detect this scent in Hallucination, neither had any flavoring. A decent gloss but I can do just as well or better with a drugstore brand. I received this product free in exchange for my honest review. My review is my opinion based on my experience using the product."

I have been obsessed with more glossier lippies now, and this became my absolute favorite. I may even apply this over my matte lipstick for more glossier look.   I tried various drug store products, but decided that I prefer a more high end, this product is less sticky, and contains less of the fragrance. It applies smoothly and last for 2-3 hours.   Higher brand items like Lancome use safer ingredients, which is good for my lips, and I am not ingesting harmful chemicals.   I would repurchase this product when it runs out, and I recommend this product to my family and friends. I had two of the lancome juicy tubes, I shared one with my mother for mother's day and she absolutely loved it. I noticed that she has been using this product every day."

I also use these glosses to go over the lipstick that I had already applied on my lips to make a new and more vibrant glossy and sparkly shade! Gloss goes on a bit tacky (use the applicator tip at the end of the tube rather than your fingers).  Stays put and moisturizes my lips for hours.  Glad Lancome bought Juicy Tubes back because they are totally iconic items!  They are outstanding lip glosses!!!!!!!! And are regular items in my purse and make up bags!"

The Hallucination color does not have as much shiny flakes as the Birthday Confetti but they are both very shiny. A little goes a long way. It is reminiscent of MAC's Lipglass. Although it's too glossy and the nude is too light for my taste, this would be a perfect gloss for a younger person."

These glided easily on to my lips thanks to the angled tip applicator. However, they were very sticky feeling and there was very little color payoff - I basically just noticed shine (and sparkle in the case of Birthday Confetti). Overall, I think the quality of these is not any better than drugstore brands."

It’s beautiful! Hallucination is a bronze-y/copper with gold shimmer.  It is pretty too, but doesn’t look great with my skin tone. I’m not a huge fan of the applicator.  It’s a tube with a slanted tip.  I just prefer a wand to use because the tip gets a little gunky! The gloss is also a bit sticky.  It’s not too bad though.   I like that you can’t really feel the shimmer in it.  It just feels smooth on the mouth.  I received these for free."

Your lips aren't sticky like other products cause, and your lips look more plumped. Lancome Juicy Tubes are my new go-to lip gloss. I will always have the Birthday Confetti in my purse so I'll never run out. I highly recommend Lancome Juicy Tubes. You won't be disappointed."

Both were received completely free to try and review. I am passionate about JT because it not only provides brightness but also color, that is, it is multifunctional.

These Juicy lip tubes are everything a girl could ever possibly want in a lip gloss. My lip gloss is popping! That’s for sure!! I absolutely adore the names of each color range of gloss. And by far my favorite thing about these glosses is that they aren’t that gross kind of sticky gloss that we all hate! These glosses are boujie of the boujiest!  Love that the shiny gloss actually makes lips look plumper and fuller. Not to mention the sparkle is spectacular. I have already recommended these to my friends, family, and followers. And I’ll be buying more! For sure!! Stock up ladies, and gents! I can see these flying off the shelves before you know it. Highly recommend these beauties in a tube."

			"review_text": "These give your lips a sheer tint of color.  This one on me is more on the clear side.    Makes your lips look healthy and juicy!!  This gloss also has gold sparkles but doesn't feel gritty.  Outdoors the lips look so shiny and shimmery!  They are a gloss so they're not going to completely dry down but they do dry down some.  Also they are comfortable on the lips, but they do have a slight tacky feel to them.  Nothing major, but I know some people don't like any tackiness.  It's not the lightest formula of a gloss I have tried, but I still do like it.  They actually do give your lips some moisture, not just shine so that's definitely a plus!  I do use it while and home and toss it in my purse when I'm going out.  These glosses would look great with a bronzy summery makeup look.  The packaging on these is great, clear tube with angled applicator, and a cap/lid  that is secure.   Birthday confetti pulls more clear on me, not really a strong color compared to hallucination which you can tell is a brownish sheer color."

I love Birthday confetti. It’s the perfect gloss for any occasion. It has a very slight pink tint, but really comes off translucent with major shine and a little glitter. It glides on easy and is super long lasting. I love that it is thick enough to stay put, but not so thick that it has a sticky glue feeling. It maintains a neutral look, but has enough shine to be able to wear when dressing up.  I love layering this gloss as well. I have layered it with #09, Hallucination, to add a little color.  The 0.5 fl oz size tube is perfect for carrying in a small purse or clutch. Since a little goes a long way, the tube should last quite a while.  I don’t have any negatives with this gloss. It is my new go to and I am looking forward to trying other colors!"

I was obsessed from the first moment I sampled a friend's Juicy Tube and subsequently dragged my mother to several department stores begging for the just-barely-there pinks. To this day, the smell of a fresh Juicy Tube evokes the most pleasant nostalgia to me. While the smell has evolved somewhat over the years from a honeysuckle to more of a vanilla, I still get that giddy feeling every time I open one and breathe it in.  I love the feeling of Juicy Tubes on my lips and I love the glossiness. I never get that gummy, sticky feeling I get with some glosses and Juicy Tubes stay and stay. My lips feel moisturized and soft. Even with the glitter in my current favorite Birthday Confetti, I don't feel like an overly glossed preteen. The glitter is subtle and just adds a glossiness to my lips. I don't think it's meant to be plumping, but I always feel like my lips are a little bit plumper when I use these as opposed to other glosses.   I love the packaging (also hasn't really ever had to change!) and how much control you have over the product application.  I'm so glad that Juicy Tubes have remained for sale all of these years. They've taken me through my pre-teen years all the way into working-professional-adulthood without changing their formula too much and remaining one of the very few products that has been a mainstay of my makeup bag for 20 years!"

They are very moisturizing, not sticky at all, comfortable on the lips, it’s a convenient tube that you can just throw in your purse or your pocket and just apply any time, you don’t need a mirror because they are sheer. Great for the summer with just a hint of color, I will be buying other shades to try"

Hallucination smells mildly of bubble gum, while Birthday Confetti smells like vanilla/cake. Third, they feel great on. Fourth, there is a slight sweet, barely there, flavor.  Hallucination adds just the slightest hint of color on your lips...almost none. Birthday adds no color.  This is slightly sticky. Your hair will tend to stick to your lips if it comes in contact. When pressing lips together, it’s slightly sticky.  They really are beautiful glosses, though."

They do not feather or bleed at all like other brands do on my mature skin. Also, my favorite color (Hallucination) will adapt somehow to match absolutely any color I happen to be wearing, whether it's a cool or warm pink, red, brown, or neutral tone. All around, Juicy Tubes are the best lip gloss out there & so very worth the price."

Most lip gloss applicators are a wand full of goop, impossible to retouch your makeup without risking getting it on your clothes if your on the go, or ruining a perfect pout. I thought the glitter was going to be a bit much for me.  But no, this is a fun touch a sparkle that you can add to almost any look.  I would recommend every woman have this is in their tool chest for that girls night out or a special night in with your partner. The price point is pretty friendly to try out different shades, and it hydrates and lasts on your lips for a long time, well past the coffee test."

After not trying a Juicy Tube in maybe 15 years this product makes me feel nostalgic. It still feels like the same exact formula. This is a thick gloss and slightly sticky. You will feel it on your lips and not forget it’s there. It’s not going to last all day but on the plus side when it starts to fade away it will leave your lips feeling moisturized underneath. As far as the appearance if you like a very glossy lip I don’t think you can do any better than a juicy tube. Another plus is the shades are soft enough that you can layer the gloss on top of a liner or lipstick for a glossy finish. To me, the scent is not my favorite and doesn’t compete well with newer products in the same category. Personally, I prefer a more natural scent- this could be a light floral or just an essential oil. This scent is more chemical to me and a little too sweet smelling that it’s nauseating. If you like a very glossy lip and don’t mind feeling the product when you’re wearing it then this is the gloss for you!"

The glitter is fine, so it's not like you end up with big sparkly chucks, which is nice. I was concerned though, as I don't do products with glitter in them unless it is the biodegradable glitter that they make out of I think seaweed. Have no idea what kind of glitter product is in this and for me personally, would find out the answer before I committed to buying. It is also sticky on the lips, more so right after application. I didn't really fault it for this though, cause I expect glosses to be a bit sticky. But the main reason I gave it 4 starts is because after wearing it all day (the stickiness fades as you lose your coating thru the day) my lips were super soft. They hydrated them better than most of my chapsticks."

I would definitely buy this gloss and recommend it to my fellow gloss lovers out there!"

When I tried to triple apply the application you see more if the faint color but who wants to use half the tube just for color appearance! Other than that! It’s great for gloss, and I wear gloss on my lips plain and over top of my lipstick!

Other glosses I've tried dont really last too long, but this I can say does. Definitely recommend having this around at all times. I've even mixed it with other lipsticks I have and they really increase the look of the other lipsticks.  Definitely recommend!"

The first is called “Hallucination.” It’s a nice light-nude pink with a gold sheen and sparkle. It smells amazing! Almost like fruity cotton candy, it smells actually delicious. I love the feel of Juicy Tubes on my lips, because it’s not too sticky like some glosses I have used. It’s moisturizing and hydrating, while staying put for a long time. It has just the right amount of sparkle and color. The other color I received was named, “birthday confetti,” and like its name suggests, it smells exactly like a piece of cake with vanilla frosting. Just delicious!! It is light pink in color, with a bit of silver sparkle and sheen. I love having these on hand to finish off any look. I would definitely recommend Lancôme lip products to anyone."

I prefer these to any glosses I have tried from other companies, and for me the only drawback was the taste. I wasn't so fond of that, hence the 4 star rating.

Hallucination has a pretty, soft, natural tint while Birthday Confetti is sheer with a hint of sparkle. Cons: Both have a warm, kind-of-burning feeling like a lip plumper but there is no pumping affect.

I’d say a good in between point where it’s thick enough to last, but doesn’t feel heavy on your lips.   I enjoy that the shimmer particles are very fine, so they won’t irritate your lips and you won’t feel any scratching.   The main selling point for me is the packaging. I do not like getting my lip colors on gloss applicators, and altering the color in the bottle, so the squeeze tube is perfect for avoiding that.   The Only drawback is that the pigment is very sheer so there isn’t much color payoff. But you can comfortably wear on top of a lip color if that is a concern of yours. For me personally, it’s not a deterrent from purchasing more colors in the future."

My lips have a plump feeling after I put it on, and it lasts about an hour before I feel like swiping more on again. I like to layer this on top of a matte color to add some fun shine."

I have been wearing them for over 10 years- and I have tried to find a suitable replacement- but NOTHING COMPARES. All of these other lip stick/gloss fads are drying and do not wear well over time. Even your other glosses, Mademoiselle Shine for example, and the others, are drying where I have to repeatedly apply and my lips begin to peel. I’ve never had this issue with the juicy tubes.  The viscosity of the gloss, the lengthn of it's wear, how my lips remain soft and supple, how I don't need to keep reapplying, and how beautiful it makes my pout- is WHY I love it. Please bring this tried and true product back!"

The gloss is dense, in most shades there is a small beautiful shimmer, perhaps this is the most persistent gloss of all that I had, it gives a very beautiful visual effect, it is economical to use, it does not flow into the creases of the lips, it does not slip, it does not smear along the contour even without lip pencil, excellent holding, moisturizes and smoothes lips, as well as slightly enlarges the lips, they become puffier. . The aroma is pleasant, sweet and citrus, it does not feel on the lips. Very beautiful gloss, these overflows and shimmer, I like and recommend it!"

Cosmetic technology has made such vast improvements in the last 20 years that I'd forgotten what it's like to wear a sticky, goopy gloss that catches every flyaway hair. I'd much rather wear a modern shiny-but-not-sticky lip oil. Also, I'd forgotten these have that sickly sweet fake-melon scent. Basically, this is the cosmetic equivalent of bringing back the steel-belted bullet bra—why would you when you could use something new that works so much better?"

It wasn't so much a flavor variety as it was a different packaging covered in stars and the smell was heavenly! It smells just like cake. It also had glitter in it.

I would recommend these to a friend or anyone who wants a gloss that they can wear everyday with that little extra something to it.

Everything from the shape of the tube, to the scent and the extremely sheer (virtually clear) color with huge sparkles.......  Since I have long hair, I usually don't wear gloss, because the mere suggestion of a breeze causes my hair to stick to my lips.  However, if you have more manageable hair than I do, these glosses aren't really that sticky---nowhere near the stickiness of say, the old timey MAC Lipglass.   But the downside is that they obviously don't last long on the lip.  Maybe an hour at most, assuming you don't eat or drink.   (And if you do, you'll leave an ugly mark on your cup or glass.)  The Birthday Confetti color is almost completely transparent and colorless on the lip, save for the giant sparkles.   It looks pink in the tube, but there's no color in reality.  On the lip the sparkles are fairly sparse, but sizewise...they're giant, and a little childish......  I guess you just have to be in the right mood to wear a gloss.  It's high maintenance, and super-impractical, but it also gives you visibly plump looking lips, and it screams nostalgia!"

Step back into the 90's (or come for a visit if you were born after the 90's) and relive it with Lacomes Juice Tubes!!   I was so excited when I knew this was a product that I would be testing out! I was always a fan of lipgloss tubes when I was a young girl. Nice glossy lips with a little bit of stick to them. (though from what I remember the stick back then was a tad bit more stickier than this gloss is. The glossier the lips the better in my honest opinion.  Both of the glosses I received (which was Hallucination and Birthday Confetti) were awesome and made my lips feel hydrated and look glossy! I literally was suffering from summer chapped lips (YUCK!!) and applied it to my lips and felt instant coolness on them. Look out chapstick you might be put away for a little bit while I have these glosses in my possession. (Muahahahaha!!)  *Ahem*   Ways to apply to your lips:   Apply to naked lips. Apply on top of lipsticks to really bring a shine to that lipstick. Apply to dry or chapped lips   Overall...   This was a super sweet blast from the past! If you're looking for something that makes your lips look super glossy without that icky sticky feeling that typical glosses leave behind I recommend buying this brand of gloss! You will not be dissapointed!"

They didn’t feel sticky really unless you apply a lot - but my hair did catch into it a few times, no matter how little or how much gloss I applied.

First off i just wanted to say the formulation has been changed from the old ones (for the better or for worse? I can't really tell after just a few days of use); but so far I like it alot. I don't know if it's just me, but the gloss stays moisturized for longer than the old tubes (yay!) But I will say that the smell of the gloss was changed. It's not the sweet fruity scented gloss it was before anymore. The  birthday confetti smells like birthday cake (as expected), and I love the smell and the taste on my lips. Hallucination reminds me of something more floral and more on the perfumey side. Not my favorite, but I do love the color, so I guess it's a tradeoff. The quality of the gloss itself seems to be the same, high gloss, moisturizing, long lasting gloss!! Overall, I am so happy that these are back, and I am begging you (Lancome) to make these a staple and please dont discontinue these glosses again!!"

It is a thicker gloss, so if thin glosses are your thing, well, try these anyways. My lips felts so hydrated after putting these on, and it definitely felt like it would keep the moisture locked in even on a cold windy day.   The description of the glosses is right on. An original juicy lip gloss with ultra-high shine, four hours of lasting hydration, and the perfect amount of sticky cushion texture. The sticky cushion texture is just as you would think. Not too sticky, not too thin. My lips were left soft and not gummy or messy-sticky.   Both of them also have some sweet scents. 09 Hallucination reminded me of a jolly rancher, maybe strawberry or watermelon flavor? 20 Birthday Confetti had less of a scent, but it was still sweet. And neither tasted bad if they got in my mouth, they tasted just as they smelled, sweet and candy-like.   The two shades I got gave a nice sheer coverage with some shine and sparkle, so if you are afraid of bold color, these are for you. The applicator is like that of the Laneige Glowy Balms. They are similar in coverage and scent-intensity as well. I'd say the Lancome Juicy Tubes are thicker, however.   Overall, I thought these were great glosses and I would love to get some more shades. They are perfect for on the go and easy to throw in a bag. I definitely recommend these. I received these products free to try from Bzzagent."

Birthday Confetti is an almost colorless gloss (a slight pink tint, but not noticeably), however, it is indeed very recognizably sparkly! I think it looks so nice on, it is so so pretty, and it would work great on top of some lipstick as well. The next shade, Hallucination, does have more of a tint to it. It's a nudish gloss, and like Birthday Confetti, it is very sparkly!  Both glosses did not feel sticky or tacky, they felt very smooth and, from what I can tell, moisturizing.   I have seen some complaints that these new juicy tubes aren't scented/flavored like the old version, but since I never tried the precious Juicy Tubes I have no complaints! I am thoroughly enjoying my new glosses."

There is some glitter but, not an unpleasant amount where you might look like a disco ball. the forumla is slighty tacky and I definitely don't recommend wearing this during a windy day with your open otherwise, it will stick to your lips.

My lips feel hydrated and not sticky. These glosses are very high shine. And even though I didn't use them before the components feel very nostalgic. I would definitely recommend these lip glosses.."

Lancôme brought back some classic shades and some new ones. The Birthday Confetti is new to commemorate the 20th Bday of Juicy Tubes. These glosses aren’t sticky, they’re slightly tacky, keyword slightly. This particular shade BIRTHDAY CONFETTI has a subtle vanilla scent. Think Bath & Body Works Warm Vanilla Sugar. I love that the juicy tubes comes in a variety of scents from gourmand to fruity. I’m wearing it as I write this review. HYDRATING, BRILLIANT SHINE! The glitters in these things are so finely milled that it doesn’t feel like you’re rubbing sandpaper on your lips. If you’re looking for a Juicy pout, try one definitely give Juicy Tubes a try."

			"review_text": "I know the nostalgia of the Juicy Tubes, but when I tried on the Marshmallow Electro light pink shimmer shade it just was not doing it for me. The formula is still left in the 2000s which falls flat in comparison to more modern iterations of tube gloss and gloss in general. The shade and shimmer is beautiful but what does that really matter when the formula gets goopy in the waterline? You can put the smallest amount on and there will be patches of clumped up gloss in the inner lip that stick and get stringy when you talk, aka my worst nightmare with gloss. It isn’t thick like Mac Lipglass, or sticky like Glossier, it’s buttery but it just feels less hydrating and slightly dry, like a cold butter that is hard to spread. $20 for this tube is essentially cashing your check for nostalgia purposes, and if that’s what you wanna do with your money then go for it, but I will be enjoying my Tower28, Colourpop, Jouer, Fenty, Pat McGrath, Ciate, and other brands that actually got the formula right. I’ll give it 3 stars for the color/shimmer as it’s gorgeous, the original packaging and easy application, but remove 2 stars for formula and price."

The shade I got is a gorgeous baby pink, sheer and looks like glass on my lips. Makes my lips look JUICY. I already can’t wait to pick up tickled pink and clear, and I’ll probably end up getting the rest of these. I do think the price could be cheaper because the packaging looks very cheap and dollar store-ish. But the product is a 10/10 and you do get a lot of product for the price, I would recommend these to everyone I know"
