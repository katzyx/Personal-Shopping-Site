			"review_text": "I don’t like anything about this. lol La Mer face creams are so overrated & overpriced. First off, does anyone actually like the scent of these products? It’s smells so artificial & just not good imo. WHY?! The first two ingredients are just water & silicones.. For this price point, I expect the bulk of the formula to be better quality ingredients. I could be wrong, but I didn’t see mineral oil/paraffin/petroleum listed in this one, while they are in La Mer’s other face creams, so that is one possible improvement at least. If you want any moisture, this is not for you. Definitely for oily skin girlies only. I normally have very clear skin. I test new skincare frequently & this is the first cream that’s broken me out in forever. I do avoid silicones & artificial fragrance in my usual routine, so I imagine they’re the culprits. It also made my favorite trusted tinted SPF pill on me, which it has never done in the 3 years of using it. Again, probably the crazy high silicone content’s fault. So definitely need silicone-based base products with this. Yes, there are some good ingredients mixed into this water & silicone-based formula, but the cons are just so bad, I can’t see any beneficial pros from them :( I received sample sizes to test, so I can’t comment on the quality of the actual packaging, however, that doesn’t look impressive from the pictures. lol Hopefully it’s at least glass, but dang, it’s looks cheap & ugly & that’s just sad for something high-end. Do yourself a favor & get one of the hundreds of moisturizers that are far superior & cheaper. *gifted by lamer"

I’ve primarily used in the AM as it doesn’t quite have enough moisture for my normal, mature skin. But I think the gel cream consistency is perfect for morning, and seems to layer well with my other skincare products and under makeup. It specifically says for oily skin types, and I think this is actually perfect for that skin type. Love how it feels on my skin, and it definitely looks hydrated. Mild fragrance which I typically don’t care for in skincare but it didn’t bother me. Too soon to tell if there were any changes with my skin, and would probably need a full size product. I’ve enjoyed it and would consider buying for morning use."

The 3.5ml sample size is generous enough to allow for a thorough trial, and I appreciate that it's formulated without harsh ingredients like parabens, formaldehydes, and sulfates. Knowing that it's free of these chemicals gives me peace of mind about what I'm putting on my skin. The Miracle Broth-infused formula feels luxurious upon application, and I can feel it working to rebalance sebum production and defend against signs of aging. After incorporating it into my skincare routine, I've noticed an improvement in my skin's firmness and elasticity, as well as a reduction in excess oiliness. Overall, La Mer's Moisturizing Fresh Cream has exceeded my expectations, delivering on its promise of refreshed balance and a firmer feel. It's become a staple in my skincare regimen, and I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for an effective moisturizer, especially those with oilier skin types like mine. Gifted by lamer."

Super cute minis and the pouch it came in was so pretty too! This has a fairly potent fragrance that reminds me of baby powder. It has another scent I’m not familiar with but it dissipates fairly quickly once applied to the skin.   This does have a nice gel texture that absorbs fast and leaves my skin feeling pleasantly hydrated. No major dewy or glowy finish but I think this would work best with oily or normal skin types. I am dry to normal skin type during the winter months too. I find this to be the perfect amount of hydration and texture. If you have super dry skin, I’m not sure if this will be hydrating enough. Though you can always pair it with a facial oil too. I am enjoying this so far and would recommend to anyone looking for a new boujee moisturizer!"
