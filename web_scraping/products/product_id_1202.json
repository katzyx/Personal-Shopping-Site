When I started my hair was a lil bit dry from blow dry and straightener. After about 3 weeks I realized my hair was breaking off, it felt like hay and soon as I would get it wet it would tangle up really bad. I added not conditioner, I tried everything using just Olaplex products but it only got worse. As I cried touching my hair I realized it was this product OLAPLEX that was killing my hair. I still have all the products but will never use this crap again. Maybe I can use it on the dog. I am still trying to grow out the damage that Olaplex did to my hair. And I have switched back to my usual products. I use It's A 10. And should have never tried Olaplex. Wish I could have gotten my money back, this crap is expensive."

I can wear my hair straight, in a blowout, or in my natural waves, which help combat the frizz, no matter which style. I also have damage from regular coloring, and these help nourish and moisturize my hair. A little product goes a long way - especially with the hair oil. It is easy to shake out more than you need, which can cause you to end up with greasy hair, but the perfect amount makes all the difference for the better in your hair. *This review was collected as part of a promotion*"

This set would be a great addition to anyone’s hair care lineup, especially anyone who has color or sun damage. Living in Florida I also need a good frizz control set, and these products do not disappoint. I love to use the No. 6 Bond Smoother and No. 7 Binding Oil in combination with one another after my hair washing days. It leaves my hair smooth, controlled, and soft whether I air dry or blow dry. As always I love using Olaplex products because of the heat protectant that is included, so this is a huge plus when I do choose to use heat. The No. 7 Binding Oil has also been a great on-the-go product when the frizz becomes too much on a hot and humid day. The smell is always a bonus too!"

These two definitely work to fight frizz and signs of damaged hair, and don't forget about flyaways. I love the bond smoother can either go on damp or dry hair. It's easy to work into hair. I personally apply it to damp here. Once my hair is dry, I like to add in the bonding oil, which helps my hair lock in the No.6 bonding smoother and leaves my hair looking flawless the next 72 hours.   The texture of No.6 is creamy and lightweight, and No.5 is liquidity but not sticky. I like how my hair looks and have received many compliments. The ingredients are great and safe. I will continue to use this product in my hair routine."

This set includes the No. 6 bond smoother and No. 7 bonding hair oil that work together to tame frizz and enhance shine. The formula is infused with Olaplex’s signature Bond Building Technology, which strengthens hair from within, reducing breakage and promoting a healthier look. My hair felt noticeably softer and more manageable after just one use. I have been using No.6 for years now and have loved all of the benefits from continued use. The scent is subtly pleasant, and a little product goes a long way especially for the oil. The price is such a great deal for those who want to try both of these products at a discounted price. Perfect for achieving sleek, shiny locks without weighing down your hair. Highly recommend for anyone seeking to improve texture and shine."

The OLAPLEX Get Your Shine On Frizz Control Hair Set was exactly what I needed to tame my hair while boosting its shine. Over the course of my use, I found that the No. 6 Bond Smoother® really helped in reducing frizz and keeping my hair smooth throughout the day. It made my blow-dry sessions a breeze, leaving my hair soft and manageable. The No.7 Bonding Oil™ added a noticeable shine that I hadn’t seen in my hair for a while. The combination of these two products provided me with a sleek, healthy look without weighing my hair down. The texture of the No. 6 Bond Smoother® was creamy but light, making it easy to distribute through my damp hair. The No. 7 Bonding Oil™ was lightweight and absorbed quickly, leaving no greasy residue. If your hair is dry or lacks luster, this set could be a game-changer in restoring shine and smoothness.  **This review was collected as part of a promotion."

It has to be sleek, frizz free and shiny.  The Olaplex Get Your Shine On Frizz Control Set delivers the desired results for my straightened hair styles. I start with no.6 while my hair is damp, blow dry it until it's dry and straight enough, then I apply no.7 - the bonding oil - from root to end before flat ironing the hair stick straight. I apply a little more oil overall making sure to get the fly aways and leaving some shine.   I love that these products alone and together done weigh down my hair. It's perfectly balanced and leaves my hair soft, smooth and shiny."

			"review_text": "I have extremely thick 3a bleached blonde hair that I straighten weekly and have for... over a decade now! I can credit Olaplex for the fact that my hair is down to my waist with no breakage issues! I went from wearing extensions to needing hair cuts because my hair grows so strong and long! As Olaplex releases new products, my hair health only improves even more beyond what I thought was possible! This anti-frizz kit makes it so that I can use less heat as my straightened hair stays straight and frizz free. No touch ups with my iron means less exposure to damaging heat! Once I straighten my hair, it stays sleek, even in Florida humidity! I used to travel with my hair iron and now I don't because I know these products will keep my hair flawless for days.  After my wash day, I apply no. 7 to my slightly damp hair. My hair being damp helps it spread easily once I use a wet-safe brush to coat all my strands evenly. I let my hair air dry and then straighten it with 100% assurance that Olaplex no.7 protects me from my flat iron's heat. I use 350 degrees F and no.7 protects up to 450 degrees F for those who need more heat to get straight. Even better, my hair smells so incredible and it's left with a glossy shine (which is very hard to attain as a platinum blonde). Last, I apply no. 6 and blow dry my hair into a blowout hairstyle. No. 7 provides protection and shine while no. 6 provides humidity and frizz protection. I have such a smooth bouncy glossy blowout when I pair these two together and I love knowing that not only do I look great, but my hair is being repaired from within."

When using  Olaplex No. 6 and No. 7, from the Get Your Shine On Sleek Hair Styling Duo, I have let my hair air dry and instantly noticed when my hair is curly and dries it is almost completely frizz free; however, when I wake up my hair has gotten some frizz due to my movements when I’m sleeping. I love how my hair looks, it is healthier and shiny. Once I flat iron my hair it is smooth and sleek. No. 6 smells good and has a cream consistency. It doesn’t feel greasy in your hair at all. I do like to add a little bit more of both products to my dry hair for more shine and for heat protection. The No. 7 oil bottle is hard to get the oil out of, you have to shake it onto your hand. I wish there was like a dropper or a pump to get the oil out instead. I do love that this oil is a heat protectant up to 450°. I can’t get over how soft my hair feels. This duo doesn’t feel like it weighs my hair down, in fact it feels nice a light. I really like these two products, especially as a set."

My hair is usually dry and dull, even though I don’t color it. I use a hair dryer and flat iron a lot, so I needed something to help with frizz and add moisture. The No. 6 Bond Smoother is a leave-in cream that keeps my hair smooth and frizz-free for days. I like that you can use it with a blow dryer or when letting your hair air dry. You only need one pump of the No. 6 and a little bit of the No. 7, so the bottles will last a long time. The oil is light but very effective, and it protects my hair from heat, which is perfect since I use a flat iron often. The light scent is also lovely and not overpowering, which I really appreciate. It’s also a very beautiful set, and I’m thinking of ordering it for my mom and sister for Christmas. Olaplex always makes great products, and this set is no different. After using it, my hair feels more hydrated and looks shinier. I'm so glad I found this set! This review was collected as part of a promotion."

I then go in with the no. 7 bonding oil once my hair is dry, usually after I style it. It brings shine and life back to my hair and makes it look so healthy! Both of these products are easy to use, an amazing texture, and smell great! They leave my hair looking nourished and healthy until my next wash day.   I love that both these products also work to repair my hair from the inside out.

			"review_text": "Oils are super important to me. The hair needs oil to help with any decreasing oil retention levels or to bring that slight shine back to the hair. This sleek hair-shining duo from Olaplex is one of a kind. It comes with a bonding oil and it's legendary no.6 bond smoother. I'm always down for any hair product that either builds, repairs, or restores but also keeps hair with a natural rich luster. The bonding oil comes with moringa and sunflower seed oil. This oil brings nourishment but also keeps it locked in and intertwines within each strand. A little goes a long way with this oil and I love how the opening dropper controls how much the hair actually needs versus just adding an unnecessary amount of oil to the hair. This oil does not weigh down the hair at all, which I thoroughly enjoyed about the bonding oil. The bond smoother was great because I used this before doing a blowout on my hair. This cream helped with the blowout process because my hair was more manageable but it also cut down the time to where I had to use various tools or add more product to achieve better results. This duo is a match made in heaven. Olaplex will never steer you in the wrong direction when it comes to maintaining healthy hair or correcting strands that need more time to replenish/restore to its highest potential."

I usually use them together, but sometimes I use one without the other, the result is always beautiful, the No. 6 Bond Smoother is fantastic for taming my frizz, even in humid conditions. It leaves my hair feeling smooth to the touch, and a little goes a long way. It's not sticky and doesn't leave any residue on my hair. The No. 7 Bonding Oil is the most amazing hair oil I have ever tried. Just a few drops, and the shine is incredible! It doesn't weigh down my curls, it's not sticky, and the best part, it even doubles as heat protection!

From the moment I unboxed it to see the gorgeous gold packaging to beholding the beautiful golden oil in its thoughtful, sleek bottle to efficiently applying the leave-in bond smoother from a perfect pump allocator I was hooked. My 4C hair enjoyed the moisturizing of the oil and leave-in overnight while my hair set on heatless rollers. In the morning, I had a smooth take-down and I enjoyed my loose, soft curls until lunchtime. In all fairness, I was in humid weather today so it was difficult to maintain the style.

			"review_text": "One of my favorite brands is Olaplex. At this point, I had my hair colored and bleached. I was amazed by how well this duo actually accomplishes what it claims to. When my hair was still 70% moist, I applied a mixture of two pumps of No. 6 and one drop of No. 7. I worked the mixture from the root to the end. After that, I blow-dried my hair as usual. My fine, straight Asian hair, which has been bleached and dyed, is considerably less frizzy and has improved texture and its shine. My hair is noticeably softer now that I've blow dried it. My hair feels so smooth without being slippery is a plus!      I typically give my hair a wash once every two days. When I need to add a little extra shine and smoothness in between washes, No. 7 works excellent on the first or even the second hair day. When I wash my hair, I use No. 6 to keep it looking and feeling fresh.     My hair continues to be smoother and less frizzy even though I live in a hot, humid climate. There are two full-sized No. 6 and No. 7 in this Get your shine on collection. This means that the set will last for a considerable amount of time as well. I heartily endorse these pair!"

			"review_text": "As someone who deals with frizz often with my 2a hair that is just below my waist, I was very excited to see how well this kit would work for me and let me say after trying out this amazing kit, I love the results. I love that you can use either product on its own, mix them, or layer them. Both have a nice fragrance to them that is not overpowering and more on the subtle side.  The No. 6 Bond Smoother Frizz Control Styling Hair Cream has a nice creamy texture and it does not take a lot of product to use on the hair, even for someone like me with very long hair. It is very lightweight and doesn't weigh down my hair at all. I prefer to use it right after the shower since it's suggested to use on damp hair.  As for the the No. 7 Bonding Frizz Reduction & Heat Protectant Hair Oil, while it is an oil, it did not leave my hair feeling oily at all nor did it leave my hands feeling oily after applying. I love that you can turn it upside down and the oil doesn't come out until you tap on the bottom of the bottle. The way it dispenses makes you only get the amount you want. Due to the length and amount of hair I have, I did use a little more than the recommended 2-3 drops but just like with the cream, it doesn't take a lot of product either. While I have used it after using the No. 6 hair cream, I also have used it on dry hair as needed on its own.  *This review was collected as part of a promotion*"

I have previously bought the number 7 oil and really enjoyed it! I like that it is also a heat protectant. I can use this every single day if I wanted to! It makes my hair look great and a lot less frizzy. This was my first time trying number 6 and I really enjoyed it. I apply it to damp hair, then use number 7 and blow dry my hair and it looks like I left the salon! I love that it’s working to repair my hair. I’ve been struggling lately with hair breakage and I know products can’t fix all the damage but it’s definitely working to help erase some of it! I’m truly thankful for these products and the confidence boost this is giving me."

I was particularly impressed with the hair oil (No 7) which feels more like an oily serum than a straight oil to me. Instead of weighing my hair down like all other oils I’ve tried, this almost seems to add more structure and strength to my hair. I like smoothing it into my hair while it’s a little damp or the days after wash day when my hair is starting to look a little frizzy. This oil does not sit on top of my hair but seems to absorb quickly, so it does not make my hair look greasy. I use the leave in smoother (No 6) in place of my usual leave in conditioner and it does a much better job of keeping my hair soft and conditioned. It does a great job smoothing my frizzy hair, while letting my waves show through, but is great with the hair oil layered on top. I would recommend this set to anyone who has issues with frizz, especially if you have issues with leave in products weighing down your hair."

To begin, these two products were the first products that I have ever tried from Olaplex, so I truly did not know what to expect as I never had any previous experience with the brand. I have super thick, and very long hair so finding products that don't weigh it down even more can be quite the challenge. However, to my surprise, no. 6 (Bond Smoother) did just the opposite! My hair has never been so tamed from using this product alone. I typically get a lot of flyaways at the very top of my head but after applying about a 1/2 -1 pump to my hair the frizz is nonexistent. As I also mentioned before, it does not weigh my hair down either. After blow drying and styling, I go in and also use the tiniest amount of no. 7 (hair oil) from the set. Let me just tell you, my hair has never looked AND felt so good. The hair oil is also super lightweight and a little goes a very long way. It makes my hair look so healthy and shiny. I truly am so pleased with both these two products especially when used together! This set would make the perfect gift for just about anyone, but especially those who love to care for their hair.

After using these two products, my hair looks so much stronger, shinier, and less frizzy. I have received many compliments about my hair and been asked if I just got my hair done. Many hair products make my hair feel soft but they don’t work as well as this duo. I am so impressed with how my hair looks and feels even two days after washing my hair.

Very long and color-treated my hair is temperamental and almost no after wash products work on it. I’ve  been eyeing Olaplex for awhile and this pair sounded made for me. I was happy with the generous bottle of leave in treatment because I have so much hair. And it smelled great. My hair became easier to manage after use. It’s perfect if I want to braid and air-dry. The oil added incredible shine. Overall this duo worked well"

After taking Olaplex twice a week for a few months, I can genuinely say that I've noticed a difference. It helps with frizz, for sure, but it also makes my hair seem shiny without turning oily and healthier in general. Although I'm not sure if it's improving or lengthening my hair, I would definitely suggest using this to help hair seem nicer and become smoother and shinier. My hair has also received keratin treatment, and I've found that this doesn't reduce how long the treatments last. *This review is collected as a part of promotion*"

I have truly put my hair through the ringer, and Olaplex products are probably the only reason I still have hair on my head. I have overprocessed my hair into oblivion, but I can always count on Olaplex to keep my hair on my head and prevent it from feeling like straw. If you have healthy hair, this set isn’t for you, simply because Olaplex mainly functions as a reparative product. If you have damaged hair, this set is lovely. The cream is perfect for blow drying or air drying and doesn’t weigh down fine hair. The oil is a great finishing touch or refresher for any routine. For best results, use in combination with the rest of the Olaplex line."

Once my hair was all dry and styled I applied the hair oil and it made a big difference in my hair. It tamed all my flyaways and added a lot of shine. Both products smell really good and control my frizz throughout the day. I've used other products in my hair before that would make my hair feel sticky and greasy but I didn’t get any of that with this duo.

I loved how this is a lightweight oil so it doesn’t weigh down my hair or make it feel greasy. I think that this is a great oil for all hair types that smells great as well. I also tried the Olplex 6 Blowout cream and I loved it. I used it on damp hair after I took a shower and evenly distributed it. It smelled really good and was thicker so you only needed one drop or else it would weigh your hair down. This cream helps detangle my hair and it gave me the smoothest, shiniest blowout. I went in with the bonding oil after to get rid of frizz and seal all the flyaways in. It worked like a charm. Overall I would definitely recommend Olaplex."

			"review_text": "So I want to start off by saying I usually don't like added fragrance in my beauty products especially for my face, but this is for my hair, so it's a little different. The fragrance in both products smells so good. I need Olaplex to bottle it into an actual fragrance and sell it, and I would buy it 100 percent. Not only does my hair smell good because of this duo, but it looks and feels good too. My hair always gets frizzy when it starts to dry hours after taking a shower. This bond smoother number 6 helps tame that frizzy mess. I use the bonding oil number 7 after the bond smoother and they really work well together. The bonus of the bonding oil is that it can also help with heat protection. So if I am styling my hair with heat tools, I will put it all over my hair besides the top. Only a few drops are needed because a little goes a long way. If I'm just styling my hair like normal, I use a little less and just focus on repairing my split ends. This kit has a value of $60 but it's only $42 which I think is a really good deal. I think both products work hand in hand together so well that it's a no-brainer to get and use them both. Might as well save some money in the process getting this duo since both products have become my hair must-haves. I definitely recommend getting this get your shine on sleek hair styling duo before it sells out. This review was collected as part of a promotion. All of the thoughts are my own, and this is my honest review of the hair styling duo."

The product is concentrated, so a little goes a long way. It works like a dream in taming frizz and flyaways. After blow-drying, my hair feels soft, bouncy, and looks polished, like I just stepped out of a salon.  The final touch is a few drops of the No. 7 Bonding Hair Oil. I warm it between my palms and gently work it through the mid-lengths to the ends. This oil adds a gorgeous shine without weighing my hair down. Plus, it provides essential heat protection.

Once my hair is wet, I simply comb and scrunch a pump of product through my hair. The next morning, my hair is smooth and completely frizz free. I use the No. 7 bonding oil when my hair is both wet or dry for extra frizz control. The oil is not heavy, and the scent is so good!

I am someone who hates having frizzy hair, so I am appreciative of Olaplex for creating a treatment to keep the baby hairs together and create a silky and smooth texture base within your hair. My only concern is that there is not enough product, especially for someone like myself who has long, thick, and dry hair and would need to use this product constantly. I would want this product in a larger size or compartment because I loved the results! Nonetheless, this product does its job in protecting your hair from frizzing, great for hairstyling, and maintaining a great shine!"

The Olaplex No.7 Bonding Oil is hands down one of my favorites. It gives my hair an incredible shine without making it greasy, plus it has a pleasant scent that's not overpowering.  The Olaplex No.6 Bond Smoother also lives up to its name, leaving my hair smooth and manageable. While the scent is distinct and not my favorite, the results are so impressive that it's easy to overlook. Another major plus is that it doubles as a heat protectant up to 450°F.
