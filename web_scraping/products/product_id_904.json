This non-comedogenic formula visibly blurs pores, stands up to sweat and humidity, and it's flashback-free. When you try, let it dry: This foundation's shades look different when wet vs. fully dry because of the high percent of pigment and ingredients that help provide the extreme long wear. When you pick your shade, make sure to let it dry down completely to see the true color of the pigments...Clinical Results: In a consumer study on 30 volunteers, immediately after application:.- 100% agreed it was easy to apply.- 100% agreed it had a shine-free finish.- 93% agreed it felt lightweight on skin",

My skin is combo but you wouldnt have gotten that impression with how cakey and greasy it looked after only and hour. My face also started to break out within 30 minutes of wearing it. Horrible formula no matter how you apply it. Do NOT recommend. It is a scam in my opinion."

Nice pump that allows you to dispense as much or as little product as you want, so you don’t waste. Formula: Definitely buildable full coverage! Natural matte finish. I thought this product sat really well on the oilier parts of my face surprisingly. However, it did noticeably cling to my dry spots and I did experience some pilling if I was not careful about skin prep beforehand (really letting my moisturizer soak in prior to application). It set itself down and felt lightweight on the skin. Makes you look perfected from far away, but looks a bit rough up close by accentuating dryness."
