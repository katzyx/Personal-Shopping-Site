Then they created a collection of sophisticated and unique fragrances using just those. All Henry Rose fragrances are EWG Verified, Cradle to Cradle Certified, and Leaping Bunny Certified Cruelty-Free...This Set Contains:- 3 x 50ml/ 1.7oz Body Sprays in Mustang Sally, Blonde Barry, and Boys of Summer",

	"how_to_use": "Suggested Usage:.-Fragrance is intensified by the warmth of your own body. Apply in the creases of your knees and elbows for a longer-lasting, stronger scent..-After applying, avoid rubbing or dabbing skin. This breaks down the fragrance, causing it to wear off more quickly..-If you prefer placing fragrance on your wrists, be sure to reapply after frequent handwashing, as this tends to rinse off the scent..-Replace fragrance after 12 months. Expired perfumes more than a year old lose the integrity of the original scent.",

			"review_text": "I’m honestly surprised no one has reviewed the Henry Rose Mini Body Spray Set yet! With the sale and the extra 20% off, it’s such a good deal. I loved my first set so much that I bought a second one—just in case I use it up too quickly.  Boy of summer is my go-to in the evening before bed, and Blonde Barry and Mustang Sally is perfect for mornings at work or going out for brunch. They’re so subtle and airy, never overpowering. You get a nice, light scent, but it’s not something that’ll bother people.  I really dislike strong fragrances—sometimes they feel sticky and overwhelming, like someone is covering up something. But these sprays are the opposite: clean, fresh, light, comforting and super sophisticated. Not too sweet, not too much of anything—just perfectly balanced.  I’m also super picky when it comes to scents, and even ones I like can make me nauseous during mid-day. But this one doesn’t bother me at all. My husband and kids (who are toddlers) love it too. My kids always tell me, “Mommy, you smell so nice,” and I love knowing it’s safe for them to be around. My husband, who hates strong perfumes, is also a fan. Win-win in my house!  The sleek, minimal packaging is a bonus—it’s light and great for travel. I really hope they come out with more scents in the body spray 50ml size and gift sets. For now, this is hands-down my favorite holiday cosmetic find!"
