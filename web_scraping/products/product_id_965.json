			"review_text": "5/5 I love the lip balm, and I'll be buying that again. I do feel like it makes my lips more hydrated and plump. It has the right amount of slip and staying power for me. It also holds up well in the tube in the heat (so far). I wouldn't say it's my favorite balm though. It does have a feel to it on the lips, and I prefer to not feel my lip products at all except for that hydrating wet feel. However, it is the only truly plumping balm in a chapstick delivery system, which is my preferred method of application plus the plumping I desperately need and hardly anyone does both. 3/5 Stars on the lip gloss. It has a thick feel on the lips that I can't get over. I feel like I get bum ring lips as it starts to soak in/dry up. However, I do appreciate the glass lip look as well as the plumping effect it gives me. It's not a burning, it is a cooling plump, and it is definitely more than the lip balm. I do have 2 major issues with the packaging though... 1) There's hardly any actual product in the tube. I was able to use it literally a handful of times before it was gone. That's just disrespectful. 2) Sooooo much product comes out on the doe foot that I feel like it gets all over the component and all up in my mouth because I unintentionally apply too much. That's just rude."

The gloss smooths out lines as advertised and has a nice cooling affect (nothing extreme or tingly). Even bought another color of the gloss before I looked more into it. I see some saying the balm is hard and it is more stiff than a Carmex but I like it. Application is more deliberate, can‚Äôt overdo it, more matte and natural finish that lasts.

It had a slight fruity smell which I really enjoyed. The lip plump was also really amazing and I was so glad to get it in the set (it is full size). I was hesitant to buy it separately though because all the reviews had said you don‚Äôt get much in the container which is probably going to be true. But the deal you are basically get two for the price of  one. It was a great lip oil/plump. It did not burn or tingle really bad, it was just sort of a cooling sensation. It made my lips so glossy and moisturized, I absolutely loved the two paired together. I think I‚Äôm going to order another set while the sale is still going on."
