It works well for maybe the first couple of minutes but dries down quickly and becomes sticky. The stickiness makes it difficult to do much else and reapplying doesn't help - it just becomes thicker and stickier. Has a not so pleasant taste as well. Needless to say this kind of killed the mood. Don't know what to do with the rest of the bottle and it kills be that I paid so much for it. Definitely recommend buying the smallest bottle before you make a commitment."

Usually, the water-based ones I have used are sticky, too thick (reducing friction), and leave a residue. This aloe-based lube is pretty much skincare and leaves the skin moisturized. The viscosity isn't too thick and feels great. However, you do need to reapply as most water-based lubes dry out. This mixes well with reapplication and you're not left with old bits.

The use of aloe means that the lube itself is very moisturizing, and not sticky at all. After use there is no intense cleaning as it is absorbed into the skin.  There is also no smell, and the texture is very smooth and lasts a long time before more is needed. Definitely one of the most versatile and easy lubes, plus who doesn‚Äôt want to be moisturized?"
