I really loved the texture of the oil for my belly and I just finished the baby cream (my son is now 2 months old) he has a sensitive skin & red irritated cheeks and the baby cream worked fine on him. On the other side so did not like the purple cream tube, it did not smell good at all. Would definitely buy again the oil and the baby cream soon :)"

I can't say whether it reduces/helps with stretch marks yet as I'm still growing, but it is a godsend for the itchy skin and general irritation."

			"review_text": "I purchased this set after I had my baby, the stretch mark cream lasted about a month and the oil lasted about 6 weeks and I used it once a day. I am nervous to use the face cream on a newborn so I use it on my 4 year old who has sensitive skin and did not have a reaction. I would repurchase the oil and I liked the texture and did see an improvement in the areas that were applied. I had to pull out the dropper in order to get all of the product out as the dropper does not reach to the bottom of the glass bottle. The cream applied “okay” to my skin but I you also have to pump a lot of the cream to cover the areas. I wish the bottle for the cream was translucent to see how much product is left as the bottle feels light and it did not seem like there was product in there (obviously there was) so it was hard to tell when someone would need to repurchase or running low. I like the design of the face cream you don’t have to hold the product in one hand and pour the product in the other, essentially you can use one hand with this product. Overall like the name of this box, it is a good discovery set to try the products."

			"review_text": "I'm honestly very happy with the sizes in this set, its been about 3 weeks and I still have product left! The face cream helps with the red irritation my son gets on his face and my stomach is way more hydrated now. I can tell that the more I use the product the more hydrated my skin stays, I'm 32 weeks pregnant with many stretch marks from my past 3 pregnancies' so I can't say anything yet about how its reduces the look of stretch marks but it defiantly helps me not feel itchy! I will defiantly be purchasing the full size of all three products and trying them out for a longer duration to see how it helps after baby comes too!"
