I have matur(ing) skin that has decided to become oily (used to be dry) with occasional breakouts.  I bought the sample size which lasts about a week or so. It leaves my skin soft and clear."

			"review_text": "I wasn’t sure if this set would work for me as my skin can be very sensitive, but I did a gradual shift and have been pleasantly surprised.   The face wash was gentle but effective and left my skin feeling clean. If I wore makeup that day I did need to use a cleansing brush to lift it all, but it did leave my face clean in the end. Initially, I was unsure about the texture of the moisturizer gel but after a few weeks I noticed one day that my dry patches had shrunk and the rest of my face was baby soft. The spot cream I only used sparingly and can’t say for sure that it made a difference but it didn’t hurt and my skin did settle fairly soon after using it.   Overall, a good set for everyday use and the moisturizer gel is the star for combo skin like mine."

			"review_text": "Unfortunately this set is not for me. The spot treatment broke me out terribly! I applied it to 2 pimples, and I woke up the next day with a cluster of pimples in the area that I applied the product. Made my breakout so much worse. The face wash is nice, but it doesn't foam and it's not great for makeup removal. The gel cream wasn't for me. It contributed to my breakouts and made my forehead break out (I never get breakouts there)... Since I stopped using this set and returned it, my skin has completely cleared up. Also, the quantity of product is really not worth the price."

			"review_text": "If I could give the Skinfix Acne+ Triple Threat Set with Salicylic Acid (BHA) + Niacinamide with B-L3™ a million stars, I would. This product is nothing short of miraculous.  I've struggled with acne for years, trying countless products with disappointing results. But the Acne+ Triple Threat Set has completely transformed my skin. Not only has it cleared my acne completely, but it does so without drying out my skin—a common issue with many acne treatments.  What truly sets this set apart is its ability to create the perfect barrier for makeup applications. No more worrying about my makeup clogging pores or causing breakouts. With this set, my skin feels smooth, hydrated, and ready for flawless makeup every time.  I can't emphasize enough how much of a game-changer this product has been for me. It's eliminated clogged pores, prevented breakouts, and given me the clear, radiant skin I've always dreamed of.  If you're struggling with acne or clogged pores, I HIGHLY recommend giving the Skinfix Acne+ Triple Threat Set a try. It's a true miracle product that delivers on its promises and then some."

He loves weight of Skin Barrier repairing gel and so far the new formulation seems to be working well, He even tells his friends about Skinfix! Thanks!"
