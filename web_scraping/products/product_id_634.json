			"review_text": "I was on the hunt for a good primer and came across this one by Guerlain. While it does come with an above average price tag, it was so worth the smoothness it provided for my makeup. My skin is often dull and in need of a moisturizer look - this primer helped to achieve just that! There was a nice glowy finish to it. Highly recommended to those who need a nice glowy finish to their daily routine."

			"review_text": "This product was my own purchase and not given to me by anyone. My skin is fair, sensitive, and prone to dryness and as I creep up on 50, has quite a few fine lines.  I first fell in love with this primer during a trip to Sephora.  A Guerlain sales associate had me try it (along with the Advanced Youth Watery oil which is lovely), and I was on the fence about buying it due to the hefty price tag.  Several months later, I decided to treat myself and ordered the serum. Great decision!  First, I love the packaging and the look of the serum itself.  It's one of the few products I like to leave out on display due to its prettiness factor. It looks so glamorous on the vanity table!  The smell is light and very delicate,  It's a bit more perfumy than any other primer I have tried before but I don't mind it. The product pumps out very nicely and a little seems to go a long way. When I first put it on, it felt thick and sticky but it quickly dried to a nice finish that I could work with.  My makeup up went on seamlessly and stayed looking beautiful all day.  I also like that I can wear it alone and it gives my skin a luminous dewy glow that has long since been lost! I would recommend this lovely Guerlain product."

Feels like the foundation is going onto my face and being held in place. PLUS, it has great skin care ingredients. Works SO well with the Guerlain Le Teint. I just bought another bottle and although that did hurt my wallet a bit, I KNOW I'm getting a really good product. It kind of sucks that it does not last longer .... but you only need 1 pump. I think this is going to be the primer I stick with! `"

It makes my foundation so skin like and never thick looking. I’m obsessed. It lasts a really long time as well. At least a year for me personally. You don’t need a lot. It’s literally perfect in every way. Don’t be afraid of fragrance if it has never bothered you. The scent is immediate and dissipates quickly. I’m a licensed esthi with sensitive skin and this has never broke me out or bothered me in any way. $85 is a lot to justify but I save up points, etc. once again it lasts a lot longer than others I’ve used. It’s fabulous. Can’t recommend it enough. And I’m not a high end type of person. My absolute FAVORITE blush, bronzers and contours are $3. But I’m telling you this primer is worth every penny. I NEEEEEED IT (SpongeBob water episode when he’s in Sandy’s enclosure, that’s how bad you need it)"

I love the simplicity of the bottle and how it shows all the gold flakes.  But for the product itself, it didn't really work for me as well as i thought it would. The application is lovely, it's very lightweight and easy to apply. The only con is that it's not hydrating  enough and the flakes didn't really do anything when it comes to the finish. It had a little bit of shimmer but it wasn't really noticeable.  I would say it is a splurge and it's very pretty to display on your vanity but it's not something i would add on my regular makeup routine."

The packaging and bottle look sleek and high-end, while the gold flecks floating inside add an extra touch of beauty. Even the product itself is gorgeous to look at!  The primer has a gentle scent that makes the application process feel even more glamorous. What I loved most about it is the texture - it's incredibly smooth and non-sticky, which makes it easy to apply and blend seamlessly with a damp beauty sponge. It creates a perfect base for foundation, providing a flawless canvas for my makeup.  I used this primer with the Guerlain Terracotta Le Teint Fluid Foundation, and they paired together perfectly. The primer helped me achieve a smooth and uniform finish on my skin, and it extended the wear time of the foundation, which normally doesn't last me all day. With this primer, my foundation looked great from morning until evening, without any noticeable wear and tear.  I've used other Guerlain products before, and I'm always impressed by their quality. This primer is no exception - I would definitely recommend it to others and even repurchase it myself. It's worth noting that I received this primer from Influenster for free in exchange for my honest review, but my positive experience shows that it's a product worth investing in."

Firstly, the consistency of the product was quite thin and wet, which made it difficult to apply evenly on my skin. Additionally, there were unnecessary gold flakes suspended throughout the primer, which did not serve any functional purpose and felt gimmicky.  Furthermore, the primer did nothing to improve the appearance or texture of my skin. It did not blur my pores or smooth out my complexion, and it did not make my foundation last longer. In fact, I found that my makeup actually looked worse when I used this primer.  To make matters worse, the scent of the product was unpleasant. It smelled like a combination of hand sanitizer and Guerlain perfume, which was overwhelming and unpleasant to me.  Overall, I would give the Guerlain Parure Gold 24K Primer a 2 out of 5 stars. The thin, wet consistency, unnecessary gold flakes, and lack of efficacy left me disappointed. Additionally, the unpleasant scent made it a product that I would not want to use again."

After application my skin feels tacky and sticky - not silky smooth like other primers. I applied the guerlain foundation on top and noticed right away that you can see nore texture than normal - i don't know if that is from the primer or foundation.

The pump works smoothly distributing just the right amount of product.   I have combination skin, oily in the T-zone but dry everywhere else. I applied this over my usual skincare routine. Goes on smoothly, it has a bit of sticky feel at first but it goes away once it is fully absorb. The smaller gold flakes absorbed right into the skin, but the bigger ones just sat on top on the skin. Kinda looked weird to have a few random gold flakes on my face.   After application I noticed my skin feels more hydrated, looks plumper, smoother, more even and radiant. Saids you can wear it alone with or without makeup. I liked this on my skin without make up, gave me a healthy natural glow. But it didn't do much for me as a primer, didn't help with my pores or fine lines when my makeup was applied. I tired it with my usual liquid foundation, and tired it with the new Guerlain Terracotta Le Teint - Healthy Glow Natural Perfection Foundation, which was also gifted. Both foundation when on smooth at first but as I worked it in with my beautyblender, it dried and cling on to my fine lines, wrinkles, pores and dry skin. It might be because there is no silicone/dimethicone in this primer? My make up did stay on all day and didn't transfer. However I think this would work better as a primer for people who do not have problematic skin. I prefer primer which help blur out my imperfections.   This primer has a strong honey/floral fragrance that stays on even after application. It is too overwhelming for my liking. I do however love that this has 98% naturally derived ingredients and paraben free. I would still use this on non makeup days for extra boost of hydration and radiance, but not as a primer. I would recommend this if your concerns are hydration and radiance and you do not have sensitivity to scent."

The primer has a gentle scent that really adds a glamorous feel to the application process.  The texture of the primer is great - it isn't sticky or tacky at all. It glides on smoothly without leaving any residue and provides a wonderful base for foundation. It is super easy to apply with a damp beauty sponge.  I used it beneath the Guerlain Terracotta Le Teint Fluid Foundation and they paired together perfectly. It allowed me to get a wonderfully smooth and uniform finish on the foundation and helped to extend the wear right to the end of the day. Normally I never feel like my foundation looks 100% by the end of a long day but using this, I felt my skin still looked great at nighttime when I went to remove my makeup.  This is not the first Guerlain product I have used and I am impressed by the quality every single time - I would definitely recommend this primer!

The bottle is beautifully designed and has a really lovely weight to it. The product feels nice and I definitely did notice my foundation wore longer when I had this on. For reference my skin is dehydrated, which means that even though it’s super dry it also gets quite oily. One thing to keep in mind is that this primer is quite fragranced. It does go away, but if your skin is sensitive to fragrance it might not be the best choice for you. Now for the “womp womp” news:  yes it made my foundation last longer, but my super inexpensive elf primer performed just as well. The takeaway: if you want something bougie to feel luxurious every so often, or if it is worth it to have the Guerlain primer, absolutely you do you!! If you prefer to save a little I’d say spend on the Guerlain foundation and buy a drugstore primer to go with it. There’s definitely no denying that this one is beautiful!"

First of all, when you get item, the first thing you will notice is the very luxurious looking packaging. As soon as you open it and take out the primer, you will notice the packaging gets even better. A heavy glass bottle with a gold cap – it is so beautiful and give you a very extravagant feeling especially with the 24K Gold Flakes throughout the glass bottle.   I really also appreciated the pump style bottle – which is my preferred style of packaging, as its easier to store AND can control the amount of product.   As soon as you use the primer, it has a gel like consistency that just glides on your skin so smoothly.  It not only primes your skin beautifully for your makeup products, but it moisturizes, hydrates and gives your face a very subtle glow. It did not make my face feel oily or greasy whatsoever.   I let the primer dry/absorb into my skin for a few minutes and then I paired it with the Guerlain Terracotta Le Teint Fluid Foundation and the primer did it’s job by offering me a really good base for my makeup to sit on.   Highly recommended primer and look forward to purchasing this in the future!   #incentivized #voxbox #influenster #honestopinion #gotitfree #gotitforfree #guerlain #gold24kprimer #makeup #primer"

I have combination skin and some fine lines around my eyes and on my forehead and it did not break me out, and did smooth out those areas that foundation can settle into.

The heavy glass bottle with gold cap and pump, paired with the suspended gold flakes throughout the primer, makes this a beautiful product to leave out on the vanity. The consistency of the primer is smooth and light, not like the silicone feel of other primers that feel heavy on the skin. The primer feels sticky as it is drying, so I made sure to wait for it to completely dry before putting my foundation over it. I have combination skin and felt like there isn’t a ton of hydration in this primer for my drier areas but it still creates a great solid base for foundation. I did not find this primer smoothing to the more textured areas of my skin unfortunately. I paired this up with Guerlain Terracotta Le Teint liquid foundation and was amazed that there was no movement in the foundation over the day, none of the foundation settled in my fine lines or creases, win!! The primer is scented, so that may not be your thing. The gold flakes are left on your skin after you apply which I didn’t love, but once dry, they can be brushed off easily or just covered with foundation. Overall this primer is not quite like any of the others I’ve used, but it does the job wonderfully."

After using the product consistently for a few weeks, I am ready to share my thoughts on its efficacy, radiance-boosting properties, and compatibility with my skin type. The primer comes in an elegant 30ml gold bottle with a pump dispenser, which ensures easy and hygienic application. The packaging is not only visually appealing but also feels luxurious to hold.The primer has a lightweight, gel-like consistency that spreads effortlessly on the skin. The gold particles are finely milled, which prevents any chunkiness or grittiness in the texture. I used the recommended one to two pumps of the product and applied it onto clean, moisturized skin. The primer glided on smoothly and absorbed quickly, leaving a subtle, radiant sheen. The gold particles were not overly visible on my black skin, but they provided a soft-focus effect that helped blur imperfections. the Guerlain Parure Gold 24K Radiance Booster Perfection Primer did not cause any irritation or breakouts. It also managed to add some hydration to my skin, which is a plus for those with dry skin. However, if you have extremely dry skin, you might still need additional moisturization. Overall, I am impressed with the product. It provided a subtle, radiant glow, added hydration, and helped my makeup last longer without causing any irritation to my sensitive skin"

It feels hydrating on dry skin and creates a plump & slightly tacky skin surface for foundation to sit on. It gives a healthy and radiant glow to the skin without making you look oily.  This product also has a very noticeable scent to it. My skin is quite sensitive to fragrance, but after using this product multiple times, I’ve had no breakouts or bad reactions.  I’ve noticed that some chunkier pieces of gold are sometimes noticeable on the skin, I don’t really mind a glittery look, but I’ve had 1-2 gold specks that I’ve had to remove from my face because they were a little too noticeable. All and all, if you’re on a budget, I don’t think you absolutely needs this in your makeup collection. However, if you wanna treat yourself to a more luxurious makeup experience, I do recommend getting this."

A small amount goes a long way, but even with a small amount it was still a little bit too sticky, I kept trying to blend it in but as it warmed up it became even more sticky - the trick is to just leave it alone for a few minutes before applying the next product to the face. The gold specks are not quite evenly distributed, so I found that in different light you could see little specks here and there. Otherwise the primer filled in my pores evenly and provided a good base for foundation and bronzer without them feeling like I am caking on products. I have tried other better primers, so I am not sure that this one would become an every day product, more a splurge product for special occasions when I want more product on my face! There is a light, almost floral scent to it which was also lovely! Thank you Influenster for sending me this #freeproduct in exchange for my honest opinion!"

It has a lightweight but hydrating gel texture that goes on smoothly, while filling in pores and evening out texture.  There is a very slight bit of tackiness to it after applied, so it is best to wait and let it soak in for a minute or two before going over top with your foundation. It does not have that silicone feel like other primers on the market. There is a noticeable scent that is soft and floral, but I really like it. Once applied, there are a few flecks of gold flakes that are left over on my face, but not enough that it bothers me with the appearance or affects the overall look of my makeup. I would definitely classify this as a luxury item, and a great option if you are looking to splurge on a nice product! This product was sent to me in exchange for my honest review."

It did not cause any irritation or side effects on my skin.  only the gold pieces were not evenly distributed on my skin and it had a flaky effect on my face.  So it did glow under the light.  I don't know, maybe this is normal, but it seemed strange to me as I don't use scaly products on my face.It can be great for those who use colorful and sequined makeup products.

However, I’m not sure how I feel about the gold flecks. I applied the primer and noticed I had tons of gold flecks/sparkles all over my face. I started to panic because it wasn’t like a glowy look, it was straight sparkle. The texture of the actual primer was very pleasant. It seemed a little silicone like but nothing heavy like a pore filling primer. It was a touch hydrating as well. It spread evenly on my face. Once I applied the foundation you no longer could see the gold flecks which I enjoyed. I wouldn’t have used it again if you could. I applied my foundation with a beauty blender and it went on well until I got to my neck. I noticed the product caused a little bit of piling on my skin. If you just dab with a blender you should be fine, but it might give you problems otherwise. I had paired it with a foundation from the same brand so I would expect it to mesh together well. So at the end of the day this wasn’t my favourite primer but it also wasn’t bad. It could be someone’s favourite but I can’t say I would purchase again. #freeproduct"

Made my skin look so plumped and my fine lines disappeared just like after i get hydro facials. The gold flakes also disappeared and made my skin glowy. The serum absorbed quickly and my foundation looked so good all day! Pro tip: mix it in with your foundation to make it more sheer and glowing. I absolutely love it and I’m hooked!"

Someone else compared it to gel hand sanitizer, that would be accurate. The gold flecks disappear on contact, so I didn’t notice any residue from those. The main thing I observed with this primer is that it’s very sticky and takes a long time to dry. Longer than a silicone primer. I got fed up of waiting after a while and ended up applying Charlotte Tilbury Magic Cream on top as my makeup base. My skin looked great once I applied my powder foundation, nice and plump. I repeated the same process with La Mer SPF50 sunscreen on top, also works nicely without pilling. To me it behaves more like a skincare serum than an actual primer. I will finish the deluxe mini I got in my Sephora Luxe box, but I will stick to my beloved Murad Invisiblur Perfecting Shield SPF30 primer. L’Or Gold Radiance is not transformative enough for me to make the switch, and the price is a little obscene for what you get. JMHO."

			"review_text": "Boy did this improved the look & longevity of my foundation! I have very oily skin, like crisco oily with large pores, & live in humid Florida. Since it’s a water base primer I used a water base foundation ( Estée Lauder DW) followed by LM setting powder & NYX setting spray and my foundation went on so smooth with no dry patches or textured skin, most of my pores were covered and my largest pores on my cheeks were noticeably smaller (no primer can make large pores disappear completely). It’s also great at keeping oil at bay. I usually get oily 30min-1hr after applying makeup & go through 7-8 sheets of blotting paper a day, 1 sheet per hour. This primer held back my oils for at least 4hrs after application, & even then I looked more glowy then greasy, which is a huge improvement for me & I no longer feel so self conscious about my oily skin. Now I only blot once or twice a day and my foundation stays put and looks ridiculously fresh. I also wear glasses & noticed tht my foundation doesn’t shift or disappear anymore! I would say it performs similarly to the milk makeup primer, just with a more watery consistency like hand sanitizer lol, but it has that grip & I have to admit the end result is just a little better than the Milk primer. That being said you can go for the more affordable option cause this is pretty expensive. But if your curious & have skin like me, definitely get your hands on a sample. If you like the finish & can afford to splurge, go for it! I DO NOT regret buying this!"

So I tried my Lancome, my Tarte, my Clinique, my Nars, my Urban Decay, my Make Up For Ever and my Laura Mercier foundations to make sure it wasn't a high end fluke. Fast perfection with every last one. So if you are struggling with foundation application due to dry, flaky, cracky skin try a sample!! I'll happily pay for this overpriced, pretty, alcohol primer to not have to go through what I've been dealing with for the last 2+ years. FYI, I'm 41 years old."

Ladies, if you’re not aware, alcohol (ethanol, isopropyl, alc denat, methanol) may *feel* okay in short term, but long term will wear down your natural moisture barrier, and can cause breakouts because of this, because it dries your skin out which creates overactive oil production (ie, your face is trying to recover). It also can accelerate the aging process, so you will get wrinkles faster! This primer is straight a JOKE for saying it’s hydrating, because long term it causes damage. If you bought this, stop using it. Please PLEASE look at your skincare ingredients list, there are so many primers that are a fraction of the price and will actually benefit you long term. Stay safe xx"

Secondly, my very light, water based foundation seemed to be more drawn to my wrinkles and called out every imperfection in my skin. It could be my skin care routine prior to application, but obviously, why change an entire routine for a primer.   On dry prone skin, I would consider this to be drying, especially given the 3rd ingredient is alcohol. Not, that IMHO, there is anything wrong with alcohol, but defeats my normal dewy skin approach."

When I started using this one, it not only formed a slight wrinkle I have in between my eyebrows from squinting, but it made my make up last 4-5 more hours than my other primers. I do get a tad but oily using it but it doesn’t bother me due to have dry skin normally."

It’s supposed to smell luxurious, so they’ve given it a highly perfumed scent.  But it’s too much.  If you’re sensitive to scents, this will be one you should avoid.  I feel like the scent is something a kindly Grandma would wear.  It’s performance doesn’t match the price tag in my books.  Perhaps if you do not have any textural irregularities, and your skin is already pretty flawless.  Otherwise, this is a hard pass in my books.  I bought this under the recommendation of Tati and while I love her channel, makeup and skin care is so individualized, and it seems to work amazing for her, but for me...this was returned after about two weeks.  Not worth they astronomical price tag for the performance it gives.    I will say the packaging is beautiful and who isn’t in love with the gold flecks immersed in this primer?  It’s a total luxurious experience, but one that is more about the feeling of using a $80 primer than actually the results it gives."

I am a single mother, on one income and have three kids, it was the stupidest thing I have ever done.. AND I LOVE IT! Never has my makeup looked so flawless AND lasted all day. It smoothes over my face and although it doesn't have dymethicone to fill in your pores, I feel like my pores are less visible. Sometimes I'll do my makeup and it will look good from afar, but when I get up close I notice my makeup looks a little blotchy, you could see my dry patches, and in some areas my foundation cakes up. That doesn't happen with this foundation! If I had to choose one makeup item that is most important it would be this one. It has helped me with my confidence, because I no longer have to worry if I look like crap when I am talking to a person! I highly recommend it. Yes it is expensive, but one pump is all you need and it is lasting me forever it seems like. I will definitely be reordering. I am a believer that you get what you pay for.. And this is proof! #holygrail"

I don't feel it doing the lifting and for me, it's not a questionable, did it do something, did it not? No, for me, it's a definite, yes, my face is lifted. My jaw is uneven, so a part of my face is more flat looking, that's how I know it's lifting, because that side of my face definitely looks much more lifted. It's great! However, I'm not sure the ingredients in this are very good. Especially for dry skin. Now, I'm no expert by any means when it comes to that sort of thing, so I could be wrong."

A little goes along way and seeing as this primer is pretty expensive, that’s a good thing. There are real gold flecks in the primer and they dissolve when the primer is applied to the skin.

Don't purchase this one unless that's the case for you. I found my face did get a little shiny when wearing it. Tati said on her review that she felt tingling & tightening. I didn't feel any difference whatsoever, however, that is not one of my skin concerns, so maybe it does have a tightening effect for others. I didn't feel like it did much to minimize the appearance of pores. The texture is very pleasant, not heavy or tacky at all. It doesn't have the usual silicone-like texture I'm more used to with other primers, which may be why I saw no difference with my pores. I will continue to use it and do recommend it for anyone with dull, dry, or aging skin who is more concerned with moisture & glow."

I was shocked. The side of my face with this on was actually lifted. Nothing outrageous but enough for me to notice and made my face look more vibrant and flawless. The side with the smashbox primer on it’s own showed more flaws and wasn’t as plump and glowy. I was finally convinced and purchased the full size. Only reason for knocking off one star is because I feel it is definitely overpriced for a primer and the gold flakes feel so extra. That being said it is Guerlain so it’s gonna be pricy."

I thought my makeup went on fine without primer but this made it melt into my skin with a beautiful glow. And I still have that same glow and perfect makeup after a long workday and walking around the city. I hate that I love it so much. Like everyone else, I never dreamt of spending $74 on a primer. That is more than my Chanel foundation! Nonetheless, I ended up purchasing the full size. I told myself that it's makeup and skincare in one. And I'm hopeful that it will last a long time since a little goes a long way. My skin is combo and this does help control my oil. It does fill my pores if I layer it a little more. And the old flecks dissolve and may be the reason for the glow."

About the primer, it really does lift and smooth out the complexion for a flawless canvas to apply makeup on. I use the Dior Dreamscape Totale also and that was always my favorite. But the gold flecks on the L'or do produce a glow from within when you apply make up over it. I use a tinted primer or a bb cream. The only foundation I ever use is the UD PRESSED POWDER foundation and I prefer it under my eyes or as a nontour. So I never fully cover my primer.

			"review_text": "I am currently waiting for my second order of this to arrive because I ran out of the first one. Now, I love luxury items, but for the most part I really only buy luxury makeup that I'm obsessed with. I had high hopes the first time around because of all the Youtubers I watch who were absolutely raving about it (and I wanted to feel super classy and boogie, too, I'll admit). To be totally honest, at first I was a little surprised because it wasn't as thick as I thought it'd be. It's sort of like a hand sanitizer's consistency, like a water-infused gel. You see little gold flakes in every single pump and even tho I would go crazy and use 2-3 for my whole face and neck, you TRULY only need 1, 2 at the absolute maximum, but really one will do the job, just apply it quickly because it does absorb very fast.   Even using 2x too much, if not more, literally everyday, sometimes admittedly twice in one day (I was crazy and I wanted my friends to try it too) the bottle still lasted me about three months, so I'd say if you conserve you can easily get 6 out of this bottle.  Did I feel the insane lifting and tigthtening everyone's talking about at first? Not entirely.  But I did notice that applying it in an upward motion starting at my neck and working up to my forehead made a big difference in the firmness and tightness of my skin.   But what REALLY SOLD ME on this product and is the reason I am REPURCHASING it is actually what I noticed after I ran out. Like I said, I used it obsessively every single day and I got used to it. So when I stopped using it, I realized that my foundation wasn't lasting as long and wasn't looking as flawless, no matter what other primer I used, or founation, or how I applied it, or how good my skincare was. Finally, I had to admit to myself that it was this extremely expensive item that made my makeup flawless and stay on throughout most of the day.   Sorry for such a long review, I literally never write these, but I also literally never re-purchase luxury items unless they're worth it. So the last thing I'll say is, I know it seems like an insane purchase, but think about how much money you'll save from not having to buy primer after primer when this really does work its magic.   My advice: The perfect combination that I can NOT beat right now (even after trying this primer with Dior's Capture Totale which is 83 dollars) is GUERLAIN L'OR PRIMER and DIOR AIRFLASH FOUNDATION (I am not ultra fair, but fair, and 202 CAMEO is my perfect shade and I'm telling you, nothing works better with one another than these two products. I literally wish I could like buy samples of them both and send them to everyone reading this because it really is that freaking flawless.   Okay, I'm done ranting. But if you're on the fence, just do it. I really really don't think you'll regret it. And if you have it and are underwhelmed, try a little test and use this with another primer or no primer on each side of your face with the exact same foundation/concealer/etc. I'm telling you you'll see a difference, if not immediately, by the end of the day.   Hope this helps!!!! LONG LIVE THE MAKEUP <3"

This made my makeup last all throughout an 8 hour workday. I applied my makeup at 6:30 am and I didn't have the need to blot until 5:30 pm. My skin had a very slight luminosity but did not look oily. My skin looked smooth and radiant. Not oily but radiant with a Demi matte finish. If you have dry skin and you are looking for an extremely luminous glow. I don't think this product will do it for you. If you have Normal/Combo/Oily skin and want a slight luminous finish while still looking matte/Demi matte, this product is for you.

So I got the chance to visit a big Sephora that carried it, my eyes glazed over, and before I knew it my debit card was out and I was bringing home the fanciest primer I've ever owned. I'm in love. My make up looks like it was just applied all.day.long! It really does make my pores look non existent and my skin a little more youthful. I'm a little annoyed that I fell in love for such a pricey product but a little goes a long way and it should last me a long time. This is a splurge. Are there other primers that work wonders at keeping make up on longer, sure! But if you're in the market for a primer that helps make up longevity and provides some skin appearance improvement this is a good one. It's not a long term skin improvement product as far as I can tell. But I love what it does provide while wearing it. It hasn't broken my sensitive skin out or caused any issues. It doesn't feel heavy after it dries down and has foundation over it. It doesn't make your make up feel cakey either."

The over all finish, before foundation application, is a smoothed, healthy plumped up look. I can see anyone who already has great skin being able to wear this under BB creams, or just on its own. It's very fresh, and illuminating, but not pinky toned like its counter part, Meteorites Perles, this primer is clear.  I think it gives the illusion of lifting the skin at the start, but hopefully in time it will benefit my skin w use.

I bought the full size using a gift card (partially) as this was the only way I felt I could really justify buying a primer that costs so much. I don't know if I would repurchase with my own hard earned cash in the future. I do love it though (star docked for crazy price tag). PLEASE NOTE* the gold isn't meant to make your face shimmer!

And even with the oil starting to peek through later on in the day, it's still not the oil slick that I'm used to seeing. While I don't feel any tingling sensation after applying it like others have experienced it really does seem to lift my face and make my makeup go on smoother. I still use Benefit Porefessional, however, to fill in my large pore areas. I love how my makeup looks throughout the day when using this and, at this point, I would definitely re-purchase!"

I like this for the summer as an alternative to heavy moisturizing cream. Maybe the less you use & the more you rub it in, it'll work better. Worked for me! The smell was pretty & I caught whiffs when I'd turn my head. It didn't irritate at all. It was a light scent. Now, the not so good.....It slightly tightened. It didn't fill a lot of my fine lines. It also didn't make my pores look smaller. I can buy a product for my pores, that's ok. This little sample lasts over 6 months, so you'll have your bottle forever. Hence, the price.

I tried all-day makeup, night makeup, no-makeup look, etc. And I also tried, one day, using it only in half of my face. I have oily skin and saw some comments about it not being good for oily skin, but I didn't have this problem. My makeup (with YSL Le Teint Touche Éclat) lasted about 7-8 hours. For the q/2 face day, it was the same as without the primer, so it doesn't improve the lasting effect of the foundation. However, the application of both foundation and concealer was slightly smoother, almost without need for buffering foundation in the end. Besides that, I noticed a subtle golden glow in my (light) skin. I thought it could be biased b/c I know about the product, so in the 1/2-face day, I asked my husband how was my makeup and he said good, but this side is different. Do you have two looks? I prefer this one.... It was the side with the primer.  Take into consideration I wear little foundation and almost never apply powder to set my makeup. I have oily skin and think powder, although helps to make the look last longer, can get cakey AND sometimes has the white-powder look in photos. So I try to avoid it."

I don't know whether the gold ingredient does a thing for my skin but the base does provide a terrific canvas for application of my liquid foundation. It's difficult to describe, but when applied and allowed to dry for a bit, it feels a bit tacky...don't be put off by this description, however. It holds my foundation (which I finish with powder) for my 12-hour work day (as long as I remember not to touch my face with my hands). I've used it with Guerlain Parure D'Lumiere foundation as well as my go to daily foundation, Giorgio Armani Lasting Silk. The two foundations are quite different in consistency (Armani being much thinner and almost watery in comparison to the Guerlain foundation), but the L'or base keeps both foundations from slipping or disappearing. I also find that it has made it easier to apply my Armani Lasting Silk foundation evenly (and I use my fingers to do this despite having tons of available brushes). I use two pumps of product to cover my entire face and lower chin line so the product quantity in this package will last quite a long time. For those of you who are all about the packaging, you won't be disappointed; it's classic Guerlain...lovely and heavy glass...lots of class. I'm more impressed by functional packaging. Having said this, the pump on this bottle works flawlessly so far; I don't know how it'll function when I'm reaching the end of the product inside. I actually bought my bottle at full price and recently purchased a second bottle because the L'or does do its job well, but II would only buy it a reasonable sale price, such as a VIB 20% discount sale. So I guess you can say that I'm happy with it but not deliriously so....I'm still hoping to find something that's a HG primer for me."

I finally got a sample of it in onthe of the summer samplers boxed set. I was so disappointed. It so thin and runny. The gold flakes didn't make any difference. There was no radiance or brightness. Nothing. And it wasn't that great at keeping my makeup in place either. On me, this was nothing more than a novelty. Check me out being like Paris Hilton with my gold primer! and that's about it."

This doesn't do the job of filling in fine lines that it claims to do, but it does seem to smooth the look of large pores and it leaves the skin with a lovely, soft glow without a lot of shimmer. It doesn't make liquid foundation hard to blend the way some primers do. It's pricey, but it will last forever - three small drops is enough to cover the whole face. I like it."

I never actually used a primer until about a year ago, and since then have tried many of them, but aside from increasing the longevity of my foundation by a bit, I've never seen any dire need for them. Add that to the fact that I'm a long-time acne sufferer, and the thought of putting yet more product on my skin was not a welcome one. Still, I found a primer and have been using it every day, and was never 100% thrilled; and then I tried this product. The difference is amazing! There is a marked change in the luminosity of my skin before I put on foundation (yes, even after the primer is dry) and when I apply concealer and foundation, it provides an amazingly smooth surface, even with my Smashbox Halo Powder Foundation; plus, it increases its staying power for the entire day. And it definitely creates that glow from the inside that all the beauty junkies rave about. To cut this before I ramble on too long, I love it, and although the price is pretty hefty for a primer, I'll probably grab a full-size once my sample is gone."

So I purchased the L'or Radiance Concentrate With Pure Gold Make-up Base primer, the Parure Extreme Luminous Extreme Wear Foundation, and Météorites Powder. I like for my make to work together, and this does. In the beginning I was really on the fence about the L'or Radiance Primer. First of all, when I received it, I think it may have been opened. The package was open in the box….I didn’t like that. Second, I am used to primers being a little oily or greasy to aid smooth application of the foundation. This didn’t do that. It wasn’t oily or greasy and I didn’t feel it helped my foundation go on. Only one or two flakes of gold came out….and they just sat on my face, looking like lonely glitter. I was pretty set on sending it back. Though with all three products my face did look great, and lasted all day! I am one of those girls who at night when I wash my face, I get off some eye makeup, but my foundation had disappeared hours ago. But was this the foundation or the primer…maybe the powder? Which of these made my makeup stay on all day? So I did an experiment, I used my makeup just as the day before, and skipped the primer. At the end of the day, my makeup was gone. This makes the product worth its weight in gold. I am keeping it. I love that I can go somewhere after work and not worry about reapplying makeup. I think it is a keeper!"

I've read a ton of reviews that rave about this product but, complain about the price. I understand that $70.00 is not a small sum of money however, this IS a Guerlain product. Most, if not all, of their products are pricey... It comes with the name.  With that said... On to the review:  The consistency of this product is very similar to that of a skincare serum. It's gel - like properties make it a dream to apply however, it is a tad bit runny so work fast. It absorbs relatively quickly and one pump is enough to cover the whole face. It smells of violets (which is Guerlain's signature cosmetics scent) but, quickly fades in about 5 - 10 minutes after initial application. It leaves a noticeable glow on the skin, even under heavy foundation. As for the 24 - carat gold flakes?! Well, they're made of finely milled particles that mix together with the gel when pumped. It also tightens the skin, so that large pores become less visible, without drying it out.  Side note: I'm in my early 20's so, I can't say much about fine lines and wrinkles. Sorry. =("

I swore off primers but when I saw that this is made with pure gold the leo in me had to try it! It has a gel like consistency (a little runny) and you can't actually see the gold when you apply it on your face. It does leave your face looking glowing and dewy and seems to have a slight tightening effect. It does not contribute to the oiliness either, actually it seems that it helps keep it at bay. Well done Guerlain!"
