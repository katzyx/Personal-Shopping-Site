It’s so convenient to use, and best of all, it doesn’t leave my hair feeling greasy. The oil itself is lightweight and absorbs quickly, leaving no residue, which is a huge plus for me. My hair feels noticeably shinier, more nourished, and the texture is softer and less frizzy."

It’s not super heavy but I definitely notice hair growth as I have a lot of little baby hairs growing out. My hair feels softer, especially when I use the post shower hair oil. A little goes a long way, I only need a few drops. I love this hair kit cause you get to try both amazing products and I love the little bottle for travel!"

I left it overnight and could feel that it moisturized my hair and scalp. I washed it out the next morning and could see the difference in condition of my hair.  The MahaMane Smooth and Shine hair oil was good for taming some of my flyaways and giving my finished hair some shine. Again, this had an amazing scent.  This set also contained a small sachet of Volumizing shampoo and conditioner.  I received this product for free in exchange for my honest opinion."

I think for your hair to be truly taken care of, both pre and post oils are super important. These two oils work on protecting, strengthening and overall making your hair shiner and more healthy.

Love it! Such a great gift for yourself or someone else. I have seen these products all over TikTok and couldn’t wait to try. I have long hair that is fine in texture. I love to use a hair oil before I shampoo to protect my hair follicles. Because I have such fine hair, I typically don’t use a hair oil on my scalp because it usually leaves me looking greasy. But since this one is designed to be washed out, I gave it a try! I left it on for about 10 minutes before my shower and it washed out easily with shampoo and did not look oily after I styled. I was impressed! I love the smooth and shine oil as well. I only apply it to my ends (again because of my fine hair) but it left them soft. So amazing that this oil also has heat protectant properties. I really love this set and would recommend!"
