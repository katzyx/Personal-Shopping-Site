			"review_text": "Are you kidding us! This was a big waste of $$ & for the price of these little bottles is a joke. The shampoo & conditioner did absolutely nothing for my dried, frizzy, limp hair & I love Oribe products & there's only enough conditioner for 2-3 washes for longer hair & the shampoo about 5-6 washes. I was really disappointed in this luxury hair product & in my eyes there's nothing luxurious about this line. Please fix the issues as it's not right for your customers. Thank you."

			"review_text": "I’ve been using these alchemy oribe products for the past four months, particularly the leave in serum treatment as a heat protector. I bought the holiday packaged travel set first and then repurchased full size because I liked how it felt on my thinning, aging, straight hair. Not too stripping nor too emollient. I do not understand these negative reviews that are complaining about the price or the size which are both clearly stated when you make the purchase or claiming that their hair is falling out. Hair falls out every day particularly noticeably when you’re washing your hair. I have not experienced, this and my hair has never looked better. ￼"
