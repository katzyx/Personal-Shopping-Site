			"review_text": "I loved the original formula for the winter months, but I wanted something matte for the summer.  Initially, I could not get the pigment properly incorporated, even after shaking the tube as vigorously as I could (as it said to do on the packaging).  It took about a week of use before the product came out normally.  The product also sat in my pores and the finish was uneven.  I finally managed to make this work by not using any gel skincare products (it pilled severely with them), continuing to shake the tube, putting a touch of smoothing primer over my pores, and then applying the Complexion Rescue to one area of the face at a time with a flat foundation brush.  I blended out any brush strokes with my fingertips.   The end result was exactly what I was looking for - a light coverage that kept excess oil at bay in the summer heat - but it took some work to get there."

I’m so glad I didn’t buy it upfront because I would definitely be returning it.   Like others have said, it is chalky and doesn’t apply evenly. I will say that when I did blend it in, my skin tone looked even and the coverage is the same as the old formula, although with a cakey finish. The first time I tried this, it sunk into and accentuated a couple of dry spots on my skin. A few hours later, they were noticeably flaky patches. Luckily I was working from home when I tested it, because it did not look good.   I can’t believe that Bare Minerals discontinued a beloved product and replaced it with this. How many people are going to buy a MATTE moisturiser in 2024?"
