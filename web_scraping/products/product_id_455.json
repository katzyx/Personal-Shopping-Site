It’s just filling the wrinkles with silicone which is what you can do with any silicone based makeup primer. I’ve gotten a bunch of samples of it and was really excited to try it since I have heard amazing reviews of the night serum. This may work for some if they love silicone makeup primers, I don’t so I will definitely not purchase this. Be careful with silicones if you have acne prone skin as well."

Purchased this along with perfectionist pro (instant filler) After the first use I could tell a difference. I’m excited to see how this works over the next 6 months. Either way, I’m definitely thankful I found something to at least help while I’m without the Xeomin/Botox.  A few hundred dollars isn’t a bad price, considering you get a good amount of product."

I only use it at night because I use other products during the day to control oil, but still have noticed a difference. I always let it sit for a few minutes before I apply a thicker night moisturizer. My skin always feels so soft in the AM. I will never use anything other serum again."

My skin has never been happier, looked,and felt better EL knocked it out of the park with this. I also use EL moisturizer after the revitalizing supreme+ global anti-aging. First time using that product absolutely perfect combination. This serum can easily be used as a primer not oiley at all so smooth feels really light and nice on skin. My skin absolutely soaks this up. Way to go EL I’m 39 and my skin has never looked and felt better."

It leaves your skin feeling a bit tight, which I get because it is called firming and lifting  I'm willing to try it for a bit longer to see if I get any results, We'll see."

Fine lines are definitely diminished, and my skin feels smooth. This wears very well under primer or makeup, but it also gives your skin a smooth look on its own. This is worth the splurge, sis."

One day for some reason I got it in my head that I needed to be using more natural products, silicone free and no fragrance blah blah blah. I convinced myself that the Estée Lauder that had never let me down was now bad for me. I’m almost 44 and I’ve had terrible skin for the last couple of years, spending tons of money at Sephora on “natural” brands. What a joke! Nothing works like this, and a few other tried and true things from Estée Lauder. I feel so dumb for straying. Estée Lauder for life!!! If you are reading this and debating the purchase, just buy it. The line is semi pricey, but your regimen will last a long time and the items are very reasonable considering the results you get!"

I budget for Botox this year and I don’t even need it! Extra vacation $$$$. Don’t get me wrong, this serum is stupid expensive. That said, 2nd huge bonus is that it makes your skin feel like silk after applying it. Sooooo smooth. Makeup goes on like a dream and it does not make me oily! I love this stuff. Besides the price I can say that it has one more negative, it takes a lot t cover my whole face. This little jar only lasted me a month and most serums that size last me 4-6.

As i said before, i find disturbing that this serum have such few reviews, it's one of the few serums that actually worked, and i am a beauty junkie, but this serum goes beyond all of them...  Let me tell you my story... 3 years ago i needed to change my serum, i was using The Regenarating serum by LaMer but suddenly i felt like they changed the formula, it was more watery and not really working abymore, so after doing my research as i always do i bought this and BOOM i used for a year and half straight, purchasing several botteles a year, since the 50 ml lasts like 4 months or a little more aprox. Well during that time, i HAD THE BEST SKIN OF MY LIFE, but, since i used other products i never really gave this serum the credit for my amazing skin. I use it in the eye area too, so i was using it in the whole face, so sadly, since i am a beauty junkie (not always is the best thing trust me) the new estee lauder serum, NEW DIMENSION came, and the list of ingredients was amazing so i decided to ask for a sampler, i got several ones, i loved it, so i thought i found a replacement for PERFECTIONIST... so i started using it, even in the eye area, at the beggining it was amazing, my skin looked amazing, plumpy and healthy, then my eye area started getting a little weird so i stopped, then i realize that you shouldn't use the new dimension serukm in the eye area, so i continue using my regular night serum and eye cream in the night and only the new dimension and eye cream during the day, my face started changing, and not looking as great as bfore, it was not only the texture of the sking, it was everything overall, i keep wondering what it was, the hollows under my eyes came back, the dark circles, the smile lines, i started thinking if maybe i loose weight and that was the reason, all the baby fat that keep the face full and plump maybe was gone because of that? but no, my diet, weight, exercise, and lifestyle remain the same... So after thinking what was different, i realzed that my face was looking exactly like before PERFECTIONIST (i didn't even remember this serum since i never thought gave it the credit for my amazing looks) i even started thinking i need it fillers to look as healthy and plumped as i looked during the perfectionist era so i research the ingredients on this serum and it have cholesterol, linoleic acid among others, super simple yet effective ingredients that ACT LIKE FILLERS when they are applied topically.. so i started using the rest of my new dimension serum in hands and neck and i bought again PERFECTIONIST, i've been using it since May and OMG, guys seriously no joking, now i can totally give it credit for my skin, i can already see my eye area more plumped, the skin lifted and clear, the remain serum that i have on my fingers i use it on my lips ans even them look fuller...  PLEASE EsteeLauder, never discontinue this product, and if your skin is dry use a good moisturizer after this serum and give it a good try every day for more than 2 or 3 months, its amazing have it builds the skin, is like a liquid filler OVER TIME, not instantly, hope this helps and again sorry for my english oops"

The formula itself feels dry. I always apply moisturizer after serum, but I still want a serum to spread easily and evenly, even if it is not particularly moisturizing. I make sure my face is soaked with toner before I apply, otherwise I find I need to use way more product than recommended.   My skin felt and appeared smoother immediately, but it was more of primer mask than it was my actual skin. There is just no way it happens that fast.  Regardless of its claims, the way this product feels is the reason I don't think it offers nourishment or protection to the structure of the skin.   That said, this is a nice sort of makeup primer or blurring product."

My Grandmother, who is 76 and looks about 60, swears by Estée Lauder so the first time I ever thought about anti-aging products, which was about 6 years ago when I turned 27, I thought about Estée Lauder. The ANR serum was the first I ever tried and it really helped to even out my skin tone and it was a great preventative measure. Now that I'm 34, I felt the need to try something geared more toward repairing and this is truly amazing. I have a lot of marks from past breakouts, large pores, and some fine lines mostly in the places where I used to get bad breakouts and this has helped with all of those issues. It's helped over time and better yet, it helps improve the look of my skin instantly. The texture is silky and the silicones in it help to minimize pores, lines, acne scars, and it works so well under makeup. It didn't dry my skin out as others have stated but then again, I still have a very oily t-zone. Oh and the silicone in it isn't overbearing. It's just the right balance - my skin can still breath yet it helps to make my face much smoother. This is one of the few serums on the market I can honestly say is worth the money."

			"review_text": "I got a sample size of this face serum and had it sitting around for some time, and then I decided to try it. I used it only a couple of times and was completely blown away. First of all it goes on like silk, leaving my skin with a velvety finish almost immediately. only a few small dabs cover my whole face well. I always mist my face with a toner to allow me to use less of my costly skin products. I noticed right away that my skin felt buttery soft and smooth after applying this serum. I also noticed that my fine lines were less noticeable and I was looking really closely LOL!!! I am definitely going to buy the full size of this product. I have never been a great lover of Estee Lauder products. I kind of associated EL as an older woman's make up line, but I guess I am an older woman now so here I am. Just kidding I was really wowed by this serum and it does what it says it does. well worth the money, just apply sparingly and the full size bottle should last quite a long while. I am actually not finished with my tiny tester sized bottle yet. LOL"
