I even developed an abscess in my upper chest and neck.Never again.   Ingrown Hair Pads with BHA & AHA  This product is useless. It gave me an allergic reaction & it actually burned my skin. PASS  KP Smoothing Body Lotion with 10% AHA To be honest I haven't tried the lotion yet. Based on the reviews its a hit or miss."
