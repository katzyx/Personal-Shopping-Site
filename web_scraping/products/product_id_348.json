			"review_text": "I recently tested Ded cool Fragrance 01 Taunt for 5 days, hoping to find a fresh everyday summer scent. The first thing I noticed was the packaging. The box has a nice, smooth texture that feels luxurious. The bottle itself is pretty standard, but it serves its purpose. The scent was everything I was looking for. It’s incredibly refreshing and adapts well to different body chemistries. When I applied it, the fragrance leaned towards a floral note, while on my boyfriend, it had a sweeter essence. It’s truly genderless. The scent is clean and refreshing, making it great for an everyday fragrance. It has a subtle vanilla note to it, which kinda acts like an afterthought. This gives a light sweetness without being overpowering, making it perfect for me. I typically gravitate towards vanilla scents in winter but prefer something less sweet and warm during the summer. However, it didn’t last. Both my boyfriend and I did a 24-hour wear test, and we found that the scent didn’t last beyond six hours. Given this, I wouldn’t rely on this perfume to keep you smelling fresh throughout an entire day. Instead, it’s better for a short outing or as a scent before bed. Overall, the Ded cool Fragrance 01 Taunt has a delightful and adaptable fragrance. It can be great for layering scents, or as an everyday scent for lounging at home or for short periods."

			"review_text": "There are not many things I can say that I do everyday systematically, but one of the things I do religiously everyday is put on perfume. I have been using perfume since I was little, my mom always told me to smell good and never be known as the stinky one. I have a large perfume collection. For me it’s a big pick me up and really sets my mood. I love that there are so many choices available for everyone. I have to say that Dedcool is a newer brand that really has stepped out of the box with wonderful scents that are genderless. But most importantly Dedcoom makes nontoxic products. It used organic and certified vegan ingredients in their genderless fragrances. The fragrance 01 “Taunt” is one of my all time fragrances I own and use. The fragrance has some beautiful top notes like bergamot and fresh dew, middle notes of floral and cassis and the bottom notes are vanilla and amber, even if you are not an notes expert all you need to know is that this fragrance is amazing. The fragrance has a medium strength so it does not give off a super stinky scent. This fragrance makes me feel sexy and empowered thanks to the amber note."

			"review_text": "I'm new to fragrances and was excited to try out Taunt because the combination of sparkling citrus and vanilla sounded intriguing to me.  I'm not a fan of artificial vanilla scents, like Warm Vanilla Sugar makes me nauseous, and thankfully this was not artificial.  However, it's definitely vanilla heavy.  I wanted to smell more of the citrus, but unfortunately it gets lost in all the vanilla; I smelled it once when I first sprayed it, then the vanilla takes over.  The brand described it as an ice cream date and that's pretty much what it smells like: melted vanilla ice cream.  Because it's so vanilla heavy I wouldn't really call it a genderless fragrance, since vanilla is much more associated as a feminine scent.  I think if it were more balanced with the citrus it could give more genderless.  The strength is definitely medium.  My sister has a sensitive nose and didn't comment on it, actually no one really commented on it.  It also didn't last all day, but definitely long enough.  I haven't tried layering it, so I'd like to try doing that with a citrus scent and seeing how that goes.  Also a word of caution: the website says to spray on skin and clothes, the packaging says to spray on skin; I say to spray on skin since it definitely has oil in it and you don't want to mess up certain fabrics."

			"review_text": "Taunt by DedCool is a truly genderless scent composition coupling delicious and warm vanilla with the woodsy musk of amber. The blend is further balanced by the light citrus and spicy profile of bergamot. I really love the universality of this fragrance and find it has a very comforting, lived in feel when I wear it and immediately syncs with skin’s chemistry. Spray a slip of paper with Taunt after applying to your skin and a few minutes later, note how different the two scent surfaces are. There is a fast fade on this parfum, and if you appreciate a more subtle wear in fragrance this may be perfect. If you prefer a stronger sillage or more permanent wear you may need a layered application to help it last or a refresh spray at some point in the day. Overall Taunt is truly a universal and naturally captivating scent that would work well on anyone."

			"review_text": "I love DedCool as a brand, and Taunt is my new favorite vanilla fragrance. This genderless perfume is nothing short of yummy- the interplay between its vanilla, amber, and bergamot notes creates a warm and inviting aroma. The vanilla provides a sweet, creamy base that is deliciously balanced by the amber and bergamot, keeping it from becoming overly saccharine or feminine. The vanilla comes through as an inherently rich and comforting scent, softened and enhanced by the bergamot and amber.  The amber adds a layer of warmth and depth, creating a lingering sense of peace and calm, while the bergamot brings a citrusy freshness that complements the richness of the amber and the sweetness of the vanilla. Together, the blend creates a harmony that is both luxurious and serene.  One of my favorite aspects of Taunt is its versatility. It's perfect for any time of the day, even during intense workouts. In fact, it creates an even more delightful scent when it mingles with your sweat. I love spritzing myself with it before my daily run… I smell good even when I'm sweating like crazy. There's something about the way the fragrance evolves with my body heat that I love. And after a long and luxurious shower, I love layering it with other fragrances depending on my mood… it’s an act of self-care that I look forward to. I even find myself taking whiffs of my wrists when I’m stressed out because the scent calms me and makes me feel content.  The boyfriend also can't get enough of it. He loves snuggling up to me and inhaling the scent from my neck when we’re Netflix and chilling. It smells amazing but slightly different on him- unfortunately for him, I warned him to keep his hands off… it’s all mine.   The cool, young, and hip design of the bottle, with its signature bar code, makes it stand out from my other fragrances. It reminds me that fragrance is meant to be playful and fun.   I recommend this to anyone looking for a scent that is both versatile and fun. Its genderless appeal"

This dreamy scent is the absolute warmest embrace on a cool Autumn day. I pick up heavily on the amber and vanilla notes of this EDP and can feel them encapsulate me as I spritz them on. This is my first experience with the brand Dedcool and I am a huge fan. Their minimalistic packaging really leaves you to appreciate the beauty of the fragrance itself. I love the sleek, clear glass bottle with its fine black text and unique barcode. Their atomizer on the bottle provides a burst of this perfect, even mist. I love that this fragrance it's genderless and vegan. Both my husband and I really appreciated the scent and we're able to uniquely adorn it."

			"review_text": "I've been a beauty enthusiast for five years and have been blessed with the opportunity of testing and reviewing a variety of products, but this was my first time trying a product from dedcool and let me tell you it did not disappoint. I will say I usually lean more towards citrus and musk types of scents, but I do have a love in my heart for a warm vanilla and floral scent like this one every now and then. The packaging is very simple and minimalistic as it comes in a glass bottle with a metal nozzle and elegant bar code design that features the name of the perfume underneath that which I absolutely love. When I first apply it to my skin, the vanilla takes center stage, filling my senses full of richy sweet scent notes that I find to be super peaceful and calming, but over time, this fragrance transforms and settles into a floraly bergamot scent with slight hints of warm and powdery amber that I find to be soothing, stress reducing and very cosy like wrapping myself in a cashmere sweater. I think the scent notes in this fragrance work so perfectly together, but I can't lie, I was expecting it to be a little citrusy due to the bergamot, but I was so wrong. I also don't find it to have much longevity as I can't tell I applied it within about four hours and I also don't think it's a genderless fragrance as it's just to sweet and floraly. Overall, I really like this scent and how it works with my body chemistry and will definitely purchase it again even though it doesn't last that long!"

The top notes of bergamot and fresh dew give a fresh burst during the beginning of the fragrance. I find the combination of citrus and floral notes give off a clean, crisp aroma. The middle notes of floral and cassis give off a floral yet fruity aroma that brings the perfect amount of sweetness to the perfume. The base notes of vanilla and amber are what really made me fall in love with Taunt. The combination of these two truly give a warm and cozy finish to this incredible perfume. Dedcool has created a scent that seems so familiar to my senses, every time I smell it I get a sensation of feeling at home. This perfume is perfect for any occasion, it’s not overwhelming by any means which can make it a perfect scent for a work environment. It has the perfect staying-power for me as well. I have worn this for 8+ hours and could still smell it on my skin when I came home. I can confidently say that I will be wearing this quite often!"

This perfume is for me because I love vanilla smells and perfume has vanilla in it, which I just love. That’s why when I first smelt it I knew I was gonna love it right off the bat and use it every other day. However, it’s not an every day smell because it is very strong. I do believe it’s gender neutral since it doesn’t smell like it’s for a boy or a girl However, this perfume is just it and is going into my collection!"

The vanilla notes are also crisp, more like grains of sugar between my teeth than the waft of warm baked goods. It’s interestingly not so much a gourmand scent despite the vanilla notes, as it’s balanced with florals and resolves to a delicate powderiness.   Though it’s advertised as genderless, and I believe that most things are (anyone can wear a dress; clothes don’t have a gender), this fragrance is more on the feminine side with its sweetness and floral bouquet. I don’t find it particularly long-lasting, and it doesn’t seem to grab onto my clothes, which is a shame."

I liked how the sweetness isn't too feminine or overpowering. If you enjoy white florals and a clean musk scent, this is the fragrance for you! I liked how this clean and vegan scent didn't irritate my skin either. I have sensitive skin and sometimes get rashes from certain fragrances! The scent lasts a long time on me too so I think this bottle will last me a while. I'd reccomend this fragrance if you're looking for a simple and affordable product. This scent is simple enough that it can layer well with other fragrances! I really enjoyed layering this product with some floral perfumes that I own."

The DedCool 01 Taunt fragrance at first spray reminded me of high school summer days. The first note that I smell is fresh dew, leading into a light hint of floral, then it quickly softens to a spicy vanilla.  Most vanilla scented fragrances are too sweet for me and often gives me headaches. The vanilla in the 01 Taunt melts into my skin and leaves a subtle tinge of sweetness.  This fragrance doesn't wear very long on my skin so I like to wear it to bed with a body butter that enchanted the scent.  Anytime I leave my home, I like to spray on a fragrance and because this scent is so light, I can spray this on before running errands."

			"review_text": "This review was collected as part of a promotion.  As a hairstylist, makeup artist and content creator, I like things that look and smell good, so I was so excited to be introduced to this brand. I absolutely *love* the concept of a genderless fragrance. Why? Because I'm the one who walks up to fragrance counters and douses myself with men's cologne. I don't want to stay in my lane when it comes to perfume - I'm all about the unisex fragrance. Remember Ck One by Calvin Klein? That's not what this scent reminds me of, but that's what Dedcool's concept reminds me of. Dead cool, right?   I'll be honest, the scent Taunt didn't do it for me. I'm more of a citrus or musk fan, and I'm not sure if it was the vanilla or amber that felt a little sweet for my palette (but I love bergamot, which is in here); but I'm giving it 4 stars because I feel like just because this particular blend didn't mesh with me, I know they have something else I'd like. And I think their idea for genderless fragrance is brilliant. This means you can buy this for someone as a cool gift and do it based off notes, not whether it's a cologne or perfume. Also, all was not lost because I ended up layering this with my other perfume I normally wear, and it paired really well. I think that's what's neat about this brand - you can layer it. You don't have to alternate it with your regular, tried-and-true perfume or cologne. Just layer.   Great brand, great quality, and I will definitely be on the lookout for their more lemony or musk-based scents. Glad they're on my radar now."

So if you tend to go for warm, sensual vanilla-based perfumes, this might be for you. It features notes of vanilla, amber, and bergamot. It’s a bit of a medium scent - not too heavy at all, but you can definitely tell you’re wearing something, though I do find it fades if trying to wear it all day. Something that is cool with DedCool perfumes is that they are designed with the potential to be layered with other scents. I love wearing Taunt on its own, but I have also tried it layered with DedCool’s layering scents Milk and Xtra Milk. It smells a little different with each but still great, giving you three unique smells and ways to wear it. DedCool also prides itself on most of their scents being genderless. I think that is largely true; however, I would say that Taunt leans more feminine-smelling to me."

			"review_text": "I fell in love with Taunt at first whiff, it carries some of the same notes as their XtraMilk but that Vanilla packs a punch, I smell downright edible. It smells like a warm summer morning: light citrus sweetness with a heavy powdery feel. That Bergamot invigorates the senses but it's almost as if you were lured awake. I wished that note could have bloomed a little more though. It's a nice level beyond a skin scent, making it easy to layer, but remains light and natural. I layered this scent with Maison Louise Marie No.14 which just added the perfect touch of sexy dark floral. I still prefer to wear it alone especially in the mornings as it doesn't trigger any headaches for me. It remains niche and unique enough that it leaves an impression. The Vanilla Amber notes reminds me of Maison Margiela's By the Fireplace. When I first smelled this scent, it reminded me of clouds because you feel warm and soft. I could see this scent pairing really well with oud or woody scents making it a year-round staple!"

When I first tried their discovery set I instantly fell in love with Taunt and I mean INSTANTLY!! This scent reminds being at the beach at night with a bonfire because it’s a clean, warm scent to me and I just can’t think of a better way to describe how it makes me feel.  The key notes of Bergamot, Vanilla, Amber and honestly notes that always attract me so it is no surprise that I love this. While I love wearing this alone, it lasts far better layered and the best pairing I have found would be to start with Xtra Milk and then top it with Taunt and that is just the crème de la crème.  Seriously, if this has been on your list, I highly think it is worth checking out"

This is my second time trying a ded cool fragrance and once again I just have to say it did not disappoint. While the scent was refreshing and unique my favorite feature is the fact that it can be buildable and layered with other fragrance notes very nicely. I focus when applying fragrance behind my ears and on my wrists . And this scent has a long lasting fragrance compared to other scents with the same notes. I love that this scent also pairs fresh with bakery in a sense. The bottle is sleek classy and simple which is exactly what ded cool brings to mind whenever I think about it. I would recommend this scent for anyone who needs something daily or even for a night out."

This perfume is comprised of two of my favorite scents, amber and vanilla, both of which come through just beautifully in the fragrance giving it a scent that is both warm and just a little something spicy while the notes of bergamot gives it a lovely fresh addition, making for a scent that is both unique and fun. I also love that this perfume can be layered to make it into something unique only unto myself, I just wish it lasted a little longer. One of the best thing about this brand and this perfume is that the formula is entirely vegan and also certified organic and to top it off, it's made in the USA.  Another thing to mention, this comes in a lovely glass bottle that just looks classy on my dressing table. The scent of this perfume just makes me feel good about myself and I'd recommend it to anyone looking for a scent to be their new signature.   This review was collected as part of a promotion."

Now I can’t wait to try other fragrances and products from them. The sweetness of the vanilla blended with the fresh bergamot and sensual amber created such a lovely scent to the nose. Whether I used this fragrance alone, or layered it with another— I would get whiffs of it throughout the day. Longevity is also something I hope for when trying a new fragrance, so to me this one was a win! And even if I became nose blind to it, I still would receive compliments on it!

Minimalist chic with a touch of edginess that screams I’m not your average scent.   Now, let’s get to the good stuff - the smell! Imagine a creamy swirl of vanilla clouds floating through a citrus sky. It’s like daydreaming about your first crush or that perfect summer day that you never wanted to end. Every spritz is a burst of bergamot freshness followed by a warm embrace of amber that just makes me feel… alive. It’s light, it’s playful, and yet there’s a depth to it that’s utterly captivating. Spritzing this on is like flipping your hair in slow motion while the world watches in awe. It’s the vanilla citrus love child that summer flings wish they could be.  Wearing this fragrance is like slipping into a persona that’s confident, a bit mysterious, and totally irresistible. Every time I wear it, I feel like I’m strutting down an invisible runway, leaving a trail of who’s that? in the air. It’s the kind of smell that makes you want to ask me out for coffee just to stay in my scented orbit a little longer.   And because Dedcool is all about that clean, green, vegan scene, I can spritz with abandon, knowing my fabulousness isn’t costing the earth. So here’s to smelling like a dream and living the ecoconscious queen lifestyle."

It lasts a good 6 hours or more. I've paired it with just body spray and other perfumes. It gives a great base to other scents, but it stands up well all on It's own, too. I noticed that as I wear it, if I get warm, the scent gets warmer. If I'm inside in the cool air, the lighter notes sing.

I also feel like the scent story seem to evolve on a light powdery scent. I did not particularly notice the citrus notes which i usually gravitates toward to as well. This is a warm scent that is perfect for everyday wear either by men or women. Dedcool scents are also layerable so I will definitely try layering it next time.

The parfum has a perfect blend of soft and sweet notes that create a warm, inviting aura. With the first spritz, I could sense a light sweetness that is not overpowering; after the initial spritz, the scent transitions to a blend of creamy vanilla and amber. My friends said it has a sexy vanilla scent. After the spritz dries down, Taunt leaves a skin-like musk that lingers for several hours throughout the day. The longevity is okay as it lasts several hours without reapplication, but it definitely does not last the whole day (reason why I took off one star).

It is also a  beautiful vanilla perfume with hints of Bergamote and  Amber which I smell very clearly. I’m in love with the brand logo as well very unique. As soon as I got this perfume I wore it out and I had gotten in the elevator with a stranger and they said “somebody smells good” and as the days past I got the same compliment because this perfume really is THE BOMB. It’s not too soft nor strong and the scent lasts a long time. It states that this perfume is genderless but it falls more into the female side for me.

Taunt opens with the sweet note of vanilla but the addition of bergamot and amber really warms up the overall scent profile and adds a touch of subtle sexiness. It smells like one of those expensive “it girl” niche perfumes but at a surprisingly affordable price point.  The projection and lasting power of Taunt is above average, I can still smell it on myself 4+ hours later. I also love that this is a very layerable scent and I can mix and match it with so many other scents in my collection. I feel like this scent would work for any season which makes this perfume so dynamic and versatile.  I highly recommend adding this to your collection if you want something that is warm, sweet, sexy and sophisticated and can be worn for any occasion."

That being said Taunt blew me out of the water! It's honestly the first fragrance I loved as soon as it spritzed out and hit my nose. The pleasant scent remained as is lasted through the day and I didn't notice a shift in scent besides being a little weaker than when first applied but that's to be expected. I can sometimes be nose blind with amber so I wasn't sure I'd be able to sniff that aspect but I can tell it (along with the bergamot) aid in making the vanilla more warm and sensual. It's not a sickeningly sweet vanilla, more warm and inviting, think house that just baked cookies versus inhaling frosting. If you are on the fence definitely try Dedcool's trial size to see for yourself. Honestly though you'll probably love it!!! This review was collected as part of a promotion."

What I chose to layer it with was a more tropical/summer-forward fragrance; it layered very nicely. The bergamont note is very nice, and it really shines in this fragrance, so if bergamont is something you really enjoy, this would be great for you. Since it is warm and has fresh dew and floral notes, I think you could wear this in any season and on any occasion. Something else to note about 01 Taunt is that it is long-lasting but not overpowering, so you can choose to layer it if you would like to. I also love the spray on it, and the packaging is really unique and beautiful. It is definitely a fragrance that I want to display."

The aftersmell is peachy with some vanilla. It’s faint so it won’t give you a headache, but I like that it lasts. I like that it’s small enough to be fit in a purse, but big enough to last u months.

From the moment I first experienced it, I was captivated by its complexity and allure. This exquisite blend of notes creates a fragrance that is both sophisticated and alluring, making it the perfect choice for any occasion.  The top notes of bergamot and fresh dew immediately draw you in with their bright and refreshing aroma. The citrusy and green notes are invigorating and uplifting, creating a sense of freshness that is both energizing and invigorating. These initial scents set the stage for what is to come, creating a captivating and memorable first impression.  As the fragrance begins to settle, the middle notes of floral and cassis emerge, adding a touch of sweetness and femininity to the mix. The floral notes are delicate and romantic, while the cassis adds a juicy and fruity element that adds depth and complexity to the scent. This combination of notes creates a beautiful and harmonious blend that is both captivating and enchanting.  The base notes of vanilla and amber provide a warm and sensual foundation that lingers on the skin long after the initial application. The sweet and creamy vanilla is comforting and inviting, while the amber adds a rich and exotic touch that adds a sense of mystery and intrigue.  One of the things I love most about Fragrance 01 Taunt is its versatility. This fragrance is perfect for both day and evening wear, making it a great choice for any occasion. Whether you're heading to the office or out for a night on the town, this fragrance will leave you feeling confident, elegant, and sophisticated.  The longevity and sillage of Fragrance 01 Taunt are also worth noting. This fragrance has great staying power, lasting for hours on the skin without needing to be reapplied.  Overall, Fragrance 01 Taunt is a masterpiece of a scent that I would highly recommend to anyone looking for a unique and captivating fragrance."

I have gotten many compliments whenever I wear it my friend really seems to love it. I wish it had more longevity, after a couple of hours, the scent fades completely. Not only that, but I always reapply it throughout the day, but something to consider because it gives mist feeling more than perfume in terms of longevity. If you are looking for a fragrance that lasts all day long, this might not be your perfect match. Despite the reapplication factor, I absolutely love this one, and it works beautifully on my skin.

The fragrance is long-lasting, which is a plus, but its intensity could be toned down a notch for those who prefer a subtler scent.  The overall composition is sophisticated, with a blend of undertones that slowly emerge, adding depth and complexity to the initial vanilla burst. It’s a fragrance that demands attention and leaves a lasting impression. Though not my go-to due to its potency, I appreciate its high quality and unique character. For those who adore a dominant vanilla aroma, DedCool 01 Taunt will undoubtedly become a staple in their collection.  While it’s a bit too strong for my everyday wear, I can see it being a perfect fit for evening outings or special occasions where you want your fragrance to make a statement."

Taunt is a perfume for any age—it reminds me of when I was a teenager but is elegant enough to wear as an adult. It is not too overpowering, even if you put a lot on. The scent lasts pretty well throughout the day, but I spray more later as it fades. I get whiffs of it here and there. I usually don't go for vanilla scents as I age, but I am digging this perfume! I love that Deadcool is genderless and vegan. One pump gives off a good amount of perfume in a fine mist. Can't wait to layer it with other dedcool scents and see what it smells like!  I will get this for my friend's daughter, who loves vanilla scents! Great fragrance for a teenager!"

Upon the initial spray I get that bergamot not with a hint of dew, the hint of few reminds me of bright spring mornings as a kid. It then transforms and I get this warm berry note, I’m guessing from the cassis, It kind of reminds me of a warm fruity pie as the base notes start to present. At the dry down stage the vanilla and amber take center stage but I still also get a hint of berries in the background which I love as berry notes are one of my favorites. The vanilla really warms up on my skin during the dry down and I’ve had a chance to layer it with some other fragrances I own and it’s such a great scent for layering! I can smell this for about 2-3 hours before it becomes more of a skin scent but I think it’s perfect for settings where you don’t want a overwhelming fragrance because I don’t think many people would find this scent offensive, it’s very pleasant!"

I personally really loved taunt over Dedcools other fragrance “Xtra Milk.” I love the confidence boost this fragrance gives me.

A light spray on your neck or wrist is all that is needed for a tantalizing scent that lasts the whole day through."

Also, DedCool fragrance are perfect for layering. For Taunt, I highly recommend you try it layered over their Xtra Milk fragrance, sometimes.  Taunt gives me Creamsicle Dreams vibes. On me, it smells like orange/citrus and vanilla, which is a combination that I absolutely adore. And, it lasts for a decent amount of time as well.  Lastly, let's discuss the packaging. Just as DedCool's fragrances as Unisex, so are the boxes and bottles. I love how simplistic their packaging is. There's no big butterflies or flowers or loud, gaudy neon letters here. Just simplistic, easy to read packaging.  I would highly recommend this fragrance to everyone."

If you’re looking for a clean perfume that isn’t too strong, I highly suggest one from this brand. the bottle is a glass bottle and it’s made really well. It also comes with a good amount of product. The only thing I didn’t like is that you do have a spray so often because it does wear off or maybe my nose is just used to the scent but that’s not a big deal.

			"review_text": "As a self-proclaimed vanilla lover, I was drawn to DedCool 01 Taunt Eau de Parfum. The description boasting vanilla notes promised a delightful scent experience, and I couldn't wait to try it!  Initially, DedCool 01 Taunt did not disappoint. The scent on my skin leaned more vanilla-forward, fulfilling my vanilla obsession—exactly what I craved! However, the fragrance offered an interesting twist.  Over time, the fragrance developed a strong floral note. While this wasn't unpleasant, it did overpower the vanilla scent I was enjoying. It seems my body chemistry amplifies the floral middle notes in the perfume. This is important to consider, especially for a fragrance marketed as unisex.  Here's a breakdown of what I found:  Vanilla: There's definitely vanilla, and it provides a beautiful initial impression, but it's not the star of the show throughout.  Floral (Middle Notes): The fragrance has strong floral middle notes that emerge over time.  Overall:  If you're looking for a long-lasting, purely vanilla perfume, DedCool 01 Taunt might not be the best choice. The fragrance transforms over time, with the vanilla fading and the floral middle notes taking center stage. This could be interesting for some, but for vanilla lovers like myself, it might be a bit disappointing. Additionally, the strong floral presence might be confusing for those seeking a truly unisex fragrance. (This review was collected as part of a promotion)"

It's balanced somewhere in between where you can smell citrus but complimented by vanilla.  The fragrance starts off with a lovely citrusy bergamot and a creamy vanilla. And then comes the rich amber in the back. The fragrance develops really nicely over time. It is a really lovely fragrance I can see layered with other Dedcool products or another citrus or vanilla fragrance. However, I don't think this is one that works well on my skin. I greatly prefer smelling this on a smelling blotter or in a room as opposed to it on my arm. That being said, I still think its smell great and would recommend this for those you like vanilla but don't want something super sweet."

It is more of a personal scent and has good performance.  I like the fragrance notes, I can smell the vanilla, bergamot and amber most noticeably. I like that it has clean ingredients as well.  This scent is really pleasant without being overpowering. I like that it’s a great day time perfume.  I think this is a good perfume for unisex and it leans feminine. I will wear this often, and I think it goes well with either winter or summer seasons.  I think this perfume goes well on its own and can be layered as well with other scents as well. I would definitely recommend checking it out!   **This review was collected as part of a promotion."

And this hits just right on spot I love the fact that this fragrance is easily available and doesn’t break my bank. Also the notes of this fragrance doesn’t makes it only to use in a specific season I think the notes of this fragrance makes it more versatile I see myself wearing this fragrance not only everyday but every season it’s that unique. It’s going to be staple in my collection."

This scent is both creamy and alluring.What I love most about Taunt is its softness; it's a scent that is memorable without being overpowering. It's perfect for those moments when you want to leave a lasting impression without overwhelming the senses of those around you. I first used Taunt after a swim at the pool. I appreciate having a fragrance that is subtle enough for the gym or pool, where strong perfumes might bother those who are sensitive to scents.The scent immediately won me over as soon as I smelled it, and I can confidently say it's a fragrance I would love to have as my signature base scent. Additionally, the atomizer is fantastic—one powerful mist with a single pump ensures even distribution without waste. Overall, Fragrance 01 Taunt by Dedcool is a delightful addition to any fragrance collection and one I highly recommend."

It’s a great scent to wear year round because of the notes like Bergamot and Amber mixed in with the Vanilla. These notes  combined make for an amazing unisex fragrance.  It has a perfect balance between a cozy, warm vanilla scent while also smelling clean like your skin but better. It is a subtle gourmand scent and I mostly pick up on the vanilla. I love vanilla fragrances and this one is  becoming my favorite. It is not too sweet or overwhelming. It is creamy and yummy. I can’t get enough of it, it will make you smell delectable! It lasts a pretty long time on me and I can’t stop smelling myself! Would highly recommend especially if your a vanilla lover like I am!"

So this time i got hands on DEDCOOL  fragrance number 01 and oh my goodness, this is hands down the best perfume i ever used. The best part is its genderless which you rarely see in many brands. This dedcool Taunt has vanilla amber and bergamot. The smell is so sub settle no matter how much you spray. I can still smells this while writing this and cann’t get over this smell. It doesn’t smells like sweet vanilla you can layer it with other perfumes easily but i love it alone. The smell was long lasting on me which i experienced.The packaging is quite decent looking. Simple yet gives an expensive feel! This smell can be for all seasons so if you are looking for one perfume thats perfect for each season you must try this scent."

Taunt is described as using bergamot, vanilla and amber notes. This scent isn’t overpowering at all no matter how many times you spray it. It has this subtle yet beautiful dry down where you really can smell the vanilla. I love that is isn’t an overly sweet vanilla, so you can layer it with other scents perfectly. I can’t stop smelling myself as I am writing this, this is definitely one of my new favorite scents. A lot of my fragrances I like to coordinate seasonally with the weather but this one can be worn at anytime in my opinion, it really is a universal, genderless and amazing fragrance that I could not be happier with !"

			"review_text": "Fragrance plays an integral role in my life, especially as a professional writer. Nothing sparks my creativity like a juicy waft of citrus or a warm hint of vanilla. Even though I wear a variety of fragrances, gourmand scents predominate my collection. Dedcool’s “Taunt” is an easy choice for me on warm days because the vanilla doesn’t skew toward the candied spectrum. The floral notes ground this scent, so you won’t smell like pastry or crave sweets.   I would characterize Taunt as a light-to-medium scent with minimal staying power. This is something you’ll need to refresh after a few hours, or, if you like layering your scents, this also plays nicely with more floral-dominant fragrances. For my needs, I apply an unscented body oil after my shower and then spritz Taunt on my neck and wrists. This helps the longevity without disturbing the scent.   Closing Thought: If you haven’t found your perfect vanilla, give Taunt a try. It’s easy to wear no matter what your age and has a sophisticated amber base note that adds to the creamy scent."

I am instantly sent beyond the clouds into raindrops of golden sweet vanilla, atop a delicate and long lasting crystal kingdom of light and sparkling gold. A bit of the dramatic to describe how I feel once this domed, plain, glass bottle atomizes its beauty into my skin, and heart. This fragrance is anything but overwhelming, yet it lasts for more than a sunrise. I often pair it with XtraMilk or wear it on its own.. but it can be paired beautifully with several other types of fragrances. I recommend this as a human who loves fragrances from all spectrums, and I say yes, yes, yes, a million times yes that you should absolutely smell this or try it on yourself!"

It is what makes me happy . It’s my passion .  I have tried out all of the main dedcool scents , I didn’t get to try out any of the limited edition collections  or discontinued scents but all the currents .  Taunt is by far my most favorite from the brand . I think of pheromone scents and this comes to mind . For me , I can’t exactly pick up the vanilla or amber notes but it smells amazing. This is - your skin but better Mixed with a clean white t shirt - type of scent . I believe it would be perfect for both males and females . It can be layered nicely with a wide range of other scents . It lasts almost all day on me  as well .  I’ve seen some commenters mention the oiliness , and yes it’s fairly oily but that’s just because the concentration is higher than your average perfume, much closer to a perfume oil . You can easily fix it by just dabbing it into your skin to prevent build up or it staining your clothes . If I was to compare it to another scent , I think lake and sky 11 11 is probably the closest . Or bath and body works ivory cashmere  spray ."

I have only used it twice but I noticed it has a good lasting time. I sprayed around 7pm and woke up the next morning still being able to smell it on myself. It is soft and not overbearing, does not give me a headache or make me nauseous like a lot of perfumes do. This scent is addictive and I definitely recommend giving it a try.

			"review_text": "I am basing the review off of a sample I received around the holidays. I received this one and the fragrance milk. This one is called “Taunt” but the vial says Fragrance No 1. Fragrance is subjective and different on everyone. To me, this smells strongly of a stale cigarette tray, like the tin ones that used to sit out at McDonalds back when you could smoke in restaurants. I get none of the notes mentioned on the scent profile at all. It’s maybe sort of Off bug spray and Pledge. Worse, it’s like “tastable”. Did you ever have a fragrance that you can actually “taste”, but not in a good cherry cheesecake kind of way, but in a bad, irritating the back of your throat kind of way. I’m not a social media follower, but I understand based on other comments this must be getting a lot of advertising by different “influencers”. Remember that these people are paid by companies and sent free stuff to talk up their products so take everything you hear and see online with a grain of salt. Don’t get me wrong because I’ve discovered a lot of genuinely great things from ads, but this shouldn’t be a blind buy. Try to test in a store or get a sample first. Fortunately, I didn’t have to wash it off because I covered it up with the fragrance milk (it’s a much better scent), BUT both faded super quickly. Within 30 minutes, poof - gone."

First of all, I love the packaging! The scent itself is rejuvenating and fresh. It has notes of Bergamont, Vanilla, and citrus which I liked considering I am not one to jump on vanilla scents very often. I also like that this perfume is genderless, not toxic, and vegan. Whenever I spray this, it instantly reminds me of a warmth, freshness, and a soft gently vibe. This scent is versatile and like I said can layer with another scent. I will definitely try the other scents from this brand. It's a great everyday wear."

When it gets cooler outside, I love to wear cozy, warm fragrances like Taunt 01.  Taunt 01 is such an unusual scent; it transitions from a juicy, fresh bergamot and dewdrop to a warm and sensual combination of vanilla and amber. I don't even have enough words to describe it, but I can describe the feeling.  It's like getting cozy under a cool blanket and slowly warming up, like a big hug on a rainy day. That's how the air smells after a light rain, when it's still warm outside.  *Gifted by Sephora*"

It’s warm but there’s a coolness to it, I looked at the ingredients on the back of my box and it says there’s also cucumber, tea, and marshmallow notes in here. I don’t know why they wouldn’t list that bc it makes it seem much more interesting in my opinion. It’s a gourmand but not too sweet, definitely unisex. Very addictive, I’m on my second bottle of this. I have the lotion but it’s not that strong either. Gotta be playing it cool when you wear this bc no matter how much you spray it’ll only last a couple hours.

I may get a full size to wear it to bed because it’s so cozy. It’s not super sweet and sugary. It’s almost slightly masculine and I love that. It doesn’t project but I don’t think it’s intended to. I’d call this a masculine vanilla. That sounds weird but coming from someone who leans towards gourmands, fruity florals, and anything with vanilla, I loved this so much."

This is sweet without being annoying, has a hint of freshness, and overall just smells cozy. Like you smell good, but not like perfume. It reminds me a little bit of the hot topic perfumes from the 2000s (specifically the nightmare before christmas Sally perfume) in the best way. I'm so happy this scent exists."

Taunt also layers well with Madonna Lilly if you’re into laying perfumes, but performs so well on its own.
