			"review_text": "I'm honestly floored by how well this worked for me. First, I was shocked this shade worked so well for me: I have pretty fair skin with cool undertones and was fairly certain I'd just look like a pumpkin, but I'm really glad I tried it on in the store. I don't use much product, and when I blend it out, it's still orange, but close enough of a neighbor to coral in a really beautiful way that it's not overwhelming or clownish (no shade to the clowns out there, it's just not my journey). Definitely unique to my collection. It looks intimidating, but don't be scared! I encourage you to at least try it on if your local store has a tester (don't forget to use the alcohol provided to sanitize) because you might be surprised! Also, because it looks so intense, it's more likely to be in stock. At my local store, some shades were sold out or down to the last one or two, but there was a stack of these guys.  I use this product sparingly, applying two little dots to bare skin on each cheek (barely a tap, each), and use my fingers to blend/tap them to disperse. From there, it's easy to add a bit to build, if desired, or to add some to even out if you feel like the blend was uneven (for me, this is due to user error, not product quality). So far, I've gone in with the stick directly on the face with my initial two dots (amount will vary, that's just what works for my face size/shape/pigmentation), and use a finger to gather any additional product to add for more control over the amount.   I was also pleasantly surprised by the longevity of this product. I went out with the girls for some very spirited karaoke for my birthday wearing this blush. We were out for hours, it was hot, and I was S W E A T I N G. I'd touched my face and had to blot sweat off on numerous occasions, so I was sure that it must have disappeared, but lo and behold, I looked in the mirror when I got home and it was still on my face, only a little faded."

My first impression was that the tube felt extremely cheap, like a Wet and Wild product. I was expecting glassy and hydrating but it goes on patchy, lifts foundation, it’s not very pigmented, and it doesn’t last. You get such a little amount of product considering how much you have to use."

This is a buttery blush, but not in an easy to blend and creamy way: it looks and feels like I took a big scoop of pink butter and rubbed it all over my cheeks.  They do not read as healthy in person and instead look very greasy and waxy. The stained glass finish looks to hover over skin, not be a glimpse at a glowy skin below.   Points for beautiful shades, though! The Pat McGrath cream blushes are a great option for a balm stick blush that has a healthy finish and will not pick up your base if you're smart about application. The Rhode blush in juice box is a great color swap for Glassy Rosette, though not exact."

When used with any foundation product, I recommend patting it on and lightly blending with a brush or fingers, NOT directly from the stick as it will lift foundation.

The shades are gorgeous and buildable, although I will say that the powder formula is much stronger and provides a much more distinguishable blush. I tried both the pomelo and the pitaya shades, and the pomelo blended a little too much into my natural skin tone. The pitaya stood out a bit more for my fairer skin, but still took a few applications before it was noticeable. Sometimes blush can be really overpowering however so I enjoy the fact that this stick is more sheer. It felt great and blended easily. I think my sponge soaked up a bit of the product however, so I recommend just using your fingers and a gentle ‘tapping’ motion to blend out. As you can tell from my photo, the blush was not super noticeable but provided a nice ‘sun touched’ glow to my skin. This was after two applications and blending. I think for bolder looks I will stick to the powder, but I do enjoy this option for a more natural look & look forward to using it more!"

Not only is it the perfect color match for my lips (and it actually lasts on my dry lips), it is the perfect, buildable color pay off on the cheeks. I have sun spots on both of my cheeks to I have to work hard to cover first with foundation and then concealer. Tricky for me to apply creme blushes without it stripping off my application but this stick blush, first applied to the back of my hand and then dabbed on with a brush applied seamlessly. It is the perfect consistency without being overly glassy. I like a dewey finish but if it gets too glassy on my older skin, it just looks silly.

The fermented arnica helps reduce redness, while the goji berry complex boosts radiance. I love that it's vegan, gluten-free, and cruelty-free. It provides sheer, buildable coverage, feels weightless, and keeps my skin hydrated all day with a healthy glow. Highly recommend!"

The texture on my cheekbones can be very bumpy and rough so I've always been hesitant about what products I apply in that area because I don't want to attract attention to the texture. I feel like the Haus Labs Glass Lip & Cheek Blush Balm Stick blurs the texture on my cheeks so an immediate 10/10 for me! Now I was gifted the Glassy Hibiscus shade which I LOVE mauves. It's very light and I would say depending on how you blend you may need to build it to get to the intensity you want. Which I think is a good think especially in the summer with how hot it gets, your skin can really breath with this formula. I also appreciate how sturdy the case is. The texture of the stick is surprisingly very soft, not squishy but something that I would not want to get loose in my makeup bag while traveling. LUCKILY, the Haus Labs packaging is very sturdy and gives a nice click when you put the cap back on. Traveled with it recently and no accidents in my makeup bag! I was gifted the Glassy Hibiscus shade but I would love to get another shade or two because the formula is so neat and new!"

The other way I applied it was from the brush to my cheek and that was better but I didn't get the color payoff I was hoping for. Maybe the other shades are different but I am returning it, it just wasn't what I thought it would be. Its pretty but not a game changer especially for someone like me who has a large variation of cream blushes in my makeup collection."

The color hibiscus first looks on the purple side, but when applied to the face, I was so glad it looked rosier. This product glides on so smoothly, did not budge all day, and maintained that glassy look at all times. It is also super bendable and very easy to build up in terms of color. I will say, it does not dry fully. It has almost a balm-like consistency when applied to the face, and stays a bit tacky. It wasn't an issue for me, but I'm sure applying setting powder on it would remove that consistency if it's not your preference. That being said, it feels great when applied on the lips! It doesn't dry down patchy when applied to the lips or cheeks. I have a drier skin type and I was glad to see it didn't cling or cause dry patches.  My only con would be the price vs the amount of product we get. It's a great product, but for the amount of product we are getting it is expensive. Overall, I would recommend the product!"

They blend on your skin so smoothly and pair very well with my Haus Labs foundation. It also doubles as a great tinted lip balm!

The color itself is undeniably gorgeous, offering a natural and subtle hue that enhances the complexion effortlessly.

Instead, it can appear slightly dry on the skin, resulting in a less vibrant color payoff than expected. Despite this, I'm willing to give it another try, planning to prep my skin thoroughly beforehand with skincare to achieve a more radiant and dewy finish."

I was gifted this product from Haus Labs and at first I was hesitant as I'm normally not a glossy/dewey kind of guy. I love the Haus Labs powder blush because it is very pigmented, long lasting (without use of cream blushes) and has a blurring effect to them so I was concerned that this would pick up some of my textures, but NO it did not emphasize any texture. I tried them on over a course of few events and different techniques. The picture below is using the stick directly on my skin with foundation on--this I felt was the most pigmented and glassy. I also tried using fingers and was good for a more controlled glow. My favorite technique was using a brush as you can give more dimension and precision as it is very buildable. I also tried this as a highlighter on top of powder blush and yes it gave that glassiness over the blush. I went out to a club and dance all night and did not touch up and it stayed glassy all night.

To my amazement, this shade blended beautifully into a light pink-red blush on my cheeks. The transformation was stunning, and it gave me a flawless, natural-looking flush that complemented my skin tone perfectly. What impressed me even more was the longevity of this blush. I am used to my blush fading by the end of the day, but this product stayed put from morning until evening, still looking as fresh as when I first applied it. The Haus Labs Glassy Blush Balm has definitely earned a spot in my daily makeup routine. Its long-lasting formula and beautiful finish have made it my new go-to blush.

Honestly LOVEEE and I wouldn't usually use an orange color but this one was SOOOO pretty with the hibiscus color!"

Since I model, I come across tons of matte blushes so this dewy and creamy color fuse blush balm was perfect for me because I love that all-day effortless summer glow.I applied the shade glassy tangelo on spf skin, it layered nicely leaving my skin feeling light and airy. It’s also long lasting with out feeling sticky, I put it to the test after 8hrs, my skin still felt hydrated.If you have sensitive skin then the more reason to consider trying it out.The ingredients are certified vegan and there’s no perfume smell.I’m already eyeing my next blush shade!!

It didn't make my face feel sticky and blended beautifully.  I received both the Glassy Pomelo and Glassy Pitaya shades. I really love the Pomelo as a blush and used the Pitaya shade as a lip gloss since it was a little bold for my usual day to day as a blush. I'm thrilled to have a product that makes a great 2-in-1 in my makeup bag now! I'd absolutely try out more shades for noth cheeks and lips! As a lip gloss, it is sheer but not unnoticeable and lasted a good while."

I applied the balm using a blush brush to achieve a more natural, blended look; however, you can apply directly to the cheek for a more bold look. I was pleasantly surprised that this formula dried down as much as it did on my oily skin- I was expecting it to feel more wet. And guess what? Surprise! I’m also wearing it on my lips 🤭 it’s safe for cheeks and lips. Overall, I think I prefer the powder color fuse blush for everyday wear, but this formula is a fun change!"

			"review_text": "This formula has to be one of the best things to come out of 2024 so far and I’ll tell you why. I was gifted two shades (‘Glassy Rosette’ and ‘Glassy Acai’) of this product by Haus Labs but my review is not biased in any way.  Starting off with pigmentation - these are extremely pigmented yet easily blendable. Typically, super pigmented cream blush formulas tend to be difficult to blend out and work with but these blend out seamlessly. In the attached photos, I didn’t apply a lot on the cheeks (shade ‘Glassy Rosette’) and ended up with the most perfect natural flush with just the right amount of pigment. The finish on these are dewy and natural without being sticky. They melt into your base without lifting or disturbing your foundation underneath which is so important in a good cream/balm formula. These also give a natural plumping effect when applied. Yet Another unique quality of these is that they’re super versatile! I love how I can use this formula on both my cheeks and lips to create monochromatic looks. These being a 2-in-1 product essentially is very convenient. And to top it all off, these are infused with an array of hydrating and nourishing skincare ingredients! Definitely my new favorite blush formula without a doubt. They’re perfect for summer in every sense of the word!   Attached is a selfie of myself wearing the shade ‘Glassy Rosette’ on the cheeks and both ‘Glassy Acai’ and ‘Glassy Rosette’ on the lips. I’m also wearing the Triclone Skin Tech concealer in shade ‘01 Fair Neutral’. The two products mesh together beautifully. I loosely lined my lips with ‘Glassy Acai’, blended that out, and then blotted ‘Glassy Rosette’ in the center of my lips for a blurred, natural look. I’ve also included a picture of swatches of the two shades on my arm."

But she is truly beautiful and blended seamlessly - I feel like I need to throw on a sundress and have a drink on the beach with my pink cheeks & lips. The color glides on over some concealer and color corrector I had on. I found any blush brush worked well to blend in but also worked well when tapped in with my fingers. Some liquid blushes are difficult to blend and easy to apply too much. Found one swipe across my cheeks delivered the right amount of product.  I even added some to my lips with a lip brush and some lip oil on top for an overall pinky punch look.  Though Haus gifted me the shade Pitaya and Pomelo I will be grabbing additional shades!!"

Thankfully, that wasn’t the case!! This is truly a one of a kind product that gives the skin a beautiful luminosity while also being very pigmented and at the same time not being greasy or sticky at all.

			"review_text": "I received this item in exchange for an honest review. I personally was a little skeptical about this product. I tend to like single purpose items, but I understand the versatility and options a multi-purpose item can hold, especially when you’re on the go, and this item definitely has that. My initial reaction to seeing the product was that it follows the color scheme, imagery, and feel of the latest products. It was larger than I expected, which was nice since it made it easier to hold/grip, however opening and closing weren’t as smooth or easy (slightly cheapened the feel/experience). I did like that it had the color strip in the middle of the tube so you could see the shade whenever it’s sitting on your makeup counter without having to flip it over to find the one you want to use. As for use of this product, it was a definite first for me since I have only ever used powder blush (haven’t tried cream or liquid). Even with that lack of experience it was easy to apply and learn how to make it match my preferred look when it comes to blush application. It’s a buildable cream that didn’t streak, become patchy, or lift my foundation. I applied it directly to the cheek and diffused it out with a brush then softened the edges with my foundation sponge. Took a little time blending it out but I would chalk that up to my lack of technique and familiarity with balm blush over the actual product. Once applied for a good 30 minutes it felt as if I had balm/Vaseline on my cheeks yet once it completely dried down the feeling wasn’t as noticeable, almost became more powdery-like and held to my cheek. As for anyone with sensitive skin, I would say this is a safe try. I just came off a huge flare-up/breakout and this didn’t worsen or cause any further reaction. It’s gentle on the skin. Lastly, I tried using it on my lips. It felt soft, non-greasy or thick. Overall, I think it gives options outside the realm of powder blushes and is more cost-effective since it’s multifunctional."

When I opened the tangelo orange blush i recieved, I was pleasantly surprised to see the color when opened was so vibrant it looked like a crayon. I have fair skin so I wasn't expecting an orange blush to work on my cheeks or lips, but it surprisingly looked great both ways! A truly beautiful formula and one of my favorite blushes of all time. I also love the skincare benefits as it makes me feel good to know the products I use are making a difference in my skin. While buying a 34 dollar blush is not a necessity, if you feel like splurging on a dewy blush this is the best option. The packaging is also very convenient and in line with their previous designs."

A little goes a long way, which is perfect because a pop of color is what I prefer, and it also means I'll get a lot of use out of the product before needing to replace. The Glassy Hibiscus color was gorgeous, I loved it on my skin town paired with my foundation, highlighter and bronzer - it's the perfect addition!

These are also very comfortable to wear on the lips if you like to match your lip color to your blush color.

These blushes are incredibly pigmented (especially the darker colors) so you might need to apply less than you think. The serum base formulation with 70%+ skincare ingredients is evident as it melts into the skin, glides on with no effort, and blends easily with fingers or brush.   I tried shades Glassy Lilac and Glassy Watermelon (pictured), they are both beautiful vibrant colors that can be made to look natural (with a light hand) or bold.     The color is long lasting and even though I have oily skin, the blush still achieves that glassy effect without looking overly shiny or feeling greasy which is very impressive.   Haus labs generously gifted this product for an honest review."

It was super glidey and smooth to apply and left a beautiful, natural skin-like glow. It was definitely hydrating to the skin and pretty water-resistant! Wore on my skin really well through the day. Even when I swatched the product on the back of my hand and washed my hands the color was still present.  It's definitely a sheer, buildable formula. I would not go into this expecting super high impact color payoff but that's actually what I like about it since it gives me more flexibility with how I want to use it.  I was pretty intimidated with the shade Pitaya for my skintone but ended up loving the sheerness so I could build it up.  Overall I'm super impressed with this formula and I will definitely be coming back for more shades."
