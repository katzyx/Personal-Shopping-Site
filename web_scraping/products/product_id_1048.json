			"review_text": "If you love pomelo and other citrus scents, along with earthy woods - this one is beautifully crafted! You first get a huge burst of juicy grapefruit peel without any bitterness and then it dries down into a lighter fresh citrus mixed with warm cedar/oud/vanilla and a touch floral finish. It‚Äôs perfect for a summer evening! Mix with Paradiso for a captivating citrus experience."
