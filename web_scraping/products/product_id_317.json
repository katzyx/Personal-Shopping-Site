			"review_text": "I bought this after I tried a few aerosol dry shampoo sprays that did almost nothing for my oily hair. I have very fine, stick straight hair that gets greasy looking sometimes as soon as 12 hours after I wash it. The only dry shampoo I’ve tried that worked well was a similar powder product, but it came in a bottle that made application difficult and messy. I was excited to give this product a try because it was similar in formula/ingredients to the powder that worked for me a while ago, but with an easier to use spray nozzle. When I first tried to apply it, I was not expecting so much product to come out so quickly - so definitely use caution for the first use, and make sure you’re not wearing dark clothes that could get the powder on them! After getting the hang of it, though, I can apply it without any mess. It is super easy to blend out even if there’s a lot in one spot (however I do have dark blonde hair, not sure how it looks on darker brown or black hair), and it even gives a bit of texture and volume which is exactly what my fine, straight hair needs! The fresh, fruity scent is heavenly to me. However, if you don’t enjoy scented products, you may not like that part of it. My hair looks nice and clean for much longer between washes compared to other aerosol dry shampoos or not using any product. Overall I think this product is perfect for ME and anyone else with lighter hair looking for a product to help extend time between washes and add a bit of texture and volume."

To me, it's a fruity type smell.   That being said, I think it's too expensive. I found a great alternative on amazon that has clean ingredients and the same style pump. plus its refillable.

I stopped using dry shampoo altogether because I get oily under 24 hours of washing and the buildup from product was killing the volume of my hair no matter the clarifying product that I used to try to get volume back to my roots. I color my hair and I use heat tools to dry and 3/7 days curl it so it has some kind of movement. LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING- I DON’T KNOW HOW I SURVIVED WITHOUT THIS. I bought it on a whim because I was looking for hair story powder but Sephora doesn’t sell it and I was already buying other products so I thought why not I’ll try it, if I hate it, I’ll just return it. You definitely have to follow instructions, apply 6 inches away and let sit for 30-60 seconds before working it into your scalp/brushing. It also kind of smells like starburst, wasn’t expecting that but a sweet surprise. I’m on day 4 and my hair has never looked better. I will say, you do have to brush it often to keep the volume, while my hair is thin, I have a lot of it so it does get heavy and brushing it with this with the product in I’ve noticed brings it back to life a bit. Overall, I’m sold, I’ll be a customer for life. This picture is on day 4- too stunned."

I’ve tried it two separate days with different levels of oily hair (medium thickness, long hair) and it does NOT absorb any oil, it almost creates a very thick bond with the oil. It leaves the hair with an almost hairspray like helmet. That’s with 4 pumps spread out and sprayed far away from the scalp. 2) the smell is ok for a shampoo or something that gets washed out, but is so strong and lingering for something right by your face all day 3) I didn’t notice any of the fairy dust shimmer, which I guess can be a good or bad thing. 4) leaves a MASSIVE white cast. I’ve brushed it in and shook my hair out and still a helmet head white cast.  5) the dispense nozzle isn’t great"

I have tried many kinds of dry shampoos with varying results -- including a couple of non-aerosol  ones like Bumble and Bumble, and Briorgio.  Nothing horrible about any of them.  Liked them just fine.  But either I didn't get enough umph out of them, they didn't last as long as I'd like, or the delivery system was weak -- the Bumble and Bumble? Please.  I'm supposed to sprinkle that on my scalp?  What do I do for the sides?  It was a neck breaking exercise. They worked, sure, but none of them were the whole package, you know?  Then I got THIS.  You just shake it up and shoot!  Hold it close in if you need a lot, further out if you need a dusting.  You can get your scalp or your length.  You can rub this in completely.  You can go forever on this. I recently had emergency eye surgery which meant I couldn't wash my hair (I could have gone to a salon, I guess) and went 3 weeks with this stuff.  After 3 weeks there was some stiffness in the hair at the scalp, no doubt, but you couldn't see it.  I'm not going to tell you I was shower fresh, but I could have gone out or done a virtual meeting no problem.    For best results shake it and dispense -- you're going to get a pretty good dose that first pump.  I saw somebody saying it just left a big dot on their hair.  Yup.  I can believe it.    I'd recommend doing your main part with that first few pumps -- where you need the most product.  I would also recommend that you give yourself a good rub or brushing after your done the application -- like a final all over thing.    This product is amazing.  I have received nothing to write this review."

Unfortunately, this product was overhyped and does not work like every influencer is raving about it. It adds so much grit to my hair that it feels as if it is texturized. I checked the label, and it is not branded as a texturizer. It makes my hair feel dirtier. I have tried using less of it; I have tried doing it the night before and then sleeping with it. I have tried to make this product work for the last month, and it is not working. The only upside to this product is the smell. It smells incredible. Maybe Dae should release a hair perfume in this scent instead of a dry shampoo that was overhyped on social media."

It also smells super clean, like you have just shampooed.  Highly recommend!"

I have tried training my hair, PH balancing shampoos...countless dry shampoos (Batiste, Kevin Murphy, Oribe, Amika, IGK,  Drybar, bumble&bumble, Dove, Colab, Klorane, verb, sephora brand etc...)  Dae Fairy Duster has taken the top spot for me. This is the ONLY dry shampoo that makes my hair LOOK as if it was freshly washed days later.   A couple things to note...   1. it took a minute to get used to the application but i am obsessed with this powder formula! A little goes a long way. Honestly you don't need the dae blending brush either - fingers work just fine! But make sure you let it sit for a minute before rubbing it in.   2. It also makes my hair/scalp feel a bit... starchy? but this does not affect the movement of your hair. Though it feels starchy, it does not feel heavy, crunchy, or dirty! I prefer this over aerosol shampoos.   3. For best performance, it's been really working for me to apply the dry shampoo immediately after I wash/blow dry my hair. My hair still looks and feels freshly washed the next morning.   also it smells SOOOOOOO lovely (Sweet and citrusy)!

			"review_text": "* I bought this product with my own money and have no affiliation to this company or product *  Here are the pros: this dry shampoo does as advertised. I applied this to very greasy, unwashed hair going on day number 3 of no washing - usually I wash every other day. The powders quickly absorbed the oil and made my hair look clean again. I also loved the smell of the product; it's light, clean, almost citrus-y in nature. I love almost all of the Dae products' smells.  Now for the cons: I can appreciate the idea of a non-aerosolized dry shampoo, but because of this, the application was very difficult to control. I ended up spending quite a bit of time being meticulous in dispensing this, as a small bottle is $30, but there was still a bit of fall out that felt wasteful. However, I could over look the component of the product if it weren't for the texture. This dry shampoo made my hair incredibly gritty and rough feeling, it feels almost as if I had applied my Bumble and Bumble texturizing spray. If you are able to tolerate that, then this should not be a problem for you. Another issue - this applied well in the morning when I first sprayed it in my hair, but around lunch time I saw what looked like many small, white flakes throughout my scalp that was a result of the dry shampoo. If you are someone with a lighter hair color, I do not think this will be a problem as it is more easily camouflaged, but for my black hair, it was unfortunately very noticeable.   Overall, this works in getting rid of oily hair, but not without its faults. It is not something I would reach for, but there are people who could tolerate the texture and the residue and I think this would work for them. Also, smells amazing."

So even with a brush or my fingers to blend it out, it leaves a white chalky residue in the hair.   2nd, I received this product on Tuesday Feb 27th. It’s Thursday February 29th and I only used this product twice and I’m already halfway through the bottle…I could understand if I used this a million times but it’s only been 2 days and I only sprayed this in my hair 4 times and it’s already half empty. Such a small product and come on for $30?! They need to make this product a lot bigger or taller like the traditional dry shampoos for this price.

I have fine, straight hair that gets oily fast so I was testing this out for a week and found that it helps reduce oil without drying out my scalp, which other dry shampoo powders tend to do. Other brands also don't always have a scent so the fact this makes my hair smell good with a lasting scent makes me so happy! The powder is ultra-fine yet lightweight as well, but because of that I had to reapply every day because the oiliness came back. Not such a bad thing though because with most dry shampoos, you need to reapply it. Not sure if this helped volumize my hair since I have fine, straight hair. As for the pump packaging, it makes it easy to disperse the product into your hair without dumping too much into one area. However when I received the product in the mail, the lid was open and half of the powder came out. Super sad about that. Definitely feel like the packaging needs to be improved, especially considering the cost! Overall this was a great dry shampoo and I'd recommend."

The first thing that caught my attention was the delightful scent – a subtle, refreshing fragrance that lingered without being overwhelming.   What impressed me the most was its effectiveness in reviving my hair without leaving a heavy residue. The lightweight formula absorbed excess oil effortlessly, leaving my hair looking and feeling refreshed. It gave my locks a noticeable lift, adding volume and texture without any chalky or sticky residue.   The application was easy and precise, thanks to the nozzle design that dispersed the product evenly. It didn't leave any white cast on my dark hair, which is often a concern with dry shampoos. I appreciated the fact that it didn't weigh down my hair or make it feel stiff, allowing for natural movement.  Another standout feature is the eco-friendly packaging – a commitment to sustainability that resonates with me. The compact size makes it convenient for on-the-go touch-ups, fitting seamlessly into my bag.  In conclusion, Fairy Duster Dry Shampoo from Dae has become a staple in my hair care routine. Its ability to refresh and add volume without compromising on a clean feel sets it apart. If you're looking for a reliable dry shampoo with a delightful scent and eco-conscious packaging, Dae's Fairy Duster is a fantastic choice."

My hair immediately looks refreshed and voluminous, and it smells so good. It’s also long lasting, and does not get oily immediately, I can go the day with fresh hair.

I like that the packaging is easy to travel with but the product is a bit hard to dispense neatly. The powder does leave a bit of white cast since I have really dark black hair. It does a relatively good job of absorbing all the oil but leaves it feeling stiff. I do notice more volume after using."

I have thick hair and am not prone to oil until ~3 days after washing. The powder appears stark white on my dark roots, however, blends in easily with fingers and then finished with a brush or comb. I wouldn’t say it’s the most heavy-duty, but for me, I really only need dry shampoo to refresh for an extra day or so between washes. The pump applicator takes a little getting used to but I think is ultimately less wasteful because I can concentrate where I’m applying. It does leave more buildup in my hair than regular dry shampoo, but that could be user error. It’s a little expensive for what it is but I think It’ll last a long time. I give it 4.5/5."

So I thought perfect, I can test out this new product. First, I LOVE that it is not in an aerosol can. The packaging is so effective and convenient. Love that it has a pump. Second, the scent, the scent is citrusy and lovely. Refreshing in the hair. Third, I have thick, color treated hair, that can be on the oily side. This product did not disappoint. I sprayed it throughout my hair, and it gave my hair a soft finish and volume at the roots. I will definitely be repurchasing in the future along with their dry shampoo blending brush. I have dark brown hair, so sometimes, these powders tend to just stick to one area of the scalp, but I feel like the blending brush will be a game changer."

I'll start with the positives here -- Dae's products all smell very strong, but it's a lovely scent to me, so I don't mind. This product does extend my hair between washes and doesn't cause too much build up for me on the scalp (I have thick hair as a note...I'm not sure this would be true for other hair types). I think this is a good dry shampoo and I always prefer a loose powder over aerosol. All of this is fine and good except the packaging on this is not great. It seems like it'd be a twist off at first, but it's not -- you have to pull off a cap, which can be difficult and I often accidentally twist off the top trying to get the cap off. It also dispenses too much product at once, which if not done carefully weighs down my hair because too much has been deposited. I just have to be extra careful with this dry shampoo, which I don't have to with some of my other favorites."

I am generally not a huge fan of scented dry shampoo but man, the scent in this one is so delicious that I don’t even mind. The pump mechanism will definitely squirt out a lot of product if you push it down all the way, so the best method is to use small, short, shallow pumps. I have super fine, thin, straight hair, that gets oily at the roots and since my hair is color treated , i try to wash only 3x week, so dry shampoo is a must.

It’s a dry powder that kind of poofs out when you press the pump. It is white so I thought it would make my hair look gray but it rubs in just as easily as a traditional dry shampoo. My hair is light brown but If you have black hair it might be more noticeable. I really like the scent, it smells fruity and a bit like citrus. It’s a nice fresh scent. It did a really good job soaking up excess oil in my hair. I also like that it’s a smaller container because it would be great for travel but you’d still get as many uses as a regular size aerosol spray."

Then I’ll massage it in or brush it out and style normally. The scent is gorgeous but doesn’t linger very long after applying.

I actually took a shower right after to get rid of the feeling in my hair. No matter how much I massaged/rubbed it in, the gritty feeling did not go away.

But on the flipside, it also seems to get rid of my oily scalp issues a lot better than any aerosol version. My application tip would be to apply this before you do any of your skincare, or make up because the dry shampoo dust can get on your face. I also want to mention the scent is really pleasing, but it does remind me of vitamin C tablets, which isn’t a bad thing."

When you pump it out, it tends to concentrate in one spot, and not at all like a dust poof like the description says. You have to vigorously rub it into your scalp just to try and spread it. I have blonde hair however even I can see a white cast left on my hair, instantly dulling my hair... Can only imagine what it'd look like on others with a shade of hair other than blonde. It feels like a heavy residue is sitting on my head and I couldn't wait to wash my hair at the end of the day.

The scent is also amazing, it has a hint of a sweet citrus smell that is not overpowering but helps with my hair refresh everyday!

I love to use this in between my wash days when my hair gets oily and I don’t have time to wash it . This dry shampoo has a unique texture. It’s a powder form that pumps out from the bottle . You just need to part your hair in sections and pump the product on your scalp. I then give my scalp a good massage and you have clean hair with a lot of volume . I love the citrus scent you get from this dry shampoo. My hair will never look flat and boring again thanks to DAE newest dry shampoo."

You could probably brush it out enough to get rid of the color but if in a rush that’s not ideal obviously. So make sure to put only one spray at a time and far from the head! Was able to restyle my hair after using this though and I’ll definitely be using this in the future on days I just can’t get myself to wash my hair lol. Scent is nice too!! Not overbearing very light and pretty :) I’d give this a 7/10 on dry shampoos for the scent, the bottle (which is awesome will def reuse the bottle), and that it does soak up grease. However loses points because the powder is white corn starch so it really leaves a lot of gray residue."

It is a non-aerosol transparent dry shampoo that absorbs oil, refreshes hair and extends styles while boosting volume. The fragrance includes Dae Hair’s warm Signature Citrus Scent. It is infused with notes of luminous citrus, orange blossom and vanilla. I am a huge vanilla lover so I could instantly pick up on the vanilla and I think this is why I like the fragrance so much! 🎀  This is so easy to apply and I love the dispenser as it sprays out great and applies the amount I need for each section. I was shocked and impressed with the amount of volume I had in my hair. My hair doesn’t feel overly dry, which I like and there is no white residue. There is no doubt this will be one of my go-to holy grail dry shampoos! As I prefer powder to aerosol. 🎀"

Light, citrus-y, but not fragrant enough that it’s going to interfere with your perfume or anything like that. It did a great job freshening up my very fine and straight hair without leaving it clumpy or weighed down. And the non-aerosol pump is fantastic and so much easier than other powder dry shampoos I’ve tried. However, the packaging does leave a bit to be desired as my product arrived having come open a bit and the powder is so fine that it’s hard to get out of the crevices in order to be able to fully close it again and there’s on odd lip on the bottle that doesn’t seem like it should be there. All of that to say - be mindful when you open it to do it correctly and maybe don’t toss this one in your purse or gym bag without checking that it’s closed really well first. But overall I’m very pleased and will definitely continue to use this!"

If your hair is dirty, and by dirty I basically mean oily- then you’ll likely have good use for this. Perhaps. It has a great fresh scent but it’s not something that lingers. At least I don’t smell it. Now.. This is quite literally powder in a bottle that sort of sprays out the way I picture mosquito spray. Not the same consistency ofc but a broad spray. However unlike traditional dry shampoos which have other ingredients this appears to be just powder. I don’t care if you hold it 2 feet from your head or 6 inches like it says, you WILL have what looks like you dunked your head in flour! I’m sorry but it’s true. If you have darker hair, or not light blonde hair you’ll probably be upset. My hair is light blonde and it looks like I sprayed white paint on my hair. This is a big no for me. Besides that, I have dry scalp and it feels like EVERY drop of natural oils were absorbed. Not cool. And I love Dae:(z"

I'm very excited that this is non-aerosol as I feel these products last longer compared to aerosol options (better bang for your buck: Dae says one of these equals 4 aerosols, and I -especially my wallet- would say that's my experience as well). Most non-aerosol options seem to be unscented, or at least very lightly fragranced, so I appreciate that Dae added a lovely, candy-like (to my nose) scent into this product.  It's also probably the easiest non-aerosol packaging that i've encountered. Somehow, they managed to make a pump vs a squeeze tube, which makes this SO much more easy to apply. It actually applies where you want it! Now, I will say that as a powder, you're likely going to want to brush this through a few moments after applying. I feel that in use, this both absorbs oils and also makes my relatively flat hair look more voluminous.  Again as a blonde, I seek out dry shampoo that makes my roots look less prominent. This did that for me, so I will note that this may not be the perfect option for brunettes (it's hard for me to gauge). However, I am extremely happy with this dry shampoo!"

My hair is long but extremely dry, the dry shampoos I’ve used in the past always leave my hair feeling even more brittle.

The Dae Fairy Duster Shampoo is in a spray container but a POWDER dry shampoo. I love this because I feel like I have more control on how much I’m using, where it goes, and it’s easier to blend in with your roots. The smell is floral and summery, which will be a staple in the summer because that’s when my hair is oiliest. I’m so excited to continue to use this product and see the long term effects! With first couple uses; I can already say this has improved my oily roots and made my hair smell/ feel so fresh with adding volume. It’s also the perfect size to throw in your purse or bag, yet lasts longer than your normal spray dry shampoos. Love this product!"

I use this mainly on day 2 and 3 to refresh my hair without having to wash it, and it gives me a clean, refreshed scalp every time and makes my hair easily to restyle. Also, for better results, I like to use it overnight! It does not irritate my scalp and doesn’t weight my hair down. In fact, it gives the roots lots of volume! I have naturally wavy hair with dry ends and normal scalp that usually gets greasy on day 3-4. Highly recommend!"

My hair texture is very oily on the roots but dry at the ends and i have dandruff, i also have wavy hair and have curly after wash day, This helps so much with the grease because of the fact the top of my hair gets very oily by day 3. My hair still feels very soft on top but it doesn’t look oily neither feel oily. My hair was very easy to restyle afterwards and looks so cute because i’m never able to to do a hairstyle with oily hair and it comes out bad if it’s oily, so it was super easy to do a very natural style afterwards and made it looks good without it looking the way it usually does.

Infused with sweet notes of luminous citrus, orange blossom, and vanilla, the fragrance transports me to sunlit mornings spent squeezing fresh juice by hand, barefoot afternoons in wild orchards, and tranquil evenings as citrus trees sway with the breeze. The warm, floral aroma perfectly complements the overall experience.  I appreciate the thoughtful design of the dispenser, which releases the product with a magical poof. It's a whimsical touch that makes the application process enjoyable. As someone who likes to skip wash days when possible, the DAE Hair Fairy Duster Dry Shampoo has seamlessly earned its place as my go-to solution for maintaining fresh and voluminous hair."

The powder dry shampoo is so much better at volumizing my roots, without being crunchy and it works into the scalp so easily. It has the classic divine Dae scent! I also love that it’s small enough to be travel size but big enough to last long because you don’t have to use a lot at once."

			"review_text": "This Dry Shampoo has actually become my favorite for managing my straight, thin, quick-to-get-oily hair. I usually wash my hair every two days cause it gets oily so quickly! I tried this shampoo for a week, and honestly, my hair feels super fresh, clean, and surprisingly light (I mean, it doesn’t weigh down my hair as other dry shampoos), fixing the oiliness and volume issues I usually deal with (I have long, thin, straight hair, so the oily, no-volume struggle is real). It gets rid of excess oil and gives my hair a nice little light volume boost, making it easy to achieve the look I want with my thin, long hair. The lightweight formula and the bottle made as a spray make applying it easy! Genius idea! And the scent is sooo good. It's a light, fresh fragrance that gives off spa vibes. It's not too strong and it makes me feel like I just left a fancy spa salon. I would definitely recommend it because it’s not a strong spray with a scent that many can be sensitive to, it’s super easy to apply, and does its job with oily hair very well! I'd say it has become a top pick and a must-have in my hair care routine. Check it out if you experience daily oily hair issues and want your hair to feel fresh and clean and get a little extra volume."
