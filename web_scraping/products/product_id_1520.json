			"review_text": "68 is my favourite scent and the savings of this set were too good to miss! I looove the fragrance and lotion--they both smell great and last a decent amount of time. I also appreciate the full size of the perfume too. The body wash is really nice and I do like it but I don't know if I would repurchase it for it's regular price--I got it because of the deal but I don't think it's worth it on it's own. I personally am a Dove body wash girl but it was nice to try!! Overall highly recommend!"
