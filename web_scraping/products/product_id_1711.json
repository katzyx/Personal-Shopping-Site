	"about": "Fragrance Family:Warm & Spicy.Scent Type:Woody Spices.Key Notes:Black Spices Complex, Green Resinous Accord, Incense Resinoid.Fragrance Description:Spicebomb Night Vision‘s addictive signature crosses the line of intensity and gets ultra green. The aromatic fougere heart is now twisted with an intense green resin accord for a deep and dark addiction. On top, the fragrance unleashes an electric freshness of lemon essence, which gives an explosive contrast to the iconic black spices complex..About the Bottle:Taking the green light of night-vision technology as its design inspiration, Spicebomb gets its own image enhancement. The distinctive grenade bottle is reinterpreted in the emerald green tint of optical technology that merges into black-colored glass..About the Fragrance:Creating a sensual scent to seduce even in the dark, perfumers Nathalie Lorson and Pierre Negrin of Firmenich imagined a fougere, woody scent—the masculine family of scents.",
	"ingredients": "Alcohol, Parfum / Fragrance, Aqua / Water / Eau, Benzyl Salicylate, Linalool, Limonene, Benzyl Alcohol, Ethylhexyl Salicylate, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Coumarin, Citronellol, Hydroxycitronellal, Benzyl Benzoate, Alpha-Isomethyl Ionone, Benzyl Cinnamate, Citral, Eugenol, Geraniol, Cinnamal.",
	"how_to_use": "Suggested Usage:.-Fragrance is intensified by the warmth of your own body. Apply in the creases of your knees and elbows for a longer-lasting, stronger scent.&nbsp;.-After applying, avoid rubbing or dabbing skin. This breaks down the fragrance, causing it to wear off more quickly.&nbsp;.-If you prefer placing fragrance on your wrists, be sure to reapply after frequent hand-washing, as this tends to rinse off the scent.&nbsp;.-Replace fragrance after 12 months. Expired perfumes more than a year old lose the integrity of the original scent... Eau de Toilette or Eau de Parfum?: .The difference lies in the volume of perfume oil. While EDT contains five to nine percent, EDP contains more, usually eight to 14 percent. EDPs, therefore, last longer and smell more intense.",
