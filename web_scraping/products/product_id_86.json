I just signed up for a subscription of it for every two months. I ‚ù§Ô∏è this serum and this line which I think people just don't know about. I used to see it in Department stores but the inventory was always a problem. Sephora to the rescue! And I love the speedy delivery and service that Sephora give me. I ordered this serum and it only took 2 days to land at my door. kudos to Sephora for such remarkable service and range of excellent products. I will update my review just in case I react to the plant based retinol. Hope not because this serum is wonderful!"

The one caveat is, it has been my experience that if you want to use an eye cream with this it is best to use one from Beautybio. I was using Beholder until I ran out and then while I waited for my Beautybio order to arrive I used a different eye cream. The result when I tried to apply concealer was not ideal. It creased and pilled. This never happened when I used the Beautybio eye serum and Beholder eye cream. Despite that I will not give up using this product. It is too good."

This comment made me realize that I had an issue and needed to find a solution.   I wasn‚Äôt sure if it would work but after three days, I could see a noticeable difference. I put the Eyelighter in the fridge so the cream is cool when I apply it to my eye. I use the tool to gently apply the cream and gently push around my eye. I can feel the fluids under my eyes move and my eyes instantly are less puffy. It‚Äôs almost like the fluid in my bags are being pushed out and back into my system. The cream brightens the area around my eyes and reduced the dark circles.   I‚Äôve been using the tool five times a day for two weeks and have seen a major difference. This is definitely one of my top three favorite skincare products."

This may very well be the next item on that list! When I first got it, I wasn‚Äôt exactly sure what to expect. I hadn‚Äôt read a lot of information and was mostly just excited to try something new. In the beginning I was only using it once a day, in the morning, after washing my face and before putting on my make up. I was blown away at the results! The difference it made in my under eye area, especially by the end of the day, was incredible. Where normally my make up would somewhat settle into the fine lines (aka wrinkles and creases) in the under eye area, by the end of the day‚Ä¶it stopped that completely. Instead of my eye area looking ‚Äútired‚Äú by the end of the day, my make up looked just as good, if not better, by the end of the day! I am beyond impressed!  I decided to see it what difference it would make if I started using it twice a day. I realized quickly that not only did I still have the benefit of the impact on my eye make up‚Ä¶ But my under eye area simply looked brighter and fresher. My circles under my eyes were are far less pronounced. I love this stuff! I am hooked!"

The Eyelighter Concentrate provides a quick, visible difference to my under eyes. This product brightens my under eyes while also plumping and smoothing out the fine lines. I truly notice results within seconds of use and the skin feels so soft. If I do apply concealer it lays down beautifully and I don't have to worry about my makeup getting into creases and creating lines.  I also love that this product takes up practically no space in my toiletry bag when traveling."

The depuffing tool also provides a nice cooling effect, which is that touch of self care we all need in our lives. I would apply with the tool and then blot to set in with my fingers and found that was the best approach for me. For me, it's winter and the skin around my eyes is more dry than usual, so I actually added on with an additional moisturizer for extra hydration. I don't think that'll be necessary in other seasons. The product itself sometimes would get stuck on the top of the depuffing tool, but I may have been using too much. Otherwise, it felt great, helped my concealer stay put, and made me look more alive first thing in the morning. I highly recommend if brightening is a solution you're needing!"
