The only downside to this product is that after 7 months of use I dropped it on the floor and it broke... I will have to buy it again because it does its job very well and is worth all the money. Above all If you want to look like a shining pearl, you must buy it but be careful to not drop it."

The pros are that it is a straight metallic highlight with no pigment, meaning that it would look great on any skin tone. However, if you textured skin on your cheek area, you might not like the way this looks on you (speaking from personal experience). I also tried the Benefit Dandelion Twinkle and it looks way better on my textured cheek! It has no background pigment and instead of being metallic, it' almost looks like a superfine glitter. I would say the sparkles are so fine that it would look great for a no-makeup makeup look. Even though I don't like it as much as the other, I kind of wish Tickle came in a mini cause I definitely would have purchased it. I suggest you try both on in store to see which one works best for you."

It is so pretty, without looking either overly glittery (I am definitely too old for that!) or looking so subtle that I can barely see the slightest difference whatsoever on my face. I use it on the tops of my cheekbones, across the top of my forehead, a little bit down the bridge of my nose, and, even, a small amount in the center of whatever eyeshadow I am wearing, to give just a subtle little pop in the center of my lids, without looking overdone.

For background, I'm a huge highlighter girl but the past several years I've exclusively stuck with liquid highlighters as I just haven't been impressed with many powder highlighters on the market due to their tendency to not last the whole day, have underwhelming colour pay off, or sometimes just sit weird on my skin. However this lil dude has changed my mind and made his way into my top 2 all time favourite highlighters. The texture is buttery smooth, the colour is a perfect shade of champagne (not too cool, not too warm), and of course the nostalgic Benefit packaging. This will definitely last me over 1.5 years even with heavy use and honestly beats 99% of the highlighters that have a huge cult following for a smaller price tag and without the chalkiness I find many of them have."

If you're like me and layer multiple highlighters for a date night or night, the Twinkle is perfect for the base layer. HOWEVER, I felt like I always had to go in with my Becca highlighter to make it pop. Until I found Cookie, this and the Twinkle together are amazing. I am not even kidding, I've only used that combo since December when I purchased Cookie. Super smooth, yet incredibly blinding. The shade is perfect if you're looking for something champagne-light gold, I cannot stop using it. I may need to buy a back up.. Highly recommend if you love a buildable, blinding highlight!"

A gold pearl is a good description for it when you swatch it on skin but when you actually apply it as a highlight it is more silver for sure.

It is a lighter colored highlight, for darker skin it will probably have a whiter base rather than a beige or gold undertone but still can be worn beautifully. It can be a blinding highlight if needed to be. I personally tend not to like blinding highlights but this one if applied and distributed with the finger it becomes a wet and natural glow and it is beautiful!

I have other highlights that I love so I returned this. I have never liked benefits big bulky packaging but the brush in this felt much softer than their other products so in this case it didnu2019t bother me as much that they have the brush in this.

It is a very shiny highlighter. It has a weird, almost cream-like consistency, I think that's because the first ingredient is dimethicone. The consistency is actually making the highlighter a little difficult to apply, almost patchy with brushes. I think this is probably best applied with your fingers.  I still love this highlighter though. There's something different about the way it glows, and it doesn't really exaggerate textures that much like a lot of the really shiny highlighters.

I also like to use it on my eyes as an inner corner highlight or on the lid for a pop.

It is so beautiful and I was hoping it would come out as a single because it was one of the reasons I bought the benefit cheekleader palette in the first place. It was so hyped but it did not disappoint. It is a beautiful champagne-y, super foiled highlight and I love it. A little does go a long way though."

This is a wham bam, glow to the gods, shine into space type highlighter so if you like something subtle or more sheeny then this is not for you. This is so intense from the get to, no build up required, donu2019t need to wet your brush. This doesnu2019t feel extremely powdery, kinda like the color pop formula but not quite as bouncy and more pressed but still that light and airy formula. I would say this is a light champagne shade, not gold, not silver, but light champagne. Itu2019s stunning and thereu2019s nothing bad I can say about it."
