I love that it works so well without any harsh chemicals. Itu2019s definitely a splurge, but totally worth it for a weekly glow boost!"

I wish I could use when I prep my skin for my make up because I feel it leaves my skin extremely moisturized from within. The container is small but you only need a little bit. In the beginning I use a lot because couldnu2019t feel it on my skin. I definitely recommend it to be used a couple of times per week. Your skin will feel more glowy and nurture. Your make up will look flawless!"

This small but mighty face mask by Tata Harper is very effective at accomplishing both things. The mask has a gellish texture and a little goes a long way. I applied it with my fingers all over my face and my neck. As time went by, the mask started to dry into a shiny and tight veil. I waited twenty minutes for it to fully dry. I was amazed at how clear and soft my skin felt and looked after rinsing it out with warm water. I used it once or twice a week with great alike results. I think it makes a great addition to a routine for a home spa experience. I have seen my skin less congested and even made some scarring heal quicker. My only con is the price for the size of the jar."

My dark spots have definitely faded and in effect, my whole face looks so much more glowy. Especially in the morning, I feel my skin is usually dull and any dark spots are very noticeable. 20 minutes of this mask every few days has made such a difference! The only reason Iu2019m giving this 4 instead of 5 stars is because I did notice some mild irritation on my neck, however that is normal for me this time of year, as my dry skin gets exacerbated by the cold and dry weather and in turn becomes very sensitive. The smell of the mask is incredible and the gelatinous texture felt so cooling and relaxing! It truly felt like a facial in a jar and I will be recommending this to all of my friends. It feels very powerful if that makes senseu2026 I actually feel like itu2019s doing its job while itu2019s sitting on my skin which I love."

You can see the diffusion of the hyperpigmentation at the top of my forehead in the before and after pics and my flaky cheeks are almost 100% smooth!  The Resurfacing Mask can be used up to 3 times per week, which speaks to the gentle, skin-friendly nature of the product. The texture in the jar is bouncy, kind of like gelatin, but it spreads easily and melts right onto the skin during application. The mask dries evenly and gradually creates a feeling of tightening/toning. The scent is earthy with a cooling note and rinses cleanly with warm water.   I love that this mask uses natural and certified organic ingredients, the oil and minerals and sustainably and ethically sourced, and even the packaging is planet friendly.  Tata Harper has really created a skincare dream team with their lineup of products."

To me, it's more like a gel moisturizer, very light, hydrating & soaking into my skin, and I feel like I have nothing on my face. My skin feels so nice after rinsing, it's cool to touch & feel plumped. Can't help but keep touching my face. My skin tone looks better and brighter.

Enter the Tata Harper Resurfacing Mask! This stuff is literally a spa in a jar! Iu2019ve always heard amazing things about this brand and now I know why. After just one use, my pores were deeply cleansed of all their gunk and appeared smaller and my skin was smooth and glowing. Itu2019s like having a mini facial at home. I slather on a layer and enjoy some tv for 20 minutes and after I rinse it off I have brand new glowing skin! As someone with a full time job who is always on the go, I appreciate that I can completely revamp my skin in only 20 minutes. While this gives great results, itu2019s still gentle on the skin unlike other masks that make similar claims. While this is on the pricey side, itu2019s a great investment for your skin and I highly recommend it."

As someone who suffers from hormonal acne, I tend to break out a lot by my chin, resulting in acne scarring afterwards. I implemented this Tata Harper resurfacing mask and the BHA truly was a chemical exfoliant that cleared my pores and cleared my skin. I have dry skin, especially in the winter months so I'm fairly cautious as to what I use for my acne treatments but I did not have any irritation after using this product. The mask has a thick clay like texture which is great to absorb all the excess oils on your skin. I enjoy using this at night once a week as I have the most buildup on my face at the end of the day."

I used their daily cleanser and scrub to take it off but I didn't have any issues with burning or redness from the mask. The packaging is lux and it has a nice scent to it; just note it is glass and a bit heavy so don't drop it. My skin is normally oily and can get some congestion around my chin and nose, and this mask helped with both. I also didn't strip my skin or dry my face out after using."

You only need a small dab so the jar will last quite a bit of time. I put this on for 15 minutes or so and then dry it off and my skin feels porcelain and so smooth. This is perfect for oily skin people who want a silky smooth skin texture.

I donu2019t always do masks, since they can be time consuming and sometimes I just want to wash my face and go to bed but oh my goodness this one is so worth it. The Tata Harper Resurfacing Mask will leave your skin feeling silky smooth and hydrated."

Itu2019s really easy to remove and doesnu2019t get stuck in your eyebrows, or leave little sneaky patches of mask like almost everyone I own, lol.   I applied it and left it on per instructions, and didnu2019t feel anything. I was expecting to feel some tingling or something given its name and promise. It was very soothing and calming- I would recommend it for that. The mask has Arnica, Rose Otto, and Calendula in it which are all super soothing. My skin was already looking pretty glowy from the Regenerating cleanser Iu2019ve been using as well, so maybe it just has a very subtle effect in general, and didnu2019t do much for me. I think my before and afters reflect the regenerating cleanser the most, but no doubt that my skin looks brighter after using both."

Another thing I appreciated about this product was the quality packaging. It genuinely felt so luxurious and made me feel excited to use this mask.

What I did at first is use it 3 consecutive nights as a part of a routine after the Regenerating Cleanser and found that to be a bit much for my skin type. At first, I knew I was purging. But knowing that some skincare products could do that I switched to every other day but still ended up only using it 2x a week. I found this to be the most effective for me. It worked well with micro peel that is not visible unless you look very very closely. I know that it aided in removing and exfoliating my dead skin cells. It might come in a small jar but with the amount that you need and the number of times you would need to use this is making it worth it. If you consider cost per use and its effects it is definitely worth the splurge. I would suggest to be more conservative in the usage of this because its effectivity did not rely on how many times I have used it but with the correct amount needed that my skin type will be able to handle."

It has a gel texture as well, and i do not need a lot of products, which means this will last quite a while for me.

Tata Harper uses natural ingredients with a focus on being gentle to even the most sensitive skin. I got to try another of the Tata Harper masks, this time it was the resurfacing mask. This is labeled as a glow treatment mask with BHA and Pomegranate enzyme. I love this combo as it will be exfoliating but gentle and willow bark will help control any active breakouts. This is definitely best for oily, acneic or congested skin but safe for all skin types like most other Tata Harper products. Willow Bark is the second ingredient on this mask, the label says use up to 3x a week but if you have dry skin I would probably use it once a week or even every other week depending on what other exfoliation products youu2019re already using. This mask is a gel consistency and comes in a jar so you have to scoop out what you need.

I like that the ingredients are clean and gentle and not too harsh for a chemical exfoliant.  Itu2019s one of the gentle resurfacing masks that I used!

I have been using this mask two times per week snd I could see results since the first use. I have oily acne prone skin, but sometimes it just looks dull. I was able to get instant glow after the first use. This face mask has a gel like texture, or like a fruit puree and it even smells kind of fruity. I just apply a layer of this mask and leave it on for 20 minutes and then rinse off. After it dries it does not feel tight on the skin at all. After rinsing, my skin feels hydrated and looks healthy and glowy. No more dull skin. This review was collected as part of a promotion"

This mask has pink clay which absorbs excess oils from the surface of the skin while also blurring pores. It works best on oily and combination skin, however, it is also good to use it on other skin types as a spot treatment use it once a week and my skin has never felt better! My acne has significantly reduced and my pores have shrunk. My overall skin health has improved so much since using this mask. The mask comes in a luxury, glass bottle and using the product really elevates my skincare routine! The only downside I could mention is that the mask does not have a long shelf life unfortunately; my jar expires 14 months from now which is a very little time. Overall, it is a great choice to calm acneic skin!"

When you open the jar, the mask actually looks like a smooth lip balm. It goes on feeling moisturizing but dries down very quickly.

I could tell my face looked smoother and healthier after just one use. The natural smell of the mask is nice. It is great that it works on my rough skin and helps reduce the enlarged pores.

It is stated that the true color came from pink clay which works to purify the skin by removing excess oil to minimize the appearance of pores without overstripping.  After cleanser, I applied a thin layer of gel on over my face and it got dry immediately that I could fell nothing. I left it for 10 minutes then rinse by warm water. I can tell I was very easy to rinse off without any greasing like others masks I have ever tried before.  My skin was tightened, less pores and smoother. Especially I realized that my oily was absorbed well. Skin need moisturizer after mask. I will use the mask 2-3 days a week as recommended to avoid skin getting dry much. One bonus point is for scent for mask so relaxing and gently. **This review was collected as part of a promotion."

This mask left my skin feeling refreshed and glowy! I did not experience any sensitivity which is a huge plus to me since I have had allergic reactions to some masks in the past. The only flaw of this one is the amount of time suggested to keep it on. As a mom, my self care routine can be in a time crunch sometimes so 20 minutes is a bit on the lengthier side for me. Although the time is long, I still recommend this mask as it is very effective and refreshing!"

I like that you can use it on its own or layer on top of the regenerating cleanser for an extra boost. After several uses, my skin looks visibly brighter and even. This did not make my skin feel overly tight either. At $68 for 1 oz, itu2019s pretty pricey for a face mask.

I am a 42-year-old female with rosacea and acne-prone skin, and this has become a new favorite in my skincare routine. I have to be careful with products that contain actives, because my skin can overreact to these products. I have tried other resurfacing masks without success, but this one has been great! It is a gentle exfoliating mask that uses natural ingredients to smooth and brighten, as opposed to harsh chemical peels. I love how it leaves my skin feeling so soft and glowing. The gorgeous glass jar is always one of my favorite features with Tata Harper products. Though itu2019s a bit of an investment, the results and high-quality formulation make it a worthwhile product for those who have sensitivity to other formulations."

I applied in the shower right before I got out, let sit for 20 min then rinsed off at the sink.   I noticed the glow that the resurfacing mask gave me but also the size of my pores shrunk (especially on my nose) after about a week of using it every other day.

But maybe that's not necessary and it's more eco-friendly to not include one! I'm a really big fan of the fact the ingredients are 100% natural and how it's an enzyme and BHA exfoliant because this type is less common. Enzymes are especially nourishing and brightening for the skin. I will say that the price point is pretty steep: $68 for 1 ounce. And the directions say to use a thick amount so this would only last you a few uses if you're following it like that. I used a thin amount, personally; but to each their own."

Using the Tata Harper Resurfacing Mask is such a luxurious experience from start to finish. I love the cooling sensation that you feel on your face when you put it on, and then as it dries it tightens and there is a slight tingle. Then as you wash it off it's still thick and almost gel-like so getting to massage it in one more time is nice before it washes away. I've noticed my skin looks really glowy and healthy after I use the mask, which I love! I was hoping to see a change in the overall texture of my skin and pores, especially the pores on my nose since those are the most noticeable, but so far I have not noticed much of a difference.   HOWEVER, I swear now looking at the before to after photos the smile lines on my face look way less and this has been the only change I have made to my skincare routine so - consider me sold because I am too scared to get botox so if this works instead, sign me the heck up!

I use face masks often but never feel like anything helps my skin glow. This really boosted my skin's radiance. I have used it three times a week so far and it helped unblock my pores and brightened my skin. There has also been a noticeable difference in improving my skin's texture where it is now more smooth than rough. I love that I can use it any time of the day. It is easy to apply as well as easy to rinse off. It is also a big plus point that it contains botanical ingredients that are vegan and cruelty-free. I give this resurfacing mask five stars for rejuvenating my skin with a beautifully radiant glow. This review was collected as part of a promotion."

Iu2019ve yet to meet a mask (until now) that exfoliates and truly lifts away dead skin while still keeping my skin hydrated. Additionally, I can tell by using the resurfacing mask that it does not dry my skin out further. There are a lot of resurfacing masks out there but I find they are usually drying and compromising to the skin barrier. Which, makes another issue arise with a compromised skin barrier!   However, this is not the case with Tata Harper. The gel like consistency makes it easy to Apple and remove. My makeup looks absolutely fantastic as well after I use it. A tip from me would be to use the mask when you know you have an event or a day where you want your makeup to go on flawlessly and stay put! Something about the way this masks exfoliates that makes for your foundation and makeup to look so much better and last longer!  This review was collected as part of a promotion"

When I first received this product, I was instantly obsessed with the high quality, beautiful packaging. The floral detail on the lid is so delicate and sweet. I also love that the gold product color mixed with the green packaging reminds me of a caramel apple. This instantly set my standards for the product high.  Personally, I deal with dull skin that comes from having normal to dry skin. I also experience texture on my forehead area. I crave the radiant, glass skin look. I have used a handful of exfoliants with BHA although none have been as gentle on the skin as this one. I have used this three times a week for the last 2.5 weeks and I love that it does not have the intense chemical smell that most exfoliants do. I feel like the resurfacing mask is a high-grade, spa quality product. My skin is glowing and the texture on my forehead after just a couple of weeks is nearly gone and smoothed out. I have never had results like this.  The only con to the product for me is the price u2013 I have 2 weeks max left of the product if I use it the recommended 2-3 times a week. In total, I will get 4-5 weeks of use out of this product for which I personally could not justify paying. This would be more of a luxury purchase for me that I would purchase 1-2 times a year at most rather than a regular rebuy. Overall, I would recommend it as a great, high-end product to treat yourself to if it is in your budget."

At 47, I deal with sunspots and wear a lot of sunscreen due to spending significant time swimming outdoors. This mask, with its pomegranate enzymes, dissolves buildup and gives an immediate brightening effect.  This mask provides a deep clean, radiates my skin, and thoroughly cleansing my pores leaving a luminous complexion. I leave it on for 20 minutes and then rinse with warm water. The citrusy scent, likely from the pomegranate enzymes, is refreshing and invigorating. The packaging is luxurious and adds a touch of elegance to my routine.  Since using this mask, I've noticed a significant reduction in blackheads and the gunk beneath my pores. It feels like a spa treatment at home, and my skin looks clearer and more radiant.

It helps my make up stay smoother and helps to have a glowing finish. As itu2019s already help to clear out oil in pores, it helps my make up look better and stay longer. However, I strongly recommend to use sunscreen after using this mask. Since the ingredients have BHA and AHA, you should apply sunscreen to protect your skin from uv lights. Itu2019s a nice experience to test out this product and I definitely repurchase it in the future."

I like the thick jelly like substance of the mask.  I was not a fan of the scent, but once you apply it to your face, it is not as strong as it is in the jar. The scent is not bad, but strong in the jar. I am a little disappointed, because I did not notice a glow after using the mask. Maybe it takes longer than a couple weeks to notice. I still have hope for it, but I have not noticed it yet. I will note that even though I do not notice the glow, my face does feel cleaner and softer after rinsing it off!

I was very excited to receive this product but my excitement turned into unpleasant experience when I opened the product. There was no secure tape outside or on the jar itself that which prevent tampering. I  was surpired to see there is no seal of security on the lids as majority of skin products now comes with a seal on lid that makes sure that product is reached with out tampering to the customer. I took the jar out, the product was  leaked out,  gloopy, dried out products under the rim of lid. Look like the product is used and then sent back and I received it now. The absence of seal and leaked product raises doubts.   When I opened the lid the product was smeared inside of lid and falling off. There was a small transparent lid that supposed to sit on the top to prevent this accident, but it was struck in the top of lid. There was spatula or brush provided with the mask. Not at all a pleasant experience of unboxing. Luxury was missing.   The  mask  comes in a 30 ml glass pot. Love the green colour ans golden lid combo and it looks beautiful. The outer packaging is deceptive as  this pot comes in a 50 ml box. They should have used a small pack instead if putting an insert and fixing the 30 ml pot in a 50ml I have dry to nornmal skin and some pigmentation spots. The mask is very gentle on my face . I had no irritation on face . I love the fragrance . It has gel formula and I applied it with a silicone spatula which makes application easy and smooth. It felt like a peel off mask as it was drying and I noticed some tightness while it was drying. After 20 minutes I washed, skin looked clear and it was not dry. I didnu2019t not see any big difference that was noticeable. I used twice a week.  I like the product itself but in whole it not worth the money neither the quantity nor the experience"

I believe the less chemicals we put on our skin the better it looks and feels. The texture is like gel , very smooth and spreads easily on the skin. I used it 3 times a week and l loved the look of my skin after: refreshed, radiant, it also looks glowy after you wash off the mask. I think to see the difference you have to use it at least a month. The only minus is that itu2019s only 1 fl.oz and after using it for 4 times not much is left."

What I appreciate most is that this mask is specially formulated for reactive, stressed, sensitive, or dry skin types. It's hypoallergenic, dermatologist-tested, and vegan, so I feel confident and safe using it on my sensitive skin. Plus, it's free from gluten, wheat, soy, nut derivatives, fragrances, essential oils, and over 85 common allergens and irritants, making it an ideal choice for anyone with specific skin concerns or allergies.  In summary, the Tata Harper Resurfacing Mask is a game-changer. It delivers smooth, radiant skin after just one use and offers a delightful, minty sensory experience. I highly recommend it to anyone looking to revive dull, stressed skin and achieve a healthy, glowing complexion!"

Initially I was worried that I wouldn't get a change to see results in my skin because the jar is 1 ounce, but I quickly realized a little goes a long way. I can easily spread a thin layer over my entire face and what I love is how fast it dries! I was very surprised by the scent, it smells like Citronella which I do like. As it was drying I felt some tingling, but nothing too bad. It was pretty easy to wash off and I definitely did notice a difference in my skin after the first use. My face looks brighter and clean after every use. My skin has pretty bad texture so I have been using the mask up to three times a week as recommended on the box. My nose area has improved the most so far. I don't think this would be good for people with sensitive skin it's on the strong side and the scent is strong so probably not good for people that don't like fragrance either.

Dealing with hormonal cystic acne and clogged pores, TATA HARPER's Resurfacing Mask has been a game-changer. This mask effectively targets both my oily skin and stubborn clogged pores, also known as sebaceous filaments. The gentle yet potent formula exfoliates and clarifies without causing irritation, leaving my skin smoother and more radiant. Despite struggling with acne, I've noticed a visible improvement in the texture and clarity of my complexion after using this mask. It's a must-have for anyone with oily, acne-prone skin looking for a solution to stubborn clogged pores."

It comes in a gorgeous glass jar with a gold lid that has a very luxurious feel and look to it, but you don't get alot of product for the price and I was totally expecting to see more which I find very disappointing. It has a peachy tinted gel-like texture that applies and spreads smoothly to my skin and a very distinctive rose geranium fragrance that is thankfully non-bothersome. It gently exfoliates my skin, removing dead skin cells while absorbing and controlling my excess oils without causing me irritation or breakouts. It leaves my skin smooth, fresh, and with a stunning radiant glow. It also makes my pores appear smaller and doesn't dry my skin out. I absolutely love how healthy and rejuvenated this mask leaves my complexion, but I do wish it came with a spatula and more product!"

This instant glow mask provides the most insane transformation of the skin I have ever experienced. When I first read the claims on the packaging I was skeptical at just what that would look like for me. I applied a thick layer of the mask to cleaned skin and left it on for 20 minutes. I then rinsed with warm water and the results this mask provided to my skin was nothing less than spectacular. I went to bed feeling absolutely radiant and woke up the next day even more impressed. I incorporated this mask into my routine twice a week and the results continue to show in my skins health! If you are looking for a mask to give you that renewed complexion definitely try this resurfacing mask."

I have noticed my skin is immediately glowy after using this mask. It does not have a strong scent to it, just a natural, earthy scent. I have also noticed a decrease in my blemish when using this mask, as it does have exfoliating properties. Overall, I throughly enjoyed this face mask & have seen impressive results with continued usage. My skin is healthier, glowier, and overall brighter.

Add in the challenges of middle age, and it's a double whammy for my skin. Thatu2019s why Iu2019m in love with Tata Harper skincare and so glad I discovered the Resurfacing Mask. As a skincare enthusiast, I appreciate that it is formulated with BHA from white willow bark and pomegranate enzymes, that turn over dead skin cells to give me more radiant looking skin. With each application it further delivers on its promise to refine pores, smooth and soften skin. The combination of ingredients like pomegranate enzymes, pink clay, lemongrass, beetroot extract, and barley breathes life back into my weather-beaten, dull skin while going to work to prevent blemishes from sweat and grime. My skincare routine now includes applying this glow-inducing mask every other day, immediately after my morning run. While I tend to chores around the house, it works its wonders for 20-30 minutes before I rinse it off in the shower. Afterwards, my complexion is revitalized- it gives my skin a youthful glow despite my age and the battle against sweat and the elements. I alternate using the Resurfacing Mask one day with Tata Harper's Water Lock Moisturizer the next, right after my daily run while my pores are still open from sweating. This duo is my new frontline defense against the toll running and age take on my skin. I highly recommend this mask for anyone who wants to achieve the youthful glow that healthy skin provides, and particularly for athletes who want to treat their skin after a grueling workout."

It goes on my face very smoothly and then dries clear later on which I can feel it tightens my skin. My skin also feels really soft and it provides a healthy glow to my dull skin. I am pretty happy with the results so far!  This mask has a herbal and rose combined scent to it as it made with 100% natural ingredients. The key ingredients are pomegranate, willow bark, enzymes and beet root extract. All these can help with refining pores, softening skin, improving dullness and enhancing skin textures. It is recommended to use together with Tata Harper Regenerating cleanser for better results.  Besides the little jar, I am 100% satisfied with this mask. I hope they can make a bigger size jar so my neck can enjoy some too."

It's gel like but not sticky. It glides on my skin like silk, and there isn't much scent. Like the clarifying cleanser, it has a nice cooling sensation when first applied. It's also vereasy to use and not time-consuming at all. I apply it to my face and neck, and over the next 20 minutes, it slowly dries. It's easy to remove with warm water or a disposable towel. Afterward, my skin feels hydrated and plump but also has a beautiful glow. I've been using Tatas' resurfacing mask three times a week for the past two weeks, and I can honestly say that I've noticed my skin texture is much more even.

My skin looks so refreshed after using this, so I always use it when my skin looks dull and congested. I love the ingredients like pomegranate enzymes that get rid of all the dead skin cells, but then the ingredients like beetroot extract and barley help smooth the skin. I feel like most products that have any kind of vitamin C or enzyme that exfoliates always set off my rosacea but I have never once had an issue with this product irritating my skin. I love to use this along with the regenerating cleanser for extra bright and dewy skin. Knowing it is all natural too, this product is tops on my list. Definitely add this to your skincare routine!"

Utilizing a small skin spatula (not included) makes it easy to take the mask out of its jar.  The standout ingredients, natural BHA from White Willow Bark Extract and Pomegranate Enzymes, gently exfoliates the skin without causing irritation. Resurfacing Mask has become a staple in my self-care routine and always makes my skin look amazing. After each use, my skin feels remarkably smooth and has a radiant glow.  Although it dries on the skin, the mask doesnu2019t feel tight at any point. Removal with just water is a little time consuming. I highly recommend using a damp washcloth rather than your hands to remove the mask after 20 minutes of use."

            "review_text": "As a beauty enthusiast and major skincare lover, I was super elated to try Tata Harper Resurfacing Mask which is a Resurfacing BHA Mask for brightening and refining pores. Tata Harper is an amazing natural luxury beauty/skincare brand! This resurfacing mask is a glow treatment that instantly restores radiance that helps with blocked pores, dull, or rough skin.  My first impression is that this resurfacing mask came in a really small jar (1 fl oz) with a hefty price tag for $68. The Tata Harper Resurfacing Mask has a nice peachy colored gel texture that smoothly applied to my skin then dried clear! It tingled a little bit and I could feel the mask firming my face and neck! It had a beautiful pleasant rose and herbal plant scent. This mask uses nourishing ingredients 100% from nature! It contains high performance botanical ingredients such as willow bark, pomegranate enzymes, and beet root extract! These high performance botanical ingredients help create an amazing rosy glow, refines pores, and soften skin texture!  After rinsing off the Tata Harper Resurfacing Mask, I noticed immediate positive results on my aging dull skin with dark spots! My skin felt and looked incredible soft, my skin was noticeably brighter, glowing, and my pores looked less visible! This mask definitely delivers instant results! It is recommended to also use the Tata Harper Resurfacing Mask in conjunction with the Tata Harper Regenerating cleanser.  I highly recommend the Tata Harper Resurfacing Mask if you are looking to revive your dull dry skin with an instant glow. However, the price tag is pretty hefty for such a small jar and you donu2019t get much for the price. It is still worth the price tag if you are able to afford this mask!"

The Tata Harper Resurfacing Mask packaging is really pretty and classy and looks good sitting on your countertop. The mask is very gel like an easy to apply and has a pleasant but hard to place smell to it. Itu2019s some thing you would expect to smell in a spa setting. As a medical aesthetician in a spa, a lot of our botanical products smell similar to this mask. my biggest negative about this product is itu2019s very small for a product. They recommend you use 2 to 3 times a week and its price point is $68. Itu2019s only 30 mL which is not very much at all maybe five or six masks worth which when you divide that out by the cost is a pretty expensive mask. I think honestly a lot of people would be turned off by the price of that when they see how big the mask actually is."

            "review_text": "I am a Beauty Enthusiast and lover of skincare. I love using high quality skin care products that provide visible results.  Recently I have been using the Resurfacing Mask by Tata Harper. And honestly it's not as amazing as I was hoping it would be. This mask comes in a very esthetic 1 fl oz/ 30 ml glass jar. Its priced at $68, definitely a luxury product with a high price tag that not all may be able to afford.   I like that this mask is easy to apply. It has a jelly like texture and once I started to apply it went on very smoothly on my skin. The jelly like texture feels very soothing and gives a cooling effect on my skin. The mask dries fairly quickly and forms a clear film like texture which is easy to wash off.  I also really liked the fragrance of this mask. It smells really beautiful. The combined smell of willow bark, rose, bergamot, lemongrass, and pomegranate all provide for a delightful experience.  Now as far as results are concerned I am a little disappointed. Because I did not notice a vast difference in my skin even after having finished the entire jar of this mask. Yes my skin felt clean after washing my face but honestly that can be accomplished with using any regular face mask. I was hoping that as promised this mask will transform dull complexion into vibrant, glowing one. However, I did not find this to be true in my case.  To conclude I would not recommend this mask to others because I feel this mask is very expensive for the amount of product that you will be get. As stated above the jar is only 1 oz and you will only be able to get 3-4 uses out of it before the container is empty. I don't consider this a must-have item rather a splurge item because in my opinion there are far better face mask in the market that provide instant results with half the price of this mask.  **This review was collected as part of a promotion."

The sample size was 3ml - just enough for a single use to cover my face and neck, whilst still leaving a small amount in the sachet to try out as a spot treatment. The mask is a gel-texture which has a peachy/pink tint and a distinctive Rose Geranium fragrance. Funnily enough it tingled within 3 minutes after applying, but only for a minute or so, after which I felt nothing at all. At just under 20 minutes I noticed it was starting to dry-out and lose adherence on certain areas of my face (chin and between eyebrows especially) and so I figured it was a good time to remove before it starts to flake off and create a mess! It does leave a slightly 'slimy' feel on the skin as you wash it off, and which took me a good few minutes to remove completely. So what did it achieve? Well unfortunately my pores were exactly the same as they were 20 minutes prior, whilst my skin on the other hand had a nice subtle glow to it. There was no other discernible difference, in texture, clarity etc. I did also use it on a couple of acne bumps overnight as a spot treatment. It helped, but the difference was not as pronounced as Paula's Choice 10% AHA or The Ordinary's Niacinamide. For me this was just an averagely good mask, although I much prefer Tata's Clarifying Mask over this.     ~ My Sephora Top 7 must-have list ~  (My top 7 must-have beauty products of all time, focusing mainly on my purchases at Sephora)  1.

It comes in a beautiful glass jar, goes on clear, dries down really tight however not painful. It's easy to wash off after 20 minutes. I don't see a ton of results so I don't think this will make it into my routine, but it is nice when I'm just looking to relax, but my skin isn't really in need of anything in particular."

I leave on for 20 minutes during which time it dries down and it is pretty easy to rinse off. Iu2019m left with softer skin that looks more radiant. I think this helps purge my skin when I need it because I felt a bump on my chin that hurt as if a large pimple was forming and after using this, the next morning it had a small white head which allowed the pimple to disappear faster.

I applied the rest of my routine (holi frog toner, peach and lily essence, yttp hyaluronic acid serum, and the Ameon moisturizer) and my skin this morning is so plump and bright!!! Itu2019s actually insane. I think itu2019s best to do a hydrating routine following the use of this mask. My only compliant is the size!!! I know that there is a demographic who can afford this but $65 for one fluid ounce is out of reach for most beauty lovers. I really enjoyed this mask but the size and price tag did dampen the experience."

Upon application the mask spreads easily, a thin layer is more than enough as a little goes a long way, it then starts  dries down with the feel of tightening which I believe is when it starts working on my pores exfoliating my skin.

The exfoliation level is defiantly gentle enough to use a few times a week and I look forward to glowing skin!"

I placed the mask on my forehead  nose and chin, where I had some dullness and uneven texture due to dry skin and acne, and waited 20 minutes.

I spend a lot on skincare but thought the price for this product was very high, considering the small quantity and the amount to be used each application. I went ahead and purchased it anyway. It was good for the first few uses. As I mentioned, I spend a lot on skincare and I have a lot of masks that I use in rotation. Hence I was using this on special occasions, necessary appointments, and not every week. However, in even just a short period of time, it became like a water pill. I saw no effectiveness of the product whatsoever. It just didn't do anything anymore. I tried applying more each time, but it was the same. I fathom that the natural ingredients Tata Harper uses lose their efficacy extremely quickly. I ended up finishing the product but only getting a few good uses out of it. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone who wants to use it past a couple to few months because of the issue I faced. I'm not sure if anyone else had this issue. I decided to give it a 3 star ranking because it did work effectively at the beginning, so the product is not lacking, but the preservation of it."

After washing off, yes, I notice a beautiful glow and my skin feels tighter and pores look smaller. I have lots of other products I'm using that help with glow, dullness and texture though (like other chemical and enzyme peels, AHA and vitamin C products, retinol) but for skin tightening and pores, nothing exciting. I also use a BHA serum from The Inkey List, which helps with blackheads but still, not noticing anything impressive for pores. What's the magic ingredient(s) in this? The pink clay, the willow bark? Could I find another product for cheaper, maybe probably, but I don't currently know what that is. Maybe I can score this on sale. Or maybe I need another sample to decide if it's worth it. But purchase this at $65 for only one ounce? Right now, I just can't. "

Every product is crafted with care & qualityu2014from the overall product itself, itu2019s ingredients to its packaging. And Tata Harperu2019s Resurfacing Mask is no different. Because they formulate, manufacture & package their products directly on their farm in Vermont you can tell that the quality is there in the product. I spread a thick layer of the mask on my face & it spreads like butter. It is so smooth & glides across my face like a dancer. It is a strong mask, so I want to give notice to those with sensitive skin types that it may be too strong for you to use or at least use on a more regular basis because of it being a BHA based mask. But for me it was perfect & clears away the debris of the week & gives me a clean canvas to work with. My pores look & feel smaller, my skin feels softer & more even & my face has a glow that wasnu2019t apparent before I used it.  It has helped other products work better because it gets rid of all the junk on my skin without irritating, damaging, or drying it out. In fact it feels like itu2019s more moisturized & glowy than ever.  Iu2019ve taken to using it 2-3 times a week to give me a spa like experience at homeu2014bc this product definitely screams luxury."

After letting it dry down you could tell there was something on the face but the feeling didnu2019t linger for long. I rinsed off after the stated 20 minutes and did notice a nice glow to the skin. The smell is the only thing that sort of bothered me. It isnu2019t horribly strong but I could get a citrusy fragrance out of it and it bothered me enough to cause me a headache after about 10 minutes of having it on.

It feels very refreshing when applying to the skin that I even think would make a very nice cool mask for the summer (especially if you put it in the fridge:)). It has a very clean and fresh scent which I like since scents on the face just seem to stick longer. When you apply, it applies smooth and when it starts drying, it gets a bit harder. It's easy to wash off with just some water and leaves you skin feeling soft and smooth. I have oily skin and it still left my skin very soft and refreshed however, I did not see any improvements in brightness at all so I would not buy this based off that. I think it's just a nice cooling mask. As far as exfoliation, it gives you a cleaner feel but I don't think it removed any dead skin since it's very gentle and jelly like. I would probably used this as a refreshing and cooling mask after having gone through other treatments. I do love that this product is marked as Clean Beauty but I would most likely not purchase this in the future. This was gifted by Tata Harper Skincare in exchange for my honest review."

This mask is for Resurfacing  your skin and bring smooth, fresh skin to the surface.  I'm not sure if I will be repurchasing because of my sensitive skin and didnt enjoy the bug repellent smell But I would recommend to anyone who doesn't have sensitive skin."

I feel that for the amount of product you get this is pricey. Yes, I know it's Tata Harper, but this will not last me a long time. If it was twice the size I'd have no problem recommending it. If you are in the market for a bougie mask and treating yourself, I would absolutely recommend this."

So far I haven't seen the long term results of it but the short term has definitely won me over. The application is like smooth cool jelly with a nice refreshing citrus scent. My skin felt clean and slightly tight and ever so slightly tingly after each use. It was a wonderful experience, my skin overall felt smoother and less oily. I have dry acne-prone skin for reference. I think the exfoliation is gentle enough for consistent usage so far I will be using it twice a week."

Once, applied to my face and neck I allowed the product to sit on my skin for about 20 minutes and it hardened onto my skin like a clay mask, but better. It was a easy and mess free process to rinse from my skin and it left my skin glowing and softer than before. I could tell that my skin was brighter and more radiant than before. It does gently exfoliate skin and is gentle enough to be used a few times a week. I definitely recommend this mask to others!"

I appreciate beautiful packaging, but we all know itu2019s the product inside that matters! This resurfacing mask is best for those with dull skin or have rough / textured skin. This mask contains BHAu2019s and enzymes to help renew the skin so you are left with more radiant and renewed skin! Iu2019ve used this mask three times and definitely notice a difference - especially with the current dry, cold winter air, my skin has been especially dull and rough from dryness.

The 2nd time I used it alone, and it worked fantastically! My skin felt so much smoother afterward, although I did experience some redness. It was not painful or itchy though, so no harm, no foul! It has a lightly citrus scent, in my opinion, and smooths onto the skin easily. I DO wish it had come with some sort of applicator, however. All in all, a GREAT product, but be aware it is fragranced, and does contain alcohol, so may not be the best thing for extremely sensitive skin."

My skin was not immediately smoother than before but was definitely brighter after using the mask for 20 minutes. It didnu2019t break me out either which is a plus! On the day after using the mask, I did notice my skin was slightly smoother but not a huge difference. It also helped mattify my skin which I loved.

It is easy to use, just apply a good amount of layer of this mask onto the skin with your fingertips, leave it on for at least 20 minutes and then rinse it off with lukewarm water. My skin is already glowing just after using it a few times. It feels softer, moisturized, and amazingly beautiful. I would recommend this to everyone to try it.   Itu2019s is packed with powerful ingredients like: White Willow Bark that cleanses and refines the pores. Pomegranate Enzymes that exfoliate and cleanse the skin.  Pink Clay that it pulls out the dirt including excess oil and pollutants which keeps the pores clogged. Beet Root Extract effectively moisturizes the skin.  All in all, I am very impressed with this mask. I am using it twice a week and so far I loved the results. It not only makes my skin smoother but it also improves my skin texture.

I guess i kind of expected it to sit in the skin, but no, she goes deep.. as it dried it got a bit tacky and almost made my face feel tightened in areas, nothing unpleasant or uncomfortable. It smells like roses, and for being an all natural product with no artificial fragrance, i was surprised at was how potent the smell was.. It smells good but it is very pungent, and personally I do prefer a lighter scent. Overall i was very pleased with the performance of this mask and although it pains me to say it, I could see spending the money for this. I do feel like I get similar results when I use my less expensive aha mask, but not in one use like this one. Definitely recommend if you want to glow to the high heavens and splurge a bit."

First off, I love the bright colors of the packaging and the bright scent directs my kind before I even try the actual product! Next, the jelly consistency covers my face with just a dab (a little bit goes a long way!). At first I thought it was going to absorb into my skin because it's clear but after a few minutes I could see and feel a smooth, thin layer over my skin! After about 10 minutes (half way through), I could feel my skin tingling, almost but not quite stinging. After washing it off, my face felt so light, cool, super smooth and it was definitely brighter!!! I definitely can't use this daily and even a few times per week may be too much. I will most likely use this once a week or for special occasions."

The hardest part for me to  review is the scent for any product, mostly because I do not find many products to have a welcoming scent (for me).  This has to be hands down the best smelling skincare product I have used to date.    To use: Apply a light layer of the 'jelly' mask on clean dry face.  Sit back and relax for 20 minutes.  The mask has a cooling effect.   Rinse off and pat face dry with clean dry towel.  My face feels amazingly soft and hydrated.  I still smell the scent lingering after for a bit of time, so I was happy!    This is noted to be gentle enough to use a few times a week.  Good for oily and combination skin and targets dullness, pores & uneven texture.    This is my first product i have tried from Tata Harper and am very happy so far.  I have a couple favorite skincare products I actually love to use.  A mask is one of them.  I truly enjoy the whole process of using it.

I had not even seen those injuries for years, and this made them look new.  I will go back to the products from other companies that use five or eight organic ingredients, since they make me look great and younger.  This company's approach does not work for me at all, like having 347 ingredients in the kitchen doesn't mean they would make a good stew all together.  Oh well--I wanted to love it but it isn't for me.

Furthermore, the texture is like minced jello or pectin jelly, so, if you do not like slimy textures please be aware (I was cool with it tho).   Pros: I really appreciate that this formula is easily build-able  and has the flexibility wear time of short term or long term (overnight).

Just like any other mask or cleanser you must use more than once to notice results. The first time using this product my face was very smooth and moisturized. After using for about three weeks i have noticed clearer skin with a slight dewy glow. I like a lot of Tata Harper's products, because of the natural ingredients."

For someone like me that is used to stronger masks, I recommend The Ordinary AHA 30% + BHA 2% Peeling Solution Mask. Itu2019s way less expensive, and you see instant, glowing results."

I also have never used any BHA or AHA products in my life so I was a little nervous to try, having sensitive skin and all. The directions actually werenu2019t on the jar, itu2019s a tiny 7.5 mL jar, I had to look them up and it said to leave on for 20 minutes and apply a generous amount. Very unfortunate, that there was only enough in the jar for 1 use. Spreading it thinly even only left me with a tiny bit smudged at the bottom of the jar. I used this after cleansing my skin with my Raeka tumeric facial scrub. It was a little hard to apply to my skin because it has like a jello consistency lol so sometimes it slides off my face if I donu2019t rub it in immediately. There was no burning feeling but a slight tingling sensation during the first few minutes. I could feel my pores start to breath while wearing the mask. Rinsing it off was very easy and quick which I enjoyed! After removal, I was surprised to see that my face was not inflamed, dry or burning. It was a welcome surprised. I either apply my usual moisturizer or a hydrating sweet chef kale facial mask but I donu2019t feel that I need to after using the mask. Thatu2019s just what I like to do when doing a facial. I definitely notice right off the bat after removing the mask that my pores have been cleaned. It makes my acne scars disappear, evens my skin tone, adds a glow to my skin, hydrates my skin and heals any acne that was there to start with. It also keeps me acne free while I use it!!! I definitely suggest this mask since it is made of the best ingredients for your skin AND it worked for my sensitive skin, so it should work for anybodyu2019s!!!!"

Iu2019m sure results would be amazing with regular use and if the price was lower to be able to test that theory, Iu2019d probably give it 5 stars.  Iu2019ve repurchased the 1 oz full size jar a few times after first receiving a sample. I just caved and bought the limited addition 3.33 oz jar and if you can splurge, do it. The brush alone is worth it. Before I was using a MAC flat shader foundation brush, as I do to apply all my fake masks. But the Tata Brush that comes in the set picks up the PERFECT amount of product so you can apply a thin, even layer. Any other brush you use will require you to u2018scoopu2019 up a glob to apply a thick layer, which we probably all like because we feel like more product means better results. But in this case, itu2019s not needed, and the Tata brush will help to make this huge limited edition size jar last even longer.

It doesnu2019t irritate my sometimes sensitive skin with two to three times weekly use. Iu2019m trying to decide if itu2019s worth the price tag for the jumbo size during the VIB sale (with 15% off, it comes out to ~$36 per oz, which is the size of the regular size mask that costs $65 regularly). The product is awesome, but the price tag definitely makes me pause before purchasing."

For reference, I have normal/dry skin with minor aging concerns. Although I find physical exfoliants to be most effective for my skin, I do like to augment that with things like masks and peels.  I have to say, this Resurfacing Mask just didn't wow me like the serum did. This is a decent mask; it smells good and left my skin feeling softer than before I applied it. I do like Tata Harper's commitment to producing natural, clean products, and I liked her other products so much I think that I was just left underwhelmed by this. To me, this is comparable to a great many resurfacing masks that are on the market in both specialty retailers and drugstores. No better, and no worse. But for this price...I want something that is holy grail status. There is absolutely nothing that sets this mask apart in my mind, especially when I can go get a tube of Alba Botanicals enzyme peel for a fraction of the price with the same results. I would recommend to only the most die-hard Tata Harper brand loyalists."

I have been trying to get breakouts under control and I thought starting with pores in my t-zone would be the best and this mask works. Even if I don't use the cleanser as often as I would like, it still works wonders. I rarely need to use pore strips anymore and when I do, the extractions are tiny. The only complaint I might have is that it is a 30 minute mask vs 10-15 minutes."

I was waiting for the infamous glow from this product to emerge and it just didn't.

I did this every night for a week and completely got read of the infection. Of course, since the mask contains acids, youu2019ll get dry skin, you are basically burning skin with acid, and youu2019ll have to take extra care of it, it might not work for you if you have super sensitive skin but it literally saved me!

I was worried that the DE and Kate Somerville resurfacing products would be too harsh for me, so I decided to give Tata Harper a try, since it's all-natural. I am so impressed with the results. The mask definitely exfoliates without leaving my skin red and angry. It takes some practice to get the thickness right - I usually slather it all over and then build up the product in areas that need extra help. I would definitely use a brush for application, because I found it difficult to grab the product with my finger. The smell is also lovely without being overpowering!"

I wish it wasn't true, I do not have money to spend, but after sampling some of these products I decided to stop trying low cost skincare and just stick to a few basic products; this is one of them along with the Resurfacing Serum.   My skin normal with the exception of the area right around my nose, here I have rosacea. You know, the normal place it shows up, inner cheek area?  I can't use any BHA, just inflames my skin in this area. I apply this all over the face except right on my rosacea and the result is truly unbelievable.  I can't believe this is my skin, it is so smooth!  I do have melasma spots and there are still there, but after foundation my skin is almost flawless which is not the norm for me.   Sorry this is such a long review, but there is so much to say about this mask.  It's what I hoped to find in so many products that never delivered.

Fast forward to two weeks ago. I was at Sephora and it was being promoted with their boutique brands or emerging beauty brands or something like that. My face (combination skin) was feeling congested and based on the description (and, not gonna lie, scent) I decided to try it out. I began using as directed several times a week and noticed a change in my skin within the first week. It was smoother, seemed more even and the few small bumps I had on my face disappeared. I am in love. I use another brand of serum and night transformation gel and the three seem to work beautifully together... though based on my experience with the Tata Harper resurfacing mask, I'll definitely be trying more of this brand's products.

(Did I bury the lead there?) I use this mask every week. The more regularly you use it, the better the results. I actually adore almost everything I have tried from Tata Harper. Their products are completely luxurious feeling, do what they promise, and are 100% natural with no questionable chemicals. To say Iu2019m a big fan would be an understatement."

I'm not impressed with this and it will be regifted or swapped to someone else."

I donu2019t have a single blemish currently, which is amazing for my sensitive and slightly acne prone skin.

The dullness was gone and my skin was so smooth and bright. I'm back to buy a full size. I don't usually bother with masks as the ones I've tried before are uncomfortable while they're on and a pain to remove completely. This one is very light and comfortable and wiped off easily. Plus didn't cause any problems for my sensitive skin."

But you serious do not need a lot! So not only does it feel amazing on your skin, but I have VERY sensitive skin and it does not irritate it whatsoever. I havenu2019t had a product I was this happy with in a while. There were dramatic results for me overnight! A little story about my sensitive skin for you - this past weekend my mom got a new laundry detergent and when she hugged me I could tell it was different. That very day my face started breaking out. I had about 20 teeny tiny zits on my cheeks. Made my cheeks extremely red. I got the kit on Monday, by the way, Monday morning I woke up and my face was so red it looked like I just put blush all over my cheeks. So that night I got home from work, washed my face, put the mast on, cleaned it off then used the moisturizer. Tuesday - Not only did I only have THREE zits but ALL the redness was gone. This has been like a miracle kit for my sensitive skin! It feels great, it doesnu2019t burn, and the mask doesnu2019t get so hard it hurts your face. I definitely recommend this to someone with highly sensitive skin. I donu2019t know if itu2019s supposed to help with breakouts too but it definitely worked for that too!"

The first day I used it, I came home from work and removed my makeup as usual, washed my face with warm water and cleanser and applied a bit of the product all over my face. I know the box suggests it be left on for 15 - 30 mins but I kept it on a whole hour. It was great because it's colorless and drys very fast. I then went in the shower and let my face steam a bit before washing it off. Later, I toned and moisturized my face and I could already feel the difference. I then applied the mask every single day for the rest of the week. My skin has changed. It feels amazing now. No clogged feeling, nothing. just smooth and soft. Now I use the mask once or twice a week. the frequency depends on how my skin is feeling. I love using it when my hormones are off balance, helps keep the oiliness under control and prevents any hormonal breakouts. Try it if you haven't already! It's well worth the price."

A sunspot is gone, and my skin is so smooth and radiant my husband does not believe it came from a jar. He's a former USMC officer and is going to try it himself!

BUT DAB IT IN SCARS & PITTING AND THE MIRACLE HAPPENS! I am 47 years old and have used more skin products than I can shake a stick at. I am not easily impressed, but this resurfacing mask has knocked me out. I got it free in my Sephora play box. I bought a full size before I even finished the trial.  I AM NOT RICH! I AM BROKE! THIS IS WORTH IT!!  JUST DAB A LITTLE AND LEAVE ON OVERNIGHT. IT WILL LAST YOU FOREVER!   I did not try it out initially because I already use Erno Laszlo double cleanse (deep cleanse black bar...that is awesome, too) and a Japanese peeling mask (the kind you put on and rub immediately and produces eraser-like particles.) I was very happy with how my skin was progressing to absolute smoothness. I must add that I am Black, so my aging process is significantly slower and I do not have any wrinkles. That being said, I do have issues with very oily skin and large pores. Not much in the way of regular acne, however I do have some texture issues.  I followed the advice of a previous reviewer and dabbed the product on some acne pitting and a weird keloid scar, my skin has a tendency to react poorly to damage. The first day, after leaving it on all night, was surprising. I thought I saw some changes, but thought perhaps I was just trying to see things. I tried it again the next night. The following morning I saw that the scarring was going away. I still thought I was crazyu2026 Until the third night.....  I AM NOT CRAZY! THE SCARS AND PITS ARE GOING AWAY. I asked others if they were seeing the same thing and they agreed. I am on night number 7 and still using the trial size and dabbing in a little bit on with a Q-tip. I expect my scoring to be gone in another couple of days. I plan to continue using the mask on an occasional basis and this will justify the high price.  As it says in the title, my mama don't lie and she sees a difference. So do I and this stuff works!"

It got so bad I seriously googled the words skin transplant. I had a sample of this sitting on my makeup table for months and then finally got around to trying it. I was surprised by the texture when I first opened it, a very slippery watery jelly. I love the scent and am very glad that it's not perfumed, it's real plant smells. I left the mask on for the whole 30 minutes. My face did get super tight while the mask was on, but it felt nice like it was actually working. When time was up, I swiped the back of my hand over my forehead and I actually gasped. The gross scabby texture on my forehead was gone! I washed it off as fast as I could and immediately noticed that my skin was really glowing. I used 2 Sunday Riley oils after and when I woke up in the morning about 1/4 of the acne on my forehead was gone and the deep purple cysts on my cheeks looked so much lighter. I ran to the store the very next day to get a full sized tub! I've been using exactly as recommended - 3 days in a row and then 1-2x a week from then on. So in total I've used this probably 7 times and my skin has dramatically changed. The forehead acne is 1/2 gone and I only have 2 smaller cheek cysts remaining! Plus, all my old scarring is so much lighter. I am so happy to have found this product and will continue to use until all of my acne has disappeared!"

I've always been a fan of makeup and as someone who works in the beauty industry I eventually branched out into exploring the world of skincare. I'm at that super sweet spot where I still get pimples but am now worried about crow's feet, plus I have a bum thyroid which makes my skin suuuuper dry. This can make it challenging to find products that cover all my bases! That being said, I received this in my Birchbox and immediately loved it. The scent is lovely, and the little sample I got lasted 3 uses. It makes my skin look AMAZING, no exaggeration. Bright and clear and even-toned skin is what I wake up to the morning after using this magic goop. I just had to repurchase some of my Sunday Riley products so I'm going to wait a minute to buy this in the full size, but I can hardly wait! Literally saved the tiniest bit to put on the night before an event I have this week... it's that good. (Also it smells fantastic)"

While removing the product I noticed my skin felt very smooth, so I didn't think much of it as my skin looked about the same. For the next 7 days my skin looked so luminous and bright. I had so many compliments on my skin looking great but all I had done differently was this mask. Give this one a try it's clearly does what it says. Your skin feels soft, looks smooth, and gives a glowy look without makeup. Btw the more even a layer of this stuff is on your skin the better it works."

I also happen to be blessed with very sensitive skin which severely limits the products I can use. I received a sample of this with some Sephora purchase and decided to give it a go. I can't recall where specifically, but I remember reading online about someone saying it helped with their acne, so I decided to try it.   When I used it as a mask and left it on for only a few minutes, I saw minimal results. However, somewhere along the way I decided to see what happened if I left a light coating on just my problem area chin for an entire night. I woke up and my acne and scarring was visibly better. I kept doing it, thinking I would soon enough see some evidence of sensitivity or other negative effects but to my surprise, my skin only continued to improve. I now put a very small amount on my chin (and sometimes my nose in the hopes of reducing pore size) every night, and to be honest, my skin has never looked better. Needless to say, this product has become a must-purchase for me."

It does add radiance but there are other methods to getting that look that aren't as expensive. I have very clear skin, so I can't say how it would work for those with skin issues.

I had tried a Tata Harper face oil before and hated it and assumed I would hate this as well but got it as a free sample.  Didn't notice much the night I put it on and took it off but the next day my skin looked brighter.  The day after that my redness and skin bumps were almost non existent!!!  I am out of town now and left the sample home but will be tackling it and muttering about it being my preciousssss once I am home.  I ordered the full size and am actually hopeful for my skin for the first time since this horrid skin issue reared its head.   My skin also feels much smoother, like porcelain.  Putting makeup on made me look ten years younger (I'm 37) and I didn't even have to use concealer on what are normally terrible hereditary dark circles under my eyes.  I would spend $500 on these sorts of results!  I didn't have to use much either.  I could probably get five or six more uses out of just the sample."

Felt an initial tingling when I first applied it to my face but this sensation subsided fairly quickly and did not happen again throughout masking. Mask sets and dries pretty quickly, maybe I did not apply enough product but it's so thin and peachy in colour that after applying it doesn't actually look like anything is on your face. I let it sit for 12 minutes and decided that that was long enough for my first application (as it indicates 10 mins is sufficient for sensitive skin), thinking I might try 20 next time and see if that creates a more dramatic effect?  Outcome of first experience: pores appear to have reduced, somewhat. Face seems maybeee mildly more glowy but nothing to rave about."

It did irritate and burn my skin and turn it red (only the second time), but the results were amazing. (Note: I do not have sensitive skin.)  I always have these dry, flakey, textured, porous patches on the sides of my nose. I could never seem to get rid of them no matter how much I tried with granular exfoliants and enzyme powders. However, this mask completely eliminated those rough patches, and it is the only thing I've found thus far that does. When I was applying concealer around my nose afterward, it went on soo smoothly and looked flawless. Putting foundation on was like painting a ceramic figurine, my skin was so refined. It's like the mask really eats away the tiniest of dead skin particles and refines every pore.  If you don't have super sensitive skin and can withstand this mask for 20 minutes, it is definitely worth it."

I received a sample of this Tuesday night, well last night (Thursday) I decided to try it out. I did not read about it prior to using it, I did not want a bias. I have never even heard of Tata Harper until I put this on my face. This morning I woke up and for the first time in a long time my skin was basically evenly toned all over, NO RED. INSANE. I usually always carry red on my cheeks..so to not have even the faintest amount WOW. My skin also looked rejuvenated and had a beautiful glow. I have basically been ranting and raving about this product all day to anyone who will listen. I cannot go wait to buy the full size..I am also tempted to try the rest of the line, it seems like a really stand up company with amazing ingredients!  If you haven't tried this..DO IT, yesterday."

My skin is somewhat sensitive, and will usually be a bit delicate or even red following a new mask, but this wasn't the case here at all. It's a pink-tinged jellylike texture that feels a bit like smoothing grape jelly over one's face. I leave it on for about 25-30 minutes, it dries transparent and only mildly tightens as it dries (not uncomfortable at all; if you make to effort to talk a little bit around the 5-10 min mark, you won't feel like you're breaking the seal when/if you suddenly get chatty 20 minutes in). I then wash it off with warm water and some mild massaging (this takes a few moments actually, to remove it fully from the face and neck). After patting dry, my skin feels very fresh, definitely like it's been exfoliated but not at all sensitive or raw from the experience (even following it with an exfoliating toner or serum doesn't feel like overkill). I'd almost even describe it as matte looking/feeling, but you still definitely get a little glow going on afterwards. I realize that saying something gives you a matte glow seems totally contradictory, but just trust me and go with it. I'd definitely recommend it to almost anyone, people both new and experienced with chemical exfoliation. It's gentle but very effective. I'm slowly falling in love with Tata Harper's entire line, the products I've tried so far are super solid, but this is definitely their star product."

I'm currently battling hormonal acne, which means a lot of bumps either new or old that I'm trying to heel. After one application I have noticed a decrease in size of these bumps- PRAISE!

I was getting twice a week facials, stopped wearing makeup for a bit, but nothing really got rid of the bumpy texture and erratic dryness/ breakouts. Enter this knight in shining armor. First use, skin is calmer, more clear, bumps reduced, pores smaller. By week 2 (using 3x/ week), the bumps were almost totally gone. 1 month in and I'm back to people stopping me on the street to ask what products I use. I *glow*. No pores, no bumps, no melting makeup, no red or dry spots, no weird afternoon oil slick. I feel like the amount of product and benefit you get for the price makes this mask the best bang for your buck in Tata's line. I have no idea what the directions say (I'm far too impatient and arrogant to read those things), so here's what I do: after exercise/ work out I wipe down the the hydrating essence, slather on a generous layer, step into the shower and do my hair/ body thing with the mask on for about 10 mins. Rinse. Cleanse. Done. You're welcome! Just kidding, but I swear by this stuff, and it's become as much a part of my life as a proper deodorant and toothpaste."

I definitely notice smoother and firmer skin after applying the mask for about twenty minutes.

I usually apply it on Monday mornings (I work from home) to repair skin after a weekend of drinking and staying out late. I've even applied this mask on a flight returning from my honeymoon in Thailand, so I wouldn't look exhausted when I returned!

After using this mask, your face feels very clean, smooth, clear, and super fresh. A little but also goes a very very long way. I've used it a couple times and every time I open the container, it still looks like I've never used it.

I only get a handful of uses out of one jar- maybe enough for 5 or 6 applications.  The consistency is very different from most masks I've used in the past. It is goopy and gel-like. You can feel the gel hardening and drying on your face, which eliminates pores and tightens skin big time! I leave this on for about 30 minutes and my face feels fresh and revitalized afterwards.  I would recommend this for use in summer rather than winter, because, if you're like me, your skin tends to be a little more sensitive/dry in the winter. On sensitive skin, this mask can feel a little harsh. A mild burning discomfort. It can leave my face quite red and irritated after rinsing it off."

One of my samples broke while in transit bc of the below zero temps so I called to request another and they promptly overnighted a very, very generous sample size! This mask is super lightweight and translucent. I expected it to be drying on my sensitive fair skin but it was very gentle and left my skin soft and with a brightness that I didn't have 30 mins before. My husband even noticed!

I felt like it was comfortable on my skin, though it does have witch hazel in it which made my eyes feel a bit watery for a minute or two.  It definitely temporarily tightens the skin (probably again due to the witch hazel) but nothing is going to actually shrink pores. It may temporarily make them appear smaller, which is as good as it gets. But in terms of realism in cosmetic treatments, that's important to note. That said, it does a good job at temporarily tightening the surface of the skin and making it look even and radiant.  Sometimes with masks, I can get a bit red or pink after, but this one just left my skin very glowing and moisturized.  Bottom line: I'd definitely recommend this, despite the somewhat prohibitive cost. If you're realistic about the short term effects vs anything permanent or long lasting, then I think you'll likely benefit and enjoy using it."

Not just out of what I've tried from the line but out of every product I've ever tried. It does exactly what it says: my complexion really looks refreshed (even when I'm beyond tired) and positively glows after using this mask. It's an exfoliant and treatment mask in one so no need for that extra step of a physical or enzymatic scrub before applying the Resurfacing Mask. I just do a once over with my cleanser to wash my makeup, sunscreen, etc. off my face, pat dry and then apply this directly. Easy and fuss free. It has the faintest of calming scents, slightly green and sweet (honeysuckle?) but the scent is so mild it wouldn't offend anyone sensitive to smell (like me). The consistency is, as one reviewer called it, a bit 'soapy' like a watery gelatin so it is easy to apply too much. You really only need a light coating across the face. Inevitably, you'll reach in and pull out globs so keep in mind that you'll most likely need less than you anticipate. Rather than filling my palm, I spread it on my face bit by bit so none of this precious mask goes to waste. It's excellent value too. The jar may look small but you only need a little each time. It's a very pretty pink color, like a gemstone, but fear not, your face will not look pink either during or after. The gelatinous texture has the added benefit of defusing the color as it's thinned out and spread across the face. It tightens on the skin as it dries but never stings, itches or is in any way uncomfortable. It washes off easily with a bit of water and cleanser and the result is instant luminosity. My skin literally glows after I use this mask, which I love. It also makes the texture of my skin noticeably smoother to the touch and any product that I use after seems to have a more pronounced effect. TIP: Because this is so effective at removing any material clogging the skin's surface, it's the perfect product to use once or twice a week before applying a serum that promises action packed results. I save my most complex (and delicate) serums for nights that I pre-treat with this mask. Just be careful not to use anything that might irritate your skin after the Resurfacing Mask (like AHAs or retinol) if you are sensitive. I love that the ingredients of this product are all natural and I don't need to worry about what any chemical nasties may do to my body over time. I also love that Tata Harper has thoughtfully packaged this in glass that is both environmentally friendly (reuse or recycle it!) and sturdy enough to withstand traveling and the occasional tumble from counter to bathroom floor. This is a wonderful product, a winner all around, and I couldn't recommend it highly enough!"
