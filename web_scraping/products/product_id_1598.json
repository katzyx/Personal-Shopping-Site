It’s made with natural BHAs from white willow bark and pomegranate enzymes that gently exfoliate your skin, leaving it smoother and more radiant. The jelly-like texture goes on easily, and after 15-20 minutes, my skin looks noticeably brighter and refreshed. You can use this few times a week but It’s perfect when you need an instant glow like before a big event or when your skin just feels dull. I love that it works so well without any harsh chemicals. It’s definitely a splurge, but totally worth it for a weekly glow boost!"

It this lightweight gel mask that moisturizer your skin so nicely but makes you feel like you don’t have any mask on your face. I have to put the timer to remind myself to remove it but I wish I could keep it overnight. It smells amazing, super luxurious feeling. It is not sticky at all and not heavy whatsoever. I wish I could use when I prep my skin for my make up because I feel it leaves my skin extremely moisturized from within. The container is small but you only need a little bit. In the beginning I use a lot because couldn’t feel it on my skin. I definitely recommend it to be used a couple of times per week. Your skin will feel more glowy and nurture. Your make up will look flawless!"

It’s everything you’d expect from Tata Harper—luxurious, effective, and packed with clean, natural ingredients. This mask is like a spa treatment in a jar. After just 15–20 minutes, my skin looks visibly brighter, smoother, and more refreshed. After using for a few weeks, my skin is way less red! It's my go-to before special events or anytime I want an extra boost of radiance. The combination of enzymes and BHA resurfaces the skin without irritation. My pores look smaller, and my skin feels softer and more even after each use.  The gel-like texture spreads easily, so you only need a thin layer. Despite the higher price point, the jar lasts a long time, making it a worthwhile investment. The Tata Harper Resurfacing Mask is a luxurious addition to any skincare routine, delivering professional-quality results from the comfort of home. Whether you’re dealing with dullness, uneven texture, or just want a radiant boost, this mask works wonders. It’s worth every penny for the healthy, glowing skin it delivers. Highly recommend!"

			"review_text": "I am in my thirties and have combination skin that means oily. I look for products that may moisturize and at the same time help my oily T zone. This small but mighty face mask by Tata Harper is very effective at accomplishing both things. The mask has a gellish texture and a little goes a long way. I applied it with my fingers all over my face and my neck. As time went by, the mask started to dry into a shiny and tight veil. I waited twenty minutes for it to fully dry. I was amazed at how clear and soft my skin felt and looked after rinsing it out with warm water. I used it once or twice a week with great alike results. I think it makes a great addition to a routine for a home spa experience. I have seen my skin less congested and even made some scarring heal quicker. My only con is the price for the size of the jar."

			"review_text": "After using this mask the past two weeks, I have really noticed an increase in the plumpness and evenness of my skin. My dark spots have definitely faded and in effect, my whole face looks so much more glowy. Especially in the morning, I feel my skin is usually dull and any dark spots are very noticeable. 20 minutes of this mask every few days has made such a difference! The only reason I’m giving this 4 instead of 5 stars is because I did notice some mild irritation on my neck, however that is normal for me this time of year, as my dry skin gets exacerbated by the cold and dry weather and in turn becomes very sensitive. The smell of the mask is incredible and the gelatinous texture felt so cooling and relaxing! It truly felt like a facial in a jar and I will be recommending this to all of my friends. It feels very powerful if that makes sense… I actually feel like it’s doing its job while it’s sitting on my skin which I love."

			"review_text": "I have been using the Tata Harper Resurfacing Mask once a week for two weeks as part of a broader Tata Harper nighttime routine. Already I am noticing a positive improvement in my skin’s texture and pigmentation.  You can see the diffusion of the hyperpigmentation at the top of my forehead in the before and after pics and my flaky cheeks are almost 100% smooth!  The Resurfacing Mask can be used up to 3 times per week, which speaks to the gentle, skin-friendly nature of the product. The texture in the jar is bouncy, kind of like gelatin, but it spreads easily and melts right onto the skin during application. The mask dries evenly and gradually creates a feeling of tightening/toning. The scent is earthy with a cooling note and rinses cleanly with warm water.   I love that this mask uses natural and certified organic ingredients, the oil and minerals and sustainably and ethically sourced, and even the packaging is planet friendly.  Tata Harper has really created a skincare dream team with their lineup of products."

I have to set a timer to rinse it off since I kept forgetting. This mask is so different compared to many I've used before. To me, it's more like a gel moisturizer, very light, hydrating & soaking into my skin, and I feel like I have nothing on my face. My skin feels so nice after rinsing, it's cool to touch & feel plumped. Can't help but keep touching my face. My skin tone looks better and brighter.

Enter the Tata Harper Resurfacing Mask! This stuff is literally a spa in a jar! I’ve always heard amazing things about this brand and now I know why. After just one use, my pores were deeply cleansed of all their gunk and appeared smaller and my skin was smooth and glowing. It’s like having a mini facial at home. I slather on a layer and enjoy some tv for 20 minutes and after I rinse it off I have brand new glowing skin! As someone with a full time job who is always on the go, I appreciate that I can completely revamp my skin in only 20 minutes. While this gives great results, it’s still gentle on the skin unlike other masks that make similar claims. While this is on the pricey side, it’s a great investment for your skin and I highly recommend it."

			"review_text": "I recently tried the Tata Harper Resurfacing BHA Mask for Brightening and Dark Spots and have used this so much to reduce my acne scars. As someone who suffers from hormonal acne, I tend to break out a lot by my chin, resulting in acne scarring afterwards. I implemented this Tata Harper resurfacing mask and the BHA truly was a chemical exfoliant that cleared my pores and cleared my skin. I have dry skin, especially in the winter months so I'm fairly cautious as to what I use for my acne treatments but I did not have any irritation after using this product. The mask has a thick clay like texture which is great to absorb all the excess oils on your skin. I enjoy using this at night once a week as I have the most buildup on my face at the end of the day."

After rinsing the product off my face look like I drink a gallon of water everyday! My skin was so glowy and hydrated even without moisturizer. The only downside to the product is that it doesn't come in a bigger size lol. I use it at least twice a week but you really don't need much to cover your whole face."

I used this mask after cleansing my face. It’s really easy to apply and rinses clean. It has a nice clean smell and leaves a nice fresh feeling.   The results are amazing. My pores are less noticeable. It makes them look like they have shrunk. The texture of my skin is smoother.   My skin feels really soft after using. It makes my foundation makeup apply easier and look much better. Before, my skin even with foundation, looked textured.   Pros: Softer skin, pores less noticeable, smoother appearance and texture, gentle   Cons: wouldn’t advice using everyday   Overall, this is a great addition to my skincare routine."

I will continue to use it for ongoing results, especially with my dark spots, which you can see more now that the weather is colder and I am not as tan. It is not a huge jar but a little goes a long way. I like that you can feel the product tighten and peel a bit before rinsing it off. I used their daily cleanser and scrub to take it off but I didn't have any issues with burning or redness from the mask. The packaging is lux and it has a nice scent to it; just note it is glass and a bit heavy so don't drop it. My skin is normally oily and can get some congestion around my chin and nose, and this mask helped with both. I also didn't strip my skin or dry my face out after using."

This mask was perfect for my super oily skin as it left it glowing but clean and not greasy at all. The texture of the mask was different from my other masks as it was a jelly like consistency. You only need a small dab so the jar will last quite a bit of time. I put this on for 15 minutes or so and then dry it off and my skin feels porcelain and so smooth. This is perfect for oily skin people who want a silky smooth skin texture. The exfoliating pomegranate beads were also a nice touch to get rid of impurities while the clay is also great to really clean out those clogged pores. Overall this is a wonderful addition to my skin care routine!"

The consistency of this mask was a little different (my best comparison is jell-o like). I scooped a little out of the jar and then applied to my face. You really don’t need a ton of product (a little goes a long way) and it spreads really well onto the skin. I set a timer for 20 minutes and then rinse it off with warm water. There is a pleasant natural earthy citrus scent to this product.

It’s really easy to remove and doesn’t get stuck in your eyebrows, or leave little sneaky patches of mask like almost everyone I own, lol.   I applied it and left it on per instructions, and didn’t feel anything. I was expecting to feel some tingling or something given its name and promise. It was very soothing and calming- I would recommend it for that. The mask has Arnica, Rose Otto, and Calendula in it which are all super soothing. My skin was already looking pretty glowy from the Regenerating cleanser I’ve been using as well, so maybe it just has a very subtle effect in general, and didn’t do much for me. I think my before and afters reflect the regenerating cleanser the most, but no doubt that my skin looks brighter after using both."

This mask is also available intended to be used to boost dull and textured skin into even and glowing skin but I honestly don’t know if it did anything for me. I use to have dull skin but now it’s not as dull but my red spots have come out in full force. Like before I would wash my face and it would look tamed but now I feel like it’s showing my redness more and I’m not fond of that.

This is also excellent in combination with the Resurfacing Cleanser from Tata Harper. I think when combined, those two products will provide new life to your skin. Another thing I appreciated about this product was the quality packaging. It genuinely felt so luxurious and made me feel excited to use this mask.

I also like I don’t have to keep it on too long(20 minutes) and only need to apply it 3 days a week. After using the masks for a period of time, I have noticed my complexion suddenly change where it just glows consistently.  Having this glow makes me feel more confident, and I can take on any challenge head on during the day.  Additionally my face feels really stretchy, smooth, and cool after I rinse my face.  I also like that the product is certified vegan and is cruelty free.  With me being an animal lover and a vegan-in-progress, I find this commendable and want to support Tata Harper as much as I can.  Lastly, the smell has that coolness effect and is not too strong or too weak.  It is a very pleasant smell that I can continuously smell hours on end.  I recommend this product to anyone that wants glowing skin and feel great about themselves."

The gel-like texture feels lightweight and refreshing, and it applies smoothly without any mess. It’s like a jelly, or rather, a bouncy texture. It’s pretty cool! I’ve been using it twice a week, and every time I rinse it off, my skin feels incredibly smooth, soft, and has a subtle glow. It doesn’t make me look oily, and it doesn’t feel greasy.  It gently exfoliates without irritation, even on my combination skin. In the winter, my cheeks get dry, so my makeup doesn’t sit well, and I just look blah. I especially love how it clears away dullness and gives my face a subtle, natural glow. On days when my skin feels congested, it helps to refine my pores and calm any redness, making it a great multit asking mask. I’ve even used it before special events, and it leaves my skin prepped and radiant, making makeup go on flawlessly."

My skin drunk all the goodness up. It did not dry out my skin at all. The mask was easy to spread on the skin. I wish that it came with a little spoon to scoop the mask out of the jar or even one of those push mechanism where your fingers are not in the product at all.

It’s especially effective before special events or when your skin needs a quick pick-me-up.

On my dry and sensitive skin, I have to be strategic on the use of this mask. What I did at first is use it 3 consecutive nights as a part of a routine after the Regenerating Cleanser and found that to be a bit much for my skin type. At first, I knew I was purging. But knowing that some skincare products could do that I switched to every other day but still ended up only using it 2x a week. I found this to be the most effective for me. It worked well with micro peel that is not visible unless you look very very closely. I know that it aided in removing and exfoliating my dead skin cells. It might come in a small jar but with the amount that you need and the number of times you would need to use this is making it worth it. If you consider cost per use and its effects it is definitely worth the splurge. I would suggest to be more conservative in the usage of this because its effectivity did not rely on how many times I have used it but with the correct amount needed that my skin type will be able to handle."

This Tata resurfacing mask not only provides my skin with a glow, but it also makes my skin feel smoother. It contains BHA from white willow bark extract, which is a good exfoliation. It also contains pomegranate enzymes to help remove dead skin and pink clay to help with absorbing oil. Though my skin has been leaning more on the dry size, I still have a very oily tzone, so I like to concentrate it more on this section. As for my other areas, I still use the mask, just not as long. The smell of the mask I actually didn't quite like. However, I know it's a natural formula, and it doesn't linger on the skin, so I put up with it since it's only temporary. It has a gel texture as well, and i do not need a lot of products, which means this will last quite a while for me. For me personally, I reach for this one to twice every 2 weeks due to the medication I am on being very strong. When I do use it, however, I do like the effects it gives me. I do recommend this product if you are looking for glowy smooth skin."

The jelly-like texture feels incredibly silky as it glides onto the skin, and it absorbs quickly without any sticky residue.

The best part is rinsing it off—just add a little water and massage it into your skin, and it transforms into a silky texture that feels luxurious. Once it’s fully washed off, my skin feels unbelievably smooth, soft, and glowing. It’s like hitting the reset button for my face!  This mask is especially amazing during the winter when my skin becomes extra dry and dull. It brings my skin back to life, leaving it brighter, more even-toned, and incredibly refreshed.  Although the jar is only 30ml, you don’t need much. Just a small dab covers your entire face, so it lasts longer than you’d expect.

Tata Harper uses natural ingredients with a focus on being gentle to even the most sensitive skin. I got to try another of the Tata Harper masks, this time it was the resurfacing mask. This is labeled as a glow treatment mask with BHA and Pomegranate enzyme. I love this combo as it will be exfoliating but gentle and willow bark will help control any active breakouts. This is definitely best for oily, acneic or congested skin but safe for all skin types like most other Tata Harper products. Willow Bark is the second ingredient on this mask, the label says use up to 3x a week but if you have dry skin I would probably use it once a week or even every other week depending on what other exfoliation products you’re already using. This mask is a gel consistency and comes in a jar so you have to scoop out what you need. I like to leave this in the shower so I can leave it on during hair conditioner or treatments and the steam from the shower helps the exfoliation like you're getting a spa facial."

My only complaint on this one is how small of an amount of product that you get in the jar. Other than that, it smells amazing and works wonders. My face feels totally rejuvenated after each use. I look forward to each time I use it. It’s not harsh on the skin either. It’s a jelly that you put on your skin and leave on for 20 minutes before washing off.

This mask is a product to help even the complexion of my skin without compromising my skin barrier. The resurfacing mask is a cocktail of the best ingredients to help refine your skin and lessen the appearance of pores on the face. With the use of this mask, I am happy to say that it does not irritate my skin as normally products with active ingredients tend to cause some sort of reaction and erythema. After incorporating this mask into my routine 2x a week, I can see that it helps add a nice glow to my face and visibly brightens the skin. My skin texture is unfortunately still bumpy in my opinion. It is at a higher price point but worth the money to try it and see if it works well for your skin! Please ignore the red spot on my lower lip area that is a mosquito bite!"

This mask is designed to give you that fresh, glowing skin look, and it really delivers.  First off, the texture is a bit like a gel, which makes it super easy to apply. It’s got a lovely, slightly sweet herbal scent that feels very luxurious and spa-like. I use it a couple of times a week, and I can instantly see a difference. After about 20 minutes, you rinse it off, and your skin looks brighter and smoother. It's like an instant pick-me-up for my face.  The mask uses natural BHA from white willow bark to exfoliate, and pomegranate enzymes to give that deep clean. What I love is how it manages to do all this without being abrasive or irritating. My skin feels soft and fresh afterward, not red or irritated like with some other exfoliating products.  One of the standout effects for me has been how it helps with texture and tone. I have some unevenness and rough patches, and this mask smooths everything out. Plus, it seems to help keep breakouts at bay because of the gentle exfoliation. It really gives you that glow-from-within look.  If you’re in need of a good resurfacing treatment that’s gentle but effective, this mask is definitely worth a try. It’s perfect for when your skin needs a little extra love and radiance."

This mask is specifically designed for those with Dry and Combination skin types, targeting common skincare concerns such as Dullness, Uneven Texture, and Pores. One of the key ingredients that caught my attention is the Natural BHA derived from White Willow Bark Extract. This ingredient provides gentle chemical exfoliation, effectively cleansing and clearing the skin while minimizing the appearance of pores. Additionally, the inclusion of Pomegranate Enzymes works wonders in sloughing off dead skin cells and smoothing out uneven texture. The Pink Clay in the mask helps absorb excess oil and buildup, refining pores for a more radiant complexion. What sets the Tata Harper Resurfacing BHA Mask apart is its commitment to quality and transparency. I appreciate that this product is free of toxins, fillers, artificials, synthetics, and GMOs. Furthermore, knowing that it is vegan and cruelty-free gives me peace of mind, aligning with my values as a conscious consumer.  if you're in search of a product that delivers visible results without compromising on quality or ethics, the Tata Harper Resurfacing BHA Mask is a must-have in your skincare arsenal.

My skin looked and felt amazing afterwards. Not only was it very soft to the touch, but my skin looked healthier and less dull with less pronounced pores as well.

The product also has all-natural ingredients, and as someone who is very conscious about what they put on their face, I love it. After applying, when the mask is drying on my face, it feels like it tightens, which I also enjoy about facemasks when I use them. After washing off the mask, my skin looks so clean and healthy. After using the product for a week and a half, I notice that my skin is glowing, and my texture feels smoother. The only issue I do have with this mask is the quantity of how much you get. I am sadly already almost out of this mask.  "

I’m partial to smaller jars for masks because that obviously makes them easier to travel with.

It's like a reboot for my skin, leaving it feeling refreshed, revitalized, and ready to take on the day.  Don't be afraid to give it a try, guys! Your skin will thank you."

			"review_text": "The TH resurfacing mask is designed to give you an all over face glow. The mask contains natural ingredients such as pomegranate enzymes, white willow bark, and lemongrass to transform a dull looking complexion into a vibrant, glowing one. The BHA acts like a chemical exfoliant to slough away dead skin cells. The texture on this is interesting - like a jellylike consistency, but once spread across the skin, it transforms into a gel. I like that you can use it on its own or layer on top of the regenerating cleanser for an extra boost. After several uses, my skin looks visibly brighter and even. This did not make my skin feel overly tight either. At $68 for 1 oz, it’s pretty pricey for a face mask. However, if you don’t mind the high price tag, this is a good face mask to splurge on."

My skin tends to get dull and rough with blocked pores, but this treatment has been a lifesaver. It’s super easy to use – I just apply a thick layer over my face and neck, leave it on for 20 minutes, and then rinse off with warm water. I usually use it right before work before I put on my makeup, and the results are amazing. I have made it a ritual and now cannot live without it. For an extra boost, I love layering it over the Regenerating Cleanser mid-week and leaving it on for just five minutes. It really amplifies the glow and leaves my skin looking so refreshed and radiant. If you're looking to refresh your skin and tackle blocked pores and rough skin, this mask is a must-have in your routine! I highly recommend!!"

But maybe that's not necessary and it's more eco-friendly to not include one! I'm a really big fan of the fact the ingredients are 100% natural and how it's an enzyme and BHA exfoliant because this type is less common. Enzymes are especially nourishing and brightening for the skin. I will say that the price point is pretty steep: $68 for 1 ounce. And the directions say to use a thick amount so this would only last you a few uses if you're following it like that. I used a thin amount, personally; but to each their own."

I have worked in the beauty industry  so I always love trying out new skincare products because my skin is my major concern right now.   Using the Tata Harper Resurfacing Mask is such a luxurious experience from start to finish. I love the cooling sensation that you feel on your face when you put it on, and then as it dries it tightens and there is a slight tingle. Then as you wash it off it's still thick and almost gel-like so getting to massage it in one more time is nice before it washes away. I've noticed my skin looks really glowy and healthy after I use the mask, which I love! I was hoping to see a change in the overall texture of my skin and pores, especially the pores on my nose since those are the most noticeable, but so far I have not noticed much of a difference.   HOWEVER, I swear now looking at the before to after photos the smile lines on my face look way less and this has been the only change I have made to my skincare routine so - consider me sold because I am too scared to get botox so if this works instead, sign me the heck up!

I have used it three times a week so far and it helped unblock my pores and brightened my skin. There has also been a noticeable difference in improving my skin's texture where it is now more smooth than rough. I love that I can use it any time of the day. It is easy to apply as well as easy to rinse off. It is also a big plus point that it contains botanical ingredients that are vegan and cruelty-free. I give this resurfacing mask five stars for rejuvenating my skin with a beautifully radiant glow. This review was collected as part of a promotion."

			"review_text": "Dear Tata Harper, thank you for taking the time to craft the resurfacing mask! I’ve yet to meet a mask (until now) that exfoliates and truly lifts away dead skin while still keeping my skin hydrated. Additionally, I can tell by using the resurfacing mask that it does not dry my skin out further. There are a lot of resurfacing masks out there but I find they are usually drying and compromising to the skin barrier. Which, makes another issue arise with a compromised skin barrier!   However, this is not the case with Tata Harper. The gel like consistency makes it easy to Apple and remove. My makeup looks absolutely fantastic as well after I use it. A tip from me would be to use the mask when you know you have an event or a day where you want your makeup to go on flawlessly and stay put! Something about the way this masks exfoliates that makes for your foundation and makeup to look so much better and last longer!  This review was collected as part of a promotion"

When I first received this product, I was instantly obsessed with the high quality, beautiful packaging. The floral detail on the lid is so delicate and sweet. I also love that the gold product color mixed with the green packaging reminds me of a caramel apple. This instantly set my standards for the product high.  Personally, I deal with dull skin that comes from having normal to dry skin. I also experience texture on my forehead area. I crave the radiant, glass skin look. I have used a handful of exfoliants with BHA although none have been as gentle on the skin as this one. I have used this three times a week for the last 2.5 weeks and I love that it does not have the intense chemical smell that most exfoliants do. I feel like the resurfacing mask is a high-grade, spa quality product. My skin is glowing and the texture on my forehead after just a couple of weeks is nearly gone and smoothed out. I have never had results like this.  The only con to the product for me is the price – I have 2 weeks max left of the product if I use it the recommended 2-3 times a week. In total, I will get 4-5 weeks of use out of this product for which I personally could not justify paying. This would be more of a luxury purchase for me that I would purchase 1-2 times a year at most rather than a regular rebuy. Overall, I would recommend it as a great, high-end product to treat yourself to if it is in your budget."

			"review_text": "I've been using the Tata Harper Resurfacing Mask three times a week, and it's been transformative for my skincare routine. At 47, I deal with sunspots and wear a lot of sunscreen due to spending significant time swimming outdoors. This mask, with its pomegranate enzymes, dissolves buildup and gives an immediate brightening effect.  This mask provides a deep clean, radiates my skin, and thoroughly cleansing my pores leaving a luminous complexion. I leave it on for 20 minutes and then rinse with warm water. The citrusy scent, likely from the pomegranate enzymes, is refreshing and invigorating. The packaging is luxurious and adds a touch of elegance to my routine.  Since using this mask, I've noticed a significant reduction in blackheads and the gunk beneath my pores. It feels like a spa treatment at home, and my skin looks clearer and more radiant.

It dries quickly and penetrate soon after applying it. You can leave the mask on for 5-10 mins and rinse with warn water. It’s a must try step before make up. It helps my make up stay smoother and helps to have a glowing finish. As it’s already help to clear out oil in pores, it helps my make up look better and stay longer. However, I strongly recommend to use sunscreen after using this mask. Since the ingredients have BHA and AHA, you should apply sunscreen to protect your skin from uv lights. It’s a nice experience to test out this product and I definitely repurchase it in the future."

I have always dealt with acne prone and dull skin. i will start off by saying I love that the product is cruelty free, vegan, and the glass jar it is in! It has a sleek look. I like the thick jelly like substance of the mask.  I was not a fan of the scent, but once you apply it to your face, it is not as strong as it is in the jar. The scent is not bad, but strong in the jar. I am a little disappointed, because I did not notice a glow after using the mask. Maybe it takes longer than a couple weeks to notice. I still have hope for it, but I have not noticed it yet. I will note that even though I do not notice the glow, my face does feel cleaner and softer after rinsing it off! So it is not that I do not recommend it, but do not expect it to work right away.  **This review was collected as part of a promotion."

I was super excited to try this mask as it’s exactly the type of mask I would expect to deliver quick and visible results, and it delivered. I love how you do not need to use a huge amount, so even though this is a small bottle, it should last me several months since I find that once a week use is sufficient to keep my skin balanced and clear.

			"review_text": "I have known this brand as a luxury brand. I am trying this product first time. There are few negatives and  positives experience when I used this product. I was very excited to receive this product but my excitement turned into unpleasant experience when I opened the product. There was no secure tape outside or on the jar itself that which prevent tampering. I  was surpired to see there is no seal of security on the lids as majority of skin products now comes with a seal on lid that makes sure that product is reached with out tampering to the customer. I took the jar out, the product was  leaked out,  gloopy, dried out products under the rim of lid. Look like the product is used and then sent back and I received it now. The absence of seal and leaked product raises doubts.   When I opened the lid the product was smeared inside of lid and falling off. There was a small transparent lid that supposed to sit on the top to prevent this accident, but it was struck in the top of lid. There was spatula or brush provided with the mask. Not at all a pleasant experience of unboxing. Luxury was missing.   The  mask  comes in a 30 ml glass pot. Love the green colour ans golden lid combo and it looks beautiful. The outer packaging is deceptive as  this pot comes in a 50 ml box. They should have used a small pack instead if putting an insert and fixing the 30 ml pot in a 50ml I have dry to nornmal skin and some pigmentation spots. The mask is very gentle on my face . I had no irritation on face . I love the fragrance . It has gel formula and I applied it with a silicone spatula which makes application easy and smooth. It felt like a peel off mask as it was drying and I noticed some tightness while it was drying. After 20 minutes I washed, skin looked clear and it was not dry. I didn’t not see any big difference that was noticeable. I used twice a week.  I like the product itself but in whole it not worth the money neither the quantity nor the experience"

Radiance mask is definitely a luxurious addition to my collection. The packaging is very well made and gives a feeling of great quality. When l first opened the jar l was impressed by the pleasant spa like scent of mask. It smells a bit of citrusy and floral to me. The ingredients are incredible, all natural plants and oils. I believe the less chemicals we put on our skin the better it looks and feels. The texture is like gel , very smooth and spreads easily on the skin. I used it 3 times a week and l loved the look of my skin after: refreshed, radiant, it also looks glowy after you wash off the mask. I think to see the difference you have to use it at least a month. The only minus is that it’s only 1 fl.oz and after using it for 4 times not much is left."

It felt so smooth and looked unbelievably radiant. This creamy, gel-like mask is infused with a delicate blend of Self-Neutralizing AHAs that not only replenished my skin's moisture but also gently exfoliated it, revealing a healthy-looking and glowing complexion.  One of the standout features for me is its amazing scent. The mask has a semi-minty aroma that is both refreshing and soothing, making the application process feel like a luxurious spa experience. As I applied it, I could feel the product locking into my skin, working its magic.  What I appreciate most is that this mask is specially formulated for reactive, stressed, sensitive, or dry skin types. It's hypoallergenic, dermatologist-tested, and vegan, so I feel confident and safe using it on my sensitive skin. Plus, it's free from gluten, wheat, soy, nut derivatives, fragrances, essential oils, and over 85 common allergens and irritants, making it an ideal choice for anyone with specific skin concerns or allergies.  In summary, the Tata Harper Resurfacing Mask is a game-changer. It delivers smooth, radiant skin after just one use and offers a delightful, minty sensory experience. I highly recommend it to anyone looking to revive dull, stressed skin and achieve a healthy, glowing complexion!"

I use it once a week, usually reserving it for those quiet evenings when the house has settled down, and it's just me time.  What I love most about this mask is how it leaves my skin feeling. After just 20 minutes, my face feels refreshed and vibrant, with a noticeable glow that wasn’t there before. It's like pressing the reset button on my skin—any dullness disappears, replaced by a smooth, radiant complexion. The natural ingredients, including willow bark and pomegranate enzymes, work wonderfully to gently exfoliate and renew my skin without any harshness.  Moreover, using this mask feels like a commitment to healthier, more sustainable beauty practices, given Tata Harper's dedication to natural ingredients and environmentally conscious packaging.

My skin was so dry, that I would have patches of dry skin flaking off. Since using this the past week,  I already can tell a noticeable difference! My skin feels more hydrated, and seems to have a healthy glow to it.  I also have noticed a decrease in the dry patches by at least 75%. I am no longer so embarrassed to go out in public, and it really has helped my face physically, as well as me mentally.  I also think the amount in the container is great considering a little product goes a long way! It feels great on my skin, and doesn't leave any greasy residue like others I've tried. This product is a true game change for me and I highly recommend this!!!!!! I received this in exchange for my honest review!"

Upon my first impression, my eyes were gifted with the stunning Emerald green and gold display type box this came in. Then upon opening this gem of a box, I found the starlight gem. This mask comes in a small, yet almost Royal tub, and to say I love the entire packaging is a gross understatement. The frosted glass tub is adorned with a lovely gold embalmed lid that fit securely onto the tub, so there’s no worry about this product drying out! It has a very unique almost jam or jelly type texture, until you spread this on your skin and realize how luxurious and non sticky it is. This smells heavenly. As if a star falling and turning into gold had a smell. It is very organic and has almost magical effects! I noticed immediately after my first use that my skin was brighter, less dull and radiant! I continued use 2 times a week, and there is no other mask like this. It’s very gentle in the sense that it will not cause burning or stinging, yet it is powerful and very effective at its job. I I love products that perform all around, have beautiful packaging, smells amazing , and do exactly what they say they will do. I recommend this to anyone who is willing to invest in their skincare, because that’s exactly what this is. An investment!"

Initially I was worried that I wouldn't get a change to see results in my skin because the jar is 1 ounce, but I quickly realized a little goes a long way. I can easily spread a thin layer over my entire face and what I love is how fast it dries! I was very surprised by the scent, it smells like Citronella which I do like. As it was drying I felt some tingling, but nothing too bad. It was pretty easy to wash off and I definitely did notice a difference in my skin after the first use. My face looks brighter and clean after every use. My skin has pretty bad texture so I have been using the mask up to three times a week as recommended on the box. My nose area has improved the most so far. I don't think this would be good for people with sensitive skin it's on the strong side and the scent is strong so probably not good for people that don't like fragrance either.

I enjoyed using it as it has some wonderful ingredients in it, it has an amazing spa-like scent, and a lovely, comfortable, gentle texture. In addition, the packaging is extremely luxurious as well as sustainable. Unfortunately I haven’t found it to be super effective. It’s not a “bad” product and it’s not totally ineffective, just not effective enough for me to justify giving it a 5 star review which then encourages potential consumers to purchase and possibly be disappointed.

Add in the challenges of middle age, and it's a double whammy for my skin. That’s why I’m in love with Tata Harper skincare and so glad I discovered the Resurfacing Mask. As a skincare enthusiast, I appreciate that it is formulated with BHA from white willow bark and pomegranate enzymes, that turn over dead skin cells to give me more radiant looking skin. With each application it further delivers on its promise to refine pores, smooth and soften skin. The combination of ingredients like pomegranate enzymes, pink clay, lemongrass, beetroot extract, and barley breathes life back into my weather-beaten, dull skin while going to work to prevent blemishes from sweat and grime. My skincare routine now includes applying this glow-inducing mask every other day, immediately after my morning run. While I tend to chores around the house, it works its wonders for 20-30 minutes before I rinse it off in the shower. Afterwards, my complexion is revitalized- it gives my skin a youthful glow despite my age and the battle against sweat and the elements. I alternate using the Resurfacing Mask one day with Tata Harper's Water Lock Moisturizer the next, right after my daily run while my pores are still open from sweating. This duo is my new frontline defense against the toll running and age take on my skin. I highly recommend this mask for anyone who wants to achieve the youthful glow that healthy skin provides, and particularly for athletes who want to treat their skin after a grueling workout."

It is my first time trying Tata Harper brand and I am really impressed! This resurfacing mask came in a glass jar (1oz) which is kinda small to me. It has a gel texture in peachy color. It goes on my face very smoothly and then dries clear later on which I can feel it tightens my skin. My skin also feels really soft and it provides a healthy glow to my dull skin. I am pretty happy with the results so far!  This mask has a herbal and rose combined scent to it as it made with 100% natural ingredients. The key ingredients are pomegranate, willow bark, enzymes and beet root extract. All these can help with refining pores, softening skin, improving dullness and enhancing skin textures. It is recommended to use together with Tata Harper Regenerating cleanser for better results.  Besides the little jar, I am 100% satisfied with this mask. I hope they can make a bigger size jar so my neck can enjoy some too."

The green, glass packaging is so beautiful and looks and feels so luxurious. The mask has a beautiful, bright fruity scent and a jam like texture. It feels and looks like something I could add on toast. This product feels amazing on the skin and really dries down after a few minutes. This mask gives the most beautiful glow after it’s washed off and makes my face feel so hydrated and smooth. I love that this is packed with eighteen high-performing natural ingredients that truly make a difference in how my face feels and looks.

To be fair, I’m not sure how much better my skin can look right now. Tata Harper’s cleansers and moisturizer have done SO much for my skin, truly. I have a beautiful glow that I didn’t have before and my skin looks more even.  The jar is tiny - 1 oz, which is fine, but it’s a very expensive product for what you get. Which again, would be fine if it gave any kind of good results. The directions also say to apply a thick layer so I can’t imagine this will last that long.  I am giving it 2 stars because it smells nice and feels nice on the skin, but i think it needs to be more potent. Maybe it would be different if I didn’t already have a great skincare routine going on, but it is meant to be used in addition to other Tata Harper products and it’s still not delivering.."

It truly is a glow up in a bottle! Once again it contains BHA and Enzymes to help eat away at the dead skin revealing a baby smooth surface.  I am a fanatic about natural ingredients so I absolutely am in love with all the different types of foods, herbs, and botanicals it has such as arnica, lemongrass, pomegranate enzymes, bergamot etc.  what a lovely lush line of products.

Nowadays I am just looking for clean and effective way to take care of my skin and are always would like to be in the know of what new and exciting things are happening in beauty and aestetics world.  Tata Harper Resurfacing Mask is coming in a glass jar and has a golden lid like most of the products in the line I received. The packaging feels heavy and luxurious but definitely on the smaller side.  The texture of Tata Harper Resurfacing Mask is on a gritty side so it can thoroughly resurface and exfoliate. This mask did not dry me out and was pretty calming on my skin which is a huge plus for somebody having skin sensitivities and reactiveness.  I would recommend this mask to anybody looking to indulge themselves into a nice not overly fragrant textural mask getting rid of congested pores, promoting smoother facial skin and radiance."

The container is a little smaller but it’s because you don’t need to use a lot and this isn’t something you need to apply daily. This mask really help with dull skin or clogged pores and of course the occasional rough or dry patch. My favorite part about it is that you can’t leave it on for to long which is something I definitely have done before. I love that the ingredients made it so it won’t harm your skin if you accidentally fall asleep while wearing it. My favorite way to use this mask is after using her cleanser and then finishing it off with her moisturizer. The bottle and packaging itself is so pretty as they all are, my vanity has never looked better ! I definitely recommend this mask to all skin types, as it has benefits for everyone."

I always have some sort of irritation and dryness following the use of facial masks. When using Tatas mask 3x a week, I haven't had any irritation whatsoever. I love the texture. It's gel like but not sticky. It glides on my skin like silk, and there isn't much scent. Like the clarifying cleanser, it has a nice cooling sensation when first applied. It's also vereasy to use and not time-consuming at all. I apply it to my face and neck, and over the next 20 minutes, it slowly dries. It's easy to remove with warm water or a disposable towel. Afterward, my skin feels hydrated and plump but also has a beautiful glow. I've been using Tatas' resurfacing mask three times a week for the past two weeks, and I can honestly say that I've noticed my skin texture is much more even. It's less bumpy and just overall looks smooth and healthy.  I'm truly amazed at the results that I'm seeing, and 100% would purchase this mask over and over as it's the best that I've ever used."

Tata Harper is an amazing natural luxury beauty/skincare brand! This resurfacing mask is a glow treatment that instantly restores radiance that helps with blocked pores, dull, or rough skin.  My first impression is that this resurfacing mask came in a really small jar (1 fl oz) with a hefty price tag for $68. The Tata Harper Resurfacing Mask has a nice peachy colored gel texture that smoothly applied to my skin then dried clear! It tingled a little bit and I could feel the mask firming my face and neck! It had a beautiful pleasant rose and herbal plant scent. This mask uses nourishing ingredients 100% from nature! It contains high performance botanical ingredients such as willow bark, pomegranate enzymes, and beet root extract! These high performance botanical ingredients help create an amazing rosy glow, refines pores, and soften skin texture!  After rinsing off the Tata Harper Resurfacing Mask, I noticed immediate positive results on my aging dull skin with dark spots! My skin felt and looked incredible soft, my skin was noticeably brighter, glowing, and my pores looked less visible! This mask definitely delivers instant results! It is recommended to also use the Tata Harper Resurfacing Mask in conjunction with the Tata Harper Regenerating cleanser.  I highly recommend the Tata Harper Resurfacing Mask if you are looking to revive your dull dry skin with an instant glow. However, the price tag is pretty hefty for such a small jar and you don’t get much for the price. It is still worth the price tag if you are able to afford this mask!"

The Tata Harper Resurfacing Mask packaging is really pretty and classy and looks good sitting on your countertop. The mask is very gel like an easy to apply and has a pleasant but hard to place smell to it. It’s some thing you would expect to smell in a spa setting. As a medical aesthetician in a spa, a lot of our botanical products smell similar to this mask. my biggest negative about this product is it’s very small for a product. They recommend you use 2 to 3 times a week and its price point is $68. It’s only 30 mL which is not very much at all maybe five or six masks worth which when you divide that out by the cost is a pretty expensive mask. I think honestly a lot of people would be turned off by the price of that when they see how big the mask actually is."

Recently I have been using the Resurfacing Mask by Tata Harper. And honestly it's not as amazing as I was hoping it would be. This mask comes in a very esthetic 1 fl oz/ 30 ml glass jar. Its priced at $68, definitely a luxury product with a high price tag that not all may be able to afford.   I like that this mask is easy to apply. It has a jelly like texture and once I started to apply it went on very smoothly on my skin. The jelly like texture feels very soothing and gives a cooling effect on my skin. The mask dries fairly quickly and forms a clear film like texture which is easy to wash off.  I also really liked the fragrance of this mask. It smells really beautiful. The combined smell of willow bark, rose, bergamot, lemongrass, and pomegranate all provide for a delightful experience.  Now as far as results are concerned I am a little disappointed. Because I did not notice a vast difference in my skin even after having finished the entire jar of this mask. Yes my skin felt clean after washing my face but honestly that can be accomplished with using any regular face mask. I was hoping that as promised this mask will transform dull complexion into vibrant, glowing one. However, I did not find this to be true in my case.  To conclude I would not recommend this mask to others because I feel this mask is very expensive for the amount of product that you will be get. As stated above the jar is only 1 oz and you will only be able to get 3-4 uses out of it before the container is empty. I don't consider this a must-have item rather a splurge item because in my opinion there are far better face mask in the market that provide instant results with half the price of this mask.  **This review was collected as part of a promotion."

The sample size was 3ml - just enough for a single use to cover my face and neck, whilst still leaving a small amount in the sachet to try out as a spot treatment. The mask is a gel-texture which has a peachy/pink tint and a distinctive Rose Geranium fragrance. Funnily enough it tingled within 3 minutes after applying, but only for a minute or so, after which I felt nothing at all. At just under 20 minutes I noticed it was starting to dry-out and lose adherence on certain areas of my face (chin and between eyebrows especially) and so I figured it was a good time to remove before it starts to flake off and create a mess! It does leave a slightly 'slimy' feel on the skin as you wash it off, and which took me a good few minutes to remove completely. So what did it achieve? Well unfortunately my pores were exactly the same as they were 20 minutes prior, whilst my skin on the other hand had a nice subtle glow to it. There was no other discernible difference, in texture, clarity etc. I did also use it on a couple of acne bumps overnight as a spot treatment. It helped, but the difference was not as pronounced as Paula's Choice 10% AHA or The Ordinary's Niacinamide. For me this was just an averagely good mask, although I much prefer Tata's Clarifying Mask over this.     ~ My Sephora Top 7 must-have list ~  (My top 7 must-have beauty products of all time, focusing mainly on my purchases at Sephora)  1.

I leave on for 20 minutes during which time it dries down and it is pretty easy to rinse off. I’m left with softer skin that looks more radiant. I think this helps purge my skin when I need it because I felt a bump on my chin that hurt as if a large pimple was forming and after using this, the next morning it had a small white head which allowed the pimple to disappear faster.

I’m pretty experienced with acids so I thought that this was a great and gentle exfoliant! I personally did not experience any tingling. But when I rises the mask off after twenty minutes my face was significantly softer! I applied the rest of my routine (holi frog toner, peach and lily essence, yttp hyaluronic acid serum, and the Ameon moisturizer) and my skin this morning is so plump and bright!!! It’s actually insane. I think it’s best to do a hydrating routine following the use of this mask. My only compliant is the size!!! I know that there is a demographic who can afford this but $65 for one fluid ounce is out of reach for most beauty lovers. I really enjoyed this mask but the size and price tag did dampen the experience."

Upon application the mask spreads easily, a thin layer is more than enough as a little goes a long way, it then starts  dries down with the feel of tightening which I believe is when it starts working on my pores exfoliating my skin. The process takes about 30 minutes to complete than I rinse with tepid water for a fresh and glowy. This is perfect for my skin during these warmer days!"

It does have a scent that isn’t overpowering which is nice. Iv found it works best with the (what I call) Tata Trick. Applying the regenerating Cleanser and then this on top. If I have a breakout and use this I find it is significantly reduced the next day. It’s an absolutely wonderful Mask that does what it’s supposed to. I will say that for anyone who is saying “my pores look the same” or “my blackheads are still there”. Yes, and they will be. Pores do not shrink however, their appearance can. And as far as blackheads go there is no topical product on this earth that will remove your blackheads, the only way to remove them is having them professionally extracted. So yes, I do think this product lives up to its standards and beyond."

I spend a lot on skincare but thought the price for this product was very high, considering the small quantity and the amount to be used each application. I went ahead and purchased it anyway. It was good for the first few uses. As I mentioned, I spend a lot on skincare and I have a lot of masks that I use in rotation. Hence I was using this on special occasions, necessary appointments, and not every week. However, in even just a short period of time, it became like a water pill. I saw no effectiveness of the product whatsoever. It just didn't do anything anymore. I tried applying more each time, but it was the same. I fathom that the natural ingredients Tata Harper uses lose their efficacy extremely quickly. I ended up finishing the product but only getting a few good uses out of it. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone who wants to use it past a couple to few months because of the issue I faced. I'm not sure if anyone else had this issue. I decided to give it a 3 star ranking because it did work effectively at the beginning, so the product is not lacking, but the preservation of it."

After washing off, yes, I notice a beautiful glow and my skin feels tighter and pores look smaller. I have lots of other products I'm using that help with glow, dullness and texture though (like other chemical and enzyme peels, AHA and vitamin C products, retinol) but for skin tightening and pores, nothing exciting. I also use a BHA serum from The Inkey List, which helps with blackheads but still, not noticing anything impressive for pores. What's the magic ingredient(s) in this? The pink clay, the willow bark? Could I find another product for cheaper, maybe probably, but I don't currently know what that is. Maybe I can score this on sale. Or maybe I need another sample to decide if it's worth it. But purchase this at $65 for only one ounce? Right now, I just can't. "

It’s the epitome of a company that cares about what they’re putting out there & I think with an over saturated beauty market we need to be smart consumers & buy from companies that take pride in what they make & what they put into their products. Every product is crafted with care & quality—from the overall product itself, it’s ingredients to its packaging. And Tata Harper’s Resurfacing Mask is no different. Because they formulate, manufacture & package their products directly on their farm in Vermont you can tell that the quality is there in the product. I spread a thick layer of the mask on my face & it spreads like butter. It is so smooth & glides across my face like a dancer. It is a strong mask, so I want to give notice to those with sensitive skin types that it may be too strong for you to use or at least use on a more regular basis because of it being a BHA based mask. But for me it was perfect & clears away the debris of the week & gives me a clean canvas to work with. My pores look & feel smaller, my skin feels softer & more even & my face has a glow that wasn’t apparent before I used it.  It has helped other products work better because it gets rid of all the junk on my skin without irritating, damaging, or drying it out. In fact it feels like it’s more moisturized & glowy than ever.  I’ve taken to using it 2-3 times a week to give me a spa like experience at home—bc this product definitely screams luxury."

It has a nice light citrusy scent and feels good on your skin, it does tighten as it dries but I personally like that. My skin felt and looked so nice and smooth after but honestly a little dry as with most exfoliants so just follow up with a moisturizer and you're good to go.

Using this mask weekly, keeps my skin looking supremely soft and smooth to the touch. I’ve been noticing my skin appearing more radiant. It definitely has an over all glow to it. My face looks much more youthful since I’ve been using this mask. It works amazingly well on my dry sensitive skin. I’ve also noticed my pores are much more diminished. I have really sensitive skin and this mask was extremely gentle on my face. I’m definitely purchasing this this mask as soon as I run out."

I’ve heard a lot about Tat Harper and this brand can really be hit or miss. For me, this mask wasn’t a complete hit or a miss. It was just a basic product.   The texture is gel like but as soon as you rub it onto the skin it dissolves instantly like water, which I definitely enjoyed. After letting it dry down you could tell there was something on the face but the feeling didn’t linger for long. I rinsed off after the stated 20 minutes and did notice a nice glow to the skin. The smell is the only thing that sort of bothered me. It isn’t horribly strong but I could get a citrusy fragrance out of it and it bothered me enough to cause me a headache after about 10 minutes of having it on.   If you have zero issue with smells, this could definitely be the mask for you! But if you’ve got a nose as sensitive as mine, definitely beware!"

It feels very refreshing when applying to the skin that I even think would make a very nice cool mask for the summer (especially if you put it in the fridge:)). It has a very clean and fresh scent which I like since scents on the face just seem to stick longer. When you apply, it applies smooth and when it starts drying, it gets a bit harder. It's easy to wash off with just some water and leaves you skin feeling soft and smooth. I have oily skin and it still left my skin very soft and refreshed however, I did not see any improvements in brightness at all so I would not buy this based off that. I think it's just a nice cooling mask. As far as exfoliation, it gives you a cleaner feel but I don't think it removed any dead skin since it's very gentle and jelly like. I would probably used this as a refreshing and cooling mask after having gone through other treatments. I do love that this product is marked as Clean Beauty but I would most likely not purchase this in the future. This was gifted by Tata Harper Skincare in exchange for my honest review."

I am a true believer now and I am going to order the Regenerating Cleanser as well to use in conjunction with the Resurfacing Mask. I love the ingredients and the smell of this mask and more importantly I love the results!! Apply the mask to clean skin wait about 15-20 minutes and wash off with warm water..super easy for amazingly noticeable results!!"

I always wanted this resurfacing mask because I have always heard great reviews about especially in the ability to heal acne scarring. So far I haven't seen the long term results of it but the short term has definitely won me over. The application is like smooth cool jelly with a nice refreshing citrus scent. My skin felt clean and slightly tight and ever so slightly tingly after each use. It was a wonderful experience, my skin overall felt smoother and less oily. I have dry acne-prone skin for reference. I think the exfoliation is gentle enough for consistent usage so far I will be using it twice a week."

When I first applied this to my skin it had a cooling sensation and has a jelly like texture, which makes it easy to apply and spread across the skin. It has a subtle fruity scent, which is refreshing. Once, applied to my face and neck I allowed the product to sit on my skin for about 20 minutes and it hardened onto my skin like a clay mask, but better. It was a easy and mess free process to rinse from my skin and it left my skin glowing and softer than before. I could tell that my skin was brighter and more radiant than before. It does gently exfoliate skin and is gentle enough to be used a few times a week. I definitely recommend this mask to others!"

Tara Harper cut no corners when it came to this beautiful product - the packaging is impeccable with a soft matte touch box and the jar component is super luxurious; a night weighted glass jar with gold accents. I appreciate beautiful packaging, but we all know it’s the product inside that matters! This resurfacing mask is best for those with dull skin or have rough / textured skin. This mask contains BHA’s and enzymes to help renew the skin so you are left with more radiant and renewed skin! I’ve used this mask three times and definitely notice a difference - especially with the current dry, cold winter air, my skin has been especially dull and rough from dryness. This mask gives me a beautiful glow and my skin feels soft & smooth! This will definitely be a repurchase product for me & I am looking forward to trying more from this brand in the future!"

The 2nd time I used it alone, and it worked fantastically! My skin felt so much smoother afterward, although I did experience some redness. It was not painful or itchy though, so no harm, no foul! It has a lightly citrus scent, in my opinion, and smooths onto the skin easily. I DO wish it had come with some sort of applicator, however. All in all, a GREAT product, but be aware it is fragranced, and does contain alcohol, so may not be the best thing for extremely sensitive skin."

I did not have any negative reactions after 20 minutes and I do have sensitive skin, my skin looked so bright and glowing afterwards and my makeup applied so much better.

This gives my skin an instant glow and hydration to my tired skin. It is gentle on the skin, and this natural treatment helps to clear skin, refine pores while smoothing and softening the skin texture. It is easy to use, just apply a good amount of layer of this mask onto the skin with your fingertips, leave it on for at least 20 minutes and then rinse it off with lukewarm water. My skin is already glowing just after using it a few times. It feels softer, moisturized, and amazingly beautiful. I would recommend this to everyone to try it.   It’s is packed with powerful ingredients like: White Willow Bark that cleanses and refines the pores. Pomegranate Enzymes that exfoliate and cleanse the skin.  Pink Clay that it pulls out the dirt including excess oil and pollutants which keeps the pores clogged. Beet Root Extract effectively moisturizes the skin.  All in all, I am very impressed with this mask. I am using it twice a week and so far I loved the results. It not only makes my skin smoother but it also improves my skin texture.

Definitely a very high functioning aha mask, this left my face smooth and glowy! I was surprised that it felt as though it was almost soaking in as it was on my face. I guess i kind of expected it to sit in the skin, but no, she goes deep.. as it dried it got a bit tacky and almost made my face feel tightened in areas, nothing unpleasant or uncomfortable. It smells like roses, and for being an all natural product with no artificial fragrance, i was surprised at was how potent the smell was.. It smells good but it is very pungent, and personally I do prefer a lighter scent. Overall i was very pleased with the performance of this mask and although it pains me to say it, I could see spending the money for this. I do feel like I get similar results when I use my less expensive aha mask, but not in one use like this one. Definitely recommend if you want to glow to the high heavens and splurge a bit."

At first I thought it was going to absorb into my skin because it's clear but after a few minutes I could see and feel a smooth, thin layer over my skin! After about 10 minutes (half way through), I could feel my skin tingling, almost but not quite stinging. After washing it off, my face felt so light, cool, super smooth and it was definitely brighter!!! I definitely can't use this daily and even a few times per week may be too much.

The hardest part for me to  review is the scent for any product, mostly because I do not find many products to have a welcoming scent (for me).

The mask has a cooling effect.   Rinse off and pat face dry with clean dry towel.  My face feels amazingly soft and hydrated.  I still smell the scent lingering after for a bit of time, so I was happy!    This is noted to be gentle enough to use a few times a week.  Good for oily and combination skin and targets dullness, pores & uneven texture.    This is my first product i have tried from Tata Harper and am very happy so far.

I had not even seen those injuries for years, and this made them look new.  I will go back to the products from other companies that use five or eight organic ingredients, since they make me look great and younger.  This company's approach does not work for me at all, like having 347 ingredients in the kitchen doesn't mean they would make a good stew all together.

Pros: I really appreciate that this formula is easily build-able  and has the flexibility wear time of short term or long term (overnight).

I’m a total beauty addict (with combination-skin), and there isn’t much I haven’t tried in the way of skincare- especially masks that are resurfacing/peeling. Since many others use this mask and love it, I have to assume it’s a good option for someone who has very sensitive skin and can’t use the stronger masks that I see real results from (you do have to build up to using those). For someone like me that is used to stronger masks, I recommend The Ordinary AHA 30% + BHA 2% Peeling Solution Mask. It’s way less expensive, and you see instant, glowing results."

I also have never used any BHA or AHA products in my life so I was a little nervous to try, having sensitive skin and all. The directions actually weren’t on the jar, it’s a tiny 7.5 mL jar, I had to look them up and it said to leave on for 20 minutes and apply a generous amount. Very unfortunate, that there was only enough in the jar for 1 use. Spreading it thinly even only left me with a tiny bit smudged at the bottom of the jar. I used this after cleansing my skin with my Raeka tumeric facial scrub. It was a little hard to apply to my skin because it has like a jello consistency lol so sometimes it slides off my face if I don’t rub it in immediately. There was no burning feeling but a slight tingling sensation during the first few minutes. I could feel my pores start to breath while wearing the mask. Rinsing it off was very easy and quick which I enjoyed! After removal, I was surprised to see that my face was not inflamed, dry or burning. It was a welcome surprised. I either apply my usual moisturizer or a hydrating sweet chef kale facial mask but I don’t feel that I need to after using the mask. That’s just what I like to do when doing a facial. I definitely notice right off the bat after removing the mask that my pores have been cleaned. It makes my acne scars disappear, evens my skin tone, adds a glow to my skin, hydrates my skin and heals any acne that was there to start with. It also keeps me acne free while I use it!!! I definitely suggest this mask since it is made of the best ingredients for your skin AND it worked for my sensitive skin, so it should work for anybody’s!!!!"

I’m sure results would be amazing with regular use and if the price was lower to be able to test that theory, I’d probably give it 5 stars.  I’ve repurchased the 1 oz full size jar a few times after first receiving a sample. I just caved and bought the limited addition 3.33 oz jar and if you can splurge, do it. The brush alone is worth it. Before I was using a MAC flat shader foundation brush, as I do to apply all my fake masks. But the Tata Brush that comes in the set picks up the PERFECT amount of product so you can apply a thin, even layer. Any other brush you use will require you to ‘scoop’ up a glob to apply a thick layer, which we probably all like because we feel like more product means better results. But in this case, it’s not needed, and the Tata brush will help to make this huge limited edition size jar last even longer.   I waited almost a month to decide to buy the LE size and I caved because I didn’t want to miss out if it’s unavailable after the holidays. I’m so glad I did. Get it."

I have to say, this Resurfacing Mask just didn't wow me like the serum did. This is a decent mask; it smells good and left my skin feeling softer than before I applied it. I do like Tata Harper's commitment to producing natural, clean products, and I liked her other products so much I think that I was just left underwhelmed by this. To me, this is comparable to a great many resurfacing masks that are on the market in both specialty retailers and drugstores. No better, and no worse. But for this price...I want something that is holy grail status. There is absolutely nothing that sets this mask apart in my mind, especially when I can go get a tube of Alba Botanicals enzyme peel for a fraction of the price with the same results.

Willow Bark Extract is not a BHA, and does not provide the chemical exfoliation experienced with salicylic acid. - Why does any skincare company, let alone a high-end skincare company, still use jar packaging? It isn't hygienic or stable. - Quality ingredients are expensive, but $65 for one ounce of a mediocre fragranced aloe mask (grown on the finest organic farm or not) is insulting."

If you already use exfoliants you probably don’t need to use this mask 2-3 times a week but I definitely suggest initially using this 3 days consecutively with a gentle cleanser and no other exfoliants!  It’s expensive but that’s what I would expect from a brand like Tata Harper. The jar is small but always seems to last longer than I think it will! I’ve repurchased several times over the years."

The next morning I had horrific breakouts. It’s not anywhere near that time of the month and all the other skincare I’ve been using are my usual go-to’s so it had to be this. So now I’m trying to deal with the resulting breakouts. I’ve been using the Clinique all over clearing treatment to spot treat the white heads and Fresh’s Umbrian clay purifying mask as a spot treatment on the massive cystic spot I have. So far they seem to be helping. If you have very reactive skin I suggest asking for a sample to try a little bit at a time. Or just avoid it altogether."

The infection would spread from my chin up, it was painful and inflamed, and skin was very bumpy and irritated. I could not hide it under makeup at all. I tried Farmacy, Philosophy, Caudalie aha/bha products - nothing helped. Then I read the reviews for this mask, I already had it but before I applied it for 20 mins only and didn’t see any results. Some reviews suggested leaving it overnight on affected areas. I did this every night for a week and completely got read of the infection. Of course, since the mask contains acids, you’ll get dry skin, you are basically burning skin with acid, and you’ll have to take extra care of it, it might not work for you if you have super sensitive skin but it literally saved me! I don’t know how bad it would be if I didn’t start applying it every night, and I’m so grateful for this product and for all kind people leaving reviews for products and telling about their experience!"

My skin doesn’t have the smoothest surface from acne damage during my high school days, but I do notice after I use this product it does appear to give my face a smooth look. It also does help minimize breakouts.  I have combination skin—oily on my T-zone and dry on the cheeks.  It does have a super drying effect of the mask during treatment; however, AFTERWARDS I do notice a hydrating effect on my cheeks and a less oily T-zone—especially more so in the morning. I usually buy the value package deal bc alone this product is a little on the pricey side. However with this last purchase I just went ahead and got the jar only bc I love this product the best out of the Tata Harper line. I use this product roughly every other day, so roughly 2-3 times a week depending on what my skin needs. Use at night before bed for best results! Seriously try at least a sample next time!"

I know I should try it because it received such amazing reviews but that is way too much money for a product that small, especially when the directions say to “apply a thick layer over face and neck”.  If I applied a thick layer, the product would be gone in 3 uses!  All other masks I have (some more expensive like tatcha) give you at least 1.7oz.  I’m obsessed with skincare and spend way too much money, and I really love the all natural thing, but there definitely isn’t enough product to justify the cost unless it’s fricken magic!

I was worried that the DE and Kate Somerville resurfacing products would be too harsh for me, so I decided to give Tata Harper a try, since it's all-natural. I am so impressed with the results. The mask definitely exfoliates without leaving my skin red and angry. It takes some practice to get the thickness right - I usually slather it all over and then build up the product in areas that need extra help. I would definitely use a brush for application, because I found it difficult to grab the product with my finger. The smell is also lovely without being overpowering!"

My skin normal with the exception of the area right around my nose, here I have rosacea. You know, the normal place it shows up, inner cheek area?  I can't use any BHA, just inflames my skin in this area. I apply this all over the face except right on my rosacea and the result is truly unbelievable.  I can't believe this is my skin, it is so smooth!  I do have melasma spots and there are still there, but after foundation my skin is almost flawless which is not the norm for me.   Sorry this is such a long review, but there is so much to say about this mask.  It's what I hoped to find in so many products that never delivered.

Fast forward to two weeks ago. I was at Sephora and it was being promoted with their boutique brands or emerging beauty brands or something like that. My face (combination skin) was feeling congested and based on the description (and, not gonna lie, scent) I decided to try it out. I began using as directed several times a week and noticed a change in my skin within the first week. It was smoother, seemed more even and the few small bumps I had on my face disappeared. I am in love. I use another brand of serum and night transformation gel and the three seem to work beautifully together... though based on my experience with the Tata Harper resurfacing mask, I'll definitely be trying more of this brand's products.

But you serious do not need a lot! So not only does it feel amazing on your skin, but I have VERY sensitive skin and it does not irritate it whatsoever. I haven’t had a product I was this happy with in a while. There were dramatic results for me overnight! A little story about my sensitive skin for you - this past weekend my mom got a new laundry detergent and when she hugged me I could tell it was different. That very day my face started breaking out. I had about 20 teeny tiny zits on my cheeks. Made my cheeks extremely red. I got the kit on Monday, by the way, Monday morning I woke up and my face was so red it looked like I just put blush all over my cheeks. So that night I got home from work, washed my face, put the mast on, cleaned it off then used the moisturizer. Tuesday - Not only did I only have THREE zits but ALL the redness was gone. This has been like a miracle kit for my sensitive skin! It feels great, it doesn’t burn, and the mask doesn’t get so hard it hurts your face. I definitely recommend this to someone with highly sensitive skin. I don’t know if it’s supposed to help with breakouts too but it definitely worked for that too!"

I then went in the shower and let my face steam a bit before washing it off. Later, I toned and moisturized my face and I could already feel the difference. I then applied the mask every single day for the rest of the week. My skin has changed. It feels amazing now. No clogged feeling, nothing. just smooth and soft. Now I use the mask once or twice a week. the frequency depends on how my skin is feeling. I love using it when my hormones are off balance, helps keep the oiliness under control and prevents any hormonal breakouts. Try it if you haven't already! It's well worth the price."

BUT DAB IT IN SCARS & PITTING AND THE MIRACLE HAPPENS! I am 47 years old and have used more skin products than I can shake a stick at. I am not easily impressed, but this resurfacing mask has knocked me out. I got it free in my Sephora play box. I bought a full size before I even finished the trial.  I AM NOT RICH! I AM BROKE! THIS IS WORTH IT!!  JUST DAB A LITTLE AND LEAVE ON OVERNIGHT. IT WILL LAST YOU FOREVER!   I did not try it out initially because I already use Erno Laszlo double cleanse (deep cleanse black bar...that is awesome, too) and a Japanese peeling mask (the kind you put on and rub immediately and produces eraser-like particles.) I was very happy with how my skin was progressing to absolute smoothness. I must add that I am Black, so my aging process is significantly slower and I do not have any wrinkles. That being said, I do have issues with very oily skin and large pores. Not much in the way of regular acne, however I do have some texture issues.  I followed the advice of a previous reviewer and dabbed the product on some acne pitting and a weird keloid scar, my skin has a tendency to react poorly to damage. The first day, after leaving it on all night, was surprising. I thought I saw some changes, but thought perhaps I was just trying to see things. I tried it again the next night. The following morning I saw that the scarring was going away. I still thought I was crazy… Until the third night.....  I AM NOT CRAZY! THE SCARS AND PITS ARE GOING AWAY. I asked others if they were seeing the same thing and they agreed. I am on night number 7 and still using the trial size and dabbing in a little bit on with a Q-tip. I expect my scoring to be gone in another couple of days. I plan to continue using the mask on an occasional basis and this will justify the high price.  As it says in the title, my mama don't lie and she sees a difference. So do I and this stuff works!"

I have horrible hormonal acne which for me means I get tiny bumps covering my entire forehead and super deep, huge cystic acne on my cheeks and jaw. It got so bad I seriously googled the words skin transplant. I had a sample of this sitting on my makeup table for months and then finally got around to trying it. I was surprised by the texture when I first opened it, a very slippery watery jelly. I love the scent and am very glad that it's not perfumed, it's real plant smells. I left the mask on for the whole 30 minutes. My face did get super tight while the mask was on, but it felt nice like it was actually working. When time was up, I swiped the back of my hand over my forehead and I actually gasped. The gross scabby texture on my forehead was gone! I washed it off as fast as I could and immediately noticed that my skin was really glowing. I used 2 Sunday Riley oils after and when I woke up in the morning about 1/4 of the acne on my forehead was gone and the deep purple cysts on my cheeks looked so much lighter. I ran to the store the very next day to get a full sized tub! I've been using exactly as recommended - 3 days in a row and then 1-2x a week from then on. So in total I've used this probably 7 times and my skin has dramatically changed. The forehead acne is 1/2 gone and I only have 2 smaller cheek cysts remaining! Plus, all my old scarring is so much lighter. I am so happy to have found this product and will continue to use until all of my acne has disappeared!"

When I used it as a mask and left it on for only a few minutes, I saw minimal results.

I kept doing it, thinking I would soon enough see some evidence of sensitivity or other negative effects but to my surprise, my skin only continued to improve.

It has completely changed the texture of my skin; it looks and feels smoother, scars have basically disappeared, and any breakouts are gone. Even after 1 use it works. The directions say to apply a thick layer and I have found that is exactly what should be done, I tried using a thin layer and it didn't take as well. I have read the owner of the company uses this as an overnight mask, I want to try but it does get a bit hard and I don't think I can sleep in it. I love this mask so much and I can't wait to try the rest of the line, I want everything!"

It did make the skin around my cheeks and nose feel a little tight, and you do have to use a generous amount of the product to get a thick layer so the sample was only used 2-3 times by me.  Would I purchase this? Yes possibly in the future when I have some extra spending money and want to invest in a weekly mask.  Is it a game changer? Not really. It does add radiance but there are other methods to getting that look that aren't as expensive. I have very clear skin, so I can't say how it would work for those with skin issues.  I would definitely recommend for those with clear but sensitive skin that just want a little extra boost to brighten them up."

I had tried a Tata Harper face oil before and hated it and assumed I would hate this as well but got it as a free sample.  Didn't notice much the night I put it on and took it off but the next day my skin looked brighter.  The day after that my redness and skin bumps were almost non existent!!!  I am out of town now and left the sample home but will be tackling it and muttering about it being my preciousssss once I am home.  I ordered the full size and am actually hopeful for my skin for the first time since this horrid skin issue reared its head.   My skin also feels much smoother, like porcelain.  Putting makeup on made me look ten years younger (I'm 37) and I didn't even have to use concealer on what are normally terrible hereditary dark circles under my eyes.  I would spend $500 on these sorts of results!  I didn't have to use much either.  I could probably get five or six more uses out of just the sample."

From my personal experience, I don't think this item's price tag is justified for the size of the pot.  Product consistency is very thin and gel-like, smell is strong in the pot but less evident once applied to your face, gradually wears off as the product dries as well.  Felt an initial tingling when I first applied it to my face but this sensation subsided fairly quickly and did not happen again throughout masking. Mask sets and dries pretty quickly, maybe I did not apply enough product but it's so thin and peachy in colour that after applying it doesn't actually look like anything is on your face. I let it sit for 12 minutes and decided that that was long enough for my first application (as it indicates 10 mins is sufficient for sensitive skin), thinking I might try 20 next time and see if that creates a more dramatic effect?  Outcome of first experience: pores appear to have reduced, somewhat. Face seems maybeee mildly more glowy but nothing to rave about."

It is also incredibly gentle, and doesn't irritate at all. I am used to a burning sensation when using a product that works this well, so when I first used it I thought something was wrong and that it wouldn't give me the results I wanted. Very pleasantly surprised that it is so effective without any burning, redness, or itchy dry skin."

Be certain to remove after recommended time if you have sensitive skin like me or it will cause a slight redness. After rinsing the mask off, my skin felt softer, smoother and glowing. The dead skin was gently wiped away. It's a fabulous facial treatment. Wish it was not that costly though..."

The first time I used it as instructed on the box: first apply the Regenerating Cleanser, then the Resurfacing Mask on top of it, then leave for ten minutes. I couldn't see any difference in my face. The next time I used it I followed the directions under the full size product on the website: apply to clean skin, leave for 20-30 minutes. This time, the mask made a world of difference. It did irritate and burn my skin and turn it red (only the second time), but the results were amazing. (Note: I do not have sensitive skin.)  I always have these dry, flakey, textured, porous patches on the sides of my nose. I could never seem to get rid of them no matter how much I tried with granular exfoliants and enzyme powders. However, this mask completely eliminated those rough patches, and it is the only thing I've found thus far that does. When I was applying concealer around my nose afterward, it went on soo smoothly and looked flawless. Putting foundation on was like painting a ceramic figurine, my skin was so refined. It's like the mask really eats away the tiniest of dead skin particles and refines every pore.  If you don't have super sensitive skin and can withstand this mask for 20 minutes, it is definitely worth it."

My skin is somewhat sensitive, and will usually be a bit delicate or even red following a new mask, but this wasn't the case here at all. It's a pink-tinged jellylike texture that feels a bit like smoothing grape jelly over one's face. I leave it on for about 25-30 minutes, it dries transparent and only mildly tightens as it dries (not uncomfortable at all; if you make to effort to talk a little bit around the 5-10 min mark, you won't feel like you're breaking the seal when/if you suddenly get chatty 20 minutes in). I then wash it off with warm water and some mild massaging (this takes a few moments actually, to remove it fully from the face and neck). After patting dry, my skin feels very fresh, definitely like it's been exfoliated but not at all sensitive or raw from the experience (even following it with an exfoliating toner or serum doesn't feel like overkill). I'd almost even describe it as matte looking/feeling, but you still definitely get a little glow going on afterwards. I realize that saying something gives you a matte glow seems totally contradictory, but just trust me and go with it. I'd definitely recommend it to almost anyone, people both new and experienced with chemical exfoliation. It's gentle but very effective. I'm slowly falling in love with Tata Harper's entire line, the products I've tried so far are super solid, but this is definitely their star product."

First use, skin is calmer, more clear, bumps reduced, pores smaller. By week 2 (using 3x/ week), the bumps were almost totally gone. 1 month in and I'm back to people stopping me on the street to ask what products I use. I *glow*. No pores, no bumps, no melting makeup, no red or dry spots, no weird afternoon oil slick. I feel like the amount of product and benefit you get for the price makes this mask the best bang for your buck in Tata's line. I have no idea what the directions say (I'm far too impatient and arrogant to read those things), so here's what I do: after exercise/ work out I wipe down the the hydrating essence, slather on a generous layer, step into the shower and do my hair/ body thing with the mask on for about 10 mins.

When I read for instant glow at first, I thought yeah right, but those words really do deserve to be written on the package.  After using this mask, your face feels very clean, smooth, clear, and super fresh. A little but also goes a very very long way. I've used it a couple times and every time I open the container, it still looks like I've never used it. It's also very comfortable to wear, you don't even feel like you're wearing a mask (no stinging, or drying feeling, or even feeling like u have goop on your face)"

			"review_text": "This is a great and effective product; you can really feel it getting to work on your skin the second you apply it. The reason I gave this mask 3 stars however, is mostly because of the price. For the amount of product you get, this seems quite expensive to me, even compared to pricier brands. I only get a handful of uses out of one jar- maybe enough for 5 or 6 applications.  The consistency is very different from most masks I've used in the past. It is goopy and gel-like. You can feel the gel hardening and drying on your face, which eliminates pores and tightens skin big time! I leave this on for about 30 minutes and my face feels fresh and revitalized afterwards.  I would recommend this for use in summer rather than winter, because, if you're like me, your skin tends to be a little more sensitive/dry in the winter. On sensitive skin, this mask can feel a little harsh. A mild burning discomfort. It can leave my face quite red and irritated after rinsing it off."

I was told that for a $5 shipping fee I could request some samples (I requested 4 and they sent me 6!). The customer service was OUTSTANDING! One of my samples broke while in transit bc of the below zero temps so I called to request another and they promptly overnighted a very, very generous sample size! This mask is super lightweight and translucent. I expected it to be drying on my sensitive fair skin but it was very gentle and left my skin soft and with a brightness that I didn't have 30 mins before. My husband even noticed! Based upon my experience with the products and the fantastic customer service, I will without a doubt be purchasing from TaTa Harper in the future!!"

I had a $20 discount from sephora, which put it in the more reasonable $30 range, and that is probably the most I would be willing to pay for it. I like it, it does give me a glow, but its not a miracle product and its a pretty small jar.  However, I think it will probably last a while, I don't need very much. I think it smells nice, not artificial at all. Also, I think more consistent, continued use would show the best results. (As with all beauty products, ha!)  Its one of the only product lines sephora sells that has completely natural, food grade ingredients, and it is a very good brand with products that actually work, they're just on the pricey side."

My t-zone is pretty oily, but I'm not acne-prone. I usually have one random pimple every few months, but occasionally suffer from breakouts. I have blackheads on my nose. I have redness on and around my nose.  This mask goes a long way. It feels good when you put it on. It smells nice. The smell goes away when you wash it off. It tightens your skin. It brightened my skin. It reduced redness on and around my nose. It kept my face shine-free for about three days, so I'd recommend it as a twice a week mask for 30 minutes, depending on how sensitive your skin is."

I find it is quite gentle and unlike some other resurfacing masks I don't feel like it's burning off a layer of skin but rather it gently gets the job done. Your skin feels fresh, bright, and renewed after having used it. However, if you like or need masks that give you that burning/tingling feeling (for example, GlamGlow) then you may not like this one. As far as I'm concerned, if it works I would much rather go without the burning sensation and abrasiveness of other masks. Also, the Tata Harper line is the only one on Sephora with truly green/natural/clean ingredients if that is something you're at all interested in."

This mask exfoliates my skin, making it easier for me to reach any acne for farther cleaning. My skin is baby soft for at least three to four days after I use the mask and looks incredible!  I often use the mask once a week, twice if it is a bad week. I have been using less and less of the mask each time, careful to apply only to my t-zone in hopes the jar will las longer."

I liked that it had natural ingredients and seemed gentle (though some people react to natural ingredients, too.) I felt like it was comfortable on my skin, though it does have witch hazel in it which made my eyes feel a bit watery for a minute or two.  It definitely temporarily tightens the skin (probably again due to the witch hazel) but nothing is going to actually shrink pores. It may temporarily make them appear smaller, which is as good as it gets. But in terms of realism in cosmetic treatments, that's important to note. That said, it does a good job at temporarily tightening the surface of the skin and making it look even and radiant.  Sometimes with masks, I can get a bit red or pink after, but this one just left my skin very glowing and moisturized.  Bottom line: I'd definitely recommend this, despite the somewhat prohibitive cost. If you're realistic about the short term effects vs anything permanent or long lasting, then I think you'll likely benefit and enjoy using it."

			"review_text": "I've liked most of the Tata Harper products that I've tried and this one is my current favorite product. Ever. Not just out of what I've tried from the line but out of every product I've ever tried. It does exactly what it says: my complexion really looks refreshed (even when I'm beyond tired) and positively glows after using this mask. It's an exfoliant and treatment mask in one so no need for that extra step of a physical or enzymatic scrub before applying the Resurfacing Mask. I just do a once over with my cleanser to wash my makeup, sunscreen, etc. off my face, pat dry and then apply this directly. Easy and fuss free. It has the faintest of calming scents, slightly green and sweet (honeysuckle?) but the scent is so mild it wouldn't offend anyone sensitive to smell (like me). The consistency is, as one reviewer called it, a bit 'soapy' like a watery gelatin so it is easy to apply too much. You really only need a light coating across the face. Inevitably, you'll reach in and pull out globs so keep in mind that you'll most likely need less than you anticipate. Rather than filling my palm, I spread it on my face bit by bit so none of this precious mask goes to waste. It's excellent value too. The jar may look small but you only need a little each time. It's a very pretty pink color, like a gemstone, but fear not, your face will not look pink either during or after. The gelatinous texture has the added benefit of defusing the color as it's thinned out and spread across the face. It tightens on the skin as it dries but never stings, itches or is in any way uncomfortable. It washes off easily with a bit of water and cleanser and the result is instant luminosity. My skin literally glows after I use this mask, which I love. It also makes the texture of my skin noticeably smoother to the touch and any product that I use after seems to have a more pronounced effect. TIP: Because this is so effective at removing any material clogging the skin's surface, it's the perfect product to use once or twice a week before applying a serum that promises action packed results. I save my most complex (and delicate) serums for nights that I pre-treat with this mask. Just be careful not to use anything that might irritate your skin after the Resurfacing Mask (like AHAs or retinol) if you are sensitive. I love that the ingredients of this product are all natural and I don't need to worry about what any chemical nasties may do to my body over time. I also love that Tata Harper has thoughtfully packaged this in glass that is both environmentally friendly (reuse or recycle it!) and sturdy enough to withstand traveling and the occasional tumble from counter to bathroom floor. This is a wonderful product, a winner all around, and I couldn't recommend it highly enough!"
