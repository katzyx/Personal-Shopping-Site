My makeup will stay looking fresh through an entire work day with a dewy, but not overly shiny, finish. I have really dry skin so I couldn't ask for better.   I would definitely recommend starting with the trial size. I tried the primer with a lot of products (including ones Beauty YouTubers recommend it with) before I found my match.

The cream absorbs so easily into my skin and gave my dry Winter texture a smooth, hydrated feel. I cannot say enough about the way my face looked and felt, and I’m a huge fan of beauty products that multi-task. This can be used as a primer under makeup, or just as a moisturizer to create a barrier against impurities. It has vitamins for nourishment, Shea Butter, and Hyaluronic Acid. My only issue with this product is that I felt the scent was a bit much while applying. It almost has a hint of citronella to me, but the scent didn’t seem to last too long once it was on. I am very sensitive to smells, and the fact that this cream provided amazing results with my face, I will continue using it."

That much scent for a facial moisturizer is just unnecessary.  It works as a makeup base - but not very well on my dry skin.

One of the things I love most about this face base is how well it absorbs into my skin. It instantly sinks in without leaving any greasy or sticky residue behind.

But the real standout feature of this product is the smell. It has a beautiful, refreshing scent that is not overwhelming or artificial. Applying it in the morning is like a mini aromatherapy session, giving me a burst of energy and starting my day off on a positive note.  I have also noticed that my skin looks brighter and more radiant since I started using the Bobbi Brown Face Base. Its formula is enriched with vitamins and antioxidants that help nourish and protect my skin. And as someone with sensitive skin, I appreciate that it is free from parabens and sulfates.  In conclusion, the Bobbi Brown Face Base has truly exceeded my expectations and I cannot imagine my skincare routine without it.

As a result, my foundation has been looking patchy, making it difficult to wear. That's why I was excited to try this innovative skincare-made-for-makeup face primer. The key ingredient in it is shea butter, which makes it feel rich and creamy as you work it in. Although the primer is expensive, I only need a tiny amount to cover my entire face. Immediately after using it, my skin felt hydrated and smooth. After a week of using it regularly, I noticed a significant improvement in my skin and how my foundation looked. I even found myself using it without applying makeup and it made my skin feel hydrated, glowy, and soft. This primer has been a lifesaver for my aging skin and I will purchase it again and again!"

			"review_text": "I have normal-to-(very) dry skin. As someone who masks often, uses a retinoid, and experiences allergic rhinitis on a daily basis, I find that I am no stranger to flaky skin around my t-zone area (especially around my mouth), making it almost impossible for me to apply makeup due to it merely emphasizing the flaky dryness of my skin. Out of all the primers I've tried, this is the best primer at moisturizing and smoothing out the texture of my skin! (I still use a separate moisturizer underneath though.) It can sting to apply this if your skin is sensitized, so be warned, but no other primer has made my cheaper makeup look and apply so well. I feel that I don't need to use a whole lot of product to get the best result, so each jar lasts me awhile.  I recommend purchasing the trial size before committing to a full jar. My trial size has lasted me a good 2 yrs since I rarely wear makeup, but I find that when I don't use this primer, my makeup doesn't look nearly as good. Keep in mind that if your skin is peeling excessively (as in, the primer doesn't work as well at masking the flakes), consider first that you may be overexfoliating. Monitor your skincare, and this primer will treat you well."

Especially now that I am 46 and my skin is very dry due to peri menopause and this adds a glow to my skin that allows my foundation to look like skin and not sit in every pore, fine line or bit of texture. I am usually anti base product because of the typical ingredients but this has none of the bad stuff that feels like you have plastic sitting on your face. This is actually skincare feeding your skin. It plays well with both my SPF and my stick foundation that had been looking chalky and dry until this plumped up my skin and made it look healthy and feel soft. I was worried it would be too thick and not work with my spf but so far it’s great. I have mostly used with a foundation stick and face tint so I still have to experiment with liquid and cream foundation but I am very happy with it so far!"

Before trying face base, I didn’t use primers because I hadn’t found one that actually made a noticeable difference in the application and longevity of my foundation. The Bobbi Brown face base has been an absolute game changer. I applied the face base, let it soak in for about minutes and then applied my foundation. I was shocked at how smooth and even my foundation looked. At the end of the night, my face looked slightly oily but still much better than any other primer I’ve tried. I also love that it has ingredients that are actually good for your skin!"

This stuff hydrates my skin, making it a smooth canvas for makeup. It's light and doesn't make me feel oily, plus it has a nice subtle scent that feels fancy. Even when I'm not wearing much makeup, it gives a natural, dewy glow. It's a bit pricey, but for the quality and how long it lasts, I think it's worth the splurge."

I like a more natural look so I usually mix a foundation or glow product with my moisturizer. It keeps my make up looking great all day long. I even wore it overnight and noticed my blemishes were clearing up faster than usual. My ONLY complaint is the smell. It’s not bad, not great but it does have a very distinct smell - kind of lemony? Don’t quote me but the smell is definitely there, HOWEVER - it does go away so you aren’t smelling it all day long."

			"review_text": "I have been using this product for 10 YEARS!! When I tell you this is the one product I absolutely cannot live without, I mean it. It makes your makeup go on SO smooth and truly extends the wear. Stay tuned for an application tip below that helps you get the most out of this product.   I have combination / dry skin and this product is super hydrating without any oiliness, but you’ll of course want to prep your skin before applying. I would recommend pairing this with at least a vitamin C serum and some type of hyaluronic acid (goes great over PCA hyaluronic acid boosting serum!!). But even my friends and family who have oily skin love this product. I really think it works for all skin types.   I have tried every product under the sun—all the YouTube / Instagram / TikTok viral products and notorious “best sellers” (yes I’m easily influenced)—I ALWAYS come back to this product. I refuse to do my makeup without it. Even when I’m traveling, I’ll make a special trip to grab this if I accidentally forget it or run out.    APPLICATION TIP: When applying, don’t try to rub it into your skin really well. Put another way, don’t massage it into your skin. Instead, use two fingers to gently press a small amount into the skin and do this all over the face. As you’re gently pressing into the skin, you’ll want to press upwards slightly, especially around the under eye area. I call it the “tap tap tap” process. It takes a little more time to apply but I really think this application style makes all the difference with smoothing out your skin / pores. And make sure to wait at least one minute before applying sunscreen or any other product!

I applied just a pea sized dollop to my face, and it blurred my pores and gave me a beautifully natural look before I ever applied any makeup. And when I DID apply my makeup, it acted as a fantastic primer. My makeup stayed put all evening, and I felt moisturized and comfortable throughout."

This primer is truly a game-changer. First and foremost, the texture is heavenly. It feels lightweight and silky, gliding effortlessly onto my skin. The moment I apply it, I can feel an instant surge of hydration. My skin drinks up the goodness of the Shea Butter, leaving it supple and moisturized throughout the day. What sets this face base apart is its ability to double as a skincare product. The infusion of Vitamins B, C, and E not only provides a much-needed antioxidant boost but also works wonders in revitalizing my complexion. I've noticed a visible reduction in the appearance of fine lines, and my skin looks more radiant and healthy. When it comes to makeup application, the Face Base is a dream. It creates a smooth canvas, allowing my foundation to glide on effortlessly. My makeup stays in place for hours without creasing or fading. The subtle Grapefruit and Geranium fragrance adds a refreshing touch, uplifting my senses. Overall, the Bobbi Brown Vitamin Enriched Face Base has earned its spot in my beauty routine. It's a skincare primer hybrid that delivers on its promises. My skin feels nourished, my makeup looks flawless, and I feel confident knowing I'm giving my skin the care it deserves. I highly recommend giving this product a try!"

I’ve noticed that my makeup lasts longer and looks more flawless when I use this as a base. Another standout feature is the subtle scent of the product. It has a pleasant, fresh fragrance that adds to the overall sensorial experience without being overpowering. I appreciate that the scent is not too strong, as it can be off-putting for some people. The packaging is sleek and convenient, with a sturdy jar that is easy to travel with.

The first time I used it, my skin stung a bit. (At this point I should have washed it off) but I continued with my makeup routine. The next day I used it again. BIG MISTAKE. My skin burned and foolishly I didn't wash it off but continued with my makeup. By evening I had full-blown severe contact dermatitis. My face is bright red and extremely irritated. I suspect it's the strong citrus fragrance in the product that did this. So BEWARE if using a retinol product - even if your skin is acclimated to the retinol - this face base will cause a burn and irritation like no other."

I was anxious to see how it would play with my typical powder foundation routine and it didn't disappoint! I let it sink in for a few minutes so that my skin felt moisturized but not tacky and then applied my concealer/foundation. Both products went on great and didn't cling weirdly or bunch up. It truly is a great base for makeup. I haven't used a primer much after loving how my makeup looks more with just moisturizer underneath but this gave me the best of both worlds. I feel like I got a nice smooth base but also super hydrated skin. I also love that it has a skincare aspect to it also so that I get the short term effect of my makeup going on smooth and also the long term skin-loving ingredients. A little goes a long way also!

After trying this out for almost 2 weeks, I would say for me personally that this moisturizer works well as a night cream, however during the day (even on my dry skin) it looks a bit too shiny/greasy for my own personal liking. I prefer a semi-matte look though, so if you’re someone who prefers a more dewy looks + has dry skin, this may be perfect for you. I can’t imagine how it would look on more oily skin types though (I’m guessing greasy, however I can’t fully comment on that).   The fragrance is ok, although I would like it more if it was fragrance-free. All in all, I’d give this a 3/5 simply because I have other night creams I prefer more + this looks too dewy/shiny on my face during the day. I am giving it 4/5 on this review however because it makes an EXCELLENT hand/cuticle cream!!"

It’s a beautiful combo of moisturizer & primer while giving your skin an extra boost of nourishment & balance for an exceptional smooth canvas for your makeup applications. I’m able to use it on a variety of client skin types and textures & little goes a long way. I Have openly recommended this product for years & it hasn’t changed today!"

It is light weight yet ultra moisturizing on the skin but not greasy! It has all the amazing vitamins my skin needs especially right now that I am entering my 30’s and need all the skin plumping products! The scent is so light which is a plus! I tend to have oily skin so I really love how radiant this makes my skin look but never oily. Definitely a must have and must repurchase."
