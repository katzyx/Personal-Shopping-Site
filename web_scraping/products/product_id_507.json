I have been using it for about 2 and a half weeks. 2 weeks it was okk, I liked the texture but beside that nothing much. However from last couple of days my skin has been sooo dry and burning. I have having hard time pin point what’s going on. I kinda had feel that it was this moisture and tonight it’s confirmed, as soon as I put is moisture on tonight MY SKIM BURNED LIKE IT WAS ON FIRE!!! This moisture only thing that was changed my skincare routine. It has completely damaged my skin barrier, I have so much dullness, redness, rash like little bumps and actually pain on my cheeks, upper lip and forehead. I’m scared that I have discoloration from this now and I been taking care of my skin forever!"

HOWEVER, in the last 6ish months, my face started to burn when applying this, despite no change in my routine at all. I would end up with red, flaky almost-blisters on my eyelids, under my eyes, and around my nose if any of the cream got on there. I looked into it, and this has eucalyptus oil in it, which over time will break down your skin barrier, and once that's gone, will irritate the hell out of your skin. If I could go back I would maybe look at only applying it once a day, not as a morning and evening moisturizer, or if you already have sensitive skin, this is not as soothing as you might like."

Even piling it on doesn’t work. I’m sure this would be a fine for the rest of the year, but this is doing absolutely nothing for me in this dry winter weather when I need it the most."

FAB ultra repair cream has been my go-to product for years, and I always come back to this one after trying new moisturizers. It provides me with enough hydration and helps me with redness significantly; my skin has also become less sensitive over the years (I experienced less frequent breakouts).  However, the formula change has completely ruined this product! The last time I bought this, it made me break out like crazy; it caused severe redness and burning all over my skin, and my skin still burns when I use other moisturizers that don't make me break out. I looked up the ingredient lists. They added eucalyptus oil extract, which can irritate sensitive skin. FAB please fix the formula and make it sensitive skin safe since the brand is advised for people with sensitive skin."

I apply the cream as my last step and every morning, when I wake up and I feel my face, my skin is so soft and smooth. Compared to my previous moisturizer, my skin feels different—in a positive way! Every skin type is different so this may not work for you. I have normal-to dry skin, and prior to putting this on I also put on toner and two serums. So those factors may change your own outcome. I know this is a very long review, but personally, I would want a review that reflects a truthful opinion on a product! Thank you First Aid Beauty!"

It does not have a nice light wet texture like a good facial moisturizer should. 2. does not dissolve into the skin but rather feels like a heavy film once on. 3. smells like a drugstore product. 4. feels like a body lotion and NOT a something to be applied to the face. 5. the price, what?? I dont have sensitive or special requirements for my skin and I'm not one that is particularly picky with my skin care, but I dont understand how this can work for anyone. It may be ok if you've never tried other moisturizing products to compare, but out of all the sephora moisturizers I have tried, this falls at the last of my list. I think it could work as a body moisturizer but certainly not for the face."

I think my skin is just really sensitive to essential oils so this moisturizer isn't compatible with my face.

It is great lotion, it did wonders for my dry winter skin, I have little dry rough patches on my arms in the winter and this soothed them. I’m giving it 4 stars because it’s fantastic but you lose a star because $50 for body lotion is insane."
