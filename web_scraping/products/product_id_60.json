I've been a loyal NARS foundation user for years, but it's not been looking great on me lately. It's too orangey & I can't seem to find a good shade. I saw a tutorial about trying to find the right shade, and she said this was easy to match. It does have a bit of a medicinal smell at first, but my smell is ridiculously good, so others might not notice it. It's not bad at all, though, and dissipates quickly after application. I use a very small amount because I just need light coverage. I'm so happy I gave this a shot. Even though it's pricey, it's worth it. My picture was taken after a day of wear. I always rub some off around my mouth when I eat. So, it's not the best picture. but very natural and light feeling."

However I did prep my skin more and tried Mac fix plus under my makeup this time. This does not oxidize how the Dior Air Flash would which is great. I wanted to cover up redness on my face so I first applied with a sigma flat head brush then blending out with a beauty blender. I used MDSolarSciences sunscreen underneath. I wore at thanksgiving so it did wear around my chin some but was not noticeable. I was a little shiny in my T zone (I have normal to dry skin) but powder fixed it right up. I used Charlotte Tilbury airbrush flawless setting powder and Fenty Pro Filtu2019r soft matte longware powder foundation. Spayed Mac fix plus all over and pressed in with a beauty blender. No concealer. I did set my foundation under my eyes quickly to help reduce creasing. Did crease as much as other foundation and skin tints Iu2019ve tried. I multiple compliments on my u201ccomplexionu201d. I wear the lightest shade in just about everything and fair neutral worked well for me. Iu2019d say go for it! Itu2019s expensive but did not disappoint!"

I don't know why I didn't try this foundation before, I guess the words Luminous and Glow in the name put me off.  But this is not true at all. Foundation goes on beautifully and can be manipulated from very light to a good medium coverage. It lays nicely around the eyes and often replaces my concealer. What struck me is that foundation is self matted during fixation. But at the same time, it does not tighten my skin in a strange way and lies almost untraceable in areas with wide pores.  It's not shiny and greasy, it looks like your skin but better. Lies perfectly from morning to late night. Unless I'm planning a long day, I don't use powder with it. If I know I need my makeup to last for 8+ hours, then I go lightly with loose powder and use blotting paper only if it's too hot outside. All in all, it's a great product that I'm very happy with and that fills a lot of my needs. Absolutely recommend it!"

If my skin is recovering from a breakout, on the other hand, it shows every little bump and area of texture.   I like that it dries down and sets on the face rather than moves around all day unlike some of the other medium coverage, radiant/natural foundations out there. Overall, I canu2019t see myself buying a full size version of this at full price, but if itu2019s your HG and a price point youu2019re comfortable with, I can see the appeal for sure."

To me, the coverage looks more light than medium. It feels very comfortable on the skin, like I'm not wearing anything, but each time I saw myself in the mirror throughout the workday, my skin looked so pretty. I have combination skin and did have to apply a little powder to my T-zone a couple to times in the afternoon, which I would have to do with any foundation. I also have worn this foundation with Revision Tinted moisturizer with SPF underneath, and it worked well.

Based on the online color match, shade 2.0 fair peach was the recommendation.  The color was way off and made my skin appear chalky.  I went into Sephora to get matched by a sales person and after the facial scan, 2.0 was still the recommended color. however both the kind sales person and I agreed it was way too light for my complexion, we experimented with other colors and my ideal match ended up being 4.5 light to medium neutral!  This is not a foundation youu2019ll want to order online because the color names do not match the actual foundation and the lowest number does not necessarily mean lightest.   In other words, this is a product to buy in store if itu2019s your first time using.  One more recommendation- the Armani primer does not work well with this product.  It causes the foundation to separate on your face.  I found makeup forever pore minimizer primer layered beautifully with Armani luminous silk or simply stick to an oil free primer.  Hopefully this review saves someone from the inconvenience of having to return."

Also, no matter how much setting powder I use, my T-zone will eventually get oily and I get oily around my nose. The first time I used this foundation, I used less setting powder because I noticed my skin looked cakey with more powder, but I did not get as oily as I usually do which is a nice surprise. All in all, really like this foundation, but given the price point and the amount I have to use to cover my acne and scarring, not sure I would purchase again. Also, just an FYI, I would recommend trying this foundation on using the Armani website, for some reason the Sephora IQ match for this foundation was off by several shades but I checked on the Armani website and used the shade they recommended and it was correct!"

I know it says oil free, but I am not sure if this would be great on oily skin. I looked like a glowing goddess all day, but going to be honest with you, there were a few times thru the day I was worried if the glow might appear to be sweaty rather than glowy....so I think someone with more oily skin might feel even more so.

Tried 4.5 Light to Medium Neutral, but definitely too dark. Tried 4.25 Light with Peachy Undertone, but although the shade is neither too light nor too dark, it's too peachy. What's my next option? Will 4 Light Golden be too yellow? The next shades up get into the Fair and Very Fair tones, golden, pink, olive, golden... do I just go straight to 1.5 Fair Neutral? Or will that be way too pale? The Armani Luminous Silk numbering system seems oddly complicated. Can't decide whether 3 stars because at least the texture and finish are gorgeous, or just 2 because texture/finish means nothing without the right shade, and I'm frustrated because I can't just exchange what I have on account my options are sold out after the Spring Sale. (Decision: 3 stars because I hope at some point to find my shade, despite the complications of living too far from a counter. And I'd recommend it if you can find your shade.)"

The texture is so lightweight, the color matches my skin perfectly, and its coverage is light to medium (closer to medium).  I have pretty good skin overall so I do need to cover much but I need to cover my blackheads and pores and want to have an even skin tone. This does all that pretty well. And it stays on for hours even though my T zone gets a bit oily after a few hours. If your skin is very oily it might not work perfectly for you but if your skin is anything like mine (combination) I think you may like it :)"

Both of those melt into my skin and look really natural but I get more bang for my buck. I will use this for my summer shade when I want less coverage  but more than a tinted moisturizer.
