I've been a loyal NARS foundation user for years, but it's not been looking great on me lately. It's too orangey & I can't seem to find a good shade. I saw a tutorial about trying to find the right shade, and she said this was easy to match. It does have a bit of a medicinal smell at first, but my smell is ridiculously good, so others might not notice it. It's not bad at all, though, and dissipates quickly after application. I use a very small amount because I just need light coverage. I'm so happy I gave this a shot. Even though it's pricey, it's worth it. My picture was taken after a day of wear. I always rub some off around my mouth when I eat. So, it's not the best picture. but very natural and light feeling."

However I did prep my skin more and tried Mac fix plus under my makeup this time. This does not oxidize how the Dior Air Flash would which is great. I wanted to cover up redness on my face so I first applied with a sigma flat head brush then blending out with a beauty blender. I used MDSolarSciences sunscreen underneath. I wore at thanksgiving so it did wear around my chin some but was not noticeable. I was a little shiny in my T zone (I have normal to dry skin) but powder fixed it right up. I used Charlotte Tilbury airbrush flawless setting powder and Fenty Pro Filt’r soft matte longware powder foundation. Spayed Mac fix plus all over and pressed in with a beauty blender. No concealer. I did set my foundation under my eyes quickly to help reduce creasing. Did crease as much as other foundation and skin tints I’ve tried. I multiple compliments on my “complexion”. I wear the lightest shade in just about everything and fair neutral worked well for me. I’d say go for it! It’s expensive but did not disappoint!"

The foundation itself is a very thin consistency, which makes sense since it’s oil free. If you’re thinking to buy this, do it! Even for my dry skin people, this does not disappoint! It sits very beautifully on the skin, does not feel drying at all, but gives a smooth glowy matte finish! Does not crease or settle into fine lines!

I have normal skin with combined areas on my nose and chin, and I also have large pores on and around my nose. I am 33 years old and have some deep wrinkles around my nose and tiny ones around eyes. I don't know why I didn't try this foundation before, I guess the words Luminous and Glow in the name put me off.  But this is not true at all. Foundation goes on beautifully and can be manipulated from very light to a good medium coverage. It lays nicely around the eyes and often replaces my concealer. What struck me is that foundation is self matted during fixation. But at the same time, it does not tighten my skin in a strange way and lies almost untraceable in areas with wide pores.  It's not shiny and greasy, it looks like your skin but better. Lies perfectly from morning to late night. Unless I'm planning a long day, I don't use powder with it. If I know I need my makeup to last for 8+ hours, then I go lightly with loose powder and use blotting paper only if it's too hot outside. All in all, it's a great product that I'm very happy with and that fills a lot of my needs. Absolutely recommend it!"

If my skin is recovering from a breakout, on the other hand, it shows every little bump and area of texture.   I like that it dries down and sets on the face rather than moves around all day unlike some of the other medium coverage, radiant/natural foundations out there.

I went into Sephora to get matched by a sales person and after the facial scan, 2.0 was still the recommended color. however both the kind sales person and I agreed it was way too light for my complexion, we experimented with other colors and my ideal match ended up being 4.5 light to medium neutral!  This is not a foundation you’ll want to order online because the color names do not match the actual foundation and the lowest number does not necessarily mean lightest.   In other words, this is a product to buy in store if it’s your first time using.  One more recommendation- the Armani primer does not work well with this product.  It causes the foundation to separate on your face.  I found makeup forever pore minimizer primer layered beautifully with Armani luminous silk or simply stick to an oil free primer.

Also, no matter how much setting powder I use, my T-zone will eventually get oily and I get oily around my nose. The first time I used this foundation, I used less setting powder because I noticed my skin looked cakey with more powder, but I did not get as oily as I usually do which is a nice surprise. All in all, really like this foundation, but given the price point and the amount I have to use to cover my acne and scarring, not sure I would purchase again.

I typically use a highligher, but with the glow i felt it would be too much (if there is such a thing??).  You can feel that there is clearly skincare in it too.   I know it says oil free, but I am not sure if this would be great on oily skin. I looked like a glowing goddess all day, but going to be honest with you, there were a few times thru the day I was worried if the glow might appear to be sweaty rather than glowy....so I think someone with more oily skin might feel even more so.  Those of you with dry skin, this would make you feel nourished for sure!"

Tried 4.5 Light to Medium Neutral, but definitely too dark. Tried 4.25 Light with Peachy Undertone, but although the shade is neither too light nor too dark, it's too peachy. What's my next option? Will 4 Light Golden be too yellow? The next shades up get into the Fair and Very Fair tones, golden, pink, olive, golden... do I just go straight to 1.5 Fair Neutral? Or will that be way too pale? The Armani Luminous Silk numbering system seems oddly complicated. Can't decide whether 3 stars because at least the texture and finish are gorgeous, or just 2 because texture/finish means nothing without the right shade, and I'm frustrated because I can't just exchange what I have on account my options are sold out after the Spring Sale. (Decision: 3 stars because I hope at some point to find my shade, despite the complications of living too far from a counter. And I'd recommend it if you can find your shade.)"

I’m personally someone who doesn’t care about the brand and have loved many products from the drugstore too, but I love this foundation! The texture is so lightweight, the color matches my skin perfectly, and its coverage is light to medium (closer to medium).  I have pretty good skin overall so I do need to cover much but I need to cover my blackheads and pores and want to have an even skin tone. This does all that pretty well. And it stays on for hours even though my T zone gets a bit oily after a few hours.
