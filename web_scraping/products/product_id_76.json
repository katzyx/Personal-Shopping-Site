			"review_text": "This foundation has been a staple for years and years and serves a specific function that my other foundations can't. If you want to go the more natural route and use a mineral sunscreen, like a stick balm for example, they are usually whitish in tone and sticky. This foundation is the PERFECT solution over top! Actually to any sunscreen where you can't layer a liquid foundation over it or it will be a thick oil slick sliding around... This powder mineral foundation goes over sunscreen like a dream and melts right in for a beautiful finish! The sunscreen acts like a great primer with this foundation. You'll still need to use a setting powder on top as this foundation is creamy and doesn't suck up oil, unless you go with the matte version it might a little, but I always find I need a finishing powder over this powder foundation. I like the original better than the matte because I don't have an excessive oil problem and the barely there slight shimmer (not really a shimmer just a slight skin-like glow) looks more skin-like. I tend to mainly use it in the summer when I'm in the sun more, but this foundation also works as a touch-up blurring powder when at the end of the day or mid day your liquid foundation has broken up. It also works as a bedtime foundation where you can't bear to look bad with your guy and need something on that healing zit that won't clog it. A light dab of this is awesome for it's mineral clean ingredients that help the healing, not hinder it. Also this foundation won't spoil in a year like liquid foundations so it lasts forever which is great value if you rotate foundations like I do. I apply this with a very soft flat head brush in swirling motions.  A little goes a long way, if you over apply it will look bad, bring it down your neck onto your collar bone so it looks flawless-natural. For my skin tone being a light yellow-olive undertone, I'm blue-eyed, not asian, you might be surprised this is the perfect color."

My skin is fair, but since the fair and light were out of stock, I thought I would try the light to medium  shade. Surprisingly, it's extremely light on my skin. Too light in fact. As for how the finish looks on my skin, no amount of buffing works for me. I've tried with a primer, without a primer, different brushes, including the one from Bare Minerals, and all it does is settle in the pores and lines accentuating them. The more I buff, the worse it gets. I guess it's just not meant for me."

Why I haven't written a review on the thousands of products I have tried is beyond me, but I plan to start now because there is so much to share!  I have very dry, eczema prone skin.  I do not have a lot of scarring or pitting, and no concerns with acne.  I have tried any and every foundation you can name, and I will always come back to this.  You have to remember to have a good moisturizer and primer on beneath (which you have allowed to completely dry otherwise this will pill and build up).  I faithfully use the BM recommended brush.  Start with a little and build up slowly.    Like most products, if you don't know how to use this, it will look awful.  But if used correctly, there is nothing like this to give you that everyday, fresh, flawless, glowing skin.    The best part is that it is for both young and mature skin; there is nothing quite like this formula.  I am forever committed and will always come back to this as my mainstay."

It does not blend into the skin like the other one and somehow looked oily at the end of the day even though I have dry sensitive skin.

I was initially hesitant to buy it because I’m not a loose powder kind of person - I’m scared I’ll easily have a powder explosion and didn’t want to bother with that. But let’s face it, the reviews here are soo  good that I had to try it for the hype. First off, I tried this powder a decent number of times with various buffing brushes. The problem is the whole application process just isn’t worth the results imo. If I need coverage, I would have to swirl tap and buff a number of times to get the desired effect, because if I use too much at once, it looks powdery. Also, even at “full coverage”, this is at most the same as only one thin layer of a liquid product. So while it’s not bad, I just don’t think it’s worth it when I can easily achieve a similar and better result with other products with a much easier application process."

I'm a little older at 43, and even though I have very good skin, this still creases in my eye area and can crease in my nasolabial fold if I overdo it there.

When I applied this to my skin, it didn’t look natural, but with blending with their original brush ( the white brush with black stick), it gets better but takes quiet some time, which I don’t have that much time when I work. But as time goes, this foundation looks like my own skin but so much better. My husband took a close look and he didn’t know I had foundation on! Is that natural!  I returned the brush because first: it takes too long to blend it. 2nd: it gives medium coverage with that brush. 3 the handle is too big for my hands. But the foundation is the best foundation I’ve tried. I tried many big brand foundations but they all cause skin prob. This one is just the right one for me. I will stick to it.

It doesn't look like you have foundation on compared to a liquid one. If you are looking for something light (almost medium) that covers all the little imperfections, try it! It also works wonders under sunscreen in the summer as the sunscreen kinda act as a primer underneath. I found that the best brush to apply it with was the Tarte Airbrush Finish Bamboo Foundation. The Bare Minerals brush is in my opinion too soft for this powder. Since you have to press the brush on the face to apply, the little dry patch might show if your skin isn't clean and properly moisturized.

The formula is 10/10 in my opinion. The only problem is the crappy shade range for light skin tones. I have fair skin with a neutral-warm undertone and the lightest applicable shade, Fairly Light, is incredibly dark. I'm only able to use it for 3-4 months a year before it becomes way too dark for me to use. PLEASE MAKE LIGHTER SHADES! This shade range may have been acceptable when this product first was released but now with more brands catering to lighter skin tones, this limited range for pale skin just doesn't cut it anymore. With so many shades and undertones for darker skin tones, there's no reason there can't be some options for fair skin."

I was a little skeptical about the coverage capabilities being a powder. In all honesty, it provides only sheer coverage, similar to a light to medium coverage foundation. If you are looking for full coverage, use this as a setting powder over your concealer, and you will wonder why you never purchased this sooner! The texture has a subtle glow, and it does sort of a miracle job of somehow making your skin glow, while also mattifying. Thus, this product is excellent for combination skin. It is a great all-day foundation, doesn't cake, and application is so quick you can throw it on literally in seconds. It's a perfect quick fix in the morning or before running errands, when you're in a hurry, and does a great job of evening your skin tone and eliminating redness. Highly recommend!"

It has been a battle to find the perfect powder foundation but this one comes close. I just wish it lasted longer and wasn't so messy.

It smears all over my fingers and gets everywhere. Blotting sheets help but once it's gone all streaky there's nothing I can do other than completely wash it off, moisturize, prime and reapply. Also I've noticed even after priming (tried with too faced, hourglass, and smashbox) it will sometimes apply unevenly. If I can get it applied evenly, it looks amazing when fresh but it doesn't last for more than a couple hours. The search continues."

When I wash off cream foundations at the end of the day, it always seems like I have a new breakout. But with the BareMinerals foundation that doesn't happen.   The only thing I don't love about BareMinerals is the shade range. The lightest colour is just slightly darker and slightly yellower than my natural skin tone (despite that fact that Fair is described as having pink undertones). I wish they would come out with a more extensive shade range to match more people's complexions."

I would say it doesn't have a ton of resilience, like by the end of the day it's not quite there still, but to me that makes it easier to take off at night; I don't need a super performant makeup remover. I can also easily reapply it during the day with a brush if I need to."

Just grab a kabuki brush and it takes me less than a minute to apply my foundation flawlessly (no icky sponges or liquid foundation getting everywhere). A couple notes I've learned on how to fully appreciate this product:  1) Don't be deceived by the fact that it's a powder. It is not resistant to becoming oily/shiny. SO, you need to make sure you dab a bit of translucent powder (I use the Laura Mercier one) over your T-zone after you've applied BareMinerals. Then it stays flawless the whole day (longer than any other foundation I've tried).   2) I have extremely fair/pale skin but with neutral undertones, so the fairly light shade is the one I go with. If I apply a thin layer (which is all you need for medium-full coverage) it matches my skin tone perfectly. But when I first got it, I applied a thick layer and it ended up turning me too dark. So if you think the shade is too dark for you, just try applying less next time.   I don't think I'll ever go back to another foundation! This one makes me look and feel airbrushed without looking fake or cakey. I get compliments on my skin when I wear it!"

The oils that do seep through during the day help the foundation melt into the skin. I don't wear primer underneath, just prep my skin really well so it's nice and dewey. I'm quite lazy and don't bother with touch-ups (especially in the summer heat) and I noticed that the makeup was good for about 5 hours before it started to breakup. Blotting sheets would probably be super helpful at that point!  Not too sure if it's super buildable after the first application because I normally apply a light dusting and that's it.  Yes, you will feel this product on your skin! No, it's not a heavy, gross feeling!"

I'm in my mid thirties, have two kids and while I don't have 'wrinkles' I certainly have started to develop 'crinkles'. Plus having kids does weird things to like, every part of your body, including your skin. I wanted to love this as much as I did when I was young, but this is a product for young skin. It sat on my face in an uncomfortable way, made my crinkles crepe-y and oxidized after a few hours of wear. Thanks to Sephora's awesome return policy, I was able to return it."

You have to use a dense kabuki brush if you're looking for max (but not cakey) coverage. Circular buffing motions is the key to achieving the best finish. I was trained, many moons ago, on how to apply and it's honestly amazing if used correctly.

After about 6-8 hours the foundation starts to look a little oily and somewhat settles into the lines around my mouth but I just use my foundation brush to buff or lightly tap my whole face, which makes it look perfect again. I use the hourglass vanish foundation brush- which works very well with liquid, stick and powder foundation.This foundation lasts longer and looks better than any other I have tried (I've tried ALOT of different brands). I also have acne and scars- this foundation covers up acne and redness VERY well, when I have scarring I apply an extra layer all over my face. I have a fair-light skin tone with olive undertones- or so I've been told.. If I don't have a lot of acne or scarring I apply a small amount of the foundation evenly over my face and the lightest shade matches my skin pretty well, increasing the amount of foundation I put on my face makes the foundation appear darker but it still never appears orangey. Moisturizing is a must before I put on this makeup, if I don't it makes my whole face look dry. The more primer I use the longer it looks perfect. I will definitely keep using this product. I highly recommend this product to people of all skin types, I suggest going into the store to test the shade on yourself- it looks darker in container then appears on face."

I've tested this many times in oceans and pools it only comes off with soap. I mean it fades a bit sure but nothing drastic whatsoever. It can go from practically translucent powder to full coverage the more you layer. And as long as I add some Laura Mercier Orgasm blush it looks hella natural. (As natural as I can get with acne scarred skin). The downside is the annoying messy packaging. It always send powder everywhere especially into my makeup bag and drives me nutso.

I can wear Fair, but it ends up looking a bit orangey and tanned. I have to blend out my neck, or it looks like I applied gradual tanner only on my face.   It can also be a tad drying, especially on those of us with already dry skin. I recommend heavily moisturising (creams and / or oils work beautifully) 10+ minutes before you start your makeup routine, and using some kind of chemical exfoliant 2+ times per week - as well as sunscreen every day. I use salicylic acid (2% - The Original - super inexpensive brand) and lactic acid (10% - The Original), and it helps prevent flakey, scaly patches of skin that grab onto the pigments. (Sidenote: AHAs and BHAs need to be around a pH of 3-4, so do not apply anything else for at least 20 min after these, as it will likely increase the pH and cause them to deactivate).   I also have extremely sensitive skin, and this hasn't caused any adverse reactions after months of wear. I was pleasantly surprised by this, but others may have different experiences with it.   Besides that, this is the best foundation I've found for easy, everyday usage. It is light to medium coverage, and buildable, to an extent. When applied lightly, with a buffing brush, it looks like your skin but better. It's not really obvious that you're wearing foundation, which is hugely appreciated. It is also the quickest and easiest to apply for a no-makeup makeup look, or when you want to downplay the face makeup in order to do crazy eye and / or lip looks.  Overall, great foundation for those looking for a light to medium coverage, easy to use foundation! Not so great for skintone extremes, though. :P  Sorry for the essay!"

Also I personally find it can look chalky at times, or the opposite, it can developed a odd sheen that looks very unnatural but not luminous??  I've switched back to using liquid foundations in the last year and feel that I prefer them over the bare minerals once again.  On the flip side if I want my makeup to last all day I have applied this over my liquid foundation once its dried down and it sets it nicely with out being chalky.

If you just tap it onto your skin, it won't look like it did anything. I do small, gentle circular motions around my face with a fluffy face brush and that's when it really looks like it melted in and covered things (it can be light, medium or even medium-full coverage). The shade is a pain to find. You can't just swatch it on your hand because they all look gray and ashy. You have to go with the model's pictures and get a few shades and try them on your face. It sucks because you have to return the ones that dont match. I wish bare minerals had good testers so we could be less wasteful. But finding your right shade is key to making this product work. **I found that I needed to go darker than I thought and even though I'm warm toned, a cool toned shade matched me best (for reference, I am NC42 and medium tan, golden tan and tan nude all work for my skin tone--with tan nude being slightly light). I also found that nearby shades looked identical on me. I also apply a setting spray to really get the product to melt with my skin. If you follow these tips, the foundation looks so natural, smooth and buttery. It's also so much better for your skin than other foundations and lasts a decently long time. Best of all, I find that it doesn't break up and look patchy after a long day and/or sweat"

Overall, it is nice.  I'll continue to use it mostly for travel, but it's not my most favorite foundation of all time.  It does tend to make me look somewhat shiny.  Which is weird because I have very dry skin.  Usually make skin looks too matte and cakey.  So for my dry skin sisters/brothers, this is a good powder foundation to try without the fear of it drying you out.  You may want to invest in a matte setting powder though because it can look too shiney in places.  It's a good problem for us dry people to have."

I have rosacea and my skin reacts well to this product. It doesn't cover all the redness but still does a good job. Even though it's a powder, it leaves your skin with a little bit of a dewy finish, but very natural. Be careful not to apply too much. Overall a great product, looks very natural and makes you feel as you're not wearing anything."

I've tried many different foundations over the years, from pressed powder to tinted moisturizer to liquid high end brands; but always end up coming back to this classic Foundation. The light weight feel, buildable application, and range of color are what make this Foundation worth every penny. Also to mention I have fairly sensitive skin and this is one that doesn't make me break out! I usually go for the deluxe size when it comes out around the holidays, and will use it to refill my original for traveling. If you're debating on trying it out, definitely do.

I'm used to having to touch up or re-apply if I'm going somewhere after work, especially in the summer.   I'm a makeup minimalist most days - foundation applied with the fingers, a swipe of blush & mascara, and concealer if needed, usually applied in a rush in my car. Naturally, I've avoided powder foundations because of the messiness/time factor but after hearing so many people talk about this foundation I had to finally try it.   WOW. At first I was confused because I thought I wasn't getting any makeup on my face. I'd buff it in and see nothing. But then I pulled my hand away and looked in the mirror and my skin just looked AWESOME. The makeup just becomes undetectable.   It easily covers my redness, keeps most of my oily spots in check, is long-wearing, and takes years off my face. Coverage is completely buildable. The hassle of having to apply with a brush and deal with powder is totally 100% worth it. I haven't used it long enough to see if it actually improves my skin over time, but I'm pretty confident it will considering it's performance so far!   I accidentally bought the wrong shade online and would definitely recommend visiting the makeup counter or Sephora to find the correct shade.   Note: I originally bought the bareMinerals liquid serum foundation thinking it'd be more my speed but it was NOT for me. Difficult to apply, greasy, and came off WAY too easily..  Another note: I bought the Perfecting Face Brush to go with the liquid foundation but found it to be great for the powder formula as well. I found the recommended Beautiful Finish brush to be way too large (although very soft and seemingly fun to use)."

At age 23 my skin took a major turn for the worse after going off birth control. I'd never had any skin issues before BC and during - besides minor break outs and hyper-pigmentation (redness) on my nose. At 24 I opted to only wear make up on special occasions thinking my skin was not fairing well due to make up. From 24 until about 6 months ago (I am 27) I have been on a very strict skincare regime in order to improve my skin (it has helped a lot, but there's a bit more to be done) as well as tried 20 or more different foundations looking for my Holy Grail. 6 months ago I thought back to make up I had been using when I had perfect skin - this bare minerals foundation - so I decided to give it another try. I can't get over how natural this foundation looks while still providing amazing coverage! I use Laura Mercier setting powder to keep me matte. I should have never stopped using this foundation! I still sometime use other brands (tarte, urban decay, L'Oréal) for foundation and I can't say I'm a fan of any other bareminerals products, but this foundation is simply amazing!!!

I definitely recommend exfoliating and using a good primer before hand as this tends to cling to dry patches. But even if you let the foundation sit on the face for a bit, it seems to melt into the dry patches and blurs them! Important is to take your time and buff, it really does give great natural coverage and you can definitely build to full coverage. Use a fluffy concealer brush for problem areas and any redness literally just disappears. I find that the mineral veil really helps to set my makeup and keep me from getting shiny too quickly (and trust me I usually get shiny within a hour or 2 of applying makeup). It also seems to calm my acne prone skin. Highly recommend!"

When I first used this foundation, my face looked like a cakey mess! I The powder settled into ALL of my pores, clung onto all of my dry patches, and creased around the one blemish I had on my cheek. It almost looked like my face was covered in pitted acne scars, which I don't have...I initially thought that it might have been because of the new primer I was trying out or that I might have applied too much product at once so I decided to give it another shot. I used this with my holy grail moisturizer and pore minimizing primer and it still looked the exact same as it did the first time. I tried applying it with different brushes, in different weather conditions and it looked terrible every time.

Buy this foundation if you have oily skin because it is way better than liquid! Only thing is that I use a bb cream on my large pore areas to fill them in before i apply the foundation.

Before I put it on I use CeraVe moisturizing lotion and it helps. Although this powder sort of settles into the pores on my nose and if I have a dry flakey patch of skin on my cheeks. If I moisturize well before applying it minimizes the drying cakiness. After a few hours of wear the oils on my face make this look dewy and less cakey and dry, which I like. I'm sure that if I used a primer before putting this on it would help, i'll try that. I'd say definitely make sure to moisturize well before. Oh if it's a hot day this looks really gross if your face sweats lol, it kind of melts. Oh and when I wear sunglasses it wipes the foundation off on my nose. I don't usually get acne except maybe one or two pimples per month around the same time. But I have some redness and discoloration and visible blood vessels in my face. This foundation helps the redness but is not very full coverage. I don't like to put more than one layer on either. However Bare Minerals foundation does make my face look very good and thankfully the fair shade isn't too orangey like many liquid foundations!"

I was sad about having to replace it bc I really loved the way it covered and the way it felt on my skin- until I turned 32 and got oily. Another issue I've always had, but dealt with, was that it definitely didn't last all day even before the oil problem, so it always had to be re-done before I could go anywhere after work.

I recommend this for people who are looking for easy application and light coverage."

Just the smallest amount completely covers up any redness. I've actually used it as a spot concealer on occasion, that's how full coverage it is.  The only thing is, it doesn't take much to become cakey, at least on my skin. But my skin doesn't hold up well under a lot of makeup, so that might just be me.

I used it every day for two months in various ways.  I loved how it looked right when I applied it, and it truly didn't feel like I was wearing much of anything.  It was easy to blend my other face products (blush, bronzer, highlighter) into.  Yet, I hate this foundation.  I have combination skin and no matter what I did this foundation broke down within ninety minutes of applying it every single day, despite using various primers, being in various weather/temperature conditions, and setting it with a number of different setting powders and/or setting sprays.  I built it up in layers on my face with different kinds of brushes, varying from three layers for fuller coverage and one layer for light coverage.  It was worst on my forehead, nose, and chin, which are admittedly the most oily parts of my face.  But, it also broke down on my cheeks and they're pretty dry.  For what it's worth, I manage a jewelry store so it's not like I applied it before running a marathon or something.  I just couldn't win with this foundation so I finally threw it away in disgust.  I must be an anomaly since most people seem to really love and rave about this foundation, but thought it may be helpful to post my experience in case anyone out there thinks they're doing something wrong because it's acting the same way on their skin.  PSA:  you're probably not--find a new foundation."

If you're going on a night out, do your whole face and then I very gently and lightly use this as a setting powder, it'll cover up all the imperfections your makeup underneath didn't cover.  Overall, this powder is amazing and does everything and more. It is definitely worth the purchase."

So don't get frustrated if you try it and there looks like there is no coverage. You have to slowly build up the coverage, and make sure you let the layers set. It takes time but this is definitely a build-able foundation. You have to try this foundation a few times to see how it works for you best. The brush that you use also really impacts the coverage. My personal recommendation on applying this brush is a small dense face brush, as opposed to a powder brush which will not get you much coverage."

However, I recently found a shade from a different brand that actually matches my skin tone better & blends in to match my tone perfectly. The shades in this line just don't quite match correctly. It also would sometimes sting when I applied it, not sure why. I never figured out if it was only after certain skin care treatments or only after sun exposure? And I don't tend to have sensitive skin. It didn't ever turn my face red, just uncomfortable stinging which would eventually dissipate but could flare up again if I got hot & sweaty which is common in Texas summers. But I just loved buffing it in with that brush that came with it, watching it melt in & blur imperfections. I was totally sucked in to those infomercials back in the day lol."

And if you use a very thin layer of primer ( I use bare minerals prime time ) it doesn't cling to any of your dry spots.

Although it wasn't terrible, it was uneven from acne medication and scarring, and I would always break out in the most conspicuous areas on my face. With that said, I have always sought out a foundation that would accommodate my needs. I wanted good coverage, a formula that wouldn't accentuate the dry skin of my scars, something that actually covered acne, and something that would not oxidize or look disgusting at the end of the day.  Little did I know, heavy duty full coverage was not what I needed. Estée launders double wear, makeup forever mat velvet , nars, urban decay, revlon color stay, Loreal true match - every holy grail or top 10, I would try. But bare minerals is all I could ask for.  1. It matches my skin tone - one of only 6 foundations at Sephora that actually do. 5Y06, so I am quite light but with a strong yellow undertone. Any pink would make me look grey or orange.  2. It's so easy. The biggest possible mistake with this is application, but once you get it down you're golden. I now spot conceal redness and just quickly buff this in all over to even things out.  3. It's good for you. Liquid foundations just don't let your skin breathe the same way minerals do. In fact, I think switching to bare minerals really helped clear my skin up.  4. It looks amazing. My biggest issue aside from uneven skin is pores and this foundation practically eliminates them. Not to mention the fact that the finish is so healthy looking. You practically glow.  It will not accentuate any peeled skin or fine lines. If you need some extra staying power, i always use the Nivea aftershave and it works wonders. I also spray some fix plus if I feel like it looks a little powdery.  Truly recommend, especially as a first time foundation."

So I decided to splurge and give bareMinerals a try. First off, let me say that this was my first time ordering online from Sephora. The shipping was AMAZING... I ordered this Wednesday afternoon, got free standard shipping, and it arrived Thursday morning! Was so, so impressed by that. But let me also just say that this foundation is more than worth the investment. When you apply it properly, it goes on so evenly with your skin. Paired with the mineral veil it gives you an excellent, natural looking glow. It lasts all day, in fact it appears to look better throughout the day as the minerals sit on your skin. I got the light shade and was a bit worried at first that it was too dark. But I do have more yellow-olive undertones in my skin so it blends in quite nicely for me. If you have light skin with more pinky undertones I'd definitely recommend going with the lighter shades. What a BEAUTIFUL product this is! 5 stars! Thank you bareMinerals!"

I was originally matched to the wrong color at the bareminerals store (fairly light), but I loved the finish of the foundation so I decided to give it another go and match myself.  Ultimately, I ended up with golden medium which is perfect for my olive skin w/yellow undertones.  I purchased several brushes, primer, well rested concealer (?), and a blush.  After prepping my skin as I normally do, I applied the primer followed by the foundation (waited about 10 minutes for the primer to dry first).  It was horrible!  I was so disappointed.  I thought maybe I just didn't let the primer dry long enough so the next day I waited 20 mins for the primer to dry and I ended up with the same horrible result.  I placed the fault on the foundation and I almost returned it.  Then it occurred to me that I wouldn't normally use a silicone based primer with a powder foundation so the next day I used my regular powder primer from ED Naturals and voila - magic.  No more funky separation on or around my nose and when I touch my face no more funky streaks or dragging of the foundation.  No more settling into my fine lines.  Bottom line for me, the foundation is a winner, but the primer is not."

I do like how the application makes it look like I don't have any makeup on, and it's nice for my casual, laid back days. However, I think in the grand scheme of things, I simply prefer liquid foundation over powder/mineral foundation. The positive aspects of this foundation is that it is long wearing. It also minimizes the appearance of my pores. I find that I don't get as oily throughout the day with this foundation either. They negative aspects is that it doesn't make my skin look all that much better than my bare skin. I took some before and after pictures and I wasn't incredibly convinced that the foundation did anything more than neutralize a little bit of some hyperpigmentation on my cheeks. It kind just makes my face look monochromatic, but it doesn't give a luminosity, dewiness that I'm used to seeing from a liquid foundation finish. All to say that if you're liking a very matte and very natural foundation finish, this might be the right makeup for you. In the end, I am not quite unhappy enough to want to return the product. But I am also practical enough that this will probably be my go-to makeup when I am running small errands in the daytime and you won't catch me wearing this foundation while out to dinner with friends or family."

The coverage is amazing, the staying power is also really great. I usually do 2 layers to cover some redness and pigmentation left from past blemishes and it never feels too much. I use a flat top buffing brush and a very small flat top for extra coverage in certain spots if I need. They claim its so gentle you can sleep in it and I can say that this claim is true.

I have combination skin, but more normal during the Canadian winters, and I have quite a bit of scarring, but they're almost gone. This covers everything perfectly, and if I want more coverage in one area, I can just spot conceal with this foundation too. No matter how much you use it won't look cakey, and from what I found out, it doesn't dry out the skin too much either. It honestly doesn't feel like I'm wearing foundation at all.  I have noticed that with continued use, my skin has been more clarified, and my pores don't get clogged anymore as I used to get clogged pores with liquid foundation.

I have combination skin - this product doesn't make me look shiny throughout the day. The powder itself is so soft and silky (a bit like flour) and blends into the skin so beautifully. It looks very natural, much more so than other ones I've tried, like the makeup forever hd foundation. This has become my new favorite foundation! The only prob me is that the container becomes so messy! The mechanism that you twist to close the product when not in use doesn't work very well (if shaken, even with that plastic closed, powder will be all over the lid!). This is not a good product to travel with but a good foundation overall. Will repurchase again."

I had a similar experience with Boscia's BB Cream which is also glittery (mica!) and oxidized after only a few hours. Broke me out terribly and smashed my trust in foundations. Why would you do this?

Nowadays, I only wear sunscreen and get tons of compliments on my skin, whereas when I wear bareMinerals, I get no compliments! It is the opposite from when I first started wearing BM.  Maybe the change is in my skin, so I will try other makeup brands to see. But as of right now, my opinion is that something is different with BM original foundation."

For those who are afraid of a powder because they have dry skin or don't want to look cakey: moisturizer well, really (REALLY) buff this powder in with a flat top brush and set it with a dewy setting spray. Without taking those steps I've found it to occasionally look cakey. Overall this stuff has really saved my skin and with a few extra steps it looks flawless."

This is hard to detect on the skin, so that's why you have to blend for a long time and how long it takes to build coverage. You only need a little bit of product contrary to popular belief. Due to how long it takes to blend and build coverage I took a star off but it's easy to get over considering how natural it looks and how little you can feel it on the skin."

I was looking for something natural-looking and light but with a decent amount of coverage and this powder foundation definitely gave me that. It looked and felt wonderful for the first few days. I applied it with the travel kabuki brush, also from Bare Minerals. I had heard a lot of great things about this product and a few negatives, mainly about breakouts occurring from using it. I ignored those reviews, as I have very tame skin and very rarely get break outs. I used this for about a week, maybe even less, when I started breaking out severely. I immediately discontinued using it. I got the breakouts all over, mainly on the lower part of my face. It took about a month or two for everything to completely clear up. I'm now back to clean and clear skin. I still use the kabuki brush to apply my new foundation, because I love it, but this foundation didn't work for me, sadly. Highly recommended to anyone that doesn't have sensitive skin. As I said before, beautiful finish, nice product- just not for me."

The pink in it helps me look less yellow. When I switch to other foundations everyone comments on how pale and tired I look. I highly recommend Multi Tasking minerals (I use Bisque) for dark undereye circles. I also love the All-Over face color in Glee--I just use it as a blush. The reason this gets 4 stars instead of 5: it can settle into fine lines and appear cakey on dry skin if you're not careful. I use Ponds dry skin cream in the winter to help...and I would recommend a dimethicone/silicone-based primer to fill in your fine lines if you're 35+. Overall this foundation gives a nice glowy look, and blends really well. Set it with the Mineral Veil to avoid being too shiny or shimmery. You'll definitely want a lipstick when you wear this foundation, as your lips will look more bare and dull in comparison to your luminescent skin. What I don't recommend from this line: the lipstick and mascara. Better off going to the drugstore--just not worth the price. The brow powders are ok but nothing special. The eyeshadow are very pigmented. I like Drama (although it tends to make me look like a harlot)."

The best thing is that it's a foundation and a concealer in one, so it saves you time if you're in a crunch to do your makeup.

I've been using the bare mineraIs foundation for about 3 weeks now and I am still shocked at the fact that it's medium-to-full coverage (you have to keep building it up, little by little) and it did not break me out at all! To be honest, it has actually helped my skin breathe and so prevented new breakouts. All in all, the application process takes a while to get used to, and it can be tedious to keep blending until your wrist hurts, BUT it's so worth it, my skin hasn't felt this good in years.

I have combination skin with an oily T-zone, so a few hours into the day, I have to blot or touch up. Again, primer helps.

Coverage is exceptional. I read a lot of gals saying it looks powdery on their faces but truth is is that you're not applying it right. The amount of makeup does not change the coverage, the brush does! Use a more dense, shorter brush for full coverage and a looser brush for light coverage. Never add more product than necessary because only then will you see the product sitting on the face. This foundation looks perfect every time and Is great for my combination skin!"

But after visiting a relative whose skin ALWAYS seems to look so perfect, she told me she ONLY uses mineral foundation and mineral veil, & said that if she DIDN'T use them, her skin would be shiny after a few hours. So I immediately bought the Bare Minerals starter kit, which includes the original foundation, mineral veil, cover up, and primer, and I LOVE IT SO MUCH!! It is VERY easy to use, takes LESS time than my old routine, and LOOKS JUST AS GOOD AT THE END OF THE DAY AS IT DID AT THE BEGINNING!! That is CRAZY-unbelievable! It definitely takes a little playing with (but not too much) to figure out your coverage (a TEENY TINY bit goes a LONG way!), but that's the same with ANY new foundation. AND I've had NO breakouts since I started using it!! Despite my age, I've continued to have breakouts periodically - nothing awful, and definitely worse during certain hormonal swings, but I pretty much ALWAYS have at least one blemish, usually several. But NOT since starting Bare Minerals! And NOTHING else in my routine has changed - NOTHING! So I completely credit BM for that! Summed up - EASY to use, GREAT coverage, lasts ALL DAY (with NO shine whatsoever, even when I spent HOURS in the hot sun with high humidity!!), and NO breakouts! Could I be MORE excited?

I first buff the original powder all over my face because I love the glow that it gives. I personally do not find it to be shimmery at all. It just gives a youthful glow to your skin. It is also weightless and feels like you are not wearing any makeup at all. I then like to use the matte powder on the oily areas of my face like my chin and around my nose. The matte also works great as a concealer and to cover dark under eye circles if used with a concealer brush. I also use the bareMinerals warmth, blush, and mineral veil to finish the look. This makeup stays on all day long and I have really put it to the test with this hot humid Louisiana weather!"

I later learned that almost all bareMinerals colors (from fair to deep) are famous for being either much too yellow or much too pink; very few are truly neutral. By the way, the company's foundations are generally not fair-skin friendly. And, unfortunately, bareMinerals fell into the classic mistake of assuming that the fairest people have pink undertones. PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE update your foundation line to include more shades and more universal undertones.  Bottom line: if you have strong yellow or pink undertones in your skin, this may just be perfect for you, but definitely head to your nearest retailer and test it out first."

People kept pointing out my beautiful, glowing skin. Even strangers approach me to compliment my skin sometimes. I have noticed little to no breakouts nowadays.  It does not provide full coverage, but it provides enough to dim hyperpigmentation/ dark spots. Without a setting powder, it provides a dewy finish on my face.

However, if you're looking for a full coverage foundation I wouldn't recommend this one. I have tried building coverage but my red hyper pigmentation spots do still slightly show. I docked it a star due to powder's inconvenient packaging. You do lose product inevitably when you swirl your brush through it. In addition, the packaging isn't that great. You have to be careful with the lid and closing it or product will fall out once you open it again. Overall I am pleased with it. It does a good job on giving a very natural look."

It last for the whole day for me, and I've even slept with it on in the library hahaha. I looked great waking up hahaha Usually I like to give 2 light layers all over my face, then take a small brush and spot conceal with the foundation. I have ALOT of acne scars and this covers them pretty decently. I don't always conceal with this because it is time consuming but it is doable. This product definitely has a learning curve to it, so just practice putting it on and also, a little goes a long way. Tap a little amount into the cap, swirl your brush in, tap the excess and buff into the skin. Do light layers! Do not cake it on in one spot because it will look cakey like that.

Not only did it help my skin but it also looks flawless! Beautiful finish! I have tried so many different foundations both high end and drug store and sadly they all make me break out. I always come back to this foundation!!! No matter how many different ones I try or how expensive they are this is always what I go back to nothing compares! Definitely recommend this product especially if u have acne prone skin."

It does have build-able coverage so I can control the amount of makeup I am wearing. For a night time look, I just put more powder on. I have tried other mineral powders and the consistency cannot beat bareMinerals' creamy texture, I do notice that the powder tends to settle in the fine lines near my eyes, accentuating my wrinkles, so I don't use this on any place that may have fine lines or wrinkles. I don't want to look older! I use a separate concealer for those areas. I have been using this since my early 20's (I am now 27) and always come back to this foundation."

The seldom times I do a full face, I usually wear a pretty light coverage CoverGirl mineral powder foundation just to get a more even skin tone, but this time I wanted to try something a little more professional. I also purchased the bareMinerals Precision Face Brush to use with it.  Okay, as for this bareMinerals powder, I am thoroughly dissatisfied. The color matching was fine (Fairly Light for me), but it really does cling to any slightly different texture spot on your skin, so even though the color matches you can still plainly see (and feel) the powder on your skin. ALSO--it positively BURIES itself in your pores. I wore this yesterday and I washed my face with my normal makeup remover--it was not able get this powder out of my pores.  I've never had problems with acne and my skin isn't particularly sensitive to makeup, but today I woke up with four large angry zits in different areas of my face and my entire forehead is bumpy with clogged pores. I've never had this happen using any other makeup. Nothing in my routine was different besides wearing this foundation so I have no doubts that it is to blame. Obviously, I am incredibly non-plussed with their promise that it improves the look of your skin over time. What, does it have to get worse before it gets better? No thanks.  TL;DR--be wary of this foundation, it could clog your pores."

I can put on a fair amount in the morning and come home from a seven hour school day, wash my face, and there doesn't seem to be any trace of this foundation. The redness starts to slowly come back throughout the day as well. I haven't tried any other mineral foundations to compare it to because I want to use this up before I buy a new one.

Just now I learned how to use this properly! I now use the Real Techniques powder brush and just a teeny tiny amount in the lid, swirl the brush around and then blend, blend, blend, blend..... and layer it up like that. Also, I use a Smashbox primer underneath (which I never liked before with any other foundation because somehow it made my foundation fall off even faster). So now, I have the beautiful glowy sheen but without the cakeyness, have full coverage but still look oh so natura and it feels like you're wearing no make-up at all. Plus it stays on all day (normal activities).

Used Chanel, Laura Mercier, Hourglass, Neutrogena, Becca, Chantecaille and totally forgot about old faithful BM. Then I was watching an online video with a makeup artist who has similar skin problems that I do (oily) and I thought - this guy's skin looks great! What is he using? Well turns out he is usually wearing BM when he films his videos. So I tried this again and I'm like WHY DID I EVER LEAVE? It's not even that expensive when I consider some of the other $$$ stuff I was using. And I'm getting compliments on my skin again! At 45! My only bridge to cross with this foundation is that I have some large pores on my nose and if I didn't buff it enough, it seemed to accentuate those pores, but that is just a matter of my own application. You really only need a teeeenie bit of this stuff and then buff, buff, buff with a professional type brush. Gotta invest in the right brush for this stuff."

I have adult hormonal acne only treated with a medicine that I can’t take at this time. Anyways, finding good facial products is tricky because not only do I get raised, red bumps on my face but I also have dry patches all over. Not only did this mineral foundation NOT cover my acne but it also helped emphasize each and every bit of dryness on my face. Also the golden medium color oxidized quickly on my skin. It looked weird and orange-y within minutes after application with my Tarte airbuki.  Perhaps this mineral foundation works best with oily skin or with fairly clear skin with minimal to no acne. If you have any dry patches then please test this a few times before you purchase. Just my suggestion."

I was blown away by the coverage I got also, it is a wonderful foundation and definitely becoming my HG. One thing you need though is time and patience, if you're looking for a quick throw on makeup this isn't for you, taking time and really buffing it out on your skin is what gives you that flawless airbrush look. Another positive is a little goes a long way so this should be able to last a decent amount of time. This is a 5 star foundation for sure!"

Probably not the best if you have any dry skin at all, or fine lines around your eyes or from dimples etc.  I used as little of the product as possible; it spreads very nicely and a little goes a long way.

			"review_text": "Oh boy, where to begin on this one? It's hands down the worst makeup product I have ever purchased. EVER. I purchased it because I eat fairly healthy and use mostly toxin-free makeup and skin care products. This was basically the last transition I needed to get all of my makeup to natural. For reference, I have fair, normal-to-dry skin. I am lucky to have clear skin and small pores. That said, this makeup made me look worse with makeup than without. I didn't know that was possible. I thought most makeup enhanced your features. I prefer the I'm wearing makeup but I don't LOOK like I'm wearing makeup look. Instead, I had cakey makeup and after about an hour I was a greasy mess. Not sure how--I have dry skin, so it did adhere to dry patchy areas, but the rest looked oily (not illuminated--great natural product for that glow is RMS Beauty Living Luminizer). On top of that, it clings to every hair on your face (and I spent time buffing). My skin also appeared sallow and grayish after it oxidized. The powder enhanced any possible line on my face that I never even knew I had and creased like crazy on my eyelids, around my mouth, etc. I only wear a tinted moisturizer for special occasions, and wear a powder for my normal makeup routine. I have NEVER had that level of creasing before with either product. It also caused me to break out a little on my chin and forehead. At the same time, I was itchy around my jawline. I gave this product two weeks, and even went back to purchase the BM brush to apply normal coverage. (I thought maybe my Sephora brush wasn't cutting it.) No, this is just a horrible, horrible product. On top of how bad it looked, this powder is a mess. I followed the directions, placing a small amount in the cap, swirling the brush, and tapping/blowing off excess. You will have powder all over your bathroom counter and sink. As someone who doesn't wear a ton of makeup and prefers a simple 5-minute makeup routine, this added too much time and cleanup for my liking. I returned the foundation powder and the brush."

In any case, I'll likely use this every day, AND it wears so well! It actually gives me a slightly satin/dewey finish, which I adore, and it feels so lightweight and trustworthy.  The only con I have with this foundation is that unfortunately, the lightest shade is not light enough for me in the colder months, but matches nicely when I have a bit of sun. If this foundation went a shade/shade and a half lighter, it would be my be-all, end-all. Still, I love it so dearly that I just blend down the neck! If you are interested in this foundation please do yourself a favour and get a sample or do research on colouring! It is an incredible foundation and looks amazing on all skin tones and types!

I have tried few different ways to apply it and application method is key to using this one I found. Best brush that works for me is is the tarte buffer brush and the real techniques expert brush and I pick up the tiniest amount at a time to buff in each time and build it up to how I want the coverage to be. If you swirl a large amount all at once, it will look cake and blotchy. It looks so natural and feels airy on the skin if applied the right way and the finish is very brightening and awakening! The only complaint I have is that the jar lid is too small to swirl tarte buffer brush.

Comfortable--takes a minute to apply--lasts all day--provides me with an even skin tone (having fair skin I am prone to redness). I began using this 5 years ago and never looked back.

It seems to me it isn't as easy to apply light layers upon layers as it used to be? It also doesn't seem to have the same staying power.

You have to follow the directions exactly though or you won't get the results you want. You must use a kabuki brush or the recommended bareMinerals brush. Then, tap a very small amount of powder from the tin into the lid. You will need far less than you think you will.

I use a real techniques buffing brush to buff in a small amount (and I mean reallyyy buff it in!) and it looks flawless! My pores don't disappear, but then again nothings ever done that. Depending on how much you use, I'd say it's light-medium coverage.

It doesn't cover everything, but tones it down to the point that I am very happy. I think this might even do a better job than liquid foundation because it kind of sits on the skin and covers beautifully but is lightweight. I use the max cover concealer brush to first apply the foundation to the spots and redness so that it's concentrated coverage and then buff a little extra all over with the full flawless face brush. For light coverage, I just buff all over. I will say that it is not super long lasting, but I find that taking a small amount and buffing after a few hours refreshens it. Sometimes I use Urban Decay deslick and it seems to make the foundation last longer. It is a great every day foundation. I can't say enough good things about BM and I love that it has spf 15.

However, it does get oily if you put on a moisturizer on first before you apply. If I didn't use a lotion, then it didn't get oily throughout the day.  It doesn't hide blemishes great, but it makes them more subtle in a way that looks natural, not like makeup caked on your face.  I would keep buying this product if not for what my dermatologist said yesterday. If you have acne prone skin, you probably shouldn't buy this makeup. If not, it does have a nice finish to it."

First of all, let me start off by saying that I have, maybe not the worst, but not the best acne problem. So, needless to say, coverage was one of my biggest issues when I was choosing out my next foundation to use. This mineral foundation gives the same coverage as a BB cream, definitely not as good as a liquid foundation. But considering that this is a mineral foundation, that's pretty good. Since buying this foundation, the longest that I've been out at one time while wearing this foundation has been 7-8 hours and this foundation has lasted the entire time, which I'm extremely glad for. However, while it does stay on, it does have a tendency to become slightly oily throughout the day, which you can easily fix with oil blotting sheets or keeping around a setting powder (I prefer the sheets).  Also, as a side note, I read a review in which someone said that this product was too itchy? I didn't experience this problem, but when I looked into the ingredients, this foundation, as well as most other mineral foundation and powdered products, contains bismuth oxychloride, which may cause irritation and itchiness to the skin, as well as possibly acne. So if you're someone with skin that is sensitive, I would do a little more in depth research on this product before you purchase it."

			"review_text": "I first started using Bare Minerals after coming across it at a factory outlet centre in Las Vegas whilst on vacation. Before then I had been using a Maybelline 24hr stay liquid foundation and it had not been working for me (skin still became oily and cause major breakouts). The lady in store recommended it to me, saying not only would it be better for my skin it would improve it, it would also give me great coverage and be easier to apply - being a powder. All the things that the lady said in-store was true. I have been using it for over 6 months and my acne-prone skin has improved dramatically. I'm still on my first jar (mind you it nearly over) and use it nearly every day, It works great with a primer (the bare minerals one works particularly well) but I've worn it plenty of times without and it still works wonders. For those with a deep-skin tone wondering whether this product has the right shade from you - I'm a NW40 in Mac and I find Golden Tan a great match to my skin tone. As its a powder you can really blend it into your skin so even if the colour is a little off with enough buffing you can find the perfect balance between coverage and colour. I usually apply it with a blush or powder brush - no need to buy the bare minerals one and a little goes a long way. It is also very build-able if you're looking for extra coverage. The only cons I would give it, is that if you have excessively oily skin maybe matte bare minerals is better suited, and this eventually after a 4-5 hrs will become slightly oily (use some blotting paper or pressed powder) and the coverage is not as good as a liquid although fairly close. If you're considering buying this product I strongly urge you to give it a go, it works better then you think and is a lot cheaper then other brands for the amount and quality you get."

I decided to treat myself last week and I can't believe I ever used anything else! I will say that watching the tutorial videos at BE really helped- a little goes a long way, buff like your life depends on it, and build coverage with light layers. My skin is luminous and I can decide the amount of coverage I want depending on what my day looks like. It always looks natural, feels great on my skin, and touches up flawlessly. I have found that using a primer or BB creme before you get started makes a huge difference! I recommend getting the Get Started kit with the primer, original formula foundation, matte formula foundation, brush, mineral veil and warmth bronzer. The price is right and you can try a lot of products out to decide which ones you really like. Also, get shade matched in store! I thought I would go darker in the summer but the tan shades were still too deep for me- turns out an extra layer of bronzer was all I needed to match my summer glow!"

The trick is not to use too much, you just need a small amount on the cap and that is enough for a light coverage. Just put more on the cap after your first application for a higher coverage. This is slightly inconvenient since you have to put your brush down, it can become messy, and it takes longer than liquid foundation. But after you buff, the foundation will stay on your face for the rest of the day. Buff for at least a minute to get all the powder to stick to your face.  It does take to some work to get the coverage that you need. I like that it doubles as a concealer when you use any concealer brush. Buffing is your friend. Also using a primer and the mineral veil helps it last all day on my face. It is now my go to for the spring/summer. BB creams don't work for my oily/normal skin during the humid days we have in NYC."

When I put it on, it looks flawless! Absolutely beautiful...Covers up everything I need it to, gives me a natural healthy glow, and I feel sexy with it...Then a few hours go by and it just doesn't hold up at all, it looks terrible! It gets super blotchy down the center of my nose, totally evaporates on the cheeks like nothing is there...I feel prettier with no make-up at all. I've tried different lotions, primers, brushes, nothing helps...It just kind of stinks because it looks beautiful when first applied, but after 5 hours I look like poo. Another thing is that I can feel it on my face too. I barely apply a dime size-nickel size amount on my face so it's not like I apply tons to my face to cake it up. Also, After a couple days I already started breaking out =( I guess it's not for everyone.... It is strange too, because I don't have oily skin what so ever, yet with this foundation, I feel like I do...No good."

No matter what I tried I couldn't get this foundation to work for me. So it sat for a couple of years in my drawer because I felt guilty to throw it out.  Fast forward to now, I came across it again and decided to try a different technique with it. I dumped a little of the foundation into a very small dish and then sprayed my mineral hydrating facial mist on top of it (one spray). I then mixed it together with my brush and it became a light weight liquid. I found that it spread evenly and the coverage was a lot better and it looked more natural. Shortly after I applied it to my face it dried to a powder finish. I mixed it in small portions as I was applying it on a certain area of my face before I moved on to the next. I am now happy with using the foundation and glad I can put it to use. My acne has actually cleared up a bit with use of it. I hope my review might help some other people who was having the same difficulty I was. If you don't have a facial mist spray I suggest making a small spray bottle and just filling it with water and follow the same steps (making sure when you spray its very light). However some of you might just try their new liquid foundation instead. ;) Either way works."

Bareminerals brushes work well at applying the minerals but I find them super scratchy and uncomfortable. Bareminerals was the first foundation I ever wore and it will probably be the last!

The only thing that works longer than 3 months to keep my moderate acne at bay is an oral pill. It works for my acne, but I do have to be careful to use only non-comedogenic and gentle makeup/cleansers/lotions.  This product: I was concerned it did not say non-comedogenic anywhere. I called the brand and they told me ALL of their products are non-comedogenic, so it is not listed anywhere. I have tried the matte foundation before, and it dried out my skin, even in the somewhat oily areas. I gave this one a try, it has been over 2 weeks now, and this foundation definitely does not cause acne or dry out my skin. I didn't believe the reviews that said it made their skin better, but, I'm becoming a believer. I seem to have better skin without makeup than I did before. When I do have a breakout, this makeup seems to actually help the breakout heal faster than normal.  Coverage: The coverage is not light, which I was used to, it's closer to a medium coverage. (I switched foundations once I realized my old one was not non-comedogenic) For work and nice occasions, however, medium coverage has proven to be great for me. I love the added bonus of sunscreen. Sometimes I use a primer underneath, sometimes I don't. It doesn't seem to make much of a difference. The foundation doesn't have the BEST staying power through my oily areas after 8-10 hours, but I'm okay with that.  So far, I'll be sticking with this foundation.Hope this helps people that were on the fence about this product like I was!"

It does have pretty good coverage and you can build it up. I also like the staying power on it. It tends to last me all day. Some cons I do have with it is that it tends to cling on to any dry patches, so make sure you exfoliate. Also this is a big one, I find it really messy to apply. Which in the morning can be a pain to have to worry about. So just keep that in mind."

I bought this because I heard it has good coverage and is better for your skin. I was very skeptical, because i thought it was for older women and I am only 16, but I could not be happier with this product. It has the perfect coverage for me. I thought it would be too sheer, but it is medium and buildable. It covers all my redness and acne. Also I was scared it would look unnatural and powdery, but in my opinion it looks even more natural than liquids. It does not look powdery at all. It also is not drying. Lastly it is extremely easy to apply. I tap a little into the lid, swirl a flat top brush in it, and buff it all over my skin. IM OBSESSED. And my skin has been clearing up ever since I switched. Definitely recommend, especially for teens who have problem skin."

Recently, I gave BM another shot because it's about $20 cheaper than my current foundation, and let me tell you, I was really disappointed. I purchased the Fairly Light shade as I am pretty fair. The color did seem like a good match for me, but the foundation itself just didn't seem to absorb into my skin at all, even throughout the day. It seemed to just sit on my face and was really obvious to the naked eye. I also felt like it settled into fine lines under my eyes that I honestly didn't even know that I had! I'm only 30 years old! I've had years of experience with mineral powder so it definitely had nothing to do with the brush I was using or how I was blending it in. I use a high quality mineral brush from Sephora that has always worked very well for me, so I honestly believe it is just this foundation in combination with my skin. For the record, I have dry skin in the winter and pretty normal skin in the summer. I even tried using different moisturizers under this makeup and always got the same horrible results no matter what I used. I don't know if it is my skin or if the formula has changed or maybe I had the wrong shade (even though the shade did seem to match well).  I will not be repurchasing this foundation again for myself. I know many women that BM works wonders for, but it was awful for me. I would suggest getting some samples to try before purchasing it if you can. Try some different shades, with different moisturizers underneath, in different weather conditions, etc. I hope this foundation works better for others than it did for me!"

I have to say that this makeup actually CLEARED UP my adult acne. I am completely serious. So for younger skins battling acne, this stuff would be a godsend.

I usually use mineralogie makeup (which I LOVE LOVE LOVE) but needed to find a new foundation without vitamin A when I became pregnant. I remembered that years ago I had tried bareminerals and hated it so I steered clear from trying it again. However, after mutiple failed attempts with other foundations tried through sephora I finally ordered this and I am in LOVE. Not only does this makeup not break me out but it gives me full coverage without looking like I am even wearing makeup. I think that BareMinerals may actually provide me with better coverage than mineralogie and at a better price. I like to use the bare minerals radiance and their translucent veil as well. Ever since I started using this everyone at work told me I had the pregnancy glow (and trust me whenI take this makeup off there is no such glow lol). People even started guessing that I was pregnant with a little girl because they said that I was getting prettier.....well it ended up that I am pregnant with a little girl but I think the bareminerals played a large role in my beauty factor. Overall I highly recommend this product. I love that it doesn't settle into lines, gives a really even coverage and you can build how much coverage you need. Some days I even just use this as my concealer as well since it stays put so well. Love this product!"

I can't even count how many of these I've gone through since - it is a complete MUST HAVE. There are a few negative reviews here, though, which address some easily fixed issues:  1. For even, flawless coverage, you MUST get the BM kabuki brush, and swirl the minerals in the lid for a few seconds to warm/loosen them up. This is essential to distribute the foundation lightly and evenly over your face. Layer as needed - it's very buildable! But always use a light hand.  2. Apply concealer to any trouble spots first, if you have any. BM will cover them, but may not last all day there.  3. If you are using a moisturizer/primer OR have oily skin, matte-ify your face with a fine powder (such as the Mineral Veil, or, my personal choice, Make Up Forever's INCREDIBLE HD Microfinish Powder) before applying the minerals. This will help the foundation distribute evenly and stay out of pores (a common complaint from BM beginners).  Hope these tips help: look forward to looking FLAWLESS! ;-)"

If you want a fuller coverage this brush is great for that too. Just layer it until you get the look you like. Overall, I would highly recommend this product!"

During the times I was using these other products, not only was I not 100% satisfied with the results, but I did not receive a single compliment on my skin! Therefore, I came back to my tried and true LOVE, Bare Minerals. This product does everything I need it to do. It covers the sun spots while it evens out my skin tone, and gives me a healthy glow. You can't go wrong with this. Please do try it. Just make sure you find the correct shade for your skin. It took me three tries to get the right shade. Also, don't use too much.

I tried to use it several times, and each time, my skin was so itchy I wanted to scratch my face off by the time I got home from work. My mother wanted to try it, so I passed it on to her and she had the same reaction. Something in the product just didn't work with our skin. I'm still searching for th perfect powder foundation."

I use Clinique Dramatically Different Moisturizer first and then Bare Minerals, if I have time I use the Laura Mercier primer but that tends to be more for the extremely flawless, foundation look for outings. It doesn't look powdery and it does a pretty good job of absorbing oil. I would begin with applying only a little bit when practicing putting it on without a mirror because you can apply it unevenly if you're not looking. Loyal user for 5 yrs."

I went to the store and did the Color IQ. It said that I should use Medium Beige, which I thought looked too dark. The makeup artist tested it on me and said it was a perfect match. For the next few days, my face was a different color than my neck and chest. So I went online and ordered the Light. THAT one is the perfect match. I knew that Medium Beige was too dark.

Whether I have completely clear skin or I am broken out my skin always looks great! When the matte foundation came out I got it for when I'm feeling oily and I still find that the original covers better. The matte foundation sits on the surface and making it easier to see the find facial hairs. I can even use the light color when I have a tan in the summer time.

Yesterday, I tried it out and it looked absolutely amazing!! I looked like I was in a magazine, airbrushed and everything! I even went to the gym later on that night and sweated VERY much and when I came home, it still looked GORGEOUS! I am in love again with this foundation. I have very big pores and my skin can get very red, so I usually look for a medium to full coverage foundation with a natural finish, that also feels very light on the skin. This does the trick!!

You can't really build the coverage too much as the luminous /sheen finish then gets accentuated and in your attempt you could then end up with a forehead that looks like you applied waaaaay too much highlighter incorrectly.

I also get a fair number of red patches that require evening out, so I need foundation that can provide good coverage without looking cakey. I've tried liquid and other powder foundations over the years, but BareMinerals is the best one I've found. I use it in the lightest available shade, fair, which is a good match for my pale skin.  I like how the SPF 15 provides a bit of insurance coverage over my daily wear sunscreen (when you're pale and freckled like me, you can never have too much sun protection) though I would *not* recommend using this as your only sunscreen, since most women won't use enough product to get broad-spectrum protection. It also is one of the few products I've used that doesn't make my skin react badly or break out. And even though I have very dry skin, I find this does a good job of not settling into fine lines, though you really do need to moisturize first since this is most definitely a powder foundation.  Minor quibbles: I find this goes on too light with a brush, so I mostly use a dry sponge to apply. If I'm trying to get heavier coverage in a problem area, it can look cakey at times. I also find the packaging to be a pain, since I tend to spill a lot of product while I'm applying it."

My skin is a little on the drier side, but I noticed that liquid and mousse foundations gave me an 'oily/sweaty' look! I always had to reapply power multiple times a day and blot my face with oil sheets constantly! On top of that I spent countless times buying different foundation brands and shades and none seem to be the one for me. I kept on insisting that liquid was the way for me, until I finally caved in on buying bare minerals. I didn't understand what all the hype was but I'm glad I bought it. No oily face anymore! My face looks clear, smooth, and radiant. It is well worth its price!"

			"review_text": "when I FINALLY started using this foundation. In answering a Question I realized I should take more time to review this since I cannot do without it. Having Acne since I can remember, and it being traumatic as I grew up...Going through two rounds of Accutane, still using topical RX's and when bad, Antibiotics ~I still have ACNE! Guess it will make me look younger??? No it is still difficult.  Now, Finding just the right Tone/Shade- one that would cover, but also do something to lift & compliment my coloring was challenging. The straight up Medium- was not for me- and other gals I know. Blah! Medium Beige, same. I am 1/2 Italian, and 1/2 Slovak/Czech. (for reference) I think it finally took me 3 years of trying all the way to Medium Tan (too dark for me) and prior - tried the Summer Bisque Multitasking Concealer (a bit too pinkish and ok for pre-concealing, and last touch concealor...) Then they came out with the Golden Medium. YAY!!!! It's just enough color to do something attractive, but has just enough gold-ish tone to it to TRULY COVER and counter act under eye circles, red areas, those veins that appeared out of nowhere and just about anything else you may want to vanish away. Mind you, this is not accomplished in 5 minutes. Buildable coverage. Also worth mentioning, I sometimes use CoverFx M40, now G40 as a supplement when I really need the full artillery.  I use a Tiny detailed brush Pro Gel Liner Brush #26 Sephora Collection for the tiny brown spots, blemishes, etc. I am an Artist, and love intricate detail. BUT this really PRE CONCEALs teeny imperfections beautifully. Then I use Cover Fx pointed Brush. (Sephora makes similar ~ # 58) It works everywhere. Eyelids, Under eyes, T area.... Sorry BM. Then the Sephora Kabuki Brush (not the retractable- PQ ) for Everywhere. This one is more $$ but has lasted. Go undereyes again with a Concealer Brush...Then go over small imperfections again, now with Cover Fx ~ a Dot here, a Dot there, inner eyes... and there is a Regular face!! Thank you Bare Min.s for helping me feel better about myself!"

Do some research for best results, try other mineral foundations, then settle on bareMinerals if that's what works best for you.  I've used Susan Posnick's mineral powder foundation during summer months for years. The foundation is outstanding, but the brush applicator (which also holds the foundation and is delivered internally via the brush) gets clogged often. So I thought I'd try bareMinerals--it gets outstanding reviews and the product is housed separately from the brush applicator.  The product just doesn't work for my skin, in fact, it highlights my imperfections.  Instead of blending into my complexion, it seems to sit on top of my skin. It's obvious--my pores never looked so big. And, the powder gathers in oilier areas of my face, while blending perfectly into the most healthy spots. I stood several feet away from my mirror, and was horrified, to be honest.  It's buildable, that's for sure, but do it at your own risk--I found it to look cakey in the oily areas of my face, even with one sweep. Building the foundation only made me look like Tammy Faye.  The feel is tight and irritating. And my complexion appeared flat, not luminous like the Posnick brand effect.  All this feedback is too bad, because honestly, the color match for this product was outstanding.  Powder foundations can work flawlessly with many complexions, but for others, a fluid mineral foundation is the way to go, or, another brand of mineral powder.  Just keep an open mind and don't forget there are other products on the market besides this one. And another tip--if you really MUST use a primer with mineral powder, it's probably the wrong formula for you. It should effortlessly blend into your skin (after your moisturizer has absorbed completely) and provide a glowing, gorgeous finish."

This foundation is breathable, so it will not clog your pores and cause other problems like liquid does. I recommend using with a small liquid concealer for bad spots. I found this foundation does not cooperate well with dry patches of skin, so if you often have peeling skin I wouldn't use this. This is probably the only foundation out there that is good for your skin."

I heard a lot of people rave and said this is a good foundation for acne prone skin, so i decided to pick it up and try it, then i literally fell IN LOVE with this! Nothing can replace this foundation, not only did it not break me out but it gave my face a flawless natural finish, making me look as if i don't even have foundation on! Although the product is really good, i do notice that i get oily around my T zone area after a while of wearing it. This product is a MUST for girls like me who suffer from acne, because not only did it make my face look flawless it also one of the ONLY products that helped my acne stop."

However, there are also several reasons I took off two stars: it settles in fine lines in few hours and it also reacts with the oil on my skin and gets cakey so I have to smooth it out with the brush and add more foundation or mineral vail. The makeup looks nice again after I've touch it up but I never felt the need to reapply with a more traditional liquid foundation; as a result, the product is gone much more quickly. It's not good around the eye area- seriously awful- so I had to purchase liquid concealer to use with it. For me, the pros out weigh the cons so i will probably buy it again."

For the past two years I have developed pretty bad Melasma and uneven skin tone from sun damage and pregnancy which are very hard to fix and treat and take time to do so, so while I am trying to alleviate that problem I have used nearly everything out there (make-up wise) to help create an even tone and cover up the Melasma, which is very hard to do. I use concealer as well, but it is the bare minerals powder that helps finish up the look perfectly, almost better than the concealer alone at times, but it make me feel better to have the concealer on as well. Most full-coverage foundations are think, liquid, heavy foundations that just feel gross on my skin and this pretty much feels like nothing on and has buildable coverage! Its taken me a couple times to figure out my perfect shade but its worth it because the Melasma has definitely hurt my self-esteem over the past couple years. I am slowly getting it to fade but having this powder helps me feel like I dont have to put as much make up on and cover up so much!!"

Started using this in my late teens when acne was a big concern and my skin was pretty oily. It did the job of covering effectively without looking cakey. In the last year or so, I started using the Oil Cleansing Method for cleaning my face (such a money saver too!), which seems to have made my skin much more balanced. Acne is still a concern, although to a lesser degree. Lately I've noticed that the bareMinerals foundation was making my face look dull, dry, and very powdered down, despite using moisturizer and primer. My skin felt itchy after applying it too. Overall, I'd recommend this foundation to those who are more on the oily side, but I'm off to find something better suited for me now that my skin seems to be drier - looking for that dewey glow :)"

It also works extremely well as a concealer, covering my acne and blending into my face. The natural ingredients don't clog my pores and cause irritation, and holds up their claim of feeling natural enough to sleep in. Because the foundation works so well, it isn't necessary to use very much and should last months. The wide range of shades to select is perfect- I have very, very fair skin and usually have a difficult time finding foundations that match my skin tone. The Fair shade is PERFECT for me, and I've never seen my face look so naturally even in skin tone. I highly recommend!"

It covers about 75% of my blemishes and scars, I still need to use concealer/coverup and for that I use a stick or liquid. Do I think it HELPS with breakouts, or makes my skin better? NO. I've had acne since I was 8 years old and no chemicals, natural remedies, makeup has completely removed it. I lay this on super thick, probably 3-4 layers to really cover, and doing that, this product lasts me about a month and a half if I wear it like this every day.  The reason why I like this is that it is easy to blend in comparison to liquids or cream foundations. I like to mix it with the mineral veils, or with MUFE HD powder to give a nice even look. Sometimes I will mix the powder with the primer to make a nice even cream to go on, I find it gives a thicker coverage especially if you're going out or need your makeup to last a while, because it is more like a creamy paste.  I also use a synthetic fiber soft focus brush, not a natural brush, to really get around those blemishes without irritation from rough brushes.  All in all, this is great whether you have acne skin, rough skin, or perfect skin. It's lightweight and you can wear as much or little as you want or need."

I'm told that it glows, and girls...everyone wants to hear that they glow now and then. I use Medium Tan in the summer and Medium Beige in the winter. As an added bonus, this foundation is great for my skin, it hides large pores and helps clear up my skin, I've had minimal breakouts since switching back even though I tend to sleep in my makeup (bad bad I know). Ladies, remember to moisturize and let your lotion dry otherwise the powder will stick and look cakey, also make sure to use the concealer brush for a flawless complexion. Note that I did try the Matte version and was very disappointed, it made my skin look very sallow and dull, the orignal formula is the best, I rave about it everywhere I go."

What I love about this foundation is the ability to easily decide the amount of coverage you want. You can easily have light, medium, or heavy coverage. I do think it takes a little practice and recommend playing with it before you leave the house for the first time to figure out how to get your desired coverage. I go back and forth between fairly light and fairly medium. I love that these shades don't make my face look pink. BE has been the first foundation I've used that doesn't give my face a rose tint like all the other foundations out there for people with red tones in their face. This is also the first foundation I've used that not helps cover up my blemishes, but does not make my break outs worse! I got adult acne in my early 20's and every foundation I used seemed to make it worse. I stopped wearing make up all together for a while until a friend introduced me to BE.  What I don't like is that this foundation will bring out how dry your skin is. I recommend doing a light exfoliation every couple of days and use a good moisturizer. During the winter I use the BE foundation primer to help hide my winter dry skin."

The Korres seems more sheer on the one hand and yet builds for better coverage on the other. The Light shade is perfect all over my face and jaw line, whereas with the BE I needed to use a lighter tone on my jawline/neck if I had blemish to cover. I also used the Summer Bisque concealer powder under my eyes. With the Korres product I use one thing for all three purposes...so I've switched. Sorry BE!"

When I went into the store, a consultant suggested I use one of the synthetic Sephora foundation brushes. As opposed to the BareMinerals brushes, that have natural bristles, the synthetic brushes do not absorb as much makeup into the bristles, keeping more at the bottom as you apply it to your face. This gives you much better coverage. (The synthetic brushes also don't harbor as much bacteria.) Try it!"

But i do think that for the days when i want just a little bit of coverage and just an even skin tone, this would be perfect. It feels really light on the skin as well. Only thing to keep in mind is that it is a light coverage therefore, if you pack alot of it on hoping that itll turn into a medium coverage, you're wrong. The powder just sits on the face. So, with that being said, i did like it, just for those lighter days."

Now I use only this foundation (the shade Fair is great for my porcelain skin; the supposedly pink undertone is minimal, thankfully), generally with a concealer brush, and spot apply it where I think I need a bit of coverage.  My skin really has improved! I was using various high-end compacts and liquid foundations, and I didn't think they were making my skin any worse, but since quitting those and exclusively using this it has improved so much that they must have been irritating it without my even realizing it.  Seriously, my neighbors randomly complimented my perfect porcelain complexion -- and my first instinct was to tell them, Oh, no, it's makeup... before realizing I wasn't wearing much of it at all.  I will say that I apply it as needed with the brand's concealer brush, and only this brush gives me an appropriate amount of control and coverage.  I do dislike that it is extremely hard to get the last bit of product out of the container, and I feel the packaging itself is a bit misleading in terms of how much is in there.  But it's worth it, and I keep repurchasing, and my skin keeps improving, meaning I use less over time, and I can go longer without NEEDING to buy it... and so on.  * * As an aside, when I got cocky and decided to not wear ANY on my face, not even under my eyes, everybody at work asked if I was sick. So my judiciously applied dots of this DO still make a difference. :)"

I ended up first buying only the BB cream but it just did not have the same effect with other powder foundations. I finally got the bareminerals foundation and immediately remembered how incredible it was! It totally evens out all redness in my face and leaves me with an airbrushed, flawless finish! It is absolutely the best foundation I have ever used. Usually I am turned off my powder foundations but this one disappears once on my skin and you can't even tell it is a powder. As soon as I started using it, people immediately began to compliment me on my make up, even men, and bareMinerals is responsible! I still use this in combination with the smashbox BB cream and together they provide full great coverage. My skin gets more oily around my nose, chin, and forehead throughout the day, and even sweating all day long as a ballet dancer this foundation lasts! I would HIGHLY recommend this foundation however would suggest trying it out in store first to find your proper shade. No complaints."

At first I thought it was way to expensive for what it was, especially just being a powder. After using it for almost two years now, I cringe at the thought of going back to any other kind of foundation! BM not only covers up any pimples, scars, or any uneven skin tone that I may have, but it is super lightweight and doesn't cause me to break out more, like most other makeup would. No makeup is actually good for your skin, but if there is one kind out there that is, I would say this would have to be it. If you apply too much, I can see how the primer, foundation, and then mineral veil might look cakey. The trick is to find a nice balance between it all and not put too much on. I always end up going through the meneral veil before using all of my foundation. And if I have a certain spot I'm trying to cover up, I use a small dab of concealer on it, and then I use my BM to lightly cover that. If you buy the right shade for your skin and apply it apprrppriately, this stuff will make you look flawless. :-)"

I think it looks best blended with a dense powder brush. What I love the most is that it doesn't transfer to clothing, it absolutely stays put. I can hug my boyfriend without worrying I'll leave makeup on his shirt. It feels weightless and comfortable like you aren't wearing anything. The cons: doesn't blend well with fingers, packaging can be messy if you're not careful not to spill, and it does look dry on wrinkled areas, such as tiny creases around the eye. Not perfect, but pretty darn close."

It makes my skin look flawless and smooth. I have a slight problem with redness; a mild case of rosacea, but this foundation covers it almost entirely and gives a look of perfection. This product has never caused my skin to break out and has never felt like it is clogging my pores. It does not look cakey either. Once it is applied I don’t really see or feel that it’s on; my skin just looks better. This foundation is easy to use and quick to apply. The one and only problem I have with it is that powder tends to fly everywhere during the application process; but it can be dusted off quickly and this is something minor that I am willing to overlook since this foundation works wonders for my skin. I have tried 3 other powder foundations and this is my favorite one that I have repurchased several times. I highly recommend it, my skin feels and looks good after using this product."

It is the only foundation I found that I did not need to change which formula I used when the seasons change. I am very faired skin with pink undertones. Most foundations are either to yellow or to pink. I'm tired of make-up artist telling me to buy a foundation that has yellow undertones to neutralize my undertones, because the yellow makes me look yellow. I use fairly light, which has neutral undertones and looks amazing on me. I receive several compliments on how nice and natural my skin looks. When I tell people I have BE on, they're always amazed.  If you're new to BE I recommend playing with the foundation before you put it on an run out the door. The foundation tends to go on with medium-heavy coverage. The foundation blends easily, but if you apply to much pressure with the brush you're going to get a huge concentration of powder in that spot.  As with all powder foundations, it can bring out your flaws. If my skin is dry (especially around my eyes) it seems to accent those areas. I use an exfoliating sponge on my face twice a week and remember that during certain times of the year I may need to change my moisturizer ."

I find the coverage is rather light, but since I’m just looking to even out my skintone, rather than cover up a lot of stuff, that’s not an issue. That said, I find I can also dab a little extra on blemish or dark circle and it’ll cover it up almost as well as concealer, so I imagine you could keep applying it for a heavier effect.  It also wears pretty well throughout the day. I work long hours, and bike-commute in a semi-tropical climate, and it still looks pretty good when I get home at the end of the day.  It seems to agree with my skin very well. When I was travelling over Christmas, I even left it on overnight a couple of times and never got a blemish or irritation (not that that's ever a good idea!) The only thing is, it will show up on any dry, flaky skin, so exfoliate and moisturize first if that's an issue for you.  I would recommend getting their special foundation brush, or something similar, to appy it with. I don't have one, and I've been alternating between a makeup sponge and my big powder brush, but I feel like both are using more product for less coverage than the correct brush would.  Overall, I can't imagine that I'll ever want to try another foundation again. This one is pretty much perfect."

Everyday I apply underneath my eyes into the v-area on my cheeks, it works wonders hiding under eye darkness.

It doesn't cake on like traditional power, even when you need to load it on on days you feel like you need a little extra coverage. I've used this for years, and I've tried it all - liquids, BB creams, pressed powders, traditional foundations, etc. The key to really getting the most out of this is to make sure you're choosing the right shade. BM does a good job of giving you a wide range of shades to choose from - it's just a matter of getting it right. I have light, but not fair, skin - with neutral to pink undertones, and I was matched to Medium Beige. My friend is darker than me, but has very yellow undertones, and was matched to Light. It boggled our minds in the beginning, but after using seeing clearly how well it matched our natural skintones, we knew knowing our undertones had a lot to do with picking the right shade. The best thing to do is have someone (or 2) help you out in the store. Also, if you're trying to debate whether you should get matte or original, I tried matte out, and was willing to stick with it until it ran out - turns out, I returned to original. I have oily skin, but all the matte did was go on matte, but it didn't help reduce any oil. It kinda got rid of the glow BM is usually so well known for. On top of that, the colors are just SLIGHTLY different (BM claims this also), but not to a point where it's too noticeable. The original already did well not getting oily throughout the day, so it definitely was better than the matte in all aspects. Love this and can't switch to anything else!"

But I'm fair Irish with pink undertones and I believe It's the fairly light shade that works well for me. There is a shade for each skin tone and it's worth making sure you get the perfect one. I returned medium originally because it's too golden. The only drawback is that it's a messy affair using and storing this product but I just keep a paper towel under the pot while I'm using it and let it collect the dust and then throw it out when I'm done. You could also just wipe away the dust with a square of TP or whatever, but no matter how much you try to keep clean, there will be a bit of the powder strewn around. That's not from any bad design really, just the nature of the product. It doesn't dry out over the day and stays put pretty well. I love that I can brush it on easily all over my face or quickly on just areas I want which makes it easy and pleasant to use. No washing hands and blending perfectly with fingers or sponges.

And by right I mean normal skin that isn't overly dry or oily.  Pros: -Lightweight -Feels like you're wearing nothing -Healthy ingredients -Lasts forever so you don't have to keep throwing it out after 3+ months  Cons: -horrible for dry skin. it emphasizes every bit of flakiness and doesn't blend well over dry skin. -horrible for oily skin. does nothing for shine and you CANNOT touch your face because it WILL rub off on your hands. it's ridiculous. Same with itching. If you itch your face, the foundation comes off under your fingernails and it's gross. -the coverage could be better. i'd say it's about a light-medium coverage. I have dark acne marks and it's doesn't cover them up very well. the same with redness.  My final take: I only recommend this is you have normal skin with no major oily/dryness and need something with lighter coverage. (honestly if that's the case, you'd probably just be better off with a tinted moisturizer.) It's not necessarily a BAD foundation, it just isn't versatile. After I started acne medication, my skin has been really out of whack and unfortunately, it isn't compatible with this foundation anymore. Now I have to find a new Holy Grail foundation :'( Blehh."

I bought this because I had heard all of the great reviews for it, and it sounded like it would be perfectly suited for my skin. I have no idea what went wrong, but after using it, I developed some of the worst acne I have EVER had on the sides of my face and on my forehead. Aside from that, I do have to give it some credit where it's due. I managed to cover up a lot of my acne scars and acne (even that which it had created), and also covered dark circles well. The only issue I did notice was that it did start to oxidize a little bit, but I think that might have had something to do with the brush I was using at the time as well.

As I read more about Bismuth Oxychloride, I decided the look wasn't worth the allergy and abrasiveness on my skin. I switched to Merle Norman's mineral make-up that lacked the Bis.Ox. ingredient. It looked beautiful, but never as natural as BE.  In any case, I am stoked they came out with their Matte Foundation that lacks the Bis.Ox. My skin is very different from college, I am a bit oilier with mild acne since going off birth control, however, BE Matte has given me the most natural finish without the irritation. MUFU has an incredible liquid foundation, but there is something so natural about BE minerals. I recommend the Matte as opposed to the original based on my experiences, thus the two star rating."

I have aging skin (age 51) and most liquid or cream foundations no longer work for me, either looking mask-like or feeling heavy on my skin, settling into those fine lines, etc. BareMinerals gives me excellent coverage and even luminosity, without feeling heavy on my face. At first I was a little nervous about the application method (swirl brush in product, tap off excess, then apply in circular motion to skin) and thought it would take me longer to apply than traditional foundation. Instead I discovered that with just a little practice, it actually goes more quickly because the coverage is great--no need to keep applying like I used to with liquid foundation---one pass with bareMinerals is all it takes for great coverage for me, but you can build coverage if you need to. Also, no worries about later finding an unblended bit of foundation on my jawline or wherever, which I sometimes encountered with liquid and cream foundations. The only thing I don't like is that after a few hours of wear, it can start to look a bit shiny on the more oily spots of my combination skin--maybe I will try the matte formula next time. Just the same, I am a convert and will be trying the mineral veil next."

I've been using the same Medium and Medium Tan shades since the beginning. Use the Medium in the winter and Medium Tan when am tan in the summer. I would recommend this to anyone because it looks natural and the best part is that it doesn't irritate the skin. Don't be afraid to go to a Sephora and try different shades and see which you like best. I'd suggest setting the makeup using a water spray like Evian as I find that a few minutes after the application the color looks even better. That's because the natural oils in your skin will give you such a lovely glow which would be mimicked by the water spray when trying to choose one."

I've tried various shades, and I'm constantly amazed how even the ones that are wrong for my skin color still make my skin look great. Something about the powders instantly warms and shapes your face.  Medium tan was the perfect match for my skin, so I use that as an all over foundation. Golden Medium was a little too bright for all over use, so I use it to highlight my cheek and brow bones. Medium Beige always seemed too ruddy for my skin, but after a lot of experimentation, I now mix it with my Hard Candy bronzer for the perfect shade to define my cheeks, jawline, and forehead."

I love the finished look of this - your skin glows and doesn't make you look powdery or matte which I hate when certain make-up's do. In Winter, when my skin tends to get dry, this doesn't accentuate the dry areas, thankfully. Just don't overdo it, it does cake up. Very, very little really works. Plus, this does not make me break-out! Now...the only flaw I found in this is that, indoors, your skin looks amazing. But outdoors...my skin looks a little less amazing. I don't know why. The coverage is about light to slightly medium. You'll need concealer to cover up imperfections, as this won't. I recommend this to people with good to average skin people, as I noticed when I have a break-out, this isn't my go-to foundation. Overall, I really like this foundation though."

My skin without this makeup is dull, with the occasional blemish, lots of blackheads on my nose and chin, and redness around my nose and mouth-- in short, not too pretty! However, with this makeup, I always get compliments on my skin! It feels so lightweight and is not at all greasy. A couple drawbacks are that it can be messy if you accidentally drop it, and that it transfers quite easily and might not last all day if you have really oily skin-- both of which I am willing to live with for the flawless finish this foundation gives!"

When it just wasnt working, I went back to liquids and/or other powder foundations that only created oil slicks and clogged my pores, causing breakouts. As soon as I went back to this, the breakouts cleared up. And that's what happens every time I try a different foundation. Found a genius lady who helped me find the 1 perfect shade (that looked too dark in the pot to my eye but ended up being perfect on my skin) and I haven't gone back. Because it's so easy to apply, I sometimes put too much on and have to back off a little. Simple application. Takes very little time. Foundation doubles as concealer. Amazing coverage.

I was also really impressed by the color selections, because many lines of foundation don't have every undertone like BE does (it's hard to match my pale yellow/olive skin).  Anyway so I bought it right away and gleefully put it on as soon as I got home, admiring myself in the mirror. After a little time went by though I found that my face was feeling kind of weird and itchy, and you can't scratch it cause you don't want to mess up the makeup! After it almost felt like it was burning, I googled bare minerals itchy and discovered that a lot of people have this reaction to mineral makeup because of the ingredient Bismuth Oxychloride. Sadly, I had to return it, BUT I just found out that the matte formula does not contain bismuth, so I'm going to give that a try instead."

So embarassing and annoying when you're at work and by the end of the day, you look like you put on cheap drugstore foundation..  Also this thing just looks so fake... No amount of moisturizing, priminng, touch up powder afterwards can detract from the fact that you have obvious makeup on.

When I apply it, I really have to work at covering my more severe blemishes. Also, I get shiny towards the afternoon and it wipes off when i am dancing or running. However, this foundation is still really good. It provides a full coverage look, but it is still natural. You can't really tell that there's anything on my face, but my skin still looks better than it did before! I put it on over an acne moisturizer.  Overall, I would recommend it. It proides nice coverage, even if it comes off after a while."

I do love BE when used with bisque, and mineral veil (it's a process) in real life. However as a stay at home mom, I don't have time for touch ups, and this just doesn't have the staying power that a lot of liquids have. It looks so natural in real life, but it just doesn't photograph that well. You'll notice on the red carpet make up artists are usually using a liquid because mineral make up just doesn't cut it. In our facebook overexposed culture, I don't want to have to wear a different foundation each time I'm taking a picture! It's the biggest downside for me - which may sound stupid, and I understand the natural look in real life, because it looks like you aren't wearing makeup. That also can be a disadvantage. It may be my love of that airbrushed look that pulls me away. I do usually have this to throw on, especially on beach days or when I'm just at home. However I always have a liquid in my bag for longer days, evenings out/ any time pictures are involved. If you have naturally good skin - this is perfect. But with my combination, oily, dry spots, uneven marks on my chin - I just can't rely on this in every situation. Overall it's a good foundation sometimes."

I used to try this foundation back from 3 years ago, and it looks horriable on me, caky and just sit on top of my face; and everytime i went to sephora, i just stay away from BE line because of the bad 1st impression; But 2 months ago, I decided to pick it up to just give another try even though i had very low hope; I bought the starter kit which comes with brush and foundation, primer. Be honest i don't even know why i have courage to buy it because that date my skin was having some ace problem and looks like i will have allergy or something because of my period was coming; I put this foundation on and went to work the second day; i got 1st compliment from my client saying  i have such a nice skin OMG, i know it must be the foundation it is working; at the end of the day, i didn't feel any dryness at all and it just keeps looking good; That night i washed my face, my pimple on my faces were gone; i couldn't believe the 2nd time i try this product, it now just works for me; In order for convincing myself to keep it, i used it for continuous of 2 weeks when the whether was about near 100 degree; The foundation just looks Good on me even when i sweat; Now i guess maybe i am using the right brush to apply BE foundation; then immedicately i pucahse another Set from online because i love it so much; i know some people have reaction to the BE foundation, but luckily so far i don't; I think the starter kit is really good to try because it comes with everyting you need; I think i will keep using it and i will repurchase and try more of their products; By the way i have sensitive, dry skin; Stuff that doesnt work for me if i put it on, I will have reaction in 1 or 2 days; the shade i use is Light. I am a BB cream addidit, now I have been using this foundation constantly because it is so light that i don't feel anything when i put it on; I also use Nars pure radiant tinted moisturizer 1st and then concealer, then apply the BE foundation on the top, it works great for me; I don't use the primer come with it because it dries my skin; I will recommend to my friend to try;"

Get the matte if you get shiny/oily as the day goes on as this formula does not cover up shine at all. My favorite thing about it is that you can choose how much coverage you want on a given day and it always looks invisible. I use a minimal amount for work and then concealer plus a bit more powder for evening for a more flawless look. Everybody tells me it looks like I'm not wearing any makeup, and that's the idea! This is not necessarily for you if you need to cover every bit of discoloration or blemish to leave the house."

I've got fair skin that tans to a medium in the summer, so I switch between two colours: Fairly Light and Light. I really like that it's got a bit of SPF for daily protection. Everyone should try this. Definitely handy to have in your makeup kit. Also great for travel, since it's not liquid. I can have my regular foundation with me whenever.

Anyway, 10 years later, I've not used another powder foundation since. It's enhanced the best parts of my skin while minimizing imperfections. I literally have no idea what I would do if Bare Escentuals/Minerals went out of business. It can cover simple, faded scars to major blemishes like nothing and there's not been one girlfriend of mine who I've introduced it to who hasn't absolutely died and changed to it immediately - girlfriends of ALL skin types and tones.  It's great because' it's perfect for day-to-day wear and doesn't sit on your skin and make you look all makeup-y, and at the same time you can use a concealer brush to cover particularly unsightly spots with extra powder to hide them completely.  I always reorder before I runout because I simply can't be without this stuff.  I would suggest visiting your local Sephora though before buying (if you've not bought it before) to get them to match it perfectly to your skin tone because once you're matched perfectly (they've got ALL shades) you're set. As with any foundation, it obviously looks garish if the color's off."

I'm very picky about things on my face and this was comfortable.

I have been a loyal customer to bareminerals foundation for almost a year now, however, bareminerals isn't all that it portrays itself to be on tv, advertisements, and in the over enthusiastic sales associates that pressure you to buy these products. The make up itself can deliver the ever elusive full coverage at a moderate price, BUT if you have an oily complexion, I'd advice you to look elsee where. Flawless makeup is possible, and I never advice women too settle for anything less than what they're worth. This is probably phenomenal for those of dry or normal complexion, but if you're oily, try makeup forever."

I decided to try something besides bareMinerals for the first time and was directed to Lauren Mercier's Mineral Powder Foundation. It looked ok in the store however, after a month I was getting itchy on my jaw line, routinely getting pimples and looking faded. Which is why I have finally returned to bareMinerals.

So happy that I continued to use it because at first it did make my skin break out but that is completely normal in any product that is suppose to clear your skin. Your skin needs to purge all the crud before the beautifulness comes out.  I love this over Diorflash airbrush make up even and that stuff is 3 times more expensive. I kept using it during special occaions but have now realized that this ultimately just looks better in pictures since it has such a flawless finish. I will always use this and have given up foundation forever.  Use it over some Smashbox primer and you're good to go. On special occasions and on Saturday party nights, I will use the make up forever HD High Def powder to set it and it lasts all night (just a little oil blotting an hour or two in).  Just overall great coverage, thankful for the SPF, and looks amazing in pictures. Even used this before my very first half marathon and by the end of the race I had about 30 pictures of just me sprinting and I still looked great :)... hey, just sayin (here's the pic to prove it!)

Now that I'm no longer 20 something I don't need help looking older.  About a week ago I went back to Sephora and purchased the original formula again. I have received a lot of compliments on my skin this past week! Everyone tells me that I look younger and wants to know what my secret is.

Not to mention, it has sunscreen in it, which I have put to the test (I burn very easily)! I really like using Benefit's Erase Paste to cover redness, blemishes, or blotchy spots first, then top everything off with this. My only complaint is (as with ANY foundation I have found) that I am super fair, and the lightest shade is still not completely right -- so I mix in a little of my favorite transparent loose powder or even the Mineral Veil is okay. And I definitely love the new packaging of this foundation, with the twist-top -- a lot less messy and certainly less wasteful! Awesome!"

The matte formula felt heavy on my face, and creased in lines I never knew I had. The biggest thing I look for in a foundation is that it feels light on my face. This was definitely that, no matter how much of it I put on. Normally I wear sheer coverage, just enough to even out my skin tone. I don't really need much more than that. This does a fantastic job, and the finish is a beautiful glow. I was worried that this would make my face shiny and look overly done (I had a friend who wore this and it looked awful. Maybe it was something she wore with it) but the end result is that my face looks amazing. Fresh and dewy (I never thought a powder foundation could give me a dewy look!). Here's the best kicker: when I drink alcohol, my face gets beet red. One time I decided to try and cover it up with this. Holy moly, did it ever cover. FULL COVERAGE ON A FULL RED FACE. The best part, alcohol dehydrates your skin, and normally anything I put on top of my face after having some alcohol in me results in the nastiest foundation application but this never settles into any lines, or accentuate any dryness. Would buy this over and over (but one container lasts so long I don't need to worry about that for a while)"

You will get the best pay off and coverage with moisturized skin, applying this to a dry complexion is no good - I personally neglect primer, but don't seem to need it with this foundation. It is exceptionally blend-able and versatile. It will give your skin a natural look, and feel. No cakey-ness or greasiness. One of my complaints though (because I don't believe in a perfect product) is that in a humidity heavy environment, this foundation can increase shine dramatically so. That could be attributed to my combination skin type, or my neglect for a primer that helps keep things matte. If you're looking for more matte finish, try out bareMineral's matte foundation instead - some people really like it, I personally feel I do not get enough coverage with the matte.  Overall: I recommend this foundation for people who don't like applying heavy foundations, but want to even out their skin tone. It wears long, too!"

I've found that a lot of liquid foundations (even with primer and set with powder) just disappear by mid-day with my skin (oily). I've been trying bareMinerals for probably 4 months, starting with the matte foundation. I've found that for oily skin a powder foundation like this one has much better staying power. The matte formula is very matte but to the point that it looks very fake at the beginning of the day. The original foundation formulation, on the other hand, looks very natural and youthful, even at full coverage, you just have to apply a small amount at a time, buff and build, it takes some practice. It does have a tendency to settle into fine lines, even with primer, so I keep away from the undereye area and use a creamy concealer there instead.  So far this foundation has done wonders in terms of not breaking me out! I would recommend a temporary switch to this foundation to anyone who thinks their makeup might be breaking them out.  I do miss the ability to blend cream blush and highlight on top of a liquid foundation, but the staying power and lack of breakouts make it worth it to me.  Also, sorry bare escentuals, but almost any other brand of brush is nicer than the brushes that they're selling. I use ecotools."

A month ago, this lady I work for gave a a brand new Foundation kit which she ought two of, and luckily she was my shade.After having it laying around for a while I decided it wouldn't hurt to give it a try. I freaked out and called my grandma to tell her I was officially a fan. So far it's had to bad effects on my skin. It's long lasting and with a good moisturizer/BB cream beneath it, along with a natural looking blush, it is perfect for a no-makeup makeup everyday look.

One thing to keep in mind though -- less is more with this foundation. With a good foundation brush you should need very little to get the coverage you need. Apply a little at a time, and build."

My flaking is still visible, but reduced, and the redness and unevenness disappear without hiding all my freckles and color or looking caked. I use the Summer Bisque concealer for faster results, but the foundation does conceal perfectly well when layered. The only drawback is the messiness and it's well worth it!

BUT. if you have DRY skin like moi, this is not for you in the winter time. i reeeeealllyyyy wanted to use this in the winter but it looks cakey and just shows the dryness in my skin (which i want to hide). so if you have dry skin, only use this in the summer, thats what i do. i suggest applying this product with the sephora collection mineral powder brush #45, thats what i do :D (again.) haha i really suggest this foundation, you wont be dissapointed :_"

I didn't like the shine of the original version and stopped using it, but went back to it when the matte version was introduced. I loved the way it kept my oily nose shine free for longer than anything I'd used previously. I thought I'd finally found the product I would stick with. However, once I began using it on a daily basis, I noticed that my skin was constantly itchy and uncomfortable and I always found myself looking forward to getting home to wash it off. I can't stand being able to feel my foundation! At first I thought it was just the way my skin was, since I am prone to itchiness just about everywhere. One day I decided to try using a regular foundation and noticed that I didn't have the itchiness or the heavy foundation feel problem - I could actually wear something and not feel it! So while I loved the coverage of the BE matte, I had to give it up. It's just not for me. I also have to say that I found the packaging really inconvenient and messy. I am on the go all the time and hauling around the jar of foundation and mineral veil, plus a brush, was a real hassle and made mid-day application problematic. Why can't it be in a compact like other powders? I tried the refillable brush version twice in hopes that this would solve the problem, but I could never get the product to come out enough to actually create coverage - and I bought 4 of them thinking that maybe I had just been unlucky and gotten ones with defects. All in all I'd say that I gave it a fair shot, but had to move on."

She also mentioned something about there being 2 kinds - one that has a matte finish, and one that is a little more glowy (I got the latter).  It is a really light powder, and achieves exactly the effect I was going for. The package design is wonderful, and has a little turn-click mechanism that traps the powder in when you're not using it.

I also used this same foundation on my mother for her wedding and the before and after results are amazing. She looked about 10 years younger when I used the whole routine on her!!!!"

I tried other methods of applying this foundation, and the same exact thing happened. Nothing else changed in my skincare or makeup routine, so I know that the new pimples were caused by Bare Escentuals bareMinerals foundation.  The other issues that I had with this foundation is that it leaves the skin looking abnormally sparkly, NOT naturally dewy. No matter how much I blended, it looked like I had foundation on. The color selection is also VERY orange-peach based. I have yellow-neutral undertone in my skin, and I purchased 3 different colors in BE but still could not achieve a good color match, even when I tried various mixes of the 3 colors together.  There are better mineral foundations offered on Sephora.com. I really did want to like BE, but couldn't for the above mentioned reasons."

In my life I can say I tried almost every fluid and powder foudation there is on the market since I became a teenager. Bare minerals is a mineral powder, it covers every pore and every blemish without even showing on your skin. My face looks natural, the layer of powder is thin but it hides what I want to be hidden and doesn't leave on my skin thick mask that I could feel and everyone could see on my face. After I tried it for a first time I could not believe how well it covers and that I can't feel wearing makeup on my face and most imprtant how could I live without it so far. Strongly recommend to every lady either you have very uneven skin tone or you just need to add a perfect glow to your face. I also use the other powder-one you apply under your eyes (great to appy with a thin brush on your most reddish spots as well before applying foundation). You may think initially it is not there but if you compare another eye that you didn't appy it yet to-you can see the difference!!! Simply love it!!!!!!!!!!!"

I have BAD acne scars around my chin/mouth as well as scars on my cheeks from doing a face plant into a patch of poison ivy a few years back and this covers it COMPLETELY without all the excess buildup of other products and minimizes the risk of looking cakey! It doesn't wear off during the day unless you are bad about touching your face.  For $26, this is a steal! I was using a drugstore powder that was half the price but didn't have the ability to last all day like bareMinerals does so I was constantly touching up throughout the day (aka: wasting product)."

Fourth, it covers everything even my mom's rosacea, but it has to be reapplied throughout the day. I've recently decided not to use it anymore, and I will tell you why. First, it rubs off very easily. It just sits on top of your skin and will rub off of your coat collar or shirt easily. Second, it needs to be touched up during the day (at least for my oily skin). Third, once it wears for a few hours it seems to sink into little wrinkles or accentuates them more. Finally, at the end of the day you can literally scrape it off your face with your fingernail. At the beginning of the day, it feels light and sheer. At the end of the day it starts to feel cakey. Maybe it's just not great for my oily skin. I have started using a tinted moisturizer now, and it seems to wear better throughout the day."

It really helped me fake it for a while. I keep using this stuff now because I hate liquid foundations and I don't know what else to use in its place, but I'm really not a fan anymore."

The makeup looks very natural. Also, the makeup really lasts.  Before switching to bareMinerals I used to use a liquid foundation, concealer, and powder foundation so that my face was literally caked. I received the bareMinerals starter kit and LOVED it. After using up the goods in the kit, I tried to go back to the cosmetic aisle goods, but there was no comparison."

However, in the past few years, other favorite brands have introduced their own versions, as a result, I have opted to use the Korres mineral make-up and prefer that one.  Recently the two Sephora stores nearest me were sold out of the Korres foundation in my color, so I had to use up my old bareMinerals and even buy a new one since the two stores did not restock my color in time. My observations are that I will use this only until I find the Korres in my color.  The bareMinerals color closes to me (a Sephora staff member even tried the two closest shades on me to select the best color as it had been awhile since I last purchased this product), leaves me looking tan and I don't feel the coverage is as good as the Korres version.  So if I add more to create more coverage, then it looks like too much foundation. I have yet to try the Laura Mercier mineral make-up, but chose Korres because it is more natural.  Also, in my experience, the original version of this foundation works better for my skin, I was very much looking forward to the matte version as I have combination skin, but it left my skin looking too luminous, I felt it had to opposite effect of matte."

The coverage is natural-looking but still covers like a makeup should.  My skin is very oily, and I do need a touch-up part way through the day. For this I use the mineral veil. Blot with a tissue, TP, or rice paper and apply with the blush brush. It doesn't look cakey when it grabs the oily patches, and the color of the foundation holds well through blotting.  Try it!"

If you are used to liquid foundation, it may make awhile to get used to it. It doesnt seem to be covering at first, but you need to layer. My issue is, that you need alot of product to swirl on the brush to get a good application. Therefore, when its starting to run out, you just can't get a good application, you might as well be wearing nothing.

Definitely a great price for the quality and quantity of the product. I still prefer this original over the Matte, and I have tried both in a few different shades (I have 3 shades which I use throughout the year depending on the season/vacations) Great for individuals with redness.. the coverage is buildable, although it still may not be thick enough to cover individuals with severe acne or blemishes. I will say though that I am a firm believe that people with acne issues will see a reduction in their number of breakouts if they switch to this product and continue using for a few months."

And they both made me shiny half-way through the day. Now I bought bareMinerals in Fairly Light, and it's the PERFECT color!!! This is the best foundation I have ever worn! It lasts pretty much all day, depending on my activity I might have to do minor touch-ups. If I put more coverage on a blemish, it doesn't look unnatural or a different color from the rest of my face. Every other foundation would make under my eyes very dry and sometimes flaky, but I can use this foundation to cover up my dark circles as well. It's basically a foundation and concealer all in one. So convenient and I'm so in love :) I use the Handy Buki Brush and a small concealer brush and I'm good to go. The only time I broke out from wearing this foundation was when I forgot to wash my brush, but that was my own fault. I would definitely recommend this foundation!!!"

I also have very oily skin, which usually makes my makeup feel dirty after only a few hours, but this feels clean all day.

			"review_text": "This foundation is great for several reasons.  1 - Good for dry skin - t's great for my dry, flaky skin. I went through so many liquid and mousse and liquid to powder makeups and they all did the same thing to my skin - highlighted all the skin flakes so they were really obvious and noticeable. This is the first, and so far only, foundation that doesn't settle around dry skin flakes and make them stand out like little flags on my face.  2- Natural Looking - this foundation doesn't look cakey or overly fake on my skin. It looks really natural, even up close. A little goes a long way and people always tell me how lucky I am to have such NATURALLY even and beautiful skin. If only they knew!  3- Natural Materials - It's good for my skin. It doesn't clog my pores and I love that it's made of natural minerals and isn't harsh on my skin. I don't get breakouts from this, my skin stays clear and healthy. Very breathable!  I've used this for a while now and I can't imagine going to anything else. This is my very favorite foundation of all! Thank you Bare Minerals!"

I've found use the bare minimum and add more if you need it. It doesn't last long in humid climates especially if you are sweating but what foundation does. One thing I noticed is that it goes on much prettier if you wait 30-60 min after cleansing or if you use a really good moisturizer before applying."

I used YoungBlood mineral foundation for about a year and struggled with issues of poor coverage and the fact that it would wear off; however, I needed a mineral foundation that was good for sensitive skin. My mom introduced me to bareMinerals foundation and I've been using it religously for about 3 years now. It is amazing, gives great coverage, hides acne spots and other skin imperfections, lasts all day, covers my dark circles (which nothing else has been able to touch), and does not irritate my sensitive skin (pron to eczema). I prefer the original over the matte...I think you need more of the matte to achieve the same coverage, and I also love the slight amount of illumination that is in the original foundation. My only thing that I don't use from B.E. is their kabuki brush....I much prefer Sephora's mineral foundation brush #45 (I think thats the #). It is a much softer, better quality brush, and has a better and quicker coverage for the same, if not, less money."

I have used bare minerals for years, I've used both the original and the matte versions, and both are great! I actually currently use both, I apply the matte to my T-zone, and use the original to conceal under eye circles and redness around my nose, and also use the original on my cheeks which tend to be a bit drier. I use this foundation daily, and I go through one container about every year. I admit that I'm 27, and my skin issues are dark circles and fine lines, blotchy cheeks, and a some left over acne marks, and I mainly use this product with the concealer brush over problem areas and then lightly brush over my entire face after I've concealed (which I believe is the appropriate way to use this foundation if you watch the how-to videos). And I get full coverage. If you're using full-face full coverage, you might go through a container every 6 months (as my mom does). But if you are like the reviewer who said that a container only lasts her 1 month, you are probably misusing this product or using it on more than just your face. I really love these foundations and I feel I get great coverage and they last me quite a long time and are very affordable for me (even when I was a college student and completely broke). I just wanted to rave on them because I love them and I've recommended them to friends and family several times over the years! I use the shade fairly light, my mom uses light and my sister in law uses medium. I find that this brand has shades do well with a range of ethnicities. P.S. The Sephora starter kit is definitely the way to go if you don't have any of the bare minerals brand brushes these are essential to putting on the product the correct way, plus it comes with warmth and the mineral veil, both of which are great products!"

The foundation works very well concealing blemishes, redness, and dark spots (for my fair skintone, fairly light is a great match when lightly applied in a tapping motion and slowly building from there).

I need yellow base and fair/light. I use golden fair, best match, but still maybe too light. I would be nice to be able to mix, but you can't open the container.

Having acne-troubled skin, I was actually extremely skeptical that a powder foundation could provide the coverage I need and not look pasty. When I got married, I inquired to have my makeup done at one of the best salons in our town. They only use Bare Minerals makeup, so I set up a trial appointment to make sure I didn't look hideous. Well, it was the best that makeup has ever looked on my face, and I've been hooked on Bare Minerals ever since.  If you've never used it before, I would suggest getting a professional who knows the product to show you how you can apply it the first time. I'm pretty intuitive about figuring out the best way to do things on myself, but a lot of others are not, and, for this foundation, HOW you apply it is much more important than traditional foundations.  As a quick tip, buff the stuff to death on your face. For like 5 minutes, I'm not kidding. It mixes together better with your natural oils, and I find that the more I buff, I'm not buffing stuff away from my blemishes, it seems to cover them better (which sounds counter-intuitive, I know!). After that, if you need to spot-correct, you can do that with the concealer brush and foundation. I usually have to do that a little bit. 99% of the time I haven't used a separate concealer since I started using this stuff, which I find amazing.  Good luck!"

I have fair skin and the lightest shade is the perfect match, which is awesome because I usually have a hard time finding a light enough shade. When I use this foundation I can control the amount of coverage so I don't even have to use concealer with it. I use a tad all over the face and more where I have acne scars. Since I've started using this product my breakouts have dramatically decreased and my skin looks more radiant on a daily basis. I applied this foundation at 5:30am and it lasted all through 11pm without caking or fading or losing any coverage, amazing. With MAC Studio Fix I used to have to re-apply the foundation ever couple of hours, this stuff is much less maintenance. It has improved my quality of life.

I finally found my perfect shade. In the summer, I mix it with Medium to accommodate a slight tan. In the dead of winter, I can mix it with Fair or Fairly Light to make it paler and a little more ethereal. The formula, of course, is what bareMinerals is known for. Light, weightless, with as much coverage as you want. Buff lightly for a sheer effect, buff a little more for more coverage, use it with the concealer brush to perfectly cover blemishes or discolorations. You definitely want to use a good moisturizer under any SPF 15 Foundation. Without at least a primer, it gives a little of a dry-skin effect and can make pores more visible. A layer of moisturizer prevents that from happening."

It has buildable coverage, so you can always customize your look. And it's natural, and is actually good for your skin. It claims to improve your skin over time, and it truly does. I saw an improvement in the texture and clarity of my skin after a couple of months of regular use. The only problem one might have with the foundation is the staying power. You MUST, I repeat MUST, use a primer with this foundation (my personal favorite is Hourglass Mineral Veil). Without a primer, this foundation doesn't last long, but using a primer not only smooths and preps your skin for the application of foundation, but really ups the staying powder of your foundation by giving it something to stick too. I also recommend using a lightweight translucent powder to set it (I like the BE mineral veil or the MUFU HD Setting Powder). With these two tricks, your foundation should last for hours leaving your skin looking smooth and flawless. Must I say it again? This foundation is well worth the hype, leaving your skin with a flawless yet natural finish, it buffs in so smooth and creamy, AND it's good for your skin, what more could you ask for in a foundation?"

Anyway, it looks great, gives my skin a porcelain look and is too easy to apply to every be without. They also offer many variations of color from pink undertones to yellow, neutral, etc."

In New York, this foundation doesn't work for me at all. It looks cakey, leaves my skin ashen and grey, and just doesn't look good in general. But in LA, this works much better (I think due to changes in humidity and perhaps water hardness?) Over there, this sinks into skin, looks natural and flawless, and is soooo good for your skin. The only complaint in LA is that it does tend to get drying and can be cakey if you build the coverage a lot.  I think this is a great foundation for everyday use (work, etc), when you don't really care about looking spectacular and just want your skin to be healthy. I don't quite like it as much as liquid foundation for going out, however."

If you're a first time user it does take some getting used to - it IS a different look than liquid foundations - it DOES settle into pores and lines. However using this with a foundation primer, mineral veil or other invisible finishing powder (Laura Mercier is my fave) will take care of that issue. Invest in the brushes and especially the small concealer brush. Give it at least a week and change up the other products you use with it - you may not like the mineral veil or the blushes but that doesn't mean you can't wear the foundation."

Now, it isn't going to erase every single bump on your skin (especially if you are a teen like me with acne) but it WILL conceal redness and hide smaller bumps.

You need very very little, like so tiny, perhaps a pinch and a the right brush, big enough to allow blending with some firmness, and a brush that fits the sides of the nose, so you don't miss it. You have to work it in, otherwise it will sit on top of your pores, exposing them. It is great cuz it is very water resistant, lasts all day and does not come off on your clothes. SInce they added the golden light color I have come back, as the others were too pink based for me to use, as I am fair but with Rosacea, and I don't need anymore pink, need yellow. THis one is yellow based, perfect. SO A VERY LITTLE GOES A LONG LONG WAY. You want your freckles to show through, it makes skin better, not mask it with a heavy caking!

The feeling is very light and not gunky like liquid foundation. I have tried other brands of powder foundation and this is by far the best. Some have talc, which doesn't have coverage and feels weird. Some have sparklies in them. Not what I want in a foundation. This one is just right.

Despite trying various combinations of moisturizers & primers for the better part of a year, I found that having to buff in the foundation only accentuated dry spots/minor flakes. Also, if you are extremely oily, one of the ingredients that gives the luminous glow will make you look greasy. Of course you can blot or re-powder, but that may not be an option if you are in the midst of working. On a good note, I did not break out from the foundation, and this did look great during fall/spring."

This product is not for everyone but for me it is the most amazing thing that ever happened to me. I always was trying to figure out why my face was oily or super dry so I was trying different face washes but i noticed it was my make up. I didn't want foundation like mac (more of a stage make up I do love them though) or any cheep brand even though i ware cheap eyeliner and other things (hey they work) but I wanted something to last me and work so I went with this face make up. It lasts me for months so thats why I don't mind the price and it makes my face look porcelain and my uneven skin tone is very even I tried going to other ones after but I keep going back. But my skin is not like everyone else's so thats why I do get it when they say it does not work because one of my friends cannot ware it because it looks very powdery on her skin and very hard to match her tone. That will be my one complaint is that they dont have that many shades in between I always have to mix in Warmth but, other then that I love this make up and will never switch."

So make sure to moisturize really well prior to applying if you have dry skin.  Also, I'm sooo happy to know that this product has SPF protection and is approved the the Skin Cancer Foundation (check out their website for a list of Seal of Recommendation approved products)!

For a product that claims it's so gentle you can sleep in it and it's for all skin types, it's a load of ****!  Also if you have drier skin with some lines and wrinkles, go with liquid foundation rather than use this.

Like all other BE foundations, the coverage can be fine-tuned to your needs - a little bit buffed on in certain areas, or build up as much coverage as you'd like.  If you've never tried BE foundation, you are doing yourself an injustice. You have to at least try it! It's improved the quality of my skin incredibly and the foundation gives my face an incredible glow. No matter how sleep-deprived and literally depressed I am, people I run into in my building that I haven't seen for a while tend to say, Wow, you look great! and it's NOT because I've lost weight or anything :) Woo hoo BE!"

It covers and conceals, but reveals just enough so that I still look like ME.  One note- I have moderately dry skin even in summer, so I suggest using a good face moisturizer and giving it plenty of time to soak in before application for the most natural look--the powder foundation can make dry skin look more obvious without a good moisturizer, but I suppose that's true for any face powder."

The primer and a good moisturizer before use will help you out. If you have oily skin It's great because it is a matte foundation and if you want a healthy glow you can use BE Raidiant all over face color which is great for highlighting. I also use the Jade powder which is good to use all over the body for extra definition in legs, and collar bones. I also like to use it in my hair for a little bit of extra shine."

Look at the bottom you will see there is a lip/ groove going round the circumference of the base, use tweezers or similar to gently (I repeat gently or the powder will fly out every where) lift the bottom off....mix your shades, or refill your container...click the bottom back on, flip it over and hey presto, your done!

It completely covers my redness and makes my skin look healthy and clear. I will say the one thing when choosing a shade is don't be afraid to go darker than what you think you are. I'm Caucasian with a medium skin tone. I tan fairly easy but my skin doesn't look nearly as dark as the model shown. My advice would be to go into your local boutique or sephora and let them try different shades on you. I can say from personal experience that the right shade makes all the difference. I started out using medium beige, which completely washed me out and it didn't look natural. I then switched to golden medium which was still too light. Eventually I tried golden tan which was the perfect match. This product has honestly given me such a confidence boost and I'm no longer embarrassed for people to look at my skin."

I literally had to change all of my face makeup and skincare regime and it took my awhile to figure out what worked best for me out here. During the summer months this foundation actually looks amazing (although make sure you are applying it correctly or else it will look chalky/cakey). It stays on all day and it gives fantastic coverage while looking and feeling super natural, just like my own skin. I do use a primer underneath and that may help with the staying power and no splotching but it may be just fine on it's own--I have never used it sans the primer. I use Laura Gellar spackle but I also like Korres primer and I am going to buy that next.

However, my only qualm is that sometimes when there is a concentration of the product in one area, it tends to create a greyish tint. I asked the employees in the Bare Escentuals store about this and they told me it was because of the mica (a shimmering mineral that gives you the luminous finish) in the product. Now, I mix the Bareminerals matte with the original foundation to avoid that issue.  Another note: The original Bareminerals has a slightly pinker tint. while the Bareminerals matte offers a more yellow tint.

And liquid and mousse foundation makes my skin look greasy by the middle of the day (plus the liquid is messy!). I like cream to powder, but you can't really get light coverage with cream to powder - it starts off heavy.  THIS, though, is perfect. First of all, big props to the male associate at the Times Square store who helped me color match my skintone (I'm Golden Dark). Second of all, it has all of the benefits of the powder foundation without drying me out. Usually when I wear a full face of makeup (which is almost every day) by the end of the day I am running home, I can't wait to get the gunk off my face. But not this. Even though I wear the primer, this foundation and Mineral Veil...it feels light, like I'm not even really wearing makeup. And of course it doesn't make my face itch.  Not only that, but WOW does it look nice. I know it sounds gimmicky but it really does give you a natural luminosity. It makes my skin look smooth and beautiful and especially with the primer diminishes my pores to nothing. I also had two large whiteheads on my chin and tapped a little over my chin with the concealer brush (I got the get started kit). Of course they didn't disappear, but they were a lot less noticeable.  A note, though - if you've never tried before, go to your local Sephora and get your color matched or at least try it on your face. My facial color looks nothing like the picture of Golden Dark on this website. It looks really different in the jar and on your face."

I have super sensitive skin and am allergic to so many things, so I needed something natural. My skin does really well with the Bare Minerals Matte foundation. I tried the Original and had to return it because my skin was irritated by it (I was warned by the salesperson that my skin might not agree with the Original formula). But the Matte formula is great!

I have moderately oily skin and I look REALLY shiny after a few hours. Nothing a touch up, or some blotting papers won't fix. I have tried the matte formula and I really disliked it. I broke out, the color was NOT the same as the non-matte formula, and I thought the coverage was really cakey and unnatural. I do recommend using an oil absorbing lotion before application if you are combo/oily skinned. And the circular buffing motion is very important for even coverage.

Tried to buildup the foundation and it got a little cakey. I also dislike the messiness if the powder. The directions instruct you to shake the product into the lid and use the brush to apply.

While it's convenient and less messy, unfortunately, you can't ever get the last remaining foundation out of the jar and the lid won't come off at all.

She's been using it now for four years and has dry skin. She loves it.  The Fairly Light is a good shade but a smidge pink...however, I can wear it just fine. I think I'm the only one who notices the color. However, by adding a bit of the new shade Golden Fair, it creates a perfect match for my coloring.  I also found that I like to blend the original finish with the matte finish. Ever notice in photos that people who are not wearing make up still have a sheen to their skin? If you don't and you are standing next to them, it looks a bit odd. A blend of the two is a nice mix and looks natural, no matter how complete the coverage is."

Before I started using this regularly, I was completely against foundation due to all my bad experiences, but I needed something to cover the dark circles under my eyes when I'm not feeling well/overtired, so I got the BareMinerals Get Started kit because my best friend recommended it. This foundation is great. It doesn't feel like there's anything on my face. It doesn't break me out or irritate my skin (which nearly every other brand of make up has). It's long lasting -- I can put it on in the morning and it will easily last until the night. It looks incredibly natural and blends perfectly into my skin. It also gives my skin a nice glowing appearance. It covers up any imperfections quite well, and you don't need to use much so it lasts me a very long time. Because I use so little, the cost is probably just the same or less than using a drug store brand. It's so quick and easily to apply, too. This foundation has completely changed how I feel about makeup, and I'm really glad I gave it a try."

My skin is also very sensitive, and the only problem I have with this makeup is that sometimes the kabuki brush can give me little bumps on my chin/neck when blending...but they fade quickly and I am positive it is the bristles and not the makeup.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because it can get very messy and while I have been wearing it for several months now, I am just starting to get the hang of the swirl, tap, buff method.

I can't even feel it.I always feel hot with most of foundations and powders but I don't feel it with BE. You have to be careful with this product. It's loose powder so it tends to get messy but with some attantion you won't have any troubles. And honestly liquid foundations are much more messy. Also don't use too much! I need some practice before I got used to it but it's better to work the amout you have on the brush (and believe me you will have lots of powder on the brush even if you can't see it) than keep on reapllying and end up with cocky skin. My concern is it doesn't cover as good as ppl say but still it's a good coverage. If you have small brakeouts you will be very satisfied. Also it doesn't control oils as good as I thought it oud butstill it's better than everything I've tried before. What I like most of all is that it doesn't clog pores and removes easily with make up remover. I definetly recommend this product =) PS: Read instructions. It helps =)"

My routine consists of first putting on moisturizer and letting it soak in. Then I start by covering blemishes with the small brush, and then lightly going all over my face with the larger brush. Sometimes I follow with the mineral veil if I'm feeling like I want to look especially nice, but it isn't necessary day to day.

When I apply it under my eyes, it gathers in the corners near my nose and enhances my few wrinkles. It tends to separate on my nose (my friend has the same problem with it). We both have combination skin. It also separates on my chin and forehead which aren't very oily so it can't understand why it does this. If you want to use this product, I recommend that you use a lot of moisturizer first. I have also found that I have to carry it around with me for touch ups when it rubs off or separates. It's very good for covering blemishes and since it's drying, it helps dry out any pimples which makes them disappear faster."

What I like to do in the winter is use a tinted moisturizer fiirst and then apply a coat of bare minerals. My skin gets pretty dry in the winter, so this helps with the dryness. My only issue with bareMinerals is the brushes. They're soft at first, but even if you buy the special cleansing soap for the brushes, they're never as soft once you use them for awhile. I'd try another brand (my MAC brush has lasted awhile and is still soft)."

I find that a jar lasts a very long time for me, since I wear a rather minimal layer of foundation and am not a daily makeup wearer. I adore how easy Bare Minerals is to apply - not much blending or precision needed, just dust it over your face (and dust again if you want more coverage or see that you missed a spot).  My mom tried Bare Minerals because I liked it so much, and she loves it too. She's in her 60s but her students refuse to believe it - because her makeup is't heavy, caked, or cracked like the heavier foundation worn by other older women these teenagers have interacted with."

Pros: BE lets me customize how much or how little coverage I want, which is nice for days when my skin is not being cooperative. It's very easy to apply and can be done quickly, which is awesome becuase I can be running late, and still look put-together. Even just mascara with the foundation, warmth, & mineral veil is sufficient. Cons: BE is VERY drying to the skin. (Hence 4 instead of 5 stars.) I noticed a distinct difference in how dry my face was after I started using BE, but since I was able to address the issue by using more moisturizer, I kept using the BE. If you have really dry skin before using makeup, you may want to test this makeup in the 20-dollar trial before buying a full kit. The new containers that are designed to prevent spillage do a decent job, but are not foolproof, so you still need to be careful. Overall, I'm very pleased with BE, and will continue to use. I would definitely recommend this to friends."

I was also concerned that the makeup that I use to cover up the redness was looking fake and cakey.  This was just what I was looking for! It is unrealistic to look for a makeup that will cover up every single blemish and make your skin look completely uniform - if you're looking for something that is going to provide that level of coverage, you are not going to get natural looking makeup. I love that this evens out my complexion, and provides natural coverage. Does it even out every aspect of my rosacea? No. But it improves how my skin normally looks, and makes me feel great, as well as concealing the worst of my blemishes well.  It is not the fastest to apply, if you are using it correctly with the other products. It takes me a good 5 minutes, so if you are looking for something that has super quick application, this may not be your thing. Still, I would recommend you try it. Using this product as a concealer was fantastic, it is the most realistic coverage I have found so far. The click-lock system so far has been fantastic. I have been using this for two weeks, and have yet to get my makeup bag messy with the powder. I think you will be fine if you use common sense and make sure the product is properly closed before tossing into your bag. I have not found using this product to be too messy, no more than any other powder makeup.  I bought this as a part of a set, so I use it with mineral veil and the 'warmth'. and am extremely pleased! I do not think I will ever change this foundation, I love it.  I would definitely recommend this product!"

It lasts all day long and I can even tell when I'm at the gym at the evening that my skin still looks even after my workout.

I have classic combination skin -- very dry patches on my cheeks, and a very oily T-Zone -- and 98% of the time it gives me perfect, natural, even, and comfortable coverage...but the other 2% of the time, in that dead, cold, bone-dry portion of New England winters when my skin is rough and parched, it SOMETIMES (not all of the time) gives me cakey coverage. However, like I said, the OTHER 98% of the year, it is the BEST foundation ever; it breathes and doesn't just feel like a second-skin, it feels like YOUR skin...all while giving great coverage, and I feel good about putting something so natural on my skin. On an endnote, I've been reading some of these reviews that claim BE foundation made people break out horribly, to which I have two things to say: 1) Do remember that there is always a possibility to have an allergic reaction to anything you put on your skin (ie resulting in bumps and rashes that may look like acne), so ALWAYS do a test patch, and 2) ESPECIALLY with BE foundation -- which is not only brushed on, but buffed into, your skin -- you have to FREQUENTLY clean your brushes...I can't stress that enough! Even with the best foundation like BE, if you don't clean your brushes, you will be buffing old foundation, dead skin cells, oil, dirt, and bacteria onto your face which will make anyone break out...so clean your BE brushes to get the best result with BE foundation!"

I used to have clear skin up until a year or two ago, and didn't have a problem with it before. As for the makeup, I am making the switch to Everyday Minerals when I finish up this container. If I could give it 2 and a half stars, I would. But I couldn't, so I went with 2, because 3 would be too generous. :P  (Also, my mom said it left an oily sheen on her face by the end of the day.

Before I started using this product, I didn't have horrible skin, but I had a few breakouts every now and then, especially on my chin and around my mouth. Everything I tried was just worsening my slight acne. So I started using bare minerals every morning (and the trick is to apply light coverage with a kabuki brush, wait five minutes, and if you want more coverage, then apply more), and I was happy to find that my face wasn't oily or in need of a touch up at all by night time. Ever since I've used this product (about 5 months now), I've had super soft, clear skin. When I told my sister about this, she started using it too and it worked for her as well! Her skin is acne free and we both swear by this powder now. And the best part is, it looks like you don't have any foundation on and your complexion is naturally even - several people have complimented me saying this too. This is a must buy! :)"

I don't even really need foundation, to be honest, but I have some redness on my eyelids and discoloration and because my skin's so dry, I want to have that glow. So anyway, long story short, she put this on my face and I was sold! Haven't used any other foundation for my face since. People are saying Korres is pretty good but I don't really want to switch. It's like I've built a loyalty for this product.  Feels so light, gives my face a glow, one box lasts me at least 2-3 months. Covers under eye circles, blemishes, redness, pimples.

I also have very sensitive skin so I definitely have to do face mask and all that whenever I wear foundation all day (it clogs up my pores, even with primer etc).  Go for this! I highly recommend this if you have oily skin as well. I find that because of the cream/powder base it sucks up the oil in my skin, making it last all day even without primer. It looks really natural and blends in with my skin. Go into the skin and have an associate pick out the color for you. I was given the medium toned color even though my skin is really light.

I also could not fathom the idea of a powdered foundation properly covering up any blemishes. However, I received a mini trial sample with a kabuki brush in the Fairly Light shade, and decided to try it on even though I have a medium skin tone. To say I was impressed would be an understatement.  The coverage is simply flawless. It leaves your skin tone looking even and feeling smooth, and stays on even after applying blush and bronzer, something I feel most liquid foundations fail to do. It also gives you an overall NATURAL glow.  I first used an SPF lotion all over my face (Clinique's SPF 50) before applying bareMineral's original foundation. To get the most of the product, simply empty some of the power in the lid and twirl your brush on it. The foundation immediately catches on and then you can spread it across your face in a circular motion.  I felt that this product also absorbed the shine and left my face looking less greasy. I did not need to use a loose powder to get rid of it like I usually would. The blush I used after putting this foundation on was Make Up Forever's cream blush and the bronzer was Too Face'd Sun Bunny bronzer.  Although other reviewers say that the shades available are poor, I believe otherwise. It is better to use a lighter shade because it gives your skin a glow while also lifting the color a little. My skin also felt great, smooth and there were noticeably less blemishes on my face days after I used this product.  I am definitely going to purchase this product and use it as my main foundation. For the excellent quality, it is worth much more than $28 CAD!"

I have combination skin so I have a hard time finding a foundation that won't make my skin greasy or accentuate the dry spots and wrinkles, but this works wonders for my complexion. The only suggestions I have for anyone using this makeup is to be sure to exfoliate your face before applying it and use the BareEscentuals Baby Buki brush for the best results. I have noticed that if I have dry, flaky skin it stands out when I wear this, but if I exfoliate (facial cleanser on a washcloth is usually sufficient) my skin appears flawless and healthy. I love that it doesn't take much to get superior coverage that lasts all day. It is so clean and light that I am able to sleep with it on and not get any blemishes.

I tried BareMinerals and covered it okay. I was looking for something with a fuller coverage. I discontinued the use of this foundation for a whole year until my skin started to clear up again after I discontinued the IUD. This foundation is all I use now. I still need medium coverage for my scars that are slowly going away and this does the trick without making me look like I have too much on. I also recommend the bisque to cover up those red spots.

I've always been called high yellow, and, indeed, the Golden Medium shade seems to work well for me in general, but not ALL of my face is yellow, so the parts that are pinkish or tanned (like my nose or cheeks) tend to look a little strange until I also apply an All Over Face Color on them as I would blush (I'm actually mixing the two tones that came as a Valentine's Gift, which alone would be too dark and the other too pink, but together they worked fine-AFTER I got the hang of the application process).  If you don't REALLY want to use foundation, I recommend a tinted moisurizer (I do like the new Philosophy Hope in a Tinted Moisturizer) and perhaps a little B.E. Mineral Veil (I chose the B.E. Brightening Gold Duo), and skip this foundation or you might end up with more make-up layers (e.g. plus blush) than you're used to or desire."

One tip I have is to use a spot concealer on troubled areas (for me, pimples usually leave red marks that last about 3-6 months) I dot concealer on these spots first, then use medium beige foundation, warmth, and tinted veil. best ever!!"

I'm a 16-year-old who's struggled with problem skin since the age of 11 or so, and while the worst of it finished a year or two ago, I still get regular breakouts, especially hormonal ones. Before, I used just your basic L'Oreal liquid foundation, and honestly, I have NO idea what I was thinking, using it with my oily skin… I was at Sephora about 2 months ago, and decided to buy the Get Started Kit, despite the high price. And I am so glad I did. As soon as I stopped trying to cover my blemishes with pore-clogging liquid makeup, my skin got so much nicer looking! At first, it was a little awkward trying to cover the blemishes that I had left, but the frequency and severity of my breakouts has diminished incredibly in the past two months. Now, I just use Clinique Dramatically Different Moisturizing Gel (also incredibly amazing) and Clinique concealer underneath to take care of any problem spots, and I've found it works perfectly. My skin is softer, prettier, CLEARER. I feel so much more confident and beautiful. Though it's a bit pricy, it lasts a LONG time (the pots that came with the sample size have yet to run out, and they're a third of the size of the normal ones) and I think it's completely worth the money. The only problem is if you put too much on, it can get a little obvious that you're wearing powder makeup, so only use a little at a time. I guess I'd say the coverage is buildable, though the more you put on, the faker it looks… With the way it clears up your skin though, it's not a problem after a few weeks. I even wore this to a part and my makeup still looked pretty good in the morning, even after dancing all night long! I'll definitely be buying this again! Love love love it."

I tried a liquid base, and I feel like it didn't really cover or even out anything and it just made my skin more oily. Pressed powders never really did anything for me either, so I decided to go for this loose powder foundation in medium beige. I absolutely love it. It is so easy to apply and lasts so long (especially if you apply the prime time foundation primer before). I feel like my skin looks more even and it actually makes my pores disappear. I also like that there is some sunscreen in the makeup, so it helps prevent sun damage. I would recommend this to anyone with oily prone skin."

			"review_text": "Product: Bare Escentuals bareMinerals Foundation in Light (25.00 for 0.28 ounces) Shade: Sheer light golden cream  >> This product speaks for itself. It's made from pure, crushed minerals straight from our planet. It feels like a cream because it's so finely milled, applied like a powder - but never looks caky, and makes the skin like you've layered silk on it. It's the makeup that feels and looks like no makeup - but your face will be perfected. It's made without Parabens, Sulfates, Synthetic Fragrances/Dyes, Petro-Chemicals, Phthalates. Parabens are said to lead to cancer in woman, while synthetic items are not healthy for the skin. It won't irritate the skin or cause breakouts, which is a relief to all ladies~! According to the statistics on Sephora 98% of woman said their skin looked softer, smoother, and younger. 90% saw IMPROVEMENT in their SKIN with continuous use - a foundation that makes you not need to use foundation. 93% noticed that their skin looked more radiant!  >> So, what's my true opinion? I have 2 containers of this foundation, both mini sized. (10 Day Full Face Samples from Sephora.) They have lasted me for a year of light usage from day to day. (Not everyday of course, maybe 2-3 weeks of full face usage if you add it up.) What I'm trying to get at is this stuff lasts. The samples - that were free - lasted a good time for being a sample. I don't have the full size product, I want to get it, but I can bet you that it will last just as long. Obviously longer because it's bigger! Another nice thing is that it comes in so many different shades. I always feel annoyed when I look at a foundation and think, wow. There's 5 shades, and they're all for pale skinned girls. Really, leaving people out in makeup! Not cool! Being light skinned, I don't have a lot of problems, but some of my best friends have olive and darker skin. It's not fair that they can't use my favorite foundation, especially if we have the same skin type. This foundation comes in 20 shades, so any girl can find their perfect fit.  >> Besides that this foundation is certified organic it feels just plain good on the skin. I like to buff this on with a Kabuki Brush (small, dense, face brush.) for perfect application. The key to awesome looking skin is to begin by getting a chunk of product on the brush. Now swirl the brush in the cap to get a thin layer of powder on each bristle. Then, tap on the side of the cap so the excess falls in, and voila! You have a brush with the perfect amount of powder evened out. It has light to medium coverage, depending how much you layer it. It works good on girls who have redness, light blemishes, light acne scars, un-even skin tone, etc. If you have bad acne, and dark acne scars this might not be the best for you. But don't feel down! Apply your favorite foundation on first, and then apply this on top. It leaves anything powdery and fake with a soft natural glow. Of course, no sparkle.  >> The packaging on this is simple and sleek. The bottom is clear so you can see how much foundation you have, the and the top is matte black. To finish, this foundation has sunscreen, something every girl needs. Obviously you want to apply a sunscreen prior to foundation (apply a separate one for more protection of course!) but this adds a little more strength.  Effectiveness: 10/10 Value: 10/10 Packaging: 8/10 Ease Of Use: 10/10 Overall: 10/10  Grade: A+ Love this product all around - it's a great buy!"

Hired actresses peddling snake oil to the masses. I am 30 with sensitive, acne-prone skin, and like all other ladies in my position, I could finance a revolution with the amount of money I've spent trying to find products that will cover my existing bumps without causing new ones. I have been using bareMinerals foundation for about 7 years now, and not only does it still do a killer job of evening skin tone and covering occasional breakouts, but I need so much less makeup to get the look I want. Every so often I hear of some new wonder product or foundation and briefly stray to experiment, only to break out horribly and return to bareMinerals on my knees. As silly as I once thought it was, if someone asked me to be in one of those Bare Escentuals infomercials now, I would be the first one on camera to kiss Leslie's toes and thank her for this amazing foundation. So, if you have sensitive, acne-prone skin, I highly recommend trying this out and hope it works for you too!"

I used to use NARS pressed powder, but it started making me break out really really bad (I have oily, acne-prone skin). I decided to throw in the towel and switch to a makeup that wouldn't keep harming my skin. So, I started reading reviews of Bare Minerals, and they were so overwhelmingly good that I had to try it. Plus, the get-started kit is such a good deal, I couldn't pass it up. I didn't like it very much at first, but once I switched to the Matte formula and found my perfect color, I was blown away. It makes your skin SO smooth, and it doesn't look like I'm wearing makeup at all. The best part is that my skin has actually started clearing up now that I've been using it, and my overall skin tone seems better too. I will probably NEVER try another foundation again.

I just don't feel like it gives as good coverage for those of us with acne pigmentation/dark mark scarring. My review may be a little premature since I only tried it a few times since I've bought it and I'm still learning how to use it. Overall I'm happy with the natural look/feel, but not so much the coverage. I bought the starter kit for $48, and I like the brushes, but I think for those of you looking to buy it, you can do without all the things that come in the kit. Just go for the foundation, without all the frills its cheaper."

I don't even need a concealer anymore, I can get ready in 10 minutes. I am still trying to find the perfect shade, but right now medium is doing just the trick, as golden medium and medium beige were slightly too dark. I might even go to fairly medium. Also people have said that my skin looks flawless, and it looks much more natural than the MUFE concealer and LM powder combination I was wearing before. Try it out; and a little goes a long way if you use the tap, buff swirl process!"

While I was pregnant, my skin was horrible and I finally accepted that I was just going to have to wear tons of heavy foundation to cover my acne and the scars up. Not true! The Bare Escentuals foundation provides great coverage without feeling cakey/greasy/heavy by the end of the day. (Make sure you watch the instructional DVD that comes with the starter pack, and be patient with your application technique). Also, a lot of those heavy creamy foundations are not oil free so while they cover up the redness, they actually make the acne worse. Since I started using Bare Escentuals my skin has actually improved! My only complaint is that (because I use it to get a lot of coverage) a jar doesn't last that long, so it does get to be a little pricey. But now I'm hooked! I wish I had found Bare Escentuals years ago."

In the winter, I like to mix both together so I look as close to natural as possible.  I like the quality of this products; it doesn't completely cover my flaws (such as very bad blemishes) but it covers up the redness in my cheeks, evens out my tone and makes pimples, spots and other blemishes much less noticeable. I prefer powder foundation to cream or liquid because it takes a lot less time to apply and looks almost as good! It doesn't dry out my skin and it rarely falls into the creases or wrinkles I have - only if I've buffed too much of the product over my face.  I didn't give this product five stars because it can't cover up all blemishes as well as liquid foundation. However, I use this product almost every day and will continue to purchase it!"

I think if I had the correct shade I could build it better. Overall it isn't hurting my skin but it's not helping it in the way the product claims it does.  I think for $25 it should be a lot bigger. Also I hate the locking system. I've locked it and when I open it again it's open and their foundation under the locking area and I can't get it. (it's a large amount as well)"

I decided to try medium, which seems to be just right! I cannot say enough about the BE line of products - I have extremely sensitive skin, and my skin feels completely natural with the Bare Minerals, and people say they can't tell I have on any makeup at all. That's a great compliment to this line!!!"

I have combo skin with the occasional breakout. I was using Clinique liquid foundation when my mom bought a BE starter kit for my sister about five years ago. I was hesitant at first - I couldn't believe that this powder would offer coverage the way a liquid did. I was wrong - the coverage was better, and more natural-looking to boot! I have tried both the original and the matte and I go back and forth depending on the season. I love this makeup. It's so easy to blend; no more foundation line at my chin like I used to have with liquid. I don't feel like I am even wearing any makeup. I have also found that using the foundation dabbed on with the concealer brush works just as well - if not better - than the Bisque product for a concealer. I have tried several brushes and have found the one that works the best for application of the foundation is the Heavenly Face brush - TOTALLY worth the moolah, there.  I LOVE BE. I don't know what I would do if they quit making it! This stuff is magic."

I think I might purchase a shade darker than Fairly Light due to its actually lighter than it looks in the picture and I have to use Warmth brozer to make the right shade.

You can't see unless I get very close and show you, but I know they are there and I hate them. They form mostly on my chin. I saw a dermatologist who told me that since it it made of minerals, which are basically like ground up tiny rocks, that when you wash your face, you can't possibly wash it all off. The little pieces stick in your pores and your body produces oil to cover the foreign substance.  So, basically these bumps I was getting were due to the mineral powder. I stopped using it and saw immediate results. After months of not using the powder any longer, my skin is clear. So, it's a toss up!!"

I also have very oily skin, and needed a foundation that would work with my skin to avoid making it even more oily - this was perfect.  Additionally, it caused no breakouts, and very few people could tell I was wearing any makeup whatsoever (not to say that the coverage wasn't phenomenal -- it was just natural looking!)  The only catch is to wash the brushes every month or so, or else the bacteria will get trapped in the brushes, and might cause breakouts. Other than that simple microbiology fact (which applies to every single foundation known to womankind), I'm thrilled with this product."

BE for me is the finishing touch to my makeup regimen. I have acne scarring so to conceal I need to apply something other than BE as it doesn't give me full coverage. It gives you a natural look like you're born with beautiful skin. The first time I used BE foundation I didn't apply it correctly and sent it back. After some time I went back and gave it another shot and I'm so glad I did because it's something I cannot live without. I apply way more than the suggested amount. I see powder on my bristles, unlike how they present it on tv. Heavy handed or not, you still get a natural look. This was my initial experience with BE.

I guessed what my shade would be, and for the first time in my life, it was actually spot on. I have very fair, olive/yellow-toned skin and it's nearly impossible for me to find a foundation that matches me correctly...but because BareMinerals has such a great shade range, I was able to find my perfect shade. Awesome! I also LOVE how there's descriptions of the shades!  I have skin discoloration and I don't find this product to be much of a problem for that. Like any foundation, you need to layer on more for areas that need it.  Since this is a powder foundation, I'm not sure if I would recommend this for dry-skinned people. If you have dry patches, or dry skin in general, try exfoliating your skin and moisturizing it before applying this foundation so it doesn't emphasize your dry areas.  All in all, I love this foundation. It's great and I think I'll order my mom some!"

I use Warmth as an eyeshadow as well when I just want a simple, natural look during the day.  For anyone thinking about trying Bare Minerals - don't wait! Do it now. I had thought about giving it a try for a long time but just had a hard time switching from my favorite Chanel products. I'm saving tons of money using Bare Minerals since I finally made the switch a month ago."

For any Bare Essentuals users/future users, I have one piece of advice: to keep it from looking cakey and powdery, go into a Bare Essentuals store and ask for a demo on the best technique with which to apply the foundation. You need to put a little into the top and push down with your brush to actually break the powder down into a finer powder. Apply pressure also when applying it to your face and you'll get great coverage without the cakey look. The ladies at the stores are pros."

My face tends to get oily at times and this helped it alot and has buildable coverage. I use Fairly Light and then apply the warmth bronzer to create a perfect glow. Sonya Dakar Omega Oil for oily/combo skin works amazing with this and adds to the glow. I love this powder foundation and wont be switching to any other."

There are a few things I don't like about BM: 1) obviously it is a powder, which makes it kind of tricky to apply while driving (not that I do that......), 2) on summer days in 100+ weather, it can feel icky -- but I think that's just how makeup feels generally, and 3) the BM brushes scratch at my skin and the hairs in the brushes start to fall out after a few washes.  BUT... I love that this makeup isn't irritating, truly does make my skin look better (I've had compliments about my glowing skin, and people don't believe me when I insist I have awful skin---I DO!), and is natural.  I've tried moving on to other foundations, but I can't seem to stop coming back to BM. And, I LOVE that there are many more color choices than when they first started. I bought Golden Tan and thought it might be too dark, but actually blends perfectly with my Filipina skin. I recommend it to all my pals!  p.s. I tried the Matte version and actually prefer the regular version. It is not as drying, and seems to keep my skin in better condition--the matte version isn't much of a difference in oil control."

It's great when you begin using the makeup, but then after you use about half of it, you can't hardly get the rest out. You have to pop off the twisty part (which is a feat itself), and even then you can't really get to all of the makeup like you could with the old packaging.  I still give it 5 stars because the formula is so amazing, but I really wish the company would fix the packaging."

I researched the ingredients and came to realize that this product contains Bismuth Oxychloride, which gives you the glow in this makeup. This ingredient is known to irritate sensitive skin, so I have stopped using this product and switched to the bareMinerals Matte makeup as it does not contain Bismuth Oxychloride and I have had no problem with it.  Other than that minor set back, I feel like this product gives good coverage and feels lightweight; and with the primer it will stay in place all day! So if you don't have sensitive skin, I highly reccomend this product, but if you do, definitely try the Matte version. I love Bare Escentuals brand!"

I didn't think it could possibly so all the things it claimed to do in regards to improving skin condition, let alone provide good coverage. I was on the fence for a while, but I am beyond happy with this product. So glad I decided to try it!  Coverage: Light, and blends in with my skintone amazingly well. I use golden fair, and it's the closest match to my skin I've ever come across in a foundation. The coverage can be as sheer or as full as you need it to be. I have freckles on the bridge of my nose and across the tops of my cheeks that I love, and I can skip application in that area without it looking weird. It just makes my skin look the way it should: flawless and natural, without taking away my face's little quirks. Never fake.  Texture: Soooo soft! Leaves my face feeling silky. It's so fine that it really does feel like a cream. I have normal skin, and I haven't found it to be drying at all.  Application: Easy, great for a beginner. It's fairly messy, and you can see particles floating off into the air as you buff it on...which then stick to the package, your other makeup, everything. However, even with this annoying flaw, mine lasted a good 4 months with usage every day.  Other: As the description claims, I did see improvements in my skin's appearance as time went on. It doesn't clog my pores, and has never made me break out. Plus, it's natural! I don't feel like I'm slathering on chemicals for short term beauty that will harm my skin in the long run.  If you're on the fence like I was, I encourage you to try it. The hype isn't fake. You may just be surprised."

			"review_text": "BASICS: So I got the full BM/BE kit two winters ago & miraculously haven't run out of it yet. I love how the minerals aren't sparkly or shimmery like many other mineral foundations. I also like how it helps minimize shine in the T-Zone area.  I DONT LIKE: The only thing I don't like is how when my skin is dry in the fall/winter, it really emphasizes on the flakiness/rough patches of my skin. The commercial/box says sweat proof/fade proof/transfer proof but honestly, it's only transfer proof. I found that by the end of my school day, starting at 7:30 & ending at 2:30, my foundation had all worn off.  I DO LIKE: BUT, I do like how you can either have natural coverage or more flawless coverage. BM/BE is definitely buildable coverage either way. Also, you only need to use a little bit at a time so still, two years later, I haven't needed to buy a new set yet(:  ALL IN ALL: I will definitely continue to use BM/BE because all around it's a great mineral foundation. It allows your skin to breathe & helps with excess shine. For sure, I will buy BM/BE when I run out of my current set; luckily, that won't be for awhile due to it's small everyday usage(: So yes, I would definitely recommend this for a friend. I've tried other mineral foundations & none of them can ever compare to BM/BE(:"

In conclusion, the short term effects of this foundation is great..but in the long run, it made my skin break out, greasy, and dull (and thats with weekly deep cleansing as well)."

It provides natural, even coverage and covers most all my blemishes, discoloration, etc. Some adiitional concealer product is needed for any darker spots I want to lessen the appearance of.  What I don't like about this is that it comes off so easily; it's great that it doesn't take heavy cleansers to remove, but any light swipe of the face will remove a bit. The other negative is that after a period of time, it really settles into my pores and lines (even with the use of oil-blotting sheets and face primers)."

The first time I used this (over 5yrs ago) I found BE Minerals foundation to be very natural and had excellent coverage. My skin didn't react to it at all, and in just a few weeks, my skin looked great. BE Minerals foundation covered all of my dark spots, made my pores look smaller, and gave me an honest and natural coverage. It never feels heavy and it blends in beautifully. I've never gone back to liquid foundation and have used this one faithfully ever since. I highly recommend this foundation to anyone, young or older, who wants flexibility in thier foundation coverage. You can use as little or as much as you need to get the effect desired and still look natural. They come in many colors, so I'm sure there's one out there for just about anyone. Don't bother with the rest of the mineral foundations, BE is the first and still the best! I can say that now I use the entire line of makeup products and have never looked back.

The rosacea is not nearly as bad as it used to be, but I still have problems finding foundations that will cover the redness in my skintone. (If it's a little windy or a little cooler out, my skin breaks out in puffy blotches of red) This by far works better than any Walgreens or Walmart foundation I've bought. It doesn't irritate my skin at all, and it feels like I'm wearing nothing. The true test will be in the cold winds of winter!  I'm not sure if I totally love the luminous look of the original foundation though, so when I need to refill I'm going to try out the matte option.  I also love the new lock and go feature.

Since I purchased the starter kit I have never again put liquid foundation or concealer on. This product really is a miracle, It matches your skintone exactly no matter what shade you are & you can use the same shade year round - just use a touch more warmth in the summer. My skin also changes through the year, oily in summer & very dry in areas in the winter, Perfect all the time no matter what condition my skin is in. breakouts or flakiness; This still makes a gorgeous finish, layers well & you can use as little or much as you like depending on the flawlessness & coverage you're going for. So easy to apply & takes litterally seconds, Even when I don't wear makeup I buff a little on just because it makes your skin glow & look so perfect. The container lasts a couple of months for me & I use it every day, sometimes twice. All this & its very good for your skin too... Like I said - Miracle."

It blends really well and you can keep applying for more coverage. It also works well as a concealer with the concealing brush from BE.

It does have a luminescent finish that some may not care for, but it does not look cakey to me. Another thing I like about the product is that it is easy to match my skin tone, which has a lot of yellow in it. I blend the light and the golden medium to get my perfect shade. I also like that it has and SPF of 15. My only two minor complaints: 1. I have difficutly building enough coverage to disguise all the rosacea related redness that I have, 2. Any dry patches are more noticable with the powder. My favorite foundation is still DiorSkin Forever, but overall the bareMinerals is a good product. I would recommend it to those who do not have rosacea or dry skin."

I've slept in this stuff many times and I can't recall every breaking out from it. I use this along with the Mineral Veil over top and my makeup stays put until evening. I swear by this makeup and would recommend Bare Minerals to anyone who has sensitive skin or just wants the coverage of a foundation without actually wearing foundation. Love this stuff!"

It covered the broken capillaries on my cheeks nicely. Sadly, about a half an hour after application, my skin started to itch and when I finally got home to take the makeup off I had a bunch of pinpoint size whiteheads on my forehead and upper lip! I have NEVER broken out from a foundation before so I returned it. Happy it works for others but it just isn't for me."

I have tried various powder foundations, but I thought I'd try this since it is on the TV commercials like 24/7!  I could not help but to write a review since I think everyone (including women and men) should have the Bare Escentuals foundation. I do buy things off of TV a lot and find out that the product is not as good as it is shown on TV. BUT! This product is exactly what you see on TV! Whether it be for the purpose of going out, day-to-day wear or a photoshoot, this powder foundation makes my skin look radiant, clean, poreless, shineless- at the same time, NATURAL!  It is hard for me to find foundation that looks like I am wearing nothing, but this powder really sets and mixes with your natural tone and skin and makes your face look flawless. If you have dry skin like me, I suggest applying this right after your moisturize since it can look a bit chalky at the drier spots. The moisture of the moisturizer really combines will with the creamy texture of the powder, creating a perfect blend.  Numerous friends have commented on how my skin looks absolutely flawless (and no one suspects I wear foundation!)  The price is pretty fair considering you do not need to put a lot on for this magical foundation to work! I will DEFINITELY purchase again :)  Definitely ESCENTUAL to all!"

I can say that one positive factor is that it stayed put on hot, humid days in MI, unlike liquid foundation, so I do like that about it. It also didn't seem to blend into my skin very well, but rather sat on top of it even with using the BE Prime Time primer.

This new packaged original line is giving me the exact same result and I think even worsening my acne. The original line covered perfectly, used it as both concealor and powder and would last me through the whole day. Thinking it was the same, I've been using the new packaged original line for three months now (hoping I was wrong, I tried finishing the container) and my face has broken out worst than it's ever been and looks oily and dirty without any hint of coverage.

My searching stopped when I found this product. I love that this foundation offers buildable coverage; I typically I apply three light layers to my face (I apply with Full Coverage Kabuki Brush), but I add more layers if I ever feel that I need more coverage. Fortunately, that doesn't mean my look has to be cakey. This is the most natural foundation I've ever come across (and trust me, I've gone through a LOT of foundations...designers brands to drugstore brands, I've pretty much tried them all). Not only do I love this product's coverage, but I also love that it is healthy for my skin (I can actually sleep in it); it doesn't irritate my skin, cause dryness or breakouts. I also love that this product offers SPF.  When I first started using Bare Minerals Foundation, I used Medium Beige..and I continued to happily use it for about a year or so, but I found that it was actually making my face look lighter than it really was. After consulting with a Bare Minerals employee, she recommended that I change to Light. She told me that the problem wasn't that Medium Beige was too light for my skin; it was that there were too many pink tones in Medium Beige...thus, it worked against my skin to make it look lighter. Light compliments my olive undertones (I'm Filipino with medium skin tone).  The only con: the new dispenser. I hope they go back to the original dispenser."

I've been using Bare Escentuals for almost 6 years now and I liked everything about it, and I still do... except the new packaging. I hate it for a multitude of reasons but I'll just give you the main ones: 1) They put on a new dispenser that's supposed to be easier to use, but the holes are only on one side and it limits how much product you can dispense at a time. 2) The original dispenser (shown above) could be easily pried off so you could get another 4-5 days out of it before you needed to buy more. The new one is a fixed part of the container, and to get to that last bit, you have to get creative. (It took me a screwdriver and hammer to break the top to get it out.) 3) There is actually instructions that come with it that tell you step by step how to use the locking dispenser. Not only is it inane and wasteful, but isn't that why there's a lid in the first place? So if you've never bought it before, I still recommend it, but it had been better if they hadn't tried to reinvent the wheel, so to speak."

When it would get wet, my face would start stinging. And, my face was always red and irritated.  So, I asked her to help me find the perfect foundation. And, she chose Bare Escentuals.  She helped me sift through the ingredient list to make sure that the Bare Escentuals foundation had no ingredients in it that would cause me an allergic reaction.  She also, introduced me to skin care products that would work well with my skin type and meticulously sifted through ALL ingredients lists to make sure there were no allergens in them.  She probably spent an hour and a half with me helping me. To find customer service like that is almost unheard of.  I'm really happy she introducted me to Bare Escentuals because it helped me change myself from a gruesome embarrassment to being much more comfortable with my the way I look.  Thank you, Vikki! And, thank you Sephora for carrying excellent products like Bare Escentuals."

Light to medium at most without adding too much product to face. -Not recommended for blemished skin, it does nothing to conceal them -Can be drying for combo/dry skins  I currently am using it - but with concealer underneath to get more coverage and because liquid foundation is too heavy in the summer. However, when I need more coverage or if my face is breaking out, this makeup covers practically nothing.  I think this is a great natural foundation for someone with generally good (clear) skin who needs to cover minimally. I don't suggest this for people with lots of redness, bumps, or non-smooth faces. Also, not suggested for big events, since the coverage is minimal."

Then you have too much product to deal with - but not with this feature! Unfortunately, for some reason, the mineral veil does not have this twist cover feature - I wish it did!"

The matte looked darker on my skin than the orginal finish, making it a good option for the summer when my natural complexion gets slightly darker. Think about trying the bareMinearls Mineral Veil.

Personally, I wish Bare Escentuals made a cream concealer.  The variety of shades is excellent, the product has great coverage, and a kind of dewy finish.  The matte version has a better finish, but is way more expensive, due to both higher price and less volume per container.  If you've got the cash to spare, it's a great product.  But don't forget to apply moisturizer and/or primer first! It can make even the slightest dry skin look much drier without either of them."

It doesn't feel heavy on your face, and it gives you that smooth flawless finish. Besides all of that great stuff, it's 100% natural; all minerals! Good stuff, eh? The foundations come packaged in black with a little sifter; the matte foundations come with a sliding panel that makes sure nothing fall out. (The only downfall to this, I wish they added the sifter to this one!!) The price may seem high, but you get a huge tub of foundation, and you just need a little tapped into the lid to get all over your face.  So how exactly do you use this foundation? Well it's good to start off with a kabuki brush, which is a densely bristled squat brush. Simply tap some of the foundation into the lid and swirl the brush in it. When it is evenly covered with the product simply buff it into your face using circular slow motions. You can double this up as a concealer if you place it on a pointed concealer brush and dab it on red areas or on blemishes. (Not the best dark circle cover-up obviously.)  Overall this is an amazing foundation, the soft minerals won't leave your face looking dry and hard. Plus it gives a beautiful natural finish without a glittery look; and you can add as much as you need for that flawless face! Oh, and with so many shades to choose from, you'll never feel left out!"

Sephora matched me as a medium, and that was waay too dark! I went back and asked them to match me again, and I got Fair. That STILL wasn't right, so I tried Light. Finally, I gave up on Sephora and went to a Bare Escentuals Boutique, where the girls picked out Bisque (which I use first) and the foundation in Fairly Medium, which matches my skin and neck PERFECTLY! Don't get me wrong-I love Sephora, so no offense to them, but the girl I talked to didn't seem to know what she was doing! I will buy the makeup at Sephora as I need it, but initially, I had to go the the Bare Escentuals Boutique so I could figure out my proper shade. Anywaysss, this is the best foundation ever.

YOU CAN USE IT AS EYESHADOW for a marvelously natural look buy some a few shades off from your skin tone and you have amazing eyeshadow it enhances beauty without anyone knowing it there. it doesn't slip slide or crease. its very water resistant. i read an article on beauty. and what we consider pretty as a society... has to do with different values. like in a black and white photo some areas are darker in value than other. the article said that this may be a reason that in many different cultures women wear eyeshadow and eyeliner. they add darker values which is what we consider pretty. this adds value but makes it look natural for eyeshadow that is.

I have pink undertones in my skin (which I hate), and I was looking for a yellow based color but the sales clerk told me that it would clash with my skin and make it seem orangey, maybe she's right, because this color works so what can I say. I already had the featherlight mineral veil, so I just use it over that and it gives a nice luminous glow which is what I like. Overall happy with this product and is a good replacement for powder. Looks like you have no make up on and that's what I like, not that heavy made up look you get from other foundations,,,,,blah"

Coverage: It does give you a natural looking cover and it does even out your skin tone, for the most part. It looks great face to face but it looks washed out, dull, creased to heck, and lifeless on film. So wear this for a shopping trip to the grocery store but not to the social gathering where people are going to be taking pictures, otherwise you'll look like Dracula's wife with deep, crusty facial lines in the pictures.  Application: I like the brush application although the brushes do lose their bristles causing make-up boo boos. Overall the brush is the best and least wasteful way to put on any makeup.  Packaging: This has always been my least, least favorite thing about Bare Min. The containers are sturdy plastic but the probability for spillage due to the wide open spaces is high. It's worse than that too. Once this stuff spills, it'll stain your counter top till you take scrub to it. And good luck getting it off your clothes ... other than desperate flicks. I wish there was another way of containing and using this stuff instead of with a large opening and small mixing area.  Scent: There is none."

If you want a FULL coverage and have dark spot scars, this won't cover it up fully. I didn't mind having my acne scars show a little because seriously people, ONLY you care and notice the small spots on your face. No one will look at your face and tell you that your foundation isn't covering everything or even notice your little flaws on your face. When I had really dark scars from my acne however, I used little bit on foundation on the spot and used the mineral foundation on top of it. I will never go back to liquid foundation, because I have acne-prone oily skin. Also if it looks un natural after you put it on, just wait a little, your natural skin oil will melt it into your skin and you will be fabulous"
