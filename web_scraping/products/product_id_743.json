I haven't used it for too long which I was going to do before I made my review, but I love it so much that I'd just like to share it. I'm generally sensitive to scents and this smells AMAZING. You definitely only need a pea-sized amount or less, which I'm still working on üôà also saw a few people say it made their face feel squeaky which I did not experience, but the texture of the cleanser is truly unlike anything else I've experienced.  But overall, so far at least, totally love this product!"

Love the way it foams up, love how clean my skin feels after, and using it in conjunction w my toner, the InnisFree hyaluronic serum, and their green tea cream - my skin is SO happy and hydrated."

My face felt like my moisture barrier was off after I used it and anything else I used stung.  My face looked red and irritated.  I tried it twice and gave up and immediately reordered the cherry blossom one which is much more gentle.  I don‚Äôt know who this would work for because stripping is not good for anyone.

			"review_text": "Unsponsored / bought with my own money full price! DO NOT BUY. Even with my extremely oily, sensitive skin, it left a squeaky clean feel while not feeling cleansed at all. It was extremely drying, and constantly felt like I hadn't washed it all away. I never usually leave reviews, even if they're bad, but I felt deceived since I bought this based on the thousands of 4+ star reviews on Google (clearly sponsored/incentivized to inflate the overall review score) Only + side, which is also a - aspect too - it foams a little too much (it feels like you didn't wash all of it off) & smell (fragrance is very very strong - be prepared to break out in redness & react if you have any sensitivity). It burns badly if you get it too close to your eyes. It is the most drying cleanser I've used - on par to Clean & Clear, or Neutrogena that haunts my preteen years. Even with the new formula/packaging, they still say hydrating, which is so deceptive. Yes Green Tea is a hydrating ingridient, but the way its formulated as a foam is so stripping. Right after washing my face, it's like the waterdrops are begging to be absorbed into my skin bc it's so dry but it's like repelled off. Truly a squeaky, almost plastic/rubbery feel while also feeling there's still gunk on my face. Since I bought full size, I'm just using it on my chest & back since it foams so much, but it leaves those areas feeling dry too. WOULD NOT RECOMMEND even for very oily, acne-prone people like me."

My skin feels soft, clean and refreshed after use.  A little goes a long way! You only need a small amount to produce a good lather.

I have dry skin and usually people with dry skin tend to stay away from foaming cleansers but this one did not dry me out at all! This cleanser claims to be hydrating and it absolutely is! I have been using the Green Tea Amino Hydrating Cleansing Foam every day and night for almost a month and I noticed within the first week that my skin had become visibly brighter and softer and I really believe this is a result of its hydrating properties. Over a longer period of time, my skin has also become softer to the touch! This is not a claim the product makes but it happened for me.  The product tells us that we only need a pea size and it is NOT lying. I squeezed out about a quarter size of product on my first use, thinking they were just exaggerating and a quarter size was TOO MUCH. A pea size is literally all you need!!! It lathers and foams like nobody‚Äôs business!!!! Even with all this lather, it didn‚Äôt strip my skin at all. It is also super soft and almost silky to the touch! The smell is very pleasant, I know some people don‚Äôt like fragrance in their skincare, but I wouldn‚Äôt consider this fragrance, honestly. It literally just smells like soapy green tea, which is basically what is in the product! The scent disappears immediately once you wash your face, so even if you don‚Äôt like the scent, you don‚Äôt have to endure it !  If the product was trash I would definitely be real and say it but I truly do believe that the claims this cleansing foam makes are genuinely true! I am not only saying that because I received this product for free in exchange for a review. I have already gone out and bought a backup!!!!!! This is my new favorite cleanser and I am so glad I got the opportunity to try it for free because I would have never tried it otherwise.

I have to give the product credit where it is due, however. I have found that a little can go a long way, meaning I don't have to squeeze out as much cleanser to cover my entire face as some other cleansers. It also has a nice, creamy texture. The last I want to mention is its smell, which is good but has a weird aspect. When you first put it on your face, it smells like chemicals, but a second later, it smells refreshing. I'm not sure what about the formula would cause this, and I find the transforming scent a bit strange.

Don't settle for harsh cleansers that dry out your skin - give the Innisfree Green Tea Hyaluronic Acid Face Cleanser a try and experience the difference for yourself!"

I feel the Hyaluronic acid is such an important inclusion , especially in Canada with our dry cold winters. After cleansing my skin does not feel tight or dry.

It is called a cleansing foam but came out of the tube like a cream. It has a nice light natural green tea smell, it is semi firm to touch but melts away into a soft buttery cream which then turns into a foamy cleanser when you add water. It lathers really well and rinses away all impurities. Normally not a fan of cream cleansers but this is the exception!  I was surprised how a little goes a long way. I used about a half inch of this cream cleanser for my entire face and neck and that was too much. No need to use that much. Only a little needed. I used it like a cream moisturizer and spread it all over. I then used a wet reusable cotton cleaning pad to wash my face and it immediately lathered into a foamy cleanser. I then rinsed by splashing my face with lukewarm water.  I used again in the morning and again at night. This time I made sure I had mascara on to see how well it removed it without making my eyes hurt. It removed everything with ease. As with any cleanser, if you get a little in the eye, it will sting a bit but it doesn‚Äôt make my eyes red or irritated.  Ingredients are natural and contain naturally derived Green Tea root and amino acids.   My skin type is normal to combination. Occasionally dry in the winter months. I rarely ever break out but if I do, it is in the T zone!  This is a cleanser that removes makeup, sunscreen and oils without clogging pores.  Love how my skin feels after using it.   Overall, this Cleansing Foam made my skin feel super clean, smooth and hydrated. It doesn‚Äôt leave my skin tight and provides a gentle non stripping cleanse that leaves you feeling fresh! I am so impressed and I highly recommend. I will definitely buy this when I run out!"

I recently incorporated the Innisfree Green Tea Hyaluronic Acid Face Cleanser into my daily skincare routine, and I'm delighted with the results. This cleanser offers a refreshing and hydrating experience that has truly elevated my cleansing routine.  The star ingredient, green tea, is known for its antioxidant properties, and I could feel the soothing effects on my skin from the very first use. The cleanser has a gentle, gel-like consistency that lathers up nicely without stripping the skin of its natural moisture. What sets it apart is the inclusion of hyaluronic acid, which adds a layer of hydration, leaving my skin feeling plump and nourished after each use.  One of the standout features is the subtle and invigorating fragrance of green tea, which adds a spa-like element to my daily skincare ritual. The scent is not overpowering, making it a pleasant experience for those who are sensitive to fragrances.  I appreciate that this cleanser effectively removes impurities and makeup without causing any dryness or tightness. It's suitable for all skin types, but especially beneficial for those with normal to dry skin who are looking for a hydrating cleanser. I noticed that my skin feels clean and refreshed, yet still maintains a healthy balance.  The packaging is also worth mentioning ‚Äì the flip-cap design is convenient and ensures that the product dispenses easily without any mess. The sleek, green bottle adds a touch of freshness to my skincare shelf.  In conclusion, the Innisfree Green Tea Hyaluronic Acid Face Cleanser has become a staple in my skincare routine. It strikes the perfect balance between effective cleansing and gentle hydration, making it an excellent choice for anyone seeking a reliable daily cleanser with added skincare benefits. I highly recommend giving it a try for a refreshing and revitalizing cleansing experience."

I sometimes use Differen gel, but will also use Farmacy Honey Halo where I am really dry. I also love the Innisfree Green Tea Serum for a light, everyday moisture.   It takes off makeup, and foams up nicely with only a pea-sized amount. This is a great value, and this brand doesn't get the attention it deserves."
