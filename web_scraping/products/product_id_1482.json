The vanilla in this isnu2019t overpowering or that super sugary scent that seems to be popular with folks right now. I think it has a lot to do with the subtle coffee scent it has in between. Itu2019s warm and inviting maybe a bit enticing, perfect for dates or a cozy night in.  Travel size lasts a long time and is incredibly handy when you need a quick touch up.   Lasts a decently long time but would probably need to reapply mid day or night depending on how poignant you want the scent to be on your skin."

I was afraid it would be too oriental for my liking, but the caramel and cappuccino notes are stronger than any oriental vibes. It's an intense, heavy, medium lasting scent; usually on me very sweet gourmand fragrances don't smell as heavy so I would wear this on any occasion, but most people most likely will prefer this as an evening or winter fragrance. I was expecting some lightness from the name (Vanilla Sky), but I'm not disappointed in what I found."

Not sure why, but for the price you would think it would have a longer lasting scent like the one from the Skylar official website, I will purchase again through official website due to the lack of longevity with the one purchased from Sephora. Otherwise it smells exactly the same!   Smell is a soft vanilla, but wrapped in cashmere thatu2019s the best way to describe it, this is an amazing Fall scent."

It is also a good scent to mix with another.  Top: Cappuccino, Sweet Orange, Bergamot  Middle: Vanilla, Spanish Jasmine, Cinnamon  Base: Caramel, Amber, Sandalwood, Cedar  It's one of those scents that you keep coming back to on your wrist all day long.  Hints of caramel and coffee in the dry down.  Very safe. Simple...not luxurious.  But very gorgeous."

Maybe 30-40 minutes if I douse my clothes in it (slight hyperbole -- 5 to 6 sprays also). And even in those minutes, the scent is SOOOO light that you have to put your nose right against your skin/clothes to smell a HINT of something sweet. I smell very, VERY slight vanilla, other vaguely sweet stuff, but NO coffee/cappuccino. Oh, and in the first 2 minutes, straight up alcohol.   If I used this everyday for a month, I'm 100% sure I can use up the whole full-sized bottle.  If you want a vanilla perfume that actually lasts (3-4 hours on me), projects something other than H2O, and actually smells like vanilla go with Vanilla 28."

Has a soft and sweet woody cedar scent that develops more during the dry down and just a hint of coffee. Such a pretty fragrance! The longevity and projection are good, I can smell it most of the day, but might apply a little more if I were going out later. I think this one is a safe blind buy for vanilla lovers!"

In comparison to Fresh Cream Vanilla Cashmere by Philosophy (my favorite vanilla), this is it - but with added toasty notes from the cappuccino and cedarwood!!!! Fabulous for fall - this will be my new everyday instead of Fresh Cashmere Warm Cashmere to get that final test, but I see myself making this my new vanilla!  Scent - 10/10 Longevity - 7/10 as of now, expected though with a vanilla Season - I'll be using it year round - but loading it on for the fall winter~!"

This also didn't just happen once- the first time I concluded something else caused it and didn't think too much of it, then later a more prominent spot right under the bottle showed up confirming it was in fact the perfume. I cannot say anything actually bad about the perfume itself since I've been using it for around a year and do like the smell, but this should not have happened and I am very upset about it"

The former provides warmth, but Itu2019s the latter that makes this smell clean.   Overall, this perfume reminds me of what a warm, clean cashmere scarf would smell like. Itu2019s sexy and feminine, and unlike anything Iu2019ve ever smelled before.   Longevity is quite decent - it starts off quite strong and slowly fades into a beautiful skin scent. Since itu2019s on the heavier side, this scent would definitely be better suited for the colder months. But this would make a stellar signature scent."

It is the perfect in-between that gives me a beautiful vanilla scent throughout the day. Totally in love!"

I have chronic migraines; scents that are intoxicating at first can in a few hours become unbearable. I don't have that problem with Vanilla Sky. Its notes are delicious, yet mild and not 'controversial'; for example, Vanilla Woods by 7 Virtues has a smoky note that can become extremely annoying on a bad day. Vanilla Sky doesn't have anything like that. It's true that it doesn't last long, maybe a couple of hours; for people who are sensitive to scent that can be a big advantage as that means the scent will fade more quickly if it happens to trigger them that day. Only downside is I'm sure I'll go through these quickly due to reapplying and spraying on clothes. This is a scent to wear if you want everyone - and I mean everyone, this scent is not a controversial one - to think you smell good, and you don't want to trigger your (or anyone else's) headaches."

I was worried based on reviews with longitivity but for me I rolled it on in the evening and still smelled it on me the next morning! so no problems there just make sure to moisturize your skin before it will keep the scent lingering!

There is a muted cloudy image on the underside of the label, which is visible if the label faces away from you.

I agree with the other reviewer who said itu2019s more complex than your usual vanilla fragrance.  Of course you notice the vanilla at first, but then the cedarwood base kicks in, and itu2019s very warm and comforting like a luxurious and cozy candle on a chilly autumn evening.  As far as longevity goes, the scent did fade after an 8 hour day out and about, but the good thing about rollerballs is how portable they are for when you need a quick touch-up.  The big differentiator with this brand though is that the fragrances are cruelty-free and safe for sensitive skin.  (Youu2019d be surprised at how many luxury brand fragrances are not cruelty-free!)  On top of that, Skylar is female and BIPOC-founded, so even more reason to celebrate!  I will definitely be coming back for more from Skylar!"
