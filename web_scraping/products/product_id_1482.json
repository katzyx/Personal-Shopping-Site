			"review_text": "Absolutely love this! Especially if I mix it with my YSL Libre intense. I get compliments all night! The vanilla in this isn’t overpowering or that super sugary scent that seems to be popular with folks right now. I think it has a lot to do with the subtle coffee scent it has in between. It’s warm and inviting maybe a bit enticing, perfect for dates or a cozy night in.  Travel size lasts a long time and is incredibly handy when you need a quick touch up.   Lasts a decently long time but would probably need to reapply mid day or night depending on how poignant you want the scent to be on your skin."

			"review_text": "As a warm vanilla gourmand lover, SKYLAR Vanilla Sky is a great pick! I was afraid it would be too oriental for my liking, but the caramel and cappuccino notes are stronger than any oriental vibes. It's an intense, heavy, medium lasting scent; usually on me very sweet gourmand fragrances don't smell as heavy so I would wear this on any occasion, but most people most likely will prefer this as an evening or winter fragrance. I was expecting some lightness from the name (Vanilla Sky), but I'm not disappointed in what I found."

My sister has the same one purchased from the official Skylar site and it lasts all day into the next day. I bought mine from Sephora and it doesn’t last as long. Not sure why, but for the price you would think it would have a longer lasting scent like the one from the Skylar official website, I will purchase again through official website due to the lack of longevity with the one purchased from Sephora. Otherwise it smells exactly the same!   Smell is a soft vanilla, but wrapped in cashmere that’s the best way to describe it, this is an amazing Fall scent."

I prefer the rollerball to the large spray. I find the scent lasts longer using the rollerball for some reason?!? 10mL seems like a very small amount, but this lasts about 3-4 months for me. I'm on my 2nd one and I'll be buying it again!"

Hints of caramel and coffee in the dry down.  Very safe. Simple...not luxurious.  But very gorgeous."

Maybe 30-40 minutes if I douse my clothes in it (slight hyperbole -- 5 to 6 sprays also). And even in those minutes, the scent is SOOOO light that you have to put your nose right against your skin/clothes to smell a HINT of something sweet. I smell very, VERY slight vanilla, other vaguely sweet stuff, but NO coffee/cappuccino. Oh, and in the first 2 minutes, straight up alcohol.   If I used this everyday for a month, I'm 100% sure I can use up the whole full-sized bottle.  If you want a vanilla perfume that actually lasts (3-4 hours on me), projects something other than H2O, and actually smells like vanilla go with Vanilla 28."

I honestly cannot tell you exactly how it happened... it may have been something about the actual glass bottle, or my other theory is that the perfume leaked out of the bottom (which shouldn't be happening regardless) and then caused a melted rectangle imprint on the top of my dresser along with a number of stains from the oil. This also didn't just happen once- the first time I concluded something else caused it and didn't think too much of it, then later a more prominent spot right under the bottle showed up confirming it was in fact the perfume. I cannot say anything actually bad about the perfume itself since I've been using it for around a year and do like the smell, but this should not have happened and I am very upset about it"

It’s a blend of several gourmand notes (largely a “milky” note, which is probably what is supposed to be the cappuccino. along with cinnamon and a touch of vanilla), plus citrus and jasmine to round it out. The former provides warmth, but It’s the latter that makes this smell clean.   Overall, this perfume reminds me of what a warm, clean cashmere scarf would smell like. It’s sexy and feminine, and unlike anything I’ve ever smelled before.   Longevity is quite decent - it starts off quite strong and slowly fades into a beautiful skin scent. Since it’s on the heavier side, this scent would definitely be better suited for the colder months. But this would make a stellar signature scent."

I wish I could find the right words to describe how pleasant smelling it is, or how it made me feel just smelling it, this is the best I can do…I sprayed some on the sample card and took a sniff…it was the most pleasant sensory overload, I have never experienced a smell like this, it was so complex and unique…it’s like fresh air, and ice cream, but there’s a “grown up” sort of vibe that settles in after that initial creamy vanilla smell, probably the subtle hint of cappuccino….but when the cedar hits—oh man….if you know what freshly carved or sanded cedar wood smells like then you get me….it is one of my favourite smells on the planet (my father was a carpenter/furniture maker). This combination of notes was invigorating and fresh yet warm and comforting, sweet but earthy, gourmand and somehow still mature. If you love vanilla, I can’t see you disliking this…it’s like the ultimate vanilla scent… But if you are intrigued by the smell of cedar, this is worth sampling or even blind buying in my opinion. I also LOVE that this is clean, and hypoallergenic. The stay power is remarkable too, I used 3 sprays and can still smell it after almost 12 hours! Price is totally reasonable."

In my experience this is a great all-around vanilla for people who are sensitive to perfume. I have chronic migraines; scents that are intoxicating at first can in a few hours become unbearable. I don't have that problem with Vanilla Sky. Its notes are delicious, yet mild and not 'controversial'; for example, Vanilla Woods by 7 Virtues has a smoky note that can become extremely annoying on a bad day. Vanilla Sky doesn't have anything like that. It's true that it doesn't last long, maybe a couple of hours; for people who are sensitive to scent that can be a big advantage as that means the scent will fade more quickly if it happens to trigger them that day. Only downside is I'm sure I'll go through these quickly due to reapplying and spraying on clothes. This is a scent to wear if you want everyone - and I mean everyone, this scent is not a controversial one - to think you smell good, and you don't want to trigger your (or anyone else's) headaches."

Once she said that, I couldn’t stop smelling the smokiness and it kind of ruined the scent for me. Not sure how crazy that sounds but I would recommend this for anyone looking for a good vanilla scented fragrance"

I really like this because it has a natural vanilla scent, along with a hint of a coffee scent, and a little bit of caramel when it dries on my skin. The only thing that is a bummer is it doesn’t last long on my skin at all. Within an hour I don’t even smell it.

I don’t totally mind this as i love to have my favorite scents reserved for like… an up close situation with people (iykyk), but i’d like to know i actually applied just an hour later.

I agree with the other reviewer who said it’s more complex than your usual vanilla fragrance.  Of course you notice the vanilla at first, but then the cedarwood base kicks in, and it’s very warm and comforting like a luxurious and cozy candle on a chilly autumn evening.  As far as longevity goes, the scent did fade after an 8 hour day out and about, but the good thing about rollerballs is how portable they are for when you need a quick touch-up.  The big differentiator with this brand though is that the fragrances are cruelty-free and safe for sensitive skin.  (You’d be surprised at how many luxury brand fragrances are not cruelty-free!)  On top of that, Skylar is female and BIPOC-founded, so even more reason to celebrate!  I will definitely be coming back for more from Skylar!"
