Me? I use this nightly on top of my retinol and wake up with lovely, plump, moisturized skin. A must have for dry (maybe more mature) skin. Granted, it may not be for everyone but I won’t use anything else."

They are just trying to trick you into wasting product on your hands. This company is owned by the Estee Lauder who has a history of false advertising and promotions. You can find a better creme at the drugstore where they will also treat you better than La Mer."

			"review_text": "I have been reading about La mer for more than a decade and I kept dreaming of when I will be able to afford it. Then the time came. I was only able to afford the mini though but I felt so excited nevertheless,  it was like a dream come true. I started with lamer soft cream, ( i had read some reviews about the original creme de la mer being too thick) and  yes within 1 week, I felt and saw the difference in my skin plump and glow, this healthy looking relaxed skin.I was bought! And ready to stick to the brand for life. But because it was the mini size, it didn't last me for more than 3 weeks. I decided to repurchase but this time, the original creme de la mer thinking because it is thicker, it will last longer. I was right on it lasting longer. But as per the effect on my skin-Horrible!!! To say the least. No matter how much I warm it up with my fingers as described and shown in the video,  this stuff won't get absorbed into my face skin. It just sits on my skin, with an ugly and sickly looking white cast like I am using a sunscreen or a foundation of lighter shade. Having read thousands of good reviews about this product,  I thought things will change with time plus considering the hard earned money i used to buy it.After about a week, my face started breaking out in an unusual manner. The break outs seem to be beneath my skin like with a veil...funny right. My skin became the dullest I have ever seen it. No radiance, no glow, just total dullness  that makes me sad when I look at my face in the mirror. I won't ever be buying creme de lamer again. Never. Maybe the soft cream in the future. Thank God I started with that. But I need to get over the waste of hard earned  money, the disappointment as well as the terribly DULL face. I have learned a lesson though. Reviews are not a reliable guide to choosing to buy a skin care product!  Thank you."

I’ve tried all sorts of things to control them, but really the only solution I’ve found is proper sleep, a good diet, a good gentle exfoliation, and staying on top of moisturizing.    I originally tried La Mer when I got a sample off the rewards bazaar.   It is crazy moisturizing, doesn’t sting my dry patches ever, and basically helps them to heal up.  I went years only getting the samples or buying the small jar and using it when my skin was at its worst.  Finally I’ve given up and use this as my everyday moisturizer.  I can buy a few less foundations or eye shadow palettes but good skin is a must.    I wish La Mer didn’t have fragrance and I really wish it wasn’t so crazy expensive.  I deducted a star for the price, because it’s totally insane.   I just haven’t found a cheaper alternative (yet) that works as well for my particular skin issues.   So there you are.  It’s a great product.   I love what it does for my skin.  But I hate the price."

			"review_text": "First thing, it’s going to make your skin glow from the first use. It also adds notable clarity. It somewhat helps with acne and marks. You have to make sure you’re rubbing it between your hands and then patting it on to the face. You only need the smallest amount, just to cover your face- I use less than they advertise and less than I would use for my other creams. Any more is really too much, and you run the risk of greasiness, whiteheads, clogged pores and breakouts. I’ve been having major inflammation in my skin and after months of using it, it barely improved on these factors. I would really recommend using Drunk Elephant Wonderwild Miracle Butter- that stuff heals. This gives a luminous glow, a pricey one. It’s hard to rate this product without factoring in the exorbitant price. You really can find better or equivalent moisturizers for cheaper. So much of your skin is also due to lifestyle. I had to take off one star for the price which is hard to purely justify, and it also tends to enlarge your whiteheads. I took off another star because the ingredient list is also concerning- mineral oil, petrolatum and that it may give you breakouts. It does indeed smell like your grandmother’s cream. That being said, if nothing else works for you and this does, then it’s a small price to pay. Moreover if you really want a glow and can’t seem to get one, then this may be your product. I would really advise getting a sample or a trial size to try it out to make sure that your skin likes it before committing."

Yes it’s thick but if used properly, it’s not that thick on the skin. It’s extremely hydrating and only a small amount is needed to benefit from this product. I had a sample set of La Mer products and the week of use is what turned me on to them. I noticed the difference in my skin almost immediately. I’ve been using this for over a year and I get compliments on my skin frequently. I also get Botox, but I only get it 3x a year, my doctor recently commented on how great my skin looked and asked what I was using because he could tell a difference in my skin. While this is a very expensive product, it’s worth the investment, especially for those who already invest in their skin with Botox. And a little goes a long way. I can make a tiny jar last for months. Worth every penny in my opinion and I have used a lot of products over the years, inexpensive and expensive."

I then used A on the left side of my face and B on the right each night for a week. Shockingly, they really are basically identical. They’re both decent occlusive night creams, but neither really did anything for me besides locking in whatever moisture my skin already had. I still had all the same issues with my skin that I normally do, except the La Mer side actually had some extra breakouts and redness that the Nivea side didn’t have.

I wanted to know what the hype about the ridiculously expensive skin care line was about.   What a disappointment. Let’s focus on just the moisturizer for this review - my eyes are watering from the strong scent it exudes and there is a slight tingly/burning sensation throughout my face (something I have never experienced with any other product before). The scent isn’t foul, but the thing about me is that I would much rather wear perfume on my décolletage than my face. The moisturizer applies very thin and feels almost powdery once dried down, yet remains hydrating. I mention this because I can at least confirm that the product is high quality - a little will go a long way and it won’t stay greasy or goopy on your face. However, everything else falls short.  Is it a nice moisturizer? Yes, I think overall it is. The burning, I presume, is from the heavy fragrance,  but isn’t unbearable, and the cream feels nice otherwise. Is it worth the pretentious price tag? Absolutely not, especially as other reviewers mentioned, the consideration that this cream has very basic ingredients. I think you could find an equally wonderful moisturizer for a fraction of the price, at a larger fluid size at that.  If you love this cream or want to splurge - please do so and live your best life! We should all enjoy in a little luxury now and again, whether it’s La Mer or Starbucks!"

It has a light-weight, luxury, and moisturising feeling that no other cream could give me. I also found it to soak into my skin really easily and it looks SO good under my makeup! When I have a full face on, I usually wear the Armani Foundation, Nars Concealer, Hourglass Powder, Westman Atelier Contour Stick, Charlotte Tilbury Bronzer Powder, Charlotte Tilbury Highlighter, Nars Powder Blush, Tom Ford Eyeshadow, Lancome Volumizing Mascara, Tom Ford Brow Sculptor, and Charlotte Tilbury Airbrush Flawless Setting Spray. IT ALWAYS LOOKS PERFECT. GET IT IF YOU FEEL LIKE SPENDING MONEY ON A LUXURY SKINCARE ITEM BECAUSE THIS ONE IS SO GOOD!! You will definitely see changes in your skin, good ones. (Overall, great cream for all skin types, cute packaging, little goes a long way, and light-weight/luxury feeling on skin.)"

The salesgirl helping me today told me I was USING IT WRONG and I was like, I don't know how to apply face cream?? Apparently you're never supposed to spread la mer products on your face! I got another sample and immediately tried it using the proper method of warming between fingers and then patting on face. Wowwwww so much nicer experience and yes, I came to write this review just to share what I learned today. Sticker shock remains unchanged but I read all the reviews online and sure enough, many of the 1-2 stars reviews are complaining about the spreadability and even under instructions it says PRESS INTO FACE, DO NOT MASSAGE. I feel like it should be more prominently labeled but I guess it wouldn't make for very aesthetic packaging. If you're reading this, I hope this helps!!"

My 5 ML sample lasted me a little more than a month - a little goes a long way! My skin feels smooth and slowly, I and other people have noticed my dark spots fade away. Just the past two weeks, two different have commented on how good my skin looked and couldn’t believe that I wasn’t wearing any makeup. However, it is overpriced in my opinion and consistency is key. So if you don’t have the budget for this, you won’t really see lasting results. I just bought the $100 mini jar after my sample ran out which should last me 3 months at least.

Initially I didn’t love it because I thought it was thick and pasty. A couple of tips turned this cream into a silky, luxurious product for me, however.  One, it helps to warm up the cream in your hands first—this allows for greater spreadability. Second, applying on slightly damp skin (in addition to the above step) helps the cream melt into the skin even better. I personally like to use this as an overnight mask and the last step in my evening routine as it’s very occlusive.   Do I see a reduction in fine lines or any other such drastic changes with the Crème de la Mer?  No, I do not, but it’s a fantastic moisturizer and when my skin is hydrated it looks more youthful. It’s not a must buy but it’s a lovely treat for me when my budget allows it."

Even though I will feel the pain of repurchasing it, I'm going to do it because my skin has never looked more glowy and healthy than when I use this creme. If you do choose to purchase this creme, PLEASE read the directions! This is a really thick creme that needs to be activated in your fingertips before applying. Once you activate the creme, it literally melts into your skin, giving you a fantastic glow.

There’s nothing super wrong with it, but there’s also nothing that feels all that special. For the price, you’d expect to wake up with brand new looking skin and it just doesn’t do that for me. I have felt a significant difference even overnight from much more affordable moisturizers like the Tatcha dewy skin cream. Also, this smells exactly like Nivea cream, which is just ??? I would never spend any amount of money on this. Use a good retinol and a night cream with ceramides and peptides—it’ll do far more for your skin for FAR less money."

I received the most lovely compliment a week after using.  I am nearing 44, and I was told someone really liked how I did my makeup. Thing is, I was not wearing makeup. I simply moisturized.

I actually tried this creme a few years back (in my 20s), my skin hated it then and it disapproved it by protesting with a bunch of milia and tiny pimples. The moment I hit my big 3, my skin decided to act wild (extra sensitive in forms of flame ups and pimples) and I tried various products, but this was the only thing that calmed it down. Yes, after a few years my skin decided it likes miracle broth, wasted my money back then. What a grumpy and demanding child! I started with a mini emulsion and creme (gifts from La Mer), then I ran to grab the full size emulsion and creme... And because my skin loved it so much, I bought the creme duet set and another full size emulsion just to make sure I have backups.  The creme feels similar to Nivea cream, but it's not the same... I tried to get my skin to like Nivea but it simply didn't like it and didn't calm anything down, it's a great moisturizer for the body though. The smell of Creme de La Mer is more elegant than the smell of Nivea Cream. Someone said rotten seaweed, perhaps they got a bad batch? I love the smell, a very calming sensorial flight for me every time I use it (AM and PM, and sometimes mid day if I go out and decide to wash my face mid day). I use two pumps of emulsion then follow up with a pearl size of creme warmed up between my finger tips and patted on. My skin calmed, smoothed, lifting, and firmed; and my skin haven't glow like this since my teens. Will keep repurchasing until my skin decides it likes another product! The price isn't bad, you only need a pearl size each time, a 7mL lasts me 2wks and 15mL 4wks with me using it almost 3 times every day. I bought the creme duet which is a 60mL + 15mL and that should last me a while. If you buy a 60mL (4mths about) at CAD$470, it's about CAD $4/day, that's less than the price of a cup of Starbucks each day!"

ZERO improvements in redness, acne, large pores, or pigmentation. After the round of antibiotics not working, the derm wanted to put me on more pills. I went home and decided to go back to basics. I had a small amount of La Mer I found in my drawer and was like ok, what do I have to lose. And boy, was I on the hook to become a lifelong user of this magician of a moisturizer. In about 15 days since I started using it again, all of the inflammation and redness from the rosacea is gone entirely. I had my monthly cycle and only got 1 cystic zit and zero inflammation/redness. The texture of my skin is improving, my pores are way smaller, and the hyperpigmentation on my cheeks is slowly starting to disappear with every use.

The cream was thick, but after warming it in hands and patting gently, it absorbed quickly, without any residue, that is nice! I felt my skin was so smooth and breathable! A small pea sized amount was all I needed to put it on , even it seems expensive, but it will last long time! after I applied ,my skin was moisturized and not greasy.

Another thing to remember is this is for really dry skin. If you've relatively 'normal' skin in relatively moderate weather (ie, not tropical, not desert) you are not going to see miraculous results. If you have relatively young skin as well as the above? You are not going to see miraculous results.   It's not as thick as it seems when used properly, though it is intensely moisturising. It's wonderful in winter. I also use it during The Allergy Months as it helps when my skin gets red, scratchy, and irritated. It's nice on cuticles, dry knuckles and elbows. I use it only when I need it, but it can be used as a routine moisturiser as well.   Essentially, the right moisturiser for the job! ^_~"

The key ingredients in this cream are lime tea to help protect skin against the environment and sea kelp which help your skin heal.    The cream is very rich and thick. To use, I rub it between my fingers until it’s translucent to activate the cream. I then press it on my face without rubbing  or spreading it. I use this twice daily after cleansing, after essence water and serum. My complexion appears firmer and more moisturized. Although the cream is absorbed into my skin, I can feel a protective layer on top of my skin. This is helpful in the winter when the weather is harsh.

I have to be honest, I really love this cream. I have tried it a few times in the past but unfortunately I was using it wrong. Per the company you are supposed to warm the cream in between your fingers before applying which I never did in the past. Let me tell you, it soaks right in if you use it correctly and warm it up first. This cream lasts a very long time and a little goes a long way. I enjoy the way it feels. It doesn't leave me greasy at all which is a plus for me as I have combination skin that can get oily closer to my period. It hasn't exasperated my hormonal acne and in fact it seems to have helped as jt keeps my skin balanced and my face doesn't feel the need to overcompensate.  It's also completely healed the dry patches on my chin, which really bothered me. It is expensive but since it lasts such a long time, to me the cost is worth it."

I received the complimentary sample from La Mer and could not believe how little of a cream it takes to cover my whole face. The La Mer moisturizing cream takes it to a new level. This cream is very easy to use and apply. As soon as you apply the cream to your face, you can feel the moisture(kind of like a cooling effect). It makes my face feel hydrated and very smooth. It is not too thick and doesn’t feel oily. I also noticed that my face looks brighter than before.  The only thing that I would improve is the scent of it. I love when my face cream has a ”spa” kind of scent. This one, unfortunately, didn't meet my expectations(scent-wise). Overall, I like it a lot and would recommend it."

I’ve always wanted to try La Mer creme and am so happy I was able to.  First, this creme is a heavier creme so, I only used it at night. I followed the directions and let the creme warm in my hand and turn translucent before applying. Since this creme is so heavy, a little bit goes a long way. My skin absorbed the creme as I gently patted it on my skin.  After two weeks of use, my skin is softer and smoother. While, yes, it is a bit pricey, you get what you pay for. In my opinion, it’s worth the money. I also believe that since you only need a small amount per application, a small container should last quite awhile.   I received this product complimentary of La Mer."

As you are pressing in I really noticed how the refreshing scent comes up for a few moments. Which is nice. It doesn’t last too long, so if you are sensitive to scent it fades quickly. My skin feels nice and I definitely would recommend this for normal to dry skin.  Its nice that a small amount goes a long way. I paired my with my favorite serum after to help add extra hydration.

I was intrigued by the fact- based evidence, Creme de la Mer is  made of high quality ingredients it claims to be and performs the way it is intended to- not many brands can say that! That being said, I had high expectations of the creme, which were met! I love the consistency, it is quite thick and being so I initially though it would cause my face to feel greasy, but it did not. Creme de la Mer is unique as the product is meant to be warmed between your fingers, this causes it to become nearly translucent and also easier to apply. It glided across my skin, and despite the consistency, it didn't feel heavy.  After the first day of using it, both morning and night, my skin was very moisturized and had a nice glow. After a few more days of use  my skin tone looked more even, and  was better hydrated and plump. I would definitely recommend Creme de la Mer to anyone wanting to purchase it. While it may be pricey, a little goes a long way and because it is contained in porcelain the ingredients don't lose their potency over time."

I was never drawn to La Mer because I’ve always had oily skin. Any moisturizer that’s super hydrating just did not have an appeal to me but I know this product is high end so I’m glad I finally got to try it for free. The verdict? This product definitely does work it’s magic. My skin felt smooth and very hydrated after usage; however it takes about 15 minutes for the product to be fully absorbed into my skin. I love the result but I hate greasy feels on my face. This is not my favorite product but if you’re looking for a very hydrating skin regimen, I highly recommend this product. Remember, a little goes a long way so use little at a time!"

I received a sample of this product complimentary from La Mer, but all opinions are my own.   First of all, they’re not lying when they say a little goes a long way. It truly does! Even for my dry skin! I prefer to use this as a nighttime cream, as it stays a bit too greasy for my liking during the day. The “ritual” of applying the creme is a bit cheesy for me, but I get the sentiment.   I have to complain about the scent. It smells like a product you would find on your grandmother’s vanity...not it a good way. It smells like baby powder/old lady, which I feel like is so unnecessary.   Scent aside, I think this is a nice creme, but I don’t think it’s anywhere near worth the ungodly amount of money they charge for this."

Whenever weather changing, your skin always reacted too. I tried  Crème de la Mer for a few days already, and I love how it helped with my sensitive skin problem. This cream has a very thick creamy texture, but once you warm it up with your fingers it melts. Once the cream became translucent just press it gently to your face and neck, it does feel a little bit sticky when you applied it after few minutes it went away (I have a dry skin so it absorbed really fast on my skin). It has a pleasant floral scents to it, and it doesn’t bother me nor my skin. My skin definitely looks more plump and healthier, with all the dryness and redness gone. Definitely recommended with people with dry skin! Oh, and I also love that this Crème de la Mer came in a pretty little green pouch. The design is simple but always has that luxurious presentation."

You apply twice per day by using a pea-sized amount, emulsified in your hands and geny patted onto your face and neck. After one weekof using I did notice my forehead wrinkles were visibly softened, my skin felt very soft and i really enjoyed the light scent.

If you just scoop it out of the jar and try to rub it in then it wont work right. It doesn't smell great but it's also not horrible. It reminds me of a shampoo that was made years ago. I am warming up too the scent. After I use this my face feels so soft and amazing. I really didn't think I would like this and I was totally wrong about that.

The trick is to warm it a bit between your fingers, and then gently pat onto your face. This cream makes my skin feel so soft, moisturized, and more firm. Since I am in my late 30’s, I am always looking for great anti-aging creams and serums. This cream is so rich without being too heavy, and extremely luxurious. It has great anti-aging skin benefits that help to smooth over and firm fine lines and wrinkles. My skin adores the La Mer Creme De La Mer, and my skin really looks healthy and radiant after using this. I love that a little bit of this goes a long way, and doesn’t leave my skin feeling sticky or greasy. It really absorbed fast, and left my skin perfectly moisturized and silky smooth. I definitely noticed a small difference after only using for a few days, and I instantly fell in love with this cream."

This Creme De La Mer is amazing and holds the secret to well hydrated, supple and healthy skin that glows! This cream is ultra moisturizing with its skin loving ingredients, such as natural sea kelp, and relieves dryness after the first use. A little bit definitely goes a long way with this Creme De La Mer, simply make sure to follow usage instructions and warm up the cream between your finger tips, you will know when it is ready to apply when it turns from white and thick to a smooth and translucent texture and color. Once applied to the skin I love how it makes my skin instantly appear dewy and more even looking. Even though this is a thicker consistency, which you will feel upon applying it, it will only stay that way for about ten to twenty minutes, and then it will have completely absorbed into the skin and there’s no greasy or heavy residue left behind. This luxurious cream hydrated my dry facial and neck skin back to healthy, I love it! You should definitely give it a try, excellent quality and worth it! I highly recommend it!"

It's known to be a big deal in the skincare community very much a holy grail for so many.  Their moisturizer does what it claims to do, it truly leaves your skin feeling so soft the formula includes their miracle broth that is sourced from the ocean along with lime tea concentrate and giant sea kelp. Together these ingredients strengthen the skin barrier while protecting it from environmental stress and supports it's healing process but I am here to provide you my honest thoughts and yes while this cream does feel SO luxurious and keeps my skin feeling soft and hydrated, it’s by no means a take my money type of product.

It’s a rich, creamy balm that has to be warmed up before applied on the face. I do feel like the cream can drag on my skin, even after warming it up and spritzing my face prior. I do really really love the look it gives. A blurred, dewy canvas that works well under makeup and to sleep. I’m more impressed by it than I expected. Because of the price, I don’t see myself using this everyday. But I would definitely use it for events, and nightly use. I see myself buying this, when there is a sale. I don’t need a lot so I think it could last me a bit . I do feel like this is a luxury item, so not necessary, but it is special. And I would splurge on it!  This could easily be five stars, once I see if there are long term effects from using it."

It’s really difficult to use. It will eventually after some time become spreadable but it’s not worth the time. It leaves a nice sheen when it does spread.

Although you might think the price is high I can testify a little really goes a long way which is savings in the end especially if it genuinely works. My skin is combination but as I've aged I deffinatly have more wrinkles, sags and bags. All the fun stuff that comes with age. Once you emulsify a very small amount between your fingers and smooth it on I noticed it was like a velvet canvas on my face. It dident leave a oily residue type feeling. I put this on before my makeup and it just made for a very even and smooth surface  to work with. It dident make things look caked either. Im so glad I has a chance to try this out, I'm sold.

My only criticism is the scent seems a bit outdated, and I’m not sure if it’s totally worth it as an everyday cream for the price. I feel like the container would last a long time though since you only need a small amount."

That is my experience when using it for several days.  This cream does not cause breakouts and I am prone to acne."

First, no matter how much I warmed this product in my hand, it still felt tacky. Second, warming it in my hands per directions made me feel I was wasting expensive product. Third, I honestly didn't enjoy the experience of patting it into my face. I felt like I was missing places, and that I couldn't get good coverage. When I tried smoothing it onto my face, it was just too tacky. I don't know if I got a bad batch or I have more sensitivity to texture than I thought, but the experience of using this moisturizer wasn't pleasant. It does seem to do its job, I just missed putting on moisturizer like usual and it was so tempting to go back to my old one that was easy to apply, I'm having trouble finishing it. It was enough of a hassle that I would not buy this product but I gave it 3 stars because I think it does moisturize. This was gifted by La Mer."

There's even a helpful tutorial on how to correctly prep the product for use and for applying in a simple pressing motion.  I use this day and night and my face and neck area has never felt and looked better. It does have a high price tag but I will say that this is worth it if you're serious about skincare.

I'm not sure what drug store sells a moisturizer for a dollar that remotely holds a candle to this, because I've seen them all. I give them all a big fat F. This melts into my skin, it doesn't ball up and fall off. it's like silk. It's beautiful and my skin is so soft and balanced out. I absolutely love it.

It feels instantly soothing and hydrating. Over time, it definitely locks in moisturizer and hydrated the skin. I love using this in the Eve is because it can feel like a overnight mask! It really hydrates, plumps, and smooths the texture of the skin. You can still use it during the day to prep your skin for makeup, I just wouldn’t apply too much. Makeup glides on the skin very seamlessly and applies very evenly with this moisturizer underneath. While it is pricey, I find I never need much to really hydrated and nourish my skin.

It is applied exclusively after you warm it up in your palms, I just rub them very quickly, it warms up, becomes transparent and I transfer it to my face with applying movements, the cream is applied EXCLUSIVELY in this way, thus, firstly, its beneficial properties are activated, and secondly  otherwise it is simply unrealistic to apply it.  My peeling on my face disappeared after 2 times of application.  The face, indeed, takes on a rested look, wrinkles from lack of moisture are smoothed out.  I really like the smell.  It may be a bit heavy for some people, but it doesn’t irritate me.  After using the cream, I do not observe any negative consequences ... The skin breathes, the pores are not clogged if the cream is applied correctly."

I also noticed there was no tackiness of greasy feeling after applying.  Also, my makeup went on smoother and did not ‘roll up’.  I also enjoyed the light scent and the way my skin felt beautiful all day long until my nighttime routine when I used La Mer again.  Wearing it at night felt really restorative and like a night mask.  I enjoyed the smoothing effects and woke up looking super fresh.  I had no breakouts with this product, even though I have sensitive combination skin, prone to adult cystic acne.  La Mer’s The Moisturizing Cream is very gentle yet very effective.

It also didn’t solve my dry skin issue.   It’s very thick in consistency, creamy, you warm it up by rubbing between your hands for a few seconds until it becomes translucent then you pat it on skin. A little goes a long way, if you use a lot you will probably end up with greasy skin. It has a sort of soapy scent which I don’t care for but I know others who loves it.  It’s made with a miracle broth which is a healing elixir. It says it soothes and renews skin. I guess with long term use you may get amazing results. I used for about a week.

I followed the directions of warming the cream between my finger tips before applying. The scent is very subtle. This gives my skin the right amount of moisture and hydration that is needed and I am amazed at how well it absorbs. My skin looks flawless after using this.  The product is pricey. It runs at a price of $95 for a 0.5oz and a 1oz for $190. I am hopeful that this will last a month or two. For those with very sensitive skin, this does contain a fragrance and mineral oil.  I really do not think you need to apply a serum if using this, as this has everything your wonderful skin needs to thrive. The perfect product for travelling, no need to lug all your other beauty products along.  I give this cream a 10/10. Definitely worth the investment"

It neutralized any redness I had completely, nourished my skin with deep moisture yet doesn’t leave me oily & sits great under make up. I have acne prone skin & the fact that it has not caused me to break out is so big for me. I honestly feel so good without make up these days thanks to La Mer. I use it as my day time moisturizer, very little goes a long way, and warming it up on your fingers before applying is very important.

It is a very heavy cream and the directions advise not to rub in, but to pat and press into skin.  The special instructions did make using it feel “fancy” ( for lack of a better word).  I used it only at night but there is no way I could apply primer, sunscreen and makeup over this heavy cream.  ( believe me , I tried and it was a fail in 90° heat)   When I woke in the morning, my face was smooth and glowy  and baby soft.  I loved it as a nighttime cream and I believe it did it’s job as a moisturizer.  Here’s the thing.   It’s not  $300 good.  Ive used other $50 moisturizers that are HG’s  for me.   Don’t get me wrong, I’ll use the heck out of a free sample.  It just wasn’t impressive enough to get me on the LaMer bandwagon."

Mind you, this indulgence will leave your skin looking amazing all day and will absorb during the night, making you look like you just stepped out of a facial all throughout the day. I couldn’t be happier. Just got the La Mer Moisturizing Soft Cream and will compare. From first glance and use, I must say the Creme de La Mer stands out much more and will likely be my go-to for a while once I purchase the much larger version as these ones were only the 15ml for a test run.

The formula has the same smell and thick texture as Nivea creme ($5), so I’m confused by the price point of this product. Does anyone know if the ingredients are similar? I’m a little hesitant to continue to rub an expensive Nivea Creme dupe on my face skin...   I applied a little La Mer to my very dry face skin this morning. It certainly moisturizes but the smell is cheap and lingers around the nostrils. I’m hoping this won’t break me out given the thick formula."

I cannot express how disappointed and confused I am about the hype surrounding this cream. The smell is very much like fresh linen/ laundry soap. Not so overpowering that it makes me feel sick, but strong enough that I can smell the cream on my face. The worst thing about this cream is the texture and thickness though. I can’t think of anything to compare it to except baby diaper cream. It has such a thick white texture like diaper cream or possibly natural zinc sunscreen. When I put it on my face it made my face look very very greasy. It soaked in a little bit but I had to wash most of it off because it felt and looked so greasy. I am confused about the ‘miracle’ that this cream is supposed to be. If I had bought it for $5 at the supermarket, I would say it would have been fair value as a product to put on the dry skin on my feet for instance, but I certainly would not be interested in putting this on my face again.

In my life I tried many other moisturizers such as Tatcha Water Cream, Drunk Elephant Lala retro and Protini, Aqua Bomb by Belif, Fresh products etc. They work ok, no complaints, but I had full box of supporting tonics, serums, oils... La mer makes my life simplier. Now I don't need skincare routine with 25 steps in the morning and 35 steps in the evening. I just wake up, clean my face with any soap, apply scoup of la mer cream and thats it. My skin is so soft and glowing! Cream looks thick but you would be amazed how good it absorbs into skin. No pimples, no dryness, no problems at all. I'm sure that every skin is unique, its normal to try product before investing in it. Too bad it's super hard to find La Mer sample. I wouldn't know it is working if I didn't get it as present. Its definitely too risky to buy such expensive cream without samples. I wish La Mer would create promo with Sephora and give customers 5-10 mini samples so people could try it and decide is it worth buying for them."

It hydrated, smooths, clears dark spots, and just makes my skin look so supple and healthy in a way no other cream can. People always think I’m 10 years younger than what I am and a contributing factor to that is due to how meticulous I am with my skincare. I wash twice a day, tone, moisturize with La Mer, use a facial steamer and follow up with high-quality masks. Yes, I know, La Mer is expensive, but in life you get what you pay for and the end justifies the means. If it is a value for you to maintain gorgeous skin then you won’t mind the price due to the value you place on yourself. Thank you La Mer for your amazing products. Literally going to keep using this until I’m like 90! Also, the mini is perfect for traveling!"

I’ve used this and it will moisturize and leave your with a glow, it’s very thick and only recommend for use at night time.

I can apply La Mer to my hands at night and by the morning the redness and pain are about 75% better. I am going to buy another jar bc it lasted so long. I mostly only use it on my hands, but not daily. You don’t need much bc when you rub your hands together it thins out and then you can pat it on.

My likes for this are: amazing for dry skin in the winter, the ingredients like algae, it helps my thinning skin barrier on my cheeks, it absorbs quickly when warmed up between the fingers or palms of the hands. Do not put it on straight from the spatula to your face. It will not spread well and cause you to press harder than needed to work the product into your facial skin. The scent is a little strong at first, but wears off. It’s almost like a baby powder scent. This is a very thick cream, so you might feel greased for a good 5 minutes, but as it absorbs, it feels light and your skin will feel pillowy and moisturized. This product is extremely expensive and effective. A little goes a long way. It’s tempting to scoop a quarter sized blob, but a dime size at MOST is more than enough for moisturizing. My dislikes are- the absorbtion time takes 15 minutes for me. If I am in a rush to do my makeup, this cream is not a good team player as a prep for that. I’d rather use Tatcha, Lancôme, Tula, Dermologica or First Aid Beauty. They seem to absorb faster as a skin prep step for makeup. This product lasts a long time. I love using this at night because it helps my skin repair itself faster. I like that it doesn’t get on my pillows or clothes, once absorbed. I did purchase this item directly from La Mer as well as the serum."

After ten years of buying this creme, I suddenly developed what appeared to be an allergy or some sort of reaction.   Caused very ugly cystic acne.  I switched to another brand temporarily and my skin cleaned up.   Took a break for a year from La Mer; returned to this creme a year later and I seems to handle it well again (also like the oil).   Main point: get some serious samples as a little goes a long way and test this out before u commit. It’s too expensive to experiment with.   I find it soothing when my skin tolerates it and aggravating when it doesn’t.   Also, must warm a small amount btwn cleansed  fingers and then gently tap into your skin for best results - don’t rub it in.   I’ve loved this creme for so many years, and it did keep my skin supple, but one day you look in the mirror and see things that even a good moisturizer cannot repair.  I’d say this is a good preventative for early onset of very fine wrinkles (and for  keeping your face plump), but once you’re in need of good anti aging cremes, this alone wont do the trick.  Stay away from the concentrate - worst waste of money, does absolutely nothing."

After the first few days of use, I started to feel something under my skin, all over my face. I think my pores reacted to something in the cream, so when I washed my face, I could feel something grainy under my skin, which was not pleasant.

I mix it with Retin-A in order to combat the dryness that occurs when using Retin-A by itself and to create a milder smooth formula that nourishes by refining. Also make sure you warm the creme up in your fingers first so that its transparent, then gently pat it into your skin, and you'll notice a huge difference."

I tend to use at night during winter, when I've over-exfoliated or have sun irritation, or during/after long air travel (airplane air makes me look grey). I don't use it in the summer, when it can sometimes look like it's making my pores look bigger and by morning doesn't seem to have fully absorbed. If your skin is red/irritated or very dry, this is nice, thick enough to feel luxurious, good enough scent, and it really calms down my skin when it is red or irritated.   Before applying you're supposed to warm it between your fingertips = rub it between your fingers before patting it on as far as I can tell.  The plus side of this is that it reminds you to pat on lotion instead of rubbing it on (which pulls skin), but honestly I find it pretty annoying and semi regularly forget to warm it first.   This is expensive but with only occasional use the smallest jar lasts forever (you only need a little to get your whole face). I think this is a good one to have in the arsenal but not my favorite. I would have given this a 3.5 and rounded down because of the price."

When the package arrived, the cream had melted a half way so the consistency was like other facial cream with creamy texture. The delivery package was done poorly, it was just packed in small box with no bubble wrapping. Maybe the cream melted in warm weather in poor packaging.

But the citrus extracts are fragrant and irritating in themselves. This cream isn't worth the high price tag. There are SO many creams here at Sephora or even the drugstore that have amazing long term benefits with much more special ingredients. There's not even hyaluronic acid in this... even though it's nothing special, it's still an amazing humectant that belongs in moisturizers.  This cream is personally not worth the money.

I thought it was a rose mist I had also just started using, but the next morning I cleaned my face and used the la mer cream again, without any other product and my face did the burning and itching sensation again! Absolutely horrible. I definitely do not recommend, I’ll stick to my lala retro cream by drunk elephant!"

I would recommend it if you have severely dry skin, dry and/or irritated patches of skin from the elements or sensitized skin. I would also recommend this for mature skin. A little goes a very very long way. One small jar lasts for years so if you want to try it, start with a sample size. You will have plenty of time to see how you like it and how your skin reacts to it and won’t run the risk of larger sizes becoming expired. For me, this is much too heavy for daytime use and makes my normal to combination acne prone skin look greasy fast. I don’t think it wears nicely under makeup either. So I only use it at night. It’s a nice hydrating moisturizer, don’t get me wrong, but if I’m dropping this kind of money on skincare it’s going to be on a serum and not a moisturizer."

I’ve been adding about 4 drops of kiehls midnight repair serum  (another must have) and it really helps to thin it out enough for a smoother application (highly recommend).  And in 100% honesty after having tried both I prefer the nivea creme.  When it dries it doesn’t leave a residue on my skin which I found la mer does and makes it hard to apply makeup on.

			"review_text": "I have normal skin that leans more oily throughout the day, and I didn't realize this cream was better suited to dry skin when I received a sample of it. It is a pretty thick cream formula, which I personally do not like or need, but if you have extremely dry skin, this would be pretty hydrating.  That being said, there is absolutely no reason for this price tag. The sample lasted me for a month and it didn't do anything special for my skin. Some of my favorite moisturizers do more to hydrate and smooth my skin throughout the day and are at least 60% cheaper than this product. La Mer's big schtick is that their miracle brew is composed of fermented sea kelp; there are plenty of other brands and products that have sea kelp that are more effective and at a much lower price point. This product did not keep my skin hydrated all day, like it claims, which is saying something since I don't deal with dry skin in the first place.  If someone wants a luxury product for the sake of it, by all means, go nuts. However, this product is a great example of how a luxury price tag doesn't equal effective results. Save your money and look into other products that have better, more effective ingredients and better price tags."

			"review_text": "I have been using the classic La Mer cream (Creme de la Mer) for about 10 years. I have very dry, sensitive skin, and once I started using it, I noticed a difference in my skin very quickly. Because of the cost, I tried many other products that my favorite staff at Sephora told me are similar - which they might be for women who's skin isn't as dry and sensitive as mine (I would LOVE to save some money!). But none of them worked as well. Basically, I went from having skin issues to having perfect skin.   I don't think everyone will have such dramatic results, because not everyone needs such a rich cream. The Soft Cream is less rich, and I know people with normal or oily skin who really like it. I love the other La Mer products as well (the serum is awesome) and look forward to promotions that include large samples, but the 2 ounce original cream is always in my medicine cabinet. Even with nothing else, it's all I really need.   For those who love La Mer, FYI a few times a year La Mer does a promotion where a 2 ounces jar comes in a gift set with a .5 ounce jar - I usually try to make mine last until then because an extra .5 ounces is a huge savings :) Sometimes this is offered in stores (I first saw at Bloomingdales) but it's also on their website, which has free shipping and usually some gift with purchase.   With the amount I was spending on products I didn't love, and facials, etc, buying this is not as crazy as it sounds. One and done, every day. Hope this is helpful!"

I've been using it for a year now and haven't noticed a difference in my skin -- although, since it's SO expensive, I probably use less than necessary to achieve actual results. Trust me, at this price tag you will use the bare minimum too. It's thick, which is nice in the winter. However, it is too thick to wear under makeup IMO. It's also very dense/hard in the jar. You need to rub it in your fingers to warm it up. By the time you get it on your face, most of the product is absorbed into your hands. Just something to think about. Would I recommend it? Yes.

I tried this product with so much hope that it would work out, but it didn't. Lime extract (and other citrus extracts and oils) is photosensitive, and it, along with all other citrus oils, is known for causing an allergic reaction. Unfortunately, La Mer uses a lot of this ingredient, and I'm allergic to it. :( I was horrified to check the label and find that it contained the extract. I also noted that, for an awfully expensive product, it contains mineral oil. Yikes. I admit fully that it's my fault for not reading carefully, but I also see it as an ingredient with a lot of negative reactions when applied to the face. Even people without sensitive skin can have a reaction to it. Disappointing."

I am really prone to redness and have incredibly sensitive skin, and it didn’t irritate it. But it definitely didn’t improve it either, which was disappointing, especially given the miracle claims that the reviews I’ve read about La Mer often make. It was overall a good cream, but not worth the money when there are equally (and arguably better) products for half the price. Worth a try if you have the money, but don’t deplete your savings expecting a miracle to happen."

I WAS WRONG. I received a sample of this and used it religiously every night for about a month. The sample was small so I really stretched it out. I started getting tons of compliments about my skin. I noticed that in pictures my skin was smooth, glowing, even-toned, and my lines less noticeable to name only a few of the many improvements. I had started using a few new products along with the Creme de La Mer sample, so I thought nothing of it. Sure enough, my sample ran out and I stopped using it altogether. Even with my new intense skincare routine my skin started going downhill slowly. After a month without using La Mer I looked in the mirror one day and I felt discouraged because I was having breakouts again, my skin did not look as even, my skin just didn't look like it had before. It was the only thing I had taken out of my routine.   So it's safe to say I made the investment and bought Creme de La Mer again. I bought the smallest size and I am going to drag it out as long as possible. I found that the amount I use doesn't seem to matter as long as I cover (even with the thinnest amount) most of my face. My skin is once again almost completely FLAWLESS. I could throw out all my other products. I'm not kidding.  Because it has been such a miracle for my skin I have been using it on my arms. I pick at my arms when I get anxious (it's a horrible habit I know). I wear long sleeves usually to hide the marks. I have put Creme de La Mer on it for a few nights and The scars have already faded DRAMATICALLY.   It works. This is the only other thing powerful enough except for retinol that can cause such amazing and huge results. It just works like an incredible miracle potion, that is all."

I have the oddest skin type in that I have both super dry skin and acne, so the Accutane has just made my skin so much drier! I tried using my normal gentle moisturizing cream but it felt like someone poured bleach on my face! I immediately had to wash it off. I then tried Cerave Hydrating cream which I had bought because so many Accutane users raved about it. Again, immediately upon application I felt like my face was on fire and I ran to the sink to wash it off. My last hope was that half-used jar of La Mer sitting on my vanity that I hadn’t touched in ages.   Omg, it not only didn’t irritate my skin, it actually soothed it. Within minutes my skin was noticeably less red and felt less inflamed. This seriously has been the only thing I have been able to use on my face the past few days and I m just thankful I already had some on hand.   I just purchased the 3.4 oz and plan on restocking as often as necessary until I am off Accutane (and probably even after!)."

My scars quite obviously faded, my skin tone was more even and generally brighter, and my entire face looked plump and hydrated with even smaller pores! My face looked like it just enjoyed a nice sheet mask and not covered in makeup for 13 hours. Just two uses was able to repair my zombie-apocalypse face and made it look much better than before.  I don’t use it regularly, only when my face is in need of desperate recovery, and this cream never fails.

I turned 40 this year and decided to purchase it because of all the hype! But, after using it for a few months what I did notice was small white heads on my face which a Sephora skin care specialist told me is happening because I am either using too much product or this creme is drowning my pores. Now, I have dry skin (and I am 40) so I got this knowing that it is very hydrating, and I have been using it just the way I was instructed to (put a small pea size in your hand, melt it in your hand and pat on face). Overall, it does smell good and feel good just because it reminds me of my childhood (using Nivea, lol!) but I just don't know that it works. I don't understand these reviews on Sephora lately. I feel like there may be too many people getting free products and writing good reviews. As a VIBROUGE and somebody who is addicted to cosmetics, I really use to rely on these reviews but lately I am turned off by the thought that people may not be completely honest. Ultimately, it is a good cream but I don't think it is worth the price. For that price it needs to be magical and it is not."

I received a free sample and was really excited that my skin was going to get a treat. I wish I had read the ingredients or reviews first. The first several ingredients are mineral oil, petroleum and lanolin. These are all really cheap, basic, comedogenic, oil based, hard on your skin ingredients. I didn’t realize this until after I had used this for several days. On day four my skin suddenly had nearly every pore clogged. It has been a total drag to get it all cleared up. It’s taken three weeks and I’m still dealing with the recovery. If your skin can tolerate these ingredients, you can find similar products at a fraction of the price. This made me sad because I wanted to believe the hype and I bought into the image. Just do your research. There are many good reviews for this. It’s interesting to me that my bad review seems to have been deleted."

My skin reacts to absolutely everything so I tend to get a lot of redness, especially in the cheek area - this cream is very soothing and really created a noticeable difference.

I have large pores, combo skin, and occasional hormonal acne. I’ve learned that sticking with a strict regimen and not incorporating new products very often works well for me, so trying a new cream is a big deal. I’ve never loved a moisturizer so much. I can kill a zit with benzoyl peroxide and dry the crap out of my skin but this will save me and will calm my skin every time... so I can justify the price. I will purchase this over and over again and have a feeling my skin will only get better."

Earlier in the day I had some allergic reaction to another product and was extremely sensitive and dry. I tried this and went to sleep, woke up with softer skin and no redness. Continued to use this for only two nights and whoa... skin is evidently softer and dark spots look lighter. Skin texture overall also improved... how tf right? Well I’m convinced now that this product deserves its reputation. Just a tip: follow the directions and make sure to warm up the product first to activate ! Don’t apply straight to skin and you don’t need a lot of it."

I don’t really have super problem skin, but it’s extreme combination (very oily t zone, very dry cheeks) and very uneven - since I am so fair I’m very prone to redness and any imperfections in my skin are very visible (discoloration/uneven tone). My skin is also super sensitive and reacts easily. I literally saw effects overnight - put it on before bed and I woke up to a glowing & supple complexion. All redness was gone, pores invisible, and my skin felt amazingly hydrated. I was honestly in shock that something could do that to my skin overnight. I didn’t want it to be true because this cream is soooo expensive, but it really is a holy grail product if there ever was one. I got the mini since it was the least expensive. It’s a pretty thick cream and a little goes a long way so I am hoping this will last me a month. I will say that it’s probably too heavy for day wear unless you have very dry skin, but it works wonders for me as a night cream."

My skin care is anywhere from 7 to 10 steps. So I figured incorporating an amazing moisturizer might be the key to see an even greater difference. Through my skin care I have gone from oily to combo oily. Although I did like the moisturizer I feel like I have not seen a big enough difference. I have acne prone skin and while I am happy to say has not caused any more acne I feel like the rest of my skin care has caused a bigger difference than this moisturizer. Now if I was rich and had money to blow I would definitely continue buying this hoping that maybe I might see a difference. However the price I do not think it is worth it so much. Like if I was rich and wanted to live in luxury then I would buy it. I’m not saying it’s a bad moisturizer it’s actually a good one. But I feel like it might be better for someone with really dry skin or for someone that is really only considering their moisturizer as their main component of skin care almost. For example maybe someone that has a very simple routine can benefit more from a higher end Moisturizer. Yet since my skin Routine is extensive I really don’t see this moisturizer making much of a difference. Maybe when I get older and maybe I get a little dryer I might re-purchase this."

This is when the cream began to live up to the hype, especially when you factor in the fact that this is the first winter that I am using prescription tretinoin. After cleansing, toning, essence, and serums, I apply a layer of DE Marula Oil, and as a final step, I pat on my La Mer to seal everything in! My skin is so smooth and hydrated, redness is calmed down, and my face feels like silk. I also mask and gently exfoliate throughout the week, as I do throughout the year, but I am 100% convinced that the La Mer has taken my winter skin care to the next level and made it the healthiest it has ever been.

Now, i highly regret using other moisturizers and serums because this is really a miracle all-in one cream. I’m obsessed with the texture, and you won’t find anything else like it. It’s the richest cream I’ve ever felt! A tiny dab goes a long way. It smells luxurious like a fresh dewy marine scent but it’s very subtle. It applies like butter and leaves your skin plump and silky hydrated. I use it all over my face, my neck, and under-eye contour area. My makeup applies perfectly smooth and holds up longer than with regular moisturizer, serums, or primers. It doesn’t irritate my adult acne or clog my pores. it actually has a smoothing effect on my pores and I’ve noticed my blemishes and redness decrease when I use Crème de La Mer. It’s the type of cream that you’ll become addicted to and look foreword to in you’re skincare routine. I really can’t live without it, even though I’ve gone “clean” and cruelty free—I can’t give this up! It’s magic. The 0.5 jar would last me 3 months or so and I’ve finally invested in the 1oz because it’s totally worth it."

For some reason I always overlooked La mer although I knew of it I was never convinced with the price of the moon and the stars and mother Mary’s pearls. I mean I shelled out pricy but this was astronomical. Until one day I was graced with a tiny sample of it I believe it was the 0.11 oz. which samples of this brand are super rare to come by but anyways I introduced it to my skin care routine and I stretched this baby for about two weeks a pea size is all you need and bam! Acne scars disappearing my face is glowing redness is gone. Skin is hydrated looks younger. Now I’m crying because i can’t do without it!  If you use it wisely it will last, just a pea size rub it in between your fingers until it’s clear after you washed your face put your toner on wait a bit til your toner dries then add the activated cream on your face.  Another tip that I do is once a week after I rinse my Drunk elephant baby facial off  I add this afterwords and abracadabra instant results. Only caveat is the smell it smells like the generic cream. This is truly a life changer!"

And it does absorb into my skin quite easily; I was able to apply makeup a few minutes after my morning application which was surprising. I found during the first week that my skin was looking dewy which was exciting. However, after the first week of use, I started waking up with tight, dry skin which wasn't happening before switching to la Mer. I even had to start applying a facial oil before applying la Mer because the la Mer just wasn't enough on its own... my skin was becoming drier and drier. This is absolutely not what I anticipated from such an iconic product. If I hadn't been using my PTR C serum for the last 6 months, which has been a game changer for my skin, perhaps I would've seen more improvement in my skin tone. The reviewers that claim that la Mer dramatically calmed their skin down makes me think they were unknowingly using something previously that was inflammatory. For a product at this price point, I cannot justify having to also use an expensive vitamin c serum AND add in a facial oil to compensate for the drying effects of long term use of this product. La Mer also did absolutely nothing for the fine lines on my forehead. So what am I left with? Dewy skin in the first few hours after application, but overall drier skin than before starting this product and a need to find something for my fine lines. Overall, not worth it at all. Too bad."

Also, it was one of those “treat yo-self” kind of moments – lets be real, this cream is expensive.   I have to say, I was not expecting some kind of miracle. I actually expected this to be a pretty basic boujee cream that I would enjoy and then move on from. I have a really hard time finding skincare that keeps my attention, I will rarely buy the same moisturizer twice. Well, I have to say, I am converted. Not only will I save my pennies to buy this again, I can’t stop using it! Normally I rotate my night creams, but with this one, I look so forward to putting it on at night that I don’t want to use anything else. My skin is moisturized, has less redness, is more even and my fine lines and forehead wrinkles are less apparent. To say I am shook is an understatement. I also find that the application process of warming the product, and pressing into my face, neck and backs of hands is really therapeutic and helps me wind down for the night.  Really did not expect this gem.  For reference, my skin is combination dry with some redness and a few forehead lines."

I would try it in another formula, I think they make a lighter texture one, if it had less perfume. I like to smell my actual perfume throughout the day, not my face cream.

It was thick to the point of being a little difficult to spread.  I found this to be a sticking point because it wasn't really quick to use on my eye area.  Also, I tend to be suspicious of creams that are overly thick because it simply means they are full of thickening agents.  I also didn't care for the smell.  It smelled just like a drugstore brand that my mom used to use which I never liked.  (It came in a blue jar with white lettering.)  What I was impressed with was that it made my area noticeably plumper.  Although I must say that the cream left the area moist since it's so thick.  Thus, I wouldn't use this during the day.  I was further impressed by how even my skin-tone was around my eyes.  I couldn't stop looking in the mirror.  For those two reasons, I seriously thought about purchasing this product.    However, a few things held me back.  I did some research and it looks like this contains potentially irritating ingredients like eucalyptus oil.  In addition, the jar packaging isn't ideal for keeping the antioxidants stable.  Also, I have to state the obvious that the value isn't very good for what you get."

I feel that the soft cream is nice but leaves a film vs. my skin just drinks this up from a small bit of this melted pressed into my skin. I agree with previous posters, this is not the cream to rub into your skin. You definitely have to warm up a little until your finger tips are clear, then press on slightly damp (I use the essence prior). A pea size is good for my entire face and neck. I use a q tip instead of the spatula. So far, I haven’t noticed any break outs from this despite mineral oil and it honestly sinks into my skin and keeps it dewy and moisturized without feeling like there’s a layer of moisturizer on top of your skin. It’s a strange feeling, as I was always used to have to apply globs of moisturizer to feel dewy. This is the opposite, a little goes a long way. Will repurchase."

I am confident that the La Mer caused it because it was almost instantaneous.  2) The second reason is because I am dubious of what it implies with this so called Miracle Broth™ that is supposed to strengthen and renew, etc etc.  I think that is probably just some marketing speak.  Also, I'm guessing that it is produced for much lesser than we know and thus doesn't warrant the price tag--again part of the marketing and advertising genius.

Silicone, for example, will clog your pores, causing acne and texture, if not thoroughly removed from the skin each night).    I'm almost done with Accutane. I've seen 6 dermatologists and had cystic, painful acne for 15 years. I cannot believe I almost have movie start skin, truly. Accutane   this moisturizer are no doubt the key.

I had been using pure coconut oil before out of desperation but this has already made the dryness go away.

Many of the negative comments come from people who either a) do not apply properly or b) think the cream causes breakouts. There is a science behind the creation, packaging and application of La Mer. I would suggest visiting their website for more information. Also, to those who say it causes breakouts, oftentimes your skin will purge when you use a different (or better) product. This is a common occurrence. After a few weeks your skin is like new, refreshed and glowing. I usually purchase the largest size available in department stores and it lasts forever!! A little bit goes a very long way. You will also see better results when you pair the moisturizer with a La Mer cleanser. I use the foaming cream, cleansing oil, cleansing gel or oil scrub depending on my needs that day or week. Another tip is to try a serum underneath to prep your skin. The Genaissance de la Mer is amazing and so is the renewal serum. I also use the eye cream and lip balm...they are the best on the market!! Bottom line: Creme de la Mer is not in everyone's budget, but if you want the healthiest, most radiant and softest skin of your life...start using this. You will never stop and you will not regret it!!"

Immediately upon application the burning/itchy pain from rosacea subsided, and after several nights of use, the redness faded a lot (not completely). I am continuing to use it. It does not prevent my flare ups, but greatly reduces the severity of the symptoms. Be sure to watch a video of how to apply by warming a small bit between your fingertips and pressing the creme into your skin. This helps the product be more effective and last longer!"

I tried this super fancy cream out that I almost completely regretted buying just based on the price and it felt thick in my hands but it wasn't difficult to apply a thin layer. It smells good and feels nice.  I realized a few hours later that I was due for a face blot and absolutely no grease was seen. I immediately ran to a mirror to look and my skin looks... normal. No dryness. No cascade of oil. It looks healthy, soft, and moisturized. I am blown away. It is only day 2, so I will update if something changes... but so far I'm thinking it was well worth sacrificing a week of grocery money.   Also, I like the little spoon thing.

The application party I for some reason couldn’t totally get the hang of. You have to warm it on your finger tips til it turns clear. Sometimes that would happen and other times it would still stay a whitish color. Idk why it’s so complicated for me lol but that is part of the process that is supposed to make this miracle like. I don’t know that I saw a huge difference in my skin after the first jar, however without make up I did get compliments on how my skin looked ( I don’t have break out or blemishes..I’m in my mid 30s so my focus is mainly hydration, evening skin tone and anti aging benefits) However the time came when I ran out and I decided to see if I could find something comparable that was less expensive. Nope. My skin started to get a lot of redness I had some minor break out and my skin looked dull and not as firm. So I may have not noticed a huge miracle when I was using it but I could completely tell when I wasn’t. I tried a lot of different samples of products before I committed and and after all that I took the plunge, again and purchased La Mer and I will definitely stick to it."

To remove milia, you need to literally cut your skin open.  My best friend, however, LOVES this product because it's the only moisturizer that truly moisturizes at the level she needs.  Because the benefits vary so greatly between skin types, I highly recommend you ask for a sample to take home and use for a few days. Then, wait a week to see if your skin reacts by developing milia, clogged pores, or acne.  This moisturizer is NOT appropriate for combination or oily skin types."

I was hooked after that thinking there is no way the hype is for real I’m not that gullible. I used to the sample because it was really that amazing!! I would buy the cream once a year  as a treat after that!  Holt Renfrew then went away and I stooped buying it until I noticed Sephora started carrying It.  I love buying  the mini size because cost wise it equals out to the exavt same price and you get a fresh jar more often.

There are some things I didn't care for: 1. the consistency is too thick for my taste and I don't like having to use too much product on my face. When I didn't use a good amount of cream I didn't feel like my skin was moisturized enough and felt the need to add an oil on top. It's a good cream but there are so many really good options out there for way less money. I cannot say that La Mer gave me more of a glow either. My skin glows anyway on my good days but that is because I use a good lactic acid and a vitamin c serum, products proven to work time and time again. My opinion... save your money."

I have a love hate relationship with La Mer products because if miracle broth is the key ingredient, why do you need multiple products with the same key ingredient?

			"review_text": "I received a two week sample of this and was excited to use based on all of the positive reviews. Then I read the ingredients. WHY does an expensive and allegedly pure product like this have mineral oil and petroleum as the second and third ingredients?? For those who do not know exactly what these are, these compounds help run the engines of your car, lawn mower and other small engine equipment you may own. And you're putting it on your body. It is cheap for cosmetic companies to obtain and since they are so high up on the ingredient list, most of the product is made up of them. For The heavy duty moisture and protection that I am seeing in some reviews is because of the barrier it leaves on your skin. And this is why it feels like it is always sitting on your skin. Because it is!  Your skin doesn't have the chance to absorb the product you are paying your hard earned money for. Mineral oil gives the feeling of hydration but there is no benefit. There are so many better options out there that actually do the job with more pure and less harmful ingredients. Not meaning to be a Debbie Downer, but we are consumers and need to know what we are putting into out bodies, onto our skin, etc. I hope I have helped at least one person with this review."

Plus what ive noticed is when i use this product i dont need like three of my sunday riley products. So even tho its expensive, im actually saving money. I also decided to buy a jar because after reading the story about the scientist creating it for scars really peaked my interest.  Im having back surgery in a few weeks and i bought this to put on the incision. I think the scars will heal quite well with this stuff. Also after some research i found out that you dont want to buy a large jar of this. One of the ingredients gets weaker over time with air exposure. So to keep it potent you want the little jars. Honestly ill keep buying this. Ill cry a little inside each time i make that purchase but its so well worth it!"

My most recent regimen was by Rodan   Fields. Prior to that I had tried products like No. 7, Vichy, and every drugstore brand you can think of. My skin is dehydrated, oily, I have large pores and endless blackheads. A bit of sun damage and mommy tiredness round out my look. I have been searching for something that will hydrate my skin, as the few fine lines I have really could benefit from moisture. Anti aging products I've tried have left my skin dry.  Enter La Mer. Upon first glance it seems pretentious - the brand has a colorful backstory, and the product contains miracle broth and is used by a ton of celebrities. It comes with special application instructions. It seemed foolish. The creme is thick like diaper paste and requires warming between your fingertips to emulsify it, at which point you pat/press the product into your skin. The first two times I tried this I got it wrong and ended up rubbing it in, which I immediately regretted as it's too thick and really you end up pulling on your skin to apply it. But once I got the hang of it, boy I really started to love bedtime. I only use this at night because I think it's too costly to use twice a day, and if I used it in the daytime I would also need a sunscreen product. At night I usually shower, cleanse, tone and La Mer my skin. It feels so luxurious. The next morning my skin looks refreshed and glowing. Best of all, it feels and looks hydrated!  The only drawback for me is the price, but I don't believe I should give the product 4 stars based on that, because I do think the product is lovely. And because of it's paste-like texture I have a hard time using less product (to try to spare it along) because I need so much to rub between my fingers to emulsify it. Overall I will continue to use La Mer, but will stick with once a day."

It transformed my skin after one use. By transformed I mean reduced the look of fine lines and wrinkles more than anything else I’ve ever used. My skin looked more youthful than it has in a long time. I have been using it every night for five days now and I am sold on how well it works. I used a different moisturizer during the day for hydration because it does tend to make skin feel tight and sort of dry, but alternating moisturizers helped balance that out. I highly recommend this product."

I don’t wear this formula under makeup because it’s just too thick for the type of foundation I like to wear (light coverage & tinted moisturizer). I wear it on no makeup days or at night because it’s quite lubricating and doesn’t completely absorb. As someone with very dry skin, I appreciate this quality. To get the most out of this cream, make sure you warm it up between your fingers before you apply. It really does help it spread and absorb more easily. And if you’re lazy (like me) and don’t have time to stand around with moisturizer on your fingers for thirty seconds during your morning routine, just dot a bit on your face and continue on with your regimen while your body heat melts it a bit. Then after a minute or two, work the cream into your skin.  I only use this cream in the winter, but it is an absolute necessity for my skin during that time."

It takes a bit of effort to spread out, so sometimes I heat my hands under warm water to spread it. Then when you work it in, it really starts to moisturize.

Maybe my expectations were too high (lol?), but this isn't the holy grail of skin creams; at least not in my experience.  Previously, I had been using some anti aging products that had made the skin under my eyes nasty flaky and super sensitive. My whole face, really, was stressed out. So I thought this would be a great way to fix it.   Well... yes and no; it did but it didn't.  Yes - this is a lovely moisturizer and my foundation (Tarte amazonian clay) goes on gorgeously after applying it.  I used it under my eyes, too, and it made the flakiness and damage go away.  So, yes. Yes, it worked. BUT: it also left me with milia (those little white bumps that are horrible to pop) all over under my eyes and even out into my crows feet and beyond. (I was using it 2x/day).   Still, when I cut back to 1x/day I still had to be VERY careful around my eyes (and the milia are still there, dang it).  Yes, my skin is softer. But ultimately, I don't get what all the hype is.   Am I using it wrong? IDK: it's not carried at any Sephora near me so I have no one to ask (btw: stanks a lot for that, Sephora).   I just can't justify this kind of money for what I got from this.  Maybe if I had more than an once to play with, I could find the right way to use it for my skin, but alas; I could only justify the 1oz container at this price.  I'm violently disappointed.  :(.   ~sigh~"

So far I have been using it for about 3 months and I have to say I am converted!! First off, my skin is very easily irritated only during season change especially from autumn to winter. I would usually get dry skin patches, flanky nose and outbreaks for no reason! I tried a lot of different moisturizers but at best I could only make this irritation to lesser extend but not completely gone. Until I started using the creme de la mer from beginning of October, nothing happened at all during the transition from autumn to cold winter!! I was very surprised and literally shocked!! I feel my skin very moisturized all day long even I used it only in the night time together with the treatment lotion. I find my skin more stable and have less and less outbreak. I have combination skin but with dry cheek and nose in colder months. My pores are also appeared smaller and my skin overall looks radiant and healthy, even without foundation! It doesn’t have any fancy function like whitening or anti-aging/firming, but this cream definitely makes your skin looks more supple! It didn’t give me any outbreak or worsen any if one or two popped up, in fact I think it might actually help with the healing and marks fading! I love this moisturizer!!"

Just for some context, I'm 23 and I have acne prone skin, especially on my cheeks. While this cream didn't exaggerate my pimples, it also didn't really do much for me. I applied the cream by first rubbing a small amount in between my fingertips to activate the miracle broth and then pressed it onto my face. I did have an instant 'glow' when I applied the product but it faded within 20 minutes.  All in all, I'd say this moisturizer is average compared to anything else in the market!"

Yes, I think the price is crazy (and don't think I didn't notice the price jumped from $215 to $230, Sephora), but this has made such a big difference in my skin since I started using it a couple months ago. Doesn't make the price tag easier to swallow, but I've totally drunk the Kool-Aid.  I mostly use it at night because it's very thick and I have combo to oily skin (although I don't like the Soft Cream), and frankly I want it to last as long as humanly possible. If I don't use it one night, I immediately notice the difference in my glow, smoothness, and the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles the next morning. That sealed the deal for me. Tried the Nivea dupe and it just doesn't compare. Fortunately a little goes a long way, and you MUST warm it up beforehand or it doesn't spread/absorb properly. I cleanse with micellar water or the Peter Thomas Roth anti-aging cleanser, then follow with Etude House toner and Drunk Elephant Framboos serum, then La Mer, and my skin looks incredible the next day, just lit from within, smooth, and with significant reduction in fine lines. I'm 32 and I've constantly been getting compliments on how I look 10 years younger with my current routine. During the day I use the DE C-Firma and B-Hydra and the Murad Essential-C Day Moisture with SPF. This combination has my skin looking the best it ever have. (See filter-free photo below.)  I can't justify the expense of the rest of the line, but if you use this consistently and in combination with other quality skincare products that work (for you), your skin will look great. Get a sample of the LM cream and try it. You might be shocked."

Also with aging comes the fine lines, dullness and a bit of sagging. I have noticed improvement in all my problem areas. Pores are smaller, skin looks more even and plumper, and lines are softened. I broke out with a couple of spots in the first couple of days but they rapidly cleared and I haven’t had any since. I also had a rough patch under my chin, sort of like chicken skin (if you have this you’ll know what I’m talking abou)...it’s gone! I hope the positive results continue and that I win the lottery because this stuff is expensive. However, you really do use only a small amount, too much and you’ll look greasy.

The cream is very expensive for what you're given but you only need a tiny amount to use all over your face. You have to rub it between your fingers to activate the Miracle Broth and then gently tap and rub it on to your face. When it touches the skin, it seems to liquify and melt into the skin, making it easy to rub in.

La Mer is not for oil control and is not designed to help with acne, so this product doesn't do those things, but it can definitely form part of an oily-skin skin care routine! I've been cleansing, toning, then using Philosophy's Clear Days ahead salicylic acid pads, followed by Creme de la Mer, followed by Philsophy's Clear Days ahead salicylic acid moisturizer. The results I've had with this routine have been amazing.   Basically, the results you will achieve with this product will be    all the things la Mer is advertised to be. But if you have oily skin you will need to use this with other products to achieve the results you want in terms of managing oily skin.

I have sensitive, acne-prone oily skin, and this creme feels like a dream come true on the skin.  It provides long lasting moisture WITHOUT grease and without drying either!  It stays as fresh as when you first applied it for HOURS and hours, which I've never seen in a moisturizer.  Moreover, it has some sort of light reflecting properties and makes your skin look absolutely glowing.  I use almost a pea sized amount, a bit less, rub it between my fingers, and pat it all over my face.  I only use it in the morning, and the .5 oz size only lasted me a month sadly.  But I will be repurchasing it.  I don't believe that it can prevent, reverse, or cure any skin ailments, but it works great for moisturizing and brightening the face.  I highly recommend this cream for anyone who needs a long lasting moisturizer."

I have already decided to stick with such combination at least for a couple years. But I do feel like even if it is a luxury brand, as long as you decided to join sephora you should not act like what you were in any other places else, customers should be generously given samples after spending 315 on a face cream, at least to me, like what sephora usually do."

In the past year I'd noticed some discoloration along my forehead, likely from aging, and now that I've been using La Mer for about a month I've noticed that the discoloration is less evident. My skin is soft and more radiant, and I find that I am able to go out with only La Mer on my face and still feel beautiful. It just works really, really well. Make sure to rub the lotion gently between your clean fingers before patting it on your face and then gently rubbing it into you skin.

Before La Mer my skin looked thirsty, that's the best way I can describe it but now it glows and feels like buttah. So soft, and so pretty. I hardly wear makeup now because I don't find it necessary to hide my imperfections behind makeup. It's definitely given me back confidence regarding my skin.

The first 1 week with the Crème de la Mer was amazing. It left my skin feeling hydrated and smooth. On my second week with the Crème de la Mer I started to break out, which is normal while your skin adjusts to a new formula. From there on out the breakouts did not stop, they only worsened and turned into a nightmare for me. In total I used this product for 5 weeks and it resulted in permanent scaring around the corners of my mouth. Once I did further research on the product it stumbled upon the fact that it contains mineral oil which my skin does not agree with. I'm not saying this product is terrible, and not to buy it. This was just my personal experience with this formula."

It's very thick, and a little goes a long, long way so it will last for awhile. I see some woman saying that this is hard to apply or spread. There is a simple solution and trick to applying this creme. First off, don't apply like you do with a regular moisturizer. Take a little less than a pea size amount and put it in the palm of your hand. Rub your palms together a bit just to warm it up.  Don't worry, it won't absorb into your palms, so you will not lose any product. Using both palms, press the creme into your skin well. It will absorb beautifully this way.  I have been using this creme regularly for about a year. I Rarely use foundation anymore. My pores are minimal. My skin glows and my face is very smooth. I am not one of those women blessed with beautiful skin either. I also recently added the, Treatment Lotion and Foaming Face was to my routine and these are perfect as well.  They are not a must though. You can use any good cleanser, exfoliant or toner with this creme and still get beautiful results, I honestly believe this creme is a game changer. It helps with redness also. Enjoy!"

(We're talking I have red blotches from the tags in clothes and everything is unscented.) I've been struggling for ages though with its dryness and the last Boston winter, although not terribly hard, did a number on it. I finally caved and bought a small jar of La Mer. At first, it made my skin feel redder and a bit prickly, so I stopped using it. I don't know what made me resume, I guess because I had paid quite a tidy sum for it, and because I'm apparently a masochist, I started to use it again around March. After about a week-two weeks, there was a noticeable difference in the texture and appearance of my skin: the redness dissipated and it's much softer. My foundation sits batter, my skin looks better even when it's bare, it really IS the real deal. If you have red skin, mild rosacea, etc. as other reviewers have noted, this tones it down DRAMATICALLY. It was 90 degrees here yesterday and my face did not fall apart during my walk home. My will to live fell apart, but not my face! I'm really terrible in the heat.  In response to some of the complaints in the comments... 1. If you're 20-something, you probably already have great skin, so this really will seem like snake oil to you. Stop messing with your face!!! I'm 36, so I'm being more diligent about maintaining my skin.  2. READ THE INSTRUCTIONS. A pea sized dollop, rub between your fingers to heat and then PAT, don't RUB this into your skin. The people who are rubbing it into their skin are misapplying it. I know it sounds counter-intuitive, but trust me. If you pat, the jar will also last a lot longer!"

I've been using it once or twice a day, in the morning and sometimes at night on top of a serum, and I find that it layers well under other moisturizers or sunscreens or on top of treatments. I even just used it in the hot Carribean with a thousand percent humidity, no breakouts or oily skin, just plump, healthy looking, moisturized under sunscreen. I really wanted to call it hype but if you REALLY follow the directions, rub the heck out of it between your fingers to warm it, then press, don't rub, into your skin it absorbs right in and somehow works moisturizing miracles. I started using it around St. Pats day (March 17th) and I am maybe halfway through the 0.5oz jar.

I disliked the Luna oil (smelly) by itself and the cream is so expensive i was scared to use it especially since it absorbed so quickly but i find that combining the product was the most genius idea i've ever had. It makes the expensive cream last longer, and between the two products it keeps it from absorbing too quickly since i wear it while i sleep I wake up with the best skin ever, it also gets me all the great luna effects without the smell,"

People cannot believe that I'm 48 - I get mistaken for my late twenties and that's no exaggeration. I love this stuff.

Like so dry that if I don't put anything on after I wash, it's so tight and itches all over. I have searched for the perfect Creme for many years. I have read about this before but the price put me off, but finally my hubby felt bad that I was so upset about my skin that he got me the 1 oz. I was shocked and prayed that this would be it. After I figured out how to warm up the creme (to release the miracle broth that La Mer is known for) and pat it on my face (you gotta use some pressure to really get it in the skin) and then I massage it well. After a couple of days, my skin was completely transformed!!!   I was shocked. Fast forward 5 years and my husband can't get enough of my skin (saying it's the softest skin he has ever felt) and I can literally leave the house with ZERO foundation and just mascara and lipstick!! Don't forget the SPF!! I have gotten so many compliments on my skin and ppl don't believe I'm in my late 30's!! (And of course you get the haters that hate you for having perfect skin...stupid I know LOL) This cream has definitely made me more comfortable in my skin. As an Asian American, I am religiously following the double cleansing and 10 step skincare routine. It has definitely paid off. You only get one integumentary system (your skin is an organ system) so take care of it.   Plus I have read some 1 star reviews and the problem is easy to fix. La Mer doesn't only have the thick creme. It comes in a soft creme formulation for normal/combo and the lotion for oily skin. There is a formulation for EVERY skin type. You just have to educate yourself. I guarantee that if they used the right La Mer moisturizer, they would love it as much as I do and many others. There is a reason why this is celebrity's favorite creme!! It's worth every penny. Just make sure you have the right skincare system for your skin, not just the creme. It starts with the cleansing oil to face soap to toner, essence, serum, eye serum, and eye cream to make it work how you want to! There isn't any short cuts to skincare. It takes work and it is well worth the 15 minutes every day and night!"

The downsides are that, after my first 2 weeks of using La Mer, my skin seemed drier and I broke out for the first time in years.  I'm not sure if my breakout is related to using product, but the rest of my skin routine has remained the same and my healthy diet hasn't changed.  The texture is chalky and it kind of sits on my skin.  The product also has an unpleasant smell, which should be expected with a product made of kelp.

It is suppised to be filled with sea plant based antioxidants.

Many will claim it's hype and suggest dupes, but nothing compares to it (imo). My skin feels so soft and supple when I use this, and I have this certain ~glow. I started using this at 18, and now at 32 I get many compliments on my skin and no one believes my age. The price is intimidating, but because you use so little the jar lasts a very long time. I'm so happy Sephora now carries it. I'm hoping there will eventually be exclusive sets to save some $$$."

After using this cream for two months the lines around my eyes and mouth have reduced A LOT! Even my husband told me that my face looks pulled back lol. I love this cream because not only does it help keep my skin soft but it has also helped minimize lines. So happy Sephora carries the line now!! :)"

I only use two La Mer products, this one and the Intensive Revitalizing Mask, and my skin has never looked better.  I tried Botox a few years ago and it didn't work.  It literally did nothing.  I had resigned myself to embracing my glabellar lines, those pesky lines between the brows, until I started using this face cream.  I am weeks away from turning 50 and those lines are nowhere to be seen.  They have vanished.  So to me, this is definitely worth the price tag.  My skin is soft and supple and it feels so comfortable.  And finally - I can reach my VIB rouge reward points even faster now that Sephora carries this line!"

My face always responds well and I use it as an eye cream as well as a lip contour cream.  It's the best.  It's expensive, granted, however it lasts for a long time and you just won't get these great results from other creams.  Check on the la mer website how to apply it.  Just rub into your fingers and pat onto skin.  No rubbing. It sinks right in and you can feel the molecules soaking in.  It's amazing."

I enjoyed the products in my 20s but at 37, this cream is life. It absorbs quickly for a thick cream and melts into your skin. I like to mis with a few drops of the Renewing Oil (another amazing product) and my skin is moisturizer and lit from within. And there is nothing like it in terms of making your skin so baby soft!!  I used that combo last night after Sunday Riley's Good Genes and my skin has never looked better. I like the Soft Cream too, especially in the summer, and will probably switch to it when my Moisturizing Cream is gone.   Am I irritated that the ingredients are hard (impossible?) to find?  Sure. Do I care after experiencing the effects of this magic broth?  Nope. I love La Mer and I always will. Stoked to see the line carried at Sephora (please bring the foundation!)."

			"review_text": "I have used this stuff for years - the moisture is incredible, it really makes your skin softer not just after you apply but the next day too, especially if you put a small amount on your fingers and tap it on your face (instead of rubbing). I was taught that the tapping and the warmth released more of the benefits. It is not for anti-aging however, it is only for moisture - I get far more anti-aging benefit with other products. Also this is too heavy for summer, it's more of a winter product for me (and I have dry skin and live in New England). Overall a great product, there is a reason it has been around as long as it has!"

This moisturizer calms my skin, evens out my skin tone, clears up breakouts/texture, reduces redness and gives my skin the heavy moisture it needs. I see serious results after one use. I typically like to use this at night so it can really do its work without makeup layered over it. You only need a very little amount of this product & it must be warmed up between your fingers until it appears somewhat translucent, then you press it gently into the skin. I have never used anything like it, nothing compares to La Mer! The face wash is also a staple to my skin care regimen. I am so excited to see Sephora carrying this product!"

It actually lasts long cuz you only take very small amount of it melted in your palm then press it slightly on your skin, it absorbs very fast and your skin gets very soft and smooth. I love it!"
