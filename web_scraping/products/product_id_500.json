I had been wanting the lip oil and pudding for a while but never wanted to spend the money so this was great because I got both, full size, for a good price. I love both products and they feel amazing on my lips. The one thing I hate it after a while of it being on your lips it starts to get a weird texture but it's just the dryness of my lips coming off. Both products smell amazing too"

			"review_text": "This this combo will be a forever favorite for me. My bottom lip is always dehydrated and prevents me from using lip stains or matte lipsticks - it does not even distribute or is darker in the creases. Carmex just doesn't do it, Vasoline failed me along with numerous other lip oils that feel sticky, or clumpy instead of hydrating.  Within a week of using the plush puddin + cherry treat my lips were hydrated and feel amazing. I travel to Europe in the winter every year which also dries out my lips so I am always looking for a hydrating serum to help. At night I apply a decent amount of the plush pudding, and rinse with warm water in the morning. After giving my lips a little time in natural state I add a light amount of the plush puddin and a top layer of the lip oil. I am a texture person so I hate when lip oils are thicke and sticky consistency it does not work well on my lips. This combo does wonders for my lips."
