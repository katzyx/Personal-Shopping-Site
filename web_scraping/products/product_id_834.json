And while I do like the pigmentation of the highlighter, the formula is prone to crumbling. Still a really good deal, it's lasted me a whiiiiiile."

The blush is an incredibly creamy powder formula, but the pic online looks like a cool-toned pinky mauve, when in reality itu2019s a very peachy beige! Given that, the highlighter is probably my favorite part, because it did not mislead me. lol Itu2019s just so pretty & doubles as a quick eyeshadow look. I wish these were talc-free & paraffin-free & try to color, but I still enjoy this product & would recommend it if you can find a good shade for you."

Smaller than expected but great to carry in your purse for touch ups throughout the day. I love a 3 in 1 makeup compact. The blush was a pretty shade and the coverage is buildable. The bronzer is the only cream product which blended out nicely onto the skin. Coverage for bronzer is also buildable so itu2019s perfect for light makeup days and more heavy makeup days. Highlighter wasnu2019t anything blinding but still pretty and something I would use on my eyelids for a pretty glitter look. Overall itu2019s a pretty little compact that I would recommend for new makeup beginners!"

I recently had the pleasure of trying out the Kaja Face Bento Cream Bronzer, Powder Blush, and Highlight sculpting trio, and let me tell you, it exceeded all my expectations! This trio has quickly become an essential part of my daily makeup routine, and I couldn't be happier with the results it delivers. Starting with the packaging, Kaja once again impresses with its sleek, compact design. The three products are neatly housed in a convenient, stackable case that is perfect for travel or on-the-go touch-ups. The mirror included is an added bonus, making it incredibly convenient and efficient. Now, let's talk about the formulas. The cream bronzer is an absolute dream to work with. Its smooth texture blends effortlessly onto the skin, creating a natural-looking warmth and dimension. The buildable formula allows for a sheer application or a more intense, sculpted look, depending on your preference. It has a beautiful satin finish that gives a healthy glow without any greasiness. The powder blush in this trio is equally impressive. The finely milled powder applies smoothly and evenly, providing a pop of color that truly brightens up the complexion. It has a great color payoff, allowing you to achieve a subtle flush or a more intense blush, depending on your desired level of intensity. The shade range is versatile and flattering, catering to a variety of skin tones. Last but not least, the highlighter in this trio is absolutely stunning. The finely milled powder imparts a luminous, lit-from-within glow that enhances the high points of the face. It's not overly glittery or chunky, but rather gives a sophisticated, natural radiance. I love how it catches the light and gives my skin a gorgeous, ethereal sheen. What sets this sculpting trio apart is its versatility. Whether you prefer a cream or powder formulation, this trio has you covered."

I have one other one that I usually wear but this one is definitely being added to the lineup as top two. The pigment is shimmery but not glittery. The cherry on top was the stacked packaging.

The compact size makes it perfect for on-the-go touch-ups, and the unique triangle shape is not only visually appealing, but also helps to prevent the product from rolling around or getting lost in a makeup bag.  But the real star of the show here is the makeup itself. The Mochamellow shade is perfect for creating a natural, sun-kissed look that is perfect for summer. The trio includes a shimmery highlighter, a blush, and a bronzer, all of which blend seamlessly together to create a flawless finish.  One of the things I love most about this trio is how versatile it is. You can use each shade individually, or blend them together for a customized look that suits your skin tone perfectly. And the formula itself is top-notch - it goes on smoothly, stays put all day, and doesn't settle into fine lines or pores.  Overall, I would highly recommend Kaja's Play Bento Makeup Trio in Mochamellow to anyone looking for a high-quality, versatile, and beautiful makeup product. It's definitely worth the investment, and I'm sure you'll love it as much as I do!  Gifted by Kaja!"

The blush is a gorgeous color and applies and blends well.  A few light brushes of the highlighter ties it together.  Itu2019s awesome to be able to contour, blush, and highlight with one container and they blend together well.  I have similar products that cost way more but this one always wins the prime spot in my u201cdaily bare necessitiesu201d makeup bag.  Also Iu2019ve dropped it many times and nothing has broken (container or product).  This bento, a brow pencil, and a complimentary lip color make for a well-stocked mini-bag."

The reason I tried it now is because I need less items to carry around and want less products. The bronzer is a nice warm tone, not orange. It goes on even and natural. I was worried about the powder blush but it ended up being perfect because it actually sets my cheeks and also makes them less shiny. Its a nice blush thats not too warm or cool and its radiant but not glittery. The highlight is great too. Its natural and glowy. Maybe the only downside to consider is finishing one pan before the others."

Itu2019s a very fine shimmer that gives you a natural glow look. I use it on the top of my nose to add some dimension. The blush also contains shimmer, so if that isnu2019t your think, I would skip this. Overall I highly reccomend, especially for begginers who want to get into makeup."

The darkest model they used is still quite light. But let me tell you, this shade is PIGMENTED. During my first use I went in with far too much. Iu2019d recommend a light touch. And I think that people up to 3 shades darker than me will wear this beautifully as well! My favorite of the three is the blush. It has some light golden shimmer in it and the pink is super complementary for deeper skin. I like the bronzer as well, but I have to apply it lightly because it is quite dark on my complexion. The highlighter isnu2019t my favorite formula. Powder highlighters are a bit too heavy for my everyday makeup, but I know Iu2019ll get a lot of use out of this set! I also love the convenience of three products in one!"

This is my first time trying Kaja's products and I'm suuuuuuper happy with this purchase, I'm in love. Now wondering if they carry a full-size version of the bronzer.   Only cons: it's in a compact case, so if you have long nails it's kind of difficult opening the bronzer layer at first. Also, it's soooooo tiny and I know I'll finish this within like two or three months but I'm so excited to stock up on these!"

Both the blush and highlight are very glittery. I would prefer more of a satin sheen rather than glitter, but they do look nice on. The highlight doubles as an inner corner highlight!

It has a coral-pink powder blush, a champagne powder highlighter, and a warm brown cream bronzer. The blush is beautiful, very pigmented, and blends easily. The highlighter is pretty but more on the subtle side (more glow from within rather than blinding). The bronzer is pigmented and blended really easily, but is a little more warm than I normally like. I also prefer powder bronzers over creams. All 3 face products can be applied with your fingers or brushes, and I actually use a sponge to apply the bronzer. Overall I really like this trio and think itu2019s really nice for travel, on the go, or every day makeup looks. The price is fair considering you get 3 separate products, and I think itu2019ll last quite a while. Also, kaja products have such cute packaging!I would recommend this!"

In practice, that function is only useful if you love all three products and because this comes in only one set per depth, I think for most people there will be at least one product they don't love. For me, the cream bronzer is quite nice; it blends well and the color is workable for me, though it leans a tad warm perhaps. The blush is okay, but not unique from any other pink blush you may have. My real disappointment was the highlight - strangely peach/pink undertoned and an overly metallic formula that really emphasized my texture. I think if you got the chance to test these before buying then maybe it would be worth it since is it quite convenient, but I don't think this will be a 3/3 hit for most."

The blush was the same: extremely pigmented, goes on bright, but blends very easily into the intensity you prefer.   The highlighter is fantastic as well, so bright!  Iu2019m really loving this palette. Itu2019s so portable, easy to use and the pigments are sooo good.

The highlighter is definitely on the softer side in terms of brilliance and is good for everyday wear. I have layered it under some of my stronger highlighters and it gives a nice and healthy glow look. The bronzer was surprisingly good on my skin, I typically find that bronzers come up a little too orange on my skin (yellow-neutral undertones) but this looks pretty natural. Would recommend to those with a similar skin tone to me!"

I thought it would be a powder but the cream sinks into the skin effortlessly and blended like a dream. I do wish the blush was a more defined colors as it blended too closely to the bronzer and didnt look like the color in the pan once on the face. A deeper pink wouldu2019ve been gorgeous.

The highlighter is pretty but a little too shimmery for my liking, at least in direct sunlight but itu2019s good for nighttime. It also looks very pretty as an eyeshadow. The cream bronzer is the perfect shade where itu2019s not too warm or too cool toned, suits my skin perfect and also blends well, it doesnu2019t blend away or looks muddy. I like to apply a couple of layers (or more) for a more intense look, or a light layer for a barely there, no-makeup makeup look. I have never tried Korean makeup and I am very pleased with this trio. Highly recommend."

I felt that all the blush options leaned very pink / coral, and I would love to see more peach / warm nude tones too"

The formula is silky smooth very creamy, which blends easily. Blush - The shade is a beautiful coralish shade, nicely complements my skin tone. But it's very powdery, so make sure you remove the extra blush with your brush before applying this, otherwise, it looks very pigmented. Apart it blends nicely and looks very pretty. Highlighter - I love this highlighter, it gives a beautiful subtle glow. You can carry both in the daytime and nighttime. Easy to build and blend.  Overall - I am impressed with this Trio! The texture is buttery soft, blends easily, and looks beautiful on the skin. It's also super convenient to carry, perfect for traveling and comes in a cute little mirror. Bronzer and Highlighter are my top favorite, blush is pretty too, just a little powdery. Now I need to try more products from this lovely brand. Love it!"

The blush is also very flattering and I don't wear highlighter that much so I like a very intense one for my inner corners and this one is just okay. It would be beautiful on the cheeks and looks natural because it's not glittery or chunky.  I wish I got a darker shade because I got the lightest one but I'm a fan overall!"

This makes it perfect for travel and has less bulk than bringing three individual complexion products. The case is also super sturdy which is something that I canu2019t say for a lot of my make up products making me really trust this product for travel. I love the super creamy and blendable formula! It goes on so smooth and seamlessly and you can build up the pigment which is wonderful so you can really customize it to your particular wants."

I don't usually go for a super dramatic highlighter looks, so I didn't mind that plus I can always just use it as an eye shadow. I was impressed with the formulas as well, the bronzer is blendable and the blush/ highlighter is not too powdery.  Another one of my favorite parts is how compact and lightweight this trio is. It makes it very convenient to travel with and will definitely be in my makeup bag on the go."

To break it down: BLUSH- a basic warm pink shade, has some kickback but applies nicely on the cheeks. HIGHLIGHT- my least favorite of the three.. underwhelming sheen while still being kind of glittery and personally too icy. BRONZER- creamy formula that pulls a neutral-warm tone on my skin, no patchiness. My only gripe is that the small pan size makes it difficult to pick up product with my usual bronzer brush.   Great for travel purposes, and even comes with a small mirror though I donu2019t see myself using it too much. Overall a cute and convenient concept! :)"

Instead I just brought a purse and this product helped save so much space! I love that I was able to have all three products all in one go. This is very travel friendly and durable. Not to mention the packaging stayed very clean in my bag unlike some products that somehow leak or get powder everywhere in makeup bags. I loved the formula and how creamy everything was. The powders were like butter and applied beautifully to the face. Everything looked very natural Iu2019m so happy with this product. BEST THING EVER!"

All in all, this is a great multi-use product given the price."

Super creamy and blendable. Not too orange or ashy, just right. Doesnu2019t break me out either. The blush is my second favorite. Super soft and blendable. I also find itu2019s one of my longer lasting blushes in my collection next to the tarte Amazonian blushes. The shade is also so beautiful. The highlighter is alright.

The highlighter is the only part I could find a small fault in. While it looked very natural and lovely on the skin, it did still contain glitter particles which I wouldnu2019t recommend for more mature skin types. Overall, Iu2019m very impressed with this pocket face palette, and I hope to see more creative compacts from Kaja in the future."

I have a preference for cream contour products to begin with, which is why I bought this set. Although I have oily skin, I havenu2019t noticed the bronzer rubbing off. I suspect itu2019s a cream-to-powder formula. The bronzer did not work as an eyeshadow, in case youu2019re wondering. Giving this product five stars because all the shades are useful and compact enough for travel. Plus, the packaging is just adorable!"

It doesnu2019t disappear and it set on my combo skin well. The highlight was a thin formula on the skin. It looks very impactful in the pan but once I buffed it on the cheeks, I thought it disappeared. Once I moved my face in the light, that was when I saw the wet effect it gives. It is a sheer formula, so I didnu2019t see a metallic streak in low light. The blush is powdery and also a thin formula. It is pigmented, which Iu2019ll find difficult when traveling because if I were to go too hard I might mess up my face make up. On the other hand, it did last on my combo skin."

I would compare the highlighter formula to Colourpop's super shock highlighters. Really nice and smooth. The blush is a powder, and you can take it from a sheer wash of color to a built-up, strong peach-pink. The packaging is also super cute."

Iu2019d prefer them all to be one or the other. Otherwise Iu2019m very happy with this, and canu2019t wait to use it for travel! (One day...)"

I absolutely love fair but i went in store after buying and I definitely could have got the medium one which I like more because the blush is brighter. The product itself tho all three formulas of product, 10 out of 10."

            "review_text": "Wow I love this! Iu2019m a light-medium neutral skin tone so I first bought shade 2 Cloud Latte.  While I LOVED the blush, the bronzer was too dark for me and I didnu2019t love the undertone as I prefer something warmer or more golden.  So I took a shot at 1 Butter Up and Iu2019m in love! The blush is a beautiful, buildable formula that leaves a slight sheen on the cheek.  The bronzer is also buildable with a warmer undertone and it looks so natural.  I LOVE IT!  The highlighter I will use as an eyeshadow since I can see some sparkles in it but thatu2019s not a bad thing.  Effectively this makes the product and eye and cheek palette and Iu2019m a total sucker for those.  I couldnu2019t be happier with my purchase. One note:  I think it would have been better for Sephora to assign skin tone ranges because I went for the medium thinking 1 would be too light because it is marked for fair skin tones.  But it turns out that itu2019s perfect for me.  Try it though.  Itu2019s beautiful!"
