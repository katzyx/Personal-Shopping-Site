I'm a bit paler now, so I'm grabbing 01 Butter Up next. The blush is a gorgeous shade of pink and a little goes a long way. And while I do like the pigmentation of the highlighter, the formula is prone to crumbling. Still a really good deal, it's lasted me a whiiiiiile."

The blush is an incredibly creamy powder formula, but the pic online looks like a cool-toned pinky mauve, when in reality it’s a very peachy beige! Given that, the highlighter is probably my favorite part, because it did not mislead me. lol It’s just so pretty & doubles as a quick eyeshadow look. I wish these were talc-free & paraffin-free & try to color, but I still enjoy this product & would recommend it if you can find a good shade for you."

The bronzer is the only cream product which blended out nicely onto the skin. Coverage for bronzer is also buildable so it’s perfect for light makeup days and more heavy makeup days.

			"review_text": "Disclosure: This product was gifted by Kaja to me for my honest review. I recently had the pleasure of trying out the Kaja Face Bento Cream Bronzer, Powder Blush, and Highlight sculpting trio, and let me tell you, it exceeded all my expectations! This trio has quickly become an essential part of my daily makeup routine, and I couldn't be happier with the results it delivers. Starting with the packaging, Kaja once again impresses with its sleek, compact design. The three products are neatly housed in a convenient, stackable case that is perfect for travel or on-the-go touch-ups. The mirror included is an added bonus, making it incredibly convenient and efficient. Now, let's talk about the formulas. The cream bronzer is an absolute dream to work with. Its smooth texture blends effortlessly onto the skin, creating a natural-looking warmth and dimension. The buildable formula allows for a sheer application or a more intense, sculpted look, depending on your preference. It has a beautiful satin finish that gives a healthy glow without any greasiness. The powder blush in this trio is equally impressive. The finely milled powder applies smoothly and evenly, providing a pop of color that truly brightens up the complexion. It has a great color payoff, allowing you to achieve a subtle flush or a more intense blush, depending on your desired level of intensity. The shade range is versatile and flattering, catering to a variety of skin tones. Last but not least, the highlighter in this trio is absolutely stunning. The finely milled powder imparts a luminous, lit-from-within glow that enhances the high points of the face. It's not overly glittery or chunky, but rather gives a sophisticated, natural radiance. I love how it catches the light and gives my skin a gorgeous, ethereal sheen. What sets this sculpting trio apart is its versatility. Whether you prefer a cream or powder formulation, this trio has you covered."

I don’t wear a full face of makeup often, so I have a feeling this is going to be a staple in my every day routine. The blush is a gorgeous color with just the right amount of pigment. I didn’t know if I would like the cream contour because sometimes I can tend to be heavy handed with a brush; however, it’s the perfect product for a glowy, bronze look. Now for the real winner… the HIGHLIGHTER! I haven’t found a highlighter that I really love that I feel like doesn’t just leave glitter all over my face, but this is the one! I have one other one that I usually wear but this one is definitely being added to the lineup as top two. The pigment is shimmery but not glittery. The cherry on top was the stacked packaging. It’s so convenient and easy to access. I love that it comes with blush, contour, and highlight as those are the main products I use on my face… especially in the summer. This is the perfect trio to add to a beach bag, leave in the car, or bring on a trip!"

			"review_text": "First and foremost, I have to say that the packaging for this product is absolutely adorable. The compact size makes it perfect for on-the-go touch-ups, and the unique triangle shape is not only visually appealing, but also helps to prevent the product from rolling around or getting lost in a makeup bag.  But the real star of the show here is the makeup itself. The Mochamellow shade is perfect for creating a natural, sun-kissed look that is perfect for summer. The trio includes a shimmery highlighter, a blush, and a bronzer, all of which blend seamlessly together to create a flawless finish.  One of the things I love most about this trio is how versatile it is. You can use each shade individually, or blend them together for a customized look that suits your skin tone perfectly. And the formula itself is top-notch - it goes on smoothly, stays put all day, and doesn't settle into fine lines or pores.  Overall, I would highly recommend Kaja's Play Bento Makeup Trio in Mochamellow to anyone looking for a high-quality, versatile, and beautiful makeup product. It's definitely worth the investment, and I'm sure you'll love it as much as I do!  Gifted by Kaja!"

I have mine in the shade Sugar Cookie which is the perfect tone for light skin with cool undertone."

I personally would’ve preferred they all be powder especially if the intended use is for on-the-go touch-ups. It just seems more practical that they all be powder formulas but nonetheless I did like the bronzer. It was very pigmented and went on the skin smooth and was easy to blend out!"

The contour/bronzer is creamy and a perfect neutral tone to use for contour or bronzing. The blush is a silky powdery mauve, perfect for my light medium skin.

I’ve used it under and over foundation, even over setting powder.  Great for contour but also bronzer, it’s neither shimmery nor fully matte, I’d describe it as slightly dewy?  The blush is a gorgeous color and applies and blends well.  A few light brushes of the highlighter ties it together.  It’s awesome to be able to contour, blush, and highlight with one container and they blend together well.  I have similar products that cost way more but this one always wins the prime spot in my “daily bare necessities” makeup bag.  Also I’ve dropped it many times and nothing has broken (container or product).  This bento, a brow pencil, and a complimentary lip color make for a well-stocked mini-bag."

My least favourite part of the trio was the cream contour as it will be unwearable for me because it’s too yellow for my complexion. I appreciate the lower cost for this product and the fact it’s cruelty free, but overall was disappointed with the makeup itself and the detached mirror. I think improvements toward the quality of the packaging and makeup inside could really benefit this product."

I was worried about the powder blush but it ended up being perfect because it actually sets my cheeks and also makes them less shiny. Its a nice blush thats not too warm or cool and its radiant but not glittery. The highlight is great too. Its natural and glowy. Maybe the only downside to consider is finishing one pan before the others."

The powder blush and highlighter are such a soft, fine powder that it immediately blended into my skin. The cream contour added just enough warmth to my face, but I usually just use it as a cream eyeshadow (which works great, too). The highlighter isn’t chalrky or glittery, either. It’s a very fine shimmer that gives you a natural glow look. I use it on the top of my nose to add some dimension. The blush also contains shimmer, so if that isn’t your think, I would skip this. Overall I highly reccomend, especially for begginers who want to get into makeup."

But let me tell you, this shade is PIGMENTED. During my first use I went in with far too much. I’d recommend a light touch. And I think that people up to 3 shades darker than me will wear this beautifully as well! My favorite of the three is the blush. It has some light golden shimmer in it and the pink is super complementary for deeper skin. I like the bronzer as well, but I have to apply it lightly because it is quite dark on my complexion. The highlighter isn’t my favorite formula. Powder highlighters are a bit too heavy for my everyday makeup, but I know I’ll get a lot of use out of this set! I also love the convenience of three products in one!"

This is my first time trying Kaja's products and I'm suuuuuuper happy with this purchase, I'm in love. Now wondering if they carry a full-size version of the bronzer.   Only cons: it's in a compact case, so if you have long nails it's kind of difficult opening the bronzer layer at first. Also, it's soooooo tiny and I know I'll finish this within like two or three months but I'm so excited to stock up on these!"

			"review_text": "My skin tone is fair/light, and I received the Play Bento in the color 01 Butter Up. It has a coral-pink powder blush, a champagne powder highlighter, and a warm brown cream bronzer. The blush is beautiful, very pigmented, and blends easily. The highlighter is pretty but more on the subtle side (more glow from within rather than blinding). The bronzer is pigmented and blended really easily, but is a little more warm than I normally like. I also prefer powder bronzers over creams. All 3 face products can be applied with your fingers or brushes, and I actually use a sponge to apply the bronzer. Overall I really like this trio and think it’s really nice for travel, on the go, or every day makeup looks. The price is fair considering you get 3 separate products, and I think it’ll last quite a while. Also, kaja products have such cute packaging!I would recommend this!"

In practice, that function is only useful if you love all three products and because this comes in only one set per depth, I think for most people there will be at least one product they don't love. For me, the cream bronzer is quite nice; it blends well and the color is workable for me, though it leans a tad warm perhaps. The blush is okay, but not unique from any other pink blush you may have. My real disappointment was the highlight - strangely peach/pink undertoned and an overly metallic formula that really emphasized my texture. I think if you got the chance to test these before buying then maybe it would be worth it since is it quite convenient, but I don't think this will be a 3/3 hit for most."

The blush was the same: extremely pigmented, goes on bright, but blends very easily into the intensity you prefer.   The highlighter is fantastic as well, so bright!  I’m really loving this palette. It’s so portable, easy to use and the pigments are sooo good. I think this will be a permanent staple of my makeup bag, as well as the kaja eyeshadow bento trios.

I have layered it under some of my stronger highlighters and it gives a nice and healthy glow look.

First off the packaging is sleek, beautiful and perfect for traveling. I was pleasantly surprised at the creamy texture of the bronzer as well! I thought it would be a powder but the cream sinks into the skin effortlessly and blended like a dream. I do wish the blush was a more defined colors as it blended too closely to the bronzer and didnt look like the color in the pan once on the face. A deeper pink would’ve been gorgeous. The highlight was a great addition though! Overall if you’re into warm tones and compact makeup then this is absolutely for you!"

It comes in a hard plastic case that’s a little hard to open but it keeps the product safe. The pinky blush is SUPER pretty; shimmery and gives you the perfect flush although the formula lacks pigmentation. The golden highlighter is stunning and can be used as an eyeshadow too. The bronzer is my least favorite - this drags over skin and doesn’t apply evenly. I don’t think any of the formulas are super pigmented, but the bronzer was the worst. Overall, this is absolutely adorable packaging, and the highlighter that’s great for travel and the blush/highlighter are SO pretty. This is a really cute concept and I would be willing to try other things from this brand now!"

The highlighter is pretty but a little too shimmery for my liking, at least in direct sunlight but it’s good for nighttime. It also looks very pretty as an eyeshadow. The cream bronzer is the perfect shade where it’s not too warm or too cool toned, suits my skin perfect and also blends well, it doesn’t blend away or looks muddy.

I felt that all the blush options leaned very pink / coral, and I would love to see more peach / warm nude tones too"

The bronzer has a creamy texture and very easy to blend. The shade of the bronzer is a bit too dark for my skin, so I can only very little of it."

The formula is silky smooth very creamy, which blends easily. Blush - The shade is a beautiful coralish shade, nicely complements my skin tone. But it's very powdery, so make sure you remove the extra blush with your brush before applying this, otherwise, it looks very pigmented. Apart it blends nicely and looks very pretty. Highlighter - I love this highlighter, it gives a beautiful subtle glow. You can carry both in the daytime and nighttime. Easy to build and blend.  Overall - I am impressed with this Trio! The texture is buttery soft, blends easily, and looks beautiful on the skin. It's also super convenient to carry, perfect for traveling and comes in a cute little mirror. Bronzer and Highlighter are my top favorite, blush is pretty too, just a little powdery. Now I need to try more products from this lovely brand. Love it!"

I don't usually go for a super dramatic highlighter looks, so I didn't mind that plus I can always just use it as an eye shadow.

HIGHLIGHT- my least favorite of the three.. underwhelming sheen while still being kind of glittery and personally too icy. BRONZER- creamy formula that pulls a neutral-warm tone on my skin, no patchiness. My only gripe is that the small pan size makes it difficult to pick up product with my usual bronzer brush.   Great for travel purposes, and even comes with a small mirror though I don’t see myself using it too much. Overall a cute and convenient concept! :)"

I love that the bronzer has the right consistency of creaminess. I didn't have the hard time applying and blending it. However, I find this bronzer shade a little cooler for my skin tone. The blush is wonderful. It adds a nice color to my cheek and looks very natural on the skin. I noticed that there's some kickback when you dip your brush to the pan but just tap the excess and it should be fine. The highlighter is so soft and smooth and gives a lovely sheen on the skin. It reminds me of their Mochi Glow formula."

The highlighter is not as pigmented but I honestly wanted it like that. It’s a subtle highlight but it goes well with my skin tone!"

I have used this every day since I got it. I have gone through the cream bronzer completely and I’m hoping they make it a separate product on its own. It’s a dream. Super creamy and blendable. Not too orange or ashy, just right. Doesn’t break me out either. The blush is my second favorite. Super soft and blendable. I also find it’s one of my longer lasting blushes in my collection next to the tarte Amazonian blushes. The shade is also so beautiful. The highlighter is alright. If you have texture you probably won’t like it. I always make sure to set my face after applying it with a brush so it looks smooth."

While the blush was a bit pinkies than I normally go for, it blended really well into the face. The cream bronzer was probably my favorite part of the mini and blended like a dream. The highlighter is the only part I could find a small fault in. While it looked very natural and lovely on the skin, it did still contain glitter particles which I wouldn’t recommend for more mature skin types. Overall, I’m very impressed with this pocket face palette, and I hope to see more creative compacts from Kaja in the future."

I have a preference for cream contour products to begin with, which is why I bought this set. Although I have oily skin, I haven’t noticed the bronzer rubbing off. I suspect it’s a cream-to-powder formula. The bronzer did not work as an eyeshadow, in case you’re wondering. Giving this product five stars because all the shades are useful and compact enough for travel. Plus, the packaging is just adorable!"

The contour is a cream. I don’t usually wear foundation on a daily basis so I found it hard to blend and it was sticky. HOWEVER, I started to prime my face, and it made it much easier. I have fair/medium skin and the contour looked very natural. If you’re looking for something dramatic, this isn’t it. Korean makeup is generally made to have a more natural look."

The bronzer is cream and it’s very blendable. It doesn’t disappear and it set on my combo skin well. The highlight was a thin formula on the skin. It looks very impactful in the pan but once I buffed it on the cheeks, I thought it disappeared. Once I moved my face in the light, that was when I saw the wet effect it gives. It is a sheer formula, so I didn’t see a metallic streak in low light. The blush is powdery and also a thin formula. It is pigmented, which I’ll find difficult when traveling because if I were to go too hard I might mess up my face make up. On the other hand, it did last on my combo skin."

The bronzer had a nice creamy consistency but it pulled orange on my fair skin. Overall I love the idea of a trio, but the shades were all wrong for me."

I’ve tried using a brush and a sponge and struggled with both trying to get it to show up on my face. I was so sad because it swatched great on my hand. I would repurchase their blush and highlighter and skip the bronzer."

I think it's a bit odd to pair the cream bronzer with a powder blush and powder highlighter. I wish the blush was at least cream as well, but I'm overall very happy with this purchase and when I can finally travel again, this will be perfect for that.

While I LOVED the blush, the bronzer was too dark for me and I didn’t love the undertone as I prefer something warmer or more golden.  So I took a shot at 1 Butter Up and I’m in love! The blush is a beautiful, buildable formula that leaves a slight sheen on the cheek.  The bronzer is also buildable with a warmer undertone and it looks so natural.  I LOVE IT!  The highlighter I will use as an eyeshadow since I can see some sparkles in it but that’s not a bad thing.  Effectively this makes the product and eye and cheek palette and I’m a total sucker for those.  I couldn’t be happier with my purchase. One note:  I think it would have been better for Sephora to assign skin tone ranges because I went for the medium thinking 1 would be too light because it is marked for fair skin tones.  But it turns out that it’s perfect for me.  Try it though.  It’s beautiful!"
