			"review_text": "I absolutely love this blow dryer/straightener! For context I have 3c/4a tight curly hair that I only straighten 1-2 times a year and this allowed me to get my hair straight at home in less than 90 minutes. I love how there are multiple heat settings for the blow dryer,  I just wish there was a lower temp option for the straightening comb (I believe it’s 420F) since I don’t need it that high for touch ups . But other than that I absolutely love it! I completely ditched my flat iron"

			"review_text": "I really like this tool. I have a lot of fine curly hair that is quite long at the moment. I read that you are supposed to have your hair 70% dry before using this tool. When I gave my hair a quick once over with the blow dryer it made using this tool a breeze. It did give my fine hair some volume which was great and the shape/volume was still great the next day.   The biggest drawback for me was how loud it is. My ears are quite sensitive and having this tool right beside my head for a while wasn't a good fit. But I have tried other brushes like this and had the same issue with all of them. Now I simply put in my Loops earplugs and it doesn't bother me. It seems extreme but if you're really sensitive to ANY loud noise for a bit of an extended time frame then it might work for you too.  For people saying the straightening part didn't work, perhaps they were not going slow enough. I have quite wavy/curl hair and if you follow the instructions it does work. Use small sections, keep it somewhat taught, go slow and if you want the hair to flip at the end then you can twist it as you reach the ends. Make sure you brush your hair first! It's not an actual comb or brush for detangling, you need to start with untangled hair just like you would with a straightener or curling iron."

It took me a bit longer than usual to dry my hair, but it was worth it for the silky straight smoothness of my hair. My hair has a slight wave in it and this straightened and smoothed it out completely. I also found it easy to use and my hair felt silky and healthy afterwards. Love this product."

It’s slightly heavy but I really like it though."

			"review_text": "The Shark SmoothStyle was a pleasure to use. It significantly sped up my hair drying time. The brush easily detangled my hair with a few swipes (with the heat off) and dried it straight in no time on the max setting. As someone with type 4a hair who prefers the straight natural look, the blow-dry step is crucial for achieving a flat and sleek finish before flat ironing. This tool was able to get my chest-length hair from damp to a straight blowout in about 30 to 40 minutes, and the flat iron process afterward only took about 20 minutes.  While the heated combs on the side don't achieve the same result as a flat iron and can't get as close to the roots, they're excellent for touching up your style or smoothing out a ponytail between wash days. Overall, I enjoyed using this product and will continue to use it instead of my previous blowdryer brush due to its speed in detangling and drying"

I prefer to use the heating straightener feature which brings flat hair back to life days after a wash. One downside, but it could be a bonus depending on how you look at it, is that this device is HEAVY. My right shoulder gets quite a workout when styling my hair."

It is a challenge on most days to even brush it out fully! I found that with the SmoothStyle I can get my hair to a manageable stage after about an hour of use. I start with my hair damp and use the blow function at the highest heat, and then switch to the heat after my hair is dry. It does not come out completely straight when complete but my hair does feel much healhier than after using a traditional straightner. It takes quite a while to get through my long hair so patience is a must! Otherwise, it works well just like very other shark product we have."

I do wish it had a cool shot and multiple heat options for the dry styler, but overall I'm really happy with it."

I use the medium setting when wet and the thermal smooth when dry makes it super smooth and soft afterwards.. I do apply a blow out hair detangler by (r+co) before hand which helps get a nice beachy wave while drying.  I hope they come out with another style like this just a smaller brush size.. I have long hair but found the short face length layer was a little awkward with the brush being so large."

			"review_text": "Serial flat iron user with fine, heat damaged, curly hair that hits below shoulders. I wanted something to help cut back the use of hot tools I use to get straight, manageable hair. This seemed to be a holy grail, 2 in 1 tool at a great price.  So I thought I’d try it! Previously I would use my CHI 4 in 1 styler with round brush attachment to blow dry then I would flat iron for stick straight, lifeless hair.  This tool is much heavier then I’m use to. It is SUPER loud. Has 3 blow dry settings and every setting is equally as loud but gets hotter and I mean Hot. So I’m not sure how this tool claims to use “style without heat”. The straightening part of this tool is weak. Maybe my hair is too fine and short to get enough tension needed to smooth it out but, it just doesn’t work for me. The highest setting on the blow dryer is hotter. I find I have to “smooth” then blow dry again to set the blow out.  I have yet to see what this tool does for a second day refresh because it’s too loud for me to use in my house at 6am. I despise how loud it is.  However, I do love how my hair is just leaving it blown out - which I normally hate (hence: stick straight lifeless looking hair) this tool has grown on me.  My hair genuinely feels and looks healthier.  Therefore i give 4 stars for that alone."
