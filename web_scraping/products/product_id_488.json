			"review_text": "The way some of these girls came on here to lie about being excited to try Fashion Fair, when they clearly they don't know anything about it is dirty work. The company will continue to exist as it has for decades. FF exists because up until the mid-2010s no one was really making shades that included deeper skin tones.   The darkest shades were Beyonce without a tan colored aka the 1 or 2 shades that come immediately after beige. I remember this, because that is the shade I wear. Which means they had shades for non-black women and mixed girls all over the place, but nothing for mono-racial black women and deep skinned POC.  Enter Fashion Fair and Iman's Line to fill the gap where those women were completely ignored previously. There are hundreds, if not thousands of brands that cater to pale people. There are nearly none that cater to the richness of deeper skin tones (most nonBlack companies only create warm toned deeper foundations ignoring cool toned dark skin - and yes, i say black companies b/c though there are deeper skinned people all over the world, most of their products focus on being paler).   Deeper skin tones do not have the same range of options. They can't even use the hack that some pale women use of applying concealer as foundation,  because their shades simply do not exist anywhere in the line. When you have so many options already,  everything doesn't have to be for you. Let them continue to exist for the reason they came to be in the first place. To cater to the women who are usually excluded."

I bought the color pure brown and it is the best color match for me and it wears well on my combination skin.  When I was out in the sunlight my skin looked so beautiful and I received 3 compliments one from my boyfriend, my orthopedic doctor and a young lady sitting in the waiting room.  I never felt comfortable in my choice of foundations but I absolutely do now.  I will be buying more!"
