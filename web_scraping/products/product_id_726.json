This time I put it on my face before checking it (assuming the last bottle was rotten). OMG!  It had the same horrible smell, color and burned my skin!  I just returned it.  Sadly Algenist stopped making my other favorite Vitamin C serum.  Looks like I’m back at square one!"

Half of all the bottles I’ve bought have been already oxidized and sticky on the first use. When I get a good bottle the serum is clear and has a slight almost unnoticeable sweet smell and glides in and absorbs so smoothly. However the bottle I JUST bought and opened (as well as half of my previous bottles) are orange, sticky, smell weird, and pill under my other products. I live in a rural area without a Sephora so I don’t have the option of going to the store to return it and I don’t have the money to ship it back and wait for a refund so I’m stuck going without until I can afford to just buy another.   Great product but terrible execution. I wish it was better!"

I don't have much discoloration or spots to fade. When I do get the occasional hormonal acne, I notice this serum helps fade the mark it usually leave behind. It's caused no irritation and my skin can be sensitive. The smell is, not bad but not great. Luckily is fades fast. It can feel a wee bit tacky and I feel like when it dries it's a little sticky, but not noticeable after sunscreen. For the price, I'll definitely repurchase. Again, I see this more as a preventative product so as long as I don't see any new lines, spots, or dullness to my 34 year old skin, I'm figuring it's working."

So my  skin ultimately looks worse than when I started this product.   The breakouts are probably more to do with the fact that my skin is sensitive to vitamin c in general than anything to do with this particular formulation. But I’m giving one star because it didn’t do anything as far as brightening my skin or fading old scars.   Side note: the other product I tried from this brand (Mandelic acid) was ineffective as well and did literally nothing. I’m led to believe this brand doesn’t put enough actives in their products if they even have the ingredients in there at all. I would rather pay more for something that works."

After application my skin felt SO smooth, almost like s satin finish, I almost didn’t want to put on my next step because my face felt that good.

I’ve always had texture on my face and this has so far only made a minimal difference. Nonetheless, I will continue to use it until I finish it.

In addition, it really dries my skin out. I usually wait a few minutes between applying products. After this, my skin feels very dry and tight after 1-2 mins. The website says to wait around 10 minutes before adding other skincare products, and I don't know how that's recommended. Even if I apply HA and my moisturizer after, my skin is still tight until my natural oils are secreted a few hours later. Of note, I do live in a very dry city. I did enjoy the pump it comes in, although I know it leaked with some customers, I never had that issue even with travel. I believe they changed it into a tube now anyway which is a shame.

While it probably won’t do any harm to your skin because it’s a gentle product, if you want a vitamin C that’ll actually provide decent results, don’t get this one despite it being cheap. Get a vitamin C in its proper form. It doesn’t have to be expensive, there are plenty at the drugstore and the likes. Learn to read ingredient lists I promise you it’ll save you money and time!"

There are a few things I loved about it: -great texture, very light and absorbs quickly -packaging prevents oxidation so it stays active longer than other vitamin c serums -no scent -egf has a promising research behind it But there were things I really disliked also: -I wasn’t able to use it on its own as it would break me out.  I had to mix it in with moisturizer so it wasn’t as potent -didn’t give me the glow unlike some other vitamin c serums -no improvement in firmness or skin tone Overall it was a nice basic serum that seems to be good formulated and easy to use. However the fact that I kept getting breakouts and having to mix it into the moisturizer was very annoying which is why I think it didn’t give me good results. I don’t think I will repurchase"

It didn’t create any new problems i’ll give it that. This product pills like crazy, every time i would go to do my makeup whether it was 5 minutes after application or 5 hours my makeup, moisturizer, and sunscreen would all pill as soon as i applied it. This vitamin C also makes my skin so tight and dry, no matter how quickly i applied moisturizer it would make my face uncomfortably tight, and then of course immediately pill. The packaging is also not the best as the product oxidizes quickly and the pump leaks. Sadly so had to return this product."
