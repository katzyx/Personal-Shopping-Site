			"review_text": "The minis are small, but large enough to get a good feel for the products, and I enjoyed all three items in the kit.  Milky Fade's lush, hydrating formula would be my top pick if I had to choose, but I get the hype surrounding the gel cream too -- its lightweight texture is a real standout and the cotton candy-esque scent is yummy without being sickly or over the top. The oil is a nice flexible formula too -- it works solo or mixed into the gel cream or another moisturizer, or just dotted on as a spot treatment."

			"review_text": "Not sure what rating to give it because I just started using it today. I have really bad acne on my forehead and I had a few people tell me this works wonders but I hope it helps. Not a big fan of the way the oil smells but the gel cream reminds me of marshmallows.high hopes for these products"
