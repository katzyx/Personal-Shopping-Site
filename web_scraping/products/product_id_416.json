Not too heavy, but could be lighter. The long cord is great.

Maybe Iu2019m just super sensitive but Dyson air wave doesnu2019t have the same smell because the brush is made out of metal. Which I understand isnu2019t great for your hair either.

The tool itself was also frustrating in that I had to plug in, push the test buttons, unplug, and repeat multiple times before it would start.

I tried the Revlon blow dryer brush first, but found that it was very damaging to my hair. This tool by Drybar was the answer. It does not leave my hair feeling damaged- instead it leaves it silky and shiny and so smooth! I take it on all of my travels. If I could only bring one beauty product with me, it would be this!! I truly swear by it. From right out of the shower (wet hair), I can have a beautiful blowout that lasts for days in just 20 minutes. I will continue to use this product forever and I hope that Drybar knows what a wonderful product they have created in this for us thick-hair gals! Thank you Drybar!"

For those of you who don't want to put in too much effort but look more put-together, this is great and it's way easier than using a regular blowdryer with brush in your hand. It does give fly-aways, but I'm sure there are products that would evade this. Also, for the people comparing it to Revlon the major difference is the heat settings which will save your hair in the long run. Also it's super light!"

I only ever use my blow dry brush twice a week and I always store it properly. A week after it didnu2019t turn on, I decided to try one more time to see if maybe it was a bad outlet or somethingu2026 I plugged the brush in, turned it on and immediately saw a glowing red orb within the brush. The handle got burning hot INSTANTLY and the brush began smoking, this happened within SECONDS of me twisting the handle to turn it on. It nearly combusted into flames in my hand. I have no idea how such a poorly-made, dangerous product made itu2019s way onto the market, especially by a brand like Dry Bar.

It was so much easier than a round brush and traditional blow dryer. That said, once it died (in the middle of a blow out) I decided to try a less expensive brand (Hot Tools) and I quickly realized how overpriced this product is. For $50, my new one dries my hair faster, leaves it feeling smoother, doesnu2019t seem to dry it out as much, and has better bristles that donu2019t fall out and/or get so bent they become useless. So, overall, no beef with this product specifically, but you donu2019t need to spend this kind of money on it if you donu2019t care about the brand."

I was looking at the DB double shot (2yr warranty), the amika blowdry buffet set (1yr warranty), and the new revlon 1-step plus.  the plus isn't available in Canada yet, the amika apparently gets really hot, and so I settled on the drybar.    I just used it for the first time, hair towel dried to maybe 65%?  my hair is naturally quite thick, but it currently fried from bleaching.  my hair always smells like burning when I use flat irons above 300u00b0f.  I used a claw clip to throw up the majority and worked my way from in bottom to top, no heat protectant, not really trying for volume at the roots, but trying for a smooth result on the low setting (there's a cold setting, low setting, high setting).  I'm very much looking forward to trying it with my various heat protectant products like the Verb leave in mist!!"

I am absolutely amazed at what this does to my hair. i have very fine hair that is barely longer than my shoulders, so no getting volume is a near impossibly. and even though they said they were anti-frizz, every hair dryer I've used before this did little to nothing for frizz. after I've just of this till, wow. my hair is smooth and shiney and full of volume. i feel like a movie star with how amazing my hair is. it took a little getting used to to figure out the brush plus dryer, but this is so much better than every dryer + round brush combo I've tried before.

I also typically struggle so much using hair tools but this was so easy to learn how to use. This gave me exactly what I wanted, a basic, natural looking blowout. Overall I totally recommend if you have hair like mine and struggle with using hair tools to tame it. My only concern is how long this will last me, as the bristles are already spreading/bending.

I used it on half of my head and used my Dyson blow-dryer on the other half. My Dyson provided far superior results, it made my hair smoother much quicker and actually made my hair look healthier. The Drybar Double Shot left  my hair pretty straight with just a bit of frizz and a bit lack lustre. I think this could work really well if you maybe already have straight hair. So, maybe not for everyone depending on the results you are seeking. I really wanted to love it but...it's a no for me."

Blow drying can take upwards of an hour at times, so I usually wait until my hair is almost dry before smoothing it out with a traditional blow dry/round brush. So the only thing I used today was the Olaplex 7 oil and it only took me 25 minutes to dry and smooth my hair. The amazing thing about this tool is that I can take much larger chunks of hair, and I can also get it right to the base of my scalp without burning it. I also have more control since I can grab the outer part of the brush. I will absolutely never go back to a regular blow dryer. If you have thick, dense, wavy hair- itu2019s a life changer."

But first, Myhair is dried and styled in less than 10 minutes. I couldnu2019t believe it the first time I used it, and itu2019s only gotten better as Iu2019ve perfected my technique, but itu2019s not at all hard to use. I could never manage to blowout my hair with a regular dryer and a round brush, because I just didnu2019t have the coordination. With this, thereu2019s no need for coordination, itu2019s a one-and-done.  I have thick, color and keratin-treated 2b/c wavy hair about 3u201d below my shoulders, that Iu2019ve put through the ringer in the past year. With the right product combo and this tool, my hair has literally never looked this good.   My technique: I put my hair up in an alligator clip and take down each horizontal section, four in total, with the last being the crown. I hold it horizontal and wrap a section of hair about the length of the brush part and then pull it down taught curling the end up, to smooth the top, and do that for the rest of the section, then I go back and start over, this time blowing it out parallel to the floor and curling under for volume, then repeat for the rest of the section. Iu2019ve found that this process makes my hair super smooth but with a ton of touchable volume. For the last section at the crown, I brush it forward over my face and work back to front - under, then over - and let it all cool before I finally shake out the most perfect blowout Iu2019ve had. Seriously, itu2019s better than a salon and takes way less time.  I will say that I usually let my hair air ~80% before styling with the Doubleshot, but Iu2019ve done it freshly towel dried before, it just takes a lot longer, I have to go over each individual piece about 4 times instead of 2. But the Doubleshot is also AWESOME on dry hair!   BUT - it looks beat up after only a year, and Iu2019m not that hard on it. Rubbed off paint, crooked bristles, etc but I still use it every time I wash."

CONS: Since I have wavy, frizz-prone hair, it didn't do a great job of getting rid of that halo of frizz I get when I air dry my hair. My hair realistically would take 30-45 minutes of air drying to get dry enough to use this dryer (you can't use it to rough dry), and that's not realistic for getting ready in the morning.  I got this dryer b/c I need to have my own dryer, but if I needed to get rid of frizz I would realistically need to have a separate dryer to rough dry + blow dry downwards to get rid of frizz (yes, I used the dryer on layer in a downward direction (i.e., my hair was beneath the brush)).   tl;dr - not good for frizz elimination and can't rough dry.

While it did blowdry my hair straight-ish, it also left it huge and puffy and honestly still pretty frizzy. It did NOT make my hair sleek and shiny in the least. I'm terrible at blowdrying my hair with a brush but even I can do a much better job than this tool. I was SOOO hopefuly that this would leave my hair straight/sleek enough to go out in public (I knew it would never be straightener sleek) but I couldn't leave my bathroom let alone house! I'm so happy for the curly/thick/coarse haired ladies this worked for (and quite frankly am jealous) but I am not one of them and I would warn others with similar hair to keep their expectations in check. I ended up returning and Sephora was wonderful with that process"

Blow drying my hair usually results in frizzy/puffy hair since I'm not skilled with a round brush and I usually go over it with an iron afterwards. This time, I did not have to do that at all! I just let my hair air dry a little after my shower and then I sectioned it off and was able to straighten it while creating some beautiful voluminous waves. My hair looked like I had stepped out of a dry bar and I didn't have to follow it up with any other tools."

It is such a waste of time because I never really get the results I want. My hair is very fine but there's a fair amount of it. The problem is it frizzes very easily. I know it CAN be smoothed out because my stylist can do it. (But he's magical.) Based on reviews and videos, I took a chance on this, knowing I have the option to return if it disappoints. I'm happy to report that it is easy to use, takes about 12-13 minutes from wet to dry, and, best of all, my hair looks like Jennifer Anniston's - not to brag! :). I have not tried anything fancy, just rounding it under, or straight and with a little flip. I get surprisingly good lift on top, and nice bounce. I'm thrilled with the results! Having just turned 60, having my hair look good matters to me more than ever. I just feel better when my hair looks great! Plus, online meetings...ugh. So, if you hate drying your hair because it just doesn't turn out the way you wish it would, or the smoothness gives way to frizz the minute you walk out the door, give this a try."

Pro: Fast - time saving  Easy to handle  Nice power  Cons: Not as smooth as a blow dryer and brush  Less control over the direction of the airflow   Overall might be good for someone that struggles with a professional looking blowout with a brush and blow dryer. My hair is very wavy. This product is blowing the air in multiple directions at once, giving you less control of smoothing the hair in the direction youu2019re blowing towards, creating flyaway/ frizz. It was much faster than using both a blow dryer and brush, but not sure the time savings is worth the high price with subpar results. I will try two more times before I decide if Iu2019ll keep. I may return it. I recommend this product if youu2019re not good with blowing out your hair in the traditional way. If you can manage the dryer and brush, I suggest spending your money on something different at Sephora."

I am NOT skilled at doing my hair at all, and normally I spend forever blow drying my hair just for it to turn out frizzy and then have to spend more time curling or straightening it. This blow dryer brush is a game-changer for me. I plop my hair in a t-shirt to get it about halfway dry and am able to blow dry my hair completely straight in about 10 minutes. I've also experimented with twisting it to curl the hair which worked, but I haven't done a full head of that yet so I'm not sure how it would end up. Pulling the hair upwards with the dryer brush underneath the hair gives nice volume. I normally also brush is down over the top of my hair to eliminate any flyaways and am able to get a frizz-free finished look. I haven't had it long enough to say whether it's damaging to my hair, but I will say I am able to hold my other hand over the hair as I go and it doesn't feel too hot. It's much lighter than my regular blow dryer. Overall, I really like this product. I will update my review if my opinion changes in the future!"

However there are some serious issues with its manufacturing that you should know before you purchase. First of all, the product is a little heavy and cumbersome. Also the little yellow bristle coverings fall off as the device gets hot. This has made my brush extremely painful to use at this point as nearly none of the bristles have a protective tip. The item also will make a burning smell as your hair gets wrapped up in it, which if you have long hair like me, will happen a lot. Overall, it works wonderfully at first but has an extremely short lifespan. I wouldn't choose this product compared to other items available."

With extremely long, thick hair, I used to reluctantly wash my hair every other day...and would often push it. The barrier for me was always the drying process; my hair takes forever to dry naturally, but it's a pain to blowdry myself.  This tool has changed everything. I LOVE to wash my hair now, because I know I can get my hair from soaking wet to dry in about 15 minutes - with minimal effort, AND without having to use a hot tool to style after. It's shiny, smooth, and it has actually gotten me to wear my hair bouncy/straight more often now.  My tip: let your hair air dry for 15-30 minutes (or longer) if you can, and the drying time will go down even more. I also liked their tip to use it to refresh your blowout - on day 3, I can run the brush through my hair to give it a revived look."

Iu2019m not one to put a lot of money into hair appliances but I do have the Drybar full size hair dryer and now this. I tried a department store blow dryer brush.   Iu2019m sure is was less than $50 and it showed!  I continually got my hair tangled in it and after about the third use my hair somehow was caught in the motor and killed the dryer.  So I did without for a while but honestly a brush in one hand and a dryer in the other can be quite the task.  I took a chance and bought this baby and have been happy from the first use.  It is so easy to use and dries hair quickly and smoothly.  And even though Iu2019ve tried, my hair just does not get tangled up in this brush.  I love it. It is also easier to pack for travel than my regular blow dryer!  Highly recommend.  Donu2019t let the price scare you itu2019s worth every penny!!"

I've tried several in the past, and it was a hard search to find one that didn't tug at my hair or took forever to use. I believe I've found one that finally makes me happy!  It works like a charm once I figured out what works for my hair type. There are three different settings: a cool function, low heat and high heat. I made sure to put in a heat protection spray (Thank you, OUAI!) and started off on the high heat setting to get it dry enough to style. I found switching to low heat to get that coveted curl at the end works best, and then finished it off with the cool setting to tame any flyaways. I recommend sealing it with a styling oil of choice afterwards to keep it soft and smooth.   Overall, the process took me about twenty minutes. I highly recommend this for a relatively easy, beautiful blow out!"

Second itu2019s super easy to travel with as you donu2019t have to bring a round brush and a blow dryer instead you have one compact item.

I have super thick curly blond hair that took almost an hour and a half with a regular blow dryer but with this product I was able to dry my hair in 45 minutes. My suggestion for using this product is only shampoo your hair as the product buildup from conditioner can cause the blow dryer not to work as well and use a blow dryer oil such as the dry bar or drugstore ones are a great alternative!

This resulted in having to work my hair more and adding smoothing serum to the routine to obtain the sleek blow out look that I had previously obtained during the first 2 uses! I have yet to contact Sephora or Dry bar about these issues. Hopefully something can be done about it. The item itself is a good weight and not too heavy. I like that the setting knobs are at the bottom of the unit and out of the way to hinder accidental setting changes. The knob of top of the unit and rotating power chord are also very useful during manipulation of the unit. So you can use the unit without burning your hand and the chord getting in the way. However due to the bristles degrading so fast and the cold setting not working, it leaves me wondering if the unit will actually last to really get my money's worth..."

It's easy to use, but is it that much easier than using a blow dryer and a round brush, which also 100% give a better result? I've been wanting to try the Revlon but I've been burned (literally) by cheap hot hair tools in the past and thought I should try this high end (judging by the price) version. But having used it I'm not sure what makes it high end. It was hard to perceive whether this is really a better implement; it's not cheap feeling, necessarily, but it's not made of nicer materials, didn't make me feel it was better (less damaging) for my hair, and had at least one significant design flaw -- it's a pain to switch on and off (you twist the bottom to the on position; if you're trying to use the cool shot function, good luck not overshooting.) I did my hair twice with it, and once it turned out great, and the other it turned out pretty flat and frizzy. I'm not really sure what the difference was --maybe starting with different level of hair moisture? I think I'm going to try the Revlon after all, it's so much cheaper and will probably be useful in a pinch; it's undeniably easier to use one implement than two (i.e. hair dryer and round brush). I just didn't feel this offered anything extra to me, but maybe it could be useful to someone who absolutely can't use a roundbrush and blow dryer at the same time."

Iu2019ve tried doing it with a round brush and blow dryer with less than stellar resultsu2014it takes a long time, my hair ends up enormous and then I have to use a flat iron anyway. With the Double Shot I can run it through my hair and in about 10 minutes itu2019s relatively dry and itu2019s smooth.  Iu2019ve posted two pics: one of my sad efforts with a brush and blow dryer, one where I used the Double Shot for the first time. It took about 10 to 15 minutes with no particular technique, I just kind of ran it through my hair, some big sections, some small. I know I would get even better results if I had more patience, but for me, this was well worth it. Alsou2014it holds up. A really good salon blowout will last me four to five days; the Double Shot I can make last three to four days."

Aiming the hair dryer at my head and fluffing my hair around with my fingers like I used to do ended poorly. At my last trim, I asked the stylist to show me how to blow dry my hair and bought the round brush she recommended.  A) if you donu2019t do it perfectly, that round brush tangles so badly in your hair that your husband has to put body lotion on it and extract your hair piece by piece; B) how the heck are you supposed to manage a hair dryer in one hand and a very dangerous round brush in the other, in the mirroru2014backwards?!  Havenu2019t touched the round brush since and go to work with my hair in a bun now.   Just received this Blow-Dryer Brush yesterday and used it for the first time. Game. Changer. The bristles are far enough apart that it doesnu2019t tangle my hair, and completely eliminates the dual-wielding problem. It took about 15 minutes for me to do my whole head.

I spent more time then I would like to admit on contemplating buying the Drybar, but ultimately I decided to take the plunge and try it since Sephora has a great return policy. Bought it, tried it and fell instantly in love with it! I find this Drybar version easier for me to handle over the Revlon one by far. I am also able to shape my ends which I wasn't able to do with the Revlon, and it dries my hair much faster and way smoother. The quality of the Drybar in looks, feel, and overall drying smoothing volume and shaping far outrank Revlon to me. To give perspective I have long wavy highlighted hair past my mid back, that is layered all over but mostly in the front and I can get my whole head blow dryed in about 10 minutes from towel dryed, and it actually looks like I could have come from a salon. I really recommend this brush blow dryer in one tool for sure if you have long hair, I am not sure how well it works on short hair as the brush itself is quite large."

My super curly, frizzy hair always comes out of a blow dryer/round brush section eerily reminiscent of a troll doll. This thing, however, is my new miracle tool. My first try, styled with blow dry assist and relaxing cream, came out smooth, bouncy, and voluminous. No learning curve to using, no problem holding it above my head to get volume at the roots, and no major tangles or snares. This thing is amazing! The hotter heat setting definitely produced smoother hair than the lower, obviously, but it is fairly hot! However, I both expect and hope that it would be, so this is not a downside. It produced a blowout my stylist would be proud of, first attempt, and that's saying something! If you have curly, frizzy, crazy hair like me, this will be your holy grail."

My hair is long and thick and I could never get the hang of a blow out with a dryer and brush that came out the way I wanted. I've gotten close but it's too much work.  I'm a realist, so I wasn't expecting a miracle. I knew I would to have to use a blow dryer or air dry some first because of my hair type. As long as you're okay with that this is a great product. It's efficient and fool proof - I don't think it's possible to mess up. Takes some practice for specific styling but it's easy to pick up. I prefer to let my hair air dry and I use this when damp and I'm done in less than 15 minutes. This thing is comically huge in real life, but it's perfect for my long hair. Not sure it would work for very short hair. I normally always have bristle issues - it's been a month of use every other day and no problem yet."

I wasnu2019t so sure about the whole dryer brush thing and thought that there was no way that I could get a good blow dry with this type of product. I was very used to my Chi blow dryer and my Sephora round brush. But I could never get a great blowout and always had to use a flat iron or a large barrel curling iron to finish my style. I didnu2019t wanna dish out 150 bucks on something that I wasnu2019t sure about, so I found one at a discount store that was only $30 but was a Generic type brand.  I tried it out and fell in love with the product. It eliminates the need for the follow up flat iron ore curling iron and cuts down on the amount of time it takes to dry. Plus itu2019s so much easier than having to hold The blow dryer with one hand and spin the round brush with the other.  I bought this product because I was so impressed with the cheapie that I thought that I would get tremendous results. Well this product does work well. I did not see that big a difference in the $30 item versus $150 item. Both give me about the same result. Overall I would say that dryer brushes are awesome. But I only gave this 3 stars because of the price. You can get a good result with something far cheaper."

I couldn't take it. I was so excited about this and I thought maybe mine was just defective so I took it back and had them plug in a new one to see if it would also make the loud noise, which it did. So I returned it. Definitely do not waste your money on this. I would go 1 of 2 ways if you're looking for a good product: get the revlon which is substantially less expensive and most definitely better bang for your buck; or invest in the Dyson airwrap. I originally purchased this thinking it would be a good compromise between the 2 (Dyson and Revlon). But honestly, after trying this, I went ahead and got the Dyson and it is worth every penny. The quality is THERE. And if you think about it, you get 8 attachments, which comes out to be a good deal if you ask me. $550 for 8 attachments and a truly unique, high tech, high quality product, or $150 for this Revlon-rip off piece of junk. The dyson will replace most all of your other hair products and is a major win over this think."

I have pretty smooth, easy-to-brush hair, so it's not a case of having course or difficult hair. Unfortunately, I'm going to have to return this and go on the hunt for something similar but more sturdy. Other things I did like is the grip, cord length, and cooler tip.

So then I would have to use a flat iron, and the whole process would take me 35 min. And if I wanted any curl in my hair at the ends, I'd then have a curling iron that I'd sometimes used to get it right. This blow-dryer is nothing but magic. I can now start with a head of hair straight from the shower and end up looking like my hair was professionally blown out in 25 minutes. 1 step. And, the next morning I'll use it to re-fresh my hair (only spend 5 minutes) to get the sleep kinks out and it looks even more fabulous. No frizz! No flat iron needed! This blow dryer has finally made straight hair easy for me. I use bumble and bumble all style blow dry and finish with bumble and bumble soft texture finishing spray. I think I sold 4 the first time I used this at the gym. I have no idea how it will hold up with time, but so far it is nothing short of perfection. Not too heavy, love the part on top so I can hold with both hands, and the cool setting is perfect to cool yourself off when done."

I bought this because Iu2019m tired of holding a dryer and brush. Simplicity.  There are three temps hot, med and cold. The hot toasts ears so be careful. Iu2019m using the med and it does take just as long as a dryer. Not keen on using the hot as my hair is fine and color treated. I am using a heat product but Iu2019m doubting that can completely stop damage on high heat. The cold does work, it just takes the brush a few min to change temps.   Gives great body to hair but it took me awhile to figure out how to get body at top of my head. Think rollers. Same principle applies with the brush. My hair is smooth it does look like a blow out. I just wish Sephora would give a 60 day trial. I blow my hair out once a week so Iu2019ve only used it 3 times and 30 days is almost up."

I normally section my hair to make the blow drying easier and can get smooth, frizz free hair in about 15 minutes and be out the door. This brush works so well that I don't have to go back in with a flat iron to smooth anything out after I'm done blow drying. For all the amateur's in blowdrying out there, I highly suggest you pick this up if you want smooth, frizz-free hair that doesn't require much technique or time."

If that sounds like you then consider trying this brush instead. My hair is not thick nor thin, naturally straight and there by naturally FLAT. Itu2019s collarbone in length and fairly fine. I never would shower before work because blow drying + using some heated tool was always too much. Now I shower all the time before work. This brush dries and smooths hair all while creating volume at the root. The volume part is the big winner for me since my hair is naturally so flat. After using this I donu2019t need to apply any other hot tool, I can just leave the house as is! Would totally recommend this as a time saver and at home blow out. Iu2019m not sure how it compares to cheaper brands, but I can definitely say I would send money on this one."

I have been used it for several days and my hair is completely flat to my hair and full of static.  The Revlon dryer never created static.  To be really, really honest, they both perform exactly the same.  The Drybar is maybe a tiny amount quieter, and the barrel doesn't get quite as hot. Also I have a hard time spinning the barrel on the Drybar one.  It doesn't turn as easily as the Revlon one.  But, all of that is water under the bridge because STATIC.  Sure, I could douse my hair in silicone but I don't want to do that. I have never needed to before.  I literally changed nothing else about my routine except from the Revlon dryer to this one and my hair is plastered to my head with static.  I thought it was just an off day, so I tried it again for several more days just to be met with static, static, and more static.  So, sadly this is going back and I'll buy another $40 Revlon dryer."

What I do is put it in a hair turban for about 30 mins and then use this wonderful device and 5 mins later Iu2019m DONE. I have long hair (just above my buttocks). Normally, with a normal blowdryer, like for example the Buttercup   round brush   layers, it takes me about 20  minutes to dry my hair from the same state (30 mins in hair turban). No need to layer, can do bigger streaks at a time, this is perfect. Itu2019s a bit noisier than the Buttercup, but not by much. The only thing I wish was that there would be a u201ccold shotu201d button kind of like on standard blowdryers but the only way is to use your other hand and reach for the cool option and then go back to the warm. And only 2 warm settings. And there are less options than standard blowdryers. But this is definitely great for those of us who donu2019t always have time to style our hair and just need to dry it. The handle is a bit on the big side, but really a great purchase overall. Definitely worth it."

Occasionally I will need a couple passes from a flatiron for frizz and flyaways. Works well for drying, volume, and minimal straightening. Can get a slight curl at the end, but nothing dramatic. Is it nice? Yes. Is it necessary? No. Is it 4-5x better than the Revlon as the price would suggest? Debatable. This does have a better warranty I think but still...it is a LOT pricier for a non-essential tool. See if you can try this at a Drybar or dept. store before committing.

As an avid hair dryer and total idiot when it comes to using a round brush I was excited to finally pull the trigger and buy this. My first one was a lemon and burnt out after a few minutes of use. The second one is fantastic, BUT the soft bristles are definitely bending and it definitely does not cut the drying time in half. With my normal blow dryer it would take me 8-10min and with this it was a solid 13-18min. I also feel like for the future, they need to redesign to get better coverage to get the roots since they're hard to dry right now, but overall this was a good buy and I'm totally in love!"

With the double shot I can go from soaking wet hair to smooth,straight hair in 25 mins! After the first use I was IN LOVE! I did think it was quite noisy and had a strange sound on times.  Fast forward to my 3rd use, about 10 days after owning it ... it completely died 15 mins into my styling. I reset it, let it cool down, tried different outlets...... ITS DEAD! I will return it and get a new one ... really hoping it was a lemon because I donu2019t know how i will love without it."

I  have shoulder length, fine textured hair in great condition- I don't color it. I usually blow dry with a separate round brush (to add body) and turn the ends under with a curling iron. I was hoping I could ditch the brush, and get the same results with this dryer. I tried it on several settings, but all it did was hyper-straighten any wave or bounce out of my hair, and leave it super-resistant to the curling iron.   My results were (for the price) a one-star sad trumpet. But I still gave it 3 stars, because I could imagine it working for someone with curly, unruly hair, who wanted to flatten and straighten their hair."

My hair is super bouncy after using it, and it lasts. I also love the Dyson styler for the innovative curling heads, and the straight brushes are also awesome, but gives a more natural blowout, which is also nice. But the Drybar one gives a toooon of volume and the style is more polished. My hair dried in no time, and I found the tool easy to use. This is awesome. I am super challenged with styling my hair with just a brush and dryer, so having all these tools help me stay polished and well put together. I love both the Dyson styler and this Drybar brush, with slightly liking this Drybar more than the Dyson straight/smooth head brushes :-) I love the Dyson more for easy, damage-free curling (versus a hot iron). I hope this helps!"

Again, the settings dial is awkward.  I have mid-length curly hair and I think the styling effect is too harsh.  It made my hair flat and fly away, pulling out all the curl (I want volume and some curl), which leaves me with no alternative but to return the item.

First, I will say that I donu2019t have the type of hair that will be sleek and polished just from a blow out. That said, I do think that the double shot did a pretty good job blowing my hair out straighter than it would if it air dried. It also simplified the process because I didnu2019t have to hold a brush in one hand and a blow dryer in the other. I also noticed that this doesnu2019t get THAT hot - the buttercup gets way hotter. Iu2019m not saying thatu2019s necessarily a bad thing because it would probably be difficult to handle if it got really hot.   A few cons: I am concerned about the longevity of the boar bristles that enable you to get some tension while blow drying. After the first use they do seem a bit frazzled so Iu2019m not sure what the shelf life of this will be. If those bristles become super tangled youu2019ll pretty much have to toss it. Second, and perhaps not that big of a deal, I find this thing to be borderline deafening in my ear when I dry sections in front of my face.   Overall, I like it and would recommend trying it out, but I donu2019t think it achieves the same results as a traditional blowout with a round brush."

I did love the idea of having just 1 tool to blow dry my hair so I decided to try this one. This one takes a few minutes longer to dry than the Revlon, mainly because it doesnu2019t get as hot (which to me is a good thing). It is also lighter in weight and gives an unbelievable bounce/volume. Overall I am quite happy with it. Reasons why Iu2019m giving it 4 and not 5 stars is: #1 - at $150, price is a bit steep, if this would be close to $100, I would think itu2019s a great value. #2 - I still think the hair looks healthier when you blow dry with a traditional blow dryer!"

I notice two major differences which, for me, warrant the additional expense. (1) This doesnu2019t get as hot on the low setting, so it doesnu2019t scorch my fine hair and it leaves it really smooth. (2) The barrel is slightly smaller, so it curls my ends a bit as opposed to just making them flip out 70s style. I subtracted one star for the noise and the fact that the cool setting isnu2019t a button but I otherwise recommend this one over other popular brands if itu2019s within your budget."

My biggest concern was my curly roots, which got blown out a bit, but I still had to run over them with a straightening iron. That was to be expected, since my roots are stubbornly curly.  For my curly girls, I highly recommend this dryer! It surprised me, someone who ordered this with extreme skepticism. I love it!"

It does take a little bit of practice but once you have it down you wonu2019t be able to go without it.

I mean, I love a good blowdryer, but round brushing is a struggle. So it's super nice being able to use 1 tool. Honestly, I grew up using my mom's version of this brush that never got hot enough which took forever to blowdry. I love how hot this tool gets. And I'm serious when I say that it gets hot, so be careful! What else I also like is that the barrel isn't as wide as some of the other ones that are out there. I mean, it's definitely not a narrow barrel but it's definitely is easier to use on my shorter hair. It's actually pretty comfortable on my hands too. I'm pretty much very happy with this new addition to my hair tools collection. :)"

The two types of bristles grip my hair well so I don't have to hold the ends, and it leaves my hair extremely smooth, soft, and shiny. Plus, it easily straightened the curls at my roots and even the shorter pieces of hair. It gave me a decent amount of body (though my second-day hair was very flat), too. It's LOUD, but I got used to it pretty quickly."

Both times Iu2019ve used it I have been able to maintain the results for 4 days before having to wash and restyle.

Thatu2019s just one thing I did t like about the Revlon one, with the weight of the brush and the weight of my hair my arms and wrists would hurt 10 minutes in. This brush stands out. My arms didnu2019t hurt, my hair dried straight and it didnu2019t feel like my hair itself was fried. The Revlon brush made my hair feel fried, it dried it out and it smelled like it was frying my hair in the process. The Double Shot blow dry brush left my hair smooth and soft.
