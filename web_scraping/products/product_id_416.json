I could do a great job in 20-30 minutes, which is amazing for me. The little yellow bits at the end of some of the bristles would come off and show up in my hair lol. Not too heavy, but could be lighter. The long cord is great. After almost a year (11 months), it is smoking more than I’m comfortable with, so I’m looking into another blow dryer like Shark style. Unsure how long blow dryers are supposed to last"

I find it's best if you wait until your hair is just lightly damp so that you only need to use it for a few minutes. It does a great job of straightening and adding volume to my mid-length, fine hair. I did find the bristles flattened out quite a bit fairly early on, but that didn't seem to reduce the tool's effectiveness at all. The cord is the absolute worst though. For such a pricey tool, it should come with a much better cord. Overall, worth the purchase."

I never used it on soaking wet hair, I never got it clogged. It’s the same smell that comes out of my dry bar hair dryer. It’s terrible. Maybe I’m just super sensitive but Dyson air wave doesn’t have the same smell because the brush is made out of metal. Which I understand isn’t great for your hair either. Pick your poison I supposed.

I tried the Revlon blow dryer brush first, but found that it was very damaging to my hair. This tool by Drybar was the answer. It does not leave my hair feeling damaged- instead it leaves it silky and shiny and so smooth! I take it on all of my travels. If I could only bring one beauty product with me, it would be this!! I truly swear by it. From right out of the shower (wet hair), I can have a beautiful blowout that lasts for days in just 20 minutes. I will continue to use this product forever and I hope that Drybar knows what a wonderful product they have created in this for us thick-hair gals! Thank you Drybar!"

For those of you who don't want to put in too much effort but look more put-together, this is great and it's way easier than using a regular blowdryer with brush in your hand. It does give fly-aways, but I'm sure there are products that would evade this.

When it was time for a new blow dry brush I decided to “upgrade” to the Dry Bar as I am a big fan of many of their products… let me tell you I am SHOCKED at my experience. Not only is the price way too high for almost zero difference from it’s competition, this tool randomly stopped working after 2 months of use. I only ever use my blow dry brush twice a week and I always store it properly. A week after it didn’t turn on, I decided to try one more time to see if maybe it was a bad outlet or something… I plugged the brush in, turned it on and immediately saw a glowing red orb within the brush. The handle got burning hot INSTANTLY and the brush began smoking, this happened within SECONDS of me twisting the handle to turn it on. It nearly combusted into flames in my hand. I have no idea how such a poorly-made, dangerous product made it’s way onto the market, especially by a brand like Dry Bar. I’ve read way too many other reviews about dangerously defective brushes, this item should be pulled until Dry Bar can fix the issues this tool clearly has!"

I love the look of a good blowout with a round brush but honestly don’t have the patience (or arm strength) to do it at home. This brush has completely changed that!  It dries my hair in half the time and it looks like a professional blowout every time!  I used to have the Revlon version but it got really hot and was painfully loud. I don’t have either of those issues with the Drybar version!  Highly recommend!"

It was so much easier than a round brush and traditional blow dryer. That said, once it died (in the middle of a blow out) I decided to try a less expensive brand (Hot Tools) and I quickly realized how overpriced this product is. For $50, my new one dries my hair faster, leaves it feeling smoother, doesn’t seem to dry it out as much, and has better bristles that don’t fall out and/or get so bent they become useless. So, overall, no beef with this product specifically, but you don’t need to spend this kind of money on it if you don’t care about the brand."

I was looking at the DB double shot (2yr warranty), the amika blowdry buffet set (1yr warranty), and the new revlon 1-step plus.  the plus isn't available in Canada yet, the amika apparently gets really hot, and so I settled on the drybar.    I just used it for the first time, hair towel dried to maybe 65%?  my hair is naturally quite thick, but it currently fried from bleaching.  my hair always smells like burning when I use flat irons above 300°f.  I used a claw clip to throw up the majority and worked my way from in bottom to top, no heat protectant, not really trying for volume at the roots, but trying for a smooth result on the low setting (there's a cold setting, low setting, high setting).  I'm very much looking forward to trying it with my various heat protectant products like the Verb leave in mist!!"

My hair is shoulder length and I feel like it is too big for my hair length. My hair does not get voluminous like with other dryer brushes. With this brush, it drys my hair quickly, flattens, and straightens but it does not smooth so I have a lot of flyaways. With other dryers, my hair feels fresh and hydrated afterward. With the Double Shot, it feels dry and lifeless. If I can return this, I will. Or will give away."

I am absolutely amazed at what this does to my hair. i have very fine hair that is barely longer than my shoulders, so no getting volume is a near impossibly. and even though they said they were anti-frizz, every hair dryer I've used before this did little to nothing for frizz. after I've just of this till, wow. my hair is smooth and shiney and full of volume. i feel like a movie star with how amazing my hair is. it took a little getting used to to figure out the brush plus dryer, but this is so much better than every dryer + round brush combo I've tried before. I can actually have a blowout last for days now. it's amazing."

I used it on half of my head and used my Dyson blow-dryer on the other half. My Dyson provided far superior results, it made my hair smoother much quicker and actually made my hair look healthier. The Drybar Double Shot left  my hair pretty straight with just a bit of frizz and a bit lack lustre. I think this could work really well if you maybe already have straight hair.

Blow drying can take upwards of an hour at times, so I usually wait until my hair is almost dry before smoothing it out with a traditional blow dry/round brush. So the only thing I used today was the Olaplex 7 oil and it only took me 25 minutes to dry and smooth my hair. The amazing thing about this tool is that I can take much larger chunks of hair, and I can also get it right to the base of my scalp without burning it. I also have more control since I can grab the outer part of the brush. I will absolutely never go back to a regular blow dryer. If you have thick, dense, wavy hair- it’s a life changer."

			"review_text": "This thing has changed my life. I would rate it 10/5 except that after only a year it shows some *serious* wear and tear.   But first, Myhair is dried and styled in less than 10 minutes. I couldn’t believe it the first time I used it, and it’s only gotten better as I’ve perfected my technique, but it’s not at all hard to use. I could never manage to blowout my hair with a regular dryer and a round brush, because I just didn’t have the coordination. With this, there’s no need for coordination, it’s a one-and-done.  I have thick, color and keratin-treated 2b/c wavy hair about 3” below my shoulders, that I’ve put through the ringer in the past year. With the right product combo and this tool, my hair has literally never looked this good.   My technique: I put my hair up in an alligator clip and take down each horizontal section, four in total, with the last being the crown. I hold it horizontal and wrap a section of hair about the length of the brush part and then pull it down taught curling the end up, to smooth the top, and do that for the rest of the section, then I go back and start over, this time blowing it out parallel to the floor and curling under for volume, then repeat for the rest of the section. I’ve found that this process makes my hair super smooth but with a ton of touchable volume. For the last section at the crown, I brush it forward over my face and work back to front - under, then over - and let it all cool before I finally shake out the most perfect blowout I’ve had. Seriously, it’s better than a salon and takes way less time.  I will say that I usually let my hair air ~80% before styling with the Doubleshot, but I’ve done it freshly towel dried before, it just takes a lot longer, I have to go over each individual piece about 4 times instead of 2. But the Doubleshot is also AWESOME on dry hair!   BUT - it looks beat up after only a year, and I’m not that hard on it. Rubbed off paint, crooked bristles, etc but I still use it every time I wash."

All I wanted was a hair dryer with more heat options so it wouldn’t fry my hair the way other, cheaper dryer brushes do.

Unlike other dryers, this one doesn’t get as hot and and has a smaller barrel. Unfortunately, what that means for my hair is that the frizz remains and the sleek look I created disappears within 20 minutes even though my hair is usually very manageable. I ended up having to go over it again with a curling iron."

PROS: Super lightweight, easy to use, didn't get overly hot (e.g., I could touch my hair immediately after each pass), long rotating cord, it's cute!  CONS: Since I have wavy, frizz-prone hair, it didn't do a great job of getting rid of that halo of frizz I get when I air dry my hair. My hair realistically would take 30-45 minutes of air drying to get dry enough to use this dryer (you can't use it to rough dry), and that's not realistic for getting ready in the morning.  I got this dryer b/c I need to have my own dryer, but if I needed to get rid of frizz I would realistically need to have a separate dryer to rough dry + blow dry downwards to get rid of frizz (yes, I used the dryer on layer in a downward direction (i.e., my hair was beneath the brush)).   tl;dr - not good for frizz elimination and can't rough dry. Wouldn't recommend for thick-ish hair."

They’re made much better then the revlons and grip/grab by thick, curly hair without me fearing it getting stuck. It definitely provides a smooth blow out with a lot of volume but not so much that you look like an extra on set in the 80s. Overall, I think this is worth the 3x price tag compared to the revlon.

The biggest issues are: it blows from all sides so no matter how you're drying your hair, you have extremely hot air blowing straight back onto you making you super sweaty and overheated. It takes much longer to dry all of your hair than a traditional hairdryer. And my hair is still frizzy and requires a straightener afterwards. I'll keep this just because I already threw away the box, but I don't know that it's really worth it."

I also found it to be lighter than the others. The brush is smaller, more round, but that’s what gives me better volume so it’s a plus for me. I was actually disappointed with Amika. It left my hair too straight. Very meh. Hot Tools did a good job but it got waaay too hot and was completely damaging my hair the most so I can’t use it even if I liked it"

It is such a waste of time because I never really get the results I want. My hair is very fine but there's a fair amount of it. The problem is it frizzes very easily. I know it CAN be smoothed out because my stylist can do it. (But he's magical.) Based on reviews and videos, I took a chance on this, knowing I have the option to return if it disappoints. I'm happy to report that it is easy to use, takes about 12-13 minutes from wet to dry, and, best of all, my hair looks like Jennifer Anniston's - not to brag! :). I have not tried anything fancy, just rounding it under, or straight and with a little flip. I get surprisingly good lift on top, and nice bounce. I'm thrilled with the results! Having just turned 60, having my hair look good matters to me more than ever. I just feel better when my hair looks great! Plus, online meetings...ugh. So, if you hate drying your hair because it just doesn't turn out the way you wish it would, or the smoothness gives way to frizz the minute you walk out the door, give this a try."

Pro: Fast - time saving  Easy to handle  Nice power  Cons: Not as smooth as a blow dryer and brush  Less control over the direction of the airflow   Overall might be good for someone that struggles with a professional looking blowout with a brush and blow dryer. My hair is very wavy. This product is blowing the air in multiple directions at once, giving you less control of smoothing the hair in the direction you’re blowing towards, creating flyaway/ frizz. It was much faster than using both a blow dryer and brush, but not sure the time savings is worth the high price with subpar results. I will try two more times before I decide if I’ll keep. I may return it. I recommend this product if you’re not good with blowing out your hair in the traditional way. If you can manage the dryer and brush, I suggest spending your money on something different at Sephora."

I've also experimented with twisting it to curl the hair which worked, but I haven't done a full head of that yet so I'm not sure how it would end up. Pulling the hair upwards with the dryer brush underneath the hair gives nice volume. I normally also brush is down over the top of my hair to eliminate any flyaways and am able to get a frizz-free finished look. I haven't had it long enough to say whether it's damaging to my hair, but I will say I am able to hold my other hand over the hair as I go and it doesn't feel too hot.

However there are some serious issues with its manufacturing that you should know before you purchase. First of all, the product is a little heavy and cumbersome. Also the little yellow bristle coverings fall off as the device gets hot. This has made my brush extremely painful to use at this point as nearly none of the bristles have a protective tip. The item also will make a burning smell as your hair gets wrapped up in it, which if you have long hair like me, will happen a lot. Overall, it works wonderfully at first but has an extremely short lifespan. I wouldn't choose this product compared to other items available."

With extremely long, thick hair, I used to reluctantly wash my hair every other day...and would often push it. The barrier for me was always the drying process; my hair takes forever to dry naturally, but it's a pain to blowdry myself.  This tool has changed everything. I LOVE to wash my hair now, because I know I can get my hair from soaking wet to dry in about 15 minutes - with minimal effort, AND without having to use a hot tool to style after. It's shiny, smooth, and it has actually gotten me to wear my hair bouncy/straight more often now.  My tip: let your hair air dry for 15-30 minutes (or longer) if you can, and the drying time will go down even more. I also liked their tip to use it to refresh your blowout - on day 3, I can run the brush through my hair to give it a revived look."

It works like a charm once I figured out what works for my hair type. There are three different settings: a cool function, low heat and high heat. I made sure to put in a heat protection spray (Thank you, OUAI!) and started off on the high heat setting to get it dry enough to style. I found switching to low heat to get that coveted curl at the end works best, and then finished it off with the cool setting to tame any flyaways. I recommend sealing it with a styling oil of choice afterwards to keep it soft and smooth.   Overall, the process took me about twenty minutes. I highly recommend this for a relatively easy, beautiful blow out!"

			"review_text": "Honestly was hesitant at first to buy this product because of the price tag but in the end it was extremely worth the purchase. First it allows for you to blow dry your hair in a quick and efficient time allowing for a smooth and shiny blowout. Second it’s super easy to travel with as you don’t have to bring a round brush and a blow dryer instead you have one compact item. At first it takes a couple tries to get used to it but once you get used to it it works wonders. I have super thick curly blond hair that took almost an hour and a half with a regular blow dryer but with this product I was able to dry my hair in 45 minutes. My suggestion for using this product is only shampoo your hair as the product buildup from conditioner can cause the blow dryer not to work as well and use a blow dryer oil such as the dry bar or drugstore ones are a great alternative! Overall love this product and dry bar never disappoints!"

I had to use my Conair round rotating brush to try and salvage the style.    It's also really loud and got pretty hot. (I had to put in earplugs while using!)

To have them both in one hand held tool is a wonderful concept! The first several uses produced great results! However after the 3rd use I noticed that the bristles started to frey and the cold setting no longer worked. This resulted in having to work my hair more and adding smoothing serum to the routine to obtain the sleek blow out look that I had previously obtained during the first 2 uses! I have yet to contact Sephora or Dry bar about these issues. Hopefully something can be done about it. The item itself is a good weight and not too heavy. I like that the setting knobs are at the bottom of the unit and out of the way to hinder accidental setting changes. The knob of top of the unit and rotating power chord are also very useful during manipulation of the unit. So you can use the unit without burning your hand and the chord getting in the way. However due to the bristles degrading so fast and the cold setting not working, it leaves me wondering if the unit will actually last to really get my money's worth..."

It's easy to use, but is it that much easier than using a blow dryer and a round brush, which also 100% give a better result? I've been wanting to try the Revlon but I've been burned (literally) by cheap hot hair tools in the past and thought I should try this high end (judging by the price) version. But having used it I'm not sure what makes it high end. It was hard to perceive whether this is really a better implement; it's not cheap feeling, necessarily, but it's not made of nicer materials, didn't make me feel it was better (less damaging) for my hair, and had at least one significant design flaw -- it's a pain to switch on and off (you twist the bottom to the on position; if you're trying to use the cool shot function, good luck not overshooting.) I did my hair twice with it, and once it turned out great, and the other it turned out pretty flat and frizzy. I'm not really sure what the difference was --maybe starting with different level of hair moisture? I think I'm going to try the Revlon after all, it's so much cheaper and will probably be useful in a pinch; it's undeniably easier to use one implement than two (i.e. hair dryer and round brush). I just didn't feel this offered anything extra to me, but maybe it could be useful to someone who absolutely can't use a roundbrush and blow dryer at the same time."

I’ve tried doing it with a round brush and blow dryer with less than stellar results—it takes a long time, my hair ends up enormous and then I have to use a flat iron anyway. With the Double Shot I can run it through my hair and in about 10 minutes it’s relatively dry and it’s smooth.  I’ve posted two pics: one of my sad efforts with a brush and blow dryer, one where I used the Double Shot for the first time. It took about 10 to 15 minutes with no particular technique, I just kind of ran it through my hair, some big sections, some small. I know I would get even better results if I had more patience, but for me, this was well worth it. Also—it holds up. A really good salon blowout will last me four to five days; the Double Shot I can make last three to four days."

I think it’s a good buy for the occasional party but not a daily use for me.  I have thick wavy hair that blow dries beautifully if you give it the time.  I would say let your hair dry a bit before you use this. Takes too long to dry with this alone right out of the shower.  However, it does a good job if you have the time."

I also have discovered that it’s best to do a rough dry of the root area, since the brush can’t really reach that close to the scalp. I used it for the first time today and was very pleased with the result. No frizz, lots of volume and nice shape. Just cutting down on frizz is worth the extra bit of time it takes to dry my hair with this dryer. If you’re on the fence and don’t mind a bit of trial and error, you should go ahead and buy this product."

Now that my hair doesn’t air dry by the time I get to work, I realized I needed to do something about it. Aiming the hair dryer at my head and fluffing my hair around with my fingers like I used to do ended poorly. At my last trim, I asked the stylist to show me how to blow dry my hair and bought the round brush she recommended.  A) if you don’t do it perfectly, that round brush tangles so badly in your hair that your husband has to put body lotion on it and extract your hair piece by piece; B) how the heck are you supposed to manage a hair dryer in one hand and a very dangerous round brush in the other, in the mirror—backwards?!  Haven’t touched the round brush since and go to work with my hair in a bun now.   Just received this Blow-Dryer Brush yesterday and used it for the first time. Game. Changer. The bristles are far enough apart that it doesn’t tangle my hair, and completely eliminates the dual-wielding problem. It took about 15 minutes for me to do my whole head. It’s hard to get the very top layer of hair (apparently I need salon clips? I’ll work up to it) but absolutely no complaints. If you suck at hair, this is for you."

It always somehow falls flat too so getting volume in the area my hair is thinning is difficult. This tool is phenomenal. I used it on semi-wet hair that I had added some nourishing oil in and a heat protector and I was able to dry it in 15 minutes! Having the ability to grab my hair from the root and blow dry upwards gave me SO much more volume. This blow dryer smoothed my hair and gave it more body. For once, I didn’t have the wiry, flat hair I normally do. It feels great to get a little confidence back since my scalp doesn’t show as often due to the volume this gave me. Thank you Drybar."

The hair stylist at the salon I go to recommend that I buy a round brush blow dryer from Amazon. I went for the cheapest knock off and the first time I used it I was relatively happy. The second time it started sparking and I could smell burnt plastic so I sent it back and then spent the extra dollars on the Revlon one. I was much happier with the Revlon one, I saw better results then from the knock off and I was content that this one didn't try and set fire to my bathroom. Then Sephora came out with Drybar's version. I didn't need it, I  was content with the Revlon one and the Drybar was a lot more expensive but I just couldn't stop thinking about trying it. I spent more time then I would like to admit on contemplating buying the Drybar, but ultimately I decided to take the plunge and try it since Sephora has a great return policy. Bought it, tried it and fell instantly in love with it! I find this Drybar version easier for me to handle over the Revlon one by far. I am also able to shape my ends which I wasn't able to do with the Revlon, and it dries my hair much faster and way smoother. The quality of the Drybar in looks, feel, and overall drying smoothing volume and shaping far outrank Revlon to me. To give perspective I have long wavy highlighted hair past my mid back, that is layered all over but mostly in the front and I can get my whole head blow dryed in about 10 minutes from towel dryed, and it actually looks like I could have come from a salon. I really recommend this brush blow dryer in one tool for sure if you have long hair, I am not sure how well it works on short hair as the brush itself is quite large."

Like many others, I had my heart set on the Dyson Airwrap but couldn't make peace with the price tag, so I went with this instead. My hair is long and thick and I could never get the hang of a blow out with a dryer and brush that came out the way I wanted. I've gotten close but it's too much work.  I'm a realist, so I wasn't expecting a miracle. I knew I would to have to use a blow dryer or air dry some first because of my hair type. As long as you're okay with that this is a great product. It's efficient and fool proof - I don't think it's possible to mess up. Takes some practice for specific styling but it's easy to pick up. I prefer to let my hair air dry and I use this when damp and I'm done in less than 15 minutes. This thing is comically huge in real life, but it's perfect for my long hair. Not sure it would work for very short hair. I normally always have bristle issues - it's been a month of use every other day and no problem yet."

Idk why people are saying it’s heavy, I think it’s way lighter than a regular blow dryer. It is pretty loud on the high setting but that’s understandable considering the brush has air holes so the sound has to go out somewhere. I love this brush it makes it so much easier and I know it’s a good quality product and will last a long time! Well worth the money to me. If even blows out my hair when it’s already dried and has kinks in it, smooths it out and gives it volume. That’s amazing!"

I wasn’t so sure about the whole dryer brush thing and thought that there was no way that I could get a good blow dry with this type of product. I was very used to my Chi blow dryer and my Sephora round brush. But I could never get a great blowout and always had to use a flat iron or a large barrel curling iron to finish my style. I didn’t wanna dish out 150 bucks on something that I wasn’t sure about, so I found one at a discount store that was only $30 but was a Generic type brand.  I tried it out and fell in love with the product. It eliminates the need for the follow up flat iron ore curling iron and cuts down on the amount of time it takes to dry. Plus it’s so much easier than having to hold The blow dryer with one hand and spin the round brush with the other.  I bought this product because I was so impressed with the cheapie that I thought that I would get tremendous results. Well this product does work well. I did not see that big a difference in the $30 item versus $150 item. Both give me about the same result. Overall I would say that dryer brushes are awesome. But I only gave this 3 stars because of the price. You can get a good result with something far cheaper."

So I returned it. Definitely do not waste your money on this. I would go 1 of 2 ways if you're looking for a good product: get the revlon which is substantially less expensive and most definitely better bang for your buck; or invest in the Dyson airwrap. I originally purchased this thinking it would be a good compromise between the 2 (Dyson and Revlon). But honestly, after trying this, I went ahead and got the Dyson and it is worth every penny. The quality is THERE. And if you think about it, you get 8 attachments, which comes out to be a good deal if you ask me. $550 for 8 attachments and a truly unique, high tech, high quality product, or $150 for this Revlon-rip off piece of junk. The dyson will replace most all of your other hair products and is a major win over this think."

As a new student in cosmetology school, I will be buying a second one to use on my clients."

Especially with short hair, this thing is super easy to use, but a word of caution, it is ENORMOUS. I hope they come out with a mini or travel size like they have of the straightening brush both because it would be more manageable and because the barrel size would be easier to achieve waves for shorter hair. I can’t really achieve waves with this brush, but I do get that amazing polished blowout bob. Glad I took the plunge and spent the money!"

The first thing I noticed was how much lighter it was than the Revlon. I travel a good deal for work and it has made bringing this with me much easier—I would often leave the Revlon one at home because it weighed more. In addition, the Drybar version dries my thick shoulder length hair much faster and leaves it looking fuller. While both products are very similar, if you prefer a lighter version that seems to dry faster while leaving your hair looking fuller and more “blown out”, I think this one is for you."

So then I would have to use a flat iron, and the whole process would take me 35 min. And if I wanted any curl in my hair at the ends, I'd then have a curling iron that I'd sometimes used to get it right. This blow-dryer is nothing but magic. I can now start with a head of hair straight from the shower and end up looking like my hair was professionally blown out in 25 minutes. 1 step. And, the next morning I'll use it to re-fresh my hair (only spend 5 minutes) to get the sleep kinks out and it looks even more fabulous. No frizz! No flat iron needed! This blow dryer has finally made straight hair easy for me. I use bumble and bumble all style blow dry and finish with bumble and bumble soft texture finishing spray. I think I sold 4 the first time I used this at the gym. I have no idea how it will hold up with time, but so far it is nothing short of perfection. Not too heavy, love the part on top so I can hold with both hands, and the cool setting is perfect to cool yourself off when done."

I bought this because I’m tired of holding a dryer and brush. Simplicity.  There are three temps hot, med and cold. The hot toasts ears so be careful. I’m using the med and it does take just as long as a dryer. Not keen on using the hot as my hair is fine and color treated. I am using a heat product but I’m doubting that can completely stop damage on high heat. The cold does work, it just takes the brush a few min to change temps.   Gives great body to hair but it took me awhile to figure out how to get body at top of my head. Think rollers. Same principle applies with the brush. My hair is smooth it does look like a blow out. I just wish Sephora would give a 60 day trial. I blow my hair out once a week so I’ve only used it 3 times and 30 days is almost up."

I normally section my hair to make the blow drying easier and can get smooth, frizz free hair in about 15 minutes and be out the door. This brush works so well that I don't have to go back in with a flat iron to smooth anything out after I'm done blow drying.

I generally hate blow drying my hair because I’m not coordinated with a brush and dryer, my hair ends up frizzy and I get super hot while blow drying my hair! If that sounds like you then consider trying this brush instead. My hair is not thick nor thin, naturally straight and there by naturally FLAT. It’s collarbone in length and fairly fine. I never would shower before work because blow drying + using some heated tool was always too much. Now I shower all the time before work. This brush dries and smooths hair all while creating volume at the root. The volume part is the big winner for me since my hair is naturally so flat. After using this I don’t need to apply any other hot tool, I can just leave the house as is! Would totally recommend this as a time saver and at home blow out. I’m not sure how it compares to cheaper brands, but I can definitely say I would send money on this one."

To be really, really honest, they both perform exactly the same.  The Drybar is maybe a tiny amount quieter, and the barrel doesn't get quite as hot. Also I have a hard time spinning the barrel on the Drybar one.  It doesn't turn as easily as the Revlon one.  But, all of that is water under the bridge because STATIC.  Sure, I could douse my hair in silicone but I don't want to do that. I have never needed to before.  I literally changed nothing else about my routine except from the Revlon dryer to this one and my hair is plastered to my head with static.

			"review_text": "This is amazing! It really does speed up your blowdrying process. I wouldn’t recommend this with dripping wet hair, but I never blowdry my hair when it is dripping wet anyway. What I do is put it in a hair turban for about 30 mins and then use this wonderful device and 5 mins later I’m DONE. I have long hair (just above my buttocks). Normally, with a normal blowdryer, like for example the Buttercup   round brush   layers, it takes me about 20  minutes to dry my hair from the same state (30 mins in hair turban). No need to layer, can do bigger streaks at a time, this is perfect. It’s a bit noisier than the Buttercup, but not by much. The only thing I wish was that there would be a “cold shot” button kind of like on standard blowdryers but the only way is to use your other hand and reach for the cool option and then go back to the warm. And only 2 warm settings. And there are less options than standard blowdryers. But this is definitely great for those of us who don’t always have time to style our hair and just need to dry it. The handle is a bit on the big side, but really a great purchase overall. Definitely worth it."

I have used it twice since it arrived and my hair looks silly smooth, full of boucey curled ends and volume. I have a head full of long, dark and layered hair, so I thought this would take forever to dry. I used while wet, and dried in smaller sections. I was done in approx 15-20 mins Max. I normally take 30 mins with a standard dryer and round brush, then run a curler through it too for nice ends. This cut that down to our one tool. again, I'm please and this was a good buy. One thing to note,the barrel is pretty large, so of you have weak wrists or smaller hands, it does make a bit more challenging to hold."

This gets very hot on high, hotter than the Revlon version, so use a heat protector. My medium length fine hair can be dried in 10 mins. Occasionally I will need a couple passes from a flatiron for frizz and flyaways. Works well for drying, volume, and minimal straightening. Can get a slight curl at the end, but nothing dramatic. Is it nice? Yes. Is it necessary? No. Is it 4-5x better than the Revlon as the price would suggest? Debatable. This does have a better warranty I think but still...it is a LOT pricier for a non-essential tool. See if you can try this at a Drybar or dept. store before committing. I wish Sephora had floor models of their tools since buying and returning isn’t the best method."

As an avid hair dryer and total idiot when it comes to using a round brush I was excited to finally pull the trigger and buy this. My first one was a lemon and burnt out after a few minutes of use. The second one is fantastic, BUT the soft bristles are definitely bending and it definitely does not cut the drying time in half. With my normal blow dryer it would take me 8-10min and with this it was a solid 13-18min. I also feel like for the future, they need to redesign to get better coverage to get the roots since they're hard to dry right now, but overall this was a good buy and I'm totally in love!"

I was on the fence about this tool because I love my Dyson styler, but now that I have it, I am glad I bought it i have fine straight hair, shoulder length for now, and this tool makes my hair so shiny, smooth, and with tons of volume at the root and everywhere. My hair is super bouncy after using it, and it lasts. I also love the Dyson styler for the innovative curling heads, and the straight brushes are also awesome, but gives a more natural blowout, which is also nice. But the Drybar one gives a toooon of volume and the style is more polished. My hair dried in no time, and I found the tool easy to use. This is awesome. I am super challenged with styling my hair with just a brush and dryer, so having all these tools help me stay polished and well put together. I love both the Dyson styler and this Drybar brush, with slightly liking this Drybar more than the Dyson straight/smooth head brushes :-) I love the Dyson more for easy, damage-free curling (versus a hot iron). I hope this helps!"

That said, I do think that the double shot did a pretty good job blowing my hair out straighter than it would if it air dried. It also simplified the process because I didn’t have to hold a brush in one hand and a blow dryer in the other. I also noticed that this doesn’t get THAT hot - the buttercup gets way hotter. I’m not saying that’s necessarily a bad thing because it would probably be difficult to handle if it got really hot.   A few cons: I am concerned about the longevity of the boar bristles that enable you to get some tension while blow drying. After the first use they do seem a bit frazzled so I’m not sure what the shelf life of this will be. If those bristles become super tangled you’ll pretty much have to toss it. Second, and perhaps not that big of a deal, I find this thing to be borderline deafening in my ear when I dry sections in front of my face.   Overall, I like it and would recommend trying it out, but I don’t think it achieves the same results as a traditional blowout with a round brush."

This one takes a few minutes longer to dry than the Revlon, mainly because it doesn’t get as hot (which to me is a good thing). It is also lighter in weight and gives an unbelievable bounce/volume. Overall I am quite happy with it. Reasons why I’m giving it 4 and not 5 stars is: #1 - at $150, price is a bit steep, if this would be close to $100, I would think it’s a great value. #2 - I still think the hair looks healthier when you blow dry with a traditional blow dryer!"

I like this brush better, it gets less hot than the Revlon brush, which left my hair feeling less damaged. It still worked quickly and I was left with a nice blowout. I used the hottest setting for the bottom layers of my hair and used the lower heat setting for my top layers (that have more damage and baby hairs) and my hair was left shiny and bouncy."

From soaking wet hair to dry and styled in 15 minutes?? Where has this been my whole life. I’m hooked and it’s seriously the only tool I need when I travel. You get a gorgeous blow out look in minutes."

			"review_text": "Everyone wants to know how this compares to another popular brand with a similar hairdryer at a third of the cost. I notice two major differences which, for me, warrant the additional expense. (1) This doesn’t get as hot on the low setting, so it doesn’t scorch my fine hair and it leaves it really smooth. (2) The barrel is slightly smaller, so it curls my ends a bit as opposed to just making them flip out 70s style. I subtracted one star for the noise and the fact that the cool setting isn’t a button but I otherwise recommend this one over other popular brands if it’s within your budget."

A blowout that usually takes a 45 minutes was reduced to 15 with this tool and Drybar's quick-dry serum. My biggest concern was my curly roots, which got blown out a bit, but I still had to run over them with a straightening iron. That was to be expected, since my roots are stubbornly curly.  For my curly girls, I highly recommend this dryer! It surprised me, someone who ordered this with extreme skepticism. I love it!"

I struggle with my hair being thick, frizzy and curly but this took smoothes and tames my hair and makes me look like I just came from the salon. It does take a little bit of practice but once you have it down you won’t be able to go without it. I highly recommend watching the videos- they definitely help you figure out techniques and tricks. Overall this is a high quality and effective tool and one I’m hooked on."

So it's super nice being able to use 1 tool. Honestly, I grew up using my mom's version of this brush that never got hot enough which took forever to blowdry. I love how hot this tool gets. And I'm serious when I say that it gets hot, so be careful! What else I also like is that the barrel isn't as wide as some of the other ones that are out there. I mean, it's definitely not a narrow barrel but it's definitely is easier to use on my shorter hair. It's actually pretty comfortable on my hands too. I'm pretty much very happy with this new addition to my hair tools collection. :)"

The two types of bristles grip my hair well so I don't have to hold the ends, and it leaves my hair extremely smooth, soft, and shiny. Plus, it easily straightened the curls at my roots and even the shorter pieces of hair. It gave me a decent amount of body (though my second-day hair was very flat), too. It's LOUD, but I got used to it pretty quickly."

I’ve used this twice now and it honestly has me cancelling all of my blow out appointments. Both times I’ve used it I have been able to maintain the results for 4 days before having to wash and restyle. Took a couple tries to get down the  technique for the right volume at the crown and ends but seriously so SO pleased with the results."

It dries my hair (I have a lot of it) in 15 minutes and it doesn’t weigh. That’s just one thing I did t like about the Revlon one, with the weight of the brush and the weight of my hair my arms and wrists would hurt 10 minutes in. This brush stands out. My arms didn’t hurt, my hair dried straight and it didn’t feel like my hair itself was fried. The Revlon brush made my hair feel fried, it dried it out and it smelled like it was frying my hair in the process. The Double Shot blow dry brush left my hair smooth and soft. I truly love this brush."

For the price I should have soft bristles that will last a lot longer. The hard bristles are fine it’s just the soft one. I guess from the tension but I hope they aren’t flat after month."
