I feel like it makes all my subsequent products in my routine soak in better and my skin feels plumper and smoother.  Highly recommend for anyone that likes to use a toner and/or that is into mild lotions.  I don't know why they call it a lotion, as it really is just a clear liquid like a toner.  There isn't really much scent. It feels really good on my skin and I highly recommend."

It's expensive but the bottle lasts such a long time and a little goes a long way, it feels great on cracked dry hands in cold weather too. Calling it a lotion isn't quite right, the consistency is more like water but it feels amazing to put on right after a shower in the morning or before bed. At one point they stopped carrying it at sephora and I was heartbroken trying to find more but so glad it's back! All I use on my face is a gentle cleanser followed by this and a little skin protectant and my sensitive skin LOVES it"

I wasn't sure how to use it, or if I should use it... After pouring a bit into my hand, rather than putting it on my face, I rubbed it into my hands. My hands stayed soft and moisturized through several hand washes. I've used hand 'treatment' moisturizers for years. Sometimes they were products meant for the hands, and other times I used a face moisturizer that wasn't working for my face. Here's the thing: first, I am in my late 60s, and although my hands have aged, I don't have a single age spot on them. I started using good products on my hands when I had half a dozen spots on them. The spots went away and I've never had a spot since. Second, I definitely should have added that using this on my hands takes the tiniest bit, less than an 8th of a teaspoon."

It is recommended to use on a cotton round but I put it on with my hands and pat in until it soaks all the way in. The smell is light, the consistency is like water & it leaves my skin somewhat luminous and hydrated. I follow up with my fave moisturizer and I’m good to go. The itchy and burning bumps are gone and I am left with a bit of scarring and some flaking but overall my skin is MUCH calmer and smoother after using this. I recommend this product to all my sensitive skin girls. Before is from 10/21 & after is from 10/24."

			"review_text": "For reference, my skin: fair, combo/oily, adult acne, some rosacea  I received a sample of this in a gift bag, so really had no expectations for it, but turns out I absolutely love it. It's very watery, more of a toner than a lotion - I use it nightly under any serums (usually vitamin C or a retinol) and a night cream. It provides the perfect boost of moisture if your skin is naturally dry or simply irritated. I found it help calm my summer blotchiness/rosacea without breaking me out at all. It also seems to cut the burn/irritation of any harsher products applied on top. I'd say it's slightly less hydrating than a pure hyaluronic acid serum, but much more calming, which is exactly what my skin type needs. It lasts quite a while, too. I put maybe a dime size squirt in my palms and rub it on my face that way and, with once daily use, the sample bottle I've had for months isn't even halfway gone.   Overall, if you want a gentle serum/toner to use under (or after) harsher products, or if you just need a boost of calming moisture, I'd highly recommend trying this.   Just for comparison, I'd say the closest thing to this I've tried has been Glow Recipe's Avocado Ceramide Serum (different ingredients, but same claims of redness relief and moisture) and I found this one more moisturizing and MUCH more calming (and more wallet-friendly!)."

Right out of the tall, recyclable bottle, is a  watery texture I apply directly to my clean hands and apply it to my freshly cleansed face. This toner lotion (more like liquid) absorbs quickly and does a fabulous job at hydrating and plumping my oily/combination skin. I have noticed a significant difference in my pores and uneven texture. With consistent use my skin now appears brighter, more even skin tone, while reducing redness almost immediately. I also struggle with clogged pores in my t-zone & I've experienced no issues while using this. It takes away excess oil, without drying me out. I highly recommend giving this product a try!"

			"review_text": "Really didn’t like this product. The actual content of mushroom extract is very low, it’s mostly just essential oils which didn’t help my skin. Left my skin with some breakouts and just wasn’t the hydrating toner it’s advertised itself to be. I guess the only benefit it did provide was smoothen some texture around my nose. Currently using it on my neck and décolletage to finish up the product, and haven’t experienced any issues but just doesn’t seem worth it honestly."

This lotion feels more like a toner or watery serum, but I really enjoy the texture of it. The formula makes it penetrate into my skin easily, and every time I have used it, I have noticed less redness and skin irritation overall. Using this in the morning as my first step also creates a great base for my makeup and I've noticed a difference with how it wears. I highly recommend this product."

I would’ve loved an actual cream lotion but it works so that’s okay. I also used this on rougher areas of my body and it got smoother than before pretty quickly. I definitely recommend for dry skin or redness"

I haven’t noticed a difference at all between using it and not using it. It hasn’t changed my skins texture or improve any of the imperfections over the course of my 3 week usage. I haven’t noticed any downsides however. A lot of products cause me to breakout, and this product hasn’t. I wouldn’t recommend it, try another toner."

It has a nice subtle smell. The packaging and ingredients are all made from healthy materials. The only thing I would change is that the formula itself is super thin liquid, I wish it was a thicker gel or cream. Other than that I love it and will continue to use it."
