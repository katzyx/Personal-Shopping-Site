I feel like it makes all my subsequent products in my routine soak in better and my skin feels plumper and smoother.  Highly recommend for anyone that likes to use a toner and/or that is into mild lotions.  I don't know why they call it a lotion, as it really is just a clear liquid like a toner.  There isn't really much scent. It feels really good on my skin and I highly recommend."

My hands stayed soft and moisturized through several hand washes. I've used hand 'treatment' moisturizers for years. Sometimes they were products meant for the hands, and other times I used a face moisturizer that wasn't working for my face. Here's the thing: first, I am in my late 60s, and although my hands have aged, I don't have a single age spot on them. I started using good products on my hands when I had half a dozen spots on them. The spots went away and I've never had a spot since. Second, I definitely should have added that using this on my hands takes the tiniest bit, less than an 8th of a teaspoon."

I used this for 3 days and it helped my skin so much. It is recommended to use on a cotton round but I put it on with my hands and pat in until it soaks all the way in. The smell is light, the consistency is like water & it leaves my skin somewhat luminous and hydrated. I follow up with my fave moisturizer and Iu2019m good to go. The itchy and burning bumps are gone and I am left with a bit of scarring and some flaking but overall my skin is MUCH calmer and smoother after using this. I recommend this product to all my sensitive skin girls. Before is from 10/21 & after is from 10/24."

            "review_text": "For reference, my skin: fair, combo/oily, adult acne, some rosacea  I received a sample of this in a gift bag, so really had no expectations for it, but turns out I absolutely love it. It's very watery, more of a toner than a lotion - I use it nightly under any serums (usually vitamin C or a retinol) and a night cream. It provides the perfect boost of moisture if your skin is naturally dry or simply irritated. I found it help calm my summer blotchiness/rosacea without breaking me out at all. It also seems to cut the burn/irritation of any harsher products applied on top. I'd say it's slightly less hydrating than a pure hyaluronic acid serum, but much more calming, which is exactly what my skin type needs. It lasts quite a while, too. I put maybe a dime size squirt in my palms and rub it on my face that way and, with once daily use, the sample bottle I've had for months isn't even halfway gone.   Overall, if you want a gentle serum/toner to use under (or after) harsher products, or if you just need a boost of calming moisture, I'd highly recommend trying this.   Just for comparison, I'd say the closest thing to this I've tried has been Glow Recipe's Avocado Ceramide Serum (different ingredients, but same claims of redness relief and moisture) and I found this one more moisturizing and MUCH more calming (and more wallet-friendly!)."
