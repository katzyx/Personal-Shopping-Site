Since I am a busy student, I love having an easy and elegant eye look, which is made simple using this eyeshadow duo. Each version has complimentary shades, so you can create a more layered and complex look or just have a simple single shimmery shade. I love to use a single shade as it always looks effortless, yet still extremely elevated. The luxurious packaging is very sleek and elegant. Most importantly, it is very secure, so I don't have to worry about the eyeshadow breaking. Overall, I highly recommend this product as I prefer a versatile and smaller selection of shades compared to large and bulky palettes. This review was collected as part of a promotion."

I have also worn it for New Year‚Äôs Day with gems by my eyes for that extra glam look. I use my fingers to apply it as I find that way gives the most color payoff and less fallout. It lasted well over 8 hours during a holiday shift. If you haven‚Äôt tried it, I would highly recommend testing it out in stores."

			"review_text": "I picked up Still At the Club and We Need Better Lighting.   Still At The Club: These formulas remind me a lot of PML special shades. the top is comparable to the astral formula, with slightly finer glitter and a bit more of a base. It's beautiful. The bottom is comparable to the blitz formula. It's super smooth and highly pigmented, and falls between a satin and a shimmer. I absolutely love this duo and would give it 5 stars.   We Need Better Lighting: Both of these are toppers. The glitters are more substantial than those in the UD Moondust formula. They look really beautiful on the eye, BUT, I much prefer both formulas in the SATC duo. It's still really pretty, and I'd give it 3.5 stars, just because of the comparison.   I wish it was more apparent that this collection includes multiple formulas. They could have done a much better job marketing, and I think people would have been happier if they knew what exactly they were getting before ordering."

			"review_text": "This is a beautiful mini palette. The price is not so beautiful... The ONLY reason I bought  this is because I had $10 in points to use, making it cheaper than the Urban Decay Moon Dust singles. While this color combo is stunning on my skin tone, and I can apply them with my fingers and literally be done, is it really worth $42 (I paid $32 + tax with my points)? I found the Moira Chroma Light Shadow in How Charming to be comparable and only $7. I still have to give this 4 out of 5 stars for texture, ease of use, color saturation, and packaging. It does wear well with the Clinique eyeshadow primer (the little green compact) and lasted all day (over 8 hours). If you're a Patrick Ta super fan, or you just can't live without one or all of the shades, then treat yourself. But please, don't feel pressure or compelled by YouTube influencers or even reviews. Buy it because you love the color(s), and you're going to wear it. Then it's worth it. If $42 is gonna wreck you, check out Moira. The formula really is high-end, and the colors are STUNNING."

I had to go back in several times to get any sort of pigment to show which means you‚Äôll be using a lot of product every time you use it. It photographs very well but in person, the sparkles and the shimmer do not have the same payoff. In the photos I added, I added a glitter glue primer under the swatches. Talk to My Team are the two swatches on the right and Do You Know Who I Am are the two swatches to the left of it. On the very left, I swatched an indie brand‚Äôs $12 duo-chrome shade (Ambitious from Adriana Nichole Cosmetics) for comparison and as you can see, it has way better pigment and payoff. I also only had to swatch it once to get that amount of pigment to show. It‚Äôs incredibly buttery as well and gives a wet look like Patrick Ta‚Äôs duos were advertised to do but didn‚Äôt. That indie brand has a whole 12-pan palette for $45. I don‚Äôt really think of Patrick Ta as a luxury brand either and these were definitely not worth $42.

I think a lot of people are justifiably angry over rising prices and the recent occurrance of Patrick Ta's other eyeshadows growing mold.  However, I decided to take a chance on these particular eyeshadows because I get eyelid irritation easily from other eyeshadows (probably from ingredients such as talc, bismuth oxychloride, and benzoic acid), and I noticed this particular formula didn't have any of the ingredients I believe I'm reacting to.  I'm happy to report that I had no irritation from this formula.  The lighter shade in Talk to My Team reminds me of Frog from Colourpop.  There was minimal fallout from this duo as well as the duo Still at the Club.  However, the duo We Need Better Lighting had a lot of fallout.  Overall, I am satisfied, but if you can use other eyeshadow formulas just fine, then you definitely don't need to spend more money on something that is easily dupable in colors and sparkle effect by cheaper companies."

You can use a brush, an applicator and even your fingers for application. The combination of tones are incredible.

The deeper shade applied sheerer than expected. When compared to ColourPop‚Äôs Quite Storm from the Lush for Dusk palette, Quite Storm has a more noticeable copper base. Both shades lasted well without primer, but the intense sparkle felt a bit overwhelming for my usual natural makeup. I also felt a slight sting in my eyes a few times during my first try, which has never happened with ColourPop shadows. I didn‚Äôt feel satisfied with the $42 price tag for this product.

For the glittery top shade, I swatched it on the right side and compared it to a swatch I created on the left side using Delilah from the I Need a Nude palette and Fenty Beauty‚Äôs Diamond Bomb. The two swatches are nearly identical, with Delilah providing a similar base and the Diamond Bomb adding comparable shimmer.

I have yet to try any of the other shades in this range, but will keep my eyes open for the future.   If you wanted the pigment density in the photos you would have to layer quite a bit.

These eyeshadows are perfect for anyone who loves a touch of sparkle without going over the top. The formula is incredible‚Äîeach duo contains a stunning combination of shades that illuminate the eyes with superfine sparkle and a multidimensional pearl pigment that catches the light beautifully.  The shimmer is incredibly refined, giving your eyelids a soft, sophisticated glow, rather than the chunky glitter you sometimes get with other eyeshadows. The matte shade in each duo provides just the right amount of contrast, and both textures blend seamlessly.  What I really love about these duos is how effortlessly they enhance the eyes. Whether I‚Äôm going for a subtle, everyday look or something more dramatic, the combination of the shimmering pearl pigments and the smooth, matte shades always delivers a multidimensional, flattering finish. The colors last all day without fading or creasing, which is a big win for me.  If you want eyeshadows that make your eyes pop with luminous, radiant sparkle, I highly recommend the Major Dimension Eye Illusion Eyeshadow Duos. The quality is top-notch, and the effect is simply beautiful!"

The price isn't the problem, but the quality of texture and fact that you are getting very similar shades across the board are. Also, worth mentioning, that my friend had a terrible experience with Patrick Ta's customer service team.... pretty unbelievable they couldn't help her out, especially with PT being a luxury brand.. that's a review I will let my friend expand on... but just beware that they are NOT helpful if you need any assistance after an order is placed and you are SOL.

I tried it without any other eyeshadow on to see how it felt and would stay on my skin. The two colors in the palette I have are not too dissimilar from one another, so they went together nicely. I found I had to apply with my finger because my brushes couldn‚Äôt pick up the powder well, which wasn‚Äôt a big deal, just something I noticed.  I do have sensitive skin, so the first day I wore the eyeshadow, it began to irritate my skin after a couple hours, but if applied on top of another eyeshadow, it‚Äôs not as bad.  This is a translucent shimmer, which is perfect for the inner corner of your eyes.  And it is glitter, sometimes it spread past the eyes as my day progressed haha.  All in all it is very pretty and sparkly. If you love an added shimmer to your look, this is for you."

This eyeshadow is great for any occasion, and you can do a simple look that is more scattered or you can build it up for a really pigmented sparkle. This eyeshadow does drag on your skin if you‚Äôre on the drier side and can be a bit streaky, but if you use a primer or build up slowly it goes on much more smoothly. There is some fallout as well, which I think is expected from shimmery shades like this. I do wish the pigment and sparkles lasted a bit longer throughout the day. The packaging was a little confusing to open at first, but I adore the rose gold color and built in mirror, although the outside smudges/gets fingerprints easily. It‚Äôs also perfectly sized to throw in your purse and take on-the-go."

			"review_text": "Opening this stunning eyeshadow duo was an emotional experience and I couldn't wait to get it on my face! I have only tried one other product from Patrick Ta and his packaging is so glamorous, so enticing. The issue is that the eyeshadow inside doesn't match the quality of the case it comes in. It's not that I don't find it absolutely beautiful, I do, but it's difficult to apply and irritates my eyes.   When I first opened the duo Do You Know Who I Am? I was in awe and had to swatch each shade. My fingertips were coated in two distinct colors, but when I transferred each one to the back of my hand, I was a little let down at how the sparkle was all I saw and that they looked identical. Okay, sometimes it takes a bit of layering. That worked OKAY.  When the time came to test them on my face, I decided to go for a soft eyeshadow brush that I would normally choose for glitter shadows. That was a mistake because it just didn't pick up. When I got enough to apply to my eyelids, more got on my cheeks than my eye area. I decided to start over with eye primer and a powder barrier on my cheeks. That helped, but I had to switch out my brush to a firmer one. This just wasn't going well and I could see the primer so much that I instead chose a liquid eyeshadow and to use the Patrick Ta shadows as topper. At this point, I gave up and left it subpar for the day.  The most success I've had with this duo is to apply with my fingers over a liquid eyeshadow. I can't seem to make it work to my standards otherwise and I am an experienced make-up lover. I went to cosmetology AND esthetician school and have been obsessed with makeup for over 25 years! It shouldn't be so difficult with such a prestigious brand!   The worst part? All day long while wearing these eyeshadows, I have gritty particles in my eyes. Irritation from makeup makes me not want to wear it. As lovely as this product looks, it's not my friend and I cannot in good conscience recommend it to anyone after my experience."

The packaging is luxurious and very similar to the components used for the blush and bronzer duos. However, it is really easy to smudge the outer packaging with your fingers. As for the eyeshadows themselves, they are absolutely gorgeous and give a lot of sparkle and shimmer to the eye. The formula is more on the dry side and the glitters are also hard to get off with the skin with just regular micellar water. I would say the shade on top is a rose gold, while the shade on the bottom is more of a bronze gold. Unfortunately for me, I have pigmented eyelids and honestly both shades look the same on them. There was also some fallout when I applied these to my lids. For the duo I received, I also noticed that it took more effort to pick up the pigment from the bottom pan. Overall, I agree that this is a very expensive eyeshadow duo for $42, but the quality is good. I would recommend this people who love shimmery eyes for a night out. In addition, if you have brown eyelids like me, I would opt for a different color duo if you want two distinct shades on your lids."

I‚Äôve worn it for long hours, and  stayed put without creasing or fading. This is huge for me, especially since I have slightly oily eyelids and many other eyeshadows tend to smudge or disappear by midday. With this duo, my eye makeup looks fresh, even after a full day of meetings or running errands. The luxurious packaging, rich pigmentation, smooth application, and long-lasting wear all contribute to making this product a must-have. It‚Äôs not just another eyeshadow duo."

The payoff is amazing, and I had no fallout, even without eyeshadow primer! Blends easily and is compact enough to carry in your purse. I can not stress enough how stunning these shades are.

The sparkles were great but I would have liked them to be a bit more concentrated. The product stays on nicely without creasing when paired with your favorite eye shadow primer. The price is a little steep for 2 shadows, since it‚Äôs around the cost of whole pallette, but since this can be incorporated into my daily look I know I will go through both colors.

What seemed like a textural disaster turned into a buttery, smooth finish, gliding on with full-on shimmer that danced in the light. I wore it on a sunny day, and every reflection felt like a little bit of magic. Applied with fingers, it gleamed unapologetically, while a brush created a soft, romantic glow.  A quick tip: use a good primer to handle the slight fallout. Despite its glitter, the formula felt lightweight and blended effortlessly. The duo‚Äôs versatility lets you choose between subtlety and sparkle, and despite my sensory concerns, it was a delight to wear. If you adore shimmering shadows that transform and captivate, this little duo will surprise you in the best way possible. Trust me‚Äîit‚Äôs like wearing a pocketful of stardust!"

The combination of a cool tone and a warm tone in this duo is just perfect, allowing for creative looks that range from playful to elegant.

Whether I‚Äôm aiming for a subtle wash of shimmering color or a more dramatic, pigmented sparkly look, it delivers beautifully every time. I love that I can create a light, ethereal appearance by applying the shadows with a fluffy brush or go all out with intense shimmer by packing on more product with my fingers or a dense brush.   The shade names are fun and playful as well. I loved hearing Patrick Ta's meaning behind each one, which adds a personal touch to these duos.  I also love that these eyeshadows comes with a built-in mirror inside the compact. It makes application incredibly convenient, especially when I‚Äôm on the go or need a quick touch-up.   Now, I‚Äôm eagerly wanting the other duos in the collection, especially Still At The Club and Do You Know Who I Am! Still At The Club is particularly intriguing to me‚Äîit seems like the perfect sultry option to enhance my green eyes, and I can't resist the allure of those beautiful, rich hues.

It's sleek, and I couldn't wait to try it out. The duo has a fantastic blend of colors that work perfectly for both day and night looks. The pigments are rich and vibrant, providing a bold color payoff that stays put throughout the day.   The application is smooth and effortless, thanks to its creamy texture, which blends like a dream. I loved how easily I could switch up my look from a subtle daytime vibe to a more dramatic evening finish without having to reapply it multiple times.   What truly amazed me was the illusion effect it creates, adding depth and dimension to my eyes that garnered quite a few compliments when I was out.

I think using your finger provides that perfect application. I like to utilize a swipe and drag technique. However a flat eyeshadow brush also works.

Both shades are packed with sparkle, but what really makes them stand out is the variety of glitter sizes. This adds dimension and depth to your eyes, catching the light from different angles and making the eyeshadow appear more intricate than it actually is.  For a softer, scattered sparkle, apply with a brush to give a more diffused, everyday shimmer. But for maximum intensity and shine, use your fingers. The shadows glide on smoothly, and the payoff is amazing, especially when the light catches the different sizes of glitter. It creates a multi-dimensional effect that really makes your eyes pop.  The champagne shade is perfect for highlighting or adding a subtle glow, while the copper shade brings warmth and drama, ideal for evening events. Both shades are incredibly reflective, and I only wish my camera could truly capture their brilliance. These shadows are definitely better suited for a party, date night, or special occasion than for everyday wear. If you‚Äôre after a luxe, high impact look, this eyeshadow duo won‚Äôt disappoint!"

This duo eyeshadow palette retails for $42. after using the palette for about 3 days, applying with a brush and with my finger tips, i can confidently say i would not purchase this duo at full price. Firstly, with a brush the application takes forever. the pigmentation is just not there. on the other hand, with my fingertips the pigmentation was very nice and rich! the glitter is beautiful and the purple is definitely a statement color, the pinkish color is a nice transition color. the packaging is beautiful but it does leave fingerprints all over it. the mirror inside isn‚Äôt really helpful since the palette is longer than it is wide."

This review was collected as part of a promotion, complimentary in exchange for my honest review. I have an olive complexion and hazel eyes, so was thrilled to reveal the ‚ÄúTalk to My Team‚Äù duo shadow colors. They are absolutely, gorgeous and lux! The shadows included in this duo are a champagne sparkle with pink pearl and a copper sparkle with pink pearl. The rose gold compact and mirror equally exudes luxury.   I used a medium size brush to sweep the shadows colors over and above my eyelids, using the lighter, champagne shadow to highlight the copper shade. The colors are pretty and initially appeared subtle. I then layered and blended the shadows to my desired pigment intensity and instantly fell in love with this eye shadow duo. The shimmer is so beautiful with the pink pearl and illuminates perfectly, adding a touch of glam. I applied minimal eyeliner to define my eyes and complete the look for a work event I attended today. I could easily create an evening look using this shadow duo in combination with a more dramatic eyeliner application, along with mascara. Overall, this is a high-end eye shadow duo and a quality product. It is also an added bonus that this product is vegan and cruelty-free. The shadows are long-lasting and still appeared as if I had just applied when I returned home from work nine hours later. I highly recommend Patrick Ta Major Dimension Eye Illusion Eye Shadow Duo ‚ÄúTalk to My Team,‚Äù which has earned a permanent spot in my beauty lineup."

The eyeshadow colors are not too harsh or sharp but only show a gentle level from warm to cool tones with a bit of sparkling finish. Korean eyeshadow makeup style also often tends towards dewy, gentle colors such as earthy pink, peach orange. Eyeshadow will be in powder form to help create a light feeling on the skin surface and is very easy to spread. Besides, eyeshadow powder as well as glitter powder adhere well and do not show streaks on the skin. The product has a rectangular box design with a gentle and lovely peach pink color suitable for sweet and cute people, with an additional side cover like a small mirror if you do not want to open the lid. I love it and am grateful for the opportunity to give my honest review in exchange for this wonderful product."

The shimmer is nothing short of mesmerizing; it‚Äôs a quality you rarely come across in the beauty industry.

Be aware that if you‚Äôre applying it using your finger it may feel rough and gritty at first. It‚Äôs doesn‚Äôt feel rough on the eyes and lays beautifully though . The duo I received (Still at the club) has amazing colors that look great on the lids. Although it has these pros I think it‚Äôs important to understand the cons as well.   After using this for a while one thing that stood out to me was how much it transferred and moved everywhere. I used clean lids, a shadow base, and even set the shadow as well. After doing all of these things the product still transferred terribly and didn‚Äôt stay on for a long time. The pricing of this product knocks one star down also. Considering you can get 12 of his shadows for $70- this seems like a reach for the brand and out of line with his other products. It doesn‚Äôt last long and isn‚Äôt an everyday product that I could see myself reaching for. It‚Äôs nice but not worth the price for the quality."

This duo was beautiful because it is very high shimmer- think crushed pearl, not chunky glitter!  It can be patted on the lid for more densely packed color/glitter or brushed on for a more diffused look.  I like it best on the lid of a cut crease look, layered over a matte color similar in hue.  The shimmer did not irritate my skin or cause any small abrasive marks on my lids, this actually feels like a gel powder!  Very pretty!

Really well done.  **This review was created through an educational promotional event hosted between the brand and beauty experts."

This duo features a a silver and a gold shade. I will say that upon first impression, I was not impressed with the packaging itself. It feels very light and flimsy and I feel as if the first time I drop it, cause we all know it happens, it will be destroyed. I also don‚Äôt find this to be an item that I would take on a trip for fear that it would break. Now let‚Äôs talk about the shades themselves, they are beautiful. They have such a beautiful shimmer to them. I did find that they apply best with the fingers. They are buildable and look absolutely beautiful. Not only are these great for the entire eye, but also great for the inner corner."

I have never tried any of the Patrick Ta products, but I see them at Sephora every time I go but I never take a chance on them or the items I want are out of stock. This palette will have me back at Sephora picking up some more products from him.     Right off the bat, the packaging is so pretty. It is a beautiful rose gold and feels like a quality product. The best though is when you open the palette and see the most beautiful sparkly eyeshadow. The two shades beautifully compliment each other, one a light rose gold and the lighter one a light white gold with a hint of pink. So so pretty.    I did try this a couple different ways and hands down the best way the worked for me was eyeshadow primer as a base and then these directly on top of that. It seemed to stick better than when added on top of other shadows. When used with a primer, I had no issues of the shadow flaking off or the glitter ending up all over my face. It stayed sparkly with no creasing or signs of wear all night.   Very high quality product!"

I have only used a few types of high-end eyeshadow, and the difference between this and cheaper options is incredibly noticeable, even though I hate to admit it! The packaging is  pretty, the shadow is so creamy, there is minimal fallout, the color payoff is intense, and the mirror is useful. I found that it works best if I apply it with my fingers as a finishing touch to add some intensity and sparkle. I put a neutral brown color all over my lid and crease before applying this shadow on top of my lid with my fingers, and it looked awesome. My makeup still looked just as good seven hours after I initially put it on.  I'd like to try more products from Patrick Ta!"

The two shades are gorgeous, very pigmented and so sparkly! I am definitely looking forward to use it during the holidays. I love both shades, I think they complimented each other very well.

I first applied it with my finger and since the eye shadow is compact I did not get much color off it. So it applied very lightly, which I think is perfect for everyday use. Once I applied it with an eye-shadow brush I was able to get more product on it and it had more pigment on un eyes. The eye shadow looked very pretty when the light hit it, it was sparkly and really made my eyes pop. I think these tones are great for a night out but also for casual use."

			"review_text": "I was excited to test out the new Major Dimension Eye Illusion Eyeshadow Duos by Patrick Ta in 'Still At The Club'. This review was collected as part of a promotion, however that does not affect how I feel about the product. My initial impression, I was blown away at how gorgeous the colors are and that this duo in particular is so universally flattering. Top shade is purple leaning taupe, bottom shade is a deep rich chocolate brown. Both have multi dimensional glitter reflects and can be worn separately or layered; my picture shows them separately then combined with the top/lighter shade swatched over the bottom. The top shade definitely has more of a chalky feel while the bottom is smoother. It is worth noting at first application the top shade (regardless of if it was on top of the other or alone) had little to no fallout. However, within 3-4 hours, I did notice quite a bit of sparkle all over my face, and not just under my eyes - it was all over, which was quite disappointing. I did not experience the fallout with the bottom shade alone. I understand sparkle shadows will have some amount of fallout, but this was more than any shadow I have tried in recent memory. I love shadows that give that wet look even when they are dry and the taupe shade definitely delivers that, but at the cost of fallout. I don't use/have eye primer (just use concealer) so I wonder if I try primer if it will yield better results. But, since I typically don't, I was not going to change up my routine just for one eyeshadow duo. I will continue to use this since it's really beautiful - but not an everyday shadow for me due to the fallout. I do think the shades could be everyday shades though, so if I can figure out a way to get less fallout I hope this could become an everyday product for me."

If you want a more bold look use your finger. I love that you can use these as a wash of color or build them up to get a more statement look! Very creamy and easy to blend into other shades. These are extremely high quality! Is it for everyone‚Äôs budget, no. If you want to splurge then I would say go for it cause you won‚Äôt be disappointed in pigmentation or quality.

It has a compact, travel-friendly design with a built-in mirror, making it convenient for on-the-go application. The palette feels luxurious and sturdy, with the magnetic closure providing a sense of security when it‚Äôs tossed into your makeup bag.  Upon opening the palette, the colors immediately catch your eye. The left shade is a shimmery, warm bronze-rose gold that feels perfect for daytime glam or as a versatile base color. The right shade is a deeper, rich berry-rose gold, ideal for creating a more intense, glamorous look for the evening. The shades are highly reflective with a metallic finish, giving them a luxurious feel.  The texture of the shadows is buttery and smooth, gliding on the lids effortlessly. They blend like a dream, making it easy to achieve a seamless transition between the two shades. Even with minimal effort, you can create a sophisticated, well-blended look. Whether you‚Äôre using a fluffy brush for a diffused effect or a flat brush for packing on color, the formula works beautifully in both scenarios.  This palette is perfect for someone who loves soft glam with a touch of luxury. The palette truly stands out in terms of pigmentation, wearability, and its luxurious presentation.

It took me a minute to figure out how to open the compact (it just takes a small twist of the base) but that made me love it all the more. It‚Äôs special, and so are these shadows. The duo I tried, Still at the Club, is full of warm golden glitter, finely milled with plenty of color payoff. I like wearing these shades as a soft wash of color, which still holds plenty of sparkle, but the shadows can be layered for extra drama. For me, these shadows are nighttime only. They are packed full of micro glitter, and there is some fallout, but that‚Äôs a small price to pay because the colors are lovely.

The positives, it‚Äôs gorgeous as a shadow topper, has a comfortable formula that isn‚Äôt too wet or dry and has minimal fallout, the glitter has that multidimensional goodness with beautiful reflects. The amount in the duo palette is more than adequate, leaning towards generous & I love the Patrick Ta packaging. It‚Äôs unique, high quality, and still practical.  Where this misses for me is the color difference in the two shades is minimal. They are incredibly interchangeable & that is a bit of a let down when the product only features two shades. I‚Äôd love it if these were very distinctive and unique shades that provided a different effect as a topper.   Would I recommend this duo? Probably not, I think some of the other shades available in this collection would be a better investment because they would offer a wider variety of looks. It‚Äôs beautiful, no doubt, but I think this specific shade duo is a bit redundant."

It comes in a rectangular case that is gold and mirror like. Once you open it you immediately see the two beautiful sparkling pigments! And on top a very clear mirror for on the go application. It‚Äôs the perfect size for a makeup bag and it looks beautiful sitting in my vanity. The two pigments are light in color but still manage to have a nice pay off. With how sparkly they looked I was pleasantly surprised by how it didn‚Äôt fall off the brush onto my lower eyes. It‚Äôs easily applied alone or on top of like colors and blend very well into your creases. My only thought was it would have been nice for the actual colors to be a little more prominent. I think they are definitely an addition to apply on top of a light corner color and a nice tan or light brown on the outer corners and crease. All in all I was really happy with this duo and I would say I would and will be pleased to purchase another duo or two! This product is for all skin types and eye shapes. I would definitely recommend it. I even played around with it as a highlighter which worked very well!"

			"review_text": "As someone who has been in the beauty and cosmetics industry for nearly 40 years, I‚Äôve experienced a wide range of eyeshadow products across high-end, drugstore, and direct sales brands. I understand the allure of shimmer shades, and I recognize that some professional makeup artists prefer using just two shades for specific looks. However, in my professional experience, most artists strike a balance between matte and shimmer shades, often using a touch of shimmer to enhance the eyes without overwhelming them.  Unfortunately, the two shades in this Patrick Ta Beauty Major Dimension Eye Illusion Duo in Rose Gold Sparkle didn‚Äôt meet my expectations. I found them to be too sheer and similar in tone, which diminished the overall impact. I tried them under different lighting conditions and applied them as recommended, but the colors blended too closely to deliver the contrast I was hoping for. Personally, I prefer more defined colors, especially with matte shades, as they offer more versatility and depth.  The amount of shimmer in this palette felt excessive for such sheer pigmentation. As a woman in my 60s, I found that the shimmer settled into fine lines and creases, making them more noticeable, which is a common concern for mature skin. I believe this product might be better suited for younger individuals with smoother skin, but for more mature skin types, it‚Äôs not flattering. Additionally, I don‚Äôt think these shades work well for fair skin tones, as the colors didn‚Äôt show up prominently. Darker skin tones might have better luck picking up the pigmentation.  When it comes to pricing, I feel this product is on the expensive side for a duo palette. For the cost, I would have expected more variety or perhaps the inclusion of complementary shades like a blush or highlighter. While the sleek packaging and the shades themselves look attractive, the performance didn‚Äôt match the price point in my opinion.  In conclusion, I wouldn‚Äôt recommend this eyeshadow duo for mature clien"

When I have a palette or duo I expect that I should be able to achieve a full eye look. This duo contains only shimmer shades. I only used the darker shade in the crease and the lighter shade on the lid with no additional shadows or primers. If there was a matte shade included it would be better. As well I find the shadows to be a bit difficult to apply smoothly. There is fallout and the shadow ended up settling in lines on my eyelid. The packaging could also use improvement . The way the lid opens is difficult, I expect it to open at the seam but it doesn‚Äôt open that way. In stead the latch lays over the top and I find that design excessive.

The top shade is a metallic copper, and the second shade is a metallic fuchsia, both of which look great with my blue eyes.  These both looked great in the pan and I was eager to try them.  These shadows are smooth to the touch and while they look more metallic, they have micro bits of glitter. I was excited because these two shades reminded me of two shades that were in the Huda Beauty Rose Gold Remastered Palette. I loved that palette and am still sad that it was discontinued!  This is where things took a turn, the color payoff was not what I was expecting.  At first they looked great, but the shades very quickly wore off and after 4 hours, I had glitter in places I didn‚Äôt apply the shadow.  I also noticed that when I was applying my liquid eyeliner that the shadow was lifting off onto my liquid liner brush. I‚Äôll now never be able to use that liquid liner without getting glitter on me.  IT also was not easy to wash off afterward.  I think I washed my face three times and still had flecks of glitter on my face.  Bottom line: These may be great for someone who doesn‚Äôt mind glitter or if you are only going to wear them for a short time but given that the price is $42 for two shadows I wouldn‚Äôt recommend it.  There are plenty of other brands that offer similar shades in full palettes for a better price."

The texture of these eyeshadows is absolutely luxurious. The matte shade is smooth and finely milled, blending effortlessly into the skin without any patchiness. The shimmer shade is equally impressive, boasting a creamy consistency that glides on with ease and reflects light beautifully. One of the unexpected delights was the subtle, pleasant scent. It has a light, fresh fragrance that makes the application process feel indulgent without being overpowering. It‚Äôs a small touch that adds to the overall experience. Application is a dream. The pigmentation is rich yet buildable, allowing for everything from a soft, everyday look to a more dramatic evening appearance. I love that the duo comes with a perfect balance of matte and shimmer, making it incredibly versatile. The shadows adhere well and last throughout the day without creasing. What‚Äôs even more impressive is the skin-loving formula. Infused with nourishing ingredients, I found that my eyelids felt hydrated and didn‚Äôt dry out, which can be a common issue with many eyeshadows. It‚Äôs great knowing I‚Äôm using a product that‚Äôs not just pretty but also beneficial for my skin. Using the ‚ÄúI‚Äôm with Her‚Äù duo has truly elevated my makeup game.

This gorgeous Eyeshadow Duo has the perfect pink & peach shade which i have been looking for so long. It is the best shimmery shade a girl can have. It‚Äôs staying power is so good. It doesn‚Äôt budge & stay whole day as it is. The color stays vibrant without creasing which is a huge thing for me. This has become my go-to in my routine. It is vegan & cruelty free another reason to love this duo. If i talk about the packaging it is the most sleek design i have ever seen of any eyeshadow palette.  It has unique design & the way it needs to be opened is also so different, i just loved it. It is just perfect in everyway. I would definitely recommend it to every girl to go grab it & love it & own it.   *This review is collected as part of a collaboration*"

However, I applied the product over a neutral matte lid with a fluffy brush and when doing so the glitter particles dusted everywhere. It was an easy clean up and not initially as much shimmer and more glitter. I realized this should be used as a stand alone on a well primed eye with a dense brush so that it can be packed in to achieve the best payoff. In addition, I would not suggest this for someone with fine lines and wrinkles, this is a product for a younger demographic. I will be using it again in a different manner to see its versatility.

This eyeshadow duo is a dream for those who love a touch of sparkle! The two brown shades are highly pigmented and have a beautiful shimmer that catches the light. They also glide on smoothly and blend effortlessly with each other, creating a variety of looks.  While the colors are intense, it may take a few layers to achieve the desired intensity, especially on lighter skin tones. The eyeshadows have excellent staying power, lasting throughout the day without fading. However, I did notice a tendency for them to crease, particularly in the deeper folds of my eyelid. A good eyeshadow primer can help to minimize this issue, as I did notice on the days that I actually took the time to apply an eyeshadow primer, the creasing was slightly less.  Upon opening the palette, I was immediately struck by the stunning gold-toned packaging. It felt like I was unwrapping a solid gold brick! The luxurious exterior added to the overall appeal of the product.  Overall, Patrick Ta's Major Dimension Eye Illusion Eyeshadow Duo Still At The Club is a great addition to any makeup collection. The beautiful shimmer, easy application, and luxurious packaging make it a versatile choice for both day and night looks. I can't wait to try the other colors!"

What I loved the most about these shadows is the zero fall-out! Generally I do my base after the eyes if I‚Äôm wearing pearl-based shadows but with these I dont have to! Even when I add on more color to darken the crease, there‚Äôs usually no fall-out at all. The pearls in these are iridescent and look absolutely gorgeous. They complement the opaque shades so well and beautifully create a multi dimensional look. They are really long-wearing too even without any glitter glue or primer. I have to say it‚Äôs on the pricier side but it is because of the high-end components that went into making them so it‚Äôs really up to you to decide whether it fits your budget!"

I like more of a smokey eye myself, so I patted my finger on it and dabbed on the center of my eye to make it pop. I'm giving this 4 stars because I used a brush and it brushed on very sheer. The shadow must be really tightly packed. I thought more would adhere to the brush, so I resorted to rubbing my finger over it to get a fuller coverage for my smokey eye.

Spoiler alert: I‚Äôm impressed. First off, the packaging is luxe. I‚Äôm a sucker for aesthetics, and the sleek compact makes it feel like a little treat every time I reach for it. It‚Äôs lightweight but still feels expensive‚Äîdefinitely something you‚Äôd expect from Patrick Ta.  I got the duo called Still at the Club and love both the shades they compliment each other so well for that bold and Smokey eye effect. They have a sparkle or shimmer effect but it‚Äôs not too extreme so it blends well if you do the crease of your lid in the cocoa and then the lid blended together with the sepia color. I have loved it. I love makeup by Patrick Ta so this is another stellar addition to the line of products! In terms of wear, it‚Äôs solid. I used a primer (as I always do), and the shadows held up through a full shift of blowouts, extensions, and color treatments. I‚Äôm talking 10 hours without needing to touch up, which is exactly what I need in a product. You barely need to dip your brush, and the pigment grabs immediately. For a busy stylist like me who needs makeup to last from morning clients through a dinner out, this formula didn‚Äôt disappoint. No fallout and minimal creasing, even after a long day under salon lights. What really impressed me was the blendability. Whether I was doing a subtle wash of color or layering for something more dramatic, the shadows blended effortlessly. You know how some high-pigment shadows can skip or get patchy when you try to buff them out? None of that here. Overall, if you‚Äôre someone like me‚Äîbalancing a fast-paced life in the beauty world with a love for high-quality, easy-to-use products‚Äîyou‚Äôll love this duo. It‚Äôs chic, it performs, and it‚Äôs now a staple in my kit. I don‚Äôt have to use anything else on my eyes when I have worn this product bc it literally does the trick and it stays put."

I can confidently say that they are a game changer.  The eyeshadows have an elegant design and are of high quality. The formula is exceptional, with pigmented shadows that blend seamlessly. The duos feature a balance of matte and shimmer shades, allowing for versatile looks. The matte shades have a soft, velvety finish, while the shimmer shades have the right amount of sparkle. These duos are perfect for both daytime and evening looks and are compact enough for travel. They delivered impressive results for hours without any creasing or fading.  I highly recommend these eyeshadows for anyone who loves makeup."

			"review_text": "I am a big fan of sparkly eyes, and Patrick delivers! This gorgeous duo has a really pretty pearl sparkle that looks beautiful by itself for a quick, one-and-done soft glam look, but it can also be used over another eyeshadow to give a really dramatic effect.  The other shade is golden sparkle and it also looks so good by itself, it also can be used with another color with no issues.  These are very easy to blend with a fluffy brush, but I found a clean finder gave me the most payoff for actual application.  If you love brushes I would use a more compact application brush.  The duo's formula is really easy to work with, you don't need a lot of work to get great color payoff.  The product comes in a sturdy compact with a mirror inside it so it could easily be popped in your bag for a touch-up.  I am very fair and both colors looked great on me and had no issues with my sensitive skin.  Overall, these are great and can really add some drama to your looks or you can use them more subtly for a softer look.  I'm looking forward to getting more."

			"review_text": "As a makeup lover, you know the excitement of discovering a new product from a renowned makeup artist. This eyeshadow duo from Patrick Ta is a gorgeous addition to any makeup collection.   The shadows themselves are stunning metallic neutrals that are versatile enough to wear alone or pair with other shades. The color payoff is impressive, and both shades are buildable, allowing you to create everything from a subtle everyday look to a more dramatic evening effect. They blend seamlessly with a brush, making application a breeze.   One of my favorite techniques is to apply the lighter shade on the inner corners of my eyes using my fingers or a wide, tapered eyeshadow brush. This adds a brightening effect that opens up the eyes, perfect for achieving that natural, fresh look. The powder formula glides on smoothly which makes it easy to layer without any patchiness.  As someone who embraces a natural makeup style with a soft glow, these shadows are a dream come true. They enhance my features without overwhelming them, offering just the right amount of shimmer to elevate my everyday look. The combination of colors is not only flattering but also versatile enough to transition seamlessly into more standout looks for special occasions.  This duo is a must-have for anyone who loves makeup. Whether you‚Äôre looking to keep it simple or amp up your glam for a night out, these shadows are sure to become a staple in your beauty routine. I can‚Äôt wait to see how they work with my other products and styles! Bonus - the case is not only chic but also practical, perfectly embodying the high-end brand aesthetic."

			"review_text": "As a beauty enthusiast, I was thrilled to try the Patrick Ta palette in Talk to My Team. However, I quickly realized that I should've opted for a different color set. The shades in this palette were too similar to my skin tone, causing them to blend in too well. Unfortunately, this resulted in a look that was like glitter over my dark circles rather than a flattering enhancement.  On the positive side, the formula itself is excellent. The eye shadow applies super smoothly and has impressive staying power throughout the day. I appreciate the quality, which is why I rated it 3 stars. My main issue stems from personal preference‚ÄîI tend to gravitate towards neutral colors, but the glittery finish didn't complement the shades I chose, as I had hoped. I‚Äôll definitely keep searching for the right shades that work for me!  This review was collected as part of a promotion."

			"review_text": "I recently tried up the Patrick Ta Major Dimension Eyeshadow Duo, and I have to say, I‚Äôm pretty impressed! As someone who loves a good neutral eye look but also wants that extra touch of glam, this duo hits the sweet spot.  First Impressions Right off the bat, the packaging is beautiful! It's sleek, feels high-end, and has a nice weight to it, which always makes me feel like I‚Äôm getting something luxurious. Plus, the compact is the perfect size to toss into my makeup bag, and it even has a mirror (yay for convenience!).  Formula & Texture Now, let‚Äôs talk about the shadows themselves. The duo comes with a matte and a shimmer, and both are stunning. The matte shade is buttery smooth‚Äîlike, it glides on without any of that annoying patchiness. It blends out so effortlessly that even if you‚Äôre in a rush, you can still make it look like you spent way more time on your makeup. The shimmer shade is gorgeous, too‚Äîsuper fine and more of a glow than an in-your-face glitter, which I love. I can apply it with my finger when I‚Äôm in a hurry, and it gives this beautiful, light-catching effect.  How I Use It What I really appreciate about this duo is how versatile it is. Some days I‚Äôll just throw the matte shade all over my lid for a quick, soft look, and other times I‚Äôll layer the shimmer on top for more dimension. It‚Äôs perfect for going from day to night without having to completely redo my makeup. And the shades? They just work. They‚Äôre neutral but not boring, and they really complement a range of skin tones (including mine, which can sometimes be tricky to match with warm tones).  Staying Power One thing that really won me over is how long these shadows last. I have pretty oily eyelids, so creasing can be a problem for me, but these hold up all day. Seriously, they don‚Äôt budge, and the color stays vibrant, which is a huge win in my book.  Overall, the Patrick Ta Eyeshadow Duo has become a go-to in my makeup routine."

The brown is a deep cool toned brown with shimmer. The lighter shade is a perfect beige-y silver that makes my eyes POP. I was able to do an eye look with just these two shades. Both shades applied so smoothly and the payoff was amazing. The shimmer does not fall or move which, in my opinion is the most important factor when using a glitter eyeshadow. I wore my make up all day at an outside event and by the time I got home it looked no different from when I first applied it. This eyeshadow duo would be perfect to travel with for concerts or festivals being that it is bold but in small packaging."

I found that applying with your fingers gives it a more sheer look. The only reason I gave this product 4/5 stars is because the product is more on the expensive side, especially for only two shades.

I‚Äôve gotten compliments on my sparkly eyes tons of times for the past weeek. I I enjoy that there is no fall out meaning no need for a glitter glue or a tacky base, however I did try it with a setting spray and it intensiveld the pigment a lot more a from underneath the shimmers and that made it really pretty. A little goes a long way with these shimmers. Perfect timing for the holiday season. 10:10 id recommend these and gift it to someone if I know a glitter/shimmer lover because these are a great add on to your collection."

When I applied it on my eyelids using my eyeshadow brush, it was smooth, precise, silky and popped out instantly.  I used the rose shimmer as the base and the gold shimmer as the contour.  I layered a lot of the rose and about 2 layers of gold for contour and it was a beautiful look.  This pallet is great quality and applies easily like silk.

			"review_text": "The first time I tried Patrick Ta‚Äôs makeup, I was pleasantly surprised by the quality. With over two decades of experience experimenting with makeup, I've developed a selective approach, especially with my sensitive combination skin that tends to lean oily. This makes me cautious about what I apply to my face.  Eyeshadow duos don't usually excite me‚Äîthey often underperform or come in combinations that don‚Äôt work for me. But Patrick Ta‚Äôs Talk To My Team duo changed my mind. With two gorgeous shades in one compact, it‚Äôs versatile enough for both day and night. Since I attend a lot of evening events, it‚Äôs become a go-to in my makeup routine, perfectly balancing a clean, classic style while still adding a bit of glam.  Here‚Äôs why I rated it a solid 4/5:  üéÄ Pigmentation: The payoff is gorgeous. The shadows don‚Äôt apply too heavily with the first swipe, which I like because it lets me build the intensity. The gleam is subtle yet eye-catching, without causing flashback in pictures‚Äîgreat for events.  üéÄ Application: You can use a brush for a soft, glittery look or your fingers for a more intense payoff. It does take a few swipes to get full opacity, which makes it flexible‚Äîperfect for subtle or bold looks.  üéÄ Packaging: The mirrored rose gold packaging is a standout. It feels luxurious, like a piece of art in my collection, enhancing the overall experience.  üéÄ Shade Selection: Talk To My Team includes a beautiful pearl-champagne and coppery-pink shade. Both are flattering on light to medium skin tones, though I found the coppery-pink shade applies more smoothly and is more pigmented than the champagne.  ‚ùå Cons: The one downside is how easily it wipes off, especially for oily lids. Without primer, it fades faster than I‚Äôd like. I recommend using a primer if you want it to last through the day or night.  I give this duo a strong 4/5. I love how it allows me to control the intensity, whether I‚Äôm going for a lighter everyday look or a bolder eye for evening events."

Patrick Ta knows how to make amazing colors with good staying power. I love how these colors really make your eyelid pop! The texture is smooth and doesn't fall out under the eye.  The most important thing for me is that Patrick Ta's brand products are gluten-free, cruelty-free, and paraben-free.The variety of colors of these duos are spectacular for any occasion day or night.  I highly recommend all of Patrick Ta's products."

Upon applying the eyeshadow I will say you don‚Äôt need a lot to get the coverage you want as it‚Äôs very pigmented so I was constantly making sure to apply with a smaller makeup brush to enhance my eye makeup but found that it does leave residue on your face.

It immediately dresses up your eyes and makes them look stunning. This eyeshadow works great as a topper or placing in the inner corners of your eyes. I've also used it as a highlighter because the shimmer is so pretty. I havent experienced any fallout with the eyeshadow, but I do use a primer. Overall, a great, very pretty eyeshadow duo from Patrick Ta!"

The colors are beautiful, and the shine is gorgeous. The bottom darker shade can be used as a one-and-done shade that isn't too sparkly if used with a brush; however, the top shade is definitely where the sparkle is. The first time I used this I used my finger, and the pay off is insane, and honestly a bit much for everyday wear. I've since been using it with a brush for a more light wash of color and sparkle, which looks better for everyday wear. The pans are larger than I expected so they will last quite a long time, however, the price is a bit steep and that's why I knocked a star off. I have oily eyelids and with primer, the eyeshadow lasted roughly 8-9 hours before creasing. Overall, it's lovely and I do recommend the eyeshadow, but at a discounted price. I wouldn't pay full price as there are other cheaper alternatives."

That said let‚Äôs talk about Patrick Ta‚Äôs eyeshadow formulas. If you aren‚Äôt used to using them, especially the shimmers, you might think they are a bit dry. And you‚Äôd be right. BUT there is a certain technique if you will, that I have found to be the only way to get the full experience with them. Using an eyeshadow brush no matter how dense or fluffy isn‚Äôt likely to give you the true beauty that is a Patrick Ta shimmer. I‚Äôm not certain what tool he uses with them but I have found that your finger is the absolute best and only way to get the true color and beauty from these shadows. After applying with your finger you can go in with a fluffy brush to diffuse the edges. This is an absolute stunning duo in my opinion and I‚Äôd love to get the other shades however $48 is a bit too much for a shimmer duo. Perhaps if he‚Äôd done a matte and shimmer I would consider. Either way, they are definitely beautiful, definitely high quality, and definitely pigmented and shimmery! A perfect blend for a party scene! Though the price is a bit high, I still give it 10/10!!

It really could be that I'm silly brained, but it took me way too long to figure out how to open it. But once you get inside, there are to near identical shades of metallic eyeshadow. Now I love a good copper eyeshadow, and these are definitely that. But neither one looks different once applied to the eye. You do have to work with them a little to get them to apply. I suggest wetting a brush with some makeup setting spray, that seems like the best way to get it to really apply and show up. Otherwise they can be kind of light, which if you like a light wash of shimmer these are perfect for that too. I am just confused on why they're so identical, but otherwise I think they're super nice and will continue to use them!"

The packaging is sleek, stylish, and super functional‚Äîperfect for on-the-go use with its built-in mirror. It‚Äôs so thoughtfully designed, and I just love how sophisticated it feels.  The duo comes with two gorgeous shades: a lighter, soft hue, and a deeper pinkish-purple that‚Äôs totally my signature color. Both shades are incredibly pigmented‚Äîa little goes a long way and it lasts all day! I love the versatility of the lighter shade for creating subtle, everyday looks, while the deeper shade brings the perfect drama for an evening out. This eyeshadow stays put for hours, making me feel like a queen all night long.  I enjoyed this product so much that I‚Äôm already eyeing other shades in the collection. If you haven‚Äôt tried Patrick Ta yet, you‚Äôre seriously missing out!"
