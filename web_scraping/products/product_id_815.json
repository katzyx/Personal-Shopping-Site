It has other great benefits, including frizz control, softer hair, and it smells awesome. After using, I can't go as many days without washing my hair as I have in the past, but totally worth it to get the freshness of this product again."

I used the Blowout Styling Milk and Instant Recovery Serum for extra heat protection and loved my results. It's not weighing my hair down or making it feel greasy; it's light, silky, and feels clean with no strong smell. I would definitely recommend it. I'd finish it off with some Shine Drops or any hair oil you have to smooth down any flyaways! I feel like I got salon results."

The immediate difference it is making in my hair is incredible and it’s this line of products from JVN. My hair is softer than its ever been, has a beautiful shine and bounce to it. My hair does not typically react well to leave ins and gets so oily the second day, but that was not the case with this product. To be fair, I did watch a few videos online of how to use this for best results so applying a small amount from middle to ends (not just slopping it on the roots). But after applying, using only a round brush and hair dryer - I was ready to walk out the door to work. Nothing else was needed. This is going on my must-have list. And bonus it smells amazing."

They recommend using 1-2 pumps, but because my hair is thick I used about 2.5 pumps and my hair didn't really feel soft or hydrated after blow-drying (I used the Dyson Supersonic + Olivia Garden round brush). In the pic I attached my hair looks decent because I used a flat iron and finished it with Oribe Gold Lust hair oil, but it doesn't feel soft when I touch it (even with the hair oil). Before flat ironing my hair looked a little poofier, less shiny, and my ends didn't feel as nice as when I use my other blowout product. I also feel like my ends are getting tangled more easily, whereas my other blowout product leaves my hair super silky and smooth and I can run my fingers through my hair mor easily. Basically I was hoping to get a silky, soft and smooth result with just the Blowout Milk and avoid using a flat iron, but this product didn't do that for me."

I wash my hair once a week instead of every 3-4 days and it has a great scent. I have long, fine hair and use a pea sized amount. I always feel like I didn't put any product on my hair but once I blowdry I can tell I put the right amount in. If I use a dime size amount hair will be slightly soft but a greasy feel. Still looks good but I bet if I did more than a dime it would be a bad hair day so if there's anyone not enjoying it just use barely a pump. Rub it all over your palms then glaze over your hair and wash the rest off your hands. Less is more!"

			"review_text": "So far, I really like this product. I’ve been blowing my hair out as my preferred method for styling for over a decade. I’ve tried many products over the years that have worked to varying degrees, but the main things I look for as a curly-haired girly are: something that leaves my ends (which are extremely damage-prone) soft, sleek and styled; a product that doesn’t sweat out at my roots and leave my crown “puffy” at the slightest sign of humidity; and a product that leaves my hair with a NATURAL shine that isn’t greasy.  I came upon JVN Complete Blowout Styling Milk after a lengthy search for a new blowout cream to replace my Monat (yes, I’m aware of the complaints) Studio One Blowout Cream, which has been my Holy Grail for the last 3 years. I was looking for a natural, clean product that I didn’t have to maintain a subscription for.  JVN Complete Blowout Styling Milk seems to be doing the trick more than anything else I’ve tried. I would say it checks 2 out of 3 boxes. Styling my curly hair with solid products reduces my blowout time by 20-30 minutes, this is on par with other good products I’ve used (2 minutes from pic #1 to pic #2). My ends are soft and cooperated with my round brush, my roots are lying flat with intentional volume in the correct places. However, I did not immediately notice a natural shine post-styling. My face framing pieces felt a little staticky and I feel like the end product was beautifully styled, but a little dull. Perhaps my natural hair oils over the next day or so will correct this, or perhaps I can try JVN’s Complete Nourishing Hair Oil Shine Drops next!  The product smells amazing and is NOT overpowering at all. Smells just like any other salon hair care product. It’s not heavy. It’s definitely a cream, but a lighter cream that feels quite hydrating. My hair is long, mid-torso length, and somewhat thick. I used 2.5 pumps combed through evenly and that didn’t weigh my hair down or make it feel oily at all. For finer hair, I suggest s"

Hair care products are usually the lowest on my priority list in terms of things to buy or try, so I likely never would have picked this up on my own. That said, the product is really nice. It has a scent I would say is gender neutral with a sort of crisp, cucumber-y kind of vibe. It's not my favourite but it's also not very strong so you won't be catching whiffs of it all day. When I used it I did notice that my hair seemed shinier and smoother after blowing it out and I usually have quite a bit of frizz and flyaways. It makes my hair look so much nicer that I now actually look forward to blow drying my hair."

MY HAIR TYPE / CONDITION: Stick straight, color treated hair in need of volume at the crown. Individual hair strands are fine, but I have a lot of strands so my hair can look thicker than it actually is.   WHAT I LIKE: * lightweight * does not weigh hair down * does not leave hair greasy  * easy to apply * serves as a heat protectant * works nicely as a detangler * leaves hair soft, silky smooth, sleek and shiny, with movement and fullness to it * zero frizz * hair looks and feels healthy * a little goes a long way  AREA(S) FOR IMPROVEMENT: * None, I can think of   FYI / OTHER THOUGHTS: * Has that signature JVN scent found in shampoo and conditioner in the brand's Nurture line. To my nose, it's a mix of fresh, sweet, fruity, floral, woodsy notes, that smells wonderful! *  My hair is so soft and silky smooth that I can't stop touching my hair on days I use this product  BUY, BUY, BUY or BYE-BYE?: * It'll take me a while to make my way through this styling milk, and I plan to purchase another bottle when I do. This is a BUY, BUY, BUY in my book.  * Highly recommend"

At first I was a little hesitant to use the styling milk because it was my first time using a product like this.

After thoroughly coating my hair, I blow dried it. My hair is a combination of curly and straight hair and is difficult to maintain; however, this product left my hair feeling soft and with little to no frizz! It has a lovely scent to it and left my hair with a healthy shine to it. I only used it about once or twice a week and it worked wonders! The packaging of the product is also very chic and definitely meant to be out on display on the vanity. Overall, I love this product and I am looking forward to continue using this as a staple in my hair care routine and trying more items from this company!"

Unfortunately it tends to look limp and lacks volume, especially near the roots, when I use heat protectants and smoothing products while straightening my hair.   Blowout Styling Milk is a styling product and heat protectant in one. The less products I have to used, the better! I own a few JVN products and love that they all have in goal in mind, frizz free hair, and the products really work!   Humidity is a big issue in South Florida and my hair loves to curl as soon as I step out of the door. The Blowout Styling Milk not only protects my hair from heat damage, it also helps to keep my straightened hair straight longer. I’ve also noticed that I spend less time doing touch ups in the mornings as well."

There is nothing about this styling milk that I do not love! I have fine hair, and a lot of products tend to weigh it down and that is what I adore about this stuff. It doesn’t weigh my hair down. It doesn’t make it feel like I have any extra product in my hair. Definitely recommend if you’re struggling at finding a heat styling protective product and you have fine hair."

Admittedly, it took a little bit of trial-and-error to figure out how to use it to get the best results because I have fine, straight hair and too much of this can absolutely weigh it down and leave it feeling sticky.  My personal best method is to use a single pump, apply it to barely towel-dried hair, and comb it through to distribute it well before blow-drying and I usually end up with softer, smoother hair.  Going overboard with the application definitely doesn't have the same effect, though, so I would advise experimenting with the amount used.  Overall I do like it although I feel like it's a slightly finicky product for me, personally, but I enjoy it enough that I use it often because I appreciate the end result.  *Generously gifted to me as a Sephora Community Ambassador"

I initially tried two pumps on my med-long hair, then the next time tried just one pump. I loved the way it left my hair looking and feeling post blow out - it’s the strong scent I can’t get past. It lingers far beyond the blow out. If you are scent sensitive, this might be too fragrant for you."

It helps detangle which makes my blow outs so much easier and leaves w wonderful shine to my hair. When I use this and then curl my hair the curls last a few days longer with the style memory and I love that!"
