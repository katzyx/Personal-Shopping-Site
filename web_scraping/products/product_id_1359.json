I think I fell for the packaging. The metal applicator looks nice but ends up being quite messy since the gloss is thin and the tube leaks. I consider this more of a glossy lip balm like the Summer Fridays balm and not a true gloss. The formula is very thin not sticky, which means itu2019s gone in minutes. If youu2019re looking for a sheer gloss that feels nice on the lips and isnu2019t sticky, I love the Romand Glasting glosses. The colors are sheer and the consistency of the gloss is almost like a gel so it stays on the lips without being sticky. If youu2019re looking for a gloss gloss that lasts and makes your lips look juicy, you need a sticky gloss. Lawless and Makeup by Mario are my two current favorites for real lipgloss. Not recommended."

Is this product exactly half the price of my Dior lip oils, yup! Love that! Unfortunately, itu2019s not a product Iu2019m going to use because the longevity is less than an hour without drinking/eating anything. Iu2019d pop this in my purse for grocery trips and such but based on reviews and just using it at home positioned upwards in my lipstick carousel, it still leaks a little.

I have ordered two of these and while I do love the colors and consistency, I won't be repurchasing due to the amount of leakage. If you don't leave the tube upright, it will leak out into the cap. It's not a cheap gloss and you lose a big amount due to leaking. Leaving it upright means you can't freely throw it in your bag unless you have a special pocket you can leave it upright in. This is another tube I ordered and upon opening it straight out of the package, it had already leaked before I ever used it. Until they fix this issue, I sadly won't be buying any more of them."

But what I really really love is using this as a primer for my lipstick. This gloss seems to grip your mouth in a comfortable way and it is a little tacky. Applied sparingly it is the perfect layer of moisture under my lipstick and really helps my lipstick glide on and stay on, lipstick becomes very comfortable and long-wearing and my lips look hydrated and smooth. was genuinely surprised that I liked this product! Now I carry it in my pocket. Also the fact that it has no smell and no taste is HUGE. I hate flavored, scented makeup!"

I've cleaned out the top so many times, probably half the product has been wasted by now. I've tried screwing it closed very tight as well as just normal, and it makes no difference. It doesn't matter if it's in my bag or sitting on a counter, it just keeps leaking into the top. So disrespectful to the consumer. I've emailed the Refy team and gotten no response.

However there is something wrong with the packaging design, maybe having to do with the tube being overfilled. The first one I had to toss because it was laying down tightly shut and leaked everywhere. The second one, I cannot bring anywhere with me. I store it upright in a lipstick type organizer with the cap facing up, and it still has managed to leak EVERYWHERE! I want to keep using this product but it needs work on the package before I buy another one."

This truly is fragrance free which I like a lot in a clear gloss (just my personal preference) Itu2019s not sticky and the shine is so pretty, itu2019s not over the top shiny or anything but definitely glossy still. I adore the applicator on this, itu2019s unique and feels really nice upon application. It is definitely hydrating I do not experience any dryness after wearing this, if anything my lips feel softer than before. I highly recommend this lipgloss, I only deducted a star because it doesnu2019t last as long as Iu2019d like it to however Iu2019d like to point out that most glosses Iu2019ve tried donu2019t last long anyway. I will keep repurchasing this."
