			"review_text": "I bought this, didn’t like it and then bought it again because I had completely forgotten. That’s how memorable it was at the time. I think I fell for the packaging. The metal applicator looks nice but ends up being quite messy since the gloss is thin and the tube leaks. I consider this more of a glossy lip balm like the Summer Fridays balm and not a true gloss. The formula is very thin not sticky, which means it’s gone in minutes. If you’re looking for a sheer gloss that feels nice on the lips and isn’t sticky, I love the Romand Glasting glosses. The colors are sheer and the consistency of the gloss is almost like a gel so it stays on the lips without being sticky. If you’re looking for a gloss gloss that lasts and makes your lips look juicy, you need a sticky gloss. Lawless and Makeup by Mario are my two current favorites for real lipgloss. Not recommended."

I couldn’t get it to stop leaking and ended up buying an empty lip gloss tube and transferring my lip gloss into the new tube. Kind of disappointing when the product is already pricey and then I had to spend more money on packaging myself. It’s still my favorite lipgloss but buyer beware— the packaging makes it near unusable."

I removed and reapplied my lipstick with Dior lip oil, and it is still on after dinner, dessert, and I’ve been home for a half hour. Is this product exactly half the price of my Dior lip oils, yup! Love that! Unfortunately, it’s not a product I’m going to use because the longevity is less than an hour without drinking/eating anything. I’d pop this in my purse for grocery trips and such but based on reviews and just using it at home positioned upwards in my lipstick carousel, it still leaks a little. I’d be super bummed if it got all over my purse. Nope. Hard pass on this one."

It's a beautiful gloss that's not too thick but thick enough for staying power. If you're looking for something super thin, this might not be for you. I have ordered two of these and while I do love the colors and consistency, I won't be repurchasing due to the amount of leakage. If you don't leave the tube upright, it will leak out into the cap. It's not a cheap gloss and you lose a big amount due to leaking. Leaving it upright means you can't freely throw it in your bag unless you have a special pocket you can leave it upright in. This is another tube I ordered and upon opening it straight out of the package, it had already leaked before I ever used it. Until they fix this issue, I sadly won't be buying any more of them."

I like that it’s not too shiny and I like that there’s no wand, so it applies easily without a mirror and I can truly control how much product I am appt and exactly where, wit just feels less gross over time and more portable because of it’s size. But what I really really love is using this as a primer for my lipstick. This gloss seems to grip your mouth in a comfortable way and it is a little tacky. Applied sparingly it is the perfect layer of moisture under my lipstick and really helps my lipstick glide on and stay on, lipstick becomes very comfortable and long-wearing and my lips look hydrated and smooth. was genuinely surprised that I liked this product! Now I carry it in my pocket. Also the fact that it has no smell and no taste is HUGE. I hate flavored, scented makeup!"

I've cleaned out the top so many times, probably half the product has been wasted by now. I've tried screwing it closed very tight as well as just normal, and it makes no difference. It doesn't matter if it's in my bag or sitting on a counter, it just keeps leaking into the top. So disrespectful to the consumer. I've emailed the Refy team and gotten no response. I really want to love this, but I'm scared to take it anywhere, because it leaks and gets on my stuff and on my hands when I got to open it."

I store it upright in a lipstick type organizer with the cap facing up, and it still has managed to leak EVERYWHERE!
