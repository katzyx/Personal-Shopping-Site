			"review_text": "These are incredible, I always am blown away when I use them and get a ton of compliments. I will say, the formula does have a bit of a learning curve. If you want a shadow underneath for a more opaque look, you'll need to do some testing to figure out how to apply it without rubbing off your other makeup (small, flat brush works the best for me). You also will definitely feel these on your lids no matter how dry it is - but i've never had irritation the next day. The pros speak for itself, just look at it. These look INSANE in low light, I feel like a goddess when I wear it. The color shift is also definitely noticeable after applying."

			"review_text": "The color shift in these is truly magical! There was a bit of a learning curve for applying this formula, applying in thin layers with a small flat brush is what works best for me. Wearing more layers on the lid was a bit uncomfortable but I did get used to it. Lasted all day and came off very easily when washed. The flecks seem to dissolve in water so they did not scratch my eye, yay!"
