	"about": "Fragrance Family:Earthy & Woody.Scent Type:Citrus & Woods.Key Notes:Golden Grasses, Olive Wood, Pink Pistachio.Fragrance Description:This is a citrus and woody fragrance that combines enveloping notes of grasses with the strength of olive wood and the tenderness of fresh pistachio..About the Bottle:Designed by Fred Rawyler, the bottle is inspired by the lines of the horse-drawn-carriage lanterns of yesteryear. The luminous yellow glass echoes the sunny fragrance. On the box, artist Elias Kafouros sketches a colorful landscape of his homeland: golden grasses, green olive trees, fresh pink pistachios, and in the background, the blue of the sea..About the Fragrance:Created by Herm√®s' perfumer Christine Nagel, Un Jardin a Cyth√®re Eau de Toilette is a surprising garden that is neither green nor floral, but... blond. It is the expression of an olfactory quest through Greece that leads to Kythira, a picturesque island that has inspired many artists.",
	"ingredients": "Alcohol, Parfum  (Fragrance),  Aqua  (Water), Benzyl  Salicylate, Limonene,  Alpha-Isomethyl  Ionone,  Ethylhexyl  Salicylate,  Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Methyl  Anthranilate, Linalool, Coumarin, Citral, Pentaerythrityl Tetra-Di-T-Butyl  Hydroxyhydrocinnamate,  Citronellol, Hydroxycitronellal, Geraniol, Benzyl Alcohol, Tris(Tetramethylhydroxypiperidinol) Citrate, Eugenol, Disodium Edta...This list is subject to change over time. Please refer to the information on your product‚Äôs packaging for the most up-to-date list of ingredients.",
	"how_to_use": "Suggested Usage:.-Fragrance is intensified by the warmth of your own body. Apply in the creases of your knees and elbows for a longer-lasting, stronger scent.&nbsp;.-After applying, avoid rubbing or dabbing skin. This breaks down the fragrance, causing it to wear off more quickly.&nbsp;.-If you prefer placing fragrance on your wrists, be sure to reapply after frequent handwashing, as this tends to rinse off the scent.&nbsp;.-Replace fragrance after 12 months. Expired perfumes more than a year old lose the integrity of the original scent... Eau de Toilette or Eau de Parfum?: .The difference lies in the volume of perfume oil. While EDT contains five to nine percent, EDP contains more, usually eight to 14 percent. EDPs, therefore, last longer and smell more intense.",

			"review_text": "It's a light lemony green powdery smelling perfume. Could be used for everyday wear but personally I don't find that it gives that *pop* that I'm looking for. It's subtle and in the background so it would definitely have to be layered. Couldn't decide whether to return or keep but I think I'll keep it since it's just a travel size and can come in handy at some point."

			"review_text": "starts citrusy and dries down powdery on me. It is not as green/fresh as the other jardin series. I feel more adult-ish wearing this than wearing sur le nil or sur le toit, but it is still casual enough for daily wear. However, I do not think I will be purchasing this in a full size."

			"review_text": "what a pleasant surprise! It was a blind purchase and I got it because I'm a sucker for the herm√®s jardin collection -  and this one certainly didn't disappoint! It's different from its peers though, falling more on the citrusy side than floral. It opens with a freshly squeezed lemon scent then dries down into a mix between powdery flowers and fresh pistachios. It's a very fresh scent yet unique and sophisticated. Perfect for sunny days."
