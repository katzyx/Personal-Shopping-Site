I also didn't like the blendability of that product as well and so when the topper on my foundation broke, I decided to hunt for a new one.  I went in to a Sephora and after discussing it with a Beauty Advisor, we both agreed this might be a great option. I'm so glad I went in for a shade match and kuddos to Fenty Beauty for delivering on a shade that perfectly matched my skin. I also love the blendability and coverage. This stuff is amazing!!"

It shouldn’t be that hard so I give up after 3 different attempts."

			"review_text": "It's not a terrible foudnation but not great either and for the price, it's ridiculous.  It blends nicely but has an oily appearance and sits on the skin even with setting powder it starts to melt - especially on the nose if you wear glasses you will see how it separates and polls around the nose pads. It doesn't do well with most cream contour, it wipes off when you try to blend in the contour. Used with several primers. It does transfer a bit. Good for a quick makeup and if you don't need to wear it all day."

The finish on this is stunning. Has that ambient glow to it but also sets on the face nicely, unlike some of the other foundations in this category that either slide around all day or dry me out. Is not heavy at all on the skin at all. It straight up looks like you have nothing on but just naturally flawless skin.   One con I will say is that it takes an uncomfortably long time to get to the shade it ultimately gets to once it dries down completely. The whole time I was doing my makeup I was like, is this really not going to match me after I swatched this in-store so many times. It eventually did, but it takes AWHILE, like once you’re finished with your makeup. The shade also leans a bit more golden than I was expecting based on the photos, but I can make it work. I just might try a different, cooler shade next time.   It outperforms $70 foundations, so it’s a yes from me."

I hate it when the shades between lines don’t correspond. The finish is more skin-like/radiant when compared to the matte one—like a more full-coverage version of the skin tint. However, I still prefer the matte one personally because it has less transfer. Maybe I could’ve set it more, but I feel like too much powder makes things look more cakey than seamless.

It also really covers my redness without sitting heavy on the skin. Shade 25 is a great match for my fair neutral skin that leans a little warm. The finish is a natural finish in my opinion. Not super luminous but definitely not matte. I would call it natural or satin. It’s hard to find something with this much coverage that doesn’t make me look older but this fits the bill! So happy I tried this!"

Very nice packaging! I love the glass bottle!  However, it didn’t perform as well in humid conditions. After a few hours, it started to show texture, creased in some areas, and oxidized slightly, with a little orange tint peeking through. And this is with minimal time outside!

However, I think the overall performance was fairly okay. This foundation has medium coverage and can be built up slightly. Things such as scars or hyperpigmentation will still peak through even with a 2nd layer. This product looked glowy but didnt emphasize my texture or dry patches after applying. This product lasted around 3 hours before it began breaking down on my nose. I tend to get a bit oily in my tzone so most dewy foundations have issues worth longevity in those areas. However, even with my Mattifying primers and powders, I noticed the same issue. Overall, this product is best suited towards those with drier skin who do not need much coverage. For my personal needs, I would not say this product worked for me."

A little goes a long way, and that makes my pocket happy! The packaging was a little lack luster, honestly. A basic black and white box but the bottle inside was nice. Heavy and not cheap with an iced look instead of clear bottle. It also featured a pump as to not waste any product either over pouring. Overall a great foundation to add to the rotation."

It covers my blemishes, post pregnancy acne, and all the other hormonal changes that come with having a baby. This foundation doesn't transfer to my baby when I am holding her or burping her. She loves to touch my face and the foundation still looks amazing at the end of the day. I normally want the foundation anywhere from 10 to 12 hours or more depending on when I get to take it off due to tending to the needs of a 4 month old. When I received the foundation I was quite surprised on how much spot on the shade was for me. I am extremely happy I didn't have to mix 2 foundations to get my color. I will definitely buy this again when I run out."

			"review_text": "This newer foundation from Fenty is lovely, and the claims are pretty accurate. You have to take into account the product vs your skin and what you want, if that makes sense. For example, I prefer lighter coverage foundations most days and medium for special occasions, so my reviews are always based on what the product claims to do, I wouldn’t ding this and say “I want a sheer finish but this is too heavy,” when it’s not marketed as sheer. Some other reviews of this product do that sort of review which I think is unfair.   That being said, this foundation does make a claim that I think is just about impossible: it claims to reduce shine while also being hydrating and glowy. I’ve been around a while and have seen a number of products make this claim and I don’t think any have truly accomplished it. I don’t reduce my rating because of that because I think most people realize that is a contradiction but just be aware.  However, I found all other claims technically accurate - I found it medium coverage, natural finish (per Sephora), long wearing, and transfer resistant. The skincare benefits would take time to notice, and I don’t expect a foundation to replace skincare - if you have dry skin, still use your moisturizer. This didn’t dry my skin out or make my dry patches worse but if you have flaky skin it won’t cure that.   For the price, quality, and unmatched shade range, I think this is a fab product! Yes, there may be less expensive options (doubtful as to shade options) but there are certainly more expensive ones that don’t perform as well either."

Additionally, it doesn’t clog my pores, which is essential for maintaining skin health.  Shade 150 matches my skin tone perfectly, blending effortlessly into my complexion. I appreciate how it enhances my natural radiance rather than masking it. Overall, Fenty Natural Luminous Foundation is a fantastic choice for anyone with similar skin concerns. It delivers a luminous look while controlling oil, making it a staple in my makeup routine."

Not on miss Riris watch!!!! This sits so beautifully on the skin it’s hard to tell that you’re even wearing makeup! The coverage? Flawless. The blend? Immaculate. The SHADE RANGE????? REVOLUTIONARY. Fenty has and will continue to be that girl and I am so glad we live in a time where makeup is not only Inclusive to a wide range of skin tones and types, but doesn’t look like clown makeup. I can’t sing the praises of this foundation enough. I like this natural finish much more than the original matte formula, too. 10 🌟"

No foundation these days are really mind blowing anymore but this foundation does actually live up to the hype. Beautiful packaging with traditional Fenty shape and feel. Little to no scent which I like. Fenty always does a phenomenal job with their shade range.. I think everyone could find a shade that works for them. I use Shade 180, a light- medium with neutral undertones. Has a medium + buildable coverage with a luminous/ natural finish. Blends into the skin effortlessly. I have combo/oily skin & this foundation lasts all night without transfer or separating which is important to me. Usually a dewy foundation doesn’t last this well on my skin so impressed!"

It works especially well for oily and combination skin types, though those with dry skin may need to use a hydrating primer.

			"review_text": "I haven’t worn foundation in years (since before I knew what I was doing re: skincare and makeup), so I was hesitant as I’ve been burned by too many products to count. Even my full glam only goes as far as tinted moisturizers, bb creams, and concealer for coverage. As my tan fades and the pale/red complexion returns, I was looking for something with a bit more coverage for some formal events coming up. After moisturizing and shaking the bottle well, I applied the product using two methods. On one side I applied the foundation using a beauty blender (1 pump on the back of hand blended out with a damp sponge). On the other side I applied 1 pump to a dense foundation brush and used a stippling motion to get the foundation on my skin and a soft swiping motion to blend it out. Immediately I noticed that the brush method allowed for better uniform, buildable coverage that was super manageable. At first I was scared by how much coverage I got (felt like a clown), but my skin still felt very hydrated and like I wasn’t wearing a mask. It didn’t crease or seep into my forehead wrinkles either. Despite the coverage being more than I’m used to, the foundation was very light, luminous, and non-drying. Since I haven’t figured out my true skin tone, I may have gotten a SLIGHTLY wrong shade (170 is light w cool pink undertones), but I was able to use a bit of bronzer blush and contour to add a bit more life to the canvas (my face lol). All products layered on top of the foundation so nicely. Overall so much easier to use than I expected. I walked my dog in the hot rain to test the claims it’s sweat-humidity-transfer-proof and I was super impressed."

But the foundation itself fell below my expectations. The coverage is significantly sheerer than advertised. It also took an unusually long time to dry down and set, which I think makes it impractical for everyday use. For those with oily skin, I wouldn't recommend this foundation. Even with a silicone-based primer, it didn't hold up well. I ordered the wrong shade so used it for contouring, but it was so sheer that I was barely able to see it. I am a little disappointed, I expected more. Hopefully this is not everyone else's experience."

First, let me say that the color description that correlates to the picture shown for skin tone matching was spot on.  I don’t think I’ve ever found a foundation that has ever matched so accurately.  The bottle is made of a frosted glass that looks like columns so it won’t slip out of your hands when you hold it.  The pump feature dispenses just the right amount of makeup to cover each quadrant of your face.  The consistency of the product is very light and isn’t cakey.

After wearing it for six hours, my skin still looked radiant and fresh, without any oxidation—unlike other foundations I've tried. The coverage is medium to light and very lightweight.   What I love most is its versatility. You can easily layer it with other products for a customized finish, making it perfect for any look. If you're aiming for that natural skin effect, this is a must-have in your makeup routine. Just keep in mind, if you prefer a matte finish, this isn’t the one for you. But for anyone seeking that beautiful, luminous glow, I highly recommend adding this to your daily rotation! It’s simply fabulous!"

It doesn’t have a scent which I like as well. A little goes a long way so you can use it for a natural look or add more for full on glam.

I love the luminous finish and it’s not extremely glowy, more of a natural brightening glow which looks so beautiful in the sun. The texture of this foundation is very liquidity but you also need to act fast as it dries quickly. I highly advise blending as you put it on your face or else it may be a bit patchy. Coverage is amazing and so is the many shades range. As always, spray with a setting spray for maximum staying power."

I'm a believer that a matte base ages you. It applies well without any notable oxidation and it stayed out for well over 10 hours. I have a habit of resting my chin on my palm at the desk in work, and this did not cause the foundation to slide or transfer, so extra points for that. I have not tested out the waterproof qualities of this foundation, although I had checked before and noticed on my swatch the tell-tale water droplet beading when I ran water over the swatch. It is a tad bit too yellow for me (I'm a neutral-cool olive) but I will be seeing if they have a closer match because I really enjoyed trialing this formula.

I have found that using a brush and slightly less product than I normally use leads to the best amount of coverage without looking cakey or settling into drier areas. I did see issues with caking and settling if I used my fingers as I feel the product just does not blend out well with fingers. With a foundation brush though, this product is absolutely stunning on the skin. It gives a beautiful, luminous glow without looking greasy and gives a nice medium-coverage while looking natural on the skin. The shade match of this foundation is the best I have ever had on any face product and that alone will most likely make me repurchase. Overall, the product can be a bit finicky at first and might also be breaking me out a little bit, but I am highly tempted to make this a staple in my makeup routine."

The finish did not need setting powder and also not super matte or leaving an oily finish, which I loved. The foundation smells really good while applying it, packaging was really nice & the shade range is insanely good. Fenty popped off with this foundation. I have tried Estée Lauder, Mac, & lately I have been buying Rare Beauty buttttt im definitely going to buy this again once I finish it! I really really liked it."

Overall the foundation is lightweight and doesn’t have any strong scent or fragrance which I also like. ￼"

			"review_text": "First of all, the packaging is beautiful and makes this feel like a really luxe product. Foundation comes out of a pump and isn’t too runny. A little bit does seem to go a long way — I went a bit too heavy handed at first. I was afraid it didn’t match my skin tone, but it seems to be a decent match for my neck which means it will likely even out my face to match. It felt really yellow at first because I have a bit of a rosy complexion. So it does seem to be a true neutral shade. Definitely make sure to prime your face before applying this foundation because it did seem to cling a little to my dry spots. Overall, a great foundation! Thank you to Influenster and Fenty Beauty for sending me this foundation in exchange for my honest review."

I would say it’s better for combination skin type like me. I think oily can still use it but depends on how oily. Sweet spot is combination. It did settle on the side lines of my nose but that always happens with most foundations on me so no big deal. Doesn’t feel heavy and not too glowy too. It does oxidize do don’t worry if you are one shade lighter wrong."
