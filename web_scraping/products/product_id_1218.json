			"review_text": "After all of the glowing reviews about this setting spray I thought I'd give it a try. Unfortunately it is not for me. It makes my makeup feel incredibly dry, it doesn't absorb any 'powderyness' if you like to set or bake with powder. Half way through the day my makeup cracks in any areas that my skin moves a lot(under my nose, smile lines, under and around eyes). I haven't tried this with foundation or concealer ONLY, but could see that possibly working better, or being good in really hot, sweaty conditions. The fragrance is a lot for something that you spray on your face which is offputting, and if you open your eyes too soon after spraying it BURNS. This is a big NO for me. Waste of money. And I will forever love my UD All-Nighter."

			"review_text": "'Hairspray for your face' were my first thoughts after seeing the ad, and it really IS like using a hairspray! I started out with the mini size, loved it and then moved up to the standard size which retails at a slightly expensive $32 for 3.4 oz/143ml. This makeup setting spray keeps its promises, it really does last and then some, which is no easy feat when my skin is at its oiliest! Oil aside, even perspiration barely makes a dent on how well my makeup holds up after using this. Obviously I'm not talking major sweating events, but the amount you'd typically see after a 10 minute walk on a warm/humid day. What I don't like however is the fact that the nozzle gets clogged up and stops dispensing. And after a quick search online, it seems I'm not the first person to be experiencing this either. Unfortunately this makes the remaining product unusable, which wouldn't be such an issue if it didn't cost this much to begin with! I didn't have this issue with the mini size, nor the first full size I went through - which lasted me almost exactly a month. It might be restricted to a particular batch, or it might just be luck of the draw. Either way I'm not taking my chances. Not a repurchase for me, at least not until the issue with the nozzle is taken care of.   ~ My Top 5 Beauty must-have list ~  1. Hair Loss Treatment: ‘Divine Herbal’ - Hair Oil  2.

			"review_text": "currently 18 with combo/oily skin (with a particularly oily t-zone with emphasis on the forehead and nose!). PLEASE keep in mind this is a partial review, as i got this without getting a primer or a setting powder of any kind. i give this a 4/5 stars for two reasons.  1. it doesn't feel like extra weight on my face? the fine dispersion makes it feel like there's no extra layer. and if it got on my hair somehow, i didn't notice it feeling crunchy!  2. the mattifying effect, the most important part of this spray, was immediate in my use. even as i used a more dewy foundation (i use the tirtir mask fit red cushion not sold in sephora), the mattifying effect still held up! :)  again, this is only 4/5 because it gave me the effect i expected--BUT i'm not giving it a full chance since i don't have a primer and setting powder to give it a strong structure to build off of for staying power. will be writing an updated review once i have time with a primer and setting powder (both probably being one/size, but we'll see!)"
