It’s not a buildable coverage so my red acne zits definitely show through, in comparison to Estée Lauder’s Futurist Hydra Rescue which is buildable and covers much better.   The shimmer is kinda nice but if you are going outside, it’s too obvious of a sparkle to wear out in public. So I only wear for evenings / indoor outings.   Also, when I just throw it on in the morning for a casual day and don’t use setting spray, it seems to rub off very easily.   Won’t be repurchasing."

In pictures I look fresh, dewy and have the most luminous glow. I use Glow Recipe watermelon glow underneath and then the CC cream on top. Perfect combination. I only need one pump of the cc cream for a very natural, medium coverage. Doesn’t look cakey at all. I use a beauty blender and setting spray combination.

I got this when it was 50% off, so I'm wondering if that's why it was on sale.... it's not supposed to expire until 7/2024, so it's not doing this because it's expired. The formula for the light shade just isn't good. May return it and try it in Fair to see if it's any better. Otherwise, my summer shade is great! I like the coverage and how it looks on the skin.

I wouldn’t consider it full coverage but it’s definitely color correcting, which I love. It doesn’t hide my freckles but it evens out my skin tone and keeps it looking hydrated and fresh. It is illuminating so I wouldn’t recommend it for anyone who has oily skin. This is best suited for someone who’s face is lacking a natural glow and you definitely don’t need much. A little goes a long way. In the summer, it’s my go-to for the beach/pool with no added make up to give me a natural but even skin tone. Makes my skin look flawless. For work days etc I’ll add a light powder contour and blush and I’m good to go. In the winter I add a setting little powder to my routine to tone down the illumination. There was a learning curve with this stuff for me but once I figured it out, I was sold. If it helps, I treat it more like a tinted moisturizer than I do a full coverage foundation. I don’t think this is suited for anyone looking for that full face make up finish. This is more natural. If I have an event that I want to be more done up, I add a drop of my other full coverage foundation, dab together on the back of my hand and apply. I truly love this stuff."

The amount of coverage seems similar to the original version (it's been years since I've tried that one, though) - it's seriously impressive. It makes my skin look amazing. Another downside though is that it has a citrus-y scent. If this had less glitter and less of a scent it would be a HG product for me."

I can truly say that this is a great product, however I’m not sure if I’d ever spend more than $30 on this and considering it retails for $42… idk. I previously have only used low end bb/cc cream so this my first time with a higher end one. Not sure how to feel honestly because I’m not blown away but it is by no means a bad product. I LOVE the finish of it, its slightly glowy and sparkly. However its really thick and doesn’t feel hydrating. It gives a glow but it dries a bit so it feels matte with a wash of sparkle over it if that makes sense. Still gives a lovely finish I just wish it stayed dewy/hydrated.  The reason why I rated this high is because of the amazing skincare benefits. I just figure that if I am wearing makeup I might as well have a high spf and anti aging properties! Also this product smells amazing upon application, like oranges, but at the end of the day when I took it off with a makeup wipe it smelled spoiled. Also the shade fair is described as having a yellow undertone, however it pulls very neutral/grey. Was very disappointed since I have a yellow undertone and was hoping it would be accurate however it does thankfully blend out well enough to match my skin. Theres just so much good about this product but the few bad things prevent me from giving it a full 5. If I ever find something better I won’t repurchase but for the mean time this is my daily product!"

I washed the leggings 3x with stain remover, but still didn't come out. And the carpet stain will not come out either. I tried a little of the make up and liked it. Was just very unsatisfied with the packaging/bottle."

I can say that it does keep my skin from drying out and I feel like the coverage can be full or medium. I use this as an everyday makeup look but I wouldn’t wear it for a night out or if I needed it to last all day as it wears off. It’s a great cc cream besides the glitter lol."

It looked as if I wet my hands and applied the foundation on my face. Also, the color That was recommended to me- light médium- made my yellow undertones look even more yellow (reference: I usually use Clinique’s Superbalanced in 04 cream chamois). In terms of coverage, I would say it’s a medium coverage- definitely buildable- but it just made me look caked up. Plus when adding concealer under my eyes, it made me look so much older than my 28 year old self. This is a no for me."

It is so shiny all over, it's just a bit too much.  Also, my fiancé noticed I had on a shade that was one shade too dark. He could see the color difference and I blended and blended to try and make sure that didn't happen.  I will try this one more time in the matte, and if it doesn't work, I'll stick to BareMinerals Golden Medium power foundation which I have been using for years.

The coverage is heavy enough that I could almost call it a foundation, since it covers up my freckles, which is something that my other CC cream doesn't do (and I like that).  I can't say I care for the color as well, but since I picked based on the pictures provided on the computer and not based on actually going into the stores, I can't fault it for that.  It was a bit orangey on my skin; I got Fair Light and best I can tell, maybe I should have gone for Fair.  However, given that I don't like the smell of it, I probably won't give the Fair a shot.  I'm sure this would work fantastic for someone who is looking for a slightly heavier coverage CC cream with a nice SPF number, who doesn't mind the smell and is either better at blending or doesn't need too much that it needs to be blended much."

Used this on a daily, and with a setting spray it lasted almost the whole day with no touch ups. Personally, it’s a little too glowy at times, (because of my combination skin) and I just dab a bit of the CC cream compact powder and my complexion is all set! A great substitute for foundation.  Another plus point is that upon removal, my skin looked glowy and healthy! Maybe it’s the serum? Whatever it is, I’m loving it.  The only cons is that at first, the consistency feels a little thick, but hey a little goes a long way AND it feels lighter over time."

It is the perfect base for highlighting but isnt the best for coverage. I still think it's worth it if you want to get rid of some redness and uneven skin tone under another foundation or if you have really clear skin and just want to look shimmery. Also I would say that I break out with some foundations but I do not with this one at all."

The flecks are small, but if you don’t like that look I could see why you wouldn’t want it all over your face. Personal preference. I love the wear, finish, and shimmer of this product however the fair shade is too dark for me, I wish they made a lighter shade. (I am a Fitzpatrick 1 with blue eyes and I sunburn immediately.) To combat this I use a little less product, rub it in more, and then use a lighter concealer on my chin, under eye, and forehead to help brighten it up. Will probably continue to sue, despite the not quite perfect shade match. Maybe for summer only."

I tried to half and half this with various moisturizers, which helped the dryness, but for some reason it always looked patchy when doing this. Lastly, the 'fair' is pretty dark.

			"review_text": "Here is the real tea y'all! I ordered the It CC Illuminating cream last month. The coverage is medium, it is buildable.  This is a hydrating foundation with a ton of great skin care ingredients. If you have very oily skin then you may not love this foundation. I do love the formula, but I can't wear this one alone. I have to apply with my foundation brush using only a small amount. (pea sized) After it has absorbed into my skin a bit,  I then use a medium coverage non illuminating foundation over the top. I bounce it in with my beauty blender in order to prevent fully mixing the two foundations together.  The reason I use this method is because I find that the sparkles in the CC illuminating are just too sparkly on my skin. It appears as if I used a light dusting of highlighter powder rather than setting powder if I don't cover it with at least a thin layer of my other liquid foundation.  That being said, once I take the time to work with it a bit it truly does look beautiful. The formula aside from the overwhelming  sparkles is amazing. I just  ordered the regular It CC cream and I have a feeling I am going to love it much more than the illuminating type because it is going to save me time, yet still be the same amazing formula with all the skin loving ingredients. Personally I enjoy a more natural light to medium coverage foundation.  I have dry skin so this hydrating formula is amazing for my skin type. Once I recieve the CC cream without the illumination I plan to use it as my everyday foundation exclusively.  If you are someone who enjoys having the visible dewy sparkly look to your skin,  you will love this foundation. I just wanted to give all the details for this one because I wish I had read a review like this before I made my first It foundation purchase.  I am not going to return the illuminating type, I am just going to save it for use when I want to do a full glam look and add my other foundation over top for a full coverage glow from within glam look."

I loved them both, so I decided to go and buy a bottle for myself. I was going to buy the matte one, but then i came to my mother's house and tried this. I could not believe my eyes. The coverage is amazing, the wear is amazing, it's just truly my holy grail foundation. First off, when I wear it I'm constantly complimented on how glowy I look. I expressed y concern for possibly looking borderline oily, and the people I was with were appalled and said I looked glowy like J-Lo and all begged me to tell them what foundation I was wearing!!! As a girl who has dealt with horrible acne since I was in middle school, I do have a lot of redness and hyperpigmentation. I can apply one thin layer and have such a natural glowy and lightweight look, and then if I'm going to work or somewhere where I want to wear more coverage I'll do half a pump more and apply to my cheeks where the most redness is. I love this foundation, I recommend it to everyone. It lacks all the annoying things that you sometimes have to put up with foundation, like clinging to dry patches which exaggerates mine or wearing off throughout the day. I always thought I'd be a matte type of foundation girl because of how oil my skin would get, but this controls oil so well for me as well. I set with a little bit of the toofaced setting powder and use the butter bronzer from physicians formula which i think is honestly a match made in heaven for this foundation. And then I use nars blush in orgasm. This cc cream changed my life, i use it for every occasion!!"

I found that this did give my face moisture plus a hint of brightening = a dewy-ish finish. That’s definitely a goal I have for my skincare and makeup.

The fair color for the regular IT Cosmetics CC Cream however is fair enough. So you'd think since I tried the regular one and loved it and the color matched my skin perfectly, thatthe same named shade would match my skin for this one. Not the case. This one in fair is slightly darker and more yellow toned. Plus I think it oxidizes and makes my face look at least one shade darker. So I'm pretty disappointed that they couldn't match the shades.  Besides this one issue, I love this product. It makes you look glowy and healthy and has great medium coverage. But if you don't set it, it can transfer... so I usually set it with the Laura Mercier glow powder to keep the glow."

It does streak when you put it on but if you let it ‘settle’ it becomes very matte. Great product for a quick every day face. I do get occasional acne and you do have to use a stronger concealer.

My face was covered in small pimples. The product has shimmery glitter, that’s right, glitter. While it may help you glow, it probably clogs your pores!  The foundation is also very thick feeling and doesn’t let any of your natural glow shine through. I wanted to give this foundation a good 10 days to see if my skin was just reacting weird to something new. Every night when I washed my face, though, my skin had new pimples.

I have combination/dry skin and it works for me, but I also have found that a bit of setting powder (I use Too Faced Peach perfect loose powder or Urban Decays Velvetizer) tones it down from a shine to a lovely, natural “glow”.  I’ve noticed improvement in my skin’s texture as well as less redness and blotchiness and even my pores seem smaller.  In the past, I have tried it all- Born this Way, Lorac, Tarte Amazonian Clay, Bare Minerals, countless drug store brands. My former favorite is Too Faced Peach Perfect Matte.  This blows everything else out of the water! It covers like a full coverage foundation, buffs out for a flawless finish and it SMELLS AMAZING! It’s a clean, slightly sweet scent, but not overpowering. It lasts all day for me, even without a setting spray.  I strongly recommend Your Skin But Better!

This is marketed as full-coverage but I would say more like a light-medium coverage, but I suppose you could build it if you wanted to. One pump applied with fingers works best IMO."

When i went to sephora looking for something that was not drying and had a dewy finish an associate recommended this one because of the added skin benefits in this formula. I like the glow and finish of this product but there are two things that I’m not crazy about. One, there are definite sparkles in this product. Not evident in the bottle or even on application, but after squeezing onto the top of my hand before application i notice a patch or glitter there the rest of the day. Two, this product transfers everywhere. Anytime I touch my face during the day I can expect some product to transfer even after powdering in the morning. It gets all over my glasses, hands, and coat. While I like the overall look these things have become rather annoying and I don’t think I would repurchase."

My skin is on the dry side especially since I use a retinoid so it can occasionally look a little flaky around the nose/mouth but this is a minor complaint, usually fixed with layering a tiny bit of Aquaphor underneath in those areas. Since this is the Illumination CC those complaining about the “glitter” might prefer to try the regular CC, I find it to be just the right amount of shimmer for a natural looking glow. Most of all I appreciate the high SPF without the look and feel of sunscreen, and the fact that it doesn’t break me out even wearing it all day every day."

This settles right into all of my fine lines and emphasized them.  It made my sensitive skin itch.  It does match my skin tone very well and it gives good coverage, so it’s got that going for it; so if you have young skin that just needs a little help in covering redness, this might be for you.  I wouldn’t recommend it to anyone over 40.  I’m so disappointed that I spent so much of my hard-earned cash on this, but I’ve quit trying with this one."

I decided that I was going to splurge and buy it even though I had not researched it beforehand. I like it. I initially put it all over my face like a foundation. But it looked really oily. I decided to try it just on one side of my face to see if there was a difference. I could definitely see the difference but it still set in my pores. Reading the label a little more thoroughly, this product is first made to be a tinted sunblock but the bottle does mention instructions if you prefer to use it as your main foundation. As mentioned, it settled into my pores but all in all, it is not a terrible product and if you want to have some light coverage while hanging outside, this would definitely work."

If dabbed with fingers covers a Little better my dark spots but still not great. My skin is light , has a lot of red acne scars and light brown melasma. It will cover well the acne scars but not the melasma.  The texture is actually really nice and it wears light. Looks natural and  young, I really like that it almost seams like not seeing make up. It has 50 FPS which is great. I think if I have not dark spots, this product will be a 5 starts for me.  I am gonna try the “matte finishing” new product of the brand to see if it offers a better coverage, if not I will definitely stick with this one."

I have found that this works very well for me with a few modifications.  - I am somewhere between fair and light, so I have two and blend them. - The formula is very much full coverage, and can set before it is fully spread. Depending on the season I will cut it about 50 / 50 with a moisturizing primer or a moisturizing sunscreen. I find that with this modification is spreads nicely and easily and gives me the desired medium level of coverage.  With these adjustments, this is a really nice foundation that lasts all day and doesn't crease or accentuate my pores."

Changing how I applied it completely changed my first impression of it. It no longer breaks up around my chin and nose and it doesn't cling to any dry patches within hours as it did when I was using a primer.  This isn't the most long-wearing product, butI find that it fades nicely throughout the day.

Once I got used to using a smaller amount (Literally, a pea-sized amount does my whole face), I have come to love this. I can get heavier coverage if I use a brush, medium if i use my fingers. It has just enough reflective quality that I could easily get away with no undereye concealer. I would take away half a star because the shimmer quality is a tad heavier than I would like, but then I'd probably have to use concealer again! Instead, I am going to purchase the version without it so I can customize as needed.  This is a solid choice for anyone who needs a high SPF and likes variability of coverage. If you are shy about the illumination properties, try their regular version. You can always add some luminizer drops if you want."

I have tried many deluxe make up which often settled in my well earned creases.  I have rosacea (mild) and the other make up didn’t cover the red splotches. So, WTH, I saw the creator of It cosmetics on TV and thought what I have to loose, this product was half the cost of the high end products I have tried.  So after applying a moisurizer , which I have always done, then applied this product.  Results:  I was very pleased with how it covered my many issues, without looking like like a mask of caking makeup.  The product didn’t settle in my creases and my pores looked less noticeable.  What I liked was that it did have a very slight “illumination” which I think helped to disguise my imperfections. The reason I didn’t give it 5 stars, after about 10 hours, I needed to re apply.  Maybe I am expecting too much from a product, but Hay I am an active senior and I still have long days."

Checking the mirror throughout the day I noticed the product gathering around my nose.

A little product goes a long way and it’s pretty hydrating.   Then I hate how it makes my skin kinda feel sticky all day and it has this weird sparkly shiny glow or “illumination” and I hate it. It makes me look older under the eyes and give a yellow cast to my skin. I will be trying a lighter shade to see if that helps but at this time I’m split right down the middle on this one."

			"review_text": "As much as I enjoy exploring and owning most of the IT Cosmetics line...I feel their color range still gets me- since Medium is too dark (tan) on me, when they said it's their most popular- so I returned it in exchanged for the LIGHT and this one has more of a greyish/ashy undertone, but it's lighter. So I've been mixing this CC  with my favorite foundation, just to achieve a better match and undertone! I feel my color match would be the FAIR and MEDIUM mixed together. Since I have light skin, but with a yellow undertone.  Their current LIGHT is not light enough and doesn't even have the right undertone for me, their medium is way too Tan on me, and has TOO much yellow in it.   I only thing I like about this CC  is it's high SPF 50! It does goes on pretty sheer and has more of a medium coverage and a luminous finished, which I like. Since I do not have oily skin at all, so I do like this CC .   THIS IS DEFINITELY NOT FULL-COVERAGE as they claim. Perhaps their formulation has changed over the years, when it used to be full coverage? I don't know, but bring back the original formula then! If i want a full coverage foundation, this would not be the one I would reach for. I usually wear my foundation with this, since I want the SPF. I would still recommend it, because it's a good brand and this CC  can be worn alone if you want a lighter coverage"

The regular is great for a matte foundation, but the shimmer makes my skin glow and no it doesn't look like I snorted a pile of craft glitter :) The added benefits this product provides  makes it GREAT for every day. I will probably end up getting a more full cover foundation for special occasions and nights out on the town though. The illumination helps the skin to look radiant and young."

It makes me skin look soo smooth, gives me good coverage, the illumination makes my skin look like it has some life again. Its just amazing and with all the good ingredients I can actually feel good about putting this on my skin. I do have a couple disappointments though..  1. The shades.... I wish there was more. I use fair and I have to mix it with a white mixer for it to be light enough for me because fair is super orange... 2. This doesnt cover pimples. This isnt full coverage.

I feel like in direct sunlight you may look like a disco ball wearing this. I exchanged it for the original It CC cream and could not be happier with that product.
