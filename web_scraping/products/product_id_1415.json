I like the top coat too. The face masks are great, those alone would be the price of the whole calendar . The tweezers are very good quality and I was surprised to get such a great item. The under eye de-puffer is amazing I’m happy I received it. The silver hair scrunchy is super cute and the lip gloss is a nice soft shade of red. I love this calendar this year!!! Thank you Sephora you never disappoint. too."

I would say the nly things I did not like would be the hair scrunci, eye roller and lip marker. The tweezers did fall through so I had to look hard for those.

Majority of this advent calendar looks like someone shopped through the travel section at target. The skincare products are the equivalent of a free sample size you’d receive with a regular purchase from a makeup store. The package was also made really poorly. About 5 days worth of items appeared to be missing before I realized they fell out of their box and to the bottom. I had to rip apart the box just to find some because they’d wedged between pieces of cardboard.  Sure it’s “only” $50, but I think everyone can agree that $50 is a lot of money in this economy right now. I wouldn’t really recommend buying this for anyone unless they specifically ask for it. Minus the few makeup items, you may as well go to a dollar general and buy the same items."
