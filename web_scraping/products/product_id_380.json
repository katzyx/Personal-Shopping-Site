The knob at the bottom does not push the product up, so once you use the small amount at the top after unwrapping, that is ALL you can use.  How did this product leave the manufacturing facility?  How did Sephora allow it to leave its warehouses?  This is a BASIC quality control - ensuring your product actually works.  I am very put out that I'm having to make a second trip to a Sephora store to return this.  NOTE TO SEPHORA:  ALERT DONNA KARAN THAT THEIR PACKAGING IS GARBAGE!"

It's not an anti-perspirant (hence all the negative comments I think?) -- but the scent is very close/if not the same. Agree with the other comments that it may take getting used to if it's your first non-aluminum deodorant, but for me personally there's no residue and the scent lasts. I'm super particular about what I use -- so comparing it against what I normally get (Malin-Goetz, Salt & Stone)."

My armpits drip sweat wearing this, cause sweat stains on my shirt, and the scent doesn‚Äôt last.  I don‚Äôt even get the normal musty smell wearing this, it just makes a very weird bitter smell. It also breaks/falls apart and falls out the container very easily.  I don‚Äôt recommend buying this version, get the original one instead."

At this point I had been using Salt and Stone which is OK, but this Deorderant is so much better. Yes there are some mixed reviews, but here is the trick, if you have been using aluminum free deorderant for a while, you wont have an issue as it takes a while for the armpits to get used to the almuninum free, sort of like a detox.  If you are switching from regular to aluminum, you need to let the armpits get adapted to the aluminum free. TRUST THE PROCESS. This scent is sooooooooo good. When I had Salt and Stone I had to reapply, with this one, i only apply once and the scent of cashmere just flows in the air through out the day."
