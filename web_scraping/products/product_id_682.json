Skipped the cleanser as it is expensive, subpar ingredients (especially considering the quality ingredients in the rest of the line), and you wash it off."

You can't use it before makeup because it doesnt absorb and you have to wipe it off and the residue is not ideal for makeup application. And I don't see any results.   Much better off using eye patch masks before makeup as you can let the serum absorb.   Im not trying to spend this much money just to wipe it off!"

This lightweight gel type formula does indeed hydrate, plump up and smooths out my 41 year old under-eyes. At $68 for 30mL of product, yes the Equilibrium Instant Plumping Eye Mask is on the expensive side but a little goes a long ways and it also does double duty as an excellent under-eye primer. You will get MANY uses out of this tube since you only need to apply a super thin layer on cleansed skin.  I can use it as: before bed as Overnight Eye Mask in the morning as Eye Cream and a wonderful Under-eye Primer  I love how it helps depuff and wakes up my morning eyes. It also creates a great primer base for my no makeup makeup looks — color corrector, concealer and/or foundation stays put smoothly around my eyes."

I like that I am waking up in the morning with a more hydrated under eye area. Overall I do enjoy this product, I haven't seen significant changes on my skin (I do have dark circles, puffiness sometimes and fine lines), maybe because I haven't been using this product for long. I am planning to use it for a longer period of time and see it at its full potential. Price point a bit high."

It’s a thick gel like texture and I use a dot size amount on each eye and it does hydrate and plump the skin under the eye and it looks so shiny and glossy but do you need it, NO. I have been using it with or without makeup, when I apply it during the daytime before my sunscreen I love it because it’s not so shiny looking, at night I don’t mind it, under makeup I don’t really see a difference other than a hydrated under eye. I normally apply the product then a while later I dab it into my under eye."

I will say that because this is called a plumping eye mask, I was expecting it to have more of a plumping effect. With that being said, I was able to notice a brighter under eye when I used this product. It just helps you to look a little more awake. I will say that this product makes your morning skincare routine significantly longer because you need an extra 15 minutes for this eye mask. If you have the time to spare, this may work for you. I did see some results, but it wasn’t drastic. Out of convenience, I still might reach for my eye patches over these. This is quite a pricey product, but you do get quite a generous amount of product for what you’re paying."

It moisturized my eyes well but that’s about all it did. I saw minimal plumping and no fading to the discoloration around my eyes.  I would only recommend this as a night moisturizer for the eyes and don’t expect spectacular results."
