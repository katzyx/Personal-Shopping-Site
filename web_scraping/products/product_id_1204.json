			"review_text": "This product is life changing. I mean it, I will be saving around 5 hours a week having to re blow dry my hair because of this product. I have thick, curly (3c/4a), coarse hair that I blow dry straight weekly. My entire life, I have NEVER found any product that can make a visible difference in my hair. No shampoo, hair conditioner, leave in, hair oil, nothing lol. I blow dry my hair weekly and I've found that I have to do retouches daily with my straightener because my hair will get super frizzy 10 minutes after blow drying it and I literally have to redo it all the next morning. And it still never looks good - puffy, dry ends. This product fixes all of that. If you're a girl with curly hair, you know just how surreal that is. It's pretty much something that I had given up on treating, thinking that it's just the way my hair is. But NO! This product not only cuts the drying time, it gives you the smoothest most glorious and silky hair you will ever have. I saw an IMMEDIATE result and still cannot believe how amazing this product is. My hairdresser has never been able to make my hair looks this good either. This is already the best purchase I have made in 2024."

I like it as a last product after I use my leave in creams but before hair serum/oil. This product also is great for days in between wash days to give it that “freshen up” look.

I was worried this would be a waste of money and nothing more than another brand name product with great marketing. But I was so wrong and have never been happier about it. I have thick, wavy, long hair that has been used and abused from years of changing my hair colour and heat styling. For most of my life I was only able to grow my hair to a certain length. Just over a year ago I started using this product regularly throughout the week (~2-4 times a week) and for the first time, my hair has grown past its typical length. I cannot say for sure this is due to this product alone and it’s also possible my experience is unique to me. But I can say that I have not changed any other variable in my hair routine nor have I reduced the amount of heat damage I inflict on my hair. All in all, I 100% recommend this product if you’re on the fence about it. I just ordered my third bottle and praying this stuff sticks around for as long as my hair does."

The virgin hair was super oily and the blonde ends were dry and frizzy. I feel like this helped make my ends feel more like my roots, if that makes sense. It’s all so soft and manageable now. Just a tip- I used the Mizani pre wash scalp oil as well to keep my hair from getting greasy the day after wash day and that’s helped so much as well. My new fav hair products are the scalp oil from Mizani and Olaplex # 3,6,7."
