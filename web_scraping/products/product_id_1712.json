	"ingredients": "Alcohol, Parfum/Fragrance, Aqua/Water/Eau, Benzyl Salicylate, Benzyl Alcohol, Linalool, Hydroxycitronellal, Limonene, Ethylhexyl Salicylate, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Coumarin, Citronellol, Methyl Anthranilate, Citral, Benzyl Benzoate, Geraniol, Ci 19140/Yellow 5.",
	"how_to_use": "Suggested Usage:.-Fragrance is intensified by the warmth of your own body. Apply in the creases of your knees and elbows for a longer-lasting, stronger scent.&nbsp;.-After applying, avoid rubbing or dabbing skin. This breaks down the fragrance, causing it to wear off more quickly.&nbsp;.-If you prefer placing fragrance on your wrists, be sure to reapply after frequent handwashing, as this tends to rinse off the scent.&nbsp;.-Replace fragrance after 12 months. Expired perfumes more than a year old lose the integrity of the original scent... Eau de Toilette or Eau de Parfum?: .The difference lies in the volume of perfume oil. While EDT contains five to nine percent, EDP contains more, usually eight to 14 percent. EDPs, therefore, last longer and smell more intense.",

Its more spicy and tropical than regular flower bomb, I have every single flower bomb fragrance and this is my number 1 right now, well right after Bloom but seasonally this is def a great summer scent. It lasts long I took a 10 hour flight and came out still strongly smelling of it. If you're going to get it get the 98ml because I bought the 50ml not realising the bottle was that small. I thought it was 30ml when I opened the box because this bottle is smaller than the others. Worth getting the bigger bottle. You won't regret it especially if you like Flowerbomb. This scent isn't gourmand like Nectar or BonBon but definitely gives holiday in Hawaii or somewhere with salty seas. perfect for day or night time. Get it!"

Definitely love the amber color in reference to the Tiger Lily as well as the mirrored label. So beautiful!"

I do think maybe people would enjoy this if they're a huge fan of tropical sunscreens and live in hot whether year-round, but I do live in Canada, so for the price I would prefer a perfume that I would wear all the time. It sort of smells like Beach Walk by Maison Margiela, very beachy! So, if you enjoy coconut, musky, warm, sunscreen scents, then yes! I would reccommend this. If you're looking for a year-round scent, maybe pass!"

There's something light and airy about it though it's strong it's not overpowering. It's quite comforting actually. Warm, kinda beachy, sunny, relaxed, feminine, milky. If you love Tiger lillies like me you have to try it. The bottle os a gorgeous tiger lilly orange.  I'm saving up for a full size."

I prefer perfumes like Vanille Insensee by Atelier, Madagascar Vanilla by NEST or Coffee Break by Margiela. This is something I‚Äôd chase someone down the street to get the name of despite it being less ‚Äònatural‚Äô than the usual scent profile I go for. Very girly. I will be purchasing the largest bottle shortly."

At five minute I get mostly flowers, just a hint of coconut and mango (which fade quickly). At an hour it's floral and quite powdery. After that, the powder starts fading and it's got more of a savory-sweet note, presumably the benzoin; it's quite vanillic throughout.  It doesn't really remind me of Flowerbomb, which for me is a good thing. However, I also don't get much fruit, which is sad. I wish I was getting the mango others can detect. This is one of my better-liked tries, but I wish it were less powdery and more fruity."

The mango is completely lost on me, even after dry down, and I find that the initial coconut milk burst dissipates quickly.  I'd consider this an ambery floral with more of a warm gourmand bent than an actual floral.  Flowerbomb Tiger Lily has staying power on my skin and, overall, I think I'll continue to enjoy this fragrance for evening wear as it's just a bit too heavy for the workplace, in my opinion."

The packaging from the box to the bottle is absolutely exquisite leaving no detail untouched. The bottle being almost in the shape of a diamond, of course a girls best friend, is absolutely beautiful along with the deep amber color of the bottle it's the perfect combination. As for the smell of it, well let's just say l'm not usually a floral kind of girl, but this one has me in a chokehold, the notes of the coconut milk and mango along with the invigorating scent of the tiger lily is absolutely captivating. I will say at first the perfume is a little strong, but nothing that will cause a headache just be sure to only spray 1-2 sprays max. The perfume is one that lasts and stays on the skin for hours, leaving behind a sexy charismatic bold trace for hours after initial application! Overall I absolutely love this perfume and would recommend to anyone!"

It's a more mature scent than what I reach for. I usually like a very light and clean scent and there's a lot more depth to this - one very small spritz is the sweet spot. When I first started off testing this I did two sprays and holy cow it gave me a massive headache. The scent definitely lasts all day - great thing when you use the right amount and when the scent is desirable. Very bad if you use too much or the smell is unpleasant. Overall this scent is warm and reminiscent of summertime...but much more mature than your simple vanilla/flower/ coconut vacation type thing in my opinion. It took me some getting used to, and I can't use much but it has definitely grown on me."

The top notes of bergamot and coconut stay strong through the dry down. The tiger lily, jasmine and freesia are bright and make this a fruity floral scent that is fun to wear. I don't get a lot of the benzoin as a base not but that doesn't really matter. For fun, lused Jo Malone Dark Amber & Tiger Lily dry oil as a base with the V&R sprayed over. It was perfect! This would be great over a dark vanilla too."

A technique that is predicted to soon become a lost art due to synthetic chemicals being used as a replacement for Benzoin. So fascinating! This perfume is a must-have!

It smells like you are sitting next to a fresh boquet of lillies! It is a very light, not heavy scent. There is an ever-so-slight spicy note to it. It isn't strong itxs just something slight I noticed. I have gotten so many compliments in this scent by friends, family members, and even complete strangers.

It's extremely sweet and tropical without feeling like it's only appropriate for a summer vacation, the floral notes are very grounding. This will get a lot of rotation from me for all of spring, summer, and into fall, for sure. The strongest note to me is the coconut, my sister who hates coconut scents didn't like this at all. Luckily, I LOVE coconut scents and would recommend this to anyone else who loves coconut. The longevity on this is phenomenal, you could get away with using one spray of this and still be able to smell it several hours later. Even though it's got strong lasting power it doesn't come across as heavy or abrasive."

I am very familiar with Viktor&Rolf scented perfum sprays, and I wasn‚Äôt very keen on the original Flower Bomb, but did like others such as Flowerbomb Dew and Good Fortune. This one, compared to those, is more bold and daring. Where as I would typically use the other scents for light occasions or targeted weather, I use this one daily, whether it‚Äôs for an occasion or a lack of. The scent starts off with the sweet and delicious Coconut Milk scent that (for a top layer) lasts surprisingly long. It then opens to the bold Tiger Lilly scent, which is beautiful mixed with the lingering coconut milk. Again, this middle note lasts a very long time and eventually takes over the coconut milk smell. Once the Coconut milk scent has vanished, out comes the fruity goodness of the Mango. It‚Äôs truly amazing how it goes from being coconut milk and Tiger Lilly to Tiger Lilly and Mango, but it does, and leaves an amazing impression. These two scents together make a powerful lasting scent that just makes you want to continuously smell any and every thing. I‚Äôve had so many compliments while wearing this, it‚Äôs unreal. This Parfum spray keeps you on your toes and leaves a lasting impression of bold elegance that just cannot be beaten! I highly recommend this for all occasions!"

As the scent evolves, the exotic tiger lily accord takes center stage, infusing the perfume with a wild and captivating essence. The juicy mango accord adds a layer of tropical sensuality, perfectly balanced by the warm and comforting benzoin base.  The bottle itself is a work of art ‚Äì luxurious, stylish, and an eye-catching addition to my perfume tray. Its design reflects the essence of the fragrance within, capturing the essence of a summer oasis in every detail.

It‚Äôs the perfect companion for those who seek to immerse themselves in the beauty of nature, wherever they may be."

However, it prominently features tiger lilly, which may not be appealing to everyone, including my husband, who dislikes this note, especially in the dry down. The fragrance has a fairly average sillage and decent longevity, with scents that evolve at different points.  While the Tiger Lilly Flowerbomb deviates from the traditional Flowerbomb DNA, if you enjoy summertime warm scents, this perfume might be a great fit for you, offering a unique and captivating scent experience."

It‚Äôs like they‚Äôve managed to capture the luxurious vibe of an expensive tropical holiday and packed it into a bottle, and I‚Äôm here for it.  The standout for me has got to be the rich coconut note. It‚Äôs bold, it‚Äôs there, and it‚Äôs unapologetically the star of the show. But here‚Äôs the kicker ‚Äì it doesn‚Äôt come off as cheap or overpowering. Or smell like sunscreen. It‚Äôs unusual in the best way, hitting that sweet spot between being distinct and sophisticated.

The bottle as always, is also beautiful and feels high quality. My big issue with this perfume is that there's no longevity in the scent, which is odd because I do think the other Flowerbomb variations have a long staying power. I spray this perfume in the morning and the scent is gone within an hour or two. Other Flowerbombs I can still smell by the end of the workday.

			"review_text": "As someone who‚Äôs always on the hunt for stunning perfumes and is somewhat of a connoisseur for specific scents, you can imagine my excitement when Influenster and Viktor & Rolf sent me this to try in exchange for an honest review.  As someone who has a particular nose for mainly aromatic and amber-based perfumes (because they are my favorites), I first checked the notes on this to see whether I‚Äôd like it or not. For reference, my favorite perfumes are from Jo Malone line (Wood Sage & Sea Salt), Guerlain (Mon Guerlain), and Clean Fragrance (Nude Santal & Heliotrope which has unfortunately been discontinued).   This perfume has top notes of coconut milk, bergamot, followed by Tiger Lily, Jasmine, Freesia as middle notes, and followed with base notes of mango and benzoin. Immediately, I thought this would be floral heavy (something I actually am not a huge fan of tbh) so I was a little indifferent to this, not going to lie.   Upon receiving it, I sprayed about 3-4 sprays on my wrist to test this. I first definitely smelled coconut and bergamot, two fragrance notes I actually like. About 15 minutes in, I smelled the mango and benzoin.   Personally, I‚Äôm not a huge fan of benzoin as it can translate weirdly depending on your skin. This however, smelled gorgeous on my skin. I did find it a bit overpowering though, which is why this isn‚Äôt exactly my favorite. Overpowering scented perfumes sometimes trigger a headache for me, and this one, unfortunately did that a little for me.   I tested this for a day, and after 8 hours of wear, the smell was still lingering. I would say I love the smell at 3-4 hours post spray as it‚Äôs not as overpowering as initial spray. I will say this is a VERY nice spring to summer perfume. I will be wearing this when special occasions call for it."

The scent would lighten up in just a few minutes and be just a light scent. It is a wonderful spring and summer scent in my opinion. The scent would last for hours but it would weaken and disappear. It would not last all day. The scent could have stood to have been a little stronger and I wish it would have lasted for a longer time period, these are the only two improvements I found.

Feels like a nice warm summer scent. It's not generally what I go for, but overall is nice. Scent notes include Coconut Milk Accord, Tiger Lily Accord, Mango Accord, Benzoin. It comes in the classic diamond grenade Flowerbomb shape. The cap clicks on and feels relatively secure. The spray nozzle feels standard. I found it lasts 6-8 hours in my skin. Overall it's nice if you like warm summer scents. I wouldn't mind using this up."

Nevertheless, I do not get why they call this line Flowerbomb. I never find them to be very floral, and I'm a fan of floral scents, so it's kind of disappointing in that respect."

The color of the perfume and bottle are absolutely gorgeous, just like the Tiger Lily flower.  With the very recognizable ‚Äúgrenade shaped‚Äù bottle, Viktor&Rolf Flowerbomb is known for, this orange/amber-ish color is stunning. I‚Äôve always collected really pretty perfume bottles, and this is another keeper! The key notes of this perfume are Coconut Milk, Tiger Lily, and Mango. This scent instantly transforms me and my space. Instantly I smell, and feel like I‚Äôm in a tropical oasis. When I initially applied it to my skin, I couldn‚Äôt stop smelling myself. My olfactory system was bursting with excitement! It smells so beautifully feminine and sensual. I couldn‚Äôt wait to have my husband smell it on me. The sensual, tropical scent is long lasting and is just as powerful later in the day, as when I initially applied it. I liked that I don‚Äôt have to reapply it all day long. This means that I will have a lot more of this perfume, a lot longer.   My husband loved this scent on me. He said it went well with my body‚Äôs chemistry. That‚Äôs all I‚Äôll say on that. I would definitely purchase the Viktor&Rolf Flowerbomb Tiger Lily perfume in the future, and certainly recommend every women to own a bottle."

I am a little disappointed that I don't get more coconut. I understand that it's only coconut milk in the notes, but I was hoping to get a nice meaty fleshy coconut vibe or almost like a mango coconut sunscreen but on my skin the coconut is very faint. This fragrance is exotic, bold, energetic, sensual, and bright. It lasted several hours on my clothing and about an hour or two on my skin. I cannot wait until the weather gets a little bit warmer to see how this fragrance develops in heat. I have a feeling it is going to shine and become much better in warmer weather"

But as it settles, it has a creaminess to it.... akin to what I pick up in Ariana Grande's Cloud fragrance. This creaminess is where the fragrance loses me- I'm not a huge fan- it's why I don't like Cloud. This fragrance lasts most of the day, like the other Viktor and Rolf perfumes, but as I mentioned, it does evolve into that creamier scent. The bottle and color of the glass are stunning and look beautiful on display.   This isn't a pass for me just yet. I don't hate it, and I do think that there are a ton of people who will LOVE it.  Sometimes, fragrance takes a minute to grow on me and something I thought I didn't like becomes a favorite.... with how I feel right now, I wouldn't be surprised if that happened.

This complements the flowerbomb line perfectly. As beautiful as it smells, in my opinion it was slightly difficult to pinpoint exactly what notes it displays at first. However, I definately notice tropical and fruity notes such as coconut. It definitely has some beachy, summer notes to it.  Although the name is Tiger Lily I feel that it smells a lot like Asiatic lilies. I have a couple of those in my garden and it reminds me of that scent. I also detect notes of amber.  I really love it. I feel that it lasts throughout the entire day. I usually spray on my wrist,front of neck and back of my neck. I don't think it's overpowering using it this way. A little goes a long way as is the case with the other Viktor and Rolf perfumes I have tried. I absolutely recommend giving this a try. It's perfect in my opinion"

I was skeptical as I‚Äôm not the biggest fan of the flowerbomb collection but this scent is different fro the others. When I first sprayed I was not expecting the scent I got, it had like a floral scent (not that it overpowered) but as it diminishes you get a great scent of fruits, the coconut and mango sips through bringing this fragrance well together. This is. Avery tropical like scent which is perfect for the warmer months. It‚Äôs not a scent for all year long especially if you live in a place like myself (which has all distinct seasons). What I liked the most is that this is a unique flowerbomb scent and so far the best scent of the Viktor&Rolf flowerbomb collection. This is a warm, creamy, bold, sexy scent that suits all ages.  It‚Äôs long lasting and well made (in my opinion the best made from the flowerbomb). It can be a great gift for person of any age. This scent can suit a person on their 20s as well as those in their 40s or older. Again it is a scent that I wouldn‚Äôt use during the winter but perfect for warm weather. I gave it a four stars only because I‚Äôm unable to use it all year round but if you live in a warm state this would be amazing to use all year round."
