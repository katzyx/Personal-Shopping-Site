			"review_text": "This bronzer feels fresh and light on the skin. There is some shimmer, but I don’t find it to look “glittery”. How and how much product you’ll use will depend on your skin tone, depth, and desired result. In the fall and winter, my skin is light with mostly neutral undertones. I have to use this with a very light touch. I use less than a pea size amount and mix it with my foundation and a bit of moisturizer. This adds a subtle glow and just enough color to add some life to my skin. I then use a bit less than a pea sized amount and tap on my cheeks. I have to be really careful not to use more than the bare minimum so it doesn’t look orange rather than sun kissed. I wish this came in more shades because this color is difficult to work with on fair to light/medium-ish skin. The light formula feels nice, and it hasn’t caused any irritation or breakouts. I also love mixing a little with my body lotion if I’m wearing a top that exposes my chest or arms."

If you have a deeper skin tone I could see this working as a highlight but not a bronzer. I felt the product looked the best when it wasn’t set with powder. I felt like the powder took a lot of the pigment away and made it less noticeable that I was wearing bronzer. If the product wasn’t set it maintained a more rich pigment and you had the glowy bronze effect still in tack! This product in my experience is long lasting (10-12 hours).

One pump is all you need to cover your face. I like to use this after spf as a first bronzing base underpainting step. It gives my face a nice warmth and glow, without being too orangey (Based on swatching on my hand, i thought it would be but it’s really not)! I then go in and spot conceal where i need to and tone down any parts that look too bronzed (I’m very pale naturally). It plays well with my makeup and feels like skincare. I am a big fan of this product and caliray!"

There are so many versatile ways to use this product, and I'm obsessed with each one.   As a contour, it gives me a beautifully natural look. On days when I'm only wearing blush, I add a little bit of this serum to contour my face, and it leaves me looking radiant and glowing. For that perfect sun-kissed glow, I mix it with my moisturizer and apply it all over my face. The result? An incredible, luminous complexion that I can't get enough of.  What's even better is that it has amazing skin benefits! Packed with peptides, it not only enhances my makeup but also improves my skin's health. The added hyaluronic acid provides excellent hydration, making it a must-have in my beauty routine.   I love using it as a quick contour when I'm not wearing foundation—just blush and this bronzer for a fresh, vibrant look. It's perfect for my on-the-go lifestyle, offering a quick pop of color and vibrance.   I can't recommend the Caliray SunDrip Skin Boosting Peptide Serum Bronzer enough. It has transformed my makeup routine, especially since I prefer a natural look. It's a game-changer, and I am absolutely in love with it!"

In fact, liquid bronzer can counterintuitively look worse on my skin tone than powder (I think because it might be harder to control?)  I went into this product unsure what to expect, but excited for the non-shimmer claims most of all. It is surprising initially: it looks like it will have subtle shimmer. But exactly as they promise, once you blend it into the skin, it looks natural and radiant vs shimmery.  I also wanted to talk about using this on the forehead/hairline as I am someone with not only fair skin, but blonde hair as well (see why i'm so cautious with bronzer lol). I am SO happy to report that this is not getting into my hair and looking off! What I've been doing is using merely 1/2 pump (pressing lightly) and dotting that all over my forehead/cheekbones. Then I spread it upwards into my hairline. I think that because the texture feels more like a skincare product than a liquid bronzer, that may help to explain why it's not messy/sticky/heavy to use.  Finally, I feel this is an incredible value for what you get. The bottle is an entire ounce, and given that 1/2 pump is giving this natural, sunkissed look, I think the product will last quite a while!"

I used my fingers to apply and it spread out perfectly. It’s sort of has a slight shimmer to it which adds the perfect amount of glow. Love the thin and sheerness to it so that way you can apply and build up. Perfect to warm up your face and give you a super bronzey look. It’s also a plus that it has skincare built into it as well to hydrate."

Then came Sundrip’s peptide serum bronzer. When I tell you this stuff is WEIGHTLESS! I mixed half a pump with my moisturizer and I can’t tell any difference between just my moisturizer and them mixed together. It’s so lightweight! The color is also sheer and buildable, so as the skin on my body darkens, I’ll be able to better match it with more pumps of the bronzing serum. It does have a bit of sheen, but that helps give a natural, dewey look. I prefer a natural look to my makeup and adding this serum in helps me achieve that without having to do a full face of makeup. The packaging is also really nice, it comes in a glass bottle with a pump and the formula truly is unscented! I really love this bronzing serum so much and have my next bottle waiting in my cart already!"
