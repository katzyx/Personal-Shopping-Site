The lip oil doesn‚Äôt leak which I‚Äôve noticed on different lipgloss/oils, stays on the lip for a long period of time smells true to the label and has a flat color to it. The application is simple. The applicator itself is soft on the lips. The formula definitely works how it says it both hydrates and repairs however it is a little sticky in the end. I think it‚Äôs definitely worth buying, especially"

The applicator is the oversized, soft kind that I really like.   Other than that, I‚Äôve used lip oils that were more hydrating and that have lasted longer. These don‚Äôt have any tint either. Not really noticeable at all, other than having a fun, fruity smell.   I‚Äôm ok with the price I paid for these, since they were on sale and I applied a further discount with the code available for fenty that far. But I wouldn‚Äôt purchase them again."
