It makes my lashes look amazing, and I NEVER have to worry about it smudging or flaking. I can comfortably wear it for my 10-12hours shifts and not worry about transfer. I wouldn't say its the most voluminizing mascara ever, but it does make my lashes look great. Lengthened and never clumpy. I will routinely use this wand to brush out my lashes after I use another mascara because it just makes them so perfect. I will always have one of these at home."

Not with Buxom! In NYC I am ASTONISHED that some Sephora stores don’t carry this brand in store. It is hands-down, no questions asked the absolute best waterproof mascara on the market. For me, this has lasted ALL DAY on the beach, in pools, on hikes, skiing, surfing, running a marathon, and sadly at funeral services. Yes really, not even a flake or the slightest mascara run. Dior Show and other top brands ran immediately just from contact lens rewetting drops.   I do have naturally long eyelashes and this mascara makes them bigger and bolder. Much of it has to do with the shape of the wand. I just love it and this is a permanent staple in my makeup bag. If this is ever discontinued I know I’ll never find another mascara as good as this because I’ve literally tried them all, even the drug store brands. You can’t go wrong with this.

Are. In. EVERY. mascara. known. to. Womankind!!! You know what I can use? Candilla wax, beeswax... that's about it. This is the only, the ONLY, mascara that I can put near my eyes. Every other brand puts known irritants in their formulations. Even the all natural ones use carnauba, which wrecks absolute havoc on my eyes. (Kosas, you would be perfect, but alas, you use cheap carnauba wax over candilla wax.) Omitting beeswax is I guess vegan, but when it's one of two waxes my eyes can handle? The cosmetic industry needs a serious overhaul.  Maybe one day I'll create my own mascara, but until then, this is all I can wear, and it's beautiful, clump-free, and waterproof! Oh my god, does it stay put! But at the end of the day, my Garnier micellar water takes it right off.  I would be lost without this. Please, Buxom, NEVER get rid of this formula. This isn't just my Holy Grail, it's my Only Grail. I love you, Buxom, for making a mascara for allergy-prone, sensitive eye girls like me. I would have given up on makeup a long time ago without you."

As i said i don’t like to have no mascara on and this has been my go to for vacation as i can’t stand staying on the beach or not getting under water as i’m an active person.  I do layer this on to get thick volume as i do with the non waterproof Buxom as well.  I find that this is the only waterproof mascara that goes on as well as the non waterproof version (they usually get cakey and dry quickly) With this one you can “add layers after layers”, as many as you want depending on the look you desire.  It doesn’t clump or dry to a crisp.  Also another + is that the texture and workability of the formula doesn’t change (no thickening or drying) after weeks of usage day after day, so it feels like new even after a few weeks you have been using it.  I wanted to weite a review because i have tested this on several scuba diving / snorkeling trips and it’s absolutly amazing!  As for the removal, after an entire day swimming in the sea, i can use only baby shampoo to remove it in the shower. If i have not been in the sea, a waterproof remover is necessary."

The formula definitely changed and it is no longer what it used to be...the effect is drastically different and whatever changed needs to be changed back ASAP. This mascara no longer lifts, volumnizes, or lengthen. It used to be my holy grail mascara...giving my straight eyelashes the ability to look long, fluffy, and most importantly natural. People used to ask me if I had gotten extensions when I use this product...now the formula actually straightens my eyelashes even after I curl them and it no longer gives it that fluffy, natural, voluminous look.

The formula was great for about 2 weeks, ok for another 1 or 2, and now it's so dry. I'm really bummed about that. I can't afford a $24 mascara once a month, nor do I feel I should have to. Love the brush, love the formula initially, but not happy with the longevity. It is currently sitting in my cart for repurchase but I'm not convinced I will which I'm bummed about :("

I love how smoothly this goes on my lashes and how smoothly the brush comes out of the tube without pulling out all kinds of chunks that need to come off! You'd think that all mascaras are easy to use, but sometimes the shape of the brush isn't right and I can't seem to catch the lashes correctly, but this hour-glass shaped brush seams to do the trick for me. Initially you might think that this goes on a little thin (which I love!), but it is build able to create some volume too. Lately I've been experimenting with a lot of makeup and skin care products at Sephora, but I think I'm done in the mascara department. I will be using and re-buying this until they stop producing it."

They're little brush-away flakes, anyway, not the chunky smudges-on-your-face kind. Applying setting spray helps.  Best Feature: the wand! Comes out of the tube with a small (not too small) amount of product that allows you to build up coat-by-coat. I recently tried the Too Faced and Tarte waterproof formulas and they both failed big-time on this - way too much product. This mascara doesn't give me clumpy/spidery lashes. You can build drama in a way that still looks feathery and light, like false lashes. I'm usually averse to plastic bristles but this really does fan out the lashes well and does not poke the eye.  This mascara holds a curl on my extremely curl-resistant lashes. The formula isn't too wet or too dry. I really hate wet formulas that smudge and stick the lashes together before they dry - this is not at all like that.  Not too bad to take off compared to some waterproof - I find coconut oil and warm water work well! I definitely recommend!"

My lashes look natural and feathery and babydoll-like. Lower lash smudge is minimal to none, and I don't have to fight the mascara when I remove it at the end of the day. However, my only critique is that for a waterproof mascara, it does not dry as quickly like other waterproof mascara. I have straight, thick lashes that can't hold a curl for the life of me. So it's pertinent that I have a mascara that dries quickly to hold my curl, and those usually are waterproof mascara. Tip: swipe the thinnest first coat after curling, wait to dry, then layer more for optimal curly, feathery satisfaction."

I have pin straight lashes that are a decent length (I guess I would say mid-length) and when I curl them, they stand out and look great but the problem is that once I apply mascara, they fall flat again. Waterproof mascaras help but they're usually damaging to lashes during removal; this is NOT the case with this mascara! It's waterproof to an extent, but very easy to remove. The brush defines and separates my lashes for great length and surprisingly, good volume. This product is priced just right, in my opinion. I've been using it for about a week and I could not find any flaws - I love this mascara. I am even able to go over this with another mascara that's meant to build volume without any clumping.

The consistency is the same as the original, in between a mousse and liquid. If you like dry mascaras, this is definitely for you. It's not clumpy and coats my short, thin, Asian eyelashes very nicely.  There's definitely more volume, but not length, after applying this mascara. I'm okay with this because the mascara doesn't claim to have lengthening powers. They separate pretty nicely, but historically I only like to put on one coat of mascara. I also have not tried it with curled lashes, so I apologize I cannot attest to the curl staying power.  What I am most impressed by is how waterproof this is! I wore this to the gym, only mascara, no eyeliner, foundation, primer, etc. After an hour and a half of intense cardio workouts, weight lifting, and cross-training, it did not budge, flake, or smear at all! I must admit that I sweat A LOT. I honestly have never met anyone, guy or girl, that sweats more than I do, it's pretty gross but weirdly impressive at the same time? My face was streaming and I was consistently wiping my entire face with my workout towel throughout. At the end of my workout, I checked the towel and no transfer!

This stuff doesn't clump, it makes my lashes super long and thick, and it stays put no matter what I do. This of course makes it tougher to remove, but that comes with the territory of waterproof mascaras. The wand is perfect. The formula is great. For the price, it can't be beat."

Also, the mascara dried relatively fast, so my lashes didn't stick to my eyebrows, which was nice.

Only thing is you need a really good cleanser to get it off. The brush separates & defines my lashes in a way that makes me go, WOW! You can layer it for effect, but I find one coat is perfect for day wear."

I liked the Buxom Lash Waterproof because the brush sweeps easily through my lashes and doesn't really clump for the first two coats (although with three or more coats, things get a little more clumpy and spiky than I would like). It's great at lengthening my lashes, although it doesn't provide much in the way of volume. However, the main reason I am not keeping it is that it is not as waterproof or long wearing as I had hoped. I was able to remove some, though not all, of the mascara in the shower without using any cleanser or makeup remover. Additionally, and this is the main thing that bothers me, it flakes pretty easily. After several hours, my cheekbones are covered in little flecks of mascara, and touching my lashes leaves me with black pieces on my fingertips. Because of the flaking, the lengthening effect is diminished by the end of the day. I wish that this provided a little more volume, and most importantly, didn't flake off all day. I'm still hunting for the perfect mascara for me, but this would be alright if you were only looking for length and didn't need it to last all day. Not my favorite, but it wasn't radically disappointing."

The brush is exactly the same and the overall tube design is the same -- minus the LASH under the BUXOM. I think the image posted is of the original Buxom mascara. The waterproof mascara tube has a shinier black finish.  Well, this product is not waterproof. Perhaps it could possibly be considered water-resistant? Not only could this mascara not hold a curl, but I was able to remove fairly easily with cold water.  On the plus side, the formula of this is blacker than the original.  I rarely ever return products because since this product claims to be waterproof but isn't, I will be returning this."
