            "review_text": "Verb Ghost is the best shampoo and conditioner Iu2019ve tried. My hair looks super shiny just by using them without any leave-in conditioners, masks or oils.   They really are a weightless shampoo and conditioner because my hair feels so light and looks full. I have medium density hair and this works like a dream for me. Like whenever I use it, I have way less hair fall, less dandruff, less oiliness and more days I can go without needing to shampoo my hair.   I love how the shampoo doesnu2019t make my hair knotty and squeaky but instead makes it feel silky yet cleansed when washing. This is good because usually shampoos that make my hair feel squeaky clean give me hair loss. I also love how my scalp feels so clean, light, and refreshing afterwards. Iu2019ve never had that feeling with any shampoos before.   Itu2019s a whole spa experience for me honestly. A lot of shampoos are so frustrating to work into my scalp and to rinse off, but not this one. It actually calms my stress with how easy it is to use. You also donu2019t have to use much to get your hair clean, just be sure to double-cleanse.  Iu2019ve only used the sample packs of the shampoo and conditioner but I will be buying the full bottles. But not at Sephora, itu2019s expensive here. I feel like the conditioner bottle should be white and the shampoo bottle should be black, it confuses me."

I have a lot of long fine bleached hair, and this gets my hair clean without stripping or drying.  Regarding the low reviews stating it doesnu2019t lather/ is drying: you need to double shampoo!! First wash I use one pump, spread on both hands, and scrub your scalp. On my second wash I donu2019t even need a full pump it lathers so much. And people tend to not use enough conditioner. I have a lot of hair and its dry, so I use probably around 4 pumps. Conditioner only hydrates and conditions your hair, if you have fine hair or long hair you need to use something for detangling. I use the verb oil and I use the pureology detangling spray. You cant just rely on a single shampoo and conditioner line to take care of your hair needs, especially a clean hair line."

I will continue using the ghost hair oil but unfortunately, the shampoo and conditioner was not it for me."

A safe choice for people that have little to no hair concerns and just want something to get the job done.   There's a light citrus smell that doesn't linger after you leave the shower. Lathers well enough to feel clean but not drying. I don't get this squeaky or straw like feeling I get with other shampoos while washing. There's not too much of a moisture effect that feels like it's being weighed down it also doesn't give me scalp acne.   The thing I liked most was how when my hair finished drying, my scalp didn't feel tight, dry, or itchy. It just felt normal.  I do have to say that there isn't super significant results when it comes to how your hair looks. It just makes my hair feel lighter and balanced. It's just a shampoo anyways but I like it and I'll repurchase another bottle."

I bought the duo along with the healing oil which I use on my scalp and ends before bed the night before a wash and then double wash in the shower and let the conditioner sit. After my double wash tho my hair feels almost stripped of moisture? But once I add the conditioner it re adds the moisture Iu2019ve lost .  What I like about this duo is the way it has brought curls and volume back into my hair once itu2019s dry. I believe this works best with the healing oil and the verb oil as well. My hair is medium thickness and curly/wavy but I straighten it most days and it lasts about 3/4 days at most before I need to wash again.

It didn't leave my hair as dry as some other shampoos do, and the conditioner made them feel smoother without adding more weight, even while still in a shower. These days, I wash my hair a couple of times a week, so I expected that this stay-at-home regiment would help my strands heal. I have fine curly hair that I used to straighten daily with a dryer and sometimes iron until relatively recently. What happened with this set, however, is that I started having dandruff after about a month. I had never had dandruff in my life before! It also seems that I'm losing more hair than I used to. Despite using a decent amount of conditioner, I can barely brush my wet hair. And if I don't brush when it's still wet, I may not be able to brush it at all. This is despite using the Ghost oil (that I generally like) and Moroccan Oil leave-in conditioner for my ends. I was attributing these issues to the general stress and cold weather but as I read negative reviews, I thought of other brands that I liked at the beginning and then started to like less, and it was the opposite problem: they made my hair greasy after two bottles, but at the beginning, they moisturized and conditioned perfectly. I'll give this product three stars and the benefit of the doubt: maybe it works better on other hair types."

Background: I have a lot of hair. It is long and wavy. I did not use hair masks during that time. It is virgin hair and I do not use hot tools on it.  It is a fine shampoo and conditioner. Especially for the price. It will end up being similarly priced to some drugstore shampoos/conditioners. I enjoyed using the shampoo. It was foamy and light. It won't make the hair feel hydrated but it does make it feel clean without stripping it.   Same thing for the conditioner. It is not meant to be very hydrating but at least it helped control frizz. On the other hand, it can make my hair staticky which can be helped with a bit of hair oil.  Overall, both products are fine. The smell is nice, the texture is nice. I don't believe the interesting ingredients add anything to the effects of the product. It is just basic a shampoo and conditioner.  I would rather try the hydrating shampoo/conditioner instead of repurchasing the Ghost line.   PS: It took me so long to finish the products that in the end, the conditioner became 'caked' on the walls of the bottle. Nothing against the product but it is the reality of having less and less product inside the bottle and it drying out overtime."

It leaves my scalp very clean but not stripped at all. I have naturally dry curly hair but it doesn't dry out my hair at all. My hair is also very fine but it doesn't weigh down my hair strands. I like the ingredients too and that it contains protien.   I love the packaging. Very easy to use and looks luxurious. And very happy that it's vegan friendly.  Overall, I'm very satisfied with my purchase. The only reason why I gave it 4 stars is because it's a bit expensive for me and runs out quickly compared to other drugstore shampoos I have used. I love it , don't get me wrong, but I can get the same results from using cheaper shampoos that would last a longer time. I am gonna use a different shampoo after I finish this bottle, but I definitely will repurchase it every now and then."

Verb shampoo seems to be made for fine hair mostly, but my hair did not react badly to it like it did to other shampoos. My hair didn't shed as much, and the foaming was instant when I rubbed some of it onto my hair. The smell was like a shampoo of a very nice hotel (smells good but definitely not overpowering). If you do have dry hair though, I suggest getting a good hydrating conditioner because it does get a bit dry (that's my hair reaction though, might be different for others)."

It is probably better for those who use a lot of hair product (I literally only use straight argan oil). The conditioner seemed nice, however. I really like that a little bit went a long way (as in it was very easy to distribute and cover my hair without waste). But, it just doesn't seem conditioning enough to combat the stripping nature of the shampoo.   I give it 3 stars because it is certainly better than most other shampoo+conditioner duos that I've used, and I'm sure that this shampoo works well for those that use a lot of products that they need to remove in the shower."

I absolutely loved this shampoo, it lathers amazingly well, as a decent sent, and left my hair (which is dry curly and hip length) feeling clean and soft. A little goes a long way with the shampoo, as I mentioned it was a 10ml sample and I have extremely long hair, and I didn't even need to the whole package to cleanse my scalp and hair thoroughly. Considering purchasing the full size with the pump once I finish my current shampoo. 4/5 because I wish it was slightly cheaper price per bottle, as Verb is advertised as being a value brand."

After soaking my hair I started with the Verb Ghost Shampoo, using the whole sample (my hair is just past my shoulders and fine in texture, so it took in a decent amount, a bit over quarter size).  Maybe itu2019s called Ghost because it just disappears! But in a good way! It simply drinks into your hair, lathers and works in completely.  It also rinses out smoothly and cleanly, no build up feeling. My hair is also color treated (permanent red) and at least in my experience, the product was quite kind on it.  My hair is NEVER just shampooed, so I completed the wash with a conditioner (Ghost Conditioner).  Overall I was very, very pleased with my experience! The scent was quite pleasant and left my hair feeling light (not weighed down with product like some brands). I would absolutely give this product a try!"

Even with daily showering, it's not harsh on my hair or color."

This shampoo claims to naturally smooth frizz and promote radiant shine for all hair types. Sunflower seed extract provides natural UV protection while guarding against color fading as quinoa protein strengthens, protects, and encourages hair growth. A hint of grapefruit and oatmeal blend together to leave your hair with a light fresh fragrance, while moringa oil infuses the hair shaft with essential nutrients. This shampoo also lathered nicely and left my hair feeling clean and nourished. My hair was definitely smoother after using this along with its matching conditioner, but unfortunately my hair also felt weighed down and became greasy after just a day. I personally have fine thin straight hair so even though this shampoo claims to be for all hair types, itu2019s just not for me. For these reasons, I wouldnu2019t buy a full size bottle."

I love that it provides UV protection as my hair is very sensitive to sin exposure. Usually if I stay out in the sun alot my hair color will change drastically!

It actually made my hair feel soft without weighing it down.  It lathers nicely and rinses clean without leaving any residue.  Moisturizing Great ingredients   Cons: The scent is not my favorite. It is very lightly scented but the fragrance itself reminds me of dishsoap.  It didn't do much to help combat frizz.  My hair felt like it needed to be washed more often using this shampoo.   Overall, I love that it is moisturizing and super lightweight but the scent was a big drawback. I also didn't like that I felt I had to wash my hair more often than normal."

This shampoo doesn't weigh down my hair at all. My hair feels soft and smooth, especially paired with the conditioner and oil."

My hair is also shedding more, probably because of the tangles. I recently noticed how few split ends I have, but after using this and noticing the weird wispy texture I checked my ends and sure enough there is a plethora of damaged ends.  I WAS growing my hair longu2026 but now Iu2019m going to cut it because of the tangling issue, the weird wispy texture and the sudden onset of split ends. I really regret not just sticking with drugstore shampoo. I have a feeling this shampoo damaged my hair shaft, due to this new weird wispy texture and propensity to tangle. It looks duller, dryer, and less shiny after using verb. When I jog w/ hair in a pony, my pony will stay-- I just went on a jog and my hair just slid right out. It also looks much thinner in a pony now. I miss my old healthy hair :u2019(  Can not recommend for people w/ fine hair (or anyone really). My hair feels like cob webs (yuck). Will be returning."

But if you lather aggressively you well get knots. That even with the VERB conditioner you might still feel. (But I don't have any issues when dry, hair is clean, voluminous and shiny) I recommend lathering gently into the scalp only and rinsing it out to clean your ends and length of your hair. I probably wouldn't recommend this to dry and damaged hair, it's moisturizing but extremely hydrating."

Normally I'd wash my hair with drug store shampoo and by the end of the day it would start to look greasy...by time morning came around it would intolerably greasy. Just wet.  This product does what it says it does. My hair is definitely less oily. I can go two days without washing especially if I use a dry shampoo on day 2.  It's also thicker, and less slick. When I used drug store shampoos, I would NEVER need conditioner...my hair was so slick and soft that there was no point. With this shampoo, I actually do have to use the conditioner if I want to easily brush through my hair when I get out of the shower.  I think this is because of the thickening effect. I use the matching conditioner.  Overall, my hair is still a little oily on day 2 but much more manageable. I'd say it gives me an extra 12 hours before hair starts to get greasy than when I use drugstore shampoo. I think for those of use with super oily hair, there is no miracle where we can go a week without washing. So if you're okay to give up on that idea, then this product is solid. It works."

(I think it's mostly the shampoo, though, because I was using the conditioner with another shampoo for a while and it wasn't as good). My hair is bouncy and shiny and it looks good! After! Going! Three! Days! Without! Washing!!! I switched to every third day on the recommendation of my hairdresser and by the third day my hair was PARCHED it was so dry and like straw. No more with the help of this shampoo. I love how lightweight it is and the smell is clean and fresh.  Seriously- I tried using another shampoo-conditioner combo that ran about $140 for the big bottles ($70 for each) and it was NOT the move. This shampoo is obviously not cheap but it's worth it and does it better than the more expensive ones!!"

I was apprehensive about the moringa oil because I have fine hair that gets oily very easily and noticed that i needed to wash my hair more frequently using this line (shampoo, conditioner, heat protectant) despite my control of the product. On the first day, my hair would be beautifully shiny but felt a little heavier than usual and would wake up the next day with oily hair that i would expect on day 3. However, when I would let my hair air dry (not blow dry it straight) I noticed my curl pattern was defined, springy and beautiful. I will finish these products and might only repurchase them in the summer for when I wear my hair in its natural texture more often."

Initially I liked it, as I've been struggling with hair fall due to stress and this seemed to decrease the amount of hair I was losing each time I washed it. However, the more I use it, the more I dislike it. It makes my hair full of static, ends look more frizzy, and it gets oilier by the second day than when I use other shampoo and conditioners. The scent is just ok. Won't be repurchasing again.  For comparison, I have thicker, 2b, medium length hair and a normal scalp (not dry, not oily). I use a titanium-based straightener most days with my usual heat protectant. If my hair was thinner and drier, I think the static issue would be even worse with this. Which is weird, because it's marketed to thin hair types. It's not because the weather is getting colder and drier either, as I started using this in September when it was still warm, and I sometimes switch with a different shampoo and conditioner and my hair isn't staticy then."

I don't think my hair is necessarily easier to detangle in the shower than with any other shampoo I've used, but it is easy to brush out after using the Ghost shampoo and conditioner together.   I have fine, platinum-blonde wavy hair that is prone to dryness and frizz on the ends and greasiness at the scalp, and it looks great, feels very soft, and smells lemony and amazing after using the Ghost line. My hair doesn't feel weighed down at all. While it doesn't prevent my roots from getting greasiness after a day or so, it certainly doesn't feel any oilier than before. I don't hold this against the product because a) my roots have always been prone to greasiness and b) I work out a lot, so good luck holding that at bay.  I just bought the shampoo and conditioner in the full size and will probably do the same with the Ghost Oil. Really loving this combination so far. I'm just bummed Sephora no longer seems to carry the value set with the big sizes of the shampoo and conditioner and free Ghost Oil."

The packaging looked blah and the price was on the cheaper end so I was thinking this isnu2019t going to be something Iu2019m going to like but omg I was wrong. It is the best I have tried for all my hair issues!!! It lathers wonderful and the smell is very light and it detangles like a champ. My hair has started shedding slightly less and it donu2019t aggravate my scalp. I have now purchased the whole line !! As the saying goes donu2019t judge a book by its cover cause honestly I was about to give this sample away cause it didnu2019t interest me. So glad I tried it. My wallet is happier which makes my husband happier and my hair is happier. So win win in my book."

I've tried 8 different shampoos and nothing worked. I didn't have high hopes when I ordered the pair but I still give it a try based on the reviews here. I kid you not. THIS WORKS. (knock on wood) I have seen less hair fall while brushing and otherwise. It's not gone and can never be gone like that. But it's LESS. My hair has volume. My scalp isn't oily. I can go easily without shampooing for a day now. And for some the shampoo may seem drying but use their conditioner. I've been using it for 3 weeks now.

But don't throw it away just yet! I consider this to be a gentle clarifying shampoo.   TIPS for using this shampoo properly: - do not use other products in your hair that contain silicones (silicone build-up will create a barrier and any benefits from this shampoo will be greatly reduced) - pair it with the conditioner! they work beautifully together. - use only a small (tiny) amount and double shampoo. rince, lather - repeat. - wash your hair max twice (maybe three) time a week with this.  This is a great shampoo if you have hard water at home (most of us do) - because it lathers up a lot and has great cleansing properties. It keeps my hair soft, so shiny and weightless."

The very first time I used it in the evening along with the prep on my damp hair, went to bed and woke up in the morning with mind blowing results.  My hair was softer and cleaner than ever and it actually had BOUNCE and VOLUME!!!  I have been using these products for over a week now and I only grow more impressed each day.  It's such a confidence booster to finally have something that works for me.  Plus it's on the more affordable side which is a bonus and smells amazing!  I went out on a wim trying Verb as it was the first time hearing of this brand, and I am so incredibly happy I took the chance.  I read through lots of reviews before I decided the Ghost products seemed like the right choice for my hair.  I'm excited to try out more of their products but will definitely be sticking with the Ghost shampoo and conditioner! Thank you Verb!"

            "review_text": "Iu2019m giving this 4 stars, only because I received samples on the shampoo/conditioner and verb hair oil from Sephora as a free sample with purchase(so I havenu2019t been using it so long as to give a thorough review imo). I have been using it about a week(there were 5+or so packets in my sample). I had never heard of this product. I am a cosmetologist, and have been a hair stylist since 2006. I use the best products, and most high end products I can get and try being a stylist. Iu2019ve got my favorites of course, but decided to get this sample pack since they didnu2019t have a lot to choose from when I ordered online. Iu2019ve been using the ghost shampoo/conditioner and oil since I got it. I was pleasantly surprised at the lovely lather and light smell from the shampoo, and the softness from the conditioner. I use oils like chi silk infusion and bio silk, so I know good oils. Verb oil seems to be a good oil, although I would need to use it longer to be sure. So far when I use the shampoo/conditioner combo my hair seems very soft and less frizzy. (I have very fine straight hair, my hair usually only frizzes due to the Texas humidity). I do get itchy scalp from dry skin, so I donu2019t know if this helps or not. Overall itu2019s a pretty good product, shiny, soft, and less frizz is a good thing. It has some good things, cruelty free, good for colored hair, etc. I hope it keeps working well, as I will possibly add it to my rotation. (For those wondering yes I have a rotation) I switch my products up depending on what I feel my hair needs, and to keep my hair from becoming too used to a single line. Even having 2 different shampoos/conditioners can be helpful for keeping your hair healthy and happy."

My hair is long, thick, and it's color-treated (balayage). Due to my hair's thickness I wash it about 2 times a week. Every time I wash my hair this shampoo does a great job in removing all the oils from my scalp and any products I may have in my hair. It leaves my hair so clean, more so than any product I used before this one. It's a little pricey but I think it's worth it. One pump is enough for my long hair and it lathers up so quickly! Plus, I love the minimalist design of the bottle, the light smell, and that it's a cruelty-free product. Highly recommend!"

However I'm not a fan of the scent because I don't really like citrus. It's also expensive for the small size you get and in my opinion not worth it. There are probably more affordable options out there that will give similar results. But if you really want to splurge then this isn't a bad choice."

I'm so upset I didn't realize it sooner but I'm grateful it wasn't worse. My hair is now so thin but after stopping using this shampoo I lose maybe a few strands of hair in the shower like I always had before I started using this product, instead of >50 strands. After scanning the ingredients, I discovered this has hydrogen peroxide which causes major damage to hair and can lead to it falling out. Even though it's far down on the ingredient list, I don't doubt it could cause this reaction. Do yourself a favor and don't bother purchasing this. I immediately threw this product and the conditioner out and switched to a different, natural haircare brand. I've never been so angry with a product's performance."

The shampoo is creamy and lathers well enough depending on the amount you use.

The new formula contains sodium chloride, which means it isnu2019t compatible with keratin treatments (note: if you have a Brazilian blowout sodium chloride is fine, but other keratin treatments will be compromised by sodium chloride).

It is true I have been using my curler more often this year (never exceeding more than 1x per week and always on dry hair w/ heat protectant) but I still believe it is partially because this shampoo/conditioner is not as nourishing as my old one. I have stopped using this for a month since I realized the damage and using the remainder of my old brand (gloss moderne) and my hair is already feeling much healthier. I did not notice this initially but when I compared using this with the other one within a close period of time, my hair is much softer after washing with gloss moderne.  Pros:  - Originally switched to this because my hair was getting oily at the roots more quickly with my old shampoo and conditioner, and this keeps me less oily on shampoo day. - Great value, lasts a long time. Originally got this because of the price and I like their ghost oil. After a year of use I still have half left."

This past winter I had a serious hair crisis: my water softener broke and the only shampoos that made my hair feel clean were clarifying shampoos for every wash (every 2-3 days).  I used the clarifying shampoos by Living Proof, Kenra, Frederic Fekkai and Ion.  These shampoos, combined with very dry wood heat from November to May, left my hair so brittle it was breaking off mid-shaft.  Then I would layer on heavy masks to try to repair and heal the damage (Eva Nyc, Joico, Paul Mitchell, Matrix, Redken).  But my hair was just left so heavy, dull and coated that the cycle of harsh shampoos and heavy conditioners continued for months.  I read some articles for natural curly-haired women and learned about keeping a protein moisture balance, and the dangers of sulfates and silicones -very helpful!  My husband finally fixed the water softener but my limp, waxy, brittle hair continued.  I asked the Sephora employee for a sample of the Ghost shampoo and I have found the solution to my hair nightmare!  This is a sulfate-free shampoo that actually leaves my hair feeling CLEAN, but NOT like straw!  I now understand that my hair can not tolerate most silicones - they build up heavily and easily on my hair.  I am currently using Garnier Fructis Pure and Clean conditioner, Living Proof Restore Leave-in cream, Aveda Volumizing tonic and Ghost Dry Shampoo for Light Hair.  I will be definitely be purchasing more of this Ghost line!  The scent is fine (I was spoiled by the gorgeous fragrance of Eva NYC) and the price is refreshingly sane (looking at you, Living Proof).  Thank you for the sample Sephora :)"

They do have similar qualities when it comes to propensity of being irritating to the skin but sodium C14-16 olefin sulfonate is not a sulfate.  Sodium C14-16 olefin sulfonate may have a drying effect on oneu2019s scalp and hair but if in need of a strong cleanser to remove buildup or dirt, then this agent may be the one for you. It is a safe and excellent surfactant to use.  Just because it says u201cSulfu201d in the name doesnu2019t automatically make it a sulfate. If you are avoiding sulfates, know why you are avoiding them and what you are looking to get out of a shampoo."

It's gentle and the scent is subtle (basically nothing), which can be important nowadays at a time when everyone seems to have an aversion to smells.   I liked Briogeo's green shampoo/conditioner as well but it was tooooo pricey  I tried the Hydrate shampoo and conditioner and didn't like it (HEAVY, like weighed my thick hair down, which is hard to do since it can get voluminous relatively easily compared to other people) and slightly greasy.   And love that it's sulfate free!! Learned the importance of that from JVN from Queer Eye lol"

I still get flaky scalp once in a while, especially during winter. I just massage a bit of coconut oil on my scalp before using the Ghost duo and it leaves my hair soft and my scalp hydrated without flakes for a solid 3-4 days. Smells great too! I've just purchased the 946ml version and I've calculated that since I wash my hair less, it's cheaper than buying my old drugstore brand. I'm definitely sold and will continue to repurchase!"

The company advertises that this shampoo has no sulfates but the second ingredient is a sulfate (hate to break it to you Verb but Sodium C14-16 Olefin Sulfonate is a harsh sulfate)"

The silicone in this shampoo is water soluble and doesn't build up in my hair.  Ghost leaves my hair soft, shiny, and light feeling without being flyaway.  It has protected the color and my stylist has commented on how nice my hair feels and how well the color has held up.  I live in a small town in Alaska where we don't have much in the way of hair care shopping options other than the grocery store.  I am so happy I found this product line.

My hair is pretty fine from being bleached and processed, but this seemed like it stripped my hair tone then made my hair literally like a lion's mane. I'm not quite sure what was going on there. It made my hair soft, but it was like super voluminous and thick, I just wasn't feeling it... I used this shampoo and the  Verb Ghost Conditioner as a duo and did not like the outcome my hair had that day. Ditched it. Didn't work on my hair, but on thick, frizzy hair I think this would work out. Also, for the price it does seem worth it."

The only reason Iu2019m not giving it 5 stars is because Iu2019ve found that the recommended small amount just isnu2019t enough for my hair and I either have to use double the amount or Iu2019m washing my hair twice (both times with just a bit).

It left my hair feeling squeaky clean and super soft. Not to mention, my color looks as vibrant as ever! The smell is subtle, but fresh (maybe a little citrus-y?). 5 Stars   some...

The smell is great; a unisex fresh and clean scent that is subtle and pleasant. Once I blow-dried, the first thing I noticed was how incredibly shiny my hair was: I'm talking blinding. And my hair was so, so soft and bouncy at the same time. This shampoo basically gave me shampoo commercial hair. Holy Grail for sure!! Verb - I'm here for Ghost Shampoo and Conditioner in liters."
