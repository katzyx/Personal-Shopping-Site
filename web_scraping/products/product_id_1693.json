			"review_text": "Verb Ghost is the best shampoo and conditioner I’ve tried. My hair looks super shiny just by using them without any leave-in conditioners, masks or oils.   They really are a weightless shampoo and conditioner because my hair feels so light and looks full. I have medium density hair and this works like a dream for me. Like whenever I use it, I have way less hair fall, less dandruff, less oiliness and more days I can go without needing to shampoo my hair.   I love how the shampoo doesn’t make my hair knotty and squeaky but instead makes it feel silky yet cleansed when washing. This is good because usually shampoos that make my hair feel squeaky clean give me hair loss. I also love how my scalp feels so clean, light, and refreshing afterwards. I’ve never had that feeling with any shampoos before.   It’s a whole spa experience for me honestly. A lot of shampoos are so frustrating to work into my scalp and to rinse off, but not this one. It actually calms my stress with how easy it is to use. You also don’t have to use much to get your hair clean, just be sure to double-cleanse.  I’ve only used the sample packs of the shampoo and conditioner but I will be buying the full bottles. But not at Sephora, it’s expensive here. I feel like the conditioner bottle should be white and the shampoo bottle should be black, it confuses me."

Yes you can go to the drugstore and grab cheaper shampoo, but this is high quality.  As far as Sephora hair care goes, this is an affordable option.  Love it!!

I have a lot of long fine bleached hair, and this gets my hair clean without stripping or drying.  Regarding the low reviews stating it doesn’t lather/ is drying: you need to double shampoo!! First wash I use one pump, spread on both hands, and scrub your scalp. On my second wash I don’t even need a full pump it lathers so much. And people tend to not use enough conditioner. I have a lot of hair and its dry, so I use probably around 4 pumps. Conditioner only hydrates and conditions your hair, if you have fine hair or long hair you need to use something for detangling. I use the verb oil and I use the pureology detangling spray. You cant just rely on a single shampoo and conditioner line to take care of your hair needs, especially a clean hair line."

I tried Olaplex and deep conditioning as well, but it is not working. My hair feels hard (I don't know how to explain this) and dry.

I thought I got a bad batch the first time I bought 1L bottles after my 355ml ones because it was so runny and didn’t cleanse my hair properly, left it feeling greasy. So I ordered small bottles again and the texture is completely different. Thicker and cleans my hair much better.  I don’t recommend the big bottles which sucks because your saving money, but I’m telling you it’s not the same at all and I’m not sure why they are doing that… to save on product and money I suppose."

About 2 hours later I noticed how itchy my scalp was (not normal for me) and how much gunk I was able to scrap off my head (ew). I went and looked in the mirror & saw that my whole head was covered in shampoo residue, dry skin ext ext ! My head continued to itch all evening. I will be returning. P.S I think I wash my scalp well, double lather and rinse out well so I can't say that was a factor."

Full disclosure: my routine is to shampoo/conditioner (let conditioner sit about 3-5 min) and then I use Sol de Janeiro leave-in conditioner as it's drying, and that did really well with this product.

Lathers well enough to feel clean but not drying. I don't get this squeaky or straw like feeling I get with other shampoos while washing. There's not too much of a moisture effect that feels like it's being weighed down it also doesn't give me scalp acne.   The thing I liked most was how when my hair finished drying, my scalp didn't feel tight, dry, or itchy. It just felt normal.  I do have to say that there isn't super significant results when it comes to how your hair looks. It just makes my hair feel lighter and balanced.

I bought the duo along with the healing oil which I use on my scalp and ends before bed the night before a wash and then double wash in the shower and let the conditioner sit. After my double wash tho my hair feels almost stripped of moisture? But once I add the conditioner it re adds the moisture I’ve lost .  What I like about this duo is the way it has brought curls and volume back into my hair once it’s dry. I believe this works best with the healing oil and the verb oil as well. My hair is medium thickness and curly/wavy but I straighten it most days and it lasts about 3/4 days at most before I need to wash again. I’m going to give this a fair shot and use the whole bottle and hopefully buy again!"

			"review_text": "I have mixed feelings about this shampoo and conditioner. Got both in the standard size a couple of months ago. At first, I really liked it, but I didn't love it. It didn't leave my hair as dry as some other shampoos do, and the conditioner made them feel smoother without adding more weight, even while still in a shower. These days, I wash my hair a couple of times a week, so I expected that this stay-at-home regiment would help my strands heal. I have fine curly hair that I used to straighten daily with a dryer and sometimes iron until relatively recently. What happened with this set, however, is that I started having dandruff after about a month. I had never had dandruff in my life before! It also seems that I'm losing more hair than I used to. Despite using a decent amount of conditioner, I can barely brush my wet hair. And if I don't brush when it's still wet, I may not be able to brush it at all. This is despite using the Ghost oil (that I generally like) and Moroccan Oil leave-in conditioner for my ends. I was attributing these issues to the general stress and cold weather but as I read negative reviews, I thought of other brands that I liked at the beginning and then started to like less, and it was the opposite problem: they made my hair greasy after two bottles, but at the beginning, they moisturized and conditioned perfectly. I'll give this product three stars and the benefit of the doubt: maybe it works better on other hair types."

It is long and wavy. I did not use hair masks during that time. It is virgin hair and I do not use hot tools on it.  It is a fine shampoo and conditioner. Especially for the price. It will end up being similarly priced to some drugstore shampoos/conditioners. I enjoyed using the shampoo. It was foamy and light. It won't make the hair feel hydrated but it does make it feel clean without stripping it.   Same thing for the conditioner. It is not meant to be very hydrating but at least it helped control frizz. On the other hand, it can make my hair staticky which can be helped with a bit of hair oil.  Overall, both products are fine. The smell is nice, the texture is nice. I don't believe the interesting ingredients add anything to the effects of the product. It is just basic a shampoo and conditioner.  I would rather try the hydrating shampoo/conditioner instead of repurchasing the Ghost line.   PS: It took me so long to finish the products that in the end, the conditioner became 'caked' on the walls of the bottle. Nothing against the product but it is the reality of having less and less product inside the bottle and it drying out overtime."

I bought it again like 2 weeks ago and i still like it, but it seems to make my hair a little greasy no matter how much time I spend rinsing it out. I used a different shampoo to double check and this one is definitely the problem. Wondering if maybe they changed the ingredients or something. I like how shiny and soft it makes my hair, but if you have fine hair I would maybe stay away."

I have thick hair that is dry on the ends and easily oily scalp if not washed everyday. I've tried Redken, Biolage, Herbal Essence, Fructis, and all kinds of shampoos and still could not find the right shampoo.  Verb shampoo seems to be made for fine hair mostly, but my hair did not react badly to it like it did to other shampoos. My hair didn't shed as much, and the foaming was instant when I rubbed some of it onto my hair. The smell was like a shampoo of a very nice hotel (smells good but definitely not overpowering). If you do have dry hair though, I suggest getting a good hydrating conditioner because it does get a bit dry (that's my hair reaction though, might be different for others)."

Lately it’s been feeling a little too fine and fragile for my personal comfort. I tried this, and O.M.G.  It lathers beautifully, it’s super sudsy and I liked how clean it felt after my hair dried. It felt like it cleaned all the excess product from my hair without stripping it dry. It contains aloe, so I could definitely feel and see a difference in the hydration overall of my scalp and hair. I can’t speak for everyone, but if you have somewhat dry hair or wear your hair back a lot and want a light, airy shampoo for your tresses, this is it. Also, it’s like heavenly soft. Like, sleep on a cloud but that cloud is your hair - pillow.  Basically, it’s 5 solid stars for me !!"

It is probably better for those who use a lot of hair product (I literally only use straight argan oil). The conditioner seemed nice, however. I really like that a little bit went a long way (as in it was very easy to distribute and cover my hair without waste). But, it just doesn't seem conditioning enough to combat the stripping nature of the shampoo.   I give it 3 stars because it is certainly better than most other shampoo+conditioner duos that I've used, and I'm sure that this shampoo works well for those that use a lot of products that they need to remove in the shower."

Definitely leaves hair feeling clean and not stripped of moisture aka does not dry out. Will say that on my color treated hair, I think it does leave my hair somewhat more brassy faster than other color safe shampoos. Wouldn't necessarily suggest this for color treated hair, but overall a good shampoo. The purple conditioner Verb however, I would HIGHLY recommend."

After soaking my hair I started with the Verb Ghost Shampoo, using the whole sample (my hair is just past my shoulders and fine in texture, so it took in a decent amount, a bit over quarter size).  Maybe it’s called Ghost because it just disappears! But in a good way! It simply drinks into your hair, lathers and works in completely.  It also rinses out smoothly and cleanly, no build up feeling. My hair is also color treated (permanent red) and at least in my experience, the product was quite kind on it.  My hair is NEVER just shampooed, so I completed the wash with a conditioner (Ghost Conditioner).  Overall I was very, very pleased with my experience! The scent was quite pleasant and left my hair feeling light (not weighed down with product like some brands). I would absolutely give this product a try!"

This shampoo claims to naturally smooth frizz and promote radiant shine for all hair types. Sunflower seed extract provides natural UV protection while guarding against color fading as quinoa protein strengthens, protects, and encourages hair growth. A hint of grapefruit and oatmeal blend together to leave your hair with a light fresh fragrance, while moringa oil infuses the hair shaft with essential nutrients. This shampoo also lathered nicely and left my hair feeling clean and nourished. My hair was definitely smoother after using this along with its matching conditioner, but unfortunately my hair also felt weighed down and became greasy after just a day. I personally have fine thin straight hair so even though this shampoo claims to be for all hair types, it’s just not for me. For these reasons, I wouldn’t buy a full size bottle."

My hair texture was fine before (I never heat style or use leave-in products), and was quite soft and shiny. But after trying the shampoo/conditioner it noticed it becoming frizzy (it NEVER gets frizzy, it is stick-straight and can barely hold a wave), feels weirdly wispy, and I’m noticing a lot of tangles. My hair is also shedding more, probably because of the tangles. I recently noticed how few split ends I have, but after using this and noticing the weird wispy texture I checked my ends and sure enough there is a plethora of damaged ends.  I WAS growing my hair long… but now I’m going to cut it because of the tangling issue, the weird wispy texture and the sudden onset of split ends. I really regret not just sticking with drugstore shampoo. I have a feeling this shampoo damaged my hair shaft, due to this new weird wispy texture and propensity to tangle. It looks duller, dryer, and less shiny after using verb. When I jog w/ hair in a pony, my pony will stay-- I just went on a jog and my hair just slid right out. It also looks much thinner in a pony now. I miss my old healthy hair :’(  Can not recommend for people w/ fine hair (or anyone really). My hair feels like cob webs (yuck). Will be returning."

Normally I'd wash my hair with drug store shampoo and by the end of the day it would start to look greasy...by time morning came around it would intolerably greasy. Just wet.  This product does what it says it does. My hair is definitely less oily. I can go two days without washing especially if I use a dry shampoo on day 2.  It's also thicker, and less slick. When I used drug store shampoos, I would NEVER need conditioner...my hair was so slick and soft that there was no point. With this shampoo, I actually do have to use the conditioner if I want to easily brush through my hair when I get out of the shower.  I think this is because of the thickening effect. I use the matching conditioner.  Overall, my hair is still a little oily on day 2 but much more manageable. I'd say it gives me an extra 12 hours before hair starts to get greasy than when I use drugstore shampoo. I think for those of use with super oily hair, there is no miracle where we can go a week without washing. So if you're okay to give up on that idea, then this product is solid. It works."

Three! Days! Without! Washing!!! I switched to every third day on the recommendation of my hairdresser and by the third day my hair was PARCHED it was so dry and like straw. No more with the help of this shampoo. I love how lightweight it is and the smell is clean and fresh.

I was apprehensive about the moringa oil because I have fine hair that gets oily very easily and noticed that i needed to wash my hair more frequently using this line (shampoo, conditioner, heat protectant) despite my control of the product. On the first day, my hair would be beautifully shiny but felt a little heavier than usual and would wake up the next day with oily hair that i would expect on day 3. However, when I would let my hair air dry (not blow dry it straight) I noticed my curl pattern was defined, springy and beautiful.

Initially I liked it, as I've been struggling with hair fall due to stress and this seemed to decrease the amount of hair I was losing each time I washed it. However, the more I use it, the more I dislike it. It makes my hair full of static, ends look more frizzy, and it gets oilier by the second day than when I use other shampoo and conditioners. The scent is just ok. Won't be repurchasing again.  For comparison, I have thicker, 2b, medium length hair and a normal scalp (not dry, not oily). I use a titanium-based straightener most days with my usual heat protectant. If my hair was thinner and drier, I think the static issue would be even worse with this. Which is weird, because it's marketed to thin hair types. It's not because the weather is getting colder and drier either, as I started using this in September when it was still warm, and I sometimes switch with a different shampoo and conditioner and my hair isn't staticy then."

They smell amazing, light and citrusy, and I appreciate that the shampoo lathers a bit but not to excess and doesn't feel drying. I don't think my hair is necessarily easier to detangle in the shower than with any other shampoo I've used, but it is easy to brush out after using the Ghost shampoo and conditioner together.   I have fine, platinum-blonde wavy hair that is prone to dryness and frizz on the ends and greasiness at the scalp, and it looks great, feels very soft, and smells lemony and amazing after using the Ghost line. My hair doesn't feel weighed down at all. While it doesn't prevent my roots from getting greasiness after a day or so, it certainly doesn't feel any oilier than before. I don't hold this against the product because a) my roots have always been prone to greasiness and b) I work out a lot, so good luck holding that at bay.  I just bought the shampoo and conditioner in the full size and will probably do the same with the Ghost Oil. Really loving this combination so far.

My hair is colored nearly black and I don’t feel that this fades the color at all. Very great quality for the price."

But don't throw it away just yet! I consider this to be a gentle clarifying shampoo.   TIPS for using this shampoo properly: - do not use other products in your hair that contain silicones (silicone build-up will create a barrier and any benefits from this shampoo will be greatly reduced) - pair it with the conditioner! they work beautifully together. - use only a small (tiny) amount and double shampoo. rince, lather - repeat. - wash your hair max twice (maybe three) time a week with this.  This is a great shampoo if you have hard water at home (most of us do) - because it lathers up a lot and has great cleansing properties. It keeps my hair soft, so shiny and weightless."

I have wasted ridiculous amounts of money on different hair products but now I can confidently say those days are over.  The Ghost line has brought my hair to LIFE!  The very first time I used it in the evening along with the prep on my damp hair, went to bed and woke up in the morning with mind blowing results.  My hair was softer and cleaner than ever and it actually had BOUNCE and VOLUME!!!  I have been using these products for over a week now and I only grow more impressed each day.  It's such a confidence booster to finally have something that works for me.  Plus it's on the more affordable side which is a bonus and smells amazing!  I went out on a wim trying Verb as it was the first time hearing of this brand, and I am so incredibly happy I took the chance.  I read through lots of reviews before I decided the Ghost products seemed like the right choice for my hair.  I'm excited to try out more of their products but will definitely be sticking with the Ghost shampoo and conditioner! Thank you Verb!"

			"review_text": "I’m giving this 4 stars, only because I received samples on the shampoo/conditioner and verb hair oil from Sephora as a free sample with purchase(so I haven’t been using it so long as to give a thorough review imo). I have been using it about a week(there were 5+or so packets in my sample). I had never heard of this product. I am a cosmetologist, and have been a hair stylist since 2006. I use the best products, and most high end products I can get and try being a stylist. I’ve got my favorites of course, but decided to get this sample pack since they didn’t have a lot to choose from when I ordered online. I’ve been using the ghost shampoo/conditioner and oil since I got it. I was pleasantly surprised at the lovely lather and light smell from the shampoo, and the softness from the conditioner. I use oils like chi silk infusion and bio silk, so I know good oils. Verb oil seems to be a good oil, although I would need to use it longer to be sure. So far when I use the shampoo/conditioner combo my hair seems very soft and less frizzy. (I have very fine straight hair, my hair usually only frizzes due to the Texas humidity). I do get itchy scalp from dry skin, so I don’t know if this helps or not. Overall it’s a pretty good product, shiny, soft, and less frizz is a good thing. It has some good things, cruelty free, good for colored hair, etc. I hope it keeps working well, as I will possibly add it to my rotation. (For those wondering yes I have a rotation) I switch my products up depending on what I feel my hair needs, and to keep my hair from becoming too used to a single line. Even having 2 different shampoos/conditioners can be helpful for keeping your hair healthy and happy."

The shampoo and conditioner felt nice in the shower and the smell wasn’t bad but then I finally noticed hair loss. A LOT of hair loss. Clumps and clump were coming out and it was not due to stress. Finished the bottles to give them a chance, but the hair loss was significant and dandruff did not get better."

Initially I thought it was stress causing it since I was going through a very stressful time in my life, however when I stopped using this shampoo for a number of days and my hair stopped falling out in clumps in the shower (I mean literal CLUMPS). I'm so upset I didn't realize it sooner but I'm grateful it wasn't worse. My hair is now so thin but after stopping using this shampoo I lose maybe a few strands of hair in the shower like I always had before I started using this product, instead of >50 strands. After scanning the ingredients, I discovered this has hydrogen peroxide which causes major damage to hair and can lead to it falling out. Even though it's far down on the ingredient list, I don't doubt it could cause this reaction. Do yourself a favor and don't bother purchasing this. I immediately threw this product and the conditioner out and switched to a different, natural haircare brand. I've never been so angry with a product's performance."

This will keep your hair clean and fresh between washes and can keep your scalp from feeling oily or grimy for up to 3 days.

It’s not very effective, as my scalp feels oily and such much sooner than after I use other shampoos. The sticky/tacky feeling doesn’t go away, either—it makes my hair look greasy later in the day because it sticks in clumps, and when I rinse between washes, it still has that awful tacky feeling.   I’m at the point where I don’t even know if I’ll finish it to get my money’s worth. I really, really dislike this product."

I am now OBSESSED with Verb products!! I have to wash my hair daily so roots doesn't feel oily but this shampoo does not dry out my hair, honestly makes my hair so soft, smooth, shiny yet light. I absolutely love it. The scent is so light so it doesn't interfere with any perfume etc.... a little goes a long way. There are many great hair products if you are willing to pay $50 for a small bottle but Verb is reasonable and love the simple esthetic of the packaging too. I am so glad I tried it. I now use Ghost lines, Reset lines, Hudrate line, Leave in spray, .... I love ALL of them ❤❤❤"

It is true I have been using my curler more often this year (never exceeding more than 1x per week and always on dry hair w/ heat protectant) but I still believe it is partially because this shampoo/conditioner is not as nourishing as my old one. I have stopped using this for a month since I realized the damage and using the remainder of my old brand (gloss moderne) and my hair is already feeling much healthier. I did not notice this initially but when I compared using this with the other one within a close period of time, my hair is much softer after washing with gloss moderne.  Pros:  - Originally switched to this because my hair was getting oily at the roots more quickly with my old shampoo and conditioner, and this keeps me less oily on shampoo day. - Great value, lasts a long time. Originally got this because of the price and I like their ghost oil. After a year of use I still have half left."

Too much oil and my hair is weighed down, too little and curls turn into a frizzy mess. I am very much on the low-poo train but need something once in a while to clean out gunk.  I have tried gentle cleansers from Devacurl and the like and they don't seem to clean my hair enough.  And anything stronger strips my hair of too much oil. This is THE ONLY shampoo that cleans my hair but still leaves my curls fresh and is gentle enough for my fine hair. And considering I'm using it no more than once a week, an entire bottle lasts me a year.  Given the price, this is a no brainer!"

To the point of minor alopecia and my dermatologist stating “there is nothing else we can do for you”. The only thing that seemed to work was green juicing (this is expensive and inconvenient at times) The next wash I went back to my regular shampoo and the irritation was back. I’d learned my lesson and purchased the full size. Continued use is required for relief, but I am not complaining, Ghost is like nothing I’ve ever tried. I even bought pure organic moringa oil (ghost’s active ingredient) thinking the potency would be more effective and not the least bit. Maybe it’s best when it’s broken down, but I’m done trying others-please keep this product forever."

This past winter I had a serious hair crisis: my water softener broke and the only shampoos that made my hair feel clean were clarifying shampoos for every wash (every 2-3 days).  I used the clarifying shampoos by Living Proof, Kenra, Frederic Fekkai and Ion.  These shampoos, combined with very dry wood heat from November to May, left my hair so brittle it was breaking off mid-shaft.  Then I would layer on heavy masks to try to repair and heal the damage (Eva Nyc, Joico, Paul Mitchell, Matrix, Redken).  But my hair was just left so heavy, dull and coated that the cycle of harsh shampoos and heavy conditioners continued for months.  I read some articles for natural curly-haired women and learned about keeping a protein moisture balance, and the dangers of sulfates and silicones -very helpful!  My husband finally fixed the water softener but my limp, waxy, brittle hair continued.  I asked the Sephora employee for a sample of the Ghost shampoo and I have found the solution to my hair nightmare!  This is a sulfate-free shampoo that actually leaves my hair feeling CLEAN, but NOT like straw!  I now understand that my hair can not tolerate most silicones - they build up heavily and easily on my hair.  I am currently using Garnier Fructis Pure and Clean conditioner, Living Proof Restore Leave-in cream, Aveda Volumizing tonic and Ghost Dry Shampoo for Light Hair.  I will be definitely be purchasing more of this Ghost line!  The scent is fine (I was spoiled by the gorgeous fragrance of Eva NYC) and the price is refreshingly sane (looking at you, Living Proof).  Thank you for the sample Sephora :)"

Is Sodium C14-16 olefin sulfonate a sulfate? The name may be misleading, but sodium C14-16 olefin sulfonate is not a sulfate. Sulfonate is related to but not the same as sulfates. In a sulfonate the sulfur is linked direct to a carbon atom where as a sulfate is linked directly to the carbon chain via an oxygen atom. They do have similar qualities when it comes to propensity of being irritating to the skin but sodium C14-16 olefin sulfonate is not a sulfate.  Sodium C14-16 olefin sulfonate may have a drying effect on one’s scalp and hair but if in need of a strong cleanser to remove buildup or dirt, then this agent may be the one for you. It is a safe and excellent surfactant to use.  Just because it says “Sulf” in the name doesn’t automatically make it a sulfate. If you are avoiding sulfates, know why you are avoiding them and what you are looking to get out of a shampoo."

However, in LA, this shampoo has caused me and my partner to develop dandruff. As it has affected both of us, I feel something is wrong with the shampoo. Maybe it’s the different water quality on the coasts, but I assume the company would have quality tested and controlled for multiple environments. Moreover, I have not experienced such geographical discrepancy from other products. I’m very disappointed in this product and am still working to address a new dandruff issue."

My hair was a greasy mess with a flaky scalp, and the Ghost duo changed everything. It leaves my hair soft, my scalp clean for way longer than any other shampoo I've tried before. I still get flaky scalp once in a while, especially during winter. I just massage a bit of coconut oil on my scalp before using the Ghost duo and it leaves my hair soft and my scalp hydrated without flakes for a solid 3-4 days. Smells great too! I've just purchased the 946ml version and I've calculated that since I wash my hair less, it's cheaper than buying my old drugstore brand. I'm definitely sold and will continue to repurchase!"

So, if some of you are reading reviews where it weighed their hair down, it could be that they are using too much. I have hair three inches past my shoulders, and it’s fine, but I have a lot of fine hair. I just use about a dollop the size of a quarter, distribute between my hands, and it spreads so well throughout my hair, I use this size for both conditioner and shampoo. I ordered the kit with the shampoo, conditioner, hairspray, and ghost oil, waiting for that to come to see how the rest goes."

My hair is long and fine, but a lot of it.  It doesn't do well with products that have the heavy-duty silicones in them.  The silicone in this shampoo is water soluble and doesn't build up in my hair.  Ghost leaves my hair soft, shiny, and light feeling without being flyaway.  It has protected the color and my stylist has commented on how nice my hair feels and how well the color has held up.  I live in a small town in Alaska where we don't have much in the way of hair care shopping options other than the grocery store.  I am so happy I found this product line.

This stuff lathered well but that's about the only good thing I can say for it. It left my hair tangled together, rough, and FLAT. It's so lightweight that it literally didn't do anything nourishing for my hair, yet somehow heavy enough to flatten my hair down to nothing?!

I’ve used a lot of different ones (from Keune to Bumble to drugstore brands) but this one seemed to actually work. I’ve only had it for a few weeks and both times I’ve washed, it’s been after 3-4 days, but it’s made my head and hair feel clean without being absurdly dry. I used this one week then used my other shampoo at my boyfriend’s and there was a noticeable difference in the two results.   The only reason I’m not giving it 5 stars is because I’ve found that the recommended small amount just isn’t enough for my hair and I either have to use double the amount or I’m washing my hair twice (both times with just a bit). I do have a heinous amount of hair though, and it’s incredibly thick/coarse. I also really lean into the whole “ooh it’s not lathering and therefore it’s not working!” thing so take this with a grain of salt."

It's light weight and leaves no residue, and is color safe to boot. The bottles are a little small (355ml is less than half a liter, and most water bottles are around 500ml if that gives a visual of the amount). This shampoo also does not lather well, but cleans the hair wonderfully. I have long thick hair and this does the trick. I would definitely pair it with its duo conditioner."

But felt I needed to share this wonderful product. Received this in a VIB gift. Seriously amazing shampoo. I have blonde fine hair and lots of bonded extensions. This worked fantastic for both! Usually anything light weight leaves my extensions in a tangled mess. Everything else moisturizing weighs my natural hair down. This moisturizers and doesn't weigh my hair down. I am buying 2 just in case they sell out quickly. Best shampoo ever."

The key is that there are no sulfates used in their products which greatly damages your hair, there is a nice light smell, and it's a great price relative to other salon brands.  I've used other products that are twice as expensive but don't work nearly as well!"

Because it is so light it might work better for someone who has shorter hair. The foaming/sudsing is awesome. I would describe the scent as pleasant and more clean or very lightly floral, but definitely not fruity."

I was optimistic because I do have thin, fine hair that is easily weighed down.  Unfortunately, this shampoo made my hair horribly dry.  The texture of my hair was like straw, and it was easily a tangled mess.  This shampoo is probably good if you have very oily hair, but it did not work for me."

It's still super soft & shiny too. Love love love!!!"
