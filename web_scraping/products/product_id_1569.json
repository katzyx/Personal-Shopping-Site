			"review_text": "This product is really good I brought it on my trip to Mexico, and used it on my scalp since I always burn there. I was worried that the 35 spf was not going to be enough for me because I have pretty fair skin but I re-applied it multiple times in a day and it worked very well, my scalp didn't burn once. I think that a lot of people are confused with the packaging. You first open the lid then u have to push down the plastic part that compresses the brush. Then you will see a yellow piece in the middle of the brush, this is a stopper. It is meant to come out, it takes a bit of a pull to get out, but once you remove it the powder comes out very easily and is very easy to work with. It blended into my scalp very nicely and there was no patches of powder visible. I would give it a five star review but just because of how much product you get, for the price is not a lot but then again you don't have to use that much each use."

As someone who's always on the go and values convenience in skincare, this product has become an essential part of my daily routine. The powder formula makes it incredibly easy to apply and reapply sunscreen throughout the day without disrupting my makeup or leaving behind a greasy residue.  I appreciate that it offers SPF 35 protection, giving me peace of mind knowing my skin is shielded from the sun's harmful rays. Plus, being a mineral sunscreen, it's gentle on my sensitive skin and doesn't cause any irritation or breakouts.  One of the standout features for me is its versatility. Not only does it provide sun protection, but it also helps to set my makeup, giving me a matte finish that lasts for hours. It's like a two-in-one product that simplifies my beauty routine and saves me time.  However, I do have to mention that the packaging could be a bit more user-friendly. While the built-in brush is convenient for application on the go, it can be a bit messy and difficult to control the amount of product dispensed.  Overall, Supergoop!'s (Re)setting 100% Mineral Powder SPF 35 Mineral Sunscreen has earned a permanent place in my skincare arsenal. Its effectiveness, convenience, and skin-friendly formula make it a standout product that I highly recommend to anyone looking for hassle-free sun protection."

I had a hard time trusting that this powder would protect me from the harsh Caribbean sun because it’s so light and translucent but it actually did its job. I’ve even applied it on my kids when they needed a quick touch up on the go. 1 out of 3 of us that used it has extremely sensitive skin and it didn’t cause any irritation or problems. I only wish it was also available in a larger size so we could apply it to for larger areas like legs/ back etc easily."

Unfortunately the “open/close” function on this did not work for me at all and I had to open the powder from the bottom and dump it onto my wrist, which is not easy to control the amount coming out and makes this product not very portable or efficient. Because there was so much product that came out the product come off cakey on my face. This might not happen if the applicator worked properly with a controlled amount of product being used.   Another poorly thought out design for the product is the tube part that the powder is supposed to come out of is in line with the product brush so you can’t really compress the brush on your face because the applicator is hard plastic. This makes application difficult even if the product were to come out properly.   Hopefully they can improve this product in the future because I really want to try this product for daily SPF"

Matte, and good overtop makeup. Package could use some work as I found it twists too far so you have to be gentle (read the instructions first before using). A little goes a long way if you use it right."

			"review_text": "Here is the thing: this product needs a bigger container and refills. 46$ for this tiny amount is outrageous. BUT, that being said, it's incredible. Fits SO beautifully over the It Cosmetics Glow CC Cream. It blurs pores, keeps shine at bay and has really good sun protection. It is meant to be used as a touch up over makeup (because let's be realistic, who washes their face every 2 hours to reapply sunscreen and redo their makeup), not your sole sun protection. And again : it has to be used the right way. Make sure the bottle in unlocked (lock it before putting it in your purse). When it's unlocked, grap it with the brush downwards and just give it one shake down. The powder will fill the brush and you are ready to apply.  It works great for me. My only complaint is that there isn't enough product for it to be sustainable. You'd need a new product every 7-10 days if you apply it every day,  a couple of times a day."

I trough out the box. I hope I can return it. This product should be like a compact format."

			"review_text": "I took this on a 3-week trip to Australia and New Zealand where I had a ton of beach and pool time. This achieved what I was looking for - a powder formula that applies easily without ruining my makeup. It provides good coverage and mattifies the skin. It's easy to apply with the built-in brush. However, as many have noted in this review section, the packaging is strangely convoluted. Every time I want to use it, I have to remove the lid (and hold that lid with one hand), push down the brush cylinder, then turn the powder lock to open in order to use. Then reverse those steps to close it! Often when I turn to close it, it somehow unscrews the whole powder chamber instead of lock into the closed position. Not an elegant product design. Luckily mine didn't break like others' did.   Hoping that Supergoop or some other brand could come up with more affordable powder SPF options with better application designs."
