My hair is fine and easily weighed down by oils but that wasn’t an issue with this product. It is a bit thick for a spray and you have to work it in or brush it through, but I do think it helps protect hair from heat because my curls were much softer than usual and it felt like they held on to moisture from washing much better. It does not have any hold so you have to use a gel or mousse if you want the curls to stay. I also used it one day to style my hair with a curling iron, and it really did keep the hair softer and more sleek than without using it. I don’t love the smell but it’s not bothersome. It didn’t do much for my frizz but again, a styler with hold will do better for that. Overall I think it’s a good choice for if you use heat to dry or style your hair."

I don’t do much heat styling so I’ve been using this after the shower to help with frizz and give some shine. It does kind of make my hair feel slightly crunchy and heavy but maybe I’ve used too much. It doesn’t make my hair look greasy though it actually does help with the frizz and look nice but I’m not crazy about how it feels. The upside to this is that I think if you were using it for heat styling, particularly curling, I think it would help hair hold and curl and combat frizz. I also used it in my daughters curly hair and it seemed to work better for her. It smells really good, like coconut but really sweet. It doesn’t serve a purpose for me personally but if you used heat on your hair often I can see it being a staple product."

I like to spray on damp hair as a detangler and by the time my hair dries. My hair is smooth, soft, silky and maintains this throughout the day. It also helps my waves come out a little bit. As a refresher on non wash days, its great to eliminate fly always and make it look like I actually tried. While I don’t heat style my hair often, I love that this is also a heat and yv protectant. The scent is not overwhelming (I’m usually pretty sensitive) and my hair does not get greasy or stringy. Will repurchase once its used up!"

From the very first use, I noticed a remarkable difference in my hair's texture and manageability. Not only did it instantly deliver an incredible 86% boost in hydration, but it also worked wonders in taming frizz, even in the most humid conditions. One of the standout features of this product is its versatility. Not only does it protect my hair from the high heat of styling tools, but it also shields it from the sun's drying effects, making it perfect for year-round use. And let's talk about the fragrance—it's absolutely divine and leaves my hair smelling fresh all day long. What really sets this primer apart is its ability to cater to different hair types and conditions. Whether you have fine, medium, or thick hair, curly or straight, it seems to adapt effortlessly, providing the right level of hydration and smoothing without ever feeling heavy or greasy. I also appreciate that it helps preserve my hair color, keeping it vibrant for up to 16 washes. And the fact that it detangles my hair, reducing breakage, is an added bonus. I love how easy it is to incorporate into my daily routine, whether on damp hair for styling or on dry hair for a quick refresh. In short, the Hairdresser's Invisible Oil Primer is a true multitasker that not only lives up to its claims but surpasses them. If you want soft, smooth, and beautifully hydrated hair with less frizz, this product is an absolute must-have!"

Contrary to the name, this oil primer isn't oily at all. It goes on smoothly, and absorbs well into the hair. There is definitely some softening going on as well, but it does not weigh down my hair. That's something very important for users who have short hairstyles. I'd recommend that you give this a go if you've similar hairstyling needs as me."

Adding it before heat styling is nice too, I can feel that is adds a bit of slip to my hair and my curls aren't dragged down by it. My blow out does seem much sleeker and stays a bit longer with it in. It doesn't have a strong scent, which I much prefer, and a little goes a long way for me (short hair, medium coarse, medium porosity)"

To top it all off this product is also a heat protectant up to 450 degrees.  I’ve noticed significantly less dehydration and smoother hair follicles when I use this product. I plan to always have it on hand, it’s a hair classic!  I received this product as a free sample. All opinions are my own."

I use it after washing my hair, before blow drying. Then I can also use it in between washes when my hair is feeling dull or dry. It's miracle oil! This product is amazing. I have to admit I was hesitant because it has the word oil in it. But if you just take a small amount and rub it through the ends of your hair when it's still wet it's soaks right in and when you blow dry your hair your hair remain soft but still can hold a curl. It smells good and your hair does not look oily or greasy at all after use. I surprisingly loved it and this product will become part of my regular hair routine. It may seem pricey, but a little bit goes a LONG way! The bottle has lasted me awhile and I'm nowhere near empty (Although I do not use it everyday). It is lightweight, it does not make my hair feel greasy, dirty, or weighed down. It does what it's supposed to! I have very frizzy hair, but this helps sleek it out giving it a nice shine. I also love that it doubles as a heat protectant and UV protectant. It also smells lovely. Although I will not need to for awhile, I will definitely be re-purchasing this product!"

I feel like it’s very waxy looking and feels like I left conditioner in my hair. I was excited at first cause the mist is really fine unlike others that come out like a serum. It smells nice but almost like a clean toasted coconut. My hair looks less frizzy but I feel like it’s because it’s a layer of product sitting on top. Maybe I need to use less, I’m going to try it a few more times before I give up on it. But definitely keep your receipt if you but this just incase you need to take it back. Maybe brush your hair and then apply in sections and do slightly less on top. I’m going to also try it on dry hair and see how it does. Fingers crossed cause I really wanted to love this."

My favorite way to use it is on its own, when my hair is damp: it detangles, makes it look healthier (the product absorbs more than when used on dry hair) and I don’t need to style it. This product also protects from sun damage (perfect for the summer) and is incredible when used as a heat protectant (before styling with hot tools): my hair is bouncy, more natural and has that « just got back from the hairdresser » subtle shine.

I have very dry hair from years of bleaching and tried many products that claim to protect but never found one that actually did until this one. I use it before I apply heat to my hair and I can tell the biggest difference. It makes my hair not only look smooth and moisturized but I can actually feel the difference. The UV protection is an amazing thing to have as well as we all tend to forget to protect our hair from UV damage."

I have fine, thin med length highlighted hair that gets damaged and frizzes easily, plus an oil prone scalp. I get it highlighted every 3 months, and have to wash every 2-3 days. So its VERY hard to find hair product that add moisture/protection without being too heavy, sticky or making it greasy. On damp hair (not too dry, not soaking wet either) I spray ~4 pumps in my hand, rub together and work through the mid length through ends, and just a delicate patting of it on the top and front of my hair, then comb through. Too much on the top will prob make it greasy and limp. Ive noticed its UV protection is amazing. My hair color usually gets muddy/oxidizes from too much sun, but this protects it and keeps the blonde bright longer than ever. I usually dont heat style, usually just a quick paddle brush blow dry when its like 80% dry. It seems to be a decent heat protectant for blow drying. I spritz a bit of a different heat protectant just on the ends if i use hot tools."

It’a basically weightless and feels like nothing on the hair. I live in a very dry climate and I enjoyed using this as my hair felt less dry. Sometimes I have to skip hair conditioner because it can weigh down my hair so I like using it as an alternate to that.

			"review_text": "I've always had historically great experiences with Bumble & Bumble products, so I was very excited to try this primer. While I don't use heat on my hair, I do roll and set it at night, and I spend a lot of time outside - so I was very happy to find a product that helps with UV protection as I color my hair red. What I love about this product is that it's super easy to evenly apply to the hair since it's a spray, and about 4 sprays is plenty to apply to the ends of my long hair when it's wet. The next day, I like spraying about 2 pumps into my hands and running it through the ends for extra hydration and shine. This primer makes my hair noticably less frizzy, and way more shiny and soft, but it also doesn't weigh my hair down (hair is somewhat fine). I think this is a great pick if you are looking to protect your hair from heat/UV, cut frizz, amplify shine, and boost hydration. I also feel like my hair dries faster when I use this. Honestly, it's everything I look for in a product! Highly recommend."

I always think about heat protecting it when I’m styling it but not when I’m out in the sun. Definitely would recommend this!"

What I appreciate so much about this product is that it protects my hair, including the Demi-permanent dye I currently have on it, while I’m outside in the hot sun!  Hair is not comprised of living skin cells, so it doesn’t need the traditional UV filters that we put on our skin. Instead, it needs ingredients that will neutralize the impact of the free radicals released in UV rays (this is why you don’t see an SPF rating on this, in case anyone wondered!)  It’s very easy to use and seems to help my hair in looking more shiny and healthy, even with sun exposure. Well done!"

Either way, this is the Ultimate go to for all hair types, frizziness and UV protectant! The scent is a fresh, clean and almost floral hint as you blow-dry. I found when I let my hair airdry that the scent lasted longer, and it smells just like Summer Vacation! The fact that it can detangle my blonde hair had me sold immediately!

I also found out by accident it even helps my hair look nice if I don’t do anything but let it air dry. And it makes second day hair a breeze: I just wet it down, spray a little bit of this in it and dry with the diffuser. FINALLY.

I found myself wishing the scent lasted longer but I love that it didn’t weigh my hair down or make it feel sticky!   My only real “complaint” is I felt like my hair was harder to style on day 4-5 compared to when not using the product. It was fine when I first straightened it on day 2 hair, but my hair eventually lost that straightness and became more curly/wavy, especially underneath and closest to my neck. When I went to re-straighten it, my hair took longer to style and it felt like it was harder to work the straightener through my hair.   I will say my toddler has curly hair and I spritzed this in her hair to refresh her curls and it worked really well!   Overall, I’m going to stick to only spritzing the top layer of my hair moving forward but I’ll definitely continue using it on my daughters, as well!"

My husband used it on his ends and I used it from midway down. It isn’t greasy or heavy on either of us and products do tend to get heavy on my hair. Lastly I’ll say, this smells amazing! My husbands words were “smells like a clean salon!”"

So I started looking for better, more expensive heat protectants, and this one came up in so many recommendations.   First of all, one thing that I noticed about this product is that it is much more fairly priced compared to others like it. While it's expensive compared to drugstore products, compared to its other high-end brand competitors, such as the Kerastase Resistance Ciment Thermique Blow Dry Primer (which goes for $37 for 5.1oz) or the Oribe Balm D'or Heat Styling Shield (which is $45 for 3.4oz), this is a steal at $29 for 8.5oz.  And the thing is, with this product, you really don't need a lot. I have thick hair, and I probably use about 10 sprays before blowdrying, and less than that before straightening my hair, since I don't want my hair to be too wet before straightening it.  After blowdrying, this spray leaves a lustrous sheen all over my hair, and tames any flyaways/breakage that I'd usually have without using the spray. My hair feels so soft after using it, and it also smells so good - it's sweet but not cloying, like a light vanilla. The scent also lasts for quite a while, which was a nice surprise!   I also use this product before straightening my hair, but you can't use too much before straightening, because it can make dry hair feel a bit tacky if you use a lot. I just use around 7 to 8 sprays, and that's good enough to leave my hair looking shiny and healthy with minimal flyaways, which is a miracle after straightening it at over 400 degrees Fahrenheit (which is what I have to do to get my thick hair to straighten).  Ultimately, if you're looking to make the step up from drugstore heat protectants/primers to something a little more expensive but still affordable (which I strongly suggest you do), THIS is the product is that I'd suggest, for any and all hair types."

			"review_buyer_description": "Hazel eyes, brown hair, Light skin tone, Combination skin",
			"review_text": "The Good: I got to review quite a lot of products from this line over the last few months in large-ish sample sizes. I somehow acquired 2-3 minis of this and loved the product enough to purchase a full-size of this after I ran out. I also want to point out this is the ONLY product from the invisible oil line that I felt was good enough for me to repurchase it. I'm extremely impressed with this primer, it's more of a thicker and milkier formula in comparison to a misty dry-oil spray like most primers come in. At first I thought I would hate it for that reason, but it's actually fantastic! I have natural curly and fine hair that sometimes gets frizzy especially due to weather factors and oily consistencies in primers can oftentimes make my hair simply look oily and unwashed. This is the perfect solution to this. I also love using this as primer under heat styling products, it doesn't make my hair overly wet (unless I overdo it) and it's easy to comb through. It doesn't sizzle when damp under heat styling tools like many other water based primers tend to do and there's no gross scent after the heat touches your hair with this on. The overall scent on this product is very nice, vibrant and light. I had a former go-to primer but I tend to reach for this one more simply due to the fact that it doesn't make my hair oily even if I accidentally over-do it (unlike the other primer). This is the sample I ran out of first despite having multiples of it and truly the star of the invisible oil line from Bumble and Bumble. Skip the other products and try this one first.   The Bad: The nozzle on this is subpar and can spray funky sometimes both in my regular size and the mini bottles. For the price it sells for I believe the spray nozzle could and should be better.   The Ugly/Honest: I think this product is a bit overpriced (as seems to be the theme in bumble and bumble products) however, it IS a good product. I deducted one star due to the spray nozzle and high price point."

I like it for the UV protection and heat protection as I defuse my hair about 2-3 a week. I probably wouldn’t buy it again, I need something more creamy. I found my actually curl cream did better to detangle my hair better than this. I think it would be an amazing product for people that don’t have curly hair and don’t actually have to detangle the way I do. It’s very lightweight and doesn’t make the hair greasy."

I have the issue that it looks great at first, then quickly becomes frizzy the second a singular drop of moisture or sweat happens. It's impossible. But this stuff makes my hair smooth and bouncy and shiny, it's just incredible. The other day I blew out my hair and went to work through a foggy mist, so I fully anticipated my hair would lose that bounce and shine and become frizzy. NOPE.

I have long colored hair with dry ends, and this slightly helps prevent fading of my color- I think color protecting shampoos, reducing hair washing to 2-3x a week, and avoiding sun exposure are all more effective. This has a milky consistency, so it distributes well- I only need 3-4 sprays to cover my very long hair. The smell isn’t too overpowering or artificial; it’s vanilla with honeysuckle. Unless you concentrate the product at your ends, it won’t condition dry ends as well as heavier products. I recommend layering a cream based product over split/dry ends. Great value for the price. One bottle has lasted me one year even though I use it 3 times a week."

I was hoping this product would help the dry ends so my hair style can last longer between washes. So far, it leaves my hair feeling AMAZING immediately — but within minutes after the product dries my hair is left dry and tangled.

It is not overly expensive and lasts a long time for me I used it every day and it lasted me about six months. The only downside to this product is that if you have thinner hair like me it does tend to wear your hair down.This product is meant for medium to thick hair but I still use it anyways because I love the smell. Hopefully they will make a similar one for thinner hair types."

I can’t imagine not using it since it really smoothes and lightly conditions my very coarse, porous hair. I also use the actual B and B oil in the orange bottle also on days I don’t shampoo. That is phenomenal as well. I’ve tried EVERY silicone product for ends after drying, and that is the only one that actually softens my hair and works. I’m 50 yo and always have had wavy/curly/frizzy hair. I’ve spent thousands on trying to formulate a routine. Washing only 2 times a week helps, but I can’t imagine life without this product, the orange bottled oil, and the shampoo. It’s worth the cost."

It helps with detangling slightly and I feel like when I blow dry my hair and then wave it with a straightener it helps maintain my style.   It makes me hair appear a bit thicker and fuller (not sure if the products coat your stands), but I love the look it gives. This is what I love about it most.   It smells good, but I am a bit weary of inhaling the fumes so I try to not breathe it in. My only wish was that this product was clean - if it was fully clean and didn't worry about what I was breathign in, I would give it 5 stars!   When I air dry my hair and spray it in, I don't notice a massive difference with frizz. Perhaps it's a touch more moisturizing, but overall I prefer using this product before heat styling.   I'd re-purchase this product."

So basically I’m a unicorn because almost all curly hair leave in/ moisturizers are made for THICK curly hair that needs oils and moisture like an Irish man needs beer on St. Paddy’s Day. Keep it coming status. If I use stuff like that on my hair it looks greasy and weighed down, instantly, even if I use just a small amount of product. So I need a detangler/leave in/ heat protectant (yes I diffuse and straighten when I feel like, so sue me). I. Tried. It. All. I could not find one product to do everything I needed until I happened to see this recommended quite a few times on different forums for leave in hair products. First of all, I know it’s expensive. But second of all, and more importantly IT’S WORTH IT. My wet combs goes through my hair so well with just three sprays on each half head of hair (I’m lazy and literally just section right down the middle and call it a day). Great detangler. As for leave in conditioner it makes my hair so soft!!!! WITHOUT WEIGHING IT DOWN WHATSOEVER. Which anyone with fine hair will tell you is sooooo important. Great leave in conditioner. And when I use heat my hair stays very soft and manageable and after using this product for a couple months my hair doesn’t seem to be suffering from heat damage like it normally did before using this product. Great heat protectant. This also is a great base because as a curly girl I layer products like no ones business! So. Bottom line. If you’re in the market for a leave in, or a detangler, or a heat protectant, look no further and give this baby a try. Plus it smells amazing! Win win win win!"

I like that it's small and good for travel. It smells great, seemingly morphing little by little with each use. Overall it makes me think of the beach (coconut) and viva la juicy perfume. I think it adds a little volume/texture but leaves my hair a little less sleek and doesn't define my curls as much as this other product:Totex 2 Phase Argan Oil Conditioning spray. I bought the Totex from a salon which was $21 for 13oz (big bottle!). The B&B product is $13 for 2oz. While it was nice to try and I will continue to periodically use it until I finish the bottle, it is a no-brainer for me to stick to my Totex spray."

I can tell it helps and protects my hair from the damage done by the heat. The primer has a nice spray and a nice fragrance.

It smells great and I think I’m going to move to this from Olaplex No. 6 since this offers heat and UV protection! Love it!"

It's also quite light-weight, and I can use it throughout if I do so sparingly. Only thing is, I have **exceptionally fine hair,** and it does feel a bit tacky if it's sprayed too much. The Sephora staff member who sold it to me knew that it was worth the hype, but didn't seem to understand that it's intended for medium to thick hair. Overally, I had enough of a positive experience with this to try a different Bb primer specifically for thin hair."

This product is a game changer! It doesn’t leave your hair oily, effectively detangles after showering, even fine hair like mine. My ends look hydrated and fresh and healthy.   It smells very strong and sweet, so I took off a star for that. I associate really strong smelling products with cheap stuff that’s marketed to teenagers.

I used this on my dry hair after I brushed it and hadn’t washed it for a couple days, it made my hair smell great for longer than just a couple hours and it also tamed the poofyness. I would definitely recommend this for people who don’t want to wash their hair everyday but still need to brush it to tame it, buuuut at the same time have wavy/curly hair (if you know, you know- #wavyhairproblems). I’m giving four stars because I did notice a slight residue on my hair the next day that made it feel a bit heavy, nothing that would stop me from using the product but I think worth noting for people who don’t want that. It could probably be avoided by using less product. But overall would recommend!"

I do not use this on days that I wash my hair and let it air dry unless my hair is knotted 2. If I wash my hair and blow-dry it, I will blow dry my hair a little, then pull my hair to the side and spray once on the ends only. I’ll comb the product through with my fingers and use the excess on my fingers throughout the rest of my hair. I let it work it’s magic for about 5 minutes and then continue to blow dry 3. On days that I don’t wash my hair and my ends look dry, I will spray once from about 3/4 down my hair to the ends of my hair 4. I absolutely LOVE this as a heat protectant before I curl my hair. I will spray it on my ends, detangle with my fingers, and use the product on my fingers in the rest of my hair. Let it sit for about 5 minutes and then curl my hair  Hope this helps!"

Using this along with some supplements my hair dresser noted that my hair looks and feels thicker and healthier. I use this primer after every wash and before drying and styling my hair.

It's not a miracle worker, but it does the job well enough that if nothing else worked better I'd go back to this product. It definitely can feel a little heavy sometimes and make my hair oily faster, but it does well to protect the hair (IMO) before a blowdry. Though I do wish it worked better on dry hair before styling. I've never used any BB products, and I know this one is all the rage (Lol) but I don't see it as a perfect solution, rather, good paired with other products and used lightly. Overall I like it, and I'm not super impressed, but I'd recommend it for anyone needing a little help with their ends as it helped protect my ends from further damage paired with other oils!

The formula is light that it doesn't weigh down my thin hair, but it still covers it and protects my hair from the blow dryer. I took a star off because you need at least 4-5 spritzes for medium length hair that is shampooed every other day - basically the product dwindles quickly."
