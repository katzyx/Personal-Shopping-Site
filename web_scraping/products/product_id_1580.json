			"review_text": "I really love the convenience of lotion-based tanners so this is great for me! It works quickly and leaves an instantly noticeable colour! However, beware that this product is not travel-friendly so it doesn't leave the house with me, which is a huge bummer considering the convenience of the application. I took this on vacation and thank goodness I secured it in a ziploc bag because it leaked on the way there, and back even after feeling like I did everything I could to secure it."

			"review_text": "I NEVER EVER write reviews, because who’s got the time? Plus there hasn’t been any product that has deserved a review. At least a positive review! But wow this tanning lotion. I, like many girls love to tan, but don’t want the damage of tanning beds and laying under the sun. I’ve used many different tanning lotions and always have the same issue: 1. The product is not dark enough or natural 2. I have to leave it on for hours, and they ALWAYS stain my sheets and clothes 3. Are streaky or fade streaky 4. They’re sticky and annoy me all day so I end up washing it before it gets to the level I want.  Now this tan lotion from tan luxe 1. I don’t even have to exfoliate my skin before I apply and it still goes on streak free 2. The texture is amazing, it allows me to blend it perfectly and don’t have to rub it in for long before it gets absorbed 3. Within 2 hours I’m noticeably darker and the next day very tanned 4. It stays on for a while without fading and it fades very gradually and without getting patchy 5. You only need to use a little to see results. 6. It smells great when you apply, as it develops it has only the mildest hint of tanning lotion, and it’s not sticky as it dries. I’m curious to try the tanning drops for the face."

Not streaky and the fake tan smell is not there. It is a very liquid product so it does take getting used to. My skin feels so hydrated when I have it on."

			"review_text": "Gives a nice subtle tan/glow but it does have a strong self tan scent. Seems minimal when first smelling/applying but the scent ends up getting stronger as the tan develops. Also the tan takes about 6 hours to start developing rather then the 2 it says on the bottle. The formula is very liquidy which I actually like since it dries down very quickly. Overall a good purchase if you like gradual tanners and don’t mind the self tan scent."

If you rub it in good enough there will be no streaks or missed spots. I love this tanner and will keep buying it forever. I’m very white and it looks amazing, not too dark at all and takes a minute to dry so you can go on with your day"

			"review_text": "Not necessarily gradual but still a lovely self tanner. Constancy is fluid which makes it easy to get an even thin application. Doesn’t smell overly “self tanner” like which is nice. I would caution to treat this less like a drugstore daily-self-tan-lotion and more like a proper self tanner especially in regards to skin prep, moisturizing dry spots and careful application. Overall really happy with it."
