			"review_text": "This face wash is so gentle, soothing, yet effective at cleansing the skin. This cleanser cleared up some acne I was having and it has made my skin look so much smoother and brighter. The texture on my face has drastically improved.  I use the make up eraser cloth to remove my make up, and I use this cleanser afterwards to follow up. It works perfectly! My face hasn't been this clear and smooth in a long time.   I also own the Acne Clearing Face Wash by Dermalogica as well, and I want to say that the special cleansing gel formula actually works better for acne and skin texture. I'll be buying this one from now on.  It is pricey, but this is definitely the best basic (but not so basic) face wash I've ever used. My skin never feels tight or dry after using either. Definitely worth it and the bottle lasts a long time. Would highly recommend!   I purchased these products with my own money, this is not a sponsored review."

What were they thinking?! I read on Reddit from a dermatologist that they decided not to work with them because they were changing their formulas to sell products at Target. So I guess they are putting cheaper ingredients in some of their products, so that they can sell it for cheaper. I am now having a hard time finding a new product that doesn't make me break out. It took me a long time before I was able to find this cleanser."
