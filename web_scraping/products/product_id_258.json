	"how_to_use": "Suggested Usage:..Dipping Method: ..-Pour, dip, and then wipe: these three easy steps are all it takes to clean makeup brushes. ..-Pour the Makeup Brush Cleaner into the Cleansing Tin enough to dip a quarter of the way up the brush bristles. ..-Dip brush tip into the liquid and remove immediately to avoid oversaturation. Bristles will draw liquid up into brush and dissolve away makeup. ..-For large fluffy or dense brushes, only dip 10 percent of the brush tip, and hold it vertically for five seconds so that liquid moves down into the base. ..-Wipe clean on an absorbent paper towel or cloth. Repeat as necessary. ..-Shape brushes and allow to air dry completely before using..... Precautions:..-Flammable: Keep away from open flame. ..-Do not swallow, and avoid contact with skin and eyes. ..-If swallowed, do not induce vomiting and seek medical attention. ..-Keep out of reach of children.",

I don’t smell any vanilla fragrance as sited in the description The directions say no water needed, air dry. Using a ton of paper towels (my brushes were pretty dirty though 🙃) just doesn’t work for me. I did rinse with water to keep from using a bunch of paper towels & I didn’t want to leave my brushes to dry with the  gasoline/lighter fluid smell I’ll finish using the travel size but won’t purchase anymore bc of the smell & potential use of numerous paper towels"

My only issue is there is a scent from the product that lingers on the brushes. It is pleasant, vanilla scented, but this might deter some who are sensitive to scents from using the product.

I had to put my brushes on a rag on an open window sill for 24 hours to let them air out because the smell was taking over my apartment. Otherwise, love that it's a small size -- great for discovery if you're unsure about going all in on the bigger size. The little tin is very handy so you don't have to find and use something from your household to pour the solution in."

I basically bought this because it was getting a bit much washing my brushes with soap and water after every single use. So now this gives me some what of a break. This product will never replace a good ole soap and water wash but it’s great to use in between soap and water washes."

Reviews are correct that it does have a very strong smell however as a previous nail technician, it smells the same as acrylic plomer to me so I don’t mind. If you have a sensitive nose you will hate this no matter how good it is. I just ordered the large as I ran out already because I have a lot of brushes and this was just a trail for me. Dries fast. No water needed. Never using anything else. Definitely got me for life. Oh and it took off 6 months of product with ease. I know gross right but with COVID who I wearing makeup 24/7? Not me! So I didn’t bother to clean them and didn’t use them either by it was gross. So happy they ate clean now. Now back to beating my face."

However, my Sephora Pro brushes don't seem to have lost any hair. The smell is ok, like a vanilla solvent, but it stays even after my brushes are dry. Even if I just tip the tip of the bristles, it saturates up to the base and is hard to remove without. My brushes have kindof hardened after drying with this solution. They still work well, I'll most likely continue using it."

			"review_text": "This is the truth about this stuff. This will 100% clean your brushes and it's super convenient. You dip your brush into the tin about 1/4 of the way and quickly pull it out. Then just wipe it on a towel for a while, and it's dry in like 15 minutes. It's great at removing pigment, and I really love it. I only use it for eye brushes so a little goes a long way. Most of the downvotes on this product will be for the smell. Imagine what nail polish remover smells like and how it consumes all of the air. That's what this does. It smells like a heavy duty cleaner, which it is. It doesn't bother me, but if you have issues with fragrance, don't even try this product because using it will probably give you a headache.  Now, the only reason I didn't give this five stars is because every once in a while, some of my brushes dislike this product. I have sigma, BH, and colourpop brushes. The BH brushes really enjoy this stuff and do pretty well. Colourpop + sigma can be a bit more finicky. Every once in a while, I'll use this stuff and my brushes will be left stiff (like when you forget to soak a used paintbrush). However, this has happened less and less as I've used it. I think the key is to really ensure you are getting all the product off the brush when rubbing it on the towel (do little circles, really make sure it's off) and try to massage them a little while drying. Last time I used it, my fluffy colourpop brush splintered/stiffened a little and I was very unhappy. HOWEVER, I cleaned it again today and was much better about really just taking a minute to get all the product off. And now my brush is back to it's normal self, no more splintering, and it's softer and working much much better. So, just be diligent about your washing."

Swirl it on a hand towel and should be good to go. I bought the bigger bottle of this but this tiny one"

After I finished I noticed the bristles of my bronzer blush were warped and better yet not even all of the bronzer had been cleaned. You're paying a premium to dip your brushes into what smells like hand sanitizer mixed with vanilla perfume, it is only moderately effective at its actual purpose and there's a good chance you will ruin your brushes using it. There are so many better products then this, spend your money elsewhere!"

This brush cleaner does have an ethanol scent but bacteria doesn't exactly go away by itself and at least they tried to mask the scent with vanilla. I cleaned four brushes and it used up about half the bottle, so this would be good for travel but also just to see how the product works. Remember to follow the directions because you don't want the product seeping into the base of the brush (where the handle and the brissles meet) because that could mess up the glue that holds your brush together. Overall this product worked great! I'm just giving it four stars because I swear it used to cost eight dollars and they bumped it up to ten. For what reason, idk. ❤"

It's perfect for sanitizing brushes between clients, because it cleans quickly without a need to rinse, but may be excessive for personal use. Make sure you follow the directions and just dip your brushes in the tin, don't oversaturate your brushes and make sure to wipe them down immediately. This tin is too small for larger brushes, so if you need to use this with larger brushes, you should get the larger tin, but you can also just use a small bowl or ramekin if you don't want to purchase a larger tin. This is the perfect size for travel or keeping in a makeup kit, but if you're just going to keep it at home, probably get the bigger sizes."

The fibers of your brush will pick up and use capillary action to travel to the top. As for any other disinfectant cleaner, of course it is going to have a smell. If you are sensitive to smell, this may not be for you. It can leave blue color in your brush depending on the fiber composition. Most of mine were fine and one got the slightest hue of blue. I’m not a professional that spends hundreds of hard earned dollars on brushes though. Use with caution especially if the brush is older. Very effective. Buying the big bottle next."

I don't mind it overall. I would recommend rinsing your brush after using this though to dull the scent.  This is a tiny bottle, it didn't last for the 40  brushes I have. the tin also. I do understand its a travel set so thats on me. I would recommend buying this smaller option first, because of the smell mostly."

Definitely worth enduring the smell for a few minutes.  I just properly washed my entire brush collection for the first time since discovering Cinema Secrets and it took only half of the time and I went twice as long as I normally do.

DO NOT dip the brush in all the way up to the ferrule—only dip the very tip of the brush into the cleaner. The cleaner will soak up into the bristles to effectively clean them. Then gently wipe the brush on a paper towel or old washcloth until clean. I LOVE how quickly the bristles dry; I can use the brush a few minutes after cleaning!

I’m fairly sure they’ve either done a terrible job of changing the scent or it’s basically made of paint thinner.  2. I went through it way too quickly. This particular size is just way too small to be worth any money. You’re better off getting a brush shampoo and just washing your brushes.

I had an eye infection recently so I wanted to find a brush cleaner that actually cleans and disinfects rather than just wash off the makeup. This worked really well and my brushed dried very quickly. It does have a bit of a fragrance to it, but it's much better than smelling alcohol, which is what I used after my eye infection. Plus this is much gentler on your brushes than using rubbing alcohol."

I guess I got used to it over time.  I love this product because it does the job and does it QUICKLY.  My only gripe is that I can’t really use my bigger brushes because it absorbs way too much cleaner.  This cleaner is great for small brushes but not for something big and dense.  It’ll drink up way too much cleaner and you really only need a little amount.  So far, this has been my go-to cleaner because it works quickly to get all the color and grime off the bristles.  It is still recommended to deep clean all your brushes with water and a good soap but this cleaner is awesome when you don’t have the time or patience."

So I tested the product and here are the true results....if you follow the directions and I mean to the T...you will love this product.  After you follow the cleaning directions, you will find that your brushes smell kind of like gasoline; however, your brushes are not truly dry. Let them dry over night. I washed over 20 brushes in less than 5 minutes before bed and let them dry over night. Next morning, my brushes are completely dry, the smell of gasoline is gone and they brushes are clean for my face.  I followed as directed and I did end up with one brush with a slight blue tint, but that was 1 out of 20. It may just be the type of brush hairs. Though if you want to try the results for yourself, you really can't go wrong with the travel size.  Hope my review was helpful. :)"

I spray it directly on the top of the bristles and swipe until clean, it takes about 20 secs to dry. 2nd way using the tin, and dipping my brush 10 to 15% and it will soak up like a wike and sweep it on a soft towel or paper towel until it's back to brand new!"

Just barely dip in the very top of your brush and it will pull plenty of product up into the bristles. I always be sure to keep my brushes facing down as to not allow the product to absorb into the glue that binds the bristles. I then use a clean washcloth to wipe the brushes back and forth until my brush is clean. I do rinse my washcloth clean with hot water afterward, and wring out excess water, then take my brushes again over the washcloth to remove the excess product left behind, because it can leave a powerful smell of a vanilla-ish alcohol type odor behind. I would not think that alcohol could be good for the brush as it may very the bristles out. By doing it this way,  my brushes get brand new looking and do not dry out. Hope this review helps."

I especially love it for foundation and concealer brushes, which are usually quite difficult to clean. The effect is stunning on lighter shade brushes' bristles. I am not so happy about big fluffy powder brushes with long bristles - it looks like the cleaner does not climb high enough to head, but maybe I will change my mind after buying a bigger size tin. I am definitely rebuying this in bigger size, but if I won't see a big difference for big brushes, I will look for additional cleaner for them."

It restored the original white colour of my brush tips and even softened my eyeliner brushes that had gotten hard due to dried up product.  The cleanser tin on the other hand feels really cheaply made, and mine actually leaks when I use it (the product seeps through the bottom, I'm not sure how or why). So not only is it wasting the product, but it's also a waste of money.   I don't see any point in buying the tin, just pour a little bit out into a bottle cap and use that instead of paying additional money.  The major complaint I've seen is the scent, I didn't find it to be too intolerable and after it dries it leaves a perfumey vanilla scent. But it definitely smells like hand sanitizer at first."

It reminds me of licorice together with cotton candy and as tasty as that may sound it's not something I find pleasant to have a perfume smell left on my brushes.

I have acne prone skin so I used to shampoo and condition my brushes and then spray with rubbing alcohol. The alcohol would disinfect  and help with a quicker dry but would mess up my bristles. When I looked up best and quickest drying brush cleaners this came up in my search.   The way it is advised to be used does waste some product especially on smaller brushes so I only use the capillary method for my foundation brushes because they touch most of my acne prone areas. For the rest of my brushes like, lip, eyeshadow, brow, etc., I pour the cleaner into a spray bottle and directly spray the smaller brushes and swirl on a lint free paper towel. I haven't broken out from this product. It does have a strong chemical smell but it subsides after a while and becomes this vanilla-marshmellowy smell.   Placing this in a small spray bottle enables me to use the right amount of product, and keep all my brushes clean on-the-go."

Also, the smell. It's not horrible, but it is a chemical smell, slightly sweet. I don't 100% mind, since it is the smell of intense cleaning, but I hope it doesn't stay in the brush after it dries.
