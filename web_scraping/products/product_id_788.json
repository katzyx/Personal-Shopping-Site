	"how_to_use": "Suggested Usage:.-Like perfume or eau de toilette, cologne is a fragrance designed to be worn on the skin..-Spritz generously onto your wrists, neck, and pulse points—your body heat will help to diffuse the scent as the day goes on..-After applying your cologne, avoid rubbing or dabbing skin. This breaks down the fragrance, causing it to wear off more quickly.  .-If you prefer placing fragrance on your wrists, be sure to reapply after frequent handwashing, as this tends to rinse off the scent. .-Replace your fragrance after 12 months. Expired perfumes more than a year old lose the integrity of the original scent.",
