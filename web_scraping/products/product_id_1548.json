I love the smell of it as well as the applicator; it's so good that I don't even need to look into the mirror to apply it on my lips. However, I find that it doesn't last very long, which is such a shame because it has a great texture and feel! Since it doesn't last too long, that also means that I didn't notice any change in my lips. They weren't necessarily dryer, but they didn't feel deeply moisturized. If you are looking for a lip balm for deep moisture, I don't think this is it. But if you want a balm that leaves a sheer tint and an amazing glossy finish, then this is the perfect product for you!"

I like the variety of flavors and scents, the viscosity is thick but not sticky where hair clings to it, and it has the perfect amount of tint.  However, I still find it lacking when it comes to actually hydrating the lips. I can feel my lips becoming drier, and it feels like this product is just retaining the moisture that is already there, instead of hydrating my lips and leaving them better nourished or conditioned. For products in similar price ranges, I would much rather have the Eadem, Ole Henriksen, or Tatcha. All of those products leave my lips feeling plush and better than initial application. Even lower cost brands like Neutrogena have better balms when it comes to improving the texture and appearance of the lips over this product."

It is not good for people with defy lips and not good for lip care but it is super pretty to go with makeup and has a nice consistency. I did find it dries out my lips but I would still reccomend as a makeup product not a lip care product"

			"review_text": "'Birthday Cake' was my first (and favorite) offering from SF's various lip butter balms. Now that it's very difficult to get hold of, I've settled on what I believed to be the nearest match: Pink Sugar. The two share a similar vanilla/marshmallow fragrance and taste, with the biggest being that Birthday cake had a stunning iridescent shimmer to it, whereas Pink Sugar has none of that, instead it is pretty much clear, with just a hint of pink and (to me at least) tastes like icing! The scent is quite strong at first but dies down after a while. I do love the buttery texture which is neither too heavy/greasy, nor too light. My lips always feel well-conditioned during and after applying these, and never sticky. Having said that I still prefer Birthday Cake from the two and hope it's added to the permanent line up in the future. 'Cherry' - a sheer red which contains a lot more pigment than the aforementioned shades, is another firm favorite of mine.    ~ My Top 5 Beauty must-have list ~  1. Hair Loss Treatment: ‘Divine Herbal’ - Hair Oil  2. Shampoo: 'Sephora Collection' - Deep Cleaning Shampoo 3. Face Mask: ‘Peter Thomas Roth’ – Pumpkin Enzyme Mask  4.

For me sweet mint and pink sugar don’t show up on my lips pigment wise wise, which I love, but the cherry one is quite pigmented, but not too much for my taste and speaking about taste. The pink sugar tasted like a sweet sugar cookie sweeten tasted like a Tim Hortons candy, cane, hot chocolate 😢 😢 and Carrie tastes like your average artificial  cherry sent/taste. ￼lovewhich cherry sent/taste."

			"review_text": "FLAVOR: If you want a flavor of this lip balm that’s not a fruity one, definitely go with this one. The other vanillas and sugars have a weird underlying burnt plastic taste. The brown sugar however is YUMMY mhm, and the taste lasts too.  SMUDGING: As long as you let it set for a 20 minutes you can drink or eat and it won’t completely smudge on the straw. It lasts so long too, literally all day without too much activity and i apply it maybe 2-3 times a day if im busy. COLOR: The color is stunningly versatile too. It’s evenly pigmented and is subtle enough to look natural but bold enough to balance your face. SMOOTH: It is extremely smooth, it’s not buttery it is velvety mhmmm im in love. Only complaint is every time i put it on there is literally one grit. literally one single grit. its so weird but like pshhhhh whatever everythimg else is perfect MY OPINION: yas five stars i get the hype. Personally i would use this during the day and not as a nighttime moisturizer because it kinda crusts my lips overnight, im guessing cause its not getting reapplied. atm i have this and an olehenriksen lip balm which i use overnight. I’d definitely check out the olehenriksen if you want  a longer lasting and less gritty lip balm, but for daytime i love summer fridays"

Normally I wouldn’t have purchased such an expensive lip balm but the gift card made me feel like it was free. I tried it on and I was hooked. So much so that when I lost it at the movies I actually combed the theatre for it and called the m the next day to see if they found it after losing it only a few hours after getting it. I checked everywhere and eventually realized it wasn’t going to pop back up so I picked up a new one and paid out of pocket for it and I have to say it was worth it. I thought the tiktok girlies were lying but this stuff makes my lips feel so soft and I love the glossy look it gives it’s the perfect finishing touch to my makeup look. Plus it’s not super sticky or gloopy feeling just thick and nourishing with a touch of shine. i’m obsessed."
