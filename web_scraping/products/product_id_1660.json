			"review_text": "Amazing sunscreen! It doesn't irritate my sensitive skin at all, it's incredibly hydrating. And it's perfect to use out of the shower, just like a body lotion. I actually wear my sunscreen without issue daily where I was once upon a time very lax with my body sunscreen because I detested it so much. Smells like the beach too.  PLEASE start selling the big pump bottle you can get in Australia. I will buy it as a family staple."

Not heavy and sticky at all, feels dewy and light. The smell is faint and abit tropical but not strong. I love the smell and it’s not a sickly sunscreen smell. Overall I would definitely buy again I’m loving it!"
