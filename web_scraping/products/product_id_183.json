Also, the color was the perfect your lips, but better color. I have trouble finding colors that go with my complexion, so I was surprised when this particular lip product matched my natural lip color perfectly."

One of the standout benefits of owning this product is its long-lasting formula. Even after hours of wear, my lips remain hydrated and plump, with the color staying  vibrant throughout the day. Additionally, the creamy texture glides on effortlessly, ensuring smooth application every time.

The consistency is a bit stickier than I'm used to, since I don't wear a lot of lip gloss in general, but as far as lipglosses go, it's not that stick and it's pretty comfortable to wear. As far as the plumping aspect, I definitely feel a tingle when I put it on, nothing annoying, but it doesn't really do much for lip volume on me. Overall, it's a pretty color that I like to throw on when I feel like I just need a little color before leaving the house."

I liked the packaging. It’s chic and simple, almost with a frosted white tube. The doefoot applicator is standard average compared to other lip glosses.  The gloss itself is thick and sticky. In fact, it’s too sticky. I don’t like the texture at all. You feel the stickiness whenever you move your lips. This compares to a plumping gloss I used before in the past called Hard Candy Plumping Serum in Flower Child shade. The texture was very similar.  The plumping effect of the Dolly lip cream is fine. It tingles slightly on your lips when you put it on but it doesn’t burn or feel uncomfortable, even for me having extremely sensitive skin.  The shade Dolly is natural looking for me. I like the shade and the shine of the lip cream.  The Buxom plumping lip cream in Dolly shade does not compare to my Revolution Good Vibes Chilled Bomb Lip Oil or  all Makeup Revolution Makeup Revolution Pout Bomb Plumping Lip Gloss in Cookie shade. In my opinion, those lip glosses have a much better texture and consistency and thick, luxurious feel without the gross stickiness.  Overall, I thank BzzAgent and Buxom cosmetics for letting me participate in this campaign."

I love how thick this formula is, as it really stays in place and is able to last on your lips. I feel like it is a much thicker formula than the plump shot glosses, while still giving a nice plumping effect. Additionally, I think the plumping effect itself is less painful that the plump shot, so this is great for people who want a little less pain. It can be taken off, but while it is on it doesn’t try escaping your lips like other plumping glosses, and it has a much longer wear time than most. I love that this gives me a really nice flushed and glossy look to my lips. It’s a color that is natural enough for everyday use, but enough that it can also be used for glam days as well."

The plumping formula here gives your lips a little warm tingle that honestly feels nice and refreshing. I notice in a lot of plumping glosses that they hardly do anything for my upper lip- but with Buxom I find that it plumps that up significantly more. Overall I'm getting exactly what I want out of a plumping gloss, no pain and all gain!!  Gloss details: I'm picky about gloss finishes, don't want too sticky or too sheer and watery. I find the Buxom glosses to be exactly the formula I look for in a gloss. They are not sticky or goopy, not sheer, and actually last. This gloss is super rich and creamy, and will give you the same amount of pigment that you see in the tube. I like having a gloss with such good color payoff so if I'm in a rush, I know I don't have to layer and layer or put another lipstick under it in order to see the color.  No matter how many times I run out, I will always go back to Buxom!"

I applied the gloss, and was disappointed. Immediately.   It is not vibrant. The color is very translucent, almost like a clear lip gloss with a hint of pink shade to it. It is nothing like my favourite Marc Jacobs lip gloss was.   The texture is not slick, it is sticky. The tingle feature is decent, but barely noticeable.  Just disappointed all around."

Just this tingly feeling that honestly I don’t like. I would NOT recommend it."

It's not like I have Angelina Jolie lips or anything, but they're naturally pretty OK so I'm not too concerned about beefing them up. But I was interested in a really nice nude gloss and went with this one because I liked the color and if the plumping actually did work, well rad - gravy.  Unfortunately, the color is way off -- MUCH pinker than a nude should be (and definitely more than pictured). It basically looks like I'm wearing a soft, pastel pink. I expected something a little more on the beigier end (it looks much more beige than pink in the product photos). If I had to match the actual results, it looks more like Dolly than the Hot Toddy images.   As far as the plumping goes, absolutely no difference (as expected).   This is an absolute waste of money, I'm not happy at all."

I have to say that I like this better than I thought I would. I was scared the color would be too dark or be mulberry(which I hate) but the color was PERFECT against my natural lip color and skin color. The color looks like its natural. I didnt want something too bold or too sheer. The color was perfect.  Now for the “plumping” effect? Not too sure. Again, I did not buy this for bigger lips. I do not want bigger lips. I already heavily moisturize my lips constantly. If you go some time without moving your lips(talking or eating), your lips will smooth out on its own(like when you wake up in the morning). I put this on as a part of my full face makeup before work and since I rarely need to talk at work, there have been days where my lips do look very plump and seamless. On days where my lips move a little more, they look the same. But the color and sheen of the lip cream make my lips look better regardless.    Honestly, all a lip plumping lipgloss can do is pump your lips out to its natural capacity. It wont do anything extra. If you have super thin lips, dont expect this to do anything drastic. It has a nice formula but thats it. This was also my first time ever using a lip plumping product."

Pretty shade but do avoid if you’re longing as I am for a warm nude plumping gloss. Lawless forget the filler in George almost gets there despite being more mauve than advertised. The Lawless gloss is thicker, doesn’t feel as good on and isn’t as long-lasting as Buxom but it is more effective as a plumper. I own both and would honestly repurchase both. I just wish companies would get it together and take accurate swatch photos—no reason they shouldn’t be dead-on on a phone screen.."

			"review_text": "The Good: The Buxom formula provides a wonderful plumping effect, a light-medium pigmentation pay off and a minty effect. These are my go-to lip gloss formula and I use them as both topper and as stand-alone products. It's rare that I leave the house without wearing one of their colors on my lips. The color Sangria is the perfect color for those who love to rock a red lip. Whenever I wear a red liquid lipstick I usually top it off with some Sangria, not only does this add an extra oomph shine/plump to the lip it also provides a hydrating effect which can be much needed when using a liquid lippie. This color is perfect that it matches just about any red especially blue based reds, it certainly does not take away from any color I've used it with. I cannot imagine my red bold lip routine without topping it with this color, it's truly a god send and I always get complimented when I wear a red lip because of this. The best part, unlike other toppers this does not make my red liquid lippie bleed which is a god send. I will never stop repurchasing this product in this color, so perfect.   The Bad: As stated, color pay off on this is not highly pigmented. If you're looking for a super bold stand-alone red lip gloss, this is probably not it but it's still quite beautiful. Use alone this ranges from a very light red to a punky bold pink depending on how it's applied.   The Ugly/Honest: Pricey, but worth it."

			"review_text": "The Good: This is a wonderful formula that provides a medium level of pain-free plumping. The scent on this is the classic minty that Buxom is known for and it does leave a lightly minty feeling on the lips, in an enjoyable and pleasant type-of-way. I truly love this gloss, the consistency is not too thick or too running and the color smooths out very nicely yet can also be built up or worn as a topper. This is hands down the most versatile lip gloss on the market. This particular color French Martini is a wonderful mauvey-plum that packs a bit of a bold kick without being too out there for casual events or even the work place. It's truly stunning and I love wearing this under my mauvey liquid lippies and even bullet lipsticks. It's very rare that I don't wear a BUXOM gloss on my lips before leaving the house. Could not recommend more.   The Bad: The pigmentation on these is quite subtle and although I prefer that and it's ability to be buildable but also work as a topper, I can acknowledge that not everyone wants that kind of finish in a gloss.    The Ugly/Honest: The price point for these is quite hefty which means if you're a color collector (like myself) you'll end up shelling out a pretty penny for these. Once you own one, you're likely going to buy another (and another, and another). Proceed with caution. :)"

			"review_text": "The Good: I love BUXOM plumping lip creams/glosses and am very familiar with their formula. This is a pain-free plumping stunning gloss that delivers a beautiful luscious glow on the lips. I own them in almost every color that BUXOM has released and I don't plan on stopping. This truly is my all time favorite lip gloss. The formula scent is a bit minty and it also feels quite minty while on the lips, if that is not your sort of thing-these glosses may not be your favorite. I almost always use these glosses as a topper regardless of what lip stick I'm using and I also use them alone a good portion of the time. The colors always blend out nicely on the lips and aren't overly saturated with pigment so if you're looking for an intensely pigmented lip gloss-this might also not be for you. But for myself, this is perfect and serves amazingly as a gloss AND a topper because it does not take away from the other lippie I wear underneath and always adds something to it instead. This gloss always adds a slight but naturally beautiful plumping effect without being painful on the lips, which I really appreciate. Aside from the amazing formulation, the color Hot Toddy in particular is the perfect nude for my fair/light skin. It's not too intense, too dark, too light-it's truly the perfect nude and my go-to everyday lippie when I need a subdued color but also want my lips to look/feel amazing. Hot Toddy is the perfect shade for the office or to a business-type-of-event.   The Bad: Some people will not enjoy the subdued pigmentation on this lip gloss, I love it but I can see why some people would not after shelling out ~$20 on a gloss.   The Ugly/Honest: Despite being gorgeous glosses, these are quite expensive but in my honest opinion very worth their price point due to their amazing performance. I will continue to buy these in every color I think will suit me :)"

			"review_text": "10/10 this is the best lip gloss there is. Dolly is the perfect everyday “your lips, but better” shade (for my light, olive-toned skin). It ticks all of the boxes for the perfect lip product, with great lasting strength, color, & hydration.   The formula has really impressive lasting strength, up there with lipsticks. Plus, it does an amazing job of smoothing the texture of my lips. It gives a noticeable amount of beautiful shine, without any particles are glitter. It’s also perfectly hydrating, without being a gloopy/sticky mess. I went through 2 minis, before picking up a full-size. The mini-size lasted me months & months of daily wear, so the full-size will most likely last me a year.   The “plumping” effect isn’t what you would normally associate with a lipgloss. Most “plumping” glosses only make your lips look fuller using a “tingling” effect. With this gloss, it’s more in the impressive smoothing + hydrating aspect. It really does plump your lips, and make them appear full (opposed to pepper or whatever is normally in them).    The only thing I would consider a negative is the taste. If you accidentally lick your lips, it doesn’t have a very pleasant taste. Personally, I don’t mind it. It’s not gross, but it definitely doesn’t taste good. The scent, however, is pretty neutral.   One more thing to note is that I find this version (Lip Cream Gloss) isn’t tried as often as the Lip Polish Gloss. If you’re choosing between the two, I definitely recommend picking this version up first. So far, Dolly is the only shade I have tried (because I’m obsessed), but I plan on picking up Hot Toddy, Mudslide, Rose Julep, & Moscow Mule."

			"review_text": "Let me start off by saying that I don't wear lip color.  I've always had an aversion to it, because of how my mom's lipstick used to smell growing up, ha!  Also, I just don't like the feeling of something on my lips (even chapstick bugs me).  But, I do love the look of a nice gloss and how it finishes a look.  I used to buy MAC lipglass, and was never a fan of the texture.  They're slimy, sticky, leave a film after you've been wearing it awhile (mixed with saliva I guess, and just looks yuck), and the colors were a bit heavy/pigmented for me.  I recently found NARS, and was happy with it for just special occasions because the color was nice and soft, and wasn't as sticky as MAC.  I still never reached for it unless I had to.  Fast forward to recently.  I was browsing Sephora's site, and saw the many great reviews for this gloss.  Figured, why not.  I was at a store last weekend, and got the White Russian color.  Tried it on when I got home, and whattttt!  Not only did I love the color, but after wearing it for an hour, it just got better!  The White Russian color is perfect if you're not wanting pigment, but just want something soft to tone down your lips and just give that extra natural shine.  It's perfect if you do smokey eyes.  I have generally full lips (they're not wide, but they are medium sized but the top and bottom lips are full).  So, I was not looking specifically for something that plumps, but I will say, these give a teeny tiny plump that just makes your own lips look smoother and 'healthier'.  I don't notice a change in size or fullness that is noticeable to others.  The texture is sticky (to me), but it doesn't leave a film at all.  The tingle is refreshing!  It doesn't sting at all, but rather, just feels minty.  The minty feeling lasts around 20 minutes or so.  I've never loved a lip gloss (or anything lip product related), as much as I love this!  So much so, that I even like wearing it in the house!  Definitely give this a try!"

I would say that this product really works.  First off, I have never been conscious about how my lips look like until I had my most recent Gum tissue graft.  Being on liquid diet for 7 weeks when you're not great at hydrating in the first place made me realize just how my lips looked so dry that my lips looked older than my age!  This made my look at Sephora website and searched for lip products that will help my lips recuperate and look healthier.  I tried this Buxom plumping lip gloss and this paid off.  My lips really looked a lot healthier and a lot more hydrated.  From now on, I will be using this product more often in addition to hydrating a lot more!"

I don't think the minty menthol sensation does anything for plumping the lips. I noticed no discernible change in how plump my lips looked. The plumping effect comes primarily from the ultra glossy shine this gives - which is lovely - but far too sticky and thick.   In the end, unless you're dying for that menthol feeling on the lips, I think a cheaper gloss could do the same thing. I'll be returning this because I can't justify the price for meager color payoff, overly thick stickiness, and zero plumping effect."

It says not shiny and is definitely glossy. It says not sticky and I would have less goop on my lips if I rubbed a lollipop on them. Not impressed.

I wouldn’t say it’s sticky like some of the other reviewers say, but what it is does do it makes your lips feel like they’re burning on fire or if you had hot peppers on your lips. The tingle doesn’t go away. If you can handle that, it’s fine, but otherwise, it’s kind of a turn-off if you have really sensitive skin or lips because it does produce a very intense feeling.

			"review_text": "I've come to a phase in life where even creamy lipstick looked a bit too much and most glosses either looked too little or bizarrely shiny.  This stuff hits the sweet spot of colour and shine!  It is a bit sticky, but I forgive it because it is so amazing.  It does tingle a bit, not very much and not for long.  Pleasantly tastes like peppermint.  Product size is quite generous.  Colours are gorgeous.  Stays put and does not travel or bleed.  If you've been on the fence, seriously, try them.  I have both Cherry Flip and Kir Royal.  Both might look a bit daunting, but they are not.    Cherry looks very red on screen, comes out of the tube disappointingly pink and applies in two coats somehow as a clear, clean, apple red, and looks rather natural.  What sorcery is this?  I don't care, tbh.  It's an amazing colour, and as a bonus, my teeth look extra white when I wear it.  I never thought I'd pull off red again - but I can.  Kir Royale looks like you'd be morphing into Goth mode (not that there's anything wrong with that), but it's a lovely clear purple-pink colour.  One coat on me is more pinkish, two coats is a deeper purply-pink with high shine but no brightness to the pink if that makes sense.  It's not like a purple or pink pop! here's my lips kinda of deal.  It still remains very wearable, and you just look nice. Kir also kicks down to a cool neutral when I combine it with a different brand's peachy colour.  Once I run out of that, I will replace with something from this Buxom line because I assume they blend.  Eventually, I will own all of these.  I haven't touched another lip product (except that one blending mode and Buxom's Dolly) since I started Kir Royal.  When I ran out, I added Cherry Flip and I'm SO glad I did.  I won't wait to run out, though.  I want them all."

For me, I was either always matte lipstick or lip balm, no in between, so glosses weren't always my thing. But for some reason, I decided to pick this up and I am more than glad that I did. It is the absolute perfect everyday shade for me, and I imagine it would be perfect for many other skin tones as well. It's on the thicker side, but isn't uncomfortably gloopy by any means, and it fades gracefully with no white line. It's a gloss, so I wouldn't call it long wearing, but you can feel it on your lips for a couple of hours after application. As for plumping, I didn't notice anything crazy, but that wasn't why I bought it anyway. If your number one priority is a lot of plumping, I don't personally know if this is the best option, but if you're looking for a beautiful shade with maybe a little bit of plumping, definitely check this out. Since purchasing Hot Toddy, I have purchased multiple more shades from this line, but this one is definitely my favorite. If you're looking for a natural, warm pinky brown gloss that won't wash out medium skin tones, I highly recommend trying this one out."

Taste isn’t great if it gets in your mouth but not to bad. White Russian is milky but still gel like enough not to look streaky or gross on the lips. The color is more of a wash and will not look exactly like it does in the bottle on the lips....at least not  for White Russian. decently long lasting for a gloss but will come off with heavy drinking or any eating."

I got these initially for my vacation to Mexico for no makeup days by the pool. They do a great job keeping your lips hydrated. The plumping effect feels cool and minty which was perfect cause it kept your lips cold in the hot weather. Don't think they actually plump but the gloss definitely makes them look juicy and brings attention to your lips making them seem bigger. Really do NOT recommend wearing this in the winter time - I did it once and my lips became so cold and a bit numb from the coldness combined with the mint it was an odd experience."

However, if you put like dots (a bit) of it on the lips, may be a little hard to smooth out (pressing the lips tgt), due to the thickish formula. Has a very subtle vanilla scent. Wish they sold the small size on its own and not in sets exclusively (my first one was from set). And now i purchased the full size <3.  I would say the shade is more of a pinky toasty nude."

They do plump a tad bit but I would not expect anything extreme, I do love the fact that they will fill in lines and make your lips look smoother.

I’ve decided to start using more lipgloss instead of lipsticks because it being easier to apply. This product is moisturizing but also has the most amazing cooling sensation and I cannot get enough of it. I do find it plumps my lips and gives them the most beautiful shine - not a tacky over glossed look.  3. Packaging - pretty packaging. No leaking or issues in my purse. Fits into acrylic holders nicely   Cons: NONE! I want all of these !!"

I have two kids and my 16 month old that has a knack for touching my lips to try to take off my lip color. I will lose the shine eventually, but the color stays for a while longer. I even notice it when I'm taking off my makeup and clean my face with my wipes. I absolutely love the plumping sensation, it's like a minty sensation/flavor.

Cannot say enough good things about this gloss! Love it!"

This formula is nicely pigmented and has decent stay power for a gloss, provides a nice cool tingling sensation and pleasantly subtle vanilla scent. The packaging is also quite sweet, I love the frosted glass. The colour is a delightfully pretty pale pink nude, slightly milky and VERY flattering! I struggle to find nudes in this shade that compliment my light skin with pink undertones without washing me out, which is a total bummer since I love the way they look on anyone else. Needless to say I’m delighted that this one looks so good on me! The only thing negative I have to say about this lip cream is that I see little to no difference in the plumpness of my lips while wearing it, and other lip plumpers work well on me. That said, I’m so in love with everything else about this product that I’m fine with just pairing it with one of my other plumpers if I want a pouty look. This is my first Buxom lip colour, and I’m excited to try more when I get the chance. Would recommend!"

I love all of the Buxom colors I’ve tried, including this one which is the perfect nude/pink for my skin tone.  However, I have sensitive skin/lips and the tingle from the “full-on” line is rather intense.  I recieved this as a sample, and will probably just stick to the regular buxom lip glosses.  I don’t really notice any plumping effect, but I already have rather full lips, so that’s not something I look for anyway."

It looks good but after a bit of use, the gloss will build up around the lid and it keeps coming out when I close the lip gloss. Its a pretty sticky gloss and it gets everywhere. I'm constantly having to wipe it off and its always getting in my purse where I carry it around. I bought one for my mother and she is having the same problem. I love the product just hate the packaging."

I would say there isn't much of a tingle, as it's more of a cool sensation like something minty, it does how ever plump my lips ever so slightly.

The only reason I’m not giving five stars is that it’s a very sticky lip gloss and sometimes accumulated in places on my lips after long wear but I would still definitely recommend this product.

It is SO lightly pigmented, that I dont think anyone should be scared of how purple it looks in the package, because literally all it does is make your lips have a cool tone rather than warm.  I think it would go fantastic over the top of lipstick. I bet I could pair it with any shade. This is going to be a very easy shade to play with for a variety of looks.  By the way, the plumping works! No irritation. Just a bit of a tingle. I was worried it would dry my lips out because it feels like menthol, but it didnt.

It didn't last long either. It just disappeared after 20 minutes. I didn't eat, drink or even speak, it just disappeared.

I love how this looks on your lips and how long lasting it is compared to previous lip glosses I've owned. It hydrates your lips more than I was expecting and keeps my lips from getting chapped in the cold weather. I love it! Will definitely be purchasing again when I run out. If it burns a lot the first time give it another chance, I almost returned it but I'm so so glad I didn't because it turned out to be a lovely product. Only thing is next time I think I'll get a slightly darker color than White Russian because it did make my face look a bit washed out. Also it's great because it doesn't get super sticky!!! Even as it slowly wears down on your lips throughout the day it doesn't get sticky like soo many other lip products I've owned."

I did my make up application roughly 3  hours ago and it is still on my lips. I have kissed my baby (it is transferable but minimal), I have eaten a snack, brushed my teeth and drank water. Still on... not in its original application but pretty darn close. When you apply it, it has a profressional look to it.
