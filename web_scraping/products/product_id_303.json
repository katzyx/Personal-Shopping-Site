	"about": "Fragrance Family: Warm & Spicy..Scent Type: Warm & Sweet Gourmands..Key Notes: Firewood, Mahogany Wood, and Marshmallow..Fragrance Description: Milk’s warm notes of Marshmallow, Tonka Bean and Mahogany Wood emblazoned with the unexpected smoky depth of Firewood and Amber. A smoky, sweet and inviting scent to be worn with confidence...About the Bottle: Black with copper foil, the Bold Collection bottles were designed to stand out just as much as the Bold Scent Space perfumes themselves. The plus sign after the fragrance name, such as Milk+, is used to further demonstrate their amplified projection...About the Fragrance: Through Milk+ Bold, I wanted to capture the nostalgia of a fall family vacation spent making s’mores around the fire. The addition of strong bases renders a bolder persona, elevating the scent and exposing the bolder aspects of my memory. –Christelle Laprade, Maker...",
	"ingredients": "SD-Alcohol 40-B (Alcohol Denat.), Parfum/Fragrance, Aqua/Water/Eau, Coumarin, Eugenol, Benzyl Benzoate, Linalool......The list of ingredients is subject to change, please consult the packaging of the product purchased.",
	"how_to_use": "Suggested Usage:.-Spritz one to two times directly on the pulse points, such as your wrists, inner elbows, or sides of the neck. .-Pulse points are warmer areas of the body that act as natural diffusers when emitting a scent..-After application, allow the scent to air dry. .-Rubbing or dabbing will break down a fragrance and cause it to wear off more quickly..-If you wear fragrance on the wrists, be sure to reapply after frequent handwashing..-Properly store your bottle to extend its shelf life, including recapping after each use and avoiding direct sunlight... Eau de Toilette or Eau de Parfum?: .The difference lies in the volume of perfume oil. While EDT contains five to nine percent, EDP contains more, usually eight to 14 percent. EDPs, therefore, last longer and smell more intense...Recycling Instructions: .-While Commodity works toward fully recyclable packaging, most of your fragrance can currently be recycled. .-Box, paper notecard, and pulp tray should be recycled as paper. .-Glass bottle and metal pump should be recycled as glass. .-Cellophane and bottle cap should be thrown in the trash.",

			"review_text": "So I bought the travel size a few months ago and have been wearing it a few times a week since. The way I can describe this is “home-y”. It’s super comforting and cozy. I purchased the full sized bottle a few weeks ago thinking I was smitten with this fragrance but I have yet to open it because I cannot justify the price for the mediocrity of it. Now don't get me wrong, this does smell great! I have received quite a few compliments in a short span of time. But to me, it smells like something I could create by mixing a few other scents that I already own. It's not unique enough for the price. It smells very similar to this cream you kind find at Marshall's called Au Lait for about $7.99 which is oatmeal scented (granted, the lotion scent won't last as long). I've seen someone describe this as smelling like a warm bowl of oatmeal and that's pretty spot on. This DOES indeed last a long time, despite what others are saying. A friend described me as smelling strong and that's with 2 sprays. I can often smell it on me leaving my 10 hour overnight shift at the hospital, as well as other nurses I let sample my travel size. All in all, I'd say to give this a shot via travel size. But as for me, I simply cannot justify $145 plus tax to smell like a warm breakfast staple."

			"review_buyer_description": "Green eyes, blonde hair, Fair skin tone, Dry skin",
			"review_text": "I have fallen so hard in love with this I feel inclined to make a review. I feel as though I have missed out on this brand and scent for so long due to reviews leading me astray - it just goes to show how subjective scent is - what smells like perfection to someone can be anothers idea of awful and vice versa. So from now on I will read reviews and take them with a grain of salt. But, in my opinion, this is simply beautiful. I get the warm frothy milk vibe in the opening, then it drys down to gorgeous toasty woods with a hint of roasted marshmallow in the background. I am a gourmand lover; I read this perfume is masculine and cologne like so I stayed away from it. As someone who likes scents like Bianco Latte, Escapade gourmand, blanche bete, delizia di marshmallow, italica, akro bake (you get the picture) , I truly love gourmands and I don't like 'masculine' scents. This to me isn't masculine at all. I do think it's unisex (as could be any scent, really), and not a full blown gourmand, but wow it's beautiful. I also was afraid it would be extremely strong. To be honest, I don't think it projects THAT far nor do I think it's a 'strong scent'. It stays fairly close to the skin, but with that being said it lasts alllll day and then some. I can still smell it on my skin after I shower. The fact that it lasts a long time just makes it even better, I struggle with so many perfumes that have no lasting power and this is one that lasts and lasts, it just isn't overpowering. So glad I tried this, I will try the milk expressive next, hopefully they are noticeably different. <3 feels heavy and I can tell its good quality too. love love love."

I do get the smokiness (which I generally love) and a tiny bit of sweetness, but it's mainly a smoky sourish smell, at least on me, and absolutely is not something a woman could wear unless you straight up wanted to smell like a man.  I only wear vanilla, marshmallow, campfire, smoky type scents, but the vanilla/sweet/marshmallow needs to be very detectable as well.  Sadly, this one is going back."

I was inhaling/choking on this smoky odor for atleast 30 minutes before I fell asleep. Woke up about 7 hours later... Still smelled like smoke thought it was a little lighter, no sweetness. I just now put in for a return. Not sure if I'll try any of the other scents in this line..."

Im always nervous to buy sweet fragrances because many are way too potent and nauseating, but this one is the perfect level of softness that I was looking for for the fall season. If you like soft and sweet scents that can carry throughout a room, this is the perfect fragrance. Don't buy this scent expecting a smokey smell similar to Replica's By the Fireplace, this one is much softer and the smokiness is much less obvious. It makes me love it all the more!"

I will say I’ve blind bought a few fragrances, angels share and Killians love don’t be shy… but this… smells like mens cologne. I was intrigued by the comments of how people wanted this to smell like “by the fireplace” more sweeter and marshmallow scent. Um no, I smell zero smoke, nothing GOOD. Save your dollars and smell it in store. I’m exchanging this instore for something else. I treated myself to a birthday gift. Yuckkkk"

I loveeee it and im so excited to use this during the fall and colder months"

If you haven’t tried Commodity, you absolutely should—they have a discover kit that goes through each of the scent space fragrances. I hope this fragrance stays forever!"

Oh well, I can share:) I just hope the perfume quality stays the same now that it’s being more widely produced!"
