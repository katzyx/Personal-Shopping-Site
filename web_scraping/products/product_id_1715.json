	"ingredients": "Alcohol, Parfum/Fragrance, Aqua/Water/Eau, Linalool, Benzyl Salicylate, Benzyl Alcohol, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Hydroxycitronellal, Limonene, Coumarin, Methyl Anthranilate, Isoeugenol, Benzyl Benzoate, Citronellol, Citral, C1 17200/Red 33, Ci 60730/Ext. Violet 2.",
	"how_to_use": "Suggested Usage:.-Fragrance is intensified by the warmth of your own body. Apply in the creases of your knees and elbows for a longer-lasting, stronger scent.&nbsp;.-After applying, avoid rubbing or dabbing skin. This breaks down the fragrance, causing it to wear off more quickly.&nbsp;.-If you prefer placing fragrance on your wrists, be sure to reapply after frequent hand-washing, as this tends to rinse off the scent.&nbsp;.-Replace fragrance after 12 months. Expired perfumes more than a year old lose the integrity of the original scent... Eau de Toilette or Eau de Parfum?: .The difference lies in the volume of perfume oil. While EDT contains five to nine percent, EDP contains more, usually eight to 14 percent. EDPs, therefore, last longer and smell more intense.",

			"review_text": "I bought five 'sample' / travel sizes of Viktor & Rolf perfumes to compare them: Good Fortune, Ruby Orchid (Flowerbomb), Nectar (Flowerbomb) and the Original Flowerbomb. I also bought a sample size of Viktor & Rolf's BonBon Couture perfume.  According to Perfume Descriptions: Ruby Orchid is 'bold,' the original Flowerbomb is an 'explosion of 1000 flowers,' Nectar is a 'potent' perfume, Good Fortune is also described as a 'potent' perfume, and BonBon Couture is described as an 'intensive perfume, stronger than the original BonBon perfume.' Now, I won't get into 'scents' here, but I will say: none of these perfumes were intense, strong, explosive, bold, or potent. In fact, I had to check the packaging to be sure that I hadn't accidentally received the less-potent 'Eau de Toilette' versions of each perfume. I didn't - I received the 'real' / strongest version of all of the perfumes.  Nectar Flowerbomb, Original Flowerbomb, and Ruby Orchid Flowerbomb all smelled nearly identical to me. Out of the 'Flowerbomb' bunch: I'd rate Ruby Orchid first, because it was the strongest-smelling, followed by the Original, because it had some scent to it, followed by Nectar, because it smelled like nothing. But I should note that I had to practically DUMP all three of these Flowerbomb perfumes onto myself to even catch a whiff of scent.  Good Fortune was probably my 'favorite' out of all five - however - if you hate apples and have to take a bite out of five different types of apples to pick the 'least offensive' then I suppose that'd be Good Fortune. It didn't smell 'bad' - it was actually quite pleasant - but when I say it was my 'favorite' it was only because it was just slightly stronger than the Ruby Orchid.  Bonbon Couture was awful - for all of the supposed fragrance notes in it, all I smelled was incense - it was super heavy on the patchouli - yuck. It was definitely the strongest-smelling, but it smelled awful."

The scent is sweet (I love sweet fragrances mostly) & floral. Not as sweet as the Nectar in the flowerbomb series.  Is it distinct to other fragrances in the market? Not really, as it is another vanilla base scent. Do I still recommend it? Absolutely! Because of the orchid & peach notes, it's a little different üçë  Note: The photo attached is for 90ml purchased elsewhere as Sephora only sells 30ml :("

			"review_buyer_description": "Brown eyes, black hair, Light skin tone, Dry skin",
			"review_text": "Bought this with my own money in-store at Sephora, not incentivized. This is a gorgeous rounded, complex, sweet floral  from the first spray with an overt sugar note overlaying the flowers at the beginning, with a lovely drydown that never goes weird or bitter or alcoholic. It reminds me of the OG Flowerbomb, which was my absolute favorite scent before it got reformulated over the years. So for the nostalgic folks who are wistful for the 00s like me, this is the one to get rather than the current iteration of Flowerbomb-- which has just turned into a very tea/vanilla-heavy scent with poor performance, few floral notes, and that smells absolutely nothing like what made it so popular years ago. Throw is surprisingly good for this, it's immediately at arms-length, especially on clothes, and you get the loveliest wafts of candied flowers throughout the day when you think it's faded. Longevity is decent, at a few hours."

			"review_text": "I‚Äôm loving the Flowerbomb Ruby Orchid perfume! the original Flowerbomb is one of my favorite perfumes of all time, so I had to try out Ruby Orchid after looking at the fragrance notes. Plus the packaging is so beautiful too! Ruby Orchid does have some of the same DNA as the OG Flowerbomb, but I think Ruby Orchid is stronger than the original, but not in an offensive way. Ruby Orchid has more of a fruity vanilla and warm floral scent, and it smells sweet without being childish or cloying. It‚Äôs a mature sweet perfume without being elderly. This is perfect for spring & summer, but it can be worn all year round too! I‚Äôm good with 2-3 sprays of this and it lasts all day on me! This perfume would be good for all different age groups!"

However, there were no other sample choices I wanted, so I picked it.  I am so glad I did.  It is nothing like the original flower bomb.  Gone is the powder and introduced is the sweet floral.  I normally don't like scents that are sweet in this way. They seem girlish, but this one tones it down, and the flower takes the strong note.  I've received compliments, and it definitely lingers.  It will attach itself to clothes you wore, coats included.  Wear with care, but if you like a romantic floral with a touch of sweet, you will love this.  I plan to buy it, only it's so expensive, I will likely stick to the travel size."

It‚Äôs such a classic and a definite favorite of mine!"

			"review_text": "I came here to write a review on this fragrance because I did a blind buy based on my experience with Flower Bomb and the reviews that were already written and I felt like I had been lead astray a bit so I wanted to write the review that I wish I had read. A lot of people say that this is a sweet perfume, and if you're somebody who doesn't love sweet perfumes I can see how one might perceive that (and we all know perfumes can smell different on different people) but if you do like sweet perfumes like Pink Sugar or even the original Flower Bomb then you should be warned that this one isn't like those. This is a darker floriental sort of perfume. It reminds me of a more floral Black Opium or a more sophisticated version of Katy Perry's Killer Queen. The peach is not a juicy body spray peach, it's a deep and subtle vine note with the barest sparkle of something fruity. The vanilla, like the perfume description, is a complex bourbon vanilla like something you would smell in an alcohol bottle more than a baked good. There is a definite floral note in the middle that nods to flower bomb while being distinctly something new. Like most good perfumes, this one combines into something unique and reading the notes/accords in the description won't give the actual scent any justice. The perfume has burlesque vibes to it, imagine something heady and sexy like sweeping back a velvet curtain as you slink onto the stage of a smokey cabaret. It has an average lasting power and sillage. I got it for a specific event where I was cosplaying as a conflicted character and I think this helped me get into the headspace for that. I enjoy the scent and will use this bottle, but wouldn't buy it again."

It‚Äôs this perfect balance of a sweet vanilla gourmand and a fruity floral.   It‚Äôs not obnoxious at all nor is it the least bit heavy. The sillage is perfect and lasts several hours on me which is remarkable, as my body just loves to eliminate fragrance. It does resemble Nectar a bit in how it‚Äôs structured but without the patchouli base note, I think I like this even more. It‚Äôs the perfect summer fragrance.

I have already purchased this flowerbomb ‚ÄúRuby orchid‚Äù right when it dropped, then took it back. I wear more ‚Äúniche‚Äù fragrances these days, but I still have my day 1 signature scents AKA Flowerbomb & Black Opium. Well, I‚Äôm not big into designer perfume anymore (I‚Äôm into niche) but the flowerbomb line always has a special place in my heart. I went into Sephora today to get me a new bottle of the original ‚ÄúFlowerbomb‚Äù because it‚Äôs almost empty. I ended up purchasing ‚ÄúRuby orchid‚Äù instead and ALSO for the second time! I compared flowerbomb on one scent tester, then compared Ruby orchid, and honestly, Ruby orchid gives flowerbomb a ‚Äúbite‚Äù if you will. The ruby orchid, red vanilla bean, peach, and bourbon vanilla will rock your socks. The original has patchouli in it (which I adore) and ruby orchid does not. Theirs something about ruby orchid that makes me love it even more than flowerbomb, and I do believe it‚Äôs that bourbon vanilla in it. First spray is Ruby orchid and peach, then once it settles into the skin you have that vanilla bourbon which is off the chain. I don‚Äôt collect designer anymore, but flowerbomb line always has a place on my fragrance tray. Ruby orchid just happened to beat the original today lol. I also bought this once already, and now here I am again buying it again. That must be saying something right? This is beautiful honestly. Same scent profile as the original, but has a kick to it that I love."

It's soft and pretty but also flirty and very intriguing. The peach and vine notes really pair well with the Flowerbomb DNA and makes it more versatile to wear imo. For longevity, I need to test this a bit more but it doesn't seem to last as long as I would like on the skin (3-4 hours). But on clothes, this lasts for a very long time.

This is not nearly as potent but it's still really good smelling however the only reason I'm giving it 4 stars it's because the formula does not last more than maybe 4 hours (but it differs for everyone)  The smell is actually really nice though I don't smell much of the flower bomb In this after maybe 2 minutes of drying it's a completely new different cent (fruity but floral, red floral) and I actually really like it. it doesn't pierce your nose and its especially not overpowering."

I'm kind of known for my many different scents and my girlfriends all asked me what I was wearing when I showed up so that is always the sign I'm looking for to let me know what I'm wearing is a winner/keeper. Obviously as the name states, it's primqraly sweet & floral-y with some undertones of spice, like very light cinnamon possibly, and the sweetness reminds me of vanilla. Definitely winner!"

I read some reviews about this fragrance and read about the notes in it, and when I got to smell it, it smelled just like I imagined. It does smell nice, but this was a little bit too sweet for my liking. I have used it a few times, but it is definitely not a perfume I would buy in a future, since I'm more into fresh, citrus, woody kinda scents. I think the bottle is quite cute too, and I do like the shape of it and the color. I will keep using it during winter time, but I think that's about it."

I actually expected this to be a very sweet fragrance when I had read about it - orchid and vanilla. But boy, was I pleasantly surprised! I found this to be way more fruity than sweet-floral and not at all overwhelming. Once the scent settles down, in an hour or two, you do start to get the top floral notes more pronounced and eventually almost drowning the fruity notes it has. I wish the fruity notes lingered a little longer because I instantly loved the perfume because of that, but not a huge issue. I would summarize the fragrance as a very feminine fruity romantic one. Also just 2 sprays work, but the fragrance disappears in 5 hours or so. Another complaint about this perfume is the price, it is a little pricy when I compare it with some similar, not so long lasting but fab perfumes I own. Overall, I did like the perfume, and it is more of a special occasion perfume for me not an everyday wear. But might actually consider buying it again if the price comes down a bit!   P.S. Would actually pay this much for any perfume that smells like this and stays on for the whole day without a doubt."

I usually don't care for florals but this is different. They combined the notes so perfectly even the most anti floral person would Iike this. I look forward to trying the original one as well! I'm hooked and definitely recommend! The only downer is the price point. But I don't have a limit when it comes to buying beautiful smelling perfumes so when I find a scent as beautiful as this one I will spend the money.

However, it‚Äôs not ‚Äòthat‚Äô long lasting."

Original flowerbomb lasts much longer than this.  Yes I get it, it's two different fragrances but if it's going to smell like the original it should last all the like the original."

			"review_text": "I recieved a complimentary bottle of this amazing perfume for my honest opinion about it. Here it is. This perfume was touted as a Fruity Gourmand perfume. A fruity bent, gourmand level scent. Right on the fruity, double on the gourmand, but that ignores the lovely almost heavenly, and seriously not too cloying flower notes. I was quite terrified when I got this bottle. I was afraid that it would be so flowery (with a name like Flowerbomb, can you blame me?). It is not overpowering floral, or perfumy.   This scent is so sweet and delicate, the lower notes make it sexy and sensual, and the fruity notes maje it light and fun. I can truly say that whether I wear it to a Wedding, Date, Lunch with my Mother or a Funeral, I will be appropriately perfumed. It is the little black dress of petfumes."

Tje perfume smells sweet w hints of floral, it's kinda strong but smells pleasant and I've gotten lots of compliments on it from co workers and etc. I'm more of a fruity citricy scent kinda gal but was pleasanty surprised w this long lasting sweeter scent. Overall I'm very pleased and love it! I can see myself buying a bigger bottle soon."

It is a little sweet but very smooth.  It is elegant and delicious.  Thank you very much influencer and   Victor&Rolf for this beautiful gift that to this day has been my favorite perfume of all time."
