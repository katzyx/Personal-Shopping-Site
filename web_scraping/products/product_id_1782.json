			"review_text": "I really wanted to love this foundation. I adore the stretch concealer especially as a light weight concealor that blended easily no matter what you used to blend. This foundation however did not work for me personally. Maybe I was using the wrong primer type or my skincare was off when I was using it. But it clung to my dry patches on my cheeks  and due to the lightness of the foundation made it very noticeable that it was doing so. Loved the more gel like consistency, and loved I found a foundation shade light enough for me — maybe too light even, but this was not it for me. Again, totally willing to say it was my skin type or my primers but if you struggle with clinging I’d for sure maybe weigh this foundation option against some other good ones that won’t have this affect."

It stays on, the finish is not matte/cakey but also not oily and shiny. it's a perfect combination for oily skin and i love that the coverage is buildable. Only downsides is that it CAN transfer a bit if you dont set it (but who ISN'T setting liquid foundation already?) and that the pump is sort of getting stuck on me now that I'm running low on it. I'm not sure if I damaged it from using it so much, though!"

			"review_text": "I really like this foundation, it’s very lightweight and it’s the only foundation I have found that isn’t really yellow on me which is pretty lucky considering I guessed my shade when I ordered it (I don’t recommend guessing your foundation shade) but there are one thing keeping me from giving this 5 stars.  It’s a bit drying around the mouth and smile lines so it looks a bit crusty in those areas after talking a lot. I wouldn’t doubt that this would settle into forehead creases, but since I have bangs I don’t wear foundation of my forehead so I’m not certain. Also just a tip, it ends up looking  a bit patchy when applying with a brush. The easiest way to wear this foundation is putting 1 pump on the back of your hand and spreading it on your face with one of your fingers, then dabbing out to blend into the skin, when I was using a brush it resulted in some unevenness."

I really like that it makes my skin look even toned (which it is not), hides redness from rosacea and seems to have staying power (lasted through a 10-hour workday). When I went to pick up the actual product, I double-checked with the Sephora representative to make sure that the color I had chosen was the right match. She told me it looked so natural she didn't think I was wearing foundation. So, if a natural (vs. matte or luminous) finish is what you're looking for, I'd give this one a try. For reference, I'm a MAC NC20 and got the 4 Light in this foundation. Also, my skin is combo with drier cheeks and oilier t-zone. I also have rosacea and this conceals it without aggravating it."

This is mainly because I like the “natural” makeup and I thought foundation would make it a bit too much for me. But since I love glossier, and wanted to level up my makeup a bit I bought this. I have very bad sensory issues and bangs so I hate when i feel something gross on my face. This was very very light, it quite literally felt like nothing was on my skin I am not joking to you. The shade match was also beautiful. I am neautral toned but that was way too yellow for me in store so I got the cool toned one. The cool toned is still a tad yellow especially if you are a true cool tone shade. Other than that it’s very lightweight and holds up nice. It’s very pretty with more coverage on the medium side. It’s also not too glow or not too matte, perfect in the middle. It’s not drying or heavy or cakey either. It’s very gorgeous and natural if that is your thing. But i do think that if you are typically a certain undertone then you should go one undertone cooler. Overall this product is amazing for someone like me who prefers the natural makeup that feels very lightweight."

Anyhow, this foundation makes my skin completely flawless, and I mean Flaw.Less. I’m 40, yet it gives me the same skin condition that I had when I was in my 20s. Smooth, line - free, plump, and  poreless skin. The result still looks fantastic even after 12 hours of wear, without any patchiness, cracks, or oiliness that makes one’s pores look like holes, because the foundation moves with my facial movements!  Glossier’s “Stretch Foundation” is amazing; I apply it with my fingertip, pat on the “Stretch Concealer” after, and top of all off with their “Wowder” Finishing Powder.   I’ve noticed, too, that over time, the results became long - term. For example, now even after I’ve washed all of my makeup off, my skin is still plump with minimized lines and pores. It’s also gotten very soft, too!  For reference, my foundation shades are NARS “Santa Fe,” MAC “NC20,” and anything else with the words “Buff” or “Vanilla” in the name, and my Glossier foundation and concealer shades are both “Light 1.”"

It’s perfect for my day to day routine. The shade- light 5- matched my skin tone seamlessly - it is light with yellow undertones and provided a subtle enhancement.

The puff worked slightly better than the others, but it still didn't offer the buildability I was hoping for.  One of my main issues with this foundation was how it accentuated the parts of my skin I wanted to smooth over, like fine lines and acne.

This creamy foundation is buildable (light-med coverage) and blends effortlessly.. it gives a very natural looking finish to the skin. I don’t have many skin imperfections so for me this type of coverage works great! But I have to say, this foundation isn’t super long wearing. With a proper primer + setting the foundation, it lasts about 4-5 hours on my combination skin. I have shade M4"

			"review_text": "I want to start my review by helping with the shade description and comparisons, as I look for these reviews myself when buying complexion products!  First off, I immediately noticed that Glossier goes VERY light, and also that this particular shade (very light 1, described as neutral), is not a yellow-based shade. I am unsure whether it’s a true neutral or simply NOT a warm-leaning neutral (which is often the default for brands!), but I think some of you will be very pleased to discover this. If you know you are a cool or warm undertone, I would recommend opting for the shades described as such. If you are purchasing this for light coverage, note that you will have more flexibility in a less-than-perfect shade match as it can be worn as a tint.  As far as use, first off, don’t make the mistake I did. It’s not a twist lid - simply pull to reveal the pump. If you see a stick, you’re looking at the pump’s mechanism instead (lol). The product spreads very easily regardless of how you apply: brush, fingers, sponge. One pump is enough to get a bit of coverage but still not look like you’re “wearing foundation.” In terms of coverage, this product really does feel in-between a skin tint and a light coverage foundation. I do prefer this for light coverage, but it can indeed be build up. Multiple pumps did start to feel heavy on my skin, personally. I also found that I did prefer to set this with powder as it is not a self-setting skin tint.  When I opt for one pump, this wears nicely on my dry skin without settling into lines or showing texture. I do not have oily skin, but I suspect oily skin types would also prefer setting this with powder as otherwise it is a bit dewy/shiny.  Overall, I would say I am impressed with the shade range and appreciate that the product is as described!"

The color is a great match for medium olive skin. However, due to the gel cream texture, it can get cakey around my chin very fast and can also settle into lines if not set properly. Using a smoothing primer underneath is a must with this. I've used this throughout the winter and it is very comfortable to wear. I would definitely recommend giving this a shot if you can find your shade, especially if you have dry skin. Just make sure to prep well beforehand."

I asked a beauty advisor what she would recommend and she said Glossier.  I was skeptical, but I took it home and tried it.  The color match was spot on and it blended so nice with a foundation brush.  I used one small pump for my whole face and it even covers my redness. The finish is dewy and natural, and I can use it close to my eyes so I use less concealer. It's not as transfer proof as Estee Double Wear, but it does seem to stay on all day without touchups and the finish is just better for mature skin.  I might use an oil blotting sheet once a day on my t-zone. Two bonuses: price point is way better and Glossier is cruelty free, yay!"
