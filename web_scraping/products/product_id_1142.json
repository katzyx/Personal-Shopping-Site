			"review_text": "I bought this in April 2022 despite the mixed reviews. I want to sculpt the lower half of my face and have tension in my jaw, so I decided to try this tool for both purposes. Regarding the delicacy - mine came intact and working, with both balls rolling, but it does feel fragile in two ways: the natural stone and the construction. This is designed differently than other massage rollers I've seen out there... the jade balls have a slightly oblong hexagonal surface, as opposed to smooth jade balls. The result is that as these roll across any area of my skin that has fat (such as my cheeks), it gently grips the flesh between the texture of the balls and tugs it in that direction, instead of just gliding across the skin. In my experience so far, that is the feature of this design that actually makes it worth it. The blood flow in my face feels more stimulated from this gentle pinching motion than it ever has from a smooth roller, and I have my own way that I like to roll my face that always pulls upward. So this roller is always massaging/tugging the plumper areas of my face up. I'm extremely happy with that - but careful not to tug on delicate areas. The construction of this is excellent for facial sculpting, but perhaps more fragile, so definitely register it with Mount Lai and try not to drop it. And this natural jade feels a lot more delicate than what I'm used to handling in terms of beauty tools (plastic, metal, or even thick glass)... I'm sure this would break if dropped. If you're worried about the breakage issues, they do make this same design in rose quartz. I haven't gotten that version but in my experience, rose quartz feels a bit heavier and more shatter-resistant than jade. Personally, this roller is an A+ for me as long as I use it right for my face and don't break it. Hope this helps."

			"review_text": "I ordered this tool in April 2021 and used it on average about once a week. I grind my teeth and have bad tension in my jaw and found this did soothe it a bit temporarily, and was a cute step in my routine (when I remembered to use it!). However in September 2021 the handle snapped off completely from the metal connecter and when I called Sephora they said they had no warranty on the item. I'm waiting to hear back from the manufacturer to see if i can get a replacement. I have a feeling there are other stone massagers that would do the trick, and at a lower price point. I'm disappointed with Sephoras response to the broken item, and I can see others have had the same issue. I gave it a star for the aesthetic/packaging which is nice, but I would not recommend this product. If Mount Lai doesn't replace it, I'll be looking for a less expensive option elsewhere."

I keep so much tension in my jaw, neck, and upper back, and this is the perfect shape for massaging those muscles. It especially helps with the sides of my neck. Figuring out the proper way to use this took some experimenting, but now I use it all the time. The jade feels especially good on sore muscles when it's cool."

I have owned and used a number of facial tools, rollers, and stones, so this is not my first rodeo and not user error on my part. I have tried it so many different ways and cannot, for the life of me, get these to roll in any way. You may as well drag a rock across your face because it’s basically the same effect. It simply does not work. There is no way I would recommend this product to anyone. If you got this roller to work, please tell me how!"

			"review_text": "Okay so like this is really expensive let’s be honest. But if you are using one of those that are just scraping your face you have no idea what you are missing out on. 1. It makes your face look like you just dropped 20 pounds and your cheekbones and jawline are everything. Like I don’t even want to use bronzer because my cheekbones are already THAT prominent after using this. And I typically have a pretty poofy face. 2. This feels so nice especially if you’ve stuck it in the fridge for an hour. While yes, it can snag your hair just simply... idk... pull your hair back? 3. Such a great Mother’s Day gift. My mom wanted to try it and instantly fell in love that I bought ANOTHER one. I know. I even surprised myself. 3. This thing is sturdy. I had bought a regular roller with just one piece and it snapped in half before I even had a chance to use it. It’s expensive but you truly get what you pay for. 4. Because this is not just one large piece of Jade but rather two roller balls, it fits perfectly in between your under eye and under your cheekbone, your jaw line, and that little part right under your brow bone between your eyes where you didn’t even realize you had tension. Sorry this was long but I felt so passionately about this product I felt like I needed to convince others to see what they are missing. Do not hesitate. You’ll wonder why you’re missing $72 and then cringe when you remember you bought a piece of rolling crystal that only wealthy soccer moms use because they saw an influencer on Instagram recommend it, but then you’ll try it and think. Hey. These soccer moms have the right idea of luxury."

			"review_text": "I bought this based off the 7 positive reviews that are posted here and because it looks so luxurious, but I was wrong. Mine came and looked like it had been used, there were very clear finger prints all over the shiny metal parts and the box had very obviously been opened. I got past that part and just sanitized and washed it. Trying to use this isn’t fun or relaxing unless you use a load of oil on your face and neck and even then, it snags hairs easily and hurts! It pulls and tugs hard at the skin and doesn’t feel as luxurious as a roller of this price should. It also squeaks loudly and the metal joints are loose and move around a lot. After 3 weeks of trying this every single night and trying to find a way to enjoy this, I’m returning it. For $95 you expect a higher quality roller. This is not it."

I thought I would try this out (even though it’s expensive) and it exceeded my expectations. Since I started using this at the end of January, my headaches are down and even though I still clench my jaw, the pain is nowhere near what it used to be.  The product itself is sturdy. I’ve applied different amounts of pressure with no issues at all. You can also register the product on the Mount Lai website."
