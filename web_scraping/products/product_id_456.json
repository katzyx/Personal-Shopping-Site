The formula is lightweight, silky, and absorbs beautifully into the skin without leaving a sticky residue. As someone with combination to oily skin, I was initially concerned about whether it might feel too heavy, but it strikes the perfect balance hydrating without clogging pores. Hyaluronic acid boosted hydration and improved the skin’s elasticity and texture. After a few days of nightly use, I noticed a significant reduction in dullness and fine lines, with my skin looking plumper and more radiant by morning."

My pores look refined and smooth, I have little to no texture on my skin and my fine lines are significantly softened.  I don't love the price, so I'll be honest and say that I go to beauty counters and kindly ask for samples of it after making a purchase, and purchase the full size during sales only, or at discount stores like T***xx."

This is why I decided to start reviewing all the products I have spent an insane amount of money on, especially this HUNDRED dollar serum]  This is a good serum. It hydrates, plumps, feels luscious, and even looks good under makeup.  I have seen no long term reduction in fine lines. It has pore-clogging ingredients and I do notice that my skin gets closed comedones from this when paired with pretty much any primer. It is quite heavy and made of a nice glass. It looks good on the counter.  It is fragranced, by natural things I suppose. It has a similar smell to drugstore olay products. I’m not sensitive to fragrance so I don’t mind, but the fragrance itself isn’t all that nice.  The dropper SUCKS. It barely picks up product. I have to scrape the edges of it to get enough for face and neck. Overall I really like it but it not good enough for the price point and I haven’t noticed any effects besides hydrating. There are much better anti aging products. Anyhow, you can spend all the money on skincare you want but manage your expectations. Nothing with get you results like procedures done in a medspa so save for that instead of getting this serum"

It also helps with the dryness as long as a pair it with a very moisturizing cream (usually the cream by itself is not enough). I apply it in the morning after washing and at night right before applying the Retin-a. On days that my skin is less dry, this is moisturizing enough by itself. I imagine this plus sunscreen would be enough during the summer for my oily skin.

It possibly has antioxidant and barrier repair properties but I like to think of this as a probiotic soothing skin supplement.  It also has other soothing ingredients like chamomile and bisabolol.  Hydrating ingredients like squalane, glycerin, hyaluronic acid, and B5.  I am glad this high end brand has dropped the fragrance from this serum.  I do wish they'd also drop the dyes since they don't serve a real purpose.  I like the natural scent this product has- it's almost like a gingery Cola smell.  I love pairing this serum with other pre and probiotic ingredients like oats, thermal spring water, snail mucin, etc. for soothing the skin.  I took one star off for the insane price point.  It's a good serum but extreme price tags are rarely justified.  There are many other more affordable bifida products on the market that would provide similar results"

			"review_text": "I first used this during my mid twenties when ANR was still the original formula - before it underwent god knows how many reincarnations. Back then I used to find it would help a little with the odd acne mark that would appear every few weeks but did little else for my skin concerns. I was primarily using it in the hopes of some sort of defense against future ageing, but I can't say whether or not it achieved anything, as once the bottle ran out I started using other products and then recently thought why not give it another go?   So onto the latest version 'Synchronized Recovery Complex' which I tried earlier this year. I don't know if it's the fact that 'Tocopherol Acetate' (Vitamin E) has been pushed down to 30th place on ingredients list (used to be 13th), or whether it's because 'Retinyl Palmitate (an ester of Vitamin A) has been completely removed from the new version, but this one didn't do anything for acne marks whatsoever and I used it for over a month. It makes sense as both of those ingredients, especially Vitamin A in any form, are known to help fade marks. Add to that a whole host of new and unpronounceable ingredients and that probably explains why if anything I'd experienced even more breakouts when using this...although which one (or more) of the many new ingredients is the culprit I couldn't say! Not sure why they just couldn't let a good thing be and have to change/ruin it?   ~ My Sephora Top 7 must-have list ~  (My top 7 must-have beauty products of all time, focusing mainly on my purchases at Sephora)  1.

I wake up feeling soft, smooth, and dewy but not oily. My only gripe is this stinks! The smell is chemically and overall gross. I am guessing it has to do with the ferment ingredients. Two, if you are not careful and get this too close to eyes, it will burn. Three, it’s pricey. I can get past the smell and the eye issue, but daily use with this will definitely add up price wise."

The serum is not strong scented and absorbs into the skin immediately. I like to do half a long drop onto the skin directly instead of dropping it in my palms and then applying it to my skin (by the time I do this the serum has already absorbed into my palms!). I like to gently glide the serum all around my face. If you add too much serum it will be harder to apply other products on top and will start to flake off. This is a buildable serum, so you can apply a thin layer of this and then add your sunscreen/ moisturizer (morning or night routine). It works well and I’ve been using the product both in the am and pm before my sunscreen and moisturizer.   I’ve noticed the following:  Within 7-10 days of use (am and pm): most noticeable change is the wrinkle and smoothness under/ around my eye area. It improved dramatically. Overall, skin texture more even, plump and healthy. Skin tone and elasticity of my skin also improved.  Overall, very good and strong product. I enjoyed the old formula (right hand side of the photo) but I like the new formula much better (left side). This is worth every penny and I strongly urge women to be kind to themselves and invest in a good serum for their daily routine.   Both the serums look the same and smells the same. The packaging is different as you can tell. I will be repurchasing and highly recommend this product!"

My pores look the same, my skin tone never evened out, and I don't think I have any fine lines for this to diminish. My skin IS soft but I don't think it was this product (I've been using Snail Mucin).

The box itself is pretty with the blue colour, the bottle reminds me of something my fancy grandma would have the brown being a little mature and the gold being luxe. I think the bottle would be good to reuse as well for a weekend away holding just enough (when we can travel again) Now the best part - I actually felt/saw a difference with this serum!! My skin feels smoother, more even and replenished! I would highly recommend this product and is something I would invest in and add to my skincare routine! I have also just tried the NeoStrata brightening serum and would add that in in the mornings from no serums to two I really like :) I know lots of people love and use this Estée Lauder product and can second all the rave reviews #Skincare #Beauty"

Well, I have to say that as soon as my sample was over I immediately bought a couple of full-sized bottles when they went on sale. The product is just great in every way. It's well-absorbed and lightweight, doesn't leave any sticky residue, which makes it perfect for layering. I can use it both AM and PM and my skin doesn't feel overloaded with skincare. My skin is combination-oily, with rather visible pores, but only after 3 days of PM usage I noticed that my skin texture improved. I don't wake up oily or textured, but rather plumped and moisturized (even when I was using the serum alone with no moisturizer on top to test it's true abilities). It's hard for me to tell if it does anything for wrinkles because I hardly have any. But even my husband admitted that my skin is looking more peachy and healthy now. The price tag is not low, for sure, but the peachy freshness the serum gives is rather worth the money."

It does have a strong scent (not a chemical scent...just a noticeable aroma), which fades very quickly after application - I know this is an issue for some but it is gone the second it absorbs, which is fast. While I didn't notice all the changes the product claimed in 7 days I did wake each morning with noticeably softer skin. It also appeared smoother and more refined by the end of the week. With the results I experienced in 7 days, minimal though they may be, it was enough to make me believe that had I used it for a full 3-4 weeks I would have observed a noticeable difference. I would definitely consider adding it to my skincare regimen. (Sidenote: I read an interview with actress Gillian Anderson, Scully from The X-Files, and she swears by this...and if her skin is any indication of what long-term results are then sign me up because she looks AMAZING.)"

			"review_text": "This product is very hydrating, and I like that it’s a gentle nighttime serum. It also helped calm my skin during what was probably the WORST breakout of my life, like bordering on cystic acne level and I haven’t had a problem with acne (other than a few zits here and there over the years) in like 15+ years. That was definitely a relief. Personally, I really liked it and I thought the little sample bottle I got free from Influenster lasted a long time (10ml, no dropper to measure, used almost every night starting late August with very little left now, 10/26 so with that in mind a 1oz bottle very well could last 6+ months for me) I’m not sure I’d be willing to pay $75+ for just the hydrating properties and small boost in radiance. When I’m seeking an anti-aging product like this, I generally reach for retinol serums - though they are a little harsher on your skin they compared to this, a very gentle serum, I see more anti-aging results with the retinol serum I currently have. That visibly reduced the “frown line” between my brows, and all but got rid of my smile lines. Advanced Night Repair did not help with those things. So I suppose whether you like it or not, really depends on what you’re looking for. If you want smoother skin, hydrated skin, more radiance, this serum is for you and you are really going to love it & start to see results after a week or so. But if you’re in your early 30’s, looking for help with fine lines and early wrinkles, loss of plumpness in your face, I’d recommend Sunday Riley A+ Retinoid serum, and start to see results from that after induction + a month or so of continued use. Despite not having retinol, I’d still recommend it as a good product for certain skin issues like dryness & dullness."

Advanced night repair! She was this serum’s it’s #1 fan.  Believe it or not, this new formula made the original even better! It feels nice on my skin and absorbs quickly. Within just a few days I noticed the benefits of this serum. My skin was more hydrated, plump, and glowing. I have combo oily skin and my cheeks can get very dry. This serum soothed the redness caused by dryness and hydrated my skin immediately. It also smoothed and evened my complexion and I found myself needing less concealer/foundation during the day. Apply this serum before bed and let it work it’s magic! Highly recommended product!  I received this product free from Influenster for testing purposes. My review is my own."

I have used other products that dramatically change skin after 1 use and this is not it. I do not have wrinkles but I do have some fine laugh lines. This product did nothing for that within 1 week. I do not believe it is worth the price tag. Also, a bit of advice: if you can, make an appointment with a dermatologist to find out what active ingredients work best with your skin."

Sometimes my double-wear foundation is a little too drying (during the winter in particular) so I add a drop of ANR and it’s perfect. I know that this is a new formula, but I was thrilled that it didn’t change the results. I am just as happy as the old formula, and after longer use (I only had a week’s sample) I’m sure I will notice a more visible change. I recommend it for all skin types."

But as I am about to turn 30 soon and have been noticing wrinkles and lines around lip and eye areas and less firm skin, this updated version of Advanced Night repair came on time.  Because of my hormonal breakouts, I often use tons of strong acne products on my skin, so this was quite effective for smoothing and hydrating my skin, without making it oilier, which is very important for me. In the morning after applying this, my skin looked cleaner, brighter and felt softer that I don’t even want to wash its residue or film it leaves to keep the result all day lol.  I noticed that since I included this serum in my nighttime skincare routine, my BB cream sat on my skin more evenly, with no flaky patches throughout the day.  I liked its silky, non-greasy and quick-absorbing texture. The smell is weird like a plastic material, but tolerable.  To really see its wrinkle reduction effect, I need to use it for a longer time. Although this tiny 7 ml bottle was enough to use every night for two whole weeks, the full size is too overpriced for me. But I would recommend if you can afford it and it is definitely a must—try.

			"review_text": "I received a sample of the Advanced Night Repair Synchronized Multi-Recovery Complex compliments of influenster and Estée Lauder to use for one week and I liked it. While it is fragrance-free, there’s a fermented scent some might not love though it fades quickly and didn’t bother me. My skin quickly soaked it up and I was blown away by how deeply moisturized it left my skin, especially when paired with the Intense Reset Concentrate!   My skin felt soft, smooth and incredibly hydrated — it even looked more plump and radiant when I woke up. I was also impressed with the skin barrier repair function and how quickly it relieved my sensitive skin’s retinoid-induced irritation. I was, however, disappointed in the inclusion of sodium hyaluronate over a direct form of hyaluronic acid, which offers pro-repair support far beyond basic water hydration that sodium hyaluronate offers. That would be my expectation of a hyaluronic acid serum at this price point.  This ANR serum seems promising, but one week simply isn’t enough time to see noticeable results that justify the $75/oz price. As such, I cannot speculate whether it delivers promised results with consistent use of at least 2 months (I’m skeptical of the 72 hour hydration claims). I gave it 3 stars because of the price and the cheaper form of hyaluronic acid. If you aren’t price sensitive and/or are looking for a hydrating peptide serum, I did enjoyed and recommend trying the new ANR Synchronized Multi-Recovery Complex."

The serum absorbed quickly, but day after day, I saw no improvement to my skin. It was somewhat hydrating but couldn’t even compare to my $15 serum on that front. I noticed my fine lines popping up from not receiving their usual intense hydration.

I’ve been using this serum every night for a couple of weeks (this bottle has lasted me a while!) and I can say that I love what it has done to my skin. . The serum itself is kind of a runny gel like consistency that initially feels a bit sticky when applying, but it completely dissipates when it soaks into your skin. I’ve also noticed that a little goes a long way! . Once I apply it, I notice that my skin has a bit of a glow to it, and it feels instantly plumped and hydrated. I also wake up to a very hydrated, radiant looking complexion. . . PR/Gifted, but reviews are my own. ."

The product then dried into a shellacked layer on my face, making every wrinkle, discoloration, and fine line very apparent. It almost looks like an egg white mask. I didn’t see any improvement with my skin, and it actually seemed to dry out my skin, which already had problems with flakiness. Would not recommend for skin types like like. Product doesn’t deliver promised results, and honestly my moisturizer is better at plumping my skin."

With this product I was excited to try it because a lot of my older clients usually buy from department store counters before visiting me. The active ingredients are listed a lot further down, making them not be as active as they should be therefore not giving you the results that you should be getting. It also has added fragrance, and colors. I'm not a fan of that and I felt like I was putting a mixed alcoholic drink on my face. It also made me break out from the oil in it.  I think it's really overpriced for what you're getting I would highly suggest getting a serum from a medical grade skin care line that has proven results.

Doesn’t leave stickiness behind which is a added bonus. After the first night I woke up to my skin feeling soft and hydrated. Through out the week I noticed my skin becoming less dull and much more radiant. I can’t speak to continued use but I can say for the six days that I used it. It made my skin soft, hydrated, plump and radiant. I really enjoyed this product. This is the first product I’ve tried from Estée Lauder and look forward to trying more from this brand."

It's a great product, but didn't make enough of a difference for me to justify the price point. Especially during this time. Maybe in the future when I can afford it, I'll give it a try again. I did like that I saw a bit of a difference in my skin when it comes to texture and softness. However, I don't think I used enough of it to make a big difference. I would recommend it to someone who could afford it.  I like that it has hyaluronic acid which is great for us with dry skin."

Also, oddly noticed that my under-eyes look more delicate and purple than usual after a week of using this serum. I received a week's worth sample, which I believe will last me about 2 weeks since you don't need much product to cover your whole face.

Skin cell turnover is roughly a month. 5) Pro: Formulation seems promising. 6) Con: Price. There are other competing fermented ingredient products out there for way less money that have a cult-following for a reason. For this formulation as is, either cut the price to a bit higher than said competitors, or reformulate to make it more beneficial to be a standalone product to quantify the price."

It’s a great lightweight serum, it’s measured out for you so there’s no guessing, and it soaks into the skin really well. This is one of the few products I’d suggest taking before and after photos when using. You’ll see a difference.  I had a friend who worked in a department store who sold Estée Lauder and was in her 50s. She used the demo for this product on her hand every day, and left her other hand without any treatment. In a month there was a visible difference! Ever since then, I’ve kept this little gem in my skincare bag."

I feel like for the first time trying something like this, I could actually visibly see a difference!! It made my skin look healthier, and just better! I especially noticed my smile lines are so much less visible now. This product doesn’t have any added fragrance which is great. At first it has a slight smell from whatever is in it, but it quickly dissipated. It’s super lightweight you can’t feel it on your skin at all once you rub it in. I put my moisturizer right over it with no problems at all! It soaks into the skin so so well. I saw results within a week of using it! My skin definitely looks more supple and radiant since incorporating this into my daily routine.

Afterwards, my skin felt supple and moisturized. Usually I need to apply a thick night cream before bed but this surprisingly provided more than enough moisture for me.

It is the Estee Lauder Advanced Night Repair Serum • I used this everyday in the morning. It sat well under makeup and it’s packed with hyaluronic acid so if you live an a humid environment and you have dehydrated and dry skin this will be so special for you. It was almost too hydrating for me at times but if you’re really dry and dehydrated this is ideal. If you don’t live in an environment with moisture in the air the hyaluronic acid in this product can actually do more bad than good and dehydrate your skin even more. • I see no anti-aging affects but I do think you will notice a more youthful look to your skin when using this because it’s meant to add hydration to your skin that you may be missing which “plumps” your skin. • I do think as I get older this is a product I’ll have to keep in mind as my skin changes and doesn’t hold as much water and hydration in the skin as easy. It is expensive but it think the results can be worth it for your skincare routine"

I can’t talk about long term because I used the sample for about 2 weeks, it lasted a little longer than the 1 week sample. It did add a glow to my skin as well. I hated the scent, it smells like pain thinner but the scent isn’t too much, I’m sensitive to scent and it automatically went away once rubbed in. I don’t think I’d purchase the actual product because the price is a little high and I didn’t see much to justify it. I’d say if you don’t already have a hyaluronic acid and an anti aging serum I think this would work great. Good product overall."

I uses the previous edition for more than a year. I had glowing, healthy, hydrated skin every morning. It used to be my fav!! But this one....ugh with overhyped  hyaluronic acid formula. it has been a month that i tried this one and it breaks my skin. Not a fan and not wasting my money on this."

It has incredibly helped with the puffiness under my eyes and it has tamed down my forhead wrinkles"

Other hyaluronic acid serums I’ve used have left my face tacky. This serum has a smooth texture that soaks in nicely, and leaves my face feeling plump. My only complaint is that using this serum in my nighttime routine during the hotter months, leaves my combination skin oilier in the morning then I prefer. My skin gets very easily shinny during the summer, so for someone with my skin type, I suggest using this serum in the drier months when the extra hydration is necessary.   I cannot speak of the anti-aging benefits for this serum. Aging is not one of my skin concerns, yet. However, I can see how it would do a nice job of plumping fine lines, thanks to the hyaluronic acid. After using this serum for two weeks, the only real lasting result I saw was hydration. My skin is always glowy and healthy looking in the morning after using this in my nighttime routine. If you do want to use this product for the anti-aging benefits, I suggest purchasing the full size. The smaller option lasted me two weeks, since I am petite and have a smaller face. For most people, it only lasted them one week. Which, of course, wouldn’t give you the full results from a skincare product."

It has a very light fragrance that is barely noticeable but it is not clinical or medicinal so I really like that, it’s still indicative of a skin product. The color is clear and the texture is smooth, silky, not sticky and very watery that you definitely need a dropper for it to be the most effective. I tried the product for a week and I did not have the dropper so I used my finger and it was hard to gauge how much product to use plus due to its consistency it was hard to keep it on my finger without it spilling or rolling off of it. So I ended up using about 5 drops per side of my face concentrating on the under eye area. I have to say the initial feeling is not impressive but the results speak for themselves. It dries and absorbs very quickly and does not make your skin feel greasy or sticky or as if you have a mask on but you can still feel the moisture that hydrates the whole day it seems and you skin becomes smooth and soft and even more plump to the touch and stays like that for hours and that is only on the initial. When using consistently your skin changes the texture of how it should be in the first place, smooth, hydrated and plump. My only dislike was the lack of the dropper and the consistency to too watery for my liking and I was not used to the product being absorbed so quickly into my skin. I usually prefer to see and feel the product for a while, however I can’t argue with the visible results. Thank you. Will continue using this product."

The product did not have a strong odor that I could tell which was a positive for me as well. So the downside, I had a bit of acne flare up while using, I am wondering if this would have calmed down with long term use. I do think that others will see very positive results as I do feel that it is a quality product. I also would consider myself using this again for a longer period to see if my acne would calm down and if it was just because it was a new addition to my skin care routine."

I can’t seem to pinpoint what it is in there that does it but right about at the 1 week mark of use I start to notice breakouts. If I continue to use it the breakouts get worse and they are the deeper ones that Seem to want to stick around for a long time. Since I knew that is how my skin reacted before I decided to stop using this as soon as the breakouts started. Luckily they have mostly cleared up now but I’ve got a couple on my cheek that are stubborn. Since I’ve never been able to use it for very long I can’t really speak to the anti aging benefits. I did receive this product complimentary for testing purposes"

I have combination skin and fine lines and this was an amazing addition to my skincare regimen! I saw significant improvement in viscosity, look, and overall tone! Would recommend and WILL purchase."

So I thought eh it's ok. Then my husband came home from work. He kissed me hello as always and was setting his stuff down as we were chatting. He stopped and was like wow your...then he stopped. I was like what??? He said we'll i was going to say your makeup looks really nice, but then I looked closer and saw your not wearing make-up. Your skin looks beautiful, almost glowy. I said SHUT-UP!! Are you kidding me? He said no why? I then told him I started using a new serum tonight and it was literally the only thing on my face. So I am a believer!!! I would buy a vat of this stuff if I could afford it!! Absolutely love the results it gave. Whatever they did to reformulate this serum it worked. They created an incredible product. I would definitely recommend trying it if you get the chance. I will only be repurchasing if they have a big sale going on. Girls on a budget ya know....lol"

Aside from that the product absorbes really quick, its easy to apply and leaves the skin feeling plump and nice. It has a little bit of a smell but nothing overpowering and goes away quickly. After realizing the allergic reaction (not the first time this has happened. My skin is very picky lol) I decided to give the product to my mom. Her skin is more on the normal to oily side and is not as sensitive as mine. A lot of products that don't work for me do for her. She didn't have a reaction and so far likes it a lot.

I haven’t been using this product long enough to see any long term results, but so far what I have seen I love! It’s super easy to use. I just put it on at night after washing my face and before moisturizer, so it’s been super easy to incorporate into my routine. My skin feels so soft and smooth in the morning and I love it! I was only given a weeks worth of a sample to try, but I heard that if you use in the morning as well it gives you a little extra boost. I received this product for free to test and review, but I would consider buying the full size option to use!"

The process of cell renewal occurs when we sleep; our skin goes into recovery mode.  As we get older, this recovery mode no longer works the same way on its own and so this product helps to facilitate it.  When I was younger, this serum made no difference.  I think it’s because I was renewing my cells naturally on my own back then so I couldn’t see a difference.  So I stopped using it.  BUT, now that I’m older, I can’t live without this serum.  If I travel without it, my skin gets mad at me.  I now need this in my life every single night.  I do not recommend this serum to anyone under the age of 30.  I would highly highly highly recommend this as a holy grail to anyone aged 30+.  It’s a must-have for me."

I am an Asian woman in my mid 20s suffering from overactive skin texture and occasional breakouts. Mt current skin regime does include a serum that i paused using while i used this product.   The first thing one notices about this product is it's scent. There is a citrusy scent that reminds me of citrus flavored cough medicine. Although this was not a big turnoff for me, I know there are others who dislike fragrance in skincare, even more so if it smells like what sick tastes like.   I used this product daily every night for a week, although the instructions says you can use it in the morning as well. The biggest take away i got from using this product was my skin didn't feel as greasy when I woke up the next morning. My skin felt moisturized without having to use my facial oil overnight. Another thing was that aside from stress pimples and mascne here and there, I did notice my skin texture have calmed down a bit.  If this product wasn't so spendy on a struggling career woman's wallet, it would definitely be a part of my nightly routine. Alas, unfortunately a bottle of this product costs more than two weeks worth of groceries so I shall pass. I will consider it for the right price (maybe black Friday price?) Though."

I'm a huge fan of serums, and this one is no joke. I have insanely dry, irritated skin that's prone to redness, fine lines and hormonal acne. Just a few drops of this product nightly has made a huge difference in the appearance of my skin! I wake up and theres actual moisture on my face where flakes used to be. My skin look brighter, more evened out, hydrated and youthful! It does have a strange scent but not perfume like, which I prefer since I'm sensitive to fragrance in skincare. The scent doesnt ladt once applied, so that's also a plus. I can honestly say in the month I've been using this my face has seen an overall improvement. Can you find something to do the same thing in a lower price range? Probably. But if you have it and are willing to splurge....I think it's worth it."

However, I only used at night after my face was washed. I will say though that I found it to be a bit tacky for the first several minutes. It did have a slight smell to it that I was not fond of as well.  Overall, I would recommend to friends."

It goes on nicely on the skin and I feel it being absorbed into it as opposed to just sitting on top of my skin like some other serums do. There’s no scent and no stickiness/pilling, which are added pros. However, for a $105 serum, I’d want more moisturizing - I do wake up with brighter skin, but I notice my skin is a bit dry even though my skincare routine involves several steps of moisturizing and sans this serum, I’ve had no issues with dry skin in the morning before."

I don’t think it has a funny smell and the texture is like a watered down gel. It doesn’t feel heavy on my face which I appreciate but I will say I can actually feel some tightening, idk if it’s just me or that’s what you should feel. I had spots on my face and my spots started fading with it. It also gave me a glow, which I’m surprised at how much skin can change in one week. I feel like I look younger and less tired despite the fact my sleep keeps getting progressively worse. I put it on around the same time every day (along with my usual facial routine) and clean my face off with just toner in the AM so nothing special being done. I’m super excited to have gotten sent this to try for free but I will say I’m low key sad I probably won’t be getting it again because it’s pricey.

I used the ANR serum for the first time a couple of years ago and loved the luxurious feel, it's unlike anything I have ever used. It's even better now, with the Chronolux™ Power Signal Technology, which helps increase the skin’s natural ability for visible self-repair, with in vitro testing showing it promotes skin’s natural renewal of vital new cells and boosts its natural production of collagen.  I definitely noticed an improvement in my skin after three weeks of use. I have been battling with uneven skin tone around my upper cheekbones area and it is finally evening out:) I also noticed my skin looks more radiant, like a nice glow from within look. I will definitely love to purchase the serum but it's too expensive so I will have to save up before I make a purchase (Ladies, we’ve to glow up responsibly). Overall, it does what it claims so I give it a strong 4 (it would be a 5 if the bottle was bigger and affordably priced)."

It does not leave an oily or sticky residue and it really does makes my skin smoother from when you put it on, to the next morning. The biggest downfall for me is the smell. It has an earthy, dirt/herbal medicine smell that I do not like.  The smell doesn't linger but I'm just not a fan of the smell. Also, looking at the price, I personally would try to find something else because I don't know if I can justify the price for this product"

Since this is a peptide heavy serum, I knew that results would take longer than a week to show as you need to use peptides for long term to see any actual results. Besides that, my first impression of the serum was that it was pretty hydrating (I'm assuming this is from the Hyaluronic Acid) and that there was a weird no fragrance smell. Even though this serum also includes ferments, I did not notice any brightening effects. The instructions also mentioned that you only need a few drops but since my sample did not come with a dropper, it was a bit hard to see exactly how much I need. A dime amount did cover my face and neck sufficiently but I do have a smaller face. For the price of this serum, I cannot recommend this as I did not see any noticeable difference in my face except for hydration but I have much cheaper and more effective serums in my skincare routine for just that. I am also not convinced that the peptides in this serum are effective enough to show any long term difference."

So glad I received this complimentary sample from Influenster to remind me how much Estee Lauder products agree with my skin. I have extremely sensitive, dry skin and I make the mistake of going to the tanning bed A LOT for a minute. Using the EL Advanced Night Repair and EL Perfectionist together really helps my skin!

The scent is a little odd, I think I would prefer no scent compared to the scent this serum has. I do like the texture and how well my skin soaks it up.

I’ve never used the original formula so I was excited to give this a go! I tried to research what changed from this to the old one but simply found that it’s meant to be more firming than the previous version. And they added a new blend called Chronulux and Hyaluronic Acid is now present in the formulation.  I’m trying hard to get this to work, but it just isn’t doing it for me. I’m not really noticing much of a difference in my skin - how it looks (they said to watch lines/pores) or how it feels (it’s supposed to be forming but I’m not noticing that). I’m having a hard time using this as part of my routine too. It’s causing my other products to pill up. I quickly learned it’s really something that needs to be used all on its own.  The texture is very gel like and silky; no scent to my nose. It would be good for you if your routine is simple and you want to use only one step. This worked best for me when I used just this."

The serum is relatively thick but slippery and soaked into the skin well. It leaves the slightest tackiness. The scent is...interesting. I don’t think I like it very much but it’s not overpowering and goes away quickly. It’s kind of earthy/herbal? The price tag is hefty but you can get away with using less product than usual. That being said, I personally can’t justify spending $100+ on a serum. I would probably buy the mini size again if I have an important event coming up and I wanted my skin to look good."

			"review_text": "I got a sample size of this to review, which I was super excited about.  The downside to that is it’s tough to get a true judge on how well skincare works without using it for at least a month, and the sample lasted about a week.  The texture of this is nice, it sinks into the skin quickly.  It isn’t overly scented so it just smells nice and light.  It hasn’t made me break out, but other than that it’s tough to say how much it has impacted my skin without trying it for longer."

Now that I have been perfecting my own skincare routine, I wanted to give this a fair shot and used consistently for a few weeks. I realized that I did not really see a difference from when I was using this and when I wasn't. The fragrance is also very overpowering and not my favorite. To me, not worth dealing with for the ingredient list, fragrance, and price. There is definitely a better alternative out there."

I have to say while I enjoyed every bit of using this product I think I could provide a much more thorough and accurate review If I was able to use more of the product over a longer time span. I really liked incorporating this into my skin care routine for the time I had it. I think it was lightweight, easy to use, and has great potential for improving my skin’s texture."
