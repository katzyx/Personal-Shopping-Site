How to Use: Suggested Usage:.-Fragrance is intensified by the warmth of your own body. Apply in the creases of your knees and elbows for a longer-lasting, stronger scent.&nbsp;.-After applying, avoid rubbing or dabbing skin. This breaks down the fragrance, causing it to wear off more quickly.&nbsp;.-If you prefer placing fragrance on your wrists, be sure to reapply after frequent handwashing, as this tends to rinse off the scent.&nbsp;.-Replace fragrance after 12 months. Expired perfumes more than a year old lose the integrity of the original scent... Eau de Toilette or Eau de Parfum?: .The difference lies in the volume of perfume oil. While EDT contains five to nine percent, EDP contains more, usually eight to 14 percent. EDPs, therefore, last longer and smell more intense...Recycling Instructions:.-The box, bottle, and cap are 100 percent recyclable. .-When the bottle is empty, remove the cap and pump, then wash thoroughly. .-Recycle the bottle and cap and place the pump in the trash..-The box is made of sustainable Forest Stewardship Council-certified paper; please place it in the recycling bin.
