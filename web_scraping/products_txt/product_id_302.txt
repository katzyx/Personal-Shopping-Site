How to Use: - Spritz 1-2 times directly on the pulse points, such as your wrists, inner elbows or sides of the neck. Pulse points are warmer areas of the body that act as natural diffusers when emitting a scent. .- After application, allow the scent to air dry. Rubbing or dabbing will break down a fragrance and cause it to wear off more quickly. .- If you wear fragrance on the wrists, be sure to reapply after frequent hand-washing. .- Properly store your bottle to extend its shelf life, including recapping after each use and avoiding direct sunlight.
