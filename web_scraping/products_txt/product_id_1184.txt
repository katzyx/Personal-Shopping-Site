About: Fragrance Family:Floral.Scent Type:Fruity Floral.Key Notes:Rose de Grasse, Himalayan Jasmine, Pear.Fragrance Description:This spirited, fruity-floral eau de parfum captures the evolution of a poppy flower from bud to blossom by blending rose de Grasse and hints of Himalayan jasmine with the luscious aromas of pear, raspberry, and apricot..About the Bottle:Inspired by the works of 18th-century British artist Mrs. Mary Delany, NEST New York founder Laura Slatkin collaborated with master perfumers to translate these works of art into luxurious perfumes that capture the essence of each of the botanicals that adorn the products' striking packaging..About the Fragrance:Laura Slatkin has always found inspiration in the flower market. One day she came across these very large, unattractive buds. She learned they were poppy buds. Week after week, she noticed this ugly bud evolve into an extraordinary flower. This evolution became her inspiration for Wild Poppy.

How to Use: Suggested Usage:.-Fragrance is intensified by the warmth of your own body. Apply in the creases of your knees and elbows for a longer-lasting, stronger scent.&nbsp;.-After applying, avoid rubbing or dabbing skin. This breaks down the fragrance, causing it to wear off more quickly.&nbsp;.-If you prefer placing fragrance on your wrists, be sure to reapply after frequent hand-washing, as this tends to rinse off the scent.&nbsp;.-Replace fragrance after 12 months. Expired perfumes more than a year old lose the integrity of the original scent... Eau de Toilette or Eau de Parfum?: .The difference lies in the volume of perfume oil. While EDT contains five to nine percent, EDP contains more, usually eight to 14 percent. EDPs, therefore, last longer and smell more intense.
