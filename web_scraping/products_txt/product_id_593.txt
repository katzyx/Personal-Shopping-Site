It is crafted in-house at Glossier; it has the real thumbprint indent of the designer. So just like the scent, the bottle of Glossier You Ru00eave is unfinished. It needs you to hold it to complete it..About the Fragrance:Impressions of You are not scents you wear to become someone else. Instead, they are skin-scent enhancers, meaning they smell a little bit differently on everyone. With musky, warm ambrox and ambrette base notes that wear close to the skin, they let you leave your unique impression.
