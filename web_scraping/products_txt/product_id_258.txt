Repeat as necessary. ..-Shape brushes and allow to air dry completely before using..... Precautions:..-Flammable: Keep away from open flame. ..-Do not swallow, and avoid contact with skin and eyes. ..-If swallowed, do not induce vomiting and seek medical attention. ..-Keep out of reach of children.
