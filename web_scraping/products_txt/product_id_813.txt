About: What it is:.Fragrance Family:Woody & Earthy.Scent Type:Warm Woods.Key Notes:Cetalox (Synthetic Ambergris).Fragrance Description:This innovative yet simple mist captures the scent of bestseller Not A Perfume. A continuous atomizer spray application is designed to be environmentally friendly. It is ideal to use alone or as a fragrance booster as it will intensify the trail of any fragrance you mix it with.
Ingredients: Aqua (Water), Peg-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Parfum (Fragrance), Sodium Benzoate, Citric Acid, Sodium Hydroxide, Citronellol.
How to Use: Suggested Usage:.-Fragrance is intensified by the warmth of your own body. Apply in the creases of your knees and elbows for a longer-lasting, stronger scent.&nbsp;.-After applying, avoid rubbing or dabbing skin. This breaks down the fragrance, causing it to wear off more quickly.&nbsp;.-If you prefer placing fragrance on your wrists, be sure to reapply after frequent hand-washing, as this tends to rinse off the scent.&nbsp;.-Replace fragrance after 12 months. Expired perfumes more than a year old lose the integrity of the original scent... Eau de Toilette or Eau de Parfum?: .The difference lies in the volume of perfume oil. While EDT contains five to nine percent, EDP contains more, usually eight to 14 percent. EDPs, therefore, last longer and smell more intense.
