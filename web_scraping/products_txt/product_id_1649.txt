Ingredients: 
How to Use: Suggested Usage:.-Use the Slant Tweezer to eliminate unwanted brow hair under and above your desired eyebrow shape and the Point Tweezer for removing fine or ingrown hairs..-Start by opening pores using a warm washcloth. (Not too hot or it can cause redness.) This will help get your hair ready for removal and can help reduce pain..-Hold the tweezers using your thumb and index fingers near the middle of the tweezer body for maximum control..-After locating the unwanted hair, grab the tweezer tips slanted at a 25-degree angle and squeeze down on the body of the tweezer, pulling in the direction of hair growth. This will remove the hair from the root..-Continue until you have removed all unwanted hair. .-Avoid over-tweezing by pairing with a Tweezerman mirror and using good lighting.                                          -Clean tweezer tips after each use with alcohol wipe or peroxide. Tweezer can be sanitized in an autoclave or barbicide.
