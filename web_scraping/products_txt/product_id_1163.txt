How to Use: Suggested Usage:.- Start application where the strongest color impact is desired; the strongest color payoff will be at the first point of brush contact to skin..- For a natural rush of color, gently buff color onto skin using sweeping circular motions with NARS #16 Blush Brush for more color payoff, or NARS Yachiyo Brush for softer color payoff (brushes sold separately)..- For a seamless pop of color, layer two shades of Blush. Start with a base color in a shade that gives a subtle color to the cheeks. Layer a brighter shade in a similar tone on the apples of the cheek, then blend edges to diffuse into base color.&nbsp;.- For a touch-up or additional coverage, use a stippling motion when applying Blush to press color onto skin without disrupting coverage already created..- Can't get enough?
