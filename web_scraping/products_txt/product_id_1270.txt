How to Use: Suggested Usage:.- Start by using the dense end of the Patrick Ta Dual Ended Sculpting Brush (sold separately) to apply the creme with a gentle, stamping motion to create definition.- Using the fluffy end of the Dual Ended Sculpting Brush, layer the powder bronzer over areas where the creme has been applied to buff out any harsh lines and add warmth to the skin, focusing on areas where the sun would naturally hit the face.&nbsp;.- To contour the nose, apply the same technique using the Major Sculpt Dual Ended Precision Nose Contour Brush (sold separately)
