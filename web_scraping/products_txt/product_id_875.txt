About: Fragrance Family:Warm & Spicy.Scent Type:Warm & Sweet Gourmands.Key Notes:Cognac, Tonka Bean and Oak Wood.Fragrance Description:The Angels‘ Share Eau De Parfum contains the essence of cognac derived from the liquor to lend it a natural caramel color. It opens with cognac oil upon a blend of oak absolute, cinnamon essence, and Tonka bean absolute, and the scent‘s long-lasting notes of sandalwood, praline, and vanilla make for a delicious finish..About the Bottle:The perfume bottles in The Liquors collection are styled as a speakeasy essential, like an art deco glass to recall the most fabulous bars. The weighted glass is engraved with the emblematic K motif to throw and catch light at all angles and finished with a golden, diamond-shaped plaque signed in white serigraphy. These details bring to the Kilian Paris creation a guarantee of luxury that should not be ephemeral but should last a lifetime. As such, this perfume is refillable..About the Fragrance:This fragrance is part of The Liquors collection. Kilian Hennessy wanted to pay tribute to his heritage as heir to the renowned French cognac family.

How to Use: Suggested Usage:.-Fragrance is intensified by the warmth of your own body. Apply in the creases of your knees and elbows for a longer-lasting, stronger scent.&nbsp;.-After applying, avoid rubbing or dabbing skin. This breaks down the fragrance, causing it to wear off more quickly.&nbsp;.-If you prefer placing fragrance on your wrists, be sure to reapply after frequent hand-washing, as this tends to rinse off the scent.&nbsp;.-Replace fragrance after 12 months. Expired perfumes more than a year old lose the integrity of the original scent... Eau de Toilette or Eau de Parfum?: .The difference lies in the volume of perfume oil. While EDT contains five to nine percent, EDP contains more, usually eight to 14 percent. EDPs, therefore, last longer and smell more intense.
