About: Fragrance Family: Warm & Spicy..Scent Type: Warm & Sweet Gourmands..Key Notes: Cold Milk, Mahogany Wood, and Marshmallow..Fragrance Description: Seeking comfort in the familiar, this creamy and calming scent offers the perfect start to the day. Cold Milk adds a cooling element to an otherwise rich and warm fragrance of marshmallow, mahogany wood, and tonka bean...About the Bottle: The Expressive Collection is an homage to Commodity’s classic black-and-white bottles. The similar look reflects that Commodity’s original formulations are now housed within the Expressive Scent Space, and that these middle ground perfumes are the perfect balance of plus and minus...About the Fragrance: I was inspired by the memory of a family vacation in the fall, when we spent hours around fires, telling stories and making s’mores.

How to Use: Suggested Usage:.-Spritz one to two times directly on the pulse points, such as your wrists, inner elbows, or sides of the neck. .-Pulse points are warmer areas of the body that act as natural diffusers when emitting a scent..-After application, allow the scent to air dry. .-Rubbing or dabbing will break down a fragrance and cause it to wear off more quickly..-If you wear fragrance on the wrists, be sure to reapply after frequent handwashing..-Properly store your bottle to extend its shelf life, including recapping after each use and avoiding direct sunlight... Eau de Toilette or Eau de Parfum?: .The difference lies in the volume of perfume oil. While EDT contains five to nine percent, EDP contains more, usually eight to 14 percent. EDPs, therefore, last longer and smell more intense...Recycling Instructions: .-While Commodity works toward fully recyclable packaging, most of your fragrance can currently be recycled. .-Box, paper notecard, and pulp tray should be recycled as paper. .-Glass bottle and metal pump should be recycled as glass. .-Cellophane and bottle cap should be thrown in the trash.
