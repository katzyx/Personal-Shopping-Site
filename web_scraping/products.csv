A dry skin surface is particularly important because it allows the Personal Microderm to work properly and effectively. If the skin is damp or clammy, the disc will be unable to smoothly glide over the skin.              ..-For the first treatment, use the white training disc on the neck as well as the body to test how the skin will react to treatments from the Personal Microderm. This step does not need to be repeated beyond the first treatment...-Use a free hand to pull the skin tight in the treatment area...-Move the Personal Microderm in an upward motion across the skin. Do not make more than two passes over one area during the treatment. Keep the tool moving quickly: do not hover. ..-Following the treatment, use a toner to neutralize the ph balance in the skin and a recovery moisturizer. ..-Let your skin recover. Wait six to seven days between treatments. The tool removes the dead layer of skin and by doing so, your body needs to regrow new skin cells.","https://www.sephora.com/productimages/sku/s1769736-main-zoom.jpg?imwidth=465","https://www.sephora.com/ca/en/product/personal-microderm-P414662?skuId=1769736&icid2=products"

Apply in the creases of your knees and elbows for a longer-lasting, stronger scent.&nbsp;.-After applying, avoid rubbing or dabbing skin. This breaks down the fragrance, causing it to wear off more quickly.&nbsp;.-If you prefer placing fragrance on your wrists, be sure to reapply after frequent handwashing, as this tends to rinse off the scent.&nbsp;.-Replace fragrance after 12 months. Expired perfumes more than a year old lose the integrity of the original scent... Eau de Toilette or Eau de Parfum?: .The difference lies in the volume of perfume oil. While EDT contains five to nine percent, EDP contains more, usually eight to 14 percent. EDPs, therefore, last longer and smell more intense.","https://www.sephora.com/productimages/sku/s2729713-main-zoom.jpg?imwidth=465","https://www.sephora.com/ca/en/product/vanilla-sex-P508293?skuId=2729713&icid2=products"
