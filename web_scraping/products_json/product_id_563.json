I get compliments every time I use it! It is the only straightener that has ever come close to taming my hair.

I liked how light and easy it was to figure out when it was on, heating up and then turned off with the beeps. Unfortunately, the top temperature that the iron heats up to is not hot enough for my hair. If it was 10-15 degrees hotter it would be perfect. When it comes to touching up my hair where there might be a little frizz it does not work unless I leave the iron on heating up for a good 15 minutes and the reason why I removed a star. I can appreciate the iron being at a lower, fixed temperature to reduce heat damage but being that my hair is a medium hair type, a little higher of a temperature would be ideal. I think if you have fine hair this would work great. Medium to a little more coarse you would have to work on it."

What I liked about this one is the temperature stays the same one setting so it never gets too hot or burns your hair. And it's still rapidly straightened my thick hair which I wasn't expecting! My hair stayed very soft and straight. An image posted below is me starting to straighten my hair so you can see what it looks like beforehand. I may try doing a slight wave to the end but for the most part this is just a great straightener for getting the soft straight look I want for date nights and for time to time. Do make sure that it is lit up and warming up after you plug it in I thought I'd turned it on the first time and it wasn't heating but I had to move the button and make sure it lit up!

Cons:  Compared to my past flat iron, this model doesnu2019t have heat settings, just one simple on/off. The power button is in an odd place between the two plates.  Pros: Despite only one setting, I can appreciate the simplicity of the design. Maybe itu2019s because I was upgrading from a tool that was years and years old, but nonetheless the plates felt much more smooth on my hair. Only a light touch was needed, didnu2019t need to clamp down and hold or go over sections multiple times."

I have shoulder length type 2 wavy hair. It smoothly glides through my hair for both curling and straightening without any of the pulling/dragging that I have had from other ones. The rounded edges are a DREAM for curling which is what I do most with my flat irons. It is super quick to heat up that from the point of plugging it in and pressing the on button to being done, it takes less than 2 minutes to curl all of my hair into beach waves. It's now the fastest of all the hair heat tools that I own. The audio sounds it makes when plugging it in and turning it off helps me know/remember that I actually turned it off before leaving the house which is really nice. (It does also have the auto shut-off safety feature in the case I do ever forget.) I thought I was going to be disappointed that it only has one temperature, but I actually liked it better than having numerous settings. I didn't have to guess which temp would be best for each style and, most importantly, it helped me not fry my hair as it only took one pass to straighten or curl. Overall 10/10 - new holy grail product for me!"

I've always been an avid believer that more expensive doesn't always mean better results, and have sworn by my Remington hair straightener for years. Turns out, I had been living in blissful ignorance, because after using this product regularly for the past month I know I can never go back to any other hair straightener.   This flat iron is amazing start to finish. The product itself is lightweight and easy to hold. It also boasts a long cord that gives you space to reach the hard-to-get spots of your hair, while also leaving enough room at the bathroom mirror for your SO too.   Using it is incredibly simple too. There is only one heat setting, so just press the power button to turn it on. Less than a minute later it will indicate that it's ready for use. Now, with my old styler it would take me a minimum of two passes to get my hair perfectly straight. I chalked it up to the fact that I have long, thick hair that gets frizzy the moment someone so much as looks at it. With this styler my hair is done in one pass, and doesn't feel like I've burnt out all of the moisture either. My straightening time has decreased from over half an hour to 15 max, which is great for when I'm on the run or rushing to work.   I do see where there can be downsides though. For example, there is only one heat setting. For me, its the perfect heat. Though it may be too strong for those with thinner hair, or not strong enough to finish in one pass for those with curly hair. When purchasing a big ticket item like this, these things should be considered so that you know what you're getting yourself into in advance.   Bottom line, I'd absolutely recommend this product. Its sleek, efficient, and provides amazing results."

Ok so recently I received ghd's,  The Original STYLER aka  The Cult Classic  compliments of influenster and I'm loving it!! Im a single mother with long yet very thin hair. Not only do I have the list of everyday chores one does daily  I also have a 5 year old son whom requires to be homeschooled and needs Mommy's full attention at all times. I stay pretty busy but like most of you I'm a woman and I like to feel like one. I dont usually have the time to make myself feel like I'd like to, so receiving The Original Styler was like a blessing for me. I honestly don't believe I could ask for anything better let alone of this quality. It has an 8.8ft cable which is great  because let's face it some of my, feeling like a woman time ends up taking place while mommy is being a teacher as well. There's also a sleep mode that starts when it's inactive after 30 seconds, which is a giant plus for when I have to take a moment to sit and do a little hands on explaining. I can not get over the fact that the floating plates are built in so snug into the rounded barrel that my extremely thin hair has yet to snag and best of all ladies and gents it's totally versitile. The Classic Cult sets at 365u00b0 so for those of you whom only use your flat iron to straighten your hair... LIVE A LITTLE!!! it only takes an extra second to make your hair wavy or even curly. So there it is your search is over... It couldn't possibly get any better than this!!!!!!"

The styler heated up very quickly, and was seamless to use. The straightening process was quick and easy, with minimal heat needed. With other tools I have had to turn the heat settings all the way to max, which can damage hair very quickly. Luckily this styling tool doesnu2019t require that damaging level of heat to deliver great styling results.   I also had great success with curling, using this tool as well.  The versatility of this tool was a huge plus. Being able to use one heat styling tool for curling and straightening can eliminate the need for a separate curling iron, once you get the hang of the curling technique.   It is compact and light weight. Easy to handle and would be a breeze to pack in luggage for a trip as well.   I would definitely recommend the GHD Original Styler for anyone looking for a high quality, versatile, lightweight styling tool. It is a great product!"

I love that there's one heat setting that is perfect for all hair types - I honestly second-guessed this, but it really straighens my hair.  Also I love that it beeps when plugged in, again when turned on and beeps once turned off.  My hair does not snag on the plates and runs smoothly between them - a huge game changer! I notice less breakage and my hair shines and feels soft once finished. I will say it can be versatile - I use flat irons for straightening my hair & curling irons/wand for other styles.  I tested a few strands for curls and my hair didn't tangle, but with more practice I could use it for such."

I just wish there were temperature options - even my cheaper straighteners have temp settings. But this one is one mystery temperature. I like to make sure I'm not using too high of a heat on my hair and I have no way of knowing what this goes to.  I was not very impressed with the feel of the plates as they traveled down my hair. I have a $100 Chi that feels so smooth against my hair so I was hoping this would be comparable. Unfortunately, it felt like it was tugging individual hairs...

It was quicker to curl, the curls were more uniform and lasted longer than the curls from the other iron. 24 hours later with no product used, I only needed to slightly touch up a couple.

It worked magic on my sister's curly hair too, she loved and she bought her own! If you watch a few how to curl hair with this straightener videos you'll be able to get the hang of it, there's no need to use a curling iron and straightener. Plus it heats up in 30 seconds, that's quick! This straightener is ready when you are! There's no temperature control, one temp fits all. Yes it does. At first I didn't think one temperature would work for curly coarse hair until I tried it on my sister's hair. But the temperature is perfect. With my course thick hair this flat iron has been wonderful gliding through my hair without any pull. The plates are hot enough to create beach waves or cute curls and multiple other styles plus with a hair product it holds all day. Also it's easy to travel with, no matter what style I'm preparing for. I don't need any other electronics ie: curling irons etc. Yes It is alittle pricey but it has great benefits and the ceramic plates are top notch. It really is outstanding and superior to other products I've bought. There's no comparison to the stuff sold at my neighborhood store. This is the answer to all my hairstyle needs! So absolutely I would recommend the GHD flat iron. And don't forget to watch some of the YouTube videos for more creative hairstyles. Courtesy of influenster"

I do wish the hot plates were slightly bigger so I could do bigger sections at once. But this will definitely be my new go to straightener!"

I have fine and thick wavy hair that takes a long time to straighten.  The ghd styler says it gets to 365 degrees max. (Iu2019ve used a Chi for years and it goes to 425 degrees.)  This styler heated up fast!  I was delighted when it only took a pass or two through my hair with the ghd styler to get it straight!  It works as well as my straightener that gets hotter.  My hair was silky and smooth also.  I love the musical on/off button!  The safety auto-off that it has after 30 minutes is great in case the styler is accidentally left on.  The ghd original styler has a super long cord which is a lifesaver when youu2019re trying to get ready and multitask.  The only thing I would improve is the thickness of the straightener.  It is thicker than the one I was using so there is a learning curve.  It doesnu2019t feel as sleek and manageable in my hands.  That might not bother others."

I have used the InStyler to straighten and give some body to my hair for years and love it for that, but I hate using it for curls. I love the look of beachy waves and wish that I had the skill to create some Hollywood glam curls, but have never been able to achieve these looks with any tools that I have tried, the curls always turn out too tight or poof out and the process take way too long. I have noticed beauty influencers using these GHD stylers to effortlessly create a variety of curled looks, Iu2019ve been interested but was skeptical of anything that looked that easy and had held off purchasing one for myself so was so excited to receive one to try out. The first attempt wasnu2019t great because I didnu2019t know what I was doing, but after watching a few friendly instructional videos I found on Youtube that explained how to twist the hair and pull it through, I couldnu2019t believe how easy it really was. I can fully curl my hair in under 10 minutes or throw in some beachy waves in under 5, just a quick twist, pull right through and immediate results! No more holding or burning fingertips! Itu2019s a game changer for me, curls used to be reserved for special occasions because of the time and effort they took, but now I rock them whenever I want. The styler itself is a matte black sleek design thatu2019s just the right size for twisting around without being heavy or bulky, it has a 9ft long cord offering extra mobility, and heats up very quickly. I absolutely love this and am so excited to continue to perfect using it to create different looks. I have already suggested it to all my friends and family and would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a styler."

When I tried it the first time I was surprised at how smooth it glides over my hair. I have extremely thin, fine, and curly hair, so itu2019s difficult to find flatirons that will style my hair without pulling it out. I appreciate that the heat is controlled to a temperature that is not too harsh so I can minimize damage that comes with heat styling. (It also heats up extremely quickly, which is great since Iu2019m always in a hurry!). The width of the clamps is perfect to curl my hair as well. The only con Iu2019ve found so far is that because of the controlled temperature, my hair will get frizzy in extremely humid climates. This isnu2019t uncommon for me because of my curly hair, but just something to keep in mind. Overall, this is great for everyday use, but if Iu2019m going to a special event, or the beach, etc. I will probably use one that has higher heat settings."

The straightener does heat up very fast and it did do a nice job straightening my hair. I wish that there were hotter temperatures available because I did not feel that my hair got super straight with the 365u00b0 temperature. It would be nice to have different settings.

So this is one thing I didn't like. You can't set what temperature that you want the flat iron to be set it to. The flat iron does however does work well for my hair. I did have to go over a some pieces a few times to get them straight. This flat iron did make my hair so shiny and smooth after I was done using it.

I was very surprised and didnu2019t realize how slow my old one is. It will beep to let you know itu2019s ready which is nice. It has kinda big (ish) rounded barrel and thought it would be hard to work with in the front, but I had no problem getting as close as I need to and get those baby hair straightened. And the round barrel might be great for curls. I tried but failed. Iu2019m just not good at using straightener for curling hair but can see how someone might like that and illuminate an extra tool just for that. I will stick to hot rollers and curling wands though. I do use flat iron to curl the end of my hair though.  This one did not leave any weird creases like my old one does (user error in sure but this one made it easier to work with due to its round barrels). It never tagged or pulled my hair which happened from time to time on my old one, and I couldnu2019t stand that. Major plus for that!   The cons: it only has one temperature and I both like it and dislike at the same time. I like it because it is probably easier on your hair and less likely to burn yourself, but I had to run it a few times (2,3, even 4 times) to get the desired affect. With my old one, i only had to do one pass. So, it takes longer for me to do my hair. Another con, the instructions (I know! Who even reads those lol) says to not wrap the cord around the tool but rather fold it the same way it came out of the box to prolong the life span of it. Itu2019s a pain to fold the cord and it came with no Velcro to help to hold the cord together. I tossed the little wires that it came with right away, and donu2019t see anyone keeping those. So now i need to either find something else to hold it all in place or just continue to wrap it around the tool against the advice. Also, by folding the cord instead of wrapping it around, it leaves the flat iron opened, i donu2019t like that for storage reasons."

It says it takes 30 seconds to heatup, but it takes even less than that. And Iu2019d say it cools down in about thirty minutes or so. I have thick thick long beach waves so it usually takes me a while to straighten my hair, but this straightener easily has cut that time in half. It leaves your hair feeling shiny and smooth, with very little frizz considering you are straightening your hair. I canu2019t curl my hair so I wasnu2019t able to do that, but Iu2019d be willing to bet you can use this to make loose curls. If i had to improve anything Iu2019d say for the price I think it needs to come with a heat resistant storage sleeve. I was more than able to create the hairstyle I desired, and i even straightened it to put my hair in pig tails and it made it sooo much easier."

The only thing suggestion that I have is to add the ability to control the temperature of the device.

The plates are nice and smooth so your hair doesn't get as static-y and frizzy. One heat setting, but that's ok. I definitely recommend using a heat protectant spray. What I love is that i can touch the plastic part to kind of clamp down with my other hand if needed without burning myself. I couldn't do that on my older iron. Also, I love that it turns itself off after 30 minutes. Sometimes I forget to turn it off so that gives me peace of mind. Definitely worth the price!"

It has a little on button that flashes white as it heats up, and then dings and stops flashing when the hair straightener is at full temperature. I realize that it's just a flashy button, but I was pretty stoked in general! I set a timer to see how quickly it heats up: 17 seconds. From cold to fully ready to blast your hair into straightened submission, 17 seconds. Woah! And it gets crazy hot, I only had to run the straightener down my niece's type 2b hair once for pin straight locks. I did have to be careful around her roots, because  it's so hot that it's easy to leave indents even from a brief swipe down the strand. My only suggestion to make it better would be an option to control the temperature. But despite that, this is definitely a rocking hair straightener! (:"

This flat iron is very simple, just turn it on. It heats in literal seconds! It straightens almost as fast! My hair is medium length and naturally a little wavy. I was able to straighten my hair in less than 5 minutes (versus the 15+ minutes it took with my old straightener that needed to rest a few minutes to get hot again). My only minor complaint is that it did feel like it pulled my hair ever so slightly instead of just sliding through. My hair was also a little staticky after, but I just put a little product in and it was fine."

However, after trying the ghd original 1 styler, I am kicking myself for not having upgraded to this sooner!  There are so many improvements and benefits to this styler over my old one.  First, it heats up sooooo fast! It is ready to use within seconds of turning on, instead of minutes. The ceramic plates are pre-set to the safer-for-hair-temperature of 365u00b0F for sleek and smooth results with no extreme heat, which means no more damaged hair.  The plates maintain this temperature throughout the styling process so there is no need to take breaks in between sections u2013 such a time saver. The barrel of the styler is rounded to help create a wavy look if that is what you are going for.  The cord is super long, which makes it easy to reach all parts of my hair, and the floating plates help the styler just glide down my hair without pulling or getting caught. Looks like I will be retiring my old flat iron and sticking with the easy to use ghd original to make my hair look fantastic in much less time."

For example it makes a sound when you plug it in, but then it played a few more notes later. Did that mean it was hot already? Unclear, so I waited longer. It just has an on/off button, but that is because it only heats to one temperature.   The iron is a good size for the hand and nice and light. I do not often straighten my hair, but this is much lighter than a chi and some of the other brands. From one swipe down a wave, it made an obvious difference. I then did it a few more times and got it very straight, like a professional. I tried to do a curl with the iron and I was terrible at the technique, but I could see this iron working perfectly for that.  When I went to turn it off pushing the button, it did not turn off so I unplugged it. The lack of instructions is a bit concerning, but ultimately self explanatory I hope. It did give off a weird smell, but so far I have used it once so I hope that also disappears with time. I do recommend this iron!  I received this product free from Influenster for my honest review."

Before getting this iron, I had only ever owned cheaper hair tools since I figured it couldnu2019t be THAT much of a difference in performance. I was completely wrong! The GHD original styler is far better than all of the other flat irons Iu2019ve used in the past. It heats up very quick, which is great when youu2019re rushing to get ready, and I love the audio cues it makes to let you know when itu2019s hot versus when itu2019s been turned off. The nearly 9 foot cord is a bit excessive in my small bathroom, but it is nice to have that much wiggle room when working. Finding an outlet within reach shouldnu2019t be an issue! The ceramic plates are super smooth and didnu2019t tug on or catch my hair at all. It glided effortlessly and I never needed more than one quick pass to straighten a section. My hair is medium-thick and I was really surprised at how fast I was able to do my whole head despite the plates only being 1u201d. I was also impressed by how long my hairstyle lasted throughout the day. Iu2019m used to my hair getting a bit of a wave to it around the 5 hour mark, but with this iron my hair stayed pin-straight all day. I used all the same products I normally use; the only difference was this flat iron. I have also had some success curling my hair with it, although I definitely need more practice! Overall I think the GHD original styler is a great product. I do wish there were a handle lock for easier storage but it isnu2019t a huge deal. Definitely recommend!"

I loathe any time spent having to style my hair so much that I recently cut 8 inches off of it. I had intended to just let it dry, fluff, and have the curls fall where they may. I received this styler and decided I would (once again) give a straightener the benefit of the doubt. I wish I had this before I cut the eight inches off. It heats up in seconds, notifies you when it is hot, and automatically powers down if you are not using it. I have always struggled with straighteners actually working on my hair. My stylist can do it with her expensive straightener. This time, even I was able to get my hair the straightest it has ever been without scorching my hair. To be fairu2026those pictures will never see the light of day. My hair is so short that I now look like a boy with straight hair. So I moved past that and used it to add some dimension to my hair with a few passes of the wand with a slight curl. My hair is super short now. So I was nervous about burning my fingers. It was not a problem because the wand is smaller and fits easily in short hair. There is only one heat setting. I didnu2019t mind because I donu2019t think I would have turned it lower or higher at any point. The setting works well on my extremely curly hair. The only thing I would say is that I wish they would send a stand and/or heat bag to put these on while in use. I have quartz countertops. The wand seemed weighted and didnu2019t slip to the side on the counter while I was using it. A bag would offer reassurance when I travel with it. I am impressed and will buying it as a gift for my daughter and daughter in law."

I love the slick and modern design, 30 seconds to heat up, 1 inch plate in gold. I love the beep when you press one button and then the quick melody it makes to turn on. After 30 minutes it has an automatic timer to turn off. There is no way to adjust the temperature, it's automatically 365 degrees. I love that I am able to quickly straighten my hair or curl it using this lightweight styler! Super easy to do. I am not a professional when it comes to style but I love to experiment and play with my hair, this has been a really fun experience. Great for a special night out or event. Or every day use to straighten my hair. My hair that's going through a growing reprocess, appeared much healthier, smoother, silkier and as if I had added additional ingredients to my hair. I love the way it made me feel when I went out and got compliments on how my hair looks. To curl, I simply twisted one way and slid it down my hair or the opposite way and the same thing. It's pretty easy to use, my favorite thing about being a woman with curly hair is to straighten my hair as I feel like 20 lbs have been lifted off of my head(having thicker and curly hair). I also did notice it took me half the time it usually does to straighten my hair, which was quite surprising. One time down each strand and that's it!  Not to mention, it smoothes the frizzy hair which I tend to have and tames it! A couple of things I would add to improve this - I would add a protective package to place for travel and a hair clip to help when straightening or curling hair. I think that would be a bonus but overall I am quite impressed with this GHD original styler as it left my hair straightened for over 24 hours!!"

I wasnu2019t sure 365 would come close to straightening my hair, much less keeping it straight between washes. Well, I was wrong. This product is unbelievable. Heats up in seconds. Straightens my long hair with ease and keeps it straight between washes. I havenu2019t even had to do so much as a touch up. I like it so much, I also tried it out on my momu2019s hair. Her hair type is much different that mine. Itu2019s short and definitely not corse. Worked like a charm on hers as well. Leaves your hair feeling silky smooth and Iu2019m not sure I will go back to my old straightener again."

I have thick hair and it usually takes a while to straighten it, but the GHD styler gets the job done quick.

Minus 1 star due to safety. I'd appreciate how fast it heats up but 1) have to reach under the handle to turn off the on/off button.

It wasn't a one pass and done, but very few passes were needed.  3.) Whlie I didn't notice a texture difference after straightening, my hair did feel softer in the following days, even after washing.  Not sure why, but that was my experience.   CONS:  1.) The grip was different for me.  I have used the Babyliss for years and it is a much thinner profile.  I have Rheumatoid Arthritis and I noticed a difference in how my hands felt due to the grip.  2.) The plates are shorter than the Babyliss plates.  For comparison, the profile and plates of the GHD are very similar to my Chi. Overall a good straightener."

My natural hair is just a tad wavy in most places and kind of curly in the back. On the areas where my hair is just a little wavy I was able to straighten it with one pass using this iron, in curlier places it took up to 3. I thought this was great seeing as the straightener only gets up to 365 degrees. My one con with this iron is the heat blade are shorter than most other Ives used, so I had to work in smaller sections. This was particularly annoying when curling my hair because parts of my hair kept falling out of the iron if the section was too much. In the end, I still got the result I wanted it just took a little more work to get there. Overall Iu2019d say this is a great straightener, but just an ok curler"

My hair is on the thicker side, but the hair itself is pretty fine. It's down to the middle of my back with quite a few long and medium layers.  Also there is a slight wave to it if I were to just let it airdry, and holds a curl somewhat decent, but not the best. It is healthy with quite a bit of shine, I definitely prioritize taking care of my hair, for sure.   I try to use really good products on my hair, and that includes tools, so I usually have to save up for them, they tend to be pricey! Lol.  I have 2 straighteners from 2 very well known brands that both tug, catch, and pull breaking my hair... So, needless to say they are collecting expensive dust in my room.   When I got the opportunity to try this tool from GHD I was beyond excited, for once I didn't have to go without to get a quality tool.  I received it on Jan 24th and have used it almost every day since.  I'm actually having FUN doing my hair again. Zero tugging, pulling, or snapping my hair, glided through like butter, I even checked double checked to make sure it was on, because I felt nothing!!! Beachy waves was my first attempt.. couldn't have done better, they were perfect.  Also played around with curling patterns, straightening and the only disappointment I have is the fact I didn't get this a long time ago and wasted my precious money on 2 dust collected.  But I have it now and am putting my saved money towards a GHD curling wand.  I can't express my gratitude enough to Influenster and GHD for this opportunity.  Thank you thank you thank you"

First of all I am so grateful to ghd for allowing me to try their wonderful product. I was in need of a new straightener and this one just blew me out of the water!   I'll start by saying that I have back length thick hair it is somewhat fine but I have a lot of hair. I typically use a straightener that has the wider iron head in comparison to this one which is a very slim iron. Although it's slim and sleek it packs a punch as it is very powerful.   It comes in a very high end packaging that looks really expensive it also has a instruction manual and warranty information. The straightener and the cord feel very matte and smooth to the touch.  The straightener has one button you turn on so no need to fiddle with temperature and the button is in a discrete place inside the straightener so you don't inadvertently turn it off. Once it's been turned on it heats up within seconds it is lightning fast. The straightener is very sleek and lightweight perfect for traveling or just daily use.  It typically takes me at least 10 minutes to straighten my hair but with this one it takes me less than 2 minutes and my hair is perfectly straight and smooth so I can head out the door and start my day. I do use heat protection products as these straighteners do get very hot.   Overall I am very impressed with this product it does feel like something a professional salon would have but again I am so grateful to have tried this and this will be my go-to brand when purchasing hair products in the future.   Buy it you will not be disappointed!"

I'm not great at taming my curls just yet so I still love to straighten my hair. As far as flat irons go I've owned a Chi and HSI. I loved both of those for different reasons. I would say this GHD measured up. It's lightweight which is nice. It heats up crazy fast! Like 10 seconds maybe? I like the beep along with the indicator light to let me know it's ready to go. At first I was a little skeptical. It seemed like it was taking quite a bit of passes to fully straighten my hair but as I went on it did such a great job! Maybe it just needed a little time to break in but eventually it was up to my CHI expectations. Left my hair super soft and silky. My hair stays straight for a few days with a few touchups. I am really happy with this flat iron and it's going to be my go to here on out."

Make your hair straight or make those beautiful celebrity style curls throughout your hair. Not only does it look better but it makes me happier and it shines.

I can easily straighten my hair while creating curves. This will shorten my time in getting ready by a lot. Also the on button is located inside the iron. This will prevent me from turning it off while having my hand around the iron like some. Also, when turned on the on button will light up and create whimsical noise letting you know it's getting turned on. The only think I did not like is the fact that it does not have a temperature setting. I have thick hair and with this iron I have to pass it more than once through my hair to get it straight."

            "review_text": "I tested the ghd original styler on my 2A/2B hair, slightly damp and with a heat-protectant cream.  The box is sturdy and feels nice, definitely great for gift-giving and can be used to store the styler.  You plug the styler then hold the power button for a second, which lights up and makes a little sound. After only about 4 seconds, a little tune notifies that the styler is hot, which really helps with avoiding accidental burns. And it actually heats up that fast!! There is an initial burnt metal smell, but it dissipated quickly and I havenu2019t smelled it since.   This styler is HOT. It felt like I was sitting next to a heater. But for me, the intense heat did make styling more efficient! I definitely recommend using a heat protectant and keeping an eye on how your hair reacts to this styler!!  My personal method of straightening hair with this styler is to do a smooth downward swipe (not hold) on a section of hair, let the hair cool just until it is just warm and not scorching (you can tell), then repeat as necessary until the settled hair is styled as desired.   I found that holding the styler in one place will end up creating an indent, but it was surprisingly easy to smooth it over with another quick swipe. Holding the styler is great for some styles, like waves, and the indenting is just something to keep in mind when straightening hair.  I was surprised at how smooth, no-frizz, and soft my hair actually was afterwards. The strands werenu2019t crunchy at all, and they even flowed weightlessly like in a commercial! This ghd original styler worked great for me. The design is easy to wield without accidentally touching skin or straining your hands, and it doesnu2019t produce a cheap chemical/burnt smell.   Overall, I very much like it! If you have been looking for a styler and are willing to splurge on a product that actually works, this is a product that follows through on hype. It definitely feels like a quality product that can become anyoneu2019s favorite!"
