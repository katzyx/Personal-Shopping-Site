From the first week, I noticed a difference, which is unusual for me since most products take time to show results. Initially, I felt a bit of tingling when I applied it, but it went away quickly. I use it only at night, and by morning, my skin feels incredibly soft and glowy. It really does brighten and hydrate my face, giving it a fresh, dewy look.  When I ran out and saw the price for a replacement, I was shocked, but the visible results convinced me to buy it again. Iu2019m on my 4th jar now and still loving it. If it werenu2019t for Influensteru2019s recommendation, I might have never discovered this gem. Itu2019s definitely worth the investment!"

I checked the ingredients again and she was right.  so now I've been using it every morning and I'm truly in love with how glowy and beautiful it looks, especially with the new kheuls sunscreen.  I also love that it doesn't contain any silicone as my preference is water based over silicone which can be tough because MOST moisturizers and sunscreens have some form of silicone. both this one, and the kheils sunscreen do not have silicone and it makes my makeup look so much better matching the ingrediants. if it doesn't break me out I will be repurchasing"

I LOVE the omega repair cream for my drier days, but most of the time it's too heavy and I was looking for something lighter. Imo the repair cream is worth the price tag, as it feels so rich and luxurious on the skin in a way that no other cream has felt before. This gel moisturizer...yes it feels nice, it doesn't pill with my other products, it hasn't broken me out, and I like that it has fermented ingredients (if it's good for you internally surely it's likely to have external benefits too right?). It's not too heavy, plays well under my makeup, and seems to keep my skin nicely hydrated....but is it so much better than my Paula's choice gel moisturizer that the hefty price tag is justified?? Idk...they feel pretty darn similar/the effect is basically the same.   If you're just looking for something that will work with this kind of texture, then there are other cheaper alternatives out there that you'll probably enjoy just as much. But, if you're looking to/don't mind splurging then it's definitely a good product and I'd give it a try."

I like that this brand is clean beauty as well so I don't have to worry about anything irritating my sensitive skin. My favorite ingredient in this are the active probiotics to help balance my skins microbiome. So it's really perfect for all skin types. Although this is a morning and night moisturizer I have really enjoyed using this in the AM. I highly recommend this for anyone with sensitive skin. If your skin is generally irritated and red, this moisturizer will be the perfect soother.

Biossance Squalene and prebiotic gel moisturizer was just the right fit. Firstly it's a gel, therefore it is not as thick as your typical face cream; it's easily applied above your serums and eye cream and doesn't clump up. Secondly, it's perfect for sensitive skin, practically scent free. It is also extremely affordable- a little goes a long way, and within 1 week I noticed my face glowing and appeared plump. I would highly recommend this gel, my only tip is try to avoid if u live in hot areas where u tend to sweat a lot, because it might come off easily. It might also appear to burn if paired with preceded by Niacinimide."

I took off one star because I did find that with regular use, areas on my face with more sensitive skin (mostly on my cheeks) became a bit more sensitive/red. Overall however, I did notice that my skin was more hydrated, plump and softer. I really like the finish it leaves when itu2019s dried (very smooth, soft feeling on your skin) and foundation/concealer goes on smoother with this as a part of skincare."

It visibly calmed my skin and did minimize my redness. I think this would be great for someone with Rosacea (both my mom and grandma have it and so I will have it one day) and I like the thought of my moisturizer assisting with redness. Itu2019s a gel cream hybrid that feels really light and moisturizing when applied. I like to apply this after toner to my face and neck. It absorbs very quickly which I liked especially in the morning during my routine. Iu2019ve also applied it to my hands and dry spots and my skin felt soft and moisturized. It wore well under my spf and under make up. Iu2019ve had no irritation nor any breakouts since using this on my sensitive acne prone skin. It has a bit of a silicone smell but otherwise fragrance free.  I love that their sugar cane derived squalane saves 2 million sharks annually?! Awesome. I did not have a chance to try the previous formula of this product, but this current formula is a dream. The only reason I gave it 4 out of 5 stars is because of the runny consistency. It makes it very messy in the jar you go to get a little and you end up getting a lot and it can drip everywhere. Otherwise formula wise itu2019s definitely a 5 star product Iu2019d recommend."

I tried it for 2 weeks to test out the claim about reducing irritation redness, congestion, and sensitivity with the help of squalene and probiotics.  . As far as I could tell, my skin is definitely less red and stay quite moisture throughout the winter seasons. Though I got to experience a couple of days in extreme cold weather where I use heater a lot and that makes my skin much drier, this moisturizer is just quite not enough and I have to double up with a heavier cream.

It wasnu2019t necessarily burning or irritating, but I could feel my face get a little warm when applied. The sensation went away after a few minutes, but it still was not the most pleasant feeling. I liked how my skin felt afterwards, as it felt very hydrated and soft. However, I noticed a few new breakouts on my skin while using this product. This happens to me with many new skincare products, so I wasnu2019t too surprised.

Second, I donu2019t understand who this is for. I have dry skin and it felt like it was suppose to be hydrating but thereu2019s some lingering stickiness that did not feel good. It is also a gel which isnu2019t ideal for dry skin but also contains squalene so itu2019s like, who is this really for, bc if I had oily skin itu2019d feel terrible too.

First off, before even opening the moisturizer, the packaging is quite nice and feels luxurious. Iu2019ve tried this moisturizer a few times now and would probably not purchase this myself. Unfortunately, while itu2019s described as gel moisturizer, I personally think that it is more like a lotion and is too runny. I actually spilled this moisturizer twice because it is so runny. I have combination skin and it did absorb nicely but I feel that the title of the product is misleading. I am still very grateful to have received this product and plan to use it until it runs out but wanted to share my honest opinion. This is my opinion so you could still love it. I recommend reading other reviews before you decide."

Pros: Lightweight  No scent Semi gentle on skin  Can wear under makeup without it causing the foundation to separate  Leaves skin instantly hydrated  Cons: Packaging is my main complaint, itu2019s heavy and not easy to travel with. The product is so thin itu2019s almost a milky texture so if you travel with this product it gets very messy, stuck in the lid and is very runny so it can be messy to use. I think a pump bottle of some sort would be great for this product. Not easy to travel with, very heavy packaging Very thin, runny consistency that can be messy (as mentioned above)  Can burn or cause irritation on sensitive skin or damaged skin barrier.  Overall the pros outweighs the cons of this product and itu2019s working well for me!  I received this product for free from Influenster."

However, do not apply this to broken skin, as it resulted in a mild burning sensation.  A particularly commendable aspect of the Biossance moisturizer is its fragrance-free formulation. This is a significant plus for users sensitive to scents.   I have very dry, sensitive skin and this has not irritated it at all, which of in itself is a plus.  In conclusion, the Biossance Probiotic Gel Moisturizer is a high-quality product that delivers on its promises. Itu2019s particularly suitable for those who prefer a gel consistency but need more substantial hydration. The lack of fragrance and its non-irritating properties make it a safe choice for most skin types, though care should be taken when applying to broken or highly sensitive skin."

Still definitely on the higher end in terms of pricing for a facial cream but hey give it a try if it comes in a set. I would say also more for oily to combo skin types."

This means that you really donu2019t need to scoop out too much because as soon as you apply it, it just melts into your skin. I loved how cooling and refreshing this felt on my face. Itu2019s unlike any other product Iu2019ve used before, it felt reminiscent of a spa treatment. As for how my combination acne-prone skin reacted to this moisturizer, Iu2019m definitely a fan. My face looked so balanced and bright after application and the effect lasts throughout the day. I felt like this moisturizer was healing to my skin barrier honestly. My usual irritation around my breakouts and all signs of redness were nowhere to be found. While I wouldnu2019t have described my face as inflamed prior to this experience, I think the visible difference proves how much I needed this. I am very pleased at how this product lived up to its claims and I respect the brand even more for not overselling what this moisturizer can do.

It is still a gel, but itu2019s more milky, creamy, and rich than others iu2019ve tried so it really keeps my skin hydrated.

The moisturizer is water gel-based', not thick and absorbs well into the skin. The application is easy as it glides smoothly across the skin. There's no heavy fragrance that may cause irritations and a little product goes a long way. It's a great moisturizer for any time of the day because it doesn't leave any residue on the skin. During the day, it doesn't cause my skin to become oily and at night it's light enough where I don't have to worry about product going everywhere on my pillow. My face definitely feels dewy and refreshed throughout the day and night. My only criticism is that for the price, I do not feel like it's exceedingly better than other water-based moisturizers I've used. Although, I enjoyed using this product, knowing that there's similar moisturizers for almost half the price does deter me from wanting to purchase this in the future. However I still encourage others to give it a try to see for themselves."

I had received this moisturizer right in the beginning of the winter time when it was just getting colder. I decided to give it a try to see how it would hold up. Typically gel moisturizers are better for summer for me since they absorb easier but the squalene in the product gave me hope it would moisturize even in the colder times. Impressively enough it did hold out during the wind and cold. Mind you I prefer a THICKK moisturizer in winter since my skin gets a little peely. I peeled just a little around my eye area but for a gel moisturizer it did an impressive job. I did notice I was less oily but it was winter and I'm not as oily. In terms of redness I didn't notice too much of a difference (not as red during winter) but around summer I would probably pull it out again and see the difference in seasons. I also like how there isn't a heavy fragrance. The reason I took off a star was because even though this is an incentivized post i believe price point is important. It is a bit expensive but it is pretty on par with its other products so I can't complain too much. However there mission, product aesthetic, and packaging makes up the difference for me. If you need a summertime moisturizer, I would keep this in your back pocket. For winter if you peel like me maybe opt for something thicker but it still did the trick!"

Overall, I highly recommend this moisturizer for anyone seeking to soothe and hydrate sensitive or irritated skin, as it has become an essential part of my skincare routine."

Very watery gel like texture and no noticeable scent. I love gel moisturizers so this was a big win for me. Upon application it gives a slight dewy finish, like a glow from within type of look. Within a few minutes I noticed reduced redness and a soothing feeling. Not only does it minimize redness but I think it may minimize inflammation as well! The only reason I do not give it five stars is because I did notice that I get oily much quicker with this product than my usual lotion."

For $56/ 1.69 fl oz, it is still a good price (Cliniqueu2019s Moisturize Surge Line 72hr and 100hr run around this price point). It has beautiful packaging, and is well made so Iu2019m not afraid of dropping it or traveling with it (did just fine for the holidays). I waited to review this product for about a month, assuming it would be a stronger formulation. I have a 4fl oz sample of the Squalane + Copper Peptide Serum which I rotate in my skincare routine twice a week due to the strength of the ingredients; acids, proteins, vitamins etc. The Biossance Squalane and Probiotic Gel Moisturizer is more gentle- I can use it daily or twice daily without any reaction from my skin, but did use it every other night for the first week. It is soothing, does seem to reduce oil (very oily with dry spots) and looks like a thick cream but is a gel solution that needs to sit and sink into the skin a bit longer than a basic moisturizer. Since using it, my foundation has gone on much more smoothly, and the texture has decreased in problem areas, so while I donu2019t believe anything u201cshrinks poresu201d I do believe it is helping the skin barrier stay stronger. I am happy with the price point for the product for what it does, and am likely to purchase from Biossance again in the future. I expect it will last a good 3 months as very little is required (quarter sized dollop). *Received free from Influenster in exchange for my honest opinion and review*."

Upon opening the package, I was met with a very high-end container, which does that additional little click thing as you tighten it to keep your product from drying out. I believe the container may be made of glass, which is rather impressive at this price point.   The product itself is smooth and of a thinner consistency. This means I am able to apply lesser amounts of product and cover more ground with it, using less product overall.   There is no smell, thank God. Any sense or fragrances may irritate my skin, causing redness and irritation (I tend to struggle with that).   After trying this product for 2 weeks, I am absolutely blown away. No longer do I have a greasy residue all over my skin, and no longer do I have horrifically dry, irritated red skin.   The price point for this is rather decent as well.   10/10.

I will also be ordering this gel moisturizer once I start to get low. I also have noticed minor fading in the small red spots I have on my lower neck area, I believe it will only improve with continuous use.

This year Iu2019ve been trying to transition all of my makeup and skincare products to u201ccleanu201d brands so I was really grateful to receive this product! Most of my skincare is Good Molecules now, but I hadnu2019t yet switched moisturizers and was still using drugstore Neutrogena. This product was especially good for me because Iu2019ve recently been getting very greasy at night on my forehead and the tip of my nose from my go to moisturizer, and it was so much so that I stopped moisturizing at night because I was breaking out and would just finish with hyaluronic acid. This moisturizer did not break me out, and actually helped some really minor dry patches I get around my hairline and my eye lids in the winter. It goes on very lightweight and clear once rubbed in, but locks in all of my other skincare overnight. It also makes a great base for my makeup during the day. Overall Iu2019ve noticed my skin is more hydrated from being able to again use moisturizer at night and my small breakouts on my forehead and nose have gone and stayed away. 5 stars hands down."

For reference I am 27 years old with fair skin and I battle dryness and redness on a daily basis. My skin genuinely felt moisturized and noticeably looked hydrated immediately after application. Not only did it moisturize my skin it also caused no reaction and helped calm my redness. Additionally, I found this product to be significantly easy to apply. In the second picture, you can see the texture looks like a face cream but also a gel at the same time. I found it so easy to apply and that a pea size amount is all you need for application. Other aspect I would like to touch on is that Biossance mentions on this product that it can be used on face and neck at morning or night. This would be a great product for someone to introduce or to replace products in their beauty routine. Lastly, I would like to mention that the price is absolutely worth the quantity you receive. For $54 you can get 50ML/1.69FL. OZ . Comparable to other companies I say this is a fantastic deal because you can use this at day or night and it's a big size container. All day my skin has felt amazing and I highly recommend this to all skin types and genuinely believe it lives to its name for moisturizing ud83dudca6 and calming skin ud83dude4f. I received this product from Influenster to try and definitely see myself adding this product to my routine and buying Biossance in the future. ud83dude42"

I was a bit skeptical at first, but I'm not kidding, this stuff is amazing! My skin has never felt so soft and hydrated. The best part is that it's vegan and cruelty-free.

I've been a fan of Biossance for a couple of years now so when I received this moisturizer, I was excited to try it out! You can say I'm a skincare junkie so I love to test out new products!  First and foremost, this moisturizer doesn't have a nauseating scent so that's a +1 for me already. The texture is a nice cooling gel texture, great for those that need a moisturizer that's not too heavy on their skin.   This moisturizer is aimed at those suffering from dryness, redness, acne, and blemishes. Which I suffer from all of the above. I've been testing this product out for a week so far and I have to say, I like how my skin looks thus far. It calms my skin down especially in the morning when I wake up with a load of redness. My skin feels hydrated throughout the day, which is a plus. I can't say that my blemishes have faded yet since I haven't tested this product for too long, but what I can say is that I'm impressed with how well this moisturizer keeps my dry skin hydrated.  If you're looking for a new moisturizer to try out, definitely keep this one in mind if you're suffering from dryness or redness!"

Which immediately made me even more excited to apply it to my skin. After cleansing, it only took a small amount to moisturize my whole face. A little bit goes a long way! It goes on and blends so effortlessly leaving  my skin feeling so hydrated and nourished! I was pleasantly surprised to find that it also acted as a great primer for my makeup! Allowing my foundation to apply smoother and blend easier, keeping my skin feeling and looking awesome all day long! In such a short period of time, Iu2019m already noticing a significant improvement in my skinu2019s texture and overall appearance! My complexion looks more even and radiant, with a noticeable reduction in my usual redness and dry patches! Ive also noticed that my skin seems more balanced and less prone to breakouts since starting this! Overall, the Biossance probiotic gel moisturizer has become an essential part of my skincare routine. Its lightweight formula, nourishing properties, and incredible results have truly made a difference in the health and appearance of my skin. I couldn't be happier with this product and highly recommend it to anyone in search of a reliable and effective moisturizer."

I adore the feeling and slip of this gel moisturizer. My skin, which has rosacea and is dry and sensitive, looked beautiful and plump after using this product and did not experience irritation or redness. This product's jelly-like consistency, which feels remarkably light on the skin, is one of its best qualities. It absorbs quickly, leaving my face feeling nourished and renewed without leaving a greasy or heavy aftertaste. I really adore how well it functions as a smooth surface for simple makeup application when worn under makeup. I had amazing results with this moisturizer, especially now in the winter months when my heater is turned up to blasting hot drying out the air in the room. It didn't irritate my t-zone, give me pimples, or make it oily. It did the opposite, letting my skin breathe and leaving it feeling nourished and full all day. My skin absorbed this product immediately and it left my skin with a lightweight moisture. My skin feels wonderfully hydrated by gel moisturizer . My face feels amazing and is left feeling smooth, supple, and nourished. What is most important to me regarding moisturizers is the end result not leading to my skin seeming or feeling greasy, and this product ensures my desired results. The other very important quality I look for in a moisturizer is the product not causing me to  experience irritation or breakouts and this product did not cause those side effects I try to avoid. I would definitely purchase this product for a second jar or more."

One of the standout features of this product is its jelly-like consistency, which feels incredibly lightweight on the skin. Even in the sweltering heat, it is easily absorbed, leaving my face feeling refreshed and hydrated without any greasy or heavy residue. I also love how it plays well under makeup, acting as a smooth canvas for easy application.  Having sensitive combination skin, I am always cautious about trying new products. However, the Biossance Squalane Probiotic Moisturizer worked wonders for me - it didn't cause any breakouts or irritation, nor did it make my t-zone oily. Instead, it left my skin feeling plump and nourished throughout the day, while allowing my skin to breathe.  In conclusion, the Biossance Squalane Probiotic Moisturizer is a game-changer for anyone seeking a lightweight, non-greasy, and hydrating formula for even the hottest of days. Its luxurious packaging, jelly consistency, and skin-friendly properties make it an absolute winner in my books. I highly recommend it to anyone in need of a reliable, nourishing moisturizer that won't disappoint!"

The pore congestion is normal for me when it comes to moisturizing the T-zone simply just from being more susceptible on that part of my face, but that doesnu2019t have anything to do with the product. It works wonderfully to soothe without being too heavy, but I would consider this to be more of a day time moisturizer as it is on the lighter side.

But there are tons of other moisturizers on the market which tick all those boxes and cost much less and work just as well.  I will note that I don't have dry or sensitive skin and I don't have eczema.  I may have felt differently if my skin type were different. If your skin falls into one of the above categories, it might be worth a try. Otherwise? Save your money and buy something else."

Most serums donu2019t work for me only two Iu2019ve found make my skin better and the one from Biossance is my go to. So when I got this moisturizer for review I was excited to see the same ingredients that my skin loves but I wonu2019t lie I was worried when the consistency appeared to be so loose and runny. But after using it and giving it a real shot my worries were put at ease. A lot of moisturizers donu2019t work they leave me looking oily and gross because my skin although is insanely dry in areas also had a knack for going oily fast with certain moisturizers so Iu2019ve always struggled with serums and creams to find what moisturizes without leaving my skin looking like an oil slick. This runny consistency with its watery gel like texture is actually kind of perfect for my skin because a little goes a long way and itu2019s not thick and greasy itu2019s really light and feels like it really sinks in. I would say this moisturizer is good for all those with tough combination skin that get dry but also struggle with products that make them look too oily. This moisturizer leaves my skin looking healthy and plump. Like I drink a ton of water and just have good healthy skin. Itu2019s like a drink of water loaded with nourishing ingredients. I have yet to be disappointed by a product from Biossance. Iu2019ve used this for a couple weeks now and you canu2019t even tell Iu2019ve used it daily. Thatu2019s how well this one will last you really donu2019t need to overdo it. Itu2019s amazing."

This moisturizer works nicely under makeup too. It doesnu2019t make my makeup looks cakey or dry and it has made my combo skin looks less oily throughout the day. Even if my skin is more on the dry side recently this cream hydrates it well. This moisturizer leaves my skin soft and plumped.

This product claims to reduce redness and congestion, and I've found it does that excellently while giving my skin just the right amount of moisture. It's reasonably priced for what you get, and I've definitely noticed a change since I started using this product."

My skin usually suffers from redness and oiliness, and with the summer heat its no different. That's why I was so excited to receive this moisturizer.

After applying it in the morning with my skin care routine it sinked in fast with a semi-matt finish. My pores were the same but the redness was almost completely gone! Which made me very pleased with this product! Definitely will continue using it!"

My skin reacts to even a small poke, punch, etc. Especially when I sue a pimple popper my skin will welp up for a few hours after. I usually use a green tea mask that dries out the pours and calms my skin however this moisturizer has a lot of key ingredients that are key for what Iu2019m looking for. I have dry- barely oily, but always red and irritated skin. Iu2019m not sure if itu2019s my diet or just my natural complexion. It cracks, it swells, and it is always red in my T-zone.  To start, I appreciate the squalane is plant based- it works to help moisturize my skin and helps with anti-inflammatory issues, while not using squalane harvested from shark organs. Red seaweed and ginger extract is a huge win for my skin, it helps in this and other products I have to de-stress the appearance of my skin.  Prior to putting this on, I did my usual routine. I popped a few pimples, but decided to skip the green tea drying mask. I wanted to try this moisturizer because it claims to be u201cfast actingu201d, so I applied it in the u201cif case scenariou201d of me being in a rush to get out the door. Within the initial application my face felt cooled, and heavily hydrated. Though it took about 5-10 minutes before I noticed the pimples I had just popped actually seemed less red. It did not agitate them more as open pours and rather did calm them down. I work the moisturizer for the next 8 hours, and in the end went to sleep and woke up with my skin happy with me.   Overall extremely satisfied with my product, very happy with its performance, and would recommend to others. I personally will be buying it again, because despite the $54 price point, it has the key ingredients to help my personal red/agitated skin combination."

And the product has worked great, especially on soothing and healing a sensitive scrape I have from hiking. The moisturizer is very cooling and refreshing, so I am excited to see how it helps with sunburns this summer. My only flaw is how thin and lightweight it is as a gel since I tend to go for creams more. But if thatu2019s your thing, highly recommend!"
