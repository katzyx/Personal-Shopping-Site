I can't describe it but it makes me think of hippies lol. the only change I liked is the packaging. I dont like tub moisturizers and this one let's you choose whether you want the refill or tub."

It honestly doesn't have much of scent at all, maybe slight juniper scent but even that is hardly there and the vanilla is so weak is basically non existent. It just smells like regular unscented lotion, they really need to up the fragrance in this and make the vanilla sweeter. It's a good for moisturizing/layering if you just want somethig to pair perfume with but other than that there's other vanilla scents lotions and body butters that are better."

I actually HATE them because they've created the most delicious vanilla scent in this butter. I am NOT typically a vanilla scent girly - I find them incredibly basic and flat. NOT THIS ONE. The juniper berries and violet combined with the vanilla and cedar base notes make my eyes wanna roll back in my head. I see reviews complaining the smell is not great or not vanilla. Remember to take these with a grain of salt, as not everyone will have the same olfactory experience as you. I highly encourage you to smell this in store and buy the small travel size if you're unsure. Once I figure out which perfume to layer this with to make the smell last longer, IT'S SOOOOOOOOOO OVER!!!  Oh yeah, it's moisturizing and will leave a faint glow (no shimmer, just very emollient). Don't use in places you're prone to breaking out (e.g. back, butt). Lastly, I will never buy full size even though I am capable because that is egregious, unnecessary, and a little goes a long way."

Firstly the size I purchased (400ml) did not come with a jar. Although I wasn't happy about this, I figured id buy the size that came with the jar as well.  However after smelling the product I'm confused as to where the vanilla smell is. It give a slight smell of something in the beginning but the smell immediately leaves once applied and smells really strange almost like oil or a weird yogourt. Im not sure how to describe it. I tried to cover it with Kayla vanilla which I purchased to layer with the vanilla body butter however that didn't work. I took a shower to wash the product off and immediately returned it that day. Im going to try smelling the other scents in store maybe this one was just off.  as for the hydration it does work. very oily so don't use much product but my skin did feel amazing if it wasn't for the awful smell I would keep it. However I'll be returning both the scrub and the butter immediately.  if you live near a Sephora go into store before purchasing, I don't recommend buy this product online."

Itu2019s an average body butter at best but the reason why I gave it two stars was because it wasnu2019t as hydrating as I thought and as was advertised. It was also pretty greasy. Honestly, I think there are more affordable and more hydrating body butters out there"

Instead of the anticipated sweet vanilla, it leans towards a subtle sweetness that oddly reminds me of cheesecake. It's not what I expected, and though the scent may be overhyped, its hydrating qualities make it worth a repurchase."
