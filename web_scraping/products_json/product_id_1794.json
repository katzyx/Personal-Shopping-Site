It makes my makeup feel incredibly dry, it doesn't absorb any 'powderyness' if you like to set or bake with powder. Half way through the day my makeup cracks in any areas that my skin moves a lot(under my nose, smile lines, under and around eyes). I haven't tried this with foundation or concealer ONLY, but could see that possibly working better, or being good in really hot, sweaty conditions. The fragrance is a lot for something that you spray on your face which is offputting, and if you open your eyes too soon after spraying it BURNS. This is a big NO for me. Waste of money. And I will forever love my UD All-Nighter."

            "review_text": "'Hairspray for your face' were my first thoughts after seeing the ad, and it really IS like using a hairspray! I started out with the mini size, loved it and then moved up to the standard size which retails at a slightly expensive $32 for 3.4 oz/143ml. This makeup setting spray keeps its promises, it really does last and then some, which is no easy feat when my skin is at its oiliest! Oil aside, even perspiration barely makes a dent on how well my makeup holds up after using this. Obviously I'm not talking major sweating events, but the amount you'd typically see after a 10 minute walk on a warm/humid day. What I don't like however is the fact that the nozzle gets clogged up and stops dispensing. And after a quick search online, it seems I'm not the first person to be experiencing this either. Unfortunately this makes the remaining product unusable, which wouldn't be such an issue if it didn't cost this much to begin with! I didn't have this issue with the mini size, nor the first full size I went through - which lasted me almost exactly a month. It might be restricted to a particular batch, or it might just be luck of the draw. Either way I'm not taking my chances. Not a repurchase for me, at least not until the issue with the nozzle is taken care of.   ~ My Top 5 Beauty must-have list ~  1. Hair Loss Treatment: u2018Divine Herbalu2019 - Hair Oil  2.

PLEASE keep in mind this is a partial review, as i got this without getting a primer or a setting powder of any kind. i give this a 4/5 stars for two reasons.  1. it doesn't feel like extra weight on my face? the fine dispersion makes it feel like there's no extra layer. and if it got on my hair somehow, i didn't notice it feeling crunchy!  2. the mattifying effect, the most important part of this spray, was immediate in my use. even as i used a more dewy foundation (i use the tirtir mask fit red cushion not sold in sephora), the mattifying effect still held up! :)  again, this is only 4/5 because it gave me the effect i expected--BUT i'm not giving it a full chance since i don't have a primer and setting powder to give it a strong structure to build off of for staying power. will be writing an updated review once i have time with a primer and setting powder (both probably being one/size, but we'll see!)"

I could get past all of that if it actually did what it says it does and kept my makeup on and matte all day however my skin becomes shiny within a couple of hours and literally comes off as i dab.

Decided to give this a try and Iu2019m still in disbelief. It improves the look of my texture and it kept me matte for over 10 hours waiting in the airport after a 6 hour flight delay.

The first time I used this product, my makeup instantly became blotchy and my skin started showing through the makeup. It then became chalky and under my eyes became wet to the point my concealer was ruined. Long story short, I will never purchase this product again and I am extremely disappointed by this result. This was supposed to have been my Motheru2019s Day makeup look to spend the day out with my kids, but my makeup was ruined and I was so upset I ended up staying home."

I've been searching for a setting spray that LOCKS, SETS AND CONTROLS OILS for 6+ hours... and girl... THIS. IS. IT. I love the spray mist it gives me, you spray alot it doesn't wet your face, it sets and mattifies your skin instantly. I've done a wear test and it last all day for me which is about 7 or 8 hours. on the 7th hour maybe a small touch up but I haven't touched up my make-up all day and it was shockingly smooth, blurred and matte!! I event went to the gym in this, sweated, and it looked freaking amazing after!!   I'm a huge fan of this setting spray by Patrick Starr and I'm going to be getting more even though its pricey I say it's worth it.  I'm so happy yall!!!"

In terms of the performance, it does have a mattifying effect but also feels extremely drying. So if you have extremely oily skin and can look past the toxic smell. It might work. Just get a different setting spray tbh"

I'm the type to get super oily after about 2-3 hours of wearing makeup, especially in the T-zone. I work 10hr days in a fairly fast-paced environment where you have to wear a mask at all times. I decided to try out the On 'Til Dawn setting spray and I kid you not, my foundation did not budge. My makeup still looked fresh after 10hrs of wear, even under the mask. My only complaint is the nozzle is hard to work with and I do agree with other reviewers when they say you need a lot of product. So, you really have to press down as if you're working with a hair spray and try your best to not inhale it in the process."

It is fragranced though so if that bothers some people, you may want to skip this. I bought the mini but I'm definitely buying the bigger size during the upcoming sephora sale! I can't get over this, I LOVE IT!"
