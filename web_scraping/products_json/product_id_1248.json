My skin drinks up this product and I've just been using it for 6 days so far. A little goes a long way, and my skin has never been this glowy and refreshed! I still have acne scars but this product makes them less noticeable. I get occasional redness on my face, specifically my cheeks but since I started using this product I don't have redness right now. My skin has never felt and looked so good. I'm so happy :)"
