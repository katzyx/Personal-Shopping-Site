All these parts have a shared nerve supply and during sexual stimulation respond as a unit though the responses are not uniform..-The sense of touch is a complex sense that processes signals sent by different types of receptors in our body. Some are located more deeply under the skin react to vibration and pressure. Others pick up light touch.  ..Tips:.-Apply slowly on the vulva, from the clitoral glans to the vaginal entrance, or the other way around. .-Close your eyes and focus on the sensations on different part of the vulva: How does it feel around the vaginal entrance? How does it feel on the outer labia? .-After one orgasm reduce speed while pressing the Ballerina down on your vulva to ground yourself and maintain arousal for another round of pleasure. .-Put the Ballerina on your vulva and bring your thighs around it to hold itu2014enjoy it hands-free..-Use it during penetrative sex, moving it up away from the vaginal entrance towards the pubis, so that the clitoris glans and the labia around be stimulated.",

It was a bit different from what I expected based on the description, so I want to elaborate on that in hopes of being helpful for potential buyers.  I think I expected cushiony texture to mean this would have a good amount of give (think somewhat like a stress relief ball?) Instead, it is more firm (if you've ever used a ballpoint pen with those cushioned grippers on them, it very much feels like that!)  This is not to be interpreted as a negative, as I think the design is overall incredible, especially for those who are seeking to target exactly what this does. It does work well, and comes packaged with everything you need - including a nice storage bag.  Overall I would say this accomplishes it's intended goals!"

You can also use your hands though since it is made to fit perfectly in a hand.  It has so many settings so you can never get bored but my personal favorite is the surprise me mode.

Once I discovered how to position it deeper around my pubic bone, I experienced a whole new realm of delightful sensations. It's akin to the mutual satisfaction of holding a lover's hand. Initially, I had some reservations about the investment, but now I believe it will become a cherished item.
