			"review_text": "After getting pregnant and not being able to do a Brazilian blowout for months, my hair was in really bad shape. I tried every expensive product and every natural remedy (honey, aloe, apple cider vinegar...anything and everything)  to make it look nice and nothing worked. It was constantly dry so everyday was a ponytail. I had this is my cabinet for months and didn't like it when I initially tried it. I brought it out again as I was desperate and really followed the directions. Made sure to section hair in three parts (my hair is very thick) and saturate each section then blow dried like I usually did with a paddle brush and a round brush in spots. I used my airwrap once it was dry to add some movement. I don't think it lasts multiple washes because I've used it now at every wash which is fine with me. This is my third wash using it and it still works. Doesn't make my hair straight or anything like my brazillian blowout does but helps with the frizz and most importantly, the dryness. I still need to straighten my hair after drying because it is so poofy and curly but once straight, I can add curls with iron and some texture spray and it looks pretty sleek. 60-70% better than it did before so I will continue to purchase this and hopefully once I get a keratin treatment after pregnancy I won't need to use as much in the future. My advice is follow the directions and you will love it."

Tired of using ouai purology and all the rubbish so i decided to give a try to this product based upon some reviews! I washed my hair and put generously the serum from roots to ends! You’re gonna hate it! Then I started my brushing again I hated the way my hair felt! Dry and thick! Though I have extremely fine hair! I told myself my goodness what did I do! Well brushing done u put a very warm coat and went to an overcrowded mall ! Obviously I started sweating 🥵 as usual! lol so frustrating and big surprise! My hat Didn’t frizz but became slightly wavy 😂 impressed by the performance! Let’s see in summer when I’ll get back to Algeria within 53 degrees and sea salty weather and the beach 🏖️ and so on lol 😂"

First of all, the amount of product that you have to use vs price & quantity is terrible. To follow the directions, the smallest size will get you maybe two uses. For reference I have curly dry hair, normal density and a little longer than shoulder length hair. This product has an awful chemical smell and makes my hair look and feel like straw. I followed the instructions to a T, first blowing out with heat and following up with a flat iron. Not even generous amount of oil could gather the hay stack that had become my head. I had to stick my head under water and pray my curls would revert. There are so many quality heat protectants that implore you to not waste your time. I love the bumble and bumble primer, as it gives me silky blow outs and makes my hair feel protected. 0 stars for this product if I could."

It works best when blow drying and straightening to my knowledge as I have never used it before curling my hair. You apply it on wet/damp hair. It will make your hair crusty and sticky if applied on dry hair or is not treated with heat after application. I think it is intended as a heat protectant and I have used it as so when blow drying my natural curls. It helps with frizz but nothing special if thats what you're looking for. Hope this helps people! I have repurchased this product because it helps with frizz, shine, and sleekness but I would love to find a good dupe that is also cruelty free :)"

If we don't follow those instructions, we might as well not use it.  That said, when applied properly, hair looks very healthy, shines and tangles less.

That doesn’t usually happen with me so I know it’s from this product. I talked with my stylist and she said use less product or put it on your hands and lightly do the top section of my head. That seemed to work a little better but because this protectant is oil based, there’s not much you can do about that. A huge tip that I learned though is make sure your hair is about 70% wet still or get your hair wet before using your blow brush or blow dryer."

I've tried everything under the sun, starting in 2006 and continuing until this last year, when I decided to try this stuff. I've found my stupid Holy Grail. Dreamcoat is incredible; it makes my hair shiny, maintains the style/sheen even after sleeping on it for two+ days, and the application lasts 2ish washes before needing to reapply. However, there's a few catches. 1. You need to use an ABSURD amount of product to get the desired results. Think you've sprayed enough??? Think again, and spray some more. It's an expensive item which makes using it so heavily a bit painful. 2. You need follow the directions perfectly, meaning Dream Coat must be sprayed onto your wet hair in small sections, fully brushed through, then resection the hair to blow dry it.* 3. *You must be skilled enough with a blow-dryer and round brush to blow out your hair properly. Maintaining tension, heat, and going through the sections quickly enough so your hair doesn't air-dry is important. Without Dream Coat, I can still dry my hair into this style, it just won't stay if a raincloud is within 300 miles of my location.  I like my hair to look ruffled, but I've included an image of my hair before the ruffling."

I wouldn't say my hair is particularly shiney or frizz-free, but it's not worse. The frizz I tend to get on top is maybe a TINY bit less, but not by much and not enough to now go ahead and buy the large size when I run out of the mini. I did all the steps and even flat ironed it after to try to get some extra heat activation as is recommended by some people online, but it's just meh. It doesn't have a nice smell to it (luckily it is not very strong) and it is really just mid. A little disappointed but will continue to use it since I bought it. I could go return it but idek if it's worth the time lol. I did see some reviews saying it takes a couple of applications to really see the difference, so hopefully that will happen for me too.

			"review_text": "I really really wanted to like this, but alas. I have 4C hair and while I would like to wear my hair straightened sometimes I’ve totally given up because I’m sick and tired of spending hours doing the whole shebang (blow drying, straightening, etc.) and my hair proofing back up LITERALLY MINUTES LATER. Granted, some of it could be where I live and the season (New York, with humid summers) but despite even waiting for cooler, dryer months the issue remains pretty much the same. I’ve been all over YouTube, and I’ve learned a bunch of helpful tricks: - clarifying your hair before a silk press - Apple cider vinegar rinse to completely close cuticles - do silk presses on completely clean hair (as in NO leave ins) - making sure your hair is COMPLETELY DRY before beginning flat ironing  …which I’m sure are helpful to an extent, but I also saw this product being hailed as the holy grail by 3/4 curl type influencers so I thought I’d give it a try.   In short, I’ve tried this product twice to no avail. It just doesn’t work. I was told to try the Extra Strength version of this by similar influencers which I sought out with enthusiasm and hope in my eyes (🤩 <- my naive eyes), with literally the same result: no results.   It might work for people with looser curls (maybe anyone under 3C) but certainly not my 4C tight, coily curls. 😭   Some things of note: - This product weirdly has no smell. When I first used it, I thought maybe I had been scammed and they just sent me water. Nope, it’s the real deal, it just has a super light smell (very, VERY light chemical smell on further inspection).  - It can get a little sticky with buildup (but I did use A LOT, so maybe that’s just me), with the Extra Strength version being a bit stickier.   Good luck if you do end up trying this! Hope it works out. As for me, I’m still on the hunt for my magical 100% humidity-proof product. If it’s not out there yet, I’m sure they’ll crack the code one day. 😢"

My hair gets a bit frizzy, but what I was really going after was this glass like shine that was advertised. Let me tell you, there's some serious photoshopping going on because my hair became dull after using it. The first time I used it I didn't see any change, but it did hold my hair in place a little bit better. I could have used my $5 hairspray to achieve the same result. Only it would have held better. The second time I used it I figured maybe it didn't work as well because I didn't saturate my hair quite as dramatic as I was supposed to. So this time I used a lot. Like I said, I have long hair, all the way down to the bottom of my back, so I used almost half the bottle by this point. After drying/styling my hair, there was still no shine and my hair ended up having the same frizz and now was difficult to get my fingers through. I couldn't even brush my hair that night because it was so full of product. They say this stays in your hair for a few washes and that is definitely true. I couldn't brush my hair properly, without tangled, for over a week. if you want to hold your hair down just use hairspray. This is an expensive product and it does not give the shine as promised. They show a bunch of very young women who have beautiful hair. They always show it in the most frizzed out crazy way that no one's hair actually looks like. And then after they brushed and styled it, it looks gorgeous. Is that not how life is? I'm going to give this product one more chance and then I will either raise my review or lower it down to one star. But there's no chance this will ever get five stars. Like I said, there's no shine. That is literally camera tricks to fool us consumers."

I sprayed it in sections and used my chi brush dryer to dry my hair.... then lightly used a flat iron as usual... I can't live without this now. This is the only pre-product I use. I use a lit sale and sea texture after I style and light hairspray, but I get so much shine and my hair lasts for days. My hair also feels like silk.  Truly impressed. I purchased the small bottle twice, but I go through it too quickly,  so I'm upgrading. Anyone having issues.  You need to use enough. Section your hair & follow the directions (it is heat activated). 😉"

The trick is to spray it generously from multiple angles to coat all the hair, then brush through, then blow dry. The anti-frizz properties do last more than one wash, and even help keep the frizz down when I wear my hair curly, too. I also have the dream coat curly version and it works well."

It is just not efficient to use your own hair. I can see it being user-friendly to use on a client but to use on yourself, not my favorite aside from that I like the product, and did see nice results. You want to apply product to wet hair and style using some tension which can be a little annoying because you have to have a set amount of time to style appropriately for the product to work to its full potential however what I do like is the long lasting results that you see with this product. You only have to use it every 3-4 washes which is nice."

The lightweight formula doesn't weigh my hair down or leave it feeling greasy, which is a huge plus."

			"review_text": "Hair:  Very long, touch, natural curl, color treated with developing grays and prone to frizz  To begin with,  understand my routine, I believe in a good shampoo and conditioner,  wash 1-2 times a week,  an occasional deep conditioner,  stylist visit every 10-12 weeks.  Blow drying my hair is a process. Some people say they have natural curl, I have natural frizz,  especially if I blow dry. I believe less is more,  especially since I highlight my hair. I have a goddess of a stylist, who will spend half an hour to 45 minutes strategically blow drying my hair every visit to leave it looking straight and shiny.    Now that we have the background out of the way,  let's get down to business.   I was seriously contemplating a Brazilian Blowout or Keratin treatments to tame my hair when my stylist dropped this Color Wow Dream Coat in my hand.  Nope,  she wasn't trying to make a sale,  they don't carry it in the salon,  it's her personal product to use with her clientele,  and she is obsessed with it.  The first time she used it I wasn't sure, it was hard to tell the difference since she's a Rockstar with the blow dryer.  However,  three days later when my hair was still shiny,  straight,  frizz free,  and with no knots,  I was amazed.   I started searching online...  The reviews for Dreamcoat are mixed across numerous retailers,  so I was skeptical, but knowing my stylist swears by it,  I looked at it very closely and decided to give it a try.   I read the directions online for how to apply and use it, and began to understand the mixed reviews.  The key is in the HEAT and TENSION on freshly shampooed,  towel dried hair! This product is not intended for dry hair at all, but it's not intended for soaking wet hair either. I use a blow out brush (Drybar's Double Shot) and Dreamcoat and my prayers have been answered!  Follow the directions, heat and tension,  and you'll have the hair you've always dreamed in between those salon visits."

It would also be less manageable for updos (think, pony tails/braids).   This treatment I tried on a whim and I’m so glad I did!

I recently purchased the mini bottle of this whilst on vacation last year for me to try. My biggest concern when styling my hair is lack of shine, frizz control and the style actually holding more than 5 minutes. I must say I gave in to the hype on the various platforms but this product is sadly not the least bit effective. I was not expecting super model hair ofc but I was hoping for a little more than what I received ( which was absolutely NOTHING!!). Another thing is the smell is not the greatest and is rather hair spray like. Whilst it did not make my hair any worse, it did not make a bit of difference after attempting to “style”. I am of the firm belief that this is targeted to hair that’s pretty much already somewhat healthy and manageable but require a little glam up. It is not for my hair in the Caribbean climate that I live. Also, for the price point I will not purchase the bigger size nor recommend."

One drop of humidity and it was over. The directions say to use it after shampoo and conditioner and that's how I was using it. Then I decided to try it without conditioner and it worked beautifully! My hair was shiny, smooth, and frizz-free for days. I received a lot of compliments (and questions lol).The next time, I tried it with Fekkai clarifying shampoo and my hair was still looking great on wash day a week later. This spray does not play well with other products. It works best when my hair is completely clean and I use no other styling products. I rub on a few drops of hair oil when I've finished blow drying and flat ironing, but that's it. For reference, my hair is super coily, color-treated, and not relaxed. I use a Conair dryer and a Croc flat iron, both on high heat. I haven't noticed any heat damage so far. Four stars because it doesn't last through 3 shampoos for me. But it does last through one shampoo. The photo was taken the next day after washing and styling. I had used Dream Coat the previous wash day a week earlier. I love it."

This stuff is a major game changer and never will another product ever touch my hair. It is IMPERATIVE that you follow directions exactly otherwise it won't work. Being able to chat or discussions on the Sephora platform is where this is important. I bought the mini and I almost used the whole bottle, but I have thick shoulder length hair. It has a strange texture when applying, must be generously applied by sections after towel drying. DO NOT hold back, the purpose is to have each strand of hair coated, brush through hair gently and simply blow dry. It's like just stepping out of the salon it looks and feels so beautiful! My blonde locks are silky shiny and light as air...I couldn't believe what I was seeing and feeling. No need to think, every woman should have this product and I will be replacing my hair products with other ColorWow ASAP!"

I watched so many videos with tips so I felt like I knew how to use it by the time I got it. I have naturally curly hair that gets even more curly and frizzy in humid weather. I also live in hot humid South Florida where you feel like you are in a constant sauna. In fact, it’s usually pointless for me to even dry and straighten my hair because as soon as I step outside the frizz begins and if it rains forget about it. But let me tell you this stuff works! It is magical. The key is to use way more than you think. You really have to make sure every part of your hair is coated. And then this is activated by heat. And I feel like it needs more than just the heat of a blow dryer. It also needs a styling tool to set it. And when I do those steps my hair is perfect and smooth. No frizz. And it lasts, through humidity, through rain. My hair still looks perfect like I got a blowout. After I use this product, the next time I wash my hair I use a clarifying shampoo and a hydrating conditioner and my curls are still perfect. So this product doesn’t weigh them down or damage them. I’m so impressed I’ve already repurchased."

The first time I used it, my hair was straight & curved under on the ends - just the way I wanted it. AND ... it stayed straight even when it was drizzling rain outside - a minor miracle!! My search is over - this is the stuff for me from here on out! Keep in mind, though, that it's heat activated. However, I was in a rush the other morning & didn't dry it - just put a scrunchie in it & went. Of course, it was wavy, but definitely not frizzy!! Yay!!!

I've definitely come across amazing ones, and read the reviews snd thought, let me give WOW Dream Coat a shot. I wasn't impressed.  It didn't do anything to my hair that a regular blowout couldn't do. I've used less expensive products tjst worked far better.  Not worth the money,  imo. I spend a lot on hair tools and products and know how to use them. This might be good for fine or already straight or wavy hair, but I seriously don't even feel anything when i spray it on my hand, so thats probably why theres no  'sheen' when applied.  I tested it in all kinds if environments too. Did fine in dry, sunny, low humidity days. Not great during dsys of higher humidity.  Keep in mind when doing a good blowout,  you don't really need product unless you want that ultra shine, in which case this didn't do it. I wanted long term temporary frizz free hair on humid days. This is not the product I'd choose. Wouldn't recommend."

Just be sure to apply heat and tension (I use the Revlon One-Step Volumizer hair dryer) to activate the product. I apply it every 3rd shampoo (using a clarifying shampoo). The manufacturer recommends that no other styling products are applied when applying Dream Coat (when it's wet) so I don't use my regular styling products with it but I find that I actually don't need them. On the first and second shampoo afterwards, I return to using my usual styling products. After the third shampoo, I use Dream Coat again by itself. According to the ingredient list, it doesn't have any added fragrance (I'm not a fan of fragrance in beauty products) but it does have a very slight scent from its ingredients; I can't smell the scent at all after my hair is dried. I can tell that the product is truly sealing moisture into my hair because when I dry my hair after applying Dream Coat, I don't see the usual steam rising. I'm glad that Sephora sells this in the 500mL size!"

My normal, Hair Stylist is moving away to Georgia and I wanted to work on doing my own blowouts at home, especially with my type of hair, which is mixed African-American! I stumbled upon this product online and watched a few videos and made sure to study the instructions of making sure your hair is damp and not overly soaked, spraying by section, which I actually sprayed all over instead of bisection top to bottom and I even bought the hair mask that was recommended by this brand as well. At first it felt like I was spraying water on my hair and didn’t have much of a scent, same thing with the hair mask and I was a little worried my hair wasn’t going to be nice and hydrated. However, by the time I blow dry my hair and sectioned everything my hair blowout very nice and smooth. Then I went ahead and flat ironed my hair thoroughly section by section and my hair was very silky, felt nice in sleek, was not feeling weighed down with any product and was very bouncy! I’m definitely going to be buying this again including the hair mask. Pro tip. If you have curly thick hair and or are African-American, please make sure to apply it when the hair is damp and apply a lot of tension to the hair with your blow dryer and comb through it and make sure you have a good heat on your flat iron."

But the really impressive effects of this product was the humidity control. I moved to Seattle a few years ago and have been battling with frizz and unruly waves ever since. This product helped my hair stay smoothed for DAYS! Not only in humidity - but rain as well!! The results were SHOCKING! After a few uses I’m absolutely hooked. I’ve found it works best if I am incredibly generous with the application (don’t worry, it doesn’t weight down your hair or leave residue! Another big plus) and use tension like a blow dry brush to style. Honestly a game changer."

I like the feel of fresh clean hair after a wash not the feeling of heaviness from old product. I really try to reduce build up and deliberately putting on something that doesn’t wash out is a little cringey. It really didn’t do much my hair overall, it probably reduced frizz a bit but made it look a little weighed down in return, I ended up having to wash my hair sooner then my norm. I have other products I like to use so the fact it says to only use their product alone is kind of a red flag for a marketing ploy. I also prefer a cream blow dry protectant. Will not repurchase, glad I only got a small bottle. I find I get the same amount of frizz reduction by simply finishing off my style with a hair oil. Might work better for curly or corse hair, I think it was a bit to heavy for my fine strands. If your goal is long term hair health then this isn’t best product, there’s nothing nourishing, it your just looking for something for a quick frizz fix then it might work for you."

I try to leave it curly one wash and straighten the other wash. Using this, I wash my hair as normal, apply other products out of the shower, air dry for up to two hours and then when I’m ready to use the AirWrap, I section out my hair and spray this all over each small section and blow dry smooth. No frizz, it’s like magic I swear. I was amazed when using it the first time and I don’t think I could live without this. next I’ll try the curly hair version of this"

I use it with my hair oil and other heat protectant, and it's best to use this as the last product in my opinion. My hair felt much silkier even after a couple of washes. It feels like I just got fresh toner and leave my hair with that same smooth hydrated feel. I also love that this product isn't heavy on the hair! I can coat my hair thoroughly with the spray, and it's not heavy at all, it really doesn't leave a residue which I was initially concerned about. My hair is fine and dense, and mostly straight. For my hair type, I really love this product and would definitely recommend."

Usually when I blow dry and straighten it, my hair is dry, frizzy, and doesn't take long to curl up, especially at the roots. I decided that with all the great reviews for this product, that I would give it a try. Attempt 1: I used the product as directed. Towel dried hair, sprayed liberally and blow dry with tension to activate. I even watched a video of the creator using it on curly hair! After blow drying using my revlon roll brush, my hair was POOFY and frizzy HOWEVER it felt very soft which I loved. I then straighened it and had to add some hair oil at the ends. My hair was okay but def curled up at the roots especially at the gym and my hair was not frizz free. I had to keep restraightening it or blowdrying it because my ends and sometimes roots were curling up. I also kept using a hair oil to keep it sleek and frizz free which helped a lot. Attempt 2: I gave the product a second try. This time I tried using a roll brush and blow dryer first but there was not enough tension. So I went back to the revlon roll brush at a higher heat setting and my hair was looking nicer when blow dried and feeling very soft like before. I then tried straightening it and again it wouldn't really straighten and curled up. THEN, I went outside ( it has been raining all day and night). My hair was covered and mind you I just straightened it again. When I arrived to my destination it was FRIZZY and curled up already! Overall, I think this product is good for some hair types but NOT ALL hair types. I love how soft my hair was but for the amount of hype this product is getting, it isn't worth it. I even tried the water drop test and it soaked through my hair (again followed the directions correctly). So sad this didn't work for my hair:(. On to the next search for a product."

But, turns out with the right product, I am ACTUALLY getting a salon quality blowout. My hair is smooth, silky, under control, fresh, and bouncy. ColorWow is ridiculously good - if it doesn’t work for you, use more or use it on damp hair.. it’s all about the technique, the actual product will deliver if used right. In awe of how great it is.

Unless the formula in the large size is different from what was in the deluxe samples available by promo code a few months ago, I can’t possibly understand the negative reviews. I have waist-length, coarse/damaged, dyed hair with lots of breakage and only need 4 sprays of this stuff on towel-dried hair (I divide my hair in half and use 2 sprays per side). I distribute it evenly through with a comb then blowdry while pulling hair taut as per instructions. I get holy-grail-level softness/anti-frizziness/manageability that greatly reduces the time it takes to flatiron my hair, and lasts even after another wash or two, and somehow avoids making my roots greasy. I live on the Gulf Coast where we have 100% humidity almost every day and this stuff is incredible. I think it’s probably best for damaged, fine Caucasian hair, especially long hair and people who flatiron after blowdrying. The small bottle lasts forever, too"

I blow dried it anyway to see the results and my hair was still frizzy (granted not as frizzy but for the price it better work as advertised), I had to straighten it and even then the frizz was noticeable. Returned it, not worth the money if it doesn't work."

No matter the shampoo/conditioner you use, you can spray this throughout your damp hair and it perfects every strand. I have thin fine hair that is usually very frizzy by nature.  But when I use this, my hair becomes silky, shiny, smooth and beyond 100% frizz free. Like a magazine ad almost seriously.   I only gave it four stars though because you do have to dry your hair with tension when you use this. Some Colorwow products are like that, you have to either dry with heat or use tension or both, so keep that in mind as to not waste product.  But also, like this one, some Colorwow products are supposed to last 3 shampoos so you are definitely getting your money's worth."

			"review_text": "I have been using this product for 1.5 months now with 2 hair wash days a week. For reference, I have thin (hair density), medium-fine (hair thickness), medium porosity (hair moisture absorption/retention). It is considered long, layered, and recently dyed dark black; however, natural hair is already closer to brown black (just had bad balayage from 2 years ago that fades bottom). I use the revlon brush once a week and sometimes followed by hot tools. Prior to Dreamcoat, I was trying out multi-tasking leave ins for years like Pureology Colour Fanatic, Redken One United (top 2), It’s a 10, Ouai, Olapex 6&7, Eva NYC mane magic, and Shea moisture’s styler (top 2). My usual routine before my revlon brush would be shampoo 2x (sometimes Olapex 3 in between washes), apple cider vinegar rinse, hair mask in shower (alternating between hydration, protein, combos-based), leave-in conditioner, then Paul Mitchell’s skinny serum. I had pretty silky hair, mostly free from split ends too. I tried dreamcoat on its own after the shower then blow dried and my hair looked shiny and bouncy. Nothing different than my usual results though, other than one-less product used. But dreamcoat couldn’t compete with San Francisco’s humidity. After one shift at work (indoors, but public-transportation commute) my hair was frizzy at the roots! I was able to brush it smooth again that night and apply argan oil to my ends which made my hair look nice the next morning. However, it kept getting frizzy on the days leading to my next wash so I was applying more products closer to my roots. The buildup was getting me oily faster. I think my hair needed more moisture which I would get with the multitasking leave-in then sealed and shined with skinny serum. I also learned after 2 weeks, my hair needed more heat protectant because ends were dry and splitting. So basically, I ended up using dreamcoat 2x a week w/ heat protectant. 2 products again post-shower, but the other combos last longer w/out dryness."

I would recommend starting with less than you think you need and adding more as necessary. I find that I don't need to completely saturate my entire head like the instructions suggest to get it to work. I have to imagine that oversaturating your hair with this will end up weighing your hair down in the end. I do a top and bottom section and spray a few sprays for each layer and that does the trick. Just make sure you brush it through your hair first and give it a moment before applying heat."

Bc of its color & porosity, it is already very shiny. However, I do struggle with frizz, especially after blow drying. I was recommended this product by my stylist and was very excited to try it out based on the claims.  Now, because of how my hair is, I know that no matter what it says on the bottle, I will need at least twice that amount of product. I read the reviews before buying this and knew it wouldn’t last me long. One use is about 1/4 of the full size bottle for me, at minimum. I would’ve been okay with that if it worked well, but that hasn’t been my experience.  I’ve tried it twice: the first time, it did nothing, but I think it was user error — I don’t think I used enough product and I also don’t think I blow dried w/ enough tension.   The second time, I used a TON of product and took a lot of time to make sure I blow dried well. It did.. a little? Right after blow drying, it was as frizzy as ever. After brushing and letting my hair cool, there was some improvement. I ended up straightening it with a bit of argan oil on the ends of my hair.   The results I got:  - less frizzy (still gets frizzy easily, but I can tame it with finger combing even when out and about) - silky/ gets less tangled  - my straightening lasted much longer than usual   Results I didn’t get: - glass hair (my hair is no shinier than usual, though it’s always pretty shiny) - lasting through shampoos - no frizz (definitely still get it, just maybe 50% less and easier to tame)  I believe the hype, I honestly think it just doesn’t work as well on my hair (and with my skill level — I wouldn’t be surprised if a professional could get it to work). Based on the results I got, I’m more likely to try another product for this issue instead of repurchasing. I just don’t think it’s worth the price for the results I got & how much I had to use !"

I followed the instructions he gave (make sure hair is super saturated with the product) and yes this product definitely gives you that smooth flowing look- even at the ends where my blonde really struggles!  I'm giving 4 star because it isn't quite as advertised. I noticed my hair would be damaged if I used this too often and there was definitely still a bit of frizz at the top- but all and all it's the best blow-dry product I've tried yet.   I'd recommend using only for special occasions!  Don't forget the product activates under tension so you really do need to use a round brush when drying."

My hair is shiny, sleek, and literally feels like silk. Suuuper worth it.   My only tip is to make sure not to get much on your roots. I usually wash my hair just once a week but after using this once I've had to wash my hair 3 times this week because it looks greasy after a couple days. Just put it in your mids/ends and comb it through them without getting the product on your scalp/roots.   Seriously though buy this its amazing"

I bought the mini version to try out, I was skeptical but used it for the first time following the directions and I’m obsessed!! After shampoo/conditioning on towel dried hair, I soaked my hair with it (I have thick, wavy hair), brushed it through and used maybe half of the mini bottle. I will say it feels a little weird putting that much product in after a wash but I was determined to follow exact instructions to see if she was right. I blow dried my hair using tension (using my hands - lightly grasping and pulling) and it is so soft, shiny, silky and so so easy to style!! Could get away with not running a flat iron through my hair because it wasn’t frizzy after blow drying at all. Feels healthy like I used a treatment mask. I wash every every other day and the product kept my hair well styled and not frizzy in humid Minnesota 100 degree heat. Will purchase the full size and think it is at a fair price point."

I wanted a product that was: light weight and would: add shine, reduce frizz/protect from humidity, make my hair silky soft My hair looked the same as always. The only thing I'll say is that it didn't get AS frizzy as it normally would when I went outside.  I guess I expected too much. I personally don't think it's worth the 28$ I spent. Save your money- try Amikas primer."

I was expecting not that much frizz in my hair but it was still there but my hair did last longer and in good condition after straightening it.  I'm not sure if I am using it right because people say to drench your hair but I will try it again definitely!"

I  comb it through and I   blow dry the roots to get the volume then used my Revlon  blow dryer to blow dry straight small  sections  at a time. My hair fells silky. didn't  use and other product besides these just to make sure  it worked."

I followed the instructions, and while I did see some of the water rolling off the hair effect right after blow drying, my hair ended up heavy and super frizzy, way worst than my minimally frizzy natural hair. I’d highly recommend you DON’T buy this, unless you like throwing money away and/or hate your hair."

I went for 2 hour walk after using it while the humidity was at 90% and it looked the exact same as it did when I left the house! I’ll definitely be purchasing the full size!!"
