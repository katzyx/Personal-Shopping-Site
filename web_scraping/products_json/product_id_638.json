Unlike most lip glosses that tend to be sheer, this one delivers a highly pigmented, bold finish that really stands out. Whether you're going for a subtle pop of color or layering it for a more dramatic look, this gloss does not disappoint.  The texture is another major winu2014itu2019s smooth and creamy without any of that sticky, tacky feeling that some glosses have. It glides on effortlessly, leaving your lips looking full and shiny without feeling heavy or uncomfortable. The staying power is also impressive; it lasts for hours without needing constant reapplication, which is a huge plus.  The scent is a lovely bonusu2014it has a pleasant fragrance that isnu2019t overpowering, just a nice touch that makes the application even more enjoyable. Overall, this lip gloss is a perfect blend of color, comfort, and staying power. If youu2019re looking for a high-quality lip gloss that offers more than just shine, this one is definitely worth trying."

I tend to prefer non-sticky gloss that is long wearing and a nice shine to it , I found that this GXVE bubble pop electric lipgloss in the shade u2018all my love- warm berryu2019 is absolutely perfect! I love the shade on my warm olive tone skin, it is cruelty-free, vegan and made the clean list at Sephora so I feel safer putting it on my lips. The formula is creamy and gives a good amount of pigment and color. I like how it adds dimension to the lips giving an illusion of a fuller pout. I tested it out for a day to see if it would be removed throughout the day and truly, it stayed put all I had to do was reapply after eating of course. Not to mention, Gwenu2019s makeup has such cute packaging and sets itself apart giving it an edgy yet clean look. Canu2019t wait to try other colors!"

I was able to try the shade All My Love, which is a beautiful mauvey berry And I can honestly say this is one of my favorite lip gloss formulas.  It is definitely a more opaque formula so keep that in mind. It is very glossy very pigmented perfect to wear on its own, with a lip liner, or an over a lip stain would also be beautiful. I love that it does not feel sticky on your lips and kind of just dries down but keeps that shine for long wearing juiciness.  The applicator is very nice as well. It perfectly contours your lips so with one swipe youu2019re done!  The packaging is also gorgeous. If you are familiar with GXVE packaging, they have that very distinct aesthetic, which I absolutely love.  It is also important to me to find products that are clean, cruelty free, and vegan, so this was a nice plus."

I felt the candy sweet smell, as many lip glosses have. But I like this smell. The color is the best match for me, I use it as a single product and as an addition to some of my matte lipsticks. When I apply it by itu2019s own, the lip gross makes my lips look glossy, but not too much. I also feel some hydration. It covers my lips without making even tiny wrinkles visible. Thatu2019s why I also add it to other matte lipsticks, which have this problem. Only one thing made me a little sad. If to apply as a single product, it doesnu2019t last long, I need to renew it every hour or about that. Yes, I still feel it on my lips, but it becomes more invisible and I want it to be with me a little longer."

Itu2019s rare for a lip gloss scent to grab my attention, but this scent is SO GOOD. I find myself grabbing it just for a boost of dopamine that the scent enhances. Itu2019s love that itu2019s thick enough to last and youu2019ll rarely have to retouch, but itu2019s not so thick that it moves your lipstick or gets on your makeup around your mouth. I love the color they all my love gives, itu2019s a deeper watermelon color, but itu2019s not nearly as dark as it looks in the packaging. I donu2019t think you could go wrong with any shade. This is an incredible lip product and Iu2019m so glad I was gifted it!"

So I was super excited to try this GXVE bubble pop electric lip gloss. The all my love color is a little bit darker than I would usually go for. But the color is still pretty. I love the fact that it is not too sticky on my lips after applying. However, I wish the lip application can be a little bit bigger so it might be easier for me to apply. I usually do one or two swaps with the lip gloss but with this one, I have to go over few swaps to reach the coverage and the look I want. I am a mom of two young boys, so I like to do quick makeup before heading out, I would prefer this lip gloss can be a little easier for me to apply. Or probably I should just go for a lighter color."

Its both gentle on the lips and delivers real hydration.   u2018All My Loveu2019 boasts a gorgeous red/berry/burgundy shade with a glass-like shine. Its the perfect marriage of color and gloss, great everyday wear. The texture is smooth, luxurious, and not too sticky or tacky - super easy application. It gives the best wet, dewy finish I have yet to find in a lip gloss or liquid lipstick. The only thing I might add is that the gloss does transfesr (as gloss commonly does) so be careful around clothing. Other than that, I have nothing but wonderful things to say.

I don't really have any lips so I take all the help I can get. This had just a touch of color to it which makes it look natural on my mouth. With a really good glossy shine to make my lips feel juicy. I can't say that I am crazy about the smell. That's probably the only reason I didn't give this gloss five stars, but it isn't horrible. I have products that smell much worse. It just smells like coffee to me or like a frappuccino. I'm not a big coffee person, so it would probably smell better if you were a coffee lover.  It doesn't have a taste at all which I thought was nice and once you apply this, it lasts for quite a while. I absolutely adore the packaging. It just makes me feel bougie holding it. It is so pretty. The wand is good and overall I do like this a lot. I would love to see it come in different flavors though."

A shiney lip just finishes the whole look and looks fresh and can be casual and intriguing whether the occasion is every day or black tie. Gxve Bubble Pop is unique with spherical powder throughout to help it melt into the lips and give a long lasting pop of fresh.  I tried the gloss alone on exfoliated and prepped lips, using the applicator included in the tube. I was really surprised when I first touched it to my lips because the applicator is cushion like, soft and has some bounce, giving it a unique feel. I was worried that the color would be too warm but found it adjusted to my skin tone and looks flattering.  The texture is soft and slippery without being greasy and glides on like a charm.  What I love the most is that. I was worried that it might feather or bleed but there was no sign of that. Not a bit of stickiness and my lips felt wonderful after wearing it all day.  Whether you wear alone or on top of lipstick Bubble Pop is worth a try and the price wonu2019t break the bank."

The smell is amazing. I love the vanilla scent it has. I love it. I could sit and sniff it all day. If you like sweet scents, then youu2019re gonna love this. I actually threw out my old gloss and replaced it with this one. If you like long-lasting lip-gloss and gourmand scents, then this is the product for you."

I rarely wear anything matte especially liquid lipsticks. With that and as beauty professional Iu2019ve tried many glosses over the years!  This one by Gxve is quite good.  I tried the All of Me color which is described as a u201cwarm berryu201d. The packaging is very cute.  The texture is thinner, not too sticky but has enough body to gxve a lot of color and moisture!  The formula is vegan and gluten free and contains spherical powders that make for the even coverage of the color shine.  The applicator is a doe foot which also adds to the even application.  The scent to lightly vanilla (NOT bubble gum despite the name).   I definitely would like to try my colors from this fab formula!"

It has a really pretty color and I think it looks really good on me. The shade may appear dark, but once I applied it, it wasn't as dark on my lips but it is buildable and could go well with lipstick as well. It is also a shade I feel would go well with various skin tones. I also like the amount of shine it has to it as well as the scent of the lip gloss. To me, the scent is sweet like vanilla frosting, and it reminds me a lot of my childhood and teenage years and the glosses I used to back then. Now I didn't find it all that sticky but there is a slight stickiness to it, but for the most part, I felt my lips were pretty smooth when I rubbed them together with just a slight tackiness to them but not enough to bother me. As for how long it lasts, it does last a while but not all day and would need applying especially if you're eating or drinking but overall, I was fairly satisfied with how long it lasted.  *This review was collected as part of a promotion*"

I can be pretty picky with my lipglosses and dont like ones that are overly sticky, this one is just on the border of stickiness but its more tolerable and doesnt stick to every piece of hair that flies in my face. Everything else about it is amazing though! It has great color payoff which I was expecting due to Gwens signature lip, and the scent is really nice! To me it smells like a warm vanilla cookie. I do have to reapply a fee times throughout the day, but this is typically for a lipgloss and i would say it keeps my lips fairly hydrated. I will definitely be wanting to buy more colors in the future."

Unfortunately the formula was just a little too thick for my liking. Itu2019s not bad by any means, itu2019s just okay. It goes on really thick and is sticky on the lips, which is why I give it 3 stars. The color payoff is pretty good and I think this shade would be great with a darker lip liner to really accentuate the lips, or with a plumper underneath. Other than that, it did make my lips feel soft and hydrated and once I had let it sit for a little bit it was a little more comfortable on the lips, but the formula was still really thick which was the biggest downside."

Even though they donu2019t last long I would rather reapply between clients than be half smudged. This lip gloss acts like lipstick in the way that it doesnu2019t run. Most glosses seem to run around the lip line where these stays put. I am not too thrilled with the smell. It smells like vanilla and reminds me of being a pre-teen in the mid 90u2019s. I felt the formula to be gummy as well. I know that is normal for a gloss and I know that is probably why it stays put but it feels heavy on my lips. The good thing is that it removes easily.

Itu2019s my favorite kind of lip-gloss formula. One that has less slip and more grip, one that is kinda sticky and isnu2019t lightweight, one that is hydrating and nourishing, and one that provides high shine. The wand is completely flat and easy to work with, but doesnu2019t pick up much product (fine for my thinner lips).  I have it in the shade u201cAll My Loveu201d and itu2019s described as a warm berry that will suit many skin tones. It is pigmented with only one pass, but can be built up even more.  My favorite quality about this creamy formula is how I can still use it when I have dry cracked lips because of how hydrating it feels and how it doesnu2019t emphasize the dryness or sink into lip lines. Its easy to apply and while it is pigmented, lipliner isnu2019t a necessity. And I also like how it leaves behind an even stain and lip balm feel behind when the glossiness has worn off. Only thing I do not like about this lip gloss is the scent. It smells like that generic vanilla scent in the tube, but it isnu2019t noticeable when on the lips. Highly recommend the shade u201cAll My Loveu201d and this formula if you like pigmented thicker glosses."

The formula is non-sticky and feels comfortable, going on smoothly for a long-lasting finish without feeling super tacky. The color is just right for day or night.

It's definitely a go-to in my beauty routine now, adding just the right amount of glam to my look.

The color All My Love is absolutely gorgeous. The gloss itself is decently opaque that provides a gorgeous color on the lips and a great glossy finish. The only thing I took one star off for was how sticky this gloss is. The gloss is decently thick which makes it pretty sticky on the lips. Very typical for a lot of glosses, but that ends up being the factor that makes me not reach for these types of glosses the most. Overall, very pretty color and worth a try!"

It feels high quality and has more of that classic doe foot style applicator vs the oversized ones we've been seeing a lot with new launches. The scent is pleasant and not so strong that it's noticeable beyond application. The formula feels kind of dated, to be completely honest. It is more of a thicker sticky gloss that reminds me of the types of lip glosses that released a decade ago. That said, if you're used to this kind of texture, it's a nice product. This shade is not nearly as deep berry as it appears in the tube; it sheers out evenly and wears a pretty long time. Overall, I like it but it's not going to be a holy grail product in my collection."

If you used a complimentary liner it would add additional lasting power and make the lips appear fuller with its mirror-like shine. Appreciate its a vegan product especially since we ultimately ingest lip products. Five shades of pretty colors, All My Love, a saturated berry shade, I will love wearing it into the autumnal months.

The pigment is really nice, and you could build it up to make it even more pigmented. Unfortunately, the color is pretty much the only thing I really enjoyed about this lip gloss. This lip gloss is very, very sticky, which I didn't like, and it doesn't feel like it moisturized my lips at all. It is also very heavily scented, like super sweet artificial vanilla, and not in a good way. When I first smelled it without putting it on my lips, I thought it was fine, but after wearing it for a few hours, I wanted to take it off. I personally wouldn't recommend this lip gloss due to the fact that the only thing I enjoyed about it was the color."

That will give a glossy effect to your favorite lipstick. Gxve in shade All My Love-warm berry lip gloss itself has really pretty color which makes it so versatile can be worn alone or on top of lipsticks. Best thing is its cruelty free & free from all nasty ingredients. Can be worn on daily basis hence i consider it keeping in my bag all the time for that glossy look whenever needed.

It smells delicious and is one of the things I enjoyed when putting it on. It smells like chocolate or like a cake to me. Whatever that scent is, make that a perfume or a candle. The gloss is a bit too sticky and I don't think it has long staying power on its own but it does make my lips look cute and soft. Definitely not for someone who isn't into lip gloss. The packaging is super cute and makes an impact without being too flashy. I like the attention to detail on the inside of the box too with the red bandana print. Overall, the gloss is easy to apply and can be layered for more drama or just quickly applied to give yourself a little pop. This review was collected as part of a promotion."

All My Love is a high shine gloss in a warm berry shade. It is deeply pigmented and also buildable (I prefer just one for a little less pigmentation). I personally feel the shade would go well with all skin tones. For me personally, I tend to use more natural shades, but this is nice for days where I want a more bold look. It has a slight hint of a vanilla scent. It is a creamy formula that applies smoothly onto lips. It does have a slightly sticky feel, but it seems to help the product stay on for a good amount of time. I am a beauty enthusiast who has tried several different lip glosses and I like this one, next time Iu2019ll go for a more natural shade (which is available).

I just need to apply it on my lips once more and my lips will always be beautiful all day. I like it very much and I have introduced it to my colleagues and sisters. Sometimes there are sales and I have bought other colors to change every day, making my lips beautiful every day.

I can see this color complementing different skin tones and undertones. It is definitely a gloss and while it isn't super sticky, it does have some tack to it and isn't light like a lip oil. It does last a while though without too much eating or drinking. The smell is a light vanilla and isn't noticeable once applied, but I like the scent. You can use it with a lip liner or alone, and over top of lipstick to add shine."

Being able to try the GXVE Bubble Pop Electric High-Shine Lip Gloss has me obsessed! It's sleek, chic, and feels luxurious to the touch, setting the stage for a premium product experience. Upon applying the lip gloss, the first thing I noticed was the texture. True to its description, the formula is indeed creamy and cushiony, melting into my lips with an incredibly comfortable feel. There's none of that sticky, tacky sensation that often comes with high-shine glosses. Instead, it feels hydrating and lightweight, almost as if I'm not wearing anything on my lips at all. I was impressed with the buildable color of the Bubble Pop Electric gloss. A single swipe provides a sheer wash of color thatu2019s perfect for a more natural look, while additional layers amp up the intensity for a more dramatic effect. As for its staying power, the gloss delivers on its long-wearing promise. It stays put without moving or bleeding, maintaining its shiny finish for hours. I was particularly pleased to find that it layers seamlessly over lipstick or lip liner, allowing for versatility in creating different looks.

I have been super intrigued with skin care and finding new product that works for me to be able to share with friends, family, and clients. I was beyond excited to be able to try out Bubble Pop Electric High-Shine Lip Gloss. I know most people donu2019t like gloss but I happen to absolutely love them! The first thing that stood out to me was the packaging and the scent. The scent was a mix of vanilla and light hint of caramel in my opinion and reminds me of candy. The applicator brush had me worried because of how flat it was and I honestly thought it would be stiff but it was absolutely soft and made for an easier application. The sticky consistency wasnu2019t my favorite but I do appreciate that it wasnu2019t too thick or too light it was in between. Sweet Tooth was not great on me it washed out my lips completely. All my Love in the other hand was just perfect! I think itu2019s definitely a universal shade for any skin tone. I do wish it lasted longer I feel it comes off quicker than I would wish."

The packaging itself is so sleek and simple that it just gives fancy vibes. I love the fact that this lip gloss comes in a clear tube which makes it easier for me to see the true color of it. It comes with a nice size applicator so I donu2019t see anyone having any issues with it. These glosses smell like sugar cookies or some type of other sweet dessert and I swear my stomach started growling at how good it smelled lol.  I remember going to the beauty supply store and getting lip gloss and it was always sooo sticky to the point where it would cause build up in the corners of my mouth. The consistency for this lip gloss is sticky too which did have me worried at first but when I tell you this is great I MEAN THAT. Itu2019s almost like this gloss attaches itself to your lips and stays in place like glue or something but in a good way.  I normally do a nude ombre lip but the gloss in the shade u201csweet toothu201d really took the term ombre and created its own definition for it. I really appreciated the thickness of this gloss because it prevented me from having to use 3 or 4 lip products just to get the look I desired. Using just the gloss mixed with the black lip liner gave me the perfect and I mean PERFECT ombre lip.  Personally, the lip gloss acts as a lipstick as well because of the rich color and due to how it just stays in place without needing to put in too much work. The shade u201cAll My Loveu201d is beautiful too. I can definitely see me wearing this by itself or maybe even on top of a dark red lipstick."

Iu2019d give it three stars because of this.  Now, onto u201cAll My Love.u201d This shade is an absolute winner! The formula is just as fantastic as with u201cSweet Tooth,u201d but the color is a stunning, versatile shade that looks amazing on a variety of skin tones. Itu2019s a beautiful, everyday color that adds the perfect touch of shine and dimension to my lips. Iu2019d give it five stars without hesitation.  Overall, while u201cSweet Toothu201d didnu2019t quite hit the mark for me personally, u201cAll My Loveu201d has become a staple in my makeup routine. If youu2019re in the market for a clean lip gloss with high-performance formula and gorgeous color, u201cAll My Loveu201d is definitely the way to go."

It smells like a delicious Vanilla Cupcake. I enjoyed using both these glosses. Both the shades are beautiful. But if I had to pick one, I like the shade All My Love better. I think it definitely compliments my skin tone and looks so good on me. I love the color and shine it gives my lips.   The gloss is light weight and has such a smooth texture. It doesn't feel heavy on the lips. It is also very long lasting and keeps my lips moisturized and hydrated the entire day. Infact I didnt have to re apply it again and again throughout the day.   I highly recommend these lip glosses to those looking for a pigmented and hydrating gloss. These will not only add incredible color and shine to your lips but also keep your lips soft, smooth and looking beautiful.   *This review was collected as part of a promotion.*"

It glides on effortlessly, providing a luscious sheen that adds a touch of glamour to any look. The ease of application is another plus, making it a convenient option for on-the-go touch-ups.  However, one major downside for me is the sticky consistency. Despite its beautiful shine and texture, I found the gloss to be uncomfortably sticky, which detracted from the overall experience. It's a shame because otherwise, it would have been a top contender in my makeup bag.  In terms of shades, All My Love stole my heart with its perfect hue that complemented my skin tone beautifully. On the other hand, Sweet Tooth missed the marku2014it was too light for my complexion and didn't flatter me at all.  On a brighter note, the lip gloss has an amazing scent that adds to the overall enjoyment of wearing it. Plus, knowing that it's vegan and cruelty-free brings me peace of mind and aligns with my values.  I also appreciate that the gloss doesn't bleed. However, I found the lasting power to be just okayu2014it didn't quite live up to my expectations, especially considering its other impressive qualities.  In conclusion, while this lip gloss has its strengths, including its shine, creamy texture, and appealing scent, the stickiness and underwhelming lasting power were major drawbacks for me. With some improvements in these areas, it could easily become a favorite in my beauty routine.   I would recommend it for those who can overlook the stickiness and prioritize the other positive aspects."

The design of the lip gloss was also attractive. I got two colors; u201csweet toothu201d which is a peach color and u201call my loveu201d which is warm berry. Sweet tooth was a bit harsh on my skin tone when I used it alone. When I combined it with my go-to lip liner (Chestnut by MAC), it was acceptable. All my love was perfect. I did not need to subdue it with a lip liner. It had a nice berry colored tint to it.   Both smelled AMAZING. Almost like an edible piece of candy. The lip glosses had great shine, were buildable, thick, and mildly sticky. They lasted about 5 hours (in the absence of me eating) before I had to retouch it. I recommend this. Will be getting all my love again."

It is a beautiful natural peach color and nude look, but I like bolder shades or colors with a bit more warmth to them. They have a great selection of colors, from sheer pinks to bold reds, so I am confident bold colors match my skin tone more.

The long-wearing formula stays put without bleeding or migrating, ensuring that my lips look great for hours on end. As someone who values clean beauty, I appreciate that this lip gloss is vegan, gluten-free, and cruelty-free.

The packaging is stunning, high quality and super fun and trendy, totally on brand for her. While I didn't love the formula or the scent, I did feel like these glosses were pretty hydrating on the lips and I loved the shades I tried. They look much darker in the tube than on the lips, but since it's a gloss that's to be expected. The scent was very sweet, but not terrible, just not my favorite. The formula itself was just a bit thicker and kinda sticky for me. I found using it over my lips once I lined and filled them in with liner worked best and gave me better results. I just typically prefer a more silky feeling gloss, versus being a bit on the sticky side. The color and the shine is on point though, so it depends a lot on your personal preference. Definitely worth a try if you love a thicker gloss!"

One thing, particularly was the smell somewhere between vanilla and marshmallows. I tried to shades one called sweet tooth, and the other called all my love. I think from my skin tone, the sweet tooth was very unflattering as someone with east Asian skin because it almost made me look like I didnu2019t have lips or it was blending in with my cheek, so didnu2019t really like that. However, I really enjoyed the shade all my love. I thought it added a perfect touch of color without being too overdramatic, but still have that glossy brownish pinkish orange hue. For both of them I really liked how it felt on my lips and I thought it felt almost a bit moisturizing as well. I would definitely recommend!!"

One thing I think could be improved is the consistency of the formula. I like my gloss to be hydrating and not sticky, and this was more of a thick, heavy gloss. It did provide high shine but seemed to wear off quickly, maybe due to the stickiness. This alone was not a dealbreaker for me and I will continue to wear it as a fun addition to my purse, when I donu2019t need something thatu2019s lasts a long time."

The tube has a lot of product inside and to get a shine on your lips, you only need a small amount. The shine lasts for hours and can be easily reapplied.   You can layer this lip gloss with other colors to achieve a different look. The lip gloss is great for color if you want to put a thicker coat on.

Sweet Tooth doesnu2019t look good with my skin tone by itself, but I can probably mix it with some other lip products and make it work.  All My Love is a beautiful shade probably my favorite from the collection and it looks perfect with my skin tone. You can wear these in every season with no problem. The formula is smooth and creamy. I really like that the lipgloss has a scent, I believe itu2019s caramel or vanilla. The gloss spreads easily and has good coverage. Itu2019s lasts long too. When I was ready to wash it off it required a lip scrub after, my lips felt a bit tacky. Overall a great lipgloss for everyone."

This is nothing like that.  I love glosses. I don't love how sticky they can be. Or my hair getting stuck to my lips. Worse still is having them melt half off your face. So call me surprised when this gloss did none of the above.  It has an amazing vanilla frosting like scent. The color payout for a gloss is stunning and rich. My lips actually felt moisturized after wearing it. There was no feathering or moving. It will transfer of course. But not move all over your face. It didn't feel goopy. Just wonderfully light and luxurious.  I recieved several compliments while wearing all my love, which, is my fave shade. I had to tell people what brand I was wearing.  Vegan and cruelty free. Clean product. Great for any beauty lover or expert."

I can line them up and match them with lipglosses I already own. I am satisfied as long as the lipgloss does what itu2019s supposed to. In my opinion, a lipgloss should give enough coverage and make your lips look juicy. I have naturally large lips and the wrong shade of lipgloss can make my lips look bigger than they already are. I have lips similar to Bratz dolls, so I stay away from lipglosses that are too loud. I was able to wear this the whole day. I did have to reapply a couple times but thatu2019s fine. I eat a lot, so my lipgloss wears off quickly. Oh, and it smells good too."

It's great that I'm able to switch up on which colour lipgloss to wear each day to coordinate with my clothing. I also like to pair the lipglosses with a lipliner. The applicator glides the lip content onto my lips seamlessly. My lips feels luscious and soft to the touch with a shiny appearance. The I'm Still Here Flannel and All My Love glosses are my favourite out of the bunch, with Sweet Tooth being the least liked. Sweet Tooth is too light for my complexion. Perhaps, it'll work better for those with fair/olive tone skin. Honestly, it does tend to transfer onto items such as food, drinking glasses and utensils. A touch up every now and again won't hurt. Also, I found the glosses a tad bit sticky for my taste. But, overall I'm satisfied. I recommend GXVE to those who are looking to make their lips plump, add shine, creamy texture, etc."

Sweet Tooth is a great nude pink and I feel that I would love it even more in the summer. I was just not sold on the application and texture of this specific color. However, All My Love, looked amazing on my lips and had a much thinner consistency. The color is a perfect fall/winter rosy wine color that would look amazing with all skin tones. This did not feel dry on my lips and looked amazing with and without a lip liner. I do wish the applicator was slightly bigger. I will definitely be gravitating to All My Love more often!"

Upon applying the lip gloss, the first thing I noticed was the texture. True to its description, the formula is indeed creamy and cushiony, melting into my lips with an incredibly comfortable feel. There's none of that sticky, tacky sensation that often comes with high-shine glosses. Instead, it feels hydrating and lightweight, almost as if I'm not wearing anything on my lips at all. I was impressed with the buildable color of the Bubble Pop Electric gloss. A single swipe provides a sheer wash of color thatu2019s perfect for a more natural look, while additional layers amp up the intensity for a more dramatic effect. As for its staying power, the gloss delivers on its long-wearing promise. It stays put without moving or bleeding, maintaining its shiny finish for hours. I was particularly pleased to find that it layers seamlessly over lipstick or lip liner, allowing for versatility in creating different looks. Whether worn alone or as a finishing touch over other lip products, it adds shine and dimension without compromising the wear time. The GXVE Bubble Pop Electric High-Shine Lip Gloss has exceeded my expectations in nearly every way. From its luxurious application and comfortable wear to its impressive shine and color payoff, it's a product that delivers on its promises.

            "review_text": "I recently added the Bubble Pop Electric Lip Gloss in the shade All My Love to my collection, and it has quickly become a lip essential for me. Already a fan of the shade Sweet Tooth, I had high expectations, and I'm happy to say that this gloss exceeded them.  All My Love is a beautiful warm berry, and the color is just as stunning as described. The creamy, high-shine formula provides a multidimensional, mirror-like finish that gives the illusion of fuller, plumper lips. It's the perfect touch of warmth for any makeup look.  What sets this lip gloss apart is its buildable color. Whether you want a subtle sheen or a more intense pop of color, it's easily achievable with just a few swipes. The formula contains spherical powders that allow it to glide on evenly, providing a superior, wet, glass-like shine that lasts.  The long-wearing benefits are a major plus. Once applied, it stays in place without moving or bleeding, giving me confidence in its longevity throughout the day. The cushiony texture is a dream u2013 it melts into my lips for comfortable, non-sticky wear.  I appreciate that this product is vegan, gluten-free, and cruelty-free. It aligns with my values, and the fact that it can be layered seamlessly over lipstick or lip liner for added shine and dimension makes it a versatile addition to my makeup routine.  In conclusion, the Bubble Pop Electric Lip Gloss in All My Love is a winner. It combines beautiful color, a mirror-like finish, and long-lasting wear in a formula that feels comfortable on the lips. If you're a lip gloss enthusiast, this is definitely one to try for a touch of warmth and dimension to your pout."

The GXVE Bubble Pop Electric High-Shine Lip Gloss is an opaque gloss in colors that remind me of early 2000s makeup looks. Just like the lipstick, the lipgloss was super sticky and i ended up wiping it off and using something else instead. I tried the shade sweet tooth and i was surprised at how opaque it was. I tried applying it over the liquid lipstick and it completely washed the color out. Perhaps this shade just didnt suit me. The smell also reminded me of those claire lipgloss palettes i used to get when i was younger, and just like those, this made my lips pale which mixed in with my already pale complexion was a no no. In all i wanted to try this brand because i was a big gwen stefani fan when i was younger. If you want to wear a gloss on its own i would reccomend this otherwise its not for layering."

The brand's commitment to Sephora's clean beauty initiative, coupled with Gwen Stefani's endorsement, initially drew me in, and this lip gloss certainly lived up to the anticipation. What sets it apart is its non-sticky formula, which, instead of feeling heavy, gracefully moisturizes my lips, leaving them with a luscious, extra-glossy finish. The diverse range of shades offered is incredibly appealing, each displaying a highly pigmented color that brings a vibrant pop to my lips. Not only does the gloss deliver in terms of aesthetics, but it also boasts a pleasant overall scent, enhancing the sensory experience. Importantly, its long-lasting wear ensures that I don't find myself reaching for reapplication frequently, making it a reliable and standout product in my collection."

You can honestly tell that itu2019s a very hydrating formula and it clings to lips without really shifting around or bleeding into lines and wrinkles around your mouth. I loved that the color, once applied, looked bright, but natural. I even appreciated how long this gloss actually lasted on, even as it wore off, the color, faded evenly and nicely.

While the color may appeal to many for a nude look, I found it less flattering on my lips. Achieving definition required a chocolate brown or deeper pencil, and the gloss felt somewhat gummy and appeared patchy. Perhaps age plays a role, as I'm over 50, but overall, it didn't provide the smooth appearance I expected, though this could be influenced by the chosen color."

She is the perfect mix of rebel punk rockstar meets glamorous beauty like me. When I heard of GXVE Beauty, I jumped at the chance to try it for myself and wear makeup made and inspired by one of my favorite female pop meets punk rock singers. The GXVE Beauty Bubble Pop Electric High-Performance Lip-Gloss has such a luxurious, smooth formulation. It has a beautiful, light, creamy lip gloss texture. I had the pleasure of trying two shades of this lip gloss, the All My Love and Sweet Tooth shades. The Sweet Tooth shade is a light, sheer, nude, pink shade on my lips. All My Love is my favorite shade of this lipgloss. Itu2019s a light, rosy pink color on my lips.  I love its gourmand flavor of vanilla. It smells and tastes like vanilla frosting. It takes me back to the lipglosses I used to love as a preteen and teen. Itu2019s doe foot applicator helps spread the right amount of lipgloss evenly on my lips. My lips feel so hydrated, glamorous and ready to rock. It is very easy and fun to layer both shades to create a bolder look. The lipgloss tube is clear with black letters on it with a black lid that holds the doe foot applicator.  Its box is a light brown color and has a fun red and white design on the inside. I would highly recommend this to any rebellious rockstar in their teens and older looking for a lipgloss that takes you back to the eary 2000u2019s and gives your lips a beautiful shine and wonderful hydration."

The stylish tube stands out independently with a large doe-applicator to swipe enough gloss. However, I did find the formula to be a bit more on the thicker side, but once I let it sit awhile, it wasnu2019t sticky. I noticed that it had a light scent of sweet vanilla, which was delightful and awakened my senses.  This gloss-high shine is unstoppable and does impress. The texture is comfortable for daily wear and complements my olive skin tone. I like that the shade ranges from bold to subtle nudes. Yet, I fell for the u201cSweet Toothu201d shade as I enjoy creating the ultimate 90s nude lip vibe by adding a medium brown lip liner. I didnu2019t need to touch up my pout that much throughout the day and keep my lips hydrated. "

The formula is definitely there it glides onto the lips with ease and has an amazing shine to it. So like some lip glosses it is sticky, now that is not a total downfall but for me itu2019s not for windy days with my hair down. If you know then you know. Besides that i truly did like the way it felt and how long it wears for. I tried it alone and even on top of lipstick and it performs beautifully. The smell is sweet like sweet candy I live when makeup has a good scent to it. The  packaging is so gorgeous and the applicator is the perfect shape for applying to lips. I would definitely recommend giving the Bubble Pop Electric Lip Gloss a try!"

Lip gloss is something that I was not a huge fan of for quite some time, but I have slowly been coming around. My issue is usually that I feel like I am left feeling sticky and that if there is a shade or color it's usually quite transparent if it even shows at all. Neither were the case for me with the Bubble Pop Electric High-Performance Clean Lip Gloss. It goes on smoothly and precisely, and the color is VIVID and beautiful. The gloss is shiny and glass like but appears elegant, not like a lip smacker someone just slapped on. It smells DELICIOUS, and I was shocked at how well it held up even after a night out that involved drinking a few cocktails! This is definitely a new staple for me and I will be recommending it to all of my friends and clients!"

I am very sensitive to smells and anything too sweet can give me an instant headache and nausea. This lipgloss has a very sweet caramel scent to it. In regards to application, I found it to be sticky on its own. It wore better on top of the matte liquid lipstick. It definitely is a high shine gloss as stated in the name, so I will give it that. The applicator design ensures easy and precise application, enhancing the overall user experience. If you are not sensitive to smell and enjoy a high shine lipgloss that comes in pretty colors, you will enjoy this product. I would recommend this product for anyone seeking a glossy, show-stopping pout who doesn't mind scented products."

First off I love that these have a slight color to them that you can actually see on the lips if you want to wear them by themse ves. I love that you can pair these with their mat lipsticks just to give a glossier look. These look glossy and are juicy and my favorite part is they smell like vanilla cake and wear beautifully throughout the day. I can't wait to add these to my professional kit so my clients can test these out as well. They truly leave a beautiful shine on your lips and last throughout the day. I was so surprised that these glosses truly lasted."

One swipe leaves a luxe rich color, but it is buildable. For lighter shades like u2018Dolled Upu2019, I usually do two for fullest coverage (like Iu2019m gonna get stares). On the lips itu2019s very interesting; maybe the closest comparison is a lip lacquer crossed with a balm. The texture is wet but not sticky, and it feels solidly in place. This gloss is definitely high-performance and lasts all day, even through meals (there is some transfer, it stayed on one of my cups through a heavy wash cycle!). Which is wild for a lip-gloss, I feel like my lips are staying hydrated and gorgeous but not weighed down by the heaviness of a lipstick. I love that the color doesnu2019t bleed or fade, itu2019s very soft and creamy and does a great job coating the lips fully. My absolute favorite aspect is that shine tho! I added some unedited pics of my lips, yu2019all, they are not that luscious! That is all heavy-lifting by the gloss, I feel like I have the K-Beauty glassy douyin lips of my dreams. Shine and saturation for days, and it sits in every little corner and groove to give that illusion of thiccer and juicier mirror lips. Iu2019m very happy with u2018Dolled Upu2019, excited to try the other shades! My sincere gratitude to GXVE for gifting me this stunning lip-gloss."

For those sensitive to scents, please be aware that this gloss has a cotton candy body spray type fragrance. It's nostalgic, but isn't for everyone."

It is also very thick so sheering it down is work. My lips are very pigmented so I like to put on a full application and then basically blot it down to a thin layer, or layer it with another color.

One layer is fine and moisture feeling. - More opaque than most my glosses, I love that. - Pretty colors but wish there were more, especially some u2018mediumu2019 berry or mauve tones - Smell is not bad, kind of a medium scent, but I donu2019t prefer it. Itu2019s not a deal breaker tho. To me, itu2019s not coconut, itu2019s more like a nutty baked good. So not bad, just prefer no fragrance or fruity instead. - Packaging is of course cool Gwen style and I like it overall. The applicator comes out with a good amount, as the tube thing cleans it off nicely when pulling it out. However, donu2019t really love the small doe foot. Actually prefer old school tubes tbh, but regardless the doe foot seems a bit flimsy, but not really terrible. - Good price point for the formula and packaging. Although, Iu2019m not too sure there is a ton of product after getting through the exterior packaging. - Wears well. Of course gloss comes off on straws or cups, etc but the leftovers still feel nice and thin layers stick around until wiped off. Doesnu2019t bleed on me.  Bought the color Candy and itu2019s so pretty, but I will be exchanging the color because this doesnu2019t show up enough on me to make enough of a difference to want to wear it or pay for it. Itu2019s just because itu2019s too similar to my natural color it seems. Patiently waiting for more colors :)"

I will say that I noticed that sweet tooth is more opaque than the other two, but I think this is intentional.  It allows you to choose the intensity, and since super nude lips are usually so patchy, I think the extra pigment here is great!

WHAT I LIKED: * Lightweight, thinner formula * High shine * Goes on smoothly * Light scent - itu2019s on the sweet side but not overwhelming (I didnu2019t pick up the vanilla scent others have mentioned but the scent does lean on the sweet side) * Pigmentation on most of the shades is really good for this type of gloss; the shade Candy was the least pigmented of all the ones in this first release of shades * All My Love is a pretty MLBB color, and I like that it leans on the cool-neutral side  AREA(S) FOR IMPROVEMENT: * Longevity - I donu2019t expect glosses to wear all day but a little more lasting power wouldnu2019t hurt. I can get about 2-3 hours if Iu2019m not eating or drinking; otherwise, itu2019s an hour, maybe 2.  FYI / OTHER THOUGHTS: * Would love to see more colors in the future. The neutral, neutral-cool undertones of the current collection works for me but it would be nice to see some shades with warm undertones as well."

I have been searching for a creamy baby pink lipgloss with no shimmer/glitter that has good pigment for years now. This is a great gloss. i love that it has a vanilla frosting scent/taste as opposed to a mint- i cannot stand mint things on my lips. i debated between this gloss and the candy color which i may try in store but based on pictures and reviews from others this one was more pigmented and im happy i went with this one. LOVE it and hope they make it for a long time. also yes the texture has some stick to it but honestly if you want your gloss to really stay on and keep its pigment it needs to have some element of stick to it. This is very on par with mac lipglass in terms of texture."

The formula blends very nicely leaving a nice light tint after a few hrs of wear, it also stays put, no bleedding.This would be awesome with a lip liner or over lipstick too.

The color I received is called Sweet Tooth, a pale peachy pink.  It is a creamy high-shine lip gloss that has a mirror-like finish and looks glassy.  It is pretty sticky, which I am not a fan of. It also smells like vanilla, which I could do without.  Why does a lip product need fragrance? I can wear this alone or over lipstick.  It seals in the color and keeps it from bleeding or budging and gives it a glossy finish.  I like the look, but not the feel or the scent."

Almost a slight bit of an occlusive feel to it, I would say. There is a very light but pleasant scent that reminds me of sunscreen.  The shade sweet tooth immediately took me back to the trends of the early aughts (perfectly in line with No Doubt haha!) It might not be for everyone, but it is a fun nostalgic shade."

I got the shade candy and it is the perfect bubbly pinkish purple gloss. It kept my lips shiny and hydrated all day as I was wearing it. It doesnu2019t make my lips feel sticky and the product completely melts onto my lips leaving a flawless finish. I would 100% recommend this product."

It's almost natural after blending it in my lips. It's not a high gloss. And it's not real thin in consistency. What it is- it's really pretty! It has the classic GXVE sort of coconut flavor/scent. It's very moisturizing. I tried is first on bare lips and found it very natural looking. A no makeup, makeup look. Then over Stompbox and it's gorgeous! I don't typically like thicker glosses but I love this!"
