Literally the creamiest powder blush Iu2019ve ever used. Because Iu2019ve been tanning recently, I chose 09 Intense Plum & Iu2019m so happy I did. Iu2019m obsessed with the shade. Itu2019s pretty both sheer & bold. More speaking, Gucci blush is very buildable. Even better, this blush blends very easily; almost melting into the skin like butter. Iu2019ve included swatches of Intense Plumu2014 the left showing one layer & the right showing two. With & without flash. In addition to being creamy & blendable, the formula of this blush is extremely hydrating while maintaining a matte finish. Also, the packaging is super cute & includes a mirror making it travel friendly, which is awesome. Before deciding how much I loved this blush, I wore Gucci blush during a night out & also at work while exerting physical labor. I noticed it was much longer lasting than I originally assumed it would be. Even after sweating for a bit with a sheer application, it still looked freshu2014 closely resembling being naturally flushed. The only downside is the price point as it may seem a bit steep to the budget friendly makeup girlies. But I promise, itu2019s worth it. All in all, I definitely recommend this blush to anyone who appreciates great, high-end makeup products!"

The shade Intense Plum is everythingu2014super pigmented, so you only need a little for a soft, everyday look, but it builds beautifully for a bold, dramatic vibe. The texture is smooth and blends like a dream on both cheeks and eyelids. No scent, which is a big win for me. Itu2019s honestly such a luxe product, and I canu2019t wait to try the other shades!"

You can create a subtle or more intense look, depending on the occasion and your likes.

I was disappointed, because I don't think any of the other permanent colors would work for me if 01-Silky Rose didn't (02-Tender Apricot would definitely be too orange for me, and 05-Rosy Beige looks like it would be too gray).  I was incredibly excited to see 10-Soft Peach released for the holidays!  I ordered it, and I absolutely love it.  It is a fantastic every day blush color, but the color can also be built up in intensity.  The formula of this color is also just as good as the formula of the permanent colors.  I really hope that 10-Soft Peach is added as a permanent color - I really feel that it fills a gap in the current lineup of colors for this blush, and I want to be able to repurchase it when I run out!"

I doo like to do a wash on my eyelids too. Very simple and healthy loking. I adore the packaging. I bought on the Klarna plan (it is pricy, ets' face it) but I love seeing it on my shelf, makes me feel like a glamourous socialite from the 60s. Nice mirror in the compact, too.

It's been over a year and I've barely made a dint in it so I'd say it's pretty good value even though it's the most expensive blush I've ever owned. Totally worth it."

            "review_text": "For reference, I have combination skin: oily and eczema prone. The pictures included have zero filters or alterations.  This is a soft, blendable blush with a sheen of luminosity. Shade 4 leans more orange than coral-pink on my medium olive skin. Shade 4 would flatter anyone with an olive, neutral, and/or warm undertone with a fair to medium skin tone.  PROS: -The pearl finish leaves a fresh gleam without any chunks of glitter or obvious sparkle. -I swatched this around dry patches/textured areas of my face. The shimmer didn't emphasize the texture and it didn't catch onto any patches. -The packaging is sturdy with a secure clasp. I'm able to pop the latch open without issues from my long nails. It feels like it would last a couple of drops. -The blush is buildable so you can control the intensity of color. It makes it great for a beginner and those who prefer a soft finish.  MINUS 1 STAR: -The price. You'd have to be a fan of luxury to justify paying $49 for a blush. Full disclosure, I received this for free as a training product. I personally would wait for a sale to splurge on buying 1 shade.  NITPICKS: -The blush is buildable, BUT it took a bit for it to show up on me. The soft wash of color it gives and the fact that most of the shades have a white pigment base means that the blushes cater to lighter skin tones. Shades 6, 8 and 9 have richer pigments for those with more melanin rich skin than me. Anyone can wear any shade, but I don't personally reach for blushes that I have to build up a ton. -It blends better over a powdered face. I sometimes apply powder blush before I set my face for a dewy finish style of makeup, but this didn't work with that technique. Versatility is more of a personal preference for me, so this might not apply to everyone's style."

Once you take the blush out of the box, it will reveal a gorgeous little compact! Yes, itu2019s actually a little compact, it has a mirror. That was a fun surprise! The color is so pretty and the texture is smooth. There is a bit of a scent that I would say is some type of floral. I donu2019t tend to love floral scents but I was fine with this one. I took one star off because as beautiful and feminine as the color is, it will easily wipe right off the skin with a tissue. So to wear this blush successfully, Iu2019d recommend a good setting spray and perhaps keep the compact on hand for any possible touch ups-maybe thatu2019s why itu2019s a blush with a built in mirror! Considering the price point, I would have liked it to be more long lasting but itu2019s overall a very nice makeup product and if you are okay with possibly reapplying throughout the day, then this just might be a good fit for you!"

I absolutely love this blush, the packaging is gold and pale peach with gold stars which it looks great in your makeup pouch. It comes with a mirror included so thatu2019s a perk and it has u201cGucciu201d printed on top of the packaging and on top of the product itself. The color I received was 04 Bright Coral which has a matte finish and you can apply a light layer for a natural look or apply a bit more for a pop of color which is very easy to do because the product is very easy to blend and layer. The product can be apply as eyeshadow too besides blush so when I applied it to my cheeks and eyes it made my green eyes pop out a lot more, it intensified the green of my eyes and received so many compliments. The product felt very light on my skin and it lasted all day without fading away throughout the day."

Personally I liked the formula since it was pigmented but also blendable. However the color (true pink) was really not for me. I have light medium skin with warm undertones and this pink color just did not look great. It doesnu2019t look terrible and I can still make it work with a light application and by adding other blushes, but I would definitely consider getting this in another shade for blush. As eyeshadow it works well, but wouldnu2019t be my first option. I still have other blushes that I would prefer over this one, but it makes for a good gift. Overall I think this is a good product (with a hefty price tag) as long as you find a shade that works for you."

Every time I apply it the color remains intact for around 6 hours. Thatu2019s a game changer! Not only on my cheeks but in my eyes like shadows too. 2. This blush is so gentle to apply and although it has very nice pigment, layer by layer I decide the intensity of the color unlike others. 3. This contains Hyaluronic Acid that helps hydrate the skin and also has a floral aroma that I am in love with.   And honestly the list can go on because I'm with it, this one has a very functional mirror, the size is perfect to carry everywhere, there is no loose powder after each application even when I applied it with a brush. Also, when I use it as an eyeshadow, I have used my fingers to blend it and again I can say that it is a very functional product and highly recommended.  I received this product for free from @gucci and @influenster in exchange for my honest review."

It claims to have an adaptable formula of smooth powders and pigments that has been infused with emollient waxes to provide buildable, long-lasting color! It also has a hydrating formula with ultra-thin powders that is suitable for all skin types, which is great for me since I have sensitive skin! It has been infused with Shea Butter, Hyaluronic Acid and Black Rose Gold to create a second-skin feel once applied. This is a scented product and I do like the scent, it isn't overpowering and once applied you can't smell it but if you have skin that doesn't love scented makeup products this is something to keep in mind. I love that I can use it both on the eyes and cheeks and for a product that is on the expensive side I love that you can get a couple of different uses out of it. The powder itself has a luminous matte finish and it applies so smoothly and blends with ease. It's long wearing and holds up for the day without the need to reapply. It adds a healthy look to the cheeks that I can't get enough of. Great product!!"

The blush glides onto the skin effortlessly, delivering a smooth and velvety finish. Unlike some matte blushes that can appear flat or chalky, Gucci's formula manages to strike the perfect balance between matte and luminous, giving the skin a natural-looking radiance without any shimmer.The pigmentation is another standout feature of this blush. With just a light swipe of the product, you can achieve a subtle flush of color that can easily be built up for a more intense look. The shade range is also impressive, offering options to suit a variety of skin tones.One of the things I appreciate most about this blush is its longevity. Once applied, it stays put throughout the day without fading or becoming patchy. This is particularly important for those with oily or combination skin, as it means you won't have to worry about constant touch-ups.If you're in the market for a high-end blush that will elevate your makeup routine, look no further than this beauty from Gucci."

I just knew it wouldn't work when I opened it and sighed with disappointment when I stood in front of the mirror and picked up my blush brush. Nope, it's not going to work I thought as I dabbed my brush into the rose scented product in a beautiful, elegant compact. I think I did a triple take after I actually applied it--it was GORGEOUS! I couldn't believe it! It looks so fantastic on my skin tone. The pigmentation is perfect--it blends flawlessly. Even when I really go HAM and apply a ton of it it just looks like my skin and my natural color. I adore this blush so much which blows my mind. I have never once used a blush in this color range before because I thought it would look terrible. I always bought neutral rose or mauve blushes before but this blush unlocked warm reds for me for which I am very grateful!"

I prefer my blushes this way since it is harder to go overboard on accident. The finish is matte, but it looks nice a natural on the skin. It blends well with other products. 10/10  Price: I was provided this for free to try in exchange for my honest feedback. That being said, while a solid choice in a lot of ways, for the price, you have many options at a lower price point, especially in this color.  If it's within your budget, I would say buy it, and I think you will be happy. I, myself, would consider picking this up in other shades as a treat yo self moment. 7/10"

Its color is reminiscent of nars famous shade, the staying power on Gucciu2019s is much better in comparison. I still have the rosy, lit from within glow at night that I buffed on to the apples of my cheeks at the beginning of the day, which is some seriously impressive staying power for a powdered blush. For clarity, the formula does have a bit of shimmer, which adds to the overall luminescence the blush gives you. It is so incredibly pretty on different skin tones, adding just the right amount of warmth without being too much. Finally, even its packaging is a work of art. Itu2019s luxe and gorgeous while still being very well made, this will hold up well in your makeup bag/purse and on the go which is an important factor for many. Highly recommend!"

You can use as little or as much as you'd like to, in order to help you achieve the look you desire. 10 out of 10, recommend.  I received this product for free in exchange for my honest opinion."

The texture is really nice, itu2019s softer pressed silky powder with a nice sheen. Blends great with the skin. I had all shades, the pinks, when lightly applied, are all pretty close, just subtle differences, so you can pick up any. The plum shade actually is my most favorite plum blush shade, itu2019s just perfect color representative in my opinion.  I do recommend this blush, if your budget allows. If not, nothing to worry about :)"

What I love most is its versatility; it works beautifully as both a cheek and eye color, making it a staple in my makeup routine. The ultra-thin powder effortlessly blends for a flawless finish every time, and the added ingredients like Shea Butter and Hyaluronic Acid ensure my skin stays hydrated and comfortable. And let's not forget the delightful scent of Vintage Peony, which adds a touch of luxury to the experience. Overall, this blush has become a favorite in my collection, delivering both stunning color and skincare benefits."

Itu2019s very highly pigmented so a little powder goes a long way, and the product should last a long time. I put a little on my fingers and blended it onto my cheeks and eyelids - itu2019s multi-use, you can use it as an eyeshadow too. It looks extra pretty having your eyeshadow match your blush and with the easily buildable coverage you could experiment with different looks like intense eyeshadow and subtle blush. You really can achieve both subtle and dramatic looks with this blush and everything in between. You could wear it every day and for special occasions alike. Itu2019s a really good quality product with an excellent satiny smooth powder texture that is easy to use to create whatever lovely look youu2019re going through. I honestly canu2019t recommend it enough, and the Intense Plum is a gorgeous vibrant shade that would flatter any skin tone, this blush truly has to be experienced. Invest in some!"

Let me start by saying Iu2019m not a blush person. Maybe itu2019s that my skin already gives off a pink glimmer or that I am just scared of not using it properly(I was a kid in the 80u2019s so I have good reason to believe this, if you remember blush from the 80u2019s) I was a bridesmaid in a wedding and the MUA applied blush. I didnu2019t hate it but I also never really invested time into learning how to apply it so I didnu2019t look like a circus clown. I chose this peach shade, hoping that it wouldnu2019t expose more of the redness in my skin. At first, it looked like I applied it too heavily and was about to have orange stained tears rolling down my cheeks. I blended it out into a soft peach color and actually liked the results. Maybe I will start to ease up my hesitation on blush now. Other stand out features to this product is the packaging! This is exactly what I would expect from Gucci. Beautiful gold features with little gold stars. The Gucci name imprinted into the blush and the prominent logo on top of the compact. It looks quite stunning amongst my makeup collection.  *I received this complimentary of Influenster to try out and give my honest opinion about*"

I chose a darker rosy shade because I have many brighter pink ones similar to the other options available. The packaging is surprising for what is considered a luxery brand. Mostly a very light plastic and metal compact style with interior mirror. The powder is very soft but not as pigmented as I expected.  I can't detect any rose in the beigy tone of the powder on my skin. It looks like a moderate bronzer on me. It is a matte as advertised so no sparkling. But it also wipes off pretty easily wnhich means it would require a fair amount to set."

The packaging of this is absolutely gorgeous - a rose gold and pink compact with a mirror inside. However itu2019s a little hard to get open and I was afraid I was going to nick the inside with my finger nail trying to get it open. When applying to cheeks it goes on like butter, so silky and smooth! Iu2019m not sure why itu2019s called luminous matte, I would describe this as just plain old matte. There is no glitter/sparkle or anything like that that would make this appear anything other than matte. It blends so nicely with buildable coverage if you want a more pigmented look. Usually powder blush doesnu2019t last that long on my skin without applying over top of cream blush but this lasted for almost 4 hours on its own before starting to fade!"

The formula of this blush is beyond stellar. Itu2019s silky smooth and adheres to your skin so naturally. Another major perk is that it looks just as fresh and vibrant at the end of the day as it does when you first apply it u2014 which is a hard thing to find in most blushes. I also love that this blush has a slight sheen to it but isnu2019t sparkly. This makes it the perfect choice for everyday wear. Itu2019s also very blendable and lasts a long time since a little bit goes a long way. In my opinion, this Gucci Blush is fully worth the hype. It does have a slightly higher price point than most blush options on the market, but because it lasts so long and holds up so well throughout the day, I think itu2019s worth the splurge. Also, it comes in so many color options so thereu2019s a good match for just about everyone. Please note that it is fragranced, for those who are sensitive."

It will be great in the summer when I have more of a tan, so I will keep it but will have to buy a true pink instead.

The pigmentation is buildable but even with a heavy hand, doesn't look cakey or powdery.

The formula hasn't changed since the original shades were released; it's a silky smooth pressed powder that blends effortlessly and never looks dry or chalky.  True Pink is a classic bubblegum shade with a strong cool undertone, buildable pigmentation and a satin finish without any glitter, shimmer or sparkle. I love that it gives a natural flush and healthy glow to my vampire pale skintone but this shade will suit others as well.  **True Pink is a color dupe for Dior's Rosy Glow blush in Pink but the recent reformulation is terrible so I would definitely recommend buying this instead."

It is a buildable blush that looks gorgeous on my light skin tone.  I love that you can use the blush on the eyes and well as the cheeks for those need to get out the door quick makeup looks. I did find that the blush lasted longer on the cheeks with the use of face primer and setting spray. It wore well after 6 hours with a little fading and I already have received compliments while wearing it. If you donu2019t own any of the Gucci blushes I highly suggest to add at least one to your blush collection. So far I own 3 shades."

The only con I can think of really is how small the product is by volume compared to the price (it's around the size of a mini blush) but that tends to be the case with luxury brands so not a surprise. it is also scented which i know isn't preferred for some - I'm usually not a fan of fragrance in makeup myself, but the gucci scent is heavenly imo so I don't mind it at all, but something to note if you're sensitive to scented makeup."

I got it because I was on the hunt for a replacement for my favorite blush that was discontinued. The formula is very nice, and it diffuses easily. The color is a nice warm medium pink that works for my medium olive skin tone, but I'm not sure it would work for anyone darker than that because as I apply more layers, it develops a pearly finish that can start to look chalky. My other major gripe is that the packaging doesn't feel luxe at all, and at this price point, that's unacceptable. It's mostly plastic and quite bulky, and the clasp doesn't actually close properly so it's only a matter of time before it breaks. Blush is my favorite makeup item so I've tried a lot of them and I'm not afraid to spend on a good product, so trust me when I say that once you cut past all the hype, this product is just okay and you can definitely find cheaper and better. I wouldn't repurchase or recommend."

I've tried tons of brushes and keep getting the same result. IMO, if you're looking for a product similar but easier to work with, pick up Pat McGrath Fleurtatious.

I thought it would be too light of a color for some reason, but itu2019s such a lovely color. I like using it with a big fluffy blush or a fan brush on the cheeks. I find itu2019s better to use fingers on the eyes to get it more pigmented but it does help add a touch of monochromatic vibes on the crease - doesnu2019t have to be the main event on my eyes Super buildable not super sheer, and not super dry or opaque. Also buttery soft, so sad I lost it bc itu2019s super sold out"

I am a person that has always had a lot of redness and pinkness in my skin. Especially my cheeks. So while I don't use blush every day, I have tried quite a few different ones. Not only does this warm berry color look wonderful on a lot of different skin tones, it glides on smoothly, blends out easily, and lasts quite a while. My favorite part is that it is not only safe but recommended to use as eye shadow as well. The color really works for both. Its wonderfully pigmented, blends easily, it lasts a while, etc. I would 1,000% recommend it."

Let me also mention that this blush is lightly scented, it has a nice clean floral smell that does wear off after a while. So no lingering scent.

But, what about the actual quality and performance of the blush? Here's my honest and authentic opinion as a Sephora Beauty Insider Community Ambassador after having it be my go-to blush for the past 5 days.   WHAT I LIKE:  * Soft, silky texture* Buttery smooth application  * Blends easily  * Buildable coverage  * Beautiful packaging  * Good lasting power - the color stayed on my face, with minimal fading or transfer, for about 7, sometimes 8, hours on most days.   AREA(S) FOR IMPROVEMENT:  * The shades in this initial release offered a nice variety for my fair-to-light complexion, but it would be great to see the shade range expand to include colors deeper than 06 Warm Berry (which, by the way, is gorgeous!). * I had some difficulty opening the compact and was afraid I'd dig my fingernail into the product when I did. It'll take some getting used to, for me, at least.  FYI / ADDITIONAL THOUGHTS: * 05 Rosy Beige (sometimes called Rosy Tan) is a neutral-to-neutral-warm dusty-rose/mauve brown shade.  * I found the finish of this blush to be more on the satin side - it's not matte nor luminous, despite its name. Looks natural on my skin; no shimmer or glitter particles. * Has a noticeable floral scent; I don't mind it and it does fade away, but those sensitive to fragrance, and especially to floral scents, might want to pass on these blushes.  BUY, BUY, BUY or BYE-BYE?  * I'm happy I picked up this blush and there are a couple of other shades that have caught my eye. That said, this isn't a must have but a nice-to-have item, especially if you like Gucci Beauty or luxury beauty products."

I not only used this on my cheeks to bring some natural glow to my face, but also applied this blush on my eyes. I love how versatile this product can be used and that it has a luminous matte finish. There were no issues with this blush breaking apart or any fall out product left behind. This blush is so lightweight feeling. The packaging is absolutely top end gorgeous. You can tell right away when opening the box that this blush is no joke. I looked up the price of this blush and I would most definitely purchase this in the future, now that I've had the opportunity to try it. The locking mechanism works great and does not open up while it is in my cosmetic bag. My skin type is a combination of dry and oily. I also like how they incorporated three amazing ingredients. Hyaluronic acid, shea butter and black rose oil. All three ingredients give the benefits that my skin needs when using this blush. I would highly recommend buying Gucci blush."

It didnu2019t look cakey, it was smooth and blendable, and a perfect color for fall! I worked a full shift at work and have worn it for over 12 hours and it is still as vibrant as when I first applied it! My only complaint is that it does seem a little tricky to open, but it could be user error..the product is also scented so if you are sensitive to fragrance you might now like this product. I personally really like the scent, it smells like a fruity floral perfume. Overall it is  a wonderful blush and Iu2019m happy to have it in my collection."

The front is fun and flirty with a pink base and gold stars...but the compact only opens to a 90 degree. Because it is so small it's hard to actually use the mirror at this angle. The compact either needs to be bigger for a larger mirror, or it needs to be able to open farther back. I hope this makes sense...because for whatever reason it absolutely irritates me."

I is a luminous matte which is also blurring on the skin but with a more natural finish. I cannot put them down. I put on bate skin to try the color and I'd wear these without a foundations for sure.  the fact that they look gorgeous on the eyes for a monochromatic look, chefs kiss*.

For me blush is a must! Even on my most basic makeup days I have to have blush, otherwise I look plain and death lol (I blame it on my beige undertone skin color) This rose beige tone is perfect for light medium skin tones. Tbh, at first the color looked a little to deep for me, but itu2019s not! once applied it melts into your skin so beautiful and effortless that looks like your natural color peeking through. Plus, this is labeled as a cheeks and EYES product, so I gave it a test and -even though I have super oily eyelids- it looks so beautiful and it holds in place all day long. This is a winner for oily skins. Given the price, I think itu2019s perfect you can use it for more than just blush and it comes handy when youu2019re on the go or want to create a monochromatic look. Perfect to carry it with you everyday everywhere.  Thanks Influenster and Sephora for such a wonderful treat."

I only have one Quam about the blush is there is a very strong flowery floral perfume scent and I absolutely do not like that smell I donu2019t know why they would put a perfume scent inside of something youu2019re going to put on your face close to your nose mouth and eyes other than that I love this product  I received these products free from influencer and brand(s) in exchange for my honest review."

This goes on great with a brush or a blender, has the slightest hint of apricot scent, and is non-irritating and long-lasting! The hyaluronic acid keeps it from drying you out while making it creamy on application without drying cakey. So glad to have this as a fixture in my makeup bag!"

It was so hard to narrow down the colors I wanted because even though my Sephora had them they were not out on the gondola yet. I decided between warm berry and sweet peach and did a buy online pick up in store. Warm berry is the perfect shade for a Fall or Winter look. It applies a lot lighter than what you see in the pan but still has a gorgeous rich berry tone to it.  The packaging to open the blush can be tricky. Sometimes I found it easier to open then other times. It is pricey for the amount you get but if you can get it during a sale I would pick it up right away."

Lets hope this time all goes well that way I don't have to try to remember every exact word I wrote for a third time around! Lol I want to say first off this is one of the first times I've used a blush on my lids and didn't feel like the chalky powder formula of it completely stripped them of all their moisture. That inturn created God awful creasing, which this didn't at all. This silky, smooth formula smoothed across my lids seamlessly, and this color I received is great for the upcoming season of fall. Like clothes this time of year, you can layer this up, and down as well depending on your complexion, and ability to coordinate. I also had worn this on the apples of my cheeks and used a fluffy brush and blended it out towards my temples, and when I tell you don't knock it till you try it, I'm serious because at first glance after I had put a light sweep onto my apples I thought to myself oh man, what the heck am I gonna be able to do with this stuff her e? This is not a good color for me at all. I didn't want to except that I had to really get on my favorite sites and write bad reviews on a good product due to a color mishaps, so I decided to just go ahead and get out my brushes and go to work softening it out, and once I did I tell you I am so glad that I didn't just leave it at that and be done cause if I would've, I would've missed out on a really great product that's multipurpose, and great feelin on my skin. Thank you so much for reading my review and I hope that this helps someone who's just not too sure to close their eyes and just make the leap. Trust me, you'll not regret it. Looking forward for more products to review so look for reviews as I get some more products coming in. Xoxos"

            "review_text": "I received this product free from Influenster and Gucci for my honest review. And the truth is that Gucci gave us a blush in a covetable compact thatu2019s so pretty itu2019ll make you want to take it everywhere with you. And thatu2019s the idea. The compact itself has a good weight to it and does not look or feel cheap. Gucci did it right with the materials they chose for the product.   I got to try out Tender Apricot 02 which is such a beautiful peachy color. The coverage is light but buildable; both translucent and pigmented. On the days you might want just a flush of color, itu2019s not a blush youu2019ll have to heavily blot after to get some of that pigment off. It has a beautiful velvety, smooth texture. Itu2019s great for creating a number of different looks and they encourage you to use elsewhere on your face. The peachy color did wonders on my eyes when I used it. Just a little bit on my lids and it brightened up my eyes.  Itu2019s definitely a versatile compact thatu2019s perfect for stashing in your bag (day/night) for little touch ups. The small size makes it perfect for evening bags.   Final verdict: this is the compact Iu2019ll be bringing with me for my long summer nights out in Greece. Not only is she pretty and worthy of my Euro travels, but she works well, too. Win, win!"

It's a sweet pink shade called radiant pink. At first I thought it would be too light for my skin but it's the perfect shade for daytime with one quick brush or fun Barbie pink for evening with a couple brushes.  I put a little on my lids and cheeks after a base of tinted sunscreen and headed out to do my errands. It feel light and adds the ideal amount of shading for a casual daytime look."
