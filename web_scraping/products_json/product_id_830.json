This lip/cheek stain made my lips feel moisturized and did not seem to dry my lips out after it wore off. I don't consider it to be a true lip stain. It lasted 2+ hours without eating, drinking, or talking. About 3.5 hours after applying the lip stain and after eating and drinking, my lips were very subtly tinted (mostly along the perimeter). Not terrible. However, $25 for a 0.17 oz bottle is not budget-friendly for everyday use."

            "review_text": "I just want to preface this review by saying the product is cute and there are no horrible defects or problems with it.   I ordered the Peach color of this product and while it was smaller than anticipated, it was still cute, I liked the packaging. That being said based on my experience and some of the other reviews the color you buy means nothing because after the product sits on your lips for a little while they all turn about the same shade. When I applied this product it started out as the lovely peach shade that I was aiming for but within one or two minutes it became a sort of generic deep pink/ berry color; still very pretty, but not what I really wanted.   Wiping the product off to see the stain, I was also disappointed. My lips looked pretty much the same as whenever I wipe other lip products off my lips-- so the stain was minimal at best.  Using the product as a blush was a bit tricky as well. The formula is very watery and sheer so I had to really work at applying a few layers to achieve a non-patchy and visible blush. It's pretty once you get there but I was hoping for a more seamless application and payoff.  Lastly, the packaging, as I mentioned before very cute. The actual tube of the product is set in a silicone base giving it a bit of charm and protection. Receiving the product brand new-- the silicone has a nice slightly glassy finish. The bottle fell on my floor and instinctively washed the container and unfortunately the silicone does not hold up well to regular soap and water. The gloss is gone, the silicone looks perpetually scuffed even though it isn't, making the product look months older than it really is.   All of these small things combined, I would not purchase any of the other colors, but I will finish this one off because it's still a fine lip product formulation, it was just disappointing on a few of its selling points."

Unfortunately most lip stains dry out my lips/stain weird. I have super dry lips so I know what is going turn my mouth into a raisin right when I put it on. Finally tried these and they r amazing! These r the most comfortable stains ever! and stains my lips well/last long. At first I was turned off by the package, but now I love how compact and cute it is! Easy to travel and have multiple. If I want a deeper stain I apply twice while drying in between. If I want to be natural just one layer. I usually get them from kaja, but glad that Sephora carries them. I'll be buying these forever bc it's the the best stain product I've found so far. Highly recommend!!!"

Plus, thereu2019s a fun glittery heart attached to it which I like messing with. It has a nice, sweet smell to it but isnu2019t overly strong so itu2019s not overwhelming. Iu2019d say it smells less like candy sweet and more like perfume? I was a little worried because I like more subtle colors, but this one is perfect. Just looking at the color doesnu2019t really do it justice. Itu2019s a very light color that gives your lips a pinkish coloring with a nice glossy shine. It doesnu2019t feel heavy or sticky at all. I would definitely recommend this color specifically if you are looking for a subtle look. The only thing is that iu2019m not a huge fan of the material used for the bottom part of the bottle. That is just personal preference though and really doesnu2019t affect the product at all."

The shade looked little lighter on lips as compared to when applied to skin. When applied to cheeks it gives a natural look that I really like. But it's a little sticky for cheeks.

            "review_text": "I was gifted by kajabeauty the Kaja Jelly Charm Lip & Blush Glazed Keychain Stain in the color Mocha Glazed. This color is like a very light brown and can be built up to get a darker stain. It applies so smooth and doesn't leave any sticky feeling. It has a semi shine, but once completely dry, it has that perfect amount of glow finish to give a hydrated look to the lips and cheeks. I do not wipe it off after applying it, instead I just let it wear off by itself and it's perfect. I thought the brown color would not look good on cheeks but I was wrong! It gives it enough color to look natural and give a bit of a flush look. After it's worn off, it leaves your lips feeling so smooth and soft, it's almost as if I had applied lip balm plus leaves that bit of stain giving the lips a natural flush of color. It has all natural ingredients and I'm thinking the squalene is what gives us that hydration. I love the keychain it comes with because it gives it a pop of color and you can easily attach this to your purse, bookbag, or carry it with your keys. My Personal favorite is having it on the strap of my bag. It's the perfect size to carry with you. I will say it comes at a hefty price point for the amount of product you get but since it's vegan and has so many natural ingredients, I think it's worth it."

Overall the product performs as expected. The color was a bit more red upon dry down than I would have liked however it is still a pretty shade, I would just have preferred the shade stay more of the initial brown tone it has when it is glossy.   Upon application the product has a nice serum feel almost, not too oily and not sticky at all. It does dry down but does not give a tight dry feeling like some stains can.  The scent is very light and fruity. Inoffensive to most Iu2019m sure.  Personally I think the keychain cheapens the look of the product and is completely unnecessary."

The formula glides on smoothly and leaves a natural, radiant finish on both lips and cheeks. The pigment is rich, yet buildable, ensuring you can control the intensity of your look from subtly sun-kissed to vibrant and bold. Despite its long-lasting formula, it feels incredibly light, almost like wearing nothing. Its cute packaging is a bonus, making it not just a beauty product, but a stylish accessory. However, I do wish it came in a wider range of shades. Overall, itu2019s a must-have in your makeup arsenal!"

The formula is lightweight and comfortable on, no stickiness, jelly-like that leaves a beautiful pop of color. If you like more pigmented lip stains this might not be for you, but the color is buildable. This will stay on my lips for about 2-3 hours and then it needs touch-up. When applied on the cheeks, it leaves a beautiful healty flush of color.

To be honest, the packaging was the reason I requested to test this product. The little keychain is absolutely adorable. I've been a fan of K-beauty jelly lip stains for ages so I was trusting Kaja to do a good job because Kaja was created in collaboration with one of my favorite K-Beauty brands. These do the job of a jelly stain as expected, though I will say that they are more of a gloss in the way that I use mine as the stain is not super long lasting. I have better luck with wear time on my cheeks where this product makes such a pretty luminous blush when tapped on with fingers!   I really enjoy this product and will keep using it, another win for Kaja in my book!"

I tested the jelly charm lip and blush glazed keychain stain in the color peach fizz. This is a beautiful color and I love that it is lightweight and sheer . You can apply more than one layer to get a full Glam look or a monochromatic look. I applied this blusher directly on my cheekbones and applied using my fingers. It is a Rose color on my olive neutral skin! I also applied a small amount on my lips after exfoliating with my lip scrub. I am in love with the color and the texture. The texture is very silky and soft. The ingredients are skin loving including Triple berry complex to protect your skin. Lemon fruit extract is moisturizing and helps to brighten skin.  Olive squalene is one of my favorite ingredients for more moisture and provides antioxidants. The packaging for this cheek and lip stain is so adorable! I love the keychain that comes with this product. It is very glamorous and something that I would have loved when I was younger too! The amount is a bit smaller than what I thought it was going to be but this product will still last me months or more. I think for the overall quality that the price is affordable.  This versatile product comes in 6 different shades! I think I'm going to try the Cherry next or the guava. This product is available to purchase at Sephora and at kajabeauty.com. you can attach the keychain to your purse, book bag or in your pocket wherever your preference is. I highly recommend this product to anyone looking for a buildable stain and the packaging alone is so pretty that I would order it just for that again!"

It goes away quickly, but I'd rather it didn't have taste at all. I didn't end up using it as a blush much since it looks kind of patchy on my cheeks, but as a lip product I think it's ok. The key chain is a cute touch too, it's unfortunate that it has this weird bitter taste, otherwise I'd use this product more often. Gifted by kajabeauty in exchange for an honest review."

On my lips it stays comfortable even after drying or wearing off and the wear itself is even. No patches or spots peeling off like some stains. And its SO easy to get a soft focus look too.

When I leave this lip stain as a gloss, it looks like I bit into a fresh berry, it really gives that juicy/wet effect to my lips that I love (the shade is also very pretty). It's very comfortable to wear and didn't feel sticky. It did stay put after I drank water several times and didn't stain my water bottle (I was surprised) but, besides that, it came off pretty quickly. The stain it leaves is mostly around the center of my lips and I wish it was more pigmented. I didn't really care for it as a blush because it's tacky and slippery, and moves everything underneath around. I think the price is steep for it when there are bigger sized lip oil out there that are cheaper or about the same price. This one is tiny!"

The product feels almost silky on your skin, and you can either use a brush or your fingers to gently blend. It's hard to overdo these, and as such you may find you want to build for intense color (I used two layers in the photo, applied as blush only). Admittedly this makes it hard for me to gauge if these will show up as much on deeper skin tones, so that is something to keep in mind.  I'll likely end up purchasing more, as I love the formula and the addition of the keychain is just so cute!"

It has a strange sort of sticky feel at first but once blended out (I use my finger but you could probably use a beauty blender) it leaves skin smooth and soft. The pigment is perfect! You can build it up or sheer it out. On the lips it's beautiful for a natural look of built up for a full lip color. I will def purchase other colors!! Gifted by Kaja but opinions are mine."

Iu2019m very familiar with the formula as a lot of other Korean makeup brands have similar products, but I think this is a bit more unique among the Western market. This feels like a liquid version of a glowy lip balm that leaves behind a light stain when wiped away. This has a light fruity scent that disappears after a few minutes. Depending on the shade, this leaves behind a stain when wiped off (my shade left a very faint stain, but a darker color may provide different results). The packaging is A+ and is super cute, especially with the key chain. I love that itu2019s portable and small enough to carry around easily. Overall, I think this is perfect for those who donu2019t like to fuss around too much with their lip makeup, but would still like something that looks like one put in some effort to look good."

Upon receiving it, I didnu2019t feel anything in particular. Maybe I felt a little excitement because I did want the lip stain so bad. I have a light/medium skin tone and I chose peach fizz and I think itu2019s super flattering on my skin tone. Itu2019s a beautiful glossy, semi-thick formula. It goes on well and it layers well. Itu2019s small and can go anywhere you go as long as you take your keys with you. You can hook it up to your lanyard, keys, backpack, etc. I genuinely enjoy the formula and it does bring color to my cheeks as well. Itu2019s a nice, soft, dewy look. I knocked off a star because considering other lip stain keychains Iu2019ve bought, itu2019s super tiny. However, I added a star back because that formula is gorgeous and it fades so beautifully."

Perhaps others may like it, but it was very middle school, beginners makeup. I selected this because of the ingredients and I expected more of a color payoff and a glossy feel, but it was a little sticky and although the smell is light, it wasnu2019t desirable. The product did wipe away easily and I get see how some people may think this is moisturizing. Worth a try though! For a keychain, itu2019s cute and would do in a pinch. So sorry for the poor review."

The keychain is adorable and it gives me childhood nostalgia, but it's kind of bulky for a lip gloss. I can't see me realistically keeping the keychain attached. The color wasn't quite what I thought it would be, which was disappointing, and the bottle is REALLY small. That being said, I LOVED the formula and try as I might, I couldn't find any chemical or lipstick-y smell to it. The bottle seals tightly and the doe's foot does a great job at evenly dispersing the color. I would definitely buy these if they were on sale. Gifted by Kaja."

The charm with the glitter and hearts inside reminds me of a snow globe and is so fun to watch and play with.  The product itself glides on with the doe foot applicator.  It feels nice on my lips and is not sticky.  It gives just a little bit of tint and is pretty neutral.  It makes a nice light blush on my cheeks as well. The color is somewhat buildable but stays pretty sheer overall.  I wish the color lasted a little longer on my lips.  I feel like it wears off pretty quickly.  And, I wish it would dry faster on my cheeks.  It transfers easily because it takes so long to dry.  It stained my cheeks and was hard to completely remove with cleanser. I just prefer to use it on my lips.  It contains olive squalane to help with moisture.  It is vegan, cruelty free and made with clean ingredients.

            "review_text": "Really cute lippie but the bottle is super tiny, it's the size of an average keychain. It even comes with its own keychain which is adorable. The sparkly heart is squishy and I like to fiddle with it if I'm nervous or need to get my mind off of something. The color Peach Fizz is a nice everyday pinky-peach that looks like your lips but better, and it leaves behind a very subtle stain so there's still some color left even if the glossy part rubs off. The formula is runny and doesn't last long on the lips, maybe one-two hours tops. I also tried using it on the cheeks as a blush and it works fine with minimal makeup looks. I don't think it will work over thick foundation because the formula needs to adhere to your actual skin (the tint, too) but if you normally do tinted moisturizer or no foundation at all, this can work just fine as a blush. // gifted by Kaja"

And when I tell you it stains I mean it. I put on the lip stain and then I went to brush my teeth, and my whole lips got all wet but the stain stayed on my lips! I was so impressed that the stain actually lasts on my dry lips! Usually these kind of products dry out my lips, but this doesnu2019t do it, it feels so comfortable and juicy on the lips!

I'm using it every day in combination with my favorite neutral lip liner, I softly smudge it and then I apply the kaja lip stain on top. The perfect lip combo, I received many compliments and questions about what product I was wearing. Only down side is that doesn't last very long time, so you need to reapply it few times during the day. Last but not least, the packaging is super cute, especially the keychain, so so pretty!!

It doesnu2019t pill or clump, which I appreciate, but I do believe there are better options for a quality lip/cheek stain available."

They are not at all dry and patchy like most stains.  no it doesn't stay on for a super long time, but id rather reapply this than use some crusty stain that clings to every dry patch on my lips.  they did such a good job with the shades, literally like you rubbed a Popsicle on your lips.  Cherry spritz, available at Kaja only, go get it."
