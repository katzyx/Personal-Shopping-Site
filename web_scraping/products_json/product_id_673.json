I tried it in the store, and at first, I didn't like it, but as it settled in, I loved it. I ended up leaving the store with it."

I put this on in the morning and Iu2019m transported on a delicate French cloud to a corner bistro where the wine flows like beer and the fashionistas flock like the salmon of Capistrano. A beret pops out of my hair and my high school French starts to sound like Iu2019m Chanel herself. I will never wear anything else again.   All of this is intense hyperbole, I know, but I really canu2019t get over how much I love this stuff. Itu2019s truly the best."
