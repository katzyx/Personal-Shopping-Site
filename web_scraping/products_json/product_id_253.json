But, when I opened it I was hesitant that I was not going to like it because Iu2019m not a huge floral scent person. But to my surprise I was able to handle this perfume because it was not overpowering. When you first put on the perfume (I had a roll on) it smells like fresh cut roses, but shortly after it turned into a sweeter, light rose scent. As the time went on the fresh cut smell of roses died down and I was able to enjoy the perfume. I had other people around me compliment the scent, which I found interesting because not a lot of people are fans of floral perfumes. I also found that the scent lasted for most of the day, but again, I had a roll on version so Iu2019m not sure if the spray bottle would last longer or shorter than the roll on? The free, small sample I received lasted me quite a while. I used it everyday (around my wrists and behind the ears) from the day I got it up until now, which was about 1.5-2 months. I do think getting a small sample size would be better for someone wanting to try it out to see if they like it because again, floral, rose scents are not for everyone."

The only problem is that since itu2019s EDT it does not last long. It only last an hour but the roller ball makes reapplication easy, which is a plus.

I like the scent of roses, but you must love the scent of roses to love this perfume; the rose note is almost overwhelming to me - so much so that I I have a difficult time detecting the notes that are at the heart of what I love about Chloe. After a couple of hours, it settles to a lovely, soft fragrance that I truly enjoy, but those opening notes are strong! This perfume is better suited to spring and summer, so perhaps I will like it more if I try it again when it warms up. If you adore roses, this is the scent for you."

At first I was disappointed in how long it lasted but then I tried using a little more and you could smell it all day. I think itu2019s great for every day wear.

I put a little bit on my wrists at around 10 am and when I got back from a day of running around doing errands at 6pm, it was still very strong, which I see as a good thing!

The scent is strong, you donu2019t need much as a tiny bit goes a long way!  And I usually bath myself in fragrances lol. The initial note is ROSES, exact smell of roses. BUT, as it dries down you start sensing the mid a lower notes that are very clean, fresh a flirty. I had my husband take a whiff and he loved it too. I asked him if he cared that I wear this more often and he said definitely. Iu2019m not gonna lie, Iu2019ll be purchasing this fragrance again in the future, after I finish the travel size. This is a lasting fragrance, for the entire day, but not too strong where it doesnu2019t wash out of clothing and fades away by the next day.

It really smells like roses - not the sickly sweet artificial kind of smell at all, but true roses: delicate, varied and soft but not powdery - like taking a sniff of a fresh bouquet of roses. The scent has some lasting power, though it is an Eau de toilette so it won't last all day, but with this convenient rollerball travel format I've been able to reapply as much as I want! Even on hot active days I've only needed to the once though. It's also a great quality rollerball, well made, I have used some not-so-great ones and this one has been consistent since I bought it in 2016. I am pleasantly surprised that the smell has remained the same until now in 2020, so the slow exposure to air as I've used it (it's still a third full) hasn't affected it any. Excellent product, would recommend, and will buy again!"

I get the rose, but there's an undertone of something lighter that reminds me of Marc Jacobs Daisy (which I don't care for).  I guess that's the bergamot?  And the staying power isn't great.  I applied it less than an hour ago and it's already mostly faded.  The rose is almost all gone, but the undertones are still there.  I'll use this, but keep looking for my perfect rose perfume."

I am giving this perfume a 5 star rating for its fragrance only.  I typically give my wrist a small spritz as well my neck.  Iu2019m very picky about my choices when it comes to perfume, something that is not musky or way too flowery and this fits the flattery perfect.  As it reads on the card that accompanied the sample u201ca rare simplicity and eternal grace, A light natural Dew Drop Trail where notes of Rose absolute blend with a voluptuous Magnola accordu201d.  The downside to the fragrance is that is it very strong, a bit overwhelmingly strong.  It would have been better placed somewhere closer to my feet than my throat because after 4 hours as I type this I can still taste the blend as if I just spritz it.  I am to be convinced that everyone in my building knows I am currently here today. If that is something you do not mind then by all means u2026u2026 spritz away but if it is not then use very sparingly because a little goes a very long way.  I will try Chloe again on another day just by giving a little spritz on the wrist but nothing more.  If I am not overwhelmed by the application on that day I would not be opposed to purchase this myself for daily use."

I mean it, this perfume was like a drug to me! I couldn't get enough!  After MUCH searching I was able to find it and have worn it everyday since. This is the ultimate girly scent without being overpowering. I find it is the perfect scent for someone looking for a feminine scent that doesn't smell too mature or young. On my body I find the light flowery hints wear over the day until they are mixed beautifully with a almost vanilla spice-like undertone.   The absolute only complaint I have (which contributes to the 4/5 rather than 5/5 rating) is that I find it wears much more on warmer days where I'm sweating more. Around mid afternoon I am ready to reapply. That being said I have less of an issue during the Fall/Winter months.   After almost 2 years, I still find myself sitting at my desk sniffing at my wrist every so often because I just can't get enough of this scent! So happy to have found my perfect signature fragrance."

I'm not normally a fan of floral fragrances but this is different somehow.  It's a very light, fresh rose scent.  More like picking up a hint of rose in the breeze rather than face-planting in a bouquet of sugar-coated roses.  Mom and I both highly recommend."

The scent is definitely of roses so if you're looking for a true soft rose scent you've found it. It's also quite soft but still noticeable and has the most amazing staying power. I apply this in the morning and can still smell it at the end of the night without needing a touch up in between. I haven't found a single fragrance yet with that type of staying power. I also want to mention that I don't care what a bottle looks like, I only care about the scent itself but if you do care than this bottle is quite lovely and oh so feminine like the scent itself. It really it pretty sitting on my dresser. I also own the travel size, rollerball, it will come in handy when I don't want to risk my beautiful bottle for a weekend away."

I had my husband sniff me after having this on for maybe 30 minutes and he loved it. He said he preferred it over my signature scent which he happened to love so that's saying something. Years ago I had bought Joy perfume, the pure very expensive perfume that's nothing but pure roses and while it had a beautiful scent I ended up returning it because I couldn't smell it on myself after maybe 1 hour at the most, and the price was over $200 25 yrs ago. I wish this was at least a parfume but it does have much more staying power than I would have expected, I could still smell it quite a few hours (maybe 8 or so?) after applying. All in all I'm very pleased with my purchase and will now own the rollerball for my purse and the bottle for home. If you're looking for a true rose scent I couldn't recommend this enough!"

I didn't really pay attention to this variant because I was really into the original chloe and the love story. Until recently spring time finally came and i was looking for a new fragrance that will remind me of the fresh spring scent every time I use it. I sprayed the roses de chloe on the paper strip and oh boy it smelled like a plain rose water. It didn't excite me so I totally forgot about it. The next time I went to Sephora I sprayed it on my wrist. I dunno why I but it was totally different on the skin vs. the paper strip. On my skin it smelled like the most beautiful enchanting and freshest rose scent ever! It smelled so delicate and so feminine. The scent will transport you to a garden of roses in a clear crisp spring morning while touching the morning dew. It just blew me away. I didn't buy it right away because i wanted to test the silage and how it smells after a few hours. This scent didn't last the whole day fyi because the scent is really soft and mild. However I cannot forget this perfume that I went ahead and bought it anyway. Plus, most long lasting perfumes are those that are musky and strong, and the head ache trigger scents which I avoid especially in the spring and summer months. So I don't really mind if it doesn't last on me the whole day because I get to do a couple more spritz every time. I got the spray bottle and rollerball for touch ups during the day. And I am so happy I did. This perfume is the best perfume in my collection so far due to the fact that it puts me in a happy mood every time I use it. That's when you know you found your all time signature scent!!! Please don't ever discontinue this Chloe!"

I opened it hopeful it was as nice of smell as they said it was.  On smell I will say I did like it. It's fresher than granny's scent of old. It goes on with a fresh roses scent. Smells pretty good...but, after 1 hour..there is absolutely no smell on me.  I honestly have bought $5 knockoff perfume that last longer than this.  Seriously, no smell left on coat, clothes or self. Maybe it's my chemistry but nothing. So for $70, even though it was sentimental because my husband and daughter smelled quite a few fragrances before picking this one first for my Christmas present, I must return it..hoping they take the opened bottle with package and receipt back.

Thankfully I did because I'm completely obsessed! It is a classic rose scent that sands out from the complimentray hints of Bergamot and white musk. My roommate even told me that she loves how it smells when I spray it and that you can still smell it lightly on me later in the day. If you love fresh floral fragrances give this a go!"

The rose smells like my grandma's garden after a rain and not like a funeral parlor as so many rose scents do to me.  The amber in the drydown makes this smell sophisticated and a little sexy.   I'd say this is closer to a skin scent after the first hour or so which is how I like my perfume. I am not a fan of fragrance announcing itself to the public or leaving a vapor trail so if you want monster sillage this is not for you.   The scent lasted a!! day on me."

'old' kind of powdery grandma scent to them). That said, this scent does not bring to mind any of those hilarious (yet torturous) memories. Instead, it reminds me of the first time my SO brought me home roses, and romantic memories of the like.  What I loved most about this product, was while I LOVED it straight out of the bottle and on a piece of paper just to smell. On my skin it was a whole new experience. The scent intensified! It was bolder, yet still subtle/light enough that it wasn't overwhelming to be near me even when I sprayed myself more than what I would normally wear. The best part, it lasted a good 8 hours at least! (heck, I even smelled some on me the following morning when I woke up).  It is pricey, I'll admit I choked on whatever beverage I was drinking when I saw the price. However, for how long it lasts and the beautiful scent it has on my skin, I am willing to spurge a little for a good quality perfume. I don't have many perfumes anyways, and this is my first floral scent, too! I'm very pleased!"

I am a huge fan and it's not overpowering as I thought it might be & after a long night out or long day at work or school, the scent manages to stick without having to reapply like I do with Daisy. I've gotten many compliments from wearing this perfume & I'm such a huge fan. I would describe the smell as graceful, with a hint of carefree and sophisticated.

So I sprayed this on one wrist, went out, and spent the night before smelling it again. Let me rephrase that, I ended up smelling my wrist the entire night! The subtle yet rosy scent is perfect for someone like me who wants a perfume that smells natural with a hint of comforting floral scent. It almost smells like laundry smell due to the fact that it is not overpowering nor too distinct.   The only thing is that I have to keep reapplying every couple of hours, which sucks because even though I smell it, other people probably don't smell it as easily after a while.  Overall though, one of the best perfume I have ever smelled/gotten!"

But within seconds, it disappeared and turned into a strong soapy smell that I just can't stand (and it made my head ache). It seems like this is a favourite with many people, but it just doesn't work with my body chemistry at all.  It's a shame, because I really love roses and the initial note is something that I love, but it changes into something that really doesn't agree with me."

I asked for a sample (I really didn't need to spend on a perfume when I have other ones at home I barely use) and found myself spraying some on every day. SOLD!  Keep in mind this is an Eau de Toilette, which is only supposed to last around 4 hrs, compared to Eau de Parfum, which lasts 8hrs. Some days I spray it onto my skin, other days I spray in onto my clothes and it definitely lasts longer on fabric, so if you do want the smell to linger, I would suggest spraying it to your clothes! I love the smell of roses, it's very delicate and appropriate for winter and summer, day and night! I use this every day and now my other perfumes are further neglected ;) I will repurchase!"

All in all, I would definitely recommend trying this if you're a rose/floral fan!"

I tried the Daisy Eau so Fresh, was nice at first but oh God it got way too sweet, I can only imagine that as 5 year girls play toy perfume. The Chloe Rose starts off fresh, young and naturally sweet(doesn't feel synthetic), then it gradually shifts to a warmer rose scent. I do have Chloe EDP but Rose is just perfect to me~ I can sniff it for ages. For all other perfumes, I will sniff and take a breath because they are too synthetic, too strong, not so natural(can be headache-inducing).  It's one of the few high end beauty product I'd ever repurchase! Worth the $100. HG beauty product."

Pheromones and natural oils can significantly impact how your body takes on a scent, so in short, if a perfume doesn't smell good on you, it could be due to your composition, not due to a bad product. Its just like different makeups and face washes work better/worse for different people. For me, I thought the scent held well throughout the day, but then again, I don't exactly want to smell like I bathed in an ocean of perfume, so maybe people have different standards for how smelly they want to be. I always get the smallest bottle of perfume or try samples prior to purchasing, which is exactly what I did with Roses De Chloe and I absolutely fell in love. The one thing I will say is that the silver part of the bottle ended up tarnishing really bad."

It is just as lovely and floral, but with more depth.  That being said, I'm fairly disappointed that it doesn't come in an eau de parfum, just the eau de toilette, especially for the price. Maybe that's me being picky, but eau de toilette has more alcohol (usually to make it cheaper and more marketable, yet this is just as expensive as any standard perfume). That extra alcohol makes it so it doesn't smell as good right out of the bottle, then evaporates quicker and therefore doesn't last as long.  It's super lovely and I'll continue to wear it, I'm just wondering why it doesn't come in a true perfume?"

I wore the original Chloe for some time, and while I liked it, there was a certain intense -- almost laundry-like -- note that got to me. Roses de Chloe, however, is absolutely perfect.  It's light but still interesting. Very feminine. I can definitely smell the roses, but I am not usually a big rose fan. This perfume captures the essence of a very fresh, almost citrus-y rose, not necessarily a traditional, powdery rose.  A lot of reviewers are mentioning that the fragrance doesn't last too long on them. I actually notice the opposite! A spray on my wrists, neck, and hair is enough to last me all day, even though the fragrance is quite subtle...  Also, it doesn't hurt that my boyfriend really likes it...and he's gotten to be pretty picky, given that I test out perfumes so frequently!  I definitely recommend this fragrance if you're looking for something light, fresh, and a little floral. Certainly my new favorite! I don't foresee myself looking for a change of pace for some time."

Even on its own, this one is amazing. It is a very modern take on a classic rose fragrance. It is not your grandmother's rose perfume, but it's not so far out of the rose spectrum that it smells like rose chemicals the way other perfumes sometimes will. It's not powdery, just fresh and light and absolutely perfect. It's the one fragrance that my daughters and I can agree on. It is perfect for any age. Normally I rotate fragrances on a fairly regular basis, except for the original Chloe, which is the only perfume I have ever purchased more than twice. This one is my favorite of all time. It's not too strong, not too soft. It strikes a perfect balance. I have friends who are irritated by many perfumes, but this one does not bother them in the slightest. I don't know what Chloe did, but they have struck THE perfect balance in this one. If you like roses at all, you will love this fragrance. People say the scent doesn't last long, but what I find is that I don't smell it on myself after maybe 5-6 hours, but others still smell it up to at least 10 hours later, and I think that's a pretty decent amount of time for it to last."

I waited to try it... but when I decided to just go ahead and give it a try, after reading the reviews on here just because, I was shocked at how much I LOVE THIS!! I feel it is light, but that is a good thing. I think it is a very sophisticated blend, even though it is so airy and light. (I've noticed that many high-end perfumes get bad reviews on here if they are a more light, not so heady and/or strong smell, for some reason.)  Anyway, I love to spray this in my hair, I find it lasts longer that way and I get more whiffs of it myself to enjoy it. I also love to wear this to bed- HOW I WISH I COULD AFFORD THAT LUXURY EVERY NIGHT!! Especially since my sample has sadly run out and I must wait forever it feels to save up because this stuff is REALLY EXPENSIVE! I thought about taking off a star for the price, even though I'm well aware that great perfumes come at a great price but this specific brand and scent is just REALLY expensive! But in the end I decided that I love this scent so much that I'm totally willing to drop the cash (once I have it...)  To me, this soft, yet still fresh cut, beautiful rose brightened by Bergamot cannot be beat. I love Bergamot (Early Grey, and Lady Grey Teas) and to find it in a really great perfume was just awesome, and I do smell the lovely floral of Magnolia that feels like a fresh, yet sensual and carefree warm night. At first, the dry down on me confused me- it smelled like a sweet smoke, like a sweet tobacco and I felt concerned that I'd made a horrible mistake by spraying this on me and that a days' long migraine attack was about to strike, but SO luckily this did not happen! I still continued to get that warm, not overly smoky dry down, and it made me question if I liked this scent all the way through it's life-span on me. After wearing this to bed several nights because it just really calmed me down and helped me sleep (which is a horrible task for me) I smelled this blend unfold more and more and now I love that dry down. It is not powdery, I really hate anything powdery, but this still manages to be soft and clean and now I even crave that warm, soft, almost sweet tobacco scent."

I went in Sephora for a completely unrelated item but I always swatch perfumes and scents as soon as I arrive to the store to test their staying power while I browse other things. I kept reaching for the little paper that had this scent and every time I took a whiff of it, not only would it last was also intoxicating in the best way possible! When my hubby came to pick me up I made him smell the perfume lol and he absolutely loved it, he couldn't get enough of it and got it for me haha! So yeah ladies this perfume is awesome. Fantastic modern and vibrant roses scent, the throw is awesome as well since I have many people complementing me every time I wear this perfume and they always want to know the name of it. And lastly, it stays for a long time!! I wear this perfume all day and by night time I can still smell it in my hair and neck when I'm in bed! 5 stars for sure!  PS: The lady that was helping me at Sephora also recommended Rosabotanica and Rose The One by Dolce & Gabbanna and while they are all amazing, Chloe wins in the striking rose department. So if you are torn between those scents I'd go with Chloe all the way if rose is your thing."

This is a romantic yet very clean 21st-century rose - no powder and no thick, immature candy-sweetness. In my mind I picture a simple glass bud vase with a freshly-cut pink garden rose. The white musk and amber are like the vase itself and the bergamot and magnolia are the water inside, all of which lightly surround and support the pure rose scent. I think it's just heavenly! It's a subtle fragrance that will last through most of your workday, but you will definitely need to re-apply if you want it to last through the evening. If you prefer stronger, more complicated and noticeable perfumes, then Roses probably will not be your cup of tea."

If you're looking for something light and floral that doesn't smell like your grandma's house or the overpowering odor of a department fragrance stand, this is the one."

Imagine if you walked by a bouquet of roses that had just opened up completely and you got a hint of the soft fragrance with just a little sweet kick to it at the end. That's what this smells like. It's also very long lasting (9-5pm). Want it to last even longer? Then dot some vaseline on your pressure points then spritz the perfume on those spots: it'll last longer.

I received a sample from Sephora and feel in love at first sniff, which was shocking because Chloe's namesake perfume and See by Chloe are not my favorite scents. Those two actually triggered migraine symptoms the few occasions I tried to wear them. Roses de Chloe is much lighter than either scent mentioned and has an almost champagne like opening note. I love the bubbly, refreshing nature and how the roses emerge softly while retaining such a natural feel. This is definitely a girlie perfume; nothing edgy or heavy going on in this bottle. I can't give this 5 stars because of the price and the lack of staying power. Don't worry! The scent doesn't disappear in a couple of hours like many lighter perfumes but it isn't one that hangs around either. I'd recommend Roses de Chloe to anyone looking for a spring/summer fragrance that isn't cloyingly sweet or strong in other ways. Also, a rollerball or purse spray would be great!"

I sprayed this on at night and in the morning I smelled the powdery musk a little. I definitely do not smell any of the amber that is mentioned in the description. Stella by S. McCartney is rose balanced with amber, so it has a warmth to it while Roses de Chloe has more of a delicateness.  Somehow this does make itself known that it belongs to the Chloe wheelhouse, though. If you are a big Chloe fan you might appreciate it. If you are a rose fanatic, or don't have a rose scent already, this would be a nice choice. If you already have a rose scent, like me, this isn't worth the bother. I sampled it hoping that it would have something noticeably unique, but it didn't."

I've heard it described a soapy, but I didn't get that at all. There is a bit of magnolia, tarragon and amber that make the scent complex and interesting, but the main note of Damascus rose just shines through. My husband keeps burying his nose in my neck, it just smells so good. For reference: my favorite perfume is Stella by Stella McCartney (also Stella Sheer and Stella Nude) and I additionally wear Light Blue by Dolce & Gabbana and Daisy by Marc Jacobs to give you an idea of my preferences."

That was, until I found an ad for Roses de Chloe in a fashion mag, and, pleased with the sample on paper, decided to try it on my latest trip to Sephora. Having read your reviews first, I spritzed it on my wrist and decided to do my other shopping first before casting judgement. But I couldn't wait, because every time my arm would pass my face, I found myself intoxicated by the lovely scent of fresh cut roses lingering in the air. I was carrying a 1oz bottle in my basket by the time I left the store, and purchased it with no regrets. The scent is quite reminiscent of that of a fresh bouquet of roses, or a petal plucked straight off a rose, and not an overly-processed, fake odor attempting to replicate the scent of a rose, like a lot of other rose scented products I've encountered. This was a major selling point for me. My only qualm is that this scent is far more expensive than I am used to paying for perfume. I can buy a 3.4oz size of my usual scents for the prize of 1oz of Roses de Chloe. But so far, it appears it should be worth it."

It doesn't smell fruity or fresh but more of a classic rose perfume that my mom would wear. Its light, but lingers for hours.My mom actually had a perfume that smelled exactly like this when I was little so it just reminds me of her. :) Its definitely not an old grandma scent, but a classic rose.

It is an elegant soapy rose - like the kind of high quality soap I would put in my guest bathroom.  I am in love with this scent. I purchased the 2.5 oz bottle but wondered if that was too much. After putting the fragrance to the test for a few days now, I think I made the right choice. The down side is the stay power. I usually use 3-4 sprays in the morning. The fresh rose notes wares off in about 3 - 3.5 hours with the last musk and amber notes completely gone around 5 hours. I can get it to last a bit longer if I mist it on my clothing/hair versus the skin. With that said, the 2.5 oz works out perfectly for me when you factor in the extra application throughout the day.  Living in the south, a single hot summer can destroy a bottle of perfume. Thus, I keep my perfume collection in it's original box and in the last drawer of my fridge. Not sure if this is a most appropriate storage technique, but it has worked out so far."

The scent differs from the original but not by very much. Roses de Chloe has a heavier rose top note, (without the Lilly of the valley or freesia notes). Though the undertones of magnolia (found in both) soften the fragrance; making it smell, youthful, fresh, and spring like- and not at all like an old fashioned rose perfume. It's a beautiful fragrance. The only drawback is that being an eau de toilette, the perfume doesn't last as long as the eau de parfum- this can be helped by applying to hair and clothes, but it is still a short term solution. Hopefully (due to the apparent popularity) there will be a parfum version. Either way, the scent is beautiful, romantic, youthful, and keeps spring thoughts in my mind when constant reports of snow are reported."

This is a beautiful scent. Similar to Stella, but warmer because the lack of citrus. It's an EDT but I find the lasting power to be very good - just as good as Stella.

Love Chloe L'Eau too which is more aquatic than this. The roses here are young and pretty - definitely no grandma vibes here. As with the other Chloe scents, the bottle is gorgeous."

It's my go-to everyday perfume and I cannot get enough of it. Like some other reviewers mentioned, it doesn't really smell like any other perfumes - more just like a rose scented body mist. The staying power is, unfortunately, that of a body mist as well. I am still completely in love with the perfume and intend to buy more when I run out, but wish that it was just a bit longer lasting."

It smells so rosy and fresh, like what I imagine Paris to smell like in springtime. My only complaint is the lasting power :( I really do not prefer EDTs, especially when a fragrance is a light one like this. Considering that, the price seems very steep. I still may splurge though, and just carry it around with me everywhere!"

However, I soon realized after testing it, that it really gave that hint of freshness and the fresh smell of roses, but not just that. All the other scents mixed in with the perfume really compliment eachother in the best way possible.  The first day I wore this, one of my friends commented saying that I smelt really good. I was worried that when spritzed, it would be too strong and noticeable, but it gives a pleasant trace of aroma, where you can smell the amazing scent, but not to the point where it gives you a headache!  Really amazing perfume! I'm forever hooked into Rose de Chloe, and also wanting to try more products from the Chloe line!  AMAZING!"

It's not nearly as good as the original Chloe, which smells like a perfectly blended, recognizable perfume to me. My nose could mistake Roses de Chloe for a Crabtree & Evelyn body lotion, or a potpourri in a bowl on the piano. If it had just of a touch of the power in original Chloe it would be magnificent (and maybe this does come out on others' skin). I'm sure I'll buy this, because it is one of the best rose perfumes I've ever smelled. My review compares it, perhaps unfairly, to the original Chloe, which I adore. Fans of Chloe, Stella, Rosewater, Rose de Rosine and all the great new rose perfumes."

            "review_text": "Let me first start by saying that I have a pretty sensitive nose. I find lots of popular fragrances to be cloying and headache-inducing, so I am constantly on the hunt for a fresh, clean, pretty scent that won't give me a headache or make me feel nauseous while wearing.  And this is definitely it. I first received a sample of this from another retailer, and I was surprised how much I liked it--I'm usually not a fan of rose-y scents. But this one is crisp, clean, ultra-feminine, and just SO GOOD. I immediately jumped online and ordered the largest size bottle after smelling the sample!  This perfume is light enough to wear during the day, but also appropriate to wear on date nights too. It wears well, lasts, and I've received tons of compliments on it. It's not a youthful scent (fruity), but it isn't an old scent either (spicy/musky)--if you know what I mean. It's just a really great floral perfume. If you love Diptyque's Baies candle, this scent is for you. I love this perfume so much that I've even purchased the body lotion, and I have asked my husband for a bottle of the shower gel for a Valentine's Day gift as well. He also loves the scent too, so yay.  Also, if it's any help---my previous favorite scents to wear were Burberry London, Ralph Lauren Blue, and Valentino's Valentina. I would occasionally wear Tom Ford's Violet Blonde and Calvin Klein Euphoria, but both would leave me with a headache often. Roses de Chloe beats all of these. I rarely leave reviews for product, but I can't recommend this scent enough! The best."

Not a compliment :( It smells like roses, true to its name. However, in my opinion, it smells like a little old lady who has dementia and kept putting her perfume on again and again.

With that said, it's a bit pricey.  The rose scent is delicate, unique and subtle. It doesn't smell like a florist shop on Valentine's Day or a grandmother (roses remind me of mine). However, on me, other notes quickly masks the rose scent. It still smells delicate and fresh, in my opinion.  It's a limited-edition fragrance so I hope Chloe will improve the scent and its lasting quality."
