The mist helps to speed up the blow drying process, and it smells great too. I find that it also helps to give my hair more body and volume. The mist is also great when it comes to straightening my hair as it helps to control the frizz. I now have three of these mists and I'm really happy with the results. Overall, I highly recommend this product for anyone who wants to speed up the blow drying process, and get more body and volume in their hair."

I have such a hard time getting volume into my fine hair, I use volumizing shampoos, sprays, mousse and blow dry with a round brush but still sometimes ends up flat but I had so much volume with this spray.  I have only used it once but I can usually tell after one use if it is going to work and this definitely did.  For reference I used it with the Color wow volume mousse and had tons of volume.  It also smells amazing and doesn't leave my hair crunchy or with a product film on it."

This blow dry mist really improves the appearance of my hair. It makes it instantly look healthier and creates a soft and shiny finish. I love that it protects my hair from heat and makes it so I can feel comfortable blow drying. I still use the cool setting to not overdo it but this has improved the time it takes to dry. My hair is 30 inches long so this part is huge got me. Overall a really amazing heat protecting spray that will help the overall final appearance of your hair."
