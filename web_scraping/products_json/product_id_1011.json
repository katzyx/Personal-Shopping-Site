It makes my liquid makeup matt and this does not cake or increase lines like some users have stated. This gives me a solid and perfect finish. I wear a mask all day at my job and this actually keeps my makeup on my face and not in my mask! Nothing else Iu2019ve tried has done this. I absolutely love this powder. When in doubt, go with the translucent as you canu2019t tell itu2019s on. A must try for sure."

I was shiny within 4 hours. I could see my pores and makeup separate by the end of the day. I wish it was long lasting and had a blurring effect but it didn't.

Although the description states it is best for normal, combination, and oily skin, it feels mattifying but not dehydrating on my dry skin.  The translucent shade is a beige hue that will seamlessly blend into the vast majority of skin tones.  On my very fair skin tone, I have to use the powder sparingly or it will darken my makeup.  Don't be intimidated by the triangular packaging.  The sifter can be completely removed to get out any powder that is stuck in the corners."

This powder is incredibly lightweight and sets my makeup beautifully without looking cakey or heavy. I love the pressed version of this powder for all over the skin, and the loose powder for under the eyes. The formula is also clean and gentle on my skin, which is a huge plus. I highly recommend this product to anyone looking for a flawless, long-lasting finish. It's a new staple in my makeup routine!"

It completely blurs out almost all imperfections and lines and leaves my makeup looking so pretty. The niacinamide and other great skin care ingredients keep your skin healthy even with makeup on. Itu2019s pretty easy to use, I havenu2019t had any issues applying it. LYS has hit another one out of the park! I will definitely be getting the Sincere shade as well!"

I love that it has a stopper to go over where the powder comes out so it doesnu2019t leak out everywhere when itu2019s closed. The actual powder is beautiful and so finely milled and really fills in every single pore to give you the most flawless finish. I have dry skin so some powders can really make my skin look cakey but this does not at all. I wanted to show the difference with and without the powder so I attached a photo so you can truly see the difference this powder makes! I canu2019t wait to try the pink shade next!"

It sets my makeup without making my skin feel dry or heavy. It keeps my face from looking shiny all day, but still lets my skin look natural. The best part is how it makes my skin look smooth and hides my pores. It gives a nice finish that lasts a long time. Highly recommend it!"
