Dont get why people are spending so much buying each individual color of correctors nowadays but if yall wanna save some money STILA is and will always take the crown for color correctors. As a makeup artist this is one of my most repurchased products. The blend wear and finish I get with both the creams and the powders doesnt compare to any of the new color correcting  concealers that have came out recently. Ive probably tried every corrector under the sun on my clients and myself, and guys- take it from me, it doesnt get better than this"

I trust that the product is actually good since there are so many colors to be mixed and used according your skin tone, and based on other good reviews.

She said it is only available in the palette, and directed me to the One Step Correct as a possible alternative; this turned out to be a poor substitute.  Maybe the faint pink lines on my face and dark circles need something stronger than what's offered in this palette -- or perhaps I just don't know how to properly use it, despite the nice little set of instructions enclosed in the box (much appreciated)."

First, it was so easy to use and the consistency of the product is perfect; creamy and not too thick. My foundation applied beautifully over the corrector. My makeup looked so flawless!

However, the redness corrector really dries out my skin even after I moisturize well and apply primer. Its disappointing so I will stick to using liquid correctors. When I apply my foundation overtop, the green corrector literally disappears and it looks like I havent put anything underneath so I have to go back in again with my regular concealer on top (creating an unnecessary layer of makeup).   I use the pink eye brightening corrector which I have neutral feelings towards. I can do with or without it. I use the beige colour corrector as a concealer. I dont use the 2 powders In the palette; I just dont see a need for them for myself but other people may find them useful.

Instead, apply it sparingly to take away hints of red, blue, and purple. Then use a lightweight concealer to go slightly higher. And don't forget to live your lines.

I was able to experiment to try to find the best application to minimize the discolorations. Although it seemed to do the trick upon application, it didnt last and often times I found that the blemishes were pretty much back to pre-application. I would use this in combination with my trusty concealer. I also compared the effect on my skin with the concealer and with or without the correcting palette and it really didnt show a difference.

All the colors work just fine, my only issue is with the orange cream but since it is the one I use the most , I dont pick the palette as often."

I hesitated using this thinking I wouldn't know how to use it or it wouldn't work or it would irritate my skin.  I used it today for the first time and it worked!  I didn't pile it on like some people do.  I just patted the creams in the places I needed it, blended a bit with my fingers and then finished with my BeautyBlender (also a new purchase). I then finished with Dior foundation and Laura Mercier setting powder and my very red face looked flawless. I don't even feel like I have make up on.  I feel beautiful today. For the first time, I feel like my skin didn't get in the way of my make up and I had so many compliments."

I'm pretty new to color correcting, and other than lots of samples this is the only color correction palette I have tried.   Pros: Great for people new to color correcting, since it comes with a lot of different shades. I was totally skeptical of the green and honestly would never have tried it if it wasn't included with colors I did want (like the ones for undereye darkness), but now I think it's great. This gives you lots of small things to try and a little guidance, which was great for me.   Cons: I think my major caveat is just that the colors could be creamier and go on a bit smoother - I find mine to be a little on the dry side especially now that I have had this for a couple of months. They still overall are definitely better than *not* color correcting (especially for under my eyes, I'm all about color correcting now), but there may be creamier products out there.   Overall, no regrets about this as a first color correcting palette purchase."

Also, the green and the other small size pots are just really small.  The brush I use is as big as the pot, so when I swipe some out, I inevitably end up getting green on top of the orange and peach colors, so that's just kind of annoying. I also wish the lavender color was cream instead of powder.  I just think it would be more versatile that way. But overall, as this was my first entry to color correcting, I think this was a really good palette.  It comes with a little instruction pamphlet, and I learned a lot about how to use the orange and green correctly.  I would definitely recommend this for anyone just starting to try color correcting."

The yellow does not work for my skin tone and did not even mask my hyperpigmentation at all. The green is great but you really have to build it up to get coverage and sometimes it still rubs off when you apply your foundation. The colors are a little too slippery. I still don't understand why the product says to apply corrector, then powder, and then foundation. You should not put liquids over powder. I even tried it the way Stila says just to be sure and it made a mess. I really like the powders and I like the set up, with the little plastic piece over the creams to protect them. I still use the peach and the green color every day and I like them, I just don't think the whole kit is worth 5 stars.

            "review_text": "Really shocked at all the negative reviews. I have combination skin and did not find this even the least bit oily. My skin is pale with redness on my cheeks and chin (not rosacea), so the green is pigmented just enough for me. My favorite part of this palette is actually the yellow powder. Every other setting powder I've ever used has made me look like a clown, due to my pale skin, but this one is PERFECT! Yes, the orange cream is very dark, but it's meant for very dark circles. It says right in the included pamphlet that you may need to mix the two under eye creams, so that's what I did and it worked out well. My only complaint is that I'll be running out of the green cream long before the others - it should really be a larger amount, since that's what people need the most of."

I've never put anything on my face that made it oily and dry at the same time. I used it under my eyes and it actually made them so dry they started peeling. And it settles into lines making you age a good 10 years! No matter how sheer I put it on it always went strait into the lines. The green covered the red areas in my face but did NOTHING to hide imperfections. I tried multiple techniques and watched videos to try and do this correctly but it was still terrible.

The makeup looks nice at first, but within a few hours my face looked so greasy because this product is so oily. Even worse, within a few days I started breaking out. At first I I was hoping it was a diet imbalance, but then I starting breaking out bad EVERYWHERE I had been using the green and yellow to cover healing pimples and old dark spots. Bought it to cover blemishes and ended up with a face full of them. Returned it!"

I have light/medium skin with yellow undertones and the orange was too dark for me, but the peach did a great job hiding the dark circles, but within  minutes I looked ten years older because it settled in my lines. If you don't have dry skin, this might work for you, but I am exchanging it for the Algenist Peach color correcting serum. It is much lighter weight and doesn't settle the way this does. The powders are very nice, just not worth the price tag if the other creams don't work for me."

However, the red correcting cream is PERFECTION and hides my dark circles really well. I also love both powders. In the picture, I am wearing the red cream corrector under my eyes, followed by the peach corrector, topped off with my usual concealer (not Stila), and followed by the purple powder. I used the yellow powder on my entire face to set my makeup. The products are easy to blend (some might find them a bit oily) and do not crease. Overall, I think this is a great palette to have, especially when travelling or on the go."

Second, I love how there are descriptions of the colors and what they are used for on the back so that you know exactly how to use the product. Lastly, the finishing powders in this palette are absolutely amazing. I wish they would make the lavender finishing powder as stand alone. The cream correctors do dry to a almost a powdery finish. I'm not super impressed by the actual cream corrector part I think there are quite a few other brands that have better correctors out there. However, I will definitely keep the palette since its great for travel and the powders alone or worth keeping."
