Iu2019ve found that it works best when used with a facial brush, such as a Clarisonic or Foreo; it really helps to get the sulfur and good ingredients into each little pore. My skin gets sensitive if I use it twice a day, so I went down to once a day and itu2019s perfect. I will be repurchasing when I run out. It seems to help my hormonal breakouts. Sulfur is never a good smell but itu2019s really mild and the benefits/results outweigh the fragrance of the product."

            "review_text": "I wanted to love it so badly after Dr. Shereene Idriss recommended it on her Youtube channel for those who suffer from acne, which is me. However, I have somewhat sensitive skin, and from what I am reading online, the pH of some sulfur cleansers like this one can be too strong on the skin causing it to breakout or have a skin purge effect that is somewhat similar to retinol. If my skin is purging, it will be due to retinol, NOT a cleanser. I have never had a break out this badly since my teens or if I am using a new skincare product that does not agree with my skin type. Sadly, this cleanser from Kate Somerville is one of them, which is a shame because I love the foaming aspect of it while it feels like a traditional clay mask that you'd apply to your face 2-3 times a week."

            "review_text": "fyi i was not paid for this review. I bought this on sale after seeing hype for it on tik tok. I have sensitive oily to combination skin with moderate cystic acne along my jaw and neck, enlarged pores on my nose and cheeks, and sebaceous filaments on my nose. I have never used a product that so dramatically changed my skin. I did a patch test then washed my face with it one night. I was grateful I didnu2019t have a reaction to this product because itu2019s common for me to have a red face after trying something new (even with a patch test). It definitely has that sulfur smell which I donu2019t mind just make sure you rinse it well. I noticed after washing that my skin felt clean and smooth and I made sure to hydrate really well because i was worried about drying out. The next day I noticed my face did not get oily throughout the day at all! Usually by noon Iu2019ve become oily, especially on my nose and forehead. After one use I noticed that difference. Now after two weeks of using about every other day, I can say that my sebaceous filaments on my nose have greatly reduced, my skin looks clearer, and Iu2019m much less oily. I still have the hormonal cystic acne on my jaw and neck, but it seems smaller than usual so thatu2019s a plus. My recommendation is to hydrate well after washing with this product to prevent your skin from drying. Iu2019m so glad I gave this product a try and I think it will be worth it in the future to even buy it full price (Iu2019m usually an on-sale purchaser only). If you have sebaceous filaments and/ or oily skin I recommend this product!"

I use this twice a day. I let it have time on my skin, usually leaving it on while I brush my teeth or prep for a shower, anywhere from 3 to 10 minutes. This makes all the difference. It has seriously reduced my faces swelling so while I still get some pore clogs and blackheads, they don't swell up into pimples as much anymore. I've been using it around 3 or 4 months now and it did take at least 1 before I was seeing some results and I've only recently started feeling that my skin is smooth (I still have scars which it doesn't help with). I use an expholient twice a week and spray the tower 28 sos spray instead of toner and in the evenings I use a serum from Clearstem with an acid just for acne. I definately  recommend patch testing this as some people's skin may not Like the sulfur but I think it finally ended my 10+ years of acne!"

I also find that I get more frequent breakouts than I did in my 20s. I started using this product once a day with a free sample and noticed an immediate difference, and purchased the full size once it became available and started using it morning and night. I cannot believe the difference- I donu2019t use my matte primer anymore because my skin actually just isnu2019t over-producing so much oil. I never see the little pustules anymore and I barely need to use any of my colour correcting bb cream. Iu2019m so glad to have found something that actually works for my skin! Maybe sulfur isnu2019t the ingredient for everyone (and it does get kind of stinky lol) but it definitely is the thing for me."

When I tell you Iu2019ve tried nearly every acne cleanser out there I mean I HAVE TRIED THEM ALL.  The only one that ever made a difference is the original Proactive cleanser but Iu2019ve stopped using products that contain parabens and it wasnu2019t working for me like it used to anyways.  Iu2019ve found that salycic acid cleansers donu2019t work for me and neither does benzoyl peroxide, although it used to.  I picked this up during Ultau2019s 21 days of beauty sale figuring I had nothing to lose and within a week my skin had completely cleared up for the first time in over a year.  I started reading about the benefits of sulfur for acne prone skin and wish Iu2019d had known about it so much sooner!  Iu2019ve been using this cleanser for over a month now and still get the occasional pimple around that time of the month but itu2019s a night and day difference from before.  I can actually leave the house without foundation and feel comfortable in my skin.  If youu2019ve tried salicylic acid or benzoyl peroxide cleansers and they havenu2019t worked for you pleeeaaase give this a shot.  The only downside is that it has a very mild scent (to be expected with any product containing sulfur), but itu2019s not at all overbearing and dissipates once you wash it off.  But if youu2019re super sensitive to scents, maybe get it when itu2019s on sale or buy a mini first.  So happy I found a product that works for me!!!"

I typically have true combo skin, bad blackheads, extremely sensitive and acne prone skin especially when over-exfoliated. After narrowing my acne down to a fungal acne caused by varying hormone levels, I searched high and low for sulfur containing products to accompany a topical anti fungal prescribed from my physician. This face wash is one of the few suggested for fungal acne, and the only one you need. My skin has not looked this good in over a year and a half (even with just the topical anti fungal ).

This wash seems like it will work, but is too stripping for acne.  I used to think that the more dried out my skin was then there wouldn't be any bacteria alive.  But what I was really doing was throwing off my skin's moisture barrier and causing it to overproduce oil, which further inflamed my acne.  This wash is no exception. There are better hydrating cleansers that will not inflame or strip your skin.  I personally use the First aid Beauty pure skin cleanser, and the Youth to the People superfood cleanser and have had wonderful topical results."

When I reached out to let them know they basically told me it was user error and I should always remove jewelry before using products (which I have never done over the years of wearing that necklace everyday) and they were not willing to compensate me for my now dark graphite Tiffany&Co necklace. Besides their average customer service, this product is just that. Average. My skin has always been normal with the usual hormonal breakout but since using this product for the past months, my skin has been at its worst. Do not waste your money on this product."

This cleanser IS drying, but not unbearably so - I have dry skin and use this at night and definitely need moisturizer after, but it doesn't make me feel tight or stripped. And while I don't get acne much anymore I've noticed this dries up the few whiteheads I get around my period so that's a nice bonus.

This stuff is really good, I only need a pea sized amount each night and rub it in when it's foamy for 30 sec as advised. It's great at stopping and preventing breakouts, and getting rid of that problematic dead skin. A couple weeks of usage and my face is nicely becoming smooth along with my neck. My nose area doesn't get as much pustules as before and is smoothing out too. It works as well as my old prescription. But please, YMMV. I would go back to my prescription if I could.  Unpopular opinion, but I love the smell of sulfur. This foam smells like floral sulfur, they were trying very hard to mask it. Eventually the real sulfur smell comes through and lingers. It might not be for you if you can't stand the smell.  I combine this with azelaic acid and centella products for even more benefits as I have lingering redness and PIH.  It's worth the expense, especially if you only use a small amount once a night this bottle can last several months. Plus, the light pink color is so cute."

While the cleanser doesn't stop breakouts from happening completely (I don't know if any one product would be able to do that), continuous use has shortened the length of time of the breakouts, and decreased the severity. I use it in the morning and it makes me skin feel so fresh, and I use a different cleanser with makeup removing properties in the evening."

And it makes it easier to travel without bringing extra acne fighters along with me. I think it does help with my acne too! It is expensive though and isn't great at removing makeup. If I need to remove makeup I just wash with cetaphil fist (Makeup removers give me cystic acne). I will keep on buying this and using it, but I wish it was cheaper. It does last for a wile though.

I talked to my doctor about pregnancy safe alternatives and did lots of online research which led me to this product. Not only is it pregnancy safe but it is probably the most effective acne cleanser I have ever used! I have far fewer breakouts even with my hormones going crazy from pregnancy and it does wonders for keeping shine at bay in my t-zone while not over drying the rest of my face. I should mentioned I have combo skin and tend to have a very oily t-zone but normal-dry cheeks. I only use this is the AM followed by a vitamin c serum and moisturizer. It has a bit of a sulfur smell but hey what do you expect from a cleanser that has sulfur as an active ingredient? The smell doesnu2019t linger on your face but can linger on your device if you use one to wash your face. I use the FOREO Luna 3 and have to make sure I rinse all the cleanser out after each wash to keep the smell away. This is definitely a product I will continue to buy even after I can use salicylic acid again, it is just so good!"

I've battled awful, hormonal acne since going off the birth control pill and starting fertility treatments (IUI, IVF, etc) about a year ago. I used ALL the chemicals (salicylic, BP, etc.) and nothing really helped.   I got pregnant (yay!) but then the acne only got worse and more stubborn and spreading. I went to Sephora yesterday and asked specifically for something with SULFUR, because chemicals like Salicylic, etc. are not safe for baby and not allowed when pregnant.   So I bought this yesterday and have to say after after 2 uses I noticed immediate results - NO NEW BREAKOUTS this morning for the first time in months and the redness looking visibly calmer and lighter. I'm floored!   Some people mentioned smell being bad? I think it smells fine! For a Sulfur product, I was expecting a rotten egg smell but it was honestly fine. Also, I love the cream texture - if you don't use tons of water at first, it can kind of sit on your face a bit before you rinse it off, which I like.   Overall, I'm really impressed so far and optimistic."

I use this as a second cleanse if I'm wearing make up and on its own for a stand alone gentle cleanse and my skin has never been better in a decade.

I even broke out a little more than usual the first few weeks, but I wanted to give it a chance to clean out my pores, and I know that retinol (in some of the other Kate Somerville products) is supposed to take a few months to work. But I noticed NO reduction in blackheads, kept breaking out, and just got frustrated that I wasn't seeing results. Maybe if I'd stayed with it for longer, it would've eventually worked, but I just lost patience with something I was using every day wasn't doing anything for my skin. Maybe it works for others, just not for me. And the new system I switched to started showing results almost immediately, which is what I'd prefer!"

So I went to my local Sephora and got it, along with the EradiKate Acne Treatment. Honestly using these two products together has been one of the best thing that has happen to my skin! Not even one week later, my skin has been clearing up so much. I use this cleanser twice a day. Once in the morning and once at night, after I cleanse my face at night, I use the acne treatment and leave it over night (washing it in the morning). Sometimes, I'll leave it on for a few hours before I cleanse my face that night if I don't want to leave it overnight. But I can really say, these products are great and has helped my clear my face of acne. I don't over dry my face like other products and leaving my face feeling tight.

The first time I used it, the oil was GONE it was absolutely incredible. My skin felt great. I decided this is what I've been looking for all along. I continued to use it out of my sample, which lasted several days because I didn't need to use much, ordered it immediately. Then after a few days of use my skin got really sensitive, which never happens, and got really dry and flaky everywhere except my T-zone. I tried limiting use to once a day and then once every other day. Now I just use it in the morning every few days to keep it up. My skin isn't getting oily in between days which I find absolutely amazing. Long story short, I think is product is incredible, just not as a every day cleanser for me. I haven't decided if I should keep it or return it as I haven't actually had to open the full size product yet."

I am so impressed with not only how fast my breakouts cleared up, but also with how great overall my skin looks. I'm staying pretty matte throughout the whole day, and my skin just looks so much better. Pores are less visible and acne gone!

It doesn't dry my skin out, my skin feels clean and fresh. The scent isn't too strong. As you spread the cleanser it starts to foam slightly for a deeper clean. Not too sure if it's helping with my acne. It's really hard to say. I feel like it's toned it down over the past month. I still get breakouts and the odd cystic pimple."

I had seriously given up on the idea that my acne would ever clear up and wear makeup everyday to boost my self esteem. I bought this thinking it may help a little but didnu2019t have high hopes. BUY THIS PRODUCT. Seriously, just buy it. I use it with my Clarisonic brush after I use a cheap cleanser to remove my makeup. Afterwards I use the eradikate acne treatment (BUY THAT TOO!) and follow up with an aveeno moisturizer. Itu2019s amazing, my skin is clearer than itu2019s been in almost 15 years. Iu2019ll never go without it again. If youu2019re on the fence, try it."

Yes I have gone through some medication one of them was tactupump forte (in canada ), which of course  has solved a lot. But I never stopped using this cleanser. I do use this once a day. And when I am having some breakouts I use twice a day."

I was told by my doctor to remove my makeup and THEN use the acne wash on my problem areas.   The company that made my sulphur face was discontinued the version I used and replaced it with a new version for $200 for 8 oz per bottle AFTER insurance.  I went into my Sephora looking for a sulphur face wash. I was recommended this and the mask. This works so well. I first remove my makeup with my favorite makeup remover and THEN I wash my T-zone with just a pea sized amount. It doesn't dry me out and my cystic acne only pops up under major times of stress. I then use the One the Spot sulphur treatment."

Within a few weeks my skin had completely cleared up and stayed clear. Stubborn pimples that wouldn't go away finally shrunk down into oblivion. On top of that my skin wasn't burning from dryness. I would highly recommend this product to anyone with acne, but especially those of us inflicted with the dreaded curse of adult acne. It's expensive but worth it. The only downside is it does smell sulfur-y, but small price to pay in my opinion. I would recommend checking out all of Kate Somerville's acne products - they work."

I am in my 30u2019s and over the course of the last year started dealing with severe adult acne which has caused quite a bit of depression for me. After seeing the dermatologist monthly...Iu2019ve been on numerous antibiotics, started on birth control, aldactone, and multiple prescription face creams. Iu2019ve even made diet changes to reduce and eliminate dairy from my diet, which for some people exacerbates acne. None of which have worked to even begin to control the acne. I spend countless hours researching how to resolve the problem and found this cleanser to have high reviews and gave it a shot on a whim. After the first use, I surprisingly noticed a difference. And now after about 5 days of use (along with the spot treatment by Kate) the existing acne on my face is almost all dried up. And, itu2019s prevented new acne from forming. Iu2019m thrilled to have found something that works so drastically. This product is highly recommended!"

I suggest putting this on a slightly damp face (only need a tiny amount like nickle sized) and leaving it on while you brush your teeth then rinse it off. The extra time on your face really makes a difference. Oddly enough, the other products by Kate did not help my acne at all so if you are struggling like I was, try this first."

The price was a turn off, especially not knowing anything about Kate Somerville. I just purchased my first full size and less than a week all the pimples that I could feel surfacing under my skin are gone and the current ones are going away. My skin isn't overly dry, maybe because I use the TARTE maracuja oil right after I wash (with a Clarisonic I might add.....), and I wake up to great glowing skin. It's been years since my face has looked this great and I can even tell a difference applying my makeup. Also, I have super duper oily skin. I look like I've been playing in baby oil after an hour or so IF I DONT WEAR MAKEUP.... This is definitely a staple in my beauty collection. It's pricey, but a little goes A LONG WAAAAY!!!! I just add a pea sized amount in the center of my clarisonic and go. I have the Glam Glow cleanser (the white bottle) in the same size as this, and I've been using it for about 2.5 months if that helps to give an idea of how long it will last, and I'm about 1/3 through the Glam Glow face wash. You wont be sorry for spending the money on this IF this works for your skin. KATE, WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN ALL MY LIFE?!?!!?!"

I found using it twice a day is too drying on my already dry skin and irritates my sensitive skin a bit too, but once a day is perfect. My adult/cystic acne reacts well to sulfur and I like that this is a gentler option than what I've been prescribed before by my dermatologist. It helps my surface acne to clear a bit and helps prevent newer ones as well. Definitely give this a try if you're hesitant like I was. It might not be a cure all, but it's pretty good and using once a day, a pea sized amount, I've had my bottle for several months."

I was told by Kendra from Sephora that this would work so quick that you'd see a difference in your skin within the first use. I was skeptical at first, but after one wash I immediately noticed a difference in my skin. The little bumps on my skin that surfaced after a bad reaction to a cc cream had gone down significantly--- they were still there, but very much less noticeable. I can't wait to see what a months worth of continued usage will bring!"

Just don't get it in your eyes and be warned you can smell the sulfur but it's all worth it to have clear beautiful skin! The smell doesn't linger and it doesn't dry out my skin, but I always follow up with a moisturizer."
