    "about": "Fragrance Family: Florals..Scent Type: Classic Florals..Key Notes: Blackcurrant, Peony, White Amber..Fragrance Description: This classic and clean, skin-loving floral is a charming and innately cool bouquet with an abundance of peonies and a blush of blackcurrant. The notes of spherical blooms are joined by touches of white flowers including tuberose, rose, and jasmine, while soft white amber and sandalwood offer a smooth and soft finish...About the Bottle: An oversized bow, perfectly imperfect. The LoveShackFancy perfume bottle references founder Rebecca Hessel Cohen\u2019s lifelong love of ribbons with a sculptural bow top that appears tied and tightened by hand. The sky blue and white Ever-Blooming Rosette print is a signature design chosen from over 2,000 in the LoveShackFancy print and lace library to decorate the bottle itself, a softly curved antique-inspired vessel carved with scalloping on top and a ring of rope on the bottom. Once finished, its spray top is removable so the bottle can be upcycled as a bud vase...About the Fragrance: Naturally cool with an undeniable charm. Boh\eme is a spirited floral that captures a peony in full bloom, laced with blackcurrant and soft white amber. A forever romantic, endlessly in pursuit of wanderlust. Created with love and an intriguing, light warmth by perfumer Yves Cassar....CLEAN at Sephora is our commitment to offering formulas that go beyond regulatory standards to avoid controversial ingredients without sacrificing on effectiveness.",

It goes on strong and the powdery soft notes weren\u2019t hitting. Now that it\u2019s sat the entire day I can still smell it and it has more of the subtle soft smell I was looking for. I would say a little goes a long way and to apply sparingly."

In my experience, it has outlived all of my other perfumes. I like I Want You by Jimmy Choo, but it\u2019s gone in an hour. And I love the perfume shaped like a robot called Rabainne or something. (Idk, I just like it he\u2019s cute, and it is my ideal scent, it just doesn\u2019t last) But I was going on a long walk under tge hot Texas sun and ppl were still asking me \u201cwhat are you wearing?\u201d. And I sprayed a coupla hours ago before walking. But please remember, perfume has a lot to do with body chemistry. What works for me doesn\u2019t work for you. But the scent alone in amazing. Just do what I did, and grab the travel size for your purse so you can refresh if you need to."

I really like it, and I love the blue packaging. So pretty!"

The peony is light and floral, while the blackcurrant adds a nice touch of fruitiness that's not too overpowering. The white amber ties it all together with a hint of warmth that makes the perfume feel cozy and inviting.  There's something about this scent that just makes me feel happy and at ease. It\u2019s become my go-to fragrance when I want to feel a bit more put-together. If you\u2019re looking for a new scent that\u2019s both fresh and comforting, I\u2019d definitely recommend giving Boheme a try!"

Two sprays were enough to immediately transport me to my grandmother's garden where she had peonies planted and I could always smell their scent in the distance. I remember that in my childhood I used to love cutting the peonies and making small bouquets to put in vases around the house. What makes this fragrance more delicious is the perfect combination of peonies with the blush of a blackcurrant and the notes of blooms that are touched with white flowers like tuberose, rose, and jasmine, while soft white amber and sandalwood offer a smooth and soft finish."

The key notes listed (black currant, peony, and amber) are not the stars of this fragrance. This is, at its core, a white floral. My skin pulls the jasmine and tuberose the most, then some peony, and the amber and sandalwood sit prettily in the background. It reminds me at times of Pure Poison. This beauty has staying power and projection; a date night fragrance and a compliment getter. Boheme is romantic, sophisticated, clean, and lovely. I have all three of the LoveShackFancy perfumes, and this one is my unexpected favorite."
