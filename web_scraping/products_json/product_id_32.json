It's a true clear gel not a milky colour like others and has a nice hold without being too stiff. Love that it's clean; also love the minimalist tube. The wand bristles are longer on one side, which is the side I prefer using. I wish the long bristles went the whole way around - the product disperses much more evenly without over saturating the brow hairs. This is the first Ami Cole product I've purchased. The packaging is really luxe and looks high end. Overall really pleased. Will definitely repurchase and am looking forward to trying their other products!"

I prefer color with a neutral undertone (on occasion with a cool undertone) in mid to deep shades. Eyeshadows in mid to deep blues, purples (not plum), greens, browns and greys. Lippies in brown with purple (not plum) undertone, vampy reds, muted purples and deep mauve and berries.  As much as I want to like this (I love almost all your other products), this one doesn't give me the hold I need.   I thought it might be because it's too wet or too much on the wand and wiped some off. However, my brow hairs still fall. Even after attempting to plaster them down as it dries.  If you're someone who doesn't need a lot of hold, this is for you. I need cement."

You get more product than the Kosas clear brow gel for less money (and honestly, Kosas products are always a miss for me once they start smelling weird). I have sparse 90s Kate Moss brows and just need them to stay up, this did the trick with no weird issues or flaking. The long side of the brush is very clever and helps to really saturate your brows before putting them in their place."

My brow hairs still fly in all kinds of directions and the gel doesn't hold them down or shape them. Finally, this product is just not worth $20. Save your money and find something else."
