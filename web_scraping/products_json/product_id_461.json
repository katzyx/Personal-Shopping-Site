I have 8 other stretch mark prevention serums / cream from other brands that I rotate, and I can’t say this one is my favourite :(  the oil has very unpleasant scent and the texture is not smooth, so you end up using quite a bit. I am not sure if it actually does the job or not because I use other products tooo, but for the price point , I would’ve expected at least better texture and I wouldn’t buy it again."

I have been using it on my tummy as child birth was not kind to me and my husband has actually been using it on his arms because he was starting to get stretch marks from muscle growth on his arms and so far we both have seen great results. My husband’s stretch marks on his arms have reduced by about 30-40% in about three weeks use, I would say my stretch marks on my stomach, which have been with me for quite a few years now I see about a 20% reduction in size. I’m pretty happy with these results and so is he. A little goes along way so I’m excited to see how much more results we can get. The smell is very beautiful and floral. Very feminine. it is a very thick cream so make sure you’re not putting it on under anything nice, I use it at night so that I don’t have to worry about wrecking any clothing. It does absorb well, but not as it is quite a thick oil. We love it. Something to try, it definitely works better than other ones that I’ve  tried."

Starting with the packaging, it feels and gives off lux product but more over the actual serum is wonderful. I used it on a stretch mark just to see if there would be a difference between the one I was using it on and the one next to it and there is a definite visible difference.  I've only tried this at the underside of my belly but did start to play it elsewhere. However I need a week or so more before I can tell if there is a difference in other locations as well. I also appreciate the fact that it does not have a particular scent and it dries or absorbs into the skin quickly so it doesn't leave residue elsewhere. Regardless, i'd recommend for your stomach! I've only used it for two weeks but consistently it seems to work. I also love love love using on my face because it seems to soak it in really well!"

J’aime son emballage de présentation, il est très mignon en plus de son arôme agréable, il est très facile à appliquer grâce à son distributeur et il adsorbe très bien votre peau ! J'ai une peau grasse et ça a fonctionné surtout en hiver où la peau se dessèche et a besoin de plus d'hydratation et de douceur j'aime son ingrédient spécial comme la centella asiatica 🥰 huile de marula et huile de rose musquée qui laissent un résultat brillant sur mon visage la faisant regarder plus jeune et plus lisse chaque jour je le recommande vivement les filles"

I was skeptical and confused about this product and why it was gifted to me considering it’s a line catered towards pregnant people (which I am not). Though, using these products over the last little bit and doing a bit of research on them, I’ve come to really love the line.  I use this serum as an all over body oil after the shower. I put this on first and then layer a body lotion on top (I alternate between brands). It feels super soft and hydrating. But the reason I especially like it is because of how well it has been soothing the irritation over my body. I’ve been doing laser hair removal on my entire body and I find after shaving the night before my skin gets really irritated, and becomes even more irritated after the laser treatments. After I shower I apply this on my skin and I find it helps to soothe any irritation from the laser treatment which I’ve been liking.  I do have some stretch marks from a couple years ago and this serum really has not done anything to help with those but I also did not expect it to considering those stretch marks are old. It could be more effective in reducing the appearance of new and forming stretch marks, just probably not old ones."

I massaged it onto my itchy belly of stretch marks religiously and daily. I made sure that I do not miss a day so that I can see how this product works. I then saw that the ingredients are made from marula, passionfruit extract and centella which is nice for skin hydration and moisturizing. It relieved my belly from being itchy from my growing stretch marks. I still continue with the application daily in hopes that my stretch marks would be alleviated or lightened. After a month of using this product, nothing really happened on my stretch marks, but moisturizer part this work as I stopped scratching. The smell is just my favorite because I love the scenet of new born babies. Would I recommend this to other moms and friends who has stretch marks? Probably yes because it did moisturized my belly and stopped me from experiencing itchiness from stretchingbelly skin.    Overall, I'm still happy with this product eventhough it didn't lighten my belly nor firm my skin. It did helped a lot to be hydrated."

I have a lot of stretch marks and loose skin on my belly from pregnancy, but this serum firmed it up decently. as I wait for my full sized product to arrived, the progress has disappeared, so I'm thinking that I either need to use it more long term, or its just results based as long as I'm actively using it. either way, it's totally worth it! I like the scent as well!"

I am so happy with the results! I am looking forward to using this serum for longer to see if it'll fade the stretch marks even more. The smell is pleasant and doesn't bother me at all. The serum absorbs very quickly and feels light, not oily. The packaging is amazing, so pretty and serum is easy to use, especially with the dropper. The ingredients feel natural and I feel comfortable using it on my skin. I love this product and would recommend to anyone experiencing dull skin with stretch marks! It's highly effective!"

For starters, the bottle is a see through square, glass container with a squeeze syringe style stopper. This looks so gorgeous on my bathroom vanity and it looks super luxurious! The quality is also top notch as this has my pregnant belly absolutely glowing!  I have been using this serum daily for the past two weeks and have noticed such an improvement in my skin. I fortunately do not have stretch marks and am currently 7 months pregnant but I found this serum to be so nourishing and soothing on my growing belly, hips, thighs and chest area. This blend of 11 concentrated botanicals have helped soothe my dry skin and helped with my skins elasticity which has allowed me to remain stretch mark free! My belly feels so comfortable and is hydrated and truly glowing. I love that I am able to use this in the postpartum stage of my pregnancy as well.   I love that is is free of parabens, phthalates, synthetic fragrances and sulfates as I try to be extra cautious with what I am putting on my skin, especially on my belly area. The serum is super easy to use and does not remain greasy on the skin. It absorbs quickly and keeps my skin hydrated for hours. It also smells amazing which is a bonus! I highly recommend this to pregnant or postpartum mamas as it has made such a huge difference on my growing belly and skin!"

I’ve been using this product for a week and  notice my marks are slightly lighter. With more consistent use I can only imagine the further difference it could make. I’ve also heard great things from others prior to receiving samples as well who used this long term and had incredible results.

My stretch marks had lightened by the time I started using, so I can’t comment on how effective it is for that. But it feels like a luxury body treatment, and really nice on the skin. The consistency is like a thick serum and has a subtle light clean smell.  I use on my stomach and (10 month healed) csection scar - hasn’t lightened the scar yet but feels very soothing on it. It’s not greasy but does feel like it sits on the skin a bit (in a good way in my opinion). Worth it for a luxury product, and definitely something I would have loved while pregnant."

This serum is really lovely. It’s packed with lots of great skin loving and moisturizing oils, it’s fragrance free (although it smells a touch like chamomile). The best thing about it though is how quickly it absorbs, and how long the skin feels moisturized for after. I have been applying this immediately before bed daily for two weeks, and I can hop into bed almost immediately after without worrying about getting the oil all over the sheets. And I wake up with super soft skin, and it looks nourished and less dull.  I’ve been applying this on my chest, stomach, hips and bottom. It is a little on the pricey side, but honestly, the quality is pretty top notch. Plus the packaging is soooo pretty.  I can’t wait to see results as I continue using this, it’ll take at least a whole bottle to see how it does for the stretch marks."

I use about 3 drops to cover my belly thigh and buttocks (I know this is only for belly, but I wanted to see it work in the other areas too). The first time I used it I felt a burning sensation on its own on my belly, but second time this sensation was gone. So not sure if it’s because my skin was super dry the first time.  I use this as a combo with the cream. It has made my belly, buttocks and thighs glow with new life. Skin feels firmer and more younger. I have only used it for a week and have seen improvement in my skin. I believe this is an 8 week treatment. So I’ll continue to use this and see the benefits after 2 months I hope. This combo has totally brought my sexy back. Not sure if this would do anything for my wrinkles or stretch mark on its own. Probably safer to use together with the stretch mark cream to see the benefits working."

These both beautiful products go hand in hand and absolutely amazing to use. I used it for about 15 days now and I would want to share that it definitely helps my belly stretch because I feel it was pretty tight and had lot of dark marks before. But after using it they have gone lighter and the evereden products are a must use in order to see the results themselves. I will definitely be recommending it to my friends and family"

The texture is divine as it warms up in your hands it becomes much thinner and not greasy. I have used this with the stretch mark cream and together they work wonders! My belly feels so soft and smooth and i have noticed my stretch marks fading already! I have also been using this on my face and i’m impressed..  My skin is glowing and so so soft. The ingredients are wonderful and the scent is very light and clean! I would recommend to all mamas out there and anyone else who could use a bit of extra hydration all over!"

It helps keep my pregnant belly moisturized and soothed, especially with my current stretch marks.  I’m excited to see how much they fade over time."

I’m already seeing those lighten up after a few uses.  An added bonus: I use this on my chest and collar bone and it really helps to brighten and plump the area if you’re wearing a lower cut shirt.  Definitely not just for moms/pregnant girls. It’s a beautiful product for anyone that wants to give some loving to another area but the face and neck!"
