The texture is hydrating without feeling greasy and I can apply it without a lipliner & it doesnu2019t smudge all day. It has way longer lasting power than other lipsticks on the market with similar claims/formulas. Throughout the day it loses its initial shine when you apply it, however I find it lasts longer because of this. The color Dahlia Kiss is absolutely perfect if you love a good warm, peachy nude."

It looks closer to Poppy Kiss from the pictures. I still wear it but I was hoping for the darker red shown."

The fragrance is there but it does go away after a little while.  If the fragrance is bothersome a sort of dupe would be Clinique dramatically different lipstick in bare or innocently..shades 1 or 2.  I think this Guerlain lipstick is wonderful and while giving color coverage it has today's modern look approaching nude shades.  Nude doesn't work for my paler skin tone so this is a great choice for me....nude but with color coverage.  Unfortunately this line could use more pinks in it...a shade brighter, a shade more nude and a really brighter shade of pink.  I think with four or five pinks to choose from it would be helpful for a variety of skin tones.  This is the only shade I have tried so far.  With the price point it is a difficult line to just haphazardly experiment with color and risk disappointment.  MAC cosmetics has a more forgiving price when experimenting with different colors.  This Guerlain lipstick applies smooth as silk and for my dry lips that is a big plus.  It does not look dry at all on and just glides over the lips making application so easy.  I didn't even use lipliner with it.  Just LOVE it!!"

It was very comfortable to wear, buildable pigment, and didnu2019t dry out my lips since itu2019s a balm, but itu2019s not long-lasting for that reason. You will have to reapply. It has almost a satin-like finish, so it wonu2019t be super glossy if thatu2019s what youu2019re looking for. Also, it somehow made my lips look bigger? Iu2019m still shook.
