A truly unisex scent in my opinion. Perfect for fall/winter. I will be repurchasing!"

It's important, however, to note this is a strong/spicy Sandalwood scent and not quite as creamy as described. Unlike many Sandalwood fragrances, you truly smell a bold, spicy Sandalwood from first spray. The rather sweet vanilla, in my opinion, is the base note here and after a few hours becomes the dominant scent. Very close to Atelier's Santal Carmin though if you loved that scent and have been looking for something along those lines. Just know it's a bold scent and with a strong vanilla turn if you're looking for something more sheer, dry or less intense."

I paired this with 7 Virtues Vanilla Woods and they complemented each other beautifully.  Santal Vanille is a beautiful surprise in a world of predictable fragrances."

A very nice creamy sandalwood that is u201cunisexu201d (scents are non-binary) that will smell nice on anyone. Itu2019s warm and rich and pleasant. I got the last travel size at a Sephora near me and the box had been opened but I didnu2019t think much of it. Turns out, the sprayer was loosened perhaps, and I lost quite a bit of product the first time I went to spray this because the sprayer came off. I smelled the box and it was probably leaking inside all the way home. I did learn that these spray bottles are refillable though.

I am obsessed with sandalwood so I am always on a mission to find good fragrances that represent sandalwood well. This product definitely scores pretty highly to me.

This is the perfect sexy warm spicy earthy scent. It is a perfect balance of rustic woody masculine scents and softer warm feminine florals. It has become my go-to scent. I wear it every single day. I love it so much that I stopped rotating my perfumes. This scent is all I need. It is practically perfect in very way. I receive compliments all the time. I highly recommend this scent"

Definitely makes me feel like I am wearing something ancient and unique perhaps from Egypt or India. It is well made. The Sandalwood is a little stronger then the vanilla, especially at first. This scent changes and mixes with my akin perfectly about 15 minutes after I put it on."

Santal Vanille lasted longer and had a stronger scenet than Vanilla Woods as time went on. I could smell initially the Sandalwood but it does calm down and then you smell the Vanilla coconut becomes very clear the longer you wear it. I could smell it on myself for hours after, which has never happened to me with any other fragrance. Vanilla woods is nice too, if you enjoy a hit of florals with vanilla you would enjoy. Santal Vanille is such a unique but sexy fragrance and i find it very versatile. It layers really well with other scents. I really dont see how you can go wrong with this fragrance, I perfer it over Vanilla woods if i had to decide. But i will still continue to use both! They layer well together as well"

This is the scent of a woman who has lived adventurously, ridden horseback in Nepal, climbed sand dunes in Dubai and dined at the top of the Eiffel tower.   I am a fan of warm, vanilla scents, but if you are looking for a safe, sweet, edible vanilla smell this is not that! This is a very earthy, plant-forward composition, that leans into the natural essences of vanilla, and raw coconut wrapped in the spice of myrrh, while sandalwood carries through beneath. When I close my eyes, I think of a woman wearing a backless, black linen dress with an elegantly placed tattoo on her spine and a gold bangle on her arm. She's inviting you in for tea at her effortlessly wabi sabi home.   Like this woman, this fragrance is a bit rough around the edges. That gives it it's mystery, You will be surprised by the strong opening when you spritz, it might even be a bit offensive and masculine to some but, to me it is woody, a bit green, intriguing and very sexy. It dries down into the creamy warm, sweet spicy scent mentioned, that invites you to stay for a second cup of tea... and who know's what after. Smoking hookah in a standalone marble tub?   I love this fragrance because these factors make for a sophisticated vanilla that can be worn by any gender and age. This is not your adolescent, Please like how I smell! body-spray type of vanilla. This is Santal Vanille."

I got myself a small sample of VW through an online order. I really liked it!  I went into my local Sephora to buy a bottle of VW and saw this - actually I saw the word Santal and I flipped because sandalwood is my soul mate. So I ended up buying the bottle of VW and the roller ball of Santal Vanille. I wore the VW every day and itu2019s lovely. But on the days I added on the Santal Vanille OR wore Santal Vanille on its own, everyone asked me what perfume I was wearing and said I smelled u201cdivine, beautiful, sensual, sexy, mysteriousu201d. So I have finally finished the bottle of VW and just ordered a holiday gift set of this Santal Vanille. I smell a small u201cpoofu201d of vanilla in the beginning and then the warmth of the Santal comes through and stays with me all day. I donu2019t think I smell anything else except the smallest amount of vanilla and then sandalwood. I love this. I love it love it. I even wear it to bed!  YSL Libre was my signature. This has taken itu2019s place. I also love the story behind this brand and think itu2019s a wonderful product and company to support.

Big plus for pushing women's  education on environmental causes.  Cruelty free, vegan, hypoallergenic are also huge draws for me. The name itself speaks volumes with Virtues, I'm totally down with the cause.

If you love vanilla based spicy scents, then this is the perfect one for you! I also like how it's a clean formula at sephora.

I don't see many fragrances that are considered clean, so this is great. Now besides that, I don't think this is a gender neutral fragrance. It smells more feminine on me. It also smells way to strongly of vanilla and sandalwood combined. Instead of it being a happy mixture of both scents, it's just too intense. The intensity eventually dies down throughout the day and it starts to smell sweet. A little bit of the rollerball goes a long way. If I liked the smell this would have been perfect since it's clean and lasts a long time. I would still give this 3.5 stars out of 5 mainly because of those reasons I've mentioned."

It is strong, so if you want something light this is not for you. Personally, I love it and this shows me that it will last a long time, which is what I look for in a perfume. It is a bit more of a masculine scent which I do not mind at all, because I don't believe scents need to be gendered... but to describe it it makes sense. It is more of a myrrh and sandalwood scent than a vanilla.. the vanilla is not strong and it is not super sweet. It kind of smells like incense in the best way possible.   I layer this with aveeno body wash and body lotion and it works really well. I spray this once on my back and once on my chest area and the sandalwood lasts on my clothes for a while and it smells amazing!   If you have smelled sandalwood in the real real, it does not smell the same (unless it dries down on your clothes... then you can definitely smell it), but it does not smell artificial either. I think because it is mixed with the myrrh and vanilla, you are smelling them altogether, obviously! :P  This scent gives me a walking through a Moroccan (or Abu Dhabi, etc) vibe. It is also sophisticated.    10/10 recommended if you like the smell of sandalwood and vanilla :)"
