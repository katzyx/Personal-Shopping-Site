It does have a funky smell, and it does linger a bit, but it\u2019s worth it! It\u2019s pretty much unavoidable with these ingredients.   It also took about a month to start seeing results.

The only thing I don\u2019t like about it is the way to open the product when you first get it. There should be an easier way to open it such as having a tab to peel off or something.

I noticed my skin is brighter, and more even than ever! My skin did purge for maybe 2-3 weeks but I pushed through that. Some people complain that it broke them out after one use and it's your skin purging not necessarily an allergic reaction but it is hard to tell the two apart. When introducing a new product especially one like this your skin will react to it.   I will be purchasing again and even bigger one too! I will say there is a big price difference between the website and app. App says the mini is $24.50 and the Sephora website says different. There needs to be a change in the app to match the website or I will purchase directly from Topicals myself."

After a few weeks of using the Faded serum, I am feeling so much more confident about my skin. I stopped using other acids in my routine because this stuff is really good at exfoliating without drying. My skin is smoother and my dark spots are finally fading! The smell is odd, but the benefits outweigh it by far. My skin plays nicely with acids, so I use this both morning and night. But I would definitely recommend starting out slow if you have sensitive skin. I also recommend using a moisturizer with ceramide and other skin barrier protecting ingredients."

I feel if you want faster results, it best to added more hyperpigmentation targeting products to your routine. I exfoliate and use retinol 2x a week which probably also helped to. I don't just rely on faded. But, it is great and pairs well with my peach slices snail mucin toner and good molecules brightening toner."

AS for the smell, no it doesn't smell great but all the complaining about it is WAY overblown. It smells like sulfur, You put it on and it goes away. I'd rather it be a little stinky than loaded with sensitizing fragrances and essential oils that only cause irritation and make things worse.

This product has THE WORST SMELL I have ever put on my face. I expected some sort of smell based on other reviews, but it literally smelled like nasty wet cat food. Just awful. And the packing is just as terrible. It's impractical and wasteful!! When I first started using it, product would just POUR out without any control. I literally lost SO much product because there was no way of stopping it. Then once you start getting towards the end of product use, it's impossible to get product out without creating HOLES IN THE PACKAGING. They need to rethink packaging at minimum, but truly there are better products out there for acne scars, dark spots and textures. It's way pricier, but the U Beauty Resurfacing serum is going to do the same, if not more, for your skin, last just as long if not longer, and won't come with so many downsizes (prices really being the only one).

At the same time, it\u2019s causing me to break out more which leads to more hyperpigmentation in the future. My skin usually isn\u2019t very sensitive so at first I was using this every other day but that was a horrible idea. That gave me small chemical burns and my skin was so raw, dry, and stung all day. I won\u2019t fault them for that cause the directions do say to start off with it once a week but I was impatient and saw other people say their skin did well with everyday use right off the bat and I thought I could do the same. I focused on hydration for a while to restore my skin barrier and then incorporated it back into my routine once a week and I\u2019m still having similar issues. I used this product the same night after plucking my brows during the day (I only plucked like 3 hairs) and woke up with a bunch of little white dots all around my eyebrow. They went away in a two days but it was nasty looking. Then I applied this a little too close to my ear since I have hyperpigmentation on my jawline and now my earlobe and behind my ear has the same little white spots and it\u2019s lasted for days now. It stings too. And my nose seems to be the most sensitive part of my face cause it\u2019s gotten really dry, and started peeling a lot. If you\u2019re gonna try this product, make sure your skin barrier is already healthy and use a very small amount. I\u2019d also recommend going to sleep with a sealant on (Cerave healing ointment is great). Not a horrible product but a product you definitely need to be VERY careful with. Although it\u2019s helped with my dark spots, I feel it\u2019s not worth it for me and that there\u2019s definitely more gentle products on the market that will help with my dark spots. Wouldn\u2019t recommend but I wouldn\u2019t discourage anyone from trying either because everyone\u2019s skin is different! Just be very careful with any acids."

Although my skin is sensitive and oily, I used the serum nightly after about 1 week, and did not experience any issues. I believe this is a good product for Black skin. In the beginning the rancid smell was bad, but you get used to it after a while, and I believe the odor dissipates the longer you use it.

I\u2019ve been using this product for about 2 years now and I can definitely agree with everyone it has a really bad smell. It\u2019s also true that this causes breakouts at the start, but the more consistently you use it the better it gets. I\u2019ve been doing skin cycling with this product because I\u2019m scared to use retinol, but I have really dry skin so before putting this product on I make sure to have my hyaluronic acids on before I put this on my skin. Then if it still feels particularly dry afterwards I go in with a heavy cream like vanicream to ensure that the moisturizer stays locked and so do the active products. I know at first it can break you out and stuff but, keep trying it for a month at least before throwing it out. I promise it does make a difference. I used to have really bad acne marks but this product has helped out a lot! I would like to mention I only use this at night. During the day I use a vitamin C and sunscreen!"

I no longer have clogged pores and I may get an occasional pimple but now I also have a lot of scares that I've never had before. I was using this serum with another serum and I kept breaking out and I thought it was this product but come to find out, it was the other product. Now I use this product along with my other skin regimen, no problem at all. I've been using it for a week and I am already seeing results. i know it will take time but this works. Yes, it has a weird smell but it doesn't last long. The only negative thing i have to say is the packing. I with they would put it in a pump or something or even change the tube material because it gets wrinkle and then it's hard to get product out. I'll keep using it for at least 3 months. Hope to see significant results by then."

Yes it has a strong smell but I personally got past it very fast as it settles into the skin quick. I haven't noticed a crazy change with hyperpigmentation, but it is a savior for acne. I've had acne prone skin my whole life and I swear using this at night makes zits disappear by the next morning (or at least reduce in size). It is magic. HOWEVER, the tube packaging is not great. Because of the material it's made with, when it's bent, the tube can actually crack open and form little holes where product escapes. This happened when I traveled the first time with it. So anytime I squeeze product to come out where it's actually supposed to, it also comes out in the little cracks on the tube where it has broken open. So much wasted product and then the product isn't as fresh. I ordered a new one despite this, and when I opened it a TON of product came gushing out that I obviously couldn't use at one time so there was more waste there, again I think due to the tube packaging. This is the best product but PLEASEEEE fix this!!!! I want to keep buying without wasting so much!"

I bought the mini version (15ml) and have been using it more consistently since July and I'm not even halfway there. I use about to pea-size amounts. - Reduced the size of my pores, particularly around my nose area = smoother skin.  - Gentle on the skin. I would attribute that to the Centella Asiatica and the Niacinamide. I used it once a week for 3 weeks. Now I use it every other day and it hasn't made my sensitive skin flare up. - My acne scars are diminished due to the mix of tranexamic acid, azelaic acid, licorice root, and kojic acid. I had a really painful pimple on my cheek and I used this throughout the process of it growing and now it's nice and flat. The colour of the pimple went from pink to red to brownish-red and now beige.   Cons: - The smell. For me it isn't a bother, but I can see why others would be hesitant to use it if you're sensitive to smells. It smells like Sulfur and I've associated it with my old dog so it feels comforting for me.   Don't expect rapid results. Keep it consistent, as you should for all products anyway. There are definitely similar versions for cheaper, but the fact that the key ingredients are near the top of the list , it's gentle, and it works just make this product worth it. I highly recommend buying the small version to try it out first."

I have lots if knicks & scrapes that have healed & left dark spots. I was excited to use this as I've heard so many great things but I haven't had results at all. It hasn't broke me out but the smell is so nasty. It reminds me of a smelly old poopy diaper. I don't like the metal tube it comes in because serum leaks out if the tube while I'm rubbing in the serum. I'll continue using until the tube I have until it's finished & if I notice results & change my mind I will update this review. I wont be re-purchasing."

Even though it smells kinda funny (I actually like the smell for some weird reason) it feels and IS potent. A little goes a long way (which is why I recommend getting the mini because you don't need much) and I put it on every night that I'm not using BHAs and AHAs and wake up to soft and brightened skin. It does take a bit of time to see results but thats to be expected from any kind of scar treatment. This and the CosRx Spot treatment are my go-to's when it comes to healing and dealing with scars!

After finally \u201caging out\u201d of the horrible acne and not having a mass breakout in years, I started my dark spot treatment. I have tried numerous products and have paid a lot for expensive creams from dermatologist with no luck. I did a lot of research on Faded and was super excited to purchase.   I started using Faded after my serum & before my moisturizer in my skin care routine (applying sunscreen in the morning routine).  The first thing I noticed, was the smell. It is strong but I wasn\u2019t bothered.  After just one use, my face was tingly, like a lemon was applied to it. Tolerable. I remember my dermatologist used to tell me new products take time to work so be consistent.  Day 2: I noticed a few small pimples on my chin where I had applied the product on an old acne scar. After washing my face in the pm, I noticed a a pimple on my cheek.  Day 3: I woke up on the third day of using Faded with my cheeks covered in small, nasty pimples.   I had not changed anything else in my routine or lifestyle expect adding Faded. I immediately stopped use of this product and the acne cleared up within a few days.  I have had no new breakouts since but the dark scars the breakout left are so disheartening:(  My self esteem is (still) crushed and I was completely devastated with the new acne scars I had worked so hard for years to get rid of. Because of Faded. I\u2019m starting all over on my goal to have my scars faded.  I read another review posted the day after I bought my Faded saying the product seemed different in than usual and they broke out, too. My only confirmed allergen I was not an ingredient listed so I am still unsure as to what broke me out in this product.  My advice: be careful! Read the ingredients if you have may have any allergies and check with your dermatologist to see if this would work for you. Don\u2019t make my mistake!"

I will at least say if this product does indeed work for your skin, then a tube of this lasts for a long time and it's a good bang for your buck.  I also wondered if I should use it someplace else not near my face where I couldn't smell it as much and tried using it to lighten some ingrown hair scars. Annnnnd...nope, still doesn't work.

And lastly it pills really bad, probably the reason as to why I haven\u2019t seen any results, the product doesn\u2019t seem to penetrate the skin, it just sits on top until it dries and then it flakes off.

If you're not sensitive to smells or the smell somehow doesn't bother you, you might not have this problem. I'm bummed I couldn't get over the smell because I really love the texture of this product. I had previously used the Ordinary's azelaic acid really like the product overall, but wasn't the biggest fan of the texture so I tried this because it's more of serum consistency.

I have melasma on my forehead from years of tanning and not wearing SPF when I was young and ignorant, and I often get little dark marks from hormonal acne breakouts that take forever to fade . My skin is thick, I have large pores, some black heads on my nose and my skin is oily. I've been using a Benzoyl Peroxide/Retin A treatment called Tactupump Forte for quite some time to control my breakouts and I use it nightly. I wear SPF every single day. My skin can handle exfoliating or acid products pretty well. I jumped into Faded head first and applied it every night for 2 days without Tactupump Forte but applied them together every night afterwards. I know my skin and I knew I would not have any issues - I know what signs to look for if the product started to irritate my skin. I had no issues using Faded every night. The treatment is quite thick so I apply it last before my night time moisturizer. It does have a strong sulphuric smell which honestly doesn't bother me, I'd rather something like this treatment  NOT fragranced. After 2 weeks of consistent use, to my shock and surprise, Faded has already started to work. I've been trying so much to even out my skin tone to no avail; I know products that lighten dark marks take time to work and I do set appropriate expectations. This is the only product that has delivered results within the mentioned timeframe and I am impressed. Additionally, my texture has become softened and I wake up with baby soft skin. To say I am obsessed is an understatement!"

            "review_text": "this product has helped with my skin a lot, for reference a 24 year old light skinned Latina with a terrible skin picking habit, my acne only really got bad during my period but then I got random huge under the skin zits on/off my period. When I wouldn\u2019t pop them it would still leave a dark spot. I also would get those little annoying bumps on my forehead and sometimes nose. Tried everything to help my skin heal from the damage I have done to it for years, until I stumbled upon this product. I didn\u2019t really see real big results until almost 6 months in. By 3 months tho I saw a few changes, my smaller dark spots faded away completely and no more little bumps also WEAR SUNSCREEN. Really helps you see results faster honestly just stay out of the sun completely. I see a lot of comments about the smell it\u2019s not that bad for a while I didn\u2019t really smell anything until I really took a whiff.I gave up on it a few times because I was impatient but trust the process and keep using it, yes I know it made u break out and face worse but trust the process it\u2019s all worth it. Probably feels like you have been using it forever and still see nothing. Been there. I love my skin!! I\u2019ve never seen my skin so good. When you pass that purging phase and ur skin has finally settled and is taking in the amazing ingredients it\u2019s gods work. Marks fading, no more huge zits and my face just looks brighter. Even during my period I don\u2019t break out like crazy I actually don\u2019t get anymore pimples. I don\u2019t want to say acne free but acne free. This product has truly saved my skin so good I don\u2019t even mind spending 40$ on it. Give it a chance it might just change ur skin forever 2"

It is also one of the only products that don't seem to irritate my skin. If it's your first time using this, I would definitely suggest starting off using it slowly; maybe once or twice a week max until your skin can take it every day. I personally do not mind the smell; it isn't anything repulsive. The one thing I wish they could fix is the packaging. This is a very unforgiving tube, so you have to be more strategic than usual when using it. Topicals does sell something on their website to help with dispensing this more evenly, but I haven't tried it yet to say if it's good or not.  FYI: I have combo, oily and acne-prone skin."

Centella provides soothing, and shea butter, jojoba oil, coconut oil, and glycerin hydrate. There are no added fragrances or dyes, but it does have that salty smell that I associate with some vitamin C products, although that dissipates quickly. The texture is creamy, which initially worried me, but to my shock it did not clog my pores at all, and it caused no irritation. After using the serum for a few weeks, I can definitely tell that my post-acne marks are fading (ha!), and at a faster rate than normal. This serum would be great for folks with dry skin, or dehydrated skin like me."

I always wake up with a soft, refreshed, and brightened face. I used up my first tube in 2022 after about 6 months of applying a dime sized amount of serum all over my face nightly. It lightened my acne scars and made them appear pink before fading away.   For transparencies sake, I also use SPF 50 every day. By my 2nd tube, I began to include other active ingredients/skin barrier protecting products intermittently to accommodate eczema flare ups and acne breakouts. I recommend using a paint tube key to best dispense the product."

After using it for a couple of weeks, I noticed that my dark spots, redness, and acne and blemishes had begun to lighten and even out my skin tone. The key ingredients, tranexamic acid, niacinamide, and azelaic acid, work together to reduce discoloration and address post-acne marks.

Two, the results are actually great. I don\u2019t use this by itself so my skin results in almost two months are probably contributed by the effects of my other products as well, but as this product is for dark spot and discoloration, it has done it\u2019s thing on that! It\u2019s only been a month and some change (almost two in a week and few days) and my skin is already brighter & there are spots that are fading. It says to use once a week and then build up using it daily, but I got a lil\u2019 impatient. It started off as me using it once for two weeks, then started using it day and night every time I do my AM & PM skin routine. Anyways yeah, besides the smell.. I got no complaints. I took the picture the same place, same lighting. Only difference is when I first took the pic in March, my face isn\u2019t moisturized.   Here\u2019s the rest of my skin routine, if anybody is interested (:  1.) Good Molecules Clarify & Cleanse Bar Soap (Cleanser) 2.) Healov\u2019s Tumeric Face Wash Liquid (Cleanser)  3.) Good Molecules Niacinamide Brightening Toner (Toner) 4.) First Aid Beauty Ultra Repair Cream (Moisturizer) 5.) Faded Tropicals (Serum) 6.) TheInkeyList Omega Water Cream (Moisturizer) 7.) Mel\e Face Moisturizer with SPF (Sunscreen)  Those are the items for both my AM & PM routine. the PM is the same as AM just without the sunscreen (7).   It seems like a lot (and i\u2019m not sure if it is, prolly cus I double cleanse), but it\u2019s def worth it and works for my skin. The sunscreen is a DEF recommended though for melanated skin."

I have one splotch in each cheek. Before turning to spots they were two large bruise looking scabs and me being me I peeled off the scabs making them larger, more painful, bloody, and take forever to heal. I tried everything from aloe Vera, to aquophor, to Ambi fade cream and these things worked but slowly and they didn\u2019t really do what I needed. I discovered good molecules and I owe my life to their discoloration serum and brightening toner. I\u2019ve even incorporated their retinol and pineapple exfoliate in my routine and these products have done SO MUCH for my skin. These products did most of the heavy lifting in fading my dark spots.   2: fast forward to earlier this month. My products have been working fine but I felt like they weren\u2019t powerful enough to fully fade my spots. They were still visible and I really just wanted them to go away. I\u2019ve been stalking so to speak faded by topicals for months but I kept shying away because I heard things about it breaking people out. I finally decided that I was just going to have to take the risk because the results I kept seeing were amazing. I bought it and started using it last Monday.  3. Today is Sunday so tomorrow will make 1 week of me using it. To minimize irritation I cut my routine down to cleansing and spf in the morning ( with STRICT reapplication) and cleansing, faded andmoisturizer at night. I didn\u2019t follow the instructions and I know I definitely took a risk with that but I\u2019ve been so desperate. I used it every night. I did get a mini breakout but it calmed down pretty fast 4: So far I see a HUGEEEEE difference. At this rate, I think they\u2019ll be 90% gone in two weeks. I\u2019m going to update my review."

After 5 minutes, it was immediately gone. Product: Be patient!! It takes time of course but it will be noticeable. The only thing is please only use a little.

I got my faded serum just right now and I immediately opened it and spread it on my hand to see how it smells because of how many bad comments that are on here relentlessly ranting talking ish about the smell. And when I tell you everyone is over exaggerating I mean THEIR OVER-EXAGGERATING, this product doesn\u2019t smell like tulips and fresh strawberries BUT it certainly doesn\u2019t smell like harsh chemical throw up that will burn your nose hairs. In addition, this won\u2019t even give off a strong smell to someone laying right next to you unless they are right in your face sniffing your skin which I hope y\u2019all ain\u2019t doing that. \ud83d\ude02 I\u2019m just stunned at how bad people think this smells, I would even go as far to say as I like the unnoticeable neutral scent it has because it\u2019s a very normal cream scent and dried up in a matter of minutes very nicely with little stickiness. Anyways though, I\u2019ll have a real honest update about this in about 3 months, I currently have a lot of red & purpley brown hyperpigmentation from my acne so we\u2019ll see."

I found that this doesn\u2019t clear or fade my redness/PIH as quickly as other products. I can get past the smell of the product really works. I also think this isn\u2019t good for acne prone skin, as it has shea butter as the 7th ingredient. I love that it has TXA and licorice root but I do think this has added to my breakouts therefor cancelling out and effects it had on fading spots on my face. I will probably not repurchase as I can\u2019t risk this continuing to break me out. Maybe this will work better for someone who doesn\u2019t have acne prone skin."

Moreover, the spots have faded significantly that they are almost non-perceptible. Cons are: horrible musty smell and not openly listing the % of the actives such as tranexamic acid, azelaic, kojic, etc. but I was able to find a report of it elsewhere online.

I have very sensitive skin so this does not irritate or burn my skin ( I have oily skin). I understand the smell can be intense but nothing I personally can't handle. It smells like nair.

It does seem to take time and consistent use (duh?). I will say, manage your expectations. This, alongside a good skincare routine will most likely improve your skin. I still have a ways to go til I see more progress. I'm not ruling it out. Also, the elephant in the room will be your skin. The scent seems to aim for floral/natural with an overwhelming dollop of sulphur. It isn't as bad as everyone says and if you put it on before bed, it doesn't matter anyway."

Not a product flaw at all it's just the way it is unless you want it doused in fragrance. It is a very active-filled product is what I am trying to say!

Rub it into your skin, and the smell, for the most part, dissipates with it. I normally put moisturizer and sunscreen on top of this and the smell is barely there. Not sure why everyone makes a big deal about it.   Overall, it's worth the price, the hype and it does what it says."

The smell has grown on me and now I weirdly like the scent - it's hard to describe. The packaging is also not ideal for this product. It's a thinner viscosity than the type of products that are usually in aluminum squeeze tubes, so too much comes out and it dries in the cap. I wish it were a thicker cream for the price so I could use less. On the plus side, this list of ingredients in this is fantastic, and it does work about as well as a non-rx dark-spot treatment can. Tranexamic acid and these type of ingredients work best when used consistently over time and work well to prevent redness/dark spots before they occur as well as treat hyperpigmentation."

I am not seeing dramatic results yet though, I have dark eye circles and some freckles high on the cheeks, and some post pimples marks on my jaw. none of these discolourations have lightened so far after 2 months of almost daily use. but because the ingredients are so good and well researched, I just bought the full sized tube again. I am hoping I will see results in 4 months.  Re the smell that some find offensive, is not overpowering. the smell. while medicinal is not headache triggering or nauseating like perfumed creams are. I am actually highly sensitive to artificial smells and get nauseous and dizzy around strong perfumes, but this cream is absolutely fine with me.

The scabs turned into dark scars because my skin is super fair and everything turns into a scar on me apparently. I've been using the faded cream for a 2-3 weeks and they've gotten so much lighter I think they'll be hardly noticeable in another 2 weeks. I originally got a small tube in a boxycharm and forgot about it until the hanni incident. I came back for the larger tube after buying the spray, which left orange splotches all over.  Anyways, this stuff works. I use it every day after I shower and I highly recommend it. Also I'm sticking with waxing these days \ud83d\ude42"

I was on rx hydroquinone and every vitamin c serum I could find including skinceuticals and everything in between, and nothing worked! Hydroquinone works with time but it also dries & irritates, so while your on it you don\u2019t see much happening. *Topicals faded* erraticated a bunch of bad breakouts due to trying new products & 8 red/purple spots in about 4 days. People definitely over exaggerate the scent. It has the scent of sulfur like 4 days after a perm. It\u2019s faint and goes away after a minute & leaves a scent that is amazing! So amazing I was smelling everywhere trying to figure out what it was lol. I\u2019m so glad I didn\u2019t pass on it based on bad reviews. The closest thing I can compare the scent to is head and shoulders dandruff shampoo and if your constantly using sulfur products like me\u2026 It won\u2019t phase you. I love that it applies seamlessly and I can use it over my vitamin c and under my serums without pilling AND it doesn\u2019t burn. This stuff is chok full of amazing ingredients. The only thing comparable is peace out skin dark spot serum but that\u2019s not the best choice for trentinoin users with sensitized skin. If you give this a chance and let the scent subside you will definitely see good results. I have acne prone, sensitive, sensitized Tretinoin, combination skin prone to hyperpigmentation and hormonal acne monthly. I\u2019m 35 years old, & this worked wonders for me. I will never ever not have this in my collection, it\u2019s my new holy grail treatment. I can use it for breakouts, it makes my pores look smaller & keeps them clear. I\u2019ve noticed my skin is more firm and the texture is so smooth. I honestly wouldn\u2019t change anything about this serum. You only need a tiny amount because it\u2019s a perfect consistency and spreadable texture so the price is great, especially for the ingredients you get. This is a do all serum. Between this and like butter I don\u2019t need much else."

I recently heard from a dermatologist about the benefits of the individual ingredients in this, and I just happened to have this on hand. I usually get small blemishes and have acne scars/hyperpigmentation and texture. All of it has improved with this product. It definitely has a funky smell (kinda smells like turkey to me!) but it doesn\u2019t persist. I have combination skin but more on the oily side. It\u2019s even helped with oil control throughout the day (I use it in the morning with a sunscreen). If you need an alternative to retinols/vitamin c give this a try. I use it a few times a week."

I have some freckles around my eyes and forehead that have lightened up A LOT since I started using this. Mind you, I do use retinol as well but I've been using that for like 2 years now and the biggest change on my skin happened after I started using this. I use this at night (alternating nights w retinol).   Cons: smell is pretty bad as everyone has said but you get used to it. The first time I used it I couldn't handle it but now I am used to it. The smell does fade (gets milder; doesn't go away) after a few minutes. Another con is that it is drying my skin. I notice the difference during the day time the following day as my skin feels very dry. Because of that I am not sure if I would be able to use it in the winter.   So far, pretty great. 4.5 stars (-0.5 bc of bad smell and drying effect)."

It does have niaciimide which gives me white heads, but it works so well to lighten my dark spots i dont mind. The smell is not that good, but once you put it on you cant really smell it anymore so it doesnt matter too much. Will definitely be buying again. Only issue is the tube is very unforgiving and product tends to spill out and gather around the top which is kind of annoying because of how expensive the product is you end up wasting a bit of it."

I've been really self-conscious about it and have been considering laser treatment. This serum seems to have made a huge difference in the time that I've been using it over the past few weeks. My cheeks are even and actually glowing now? Who would have thought. I'm looking at cancelling my laser appointment and waiting to see if the results hold up. I'm so pleased with this product.  I also don't think the smell is that bad, at all. I braced myself when I opened the tube, thinking it would be horrific based on other comments, but it was .. fine? I definitely have used other products that I thought were smellier. I actually considered taking a rapid test because I thought maybe there was something wrong with my smell, but I think it just doesn't bother me as much.

However, if a product delivers results and does what it says it does, I don\u2019t care what it smells like! I will bathe in it! I live in FL and was a sun bunny in my teens, so I have some sun damage across my cheeks, bridge of my nose and upper lip, including some melasma brought on by hormones- so pretty much all over- all of which has been there for the last 20 years (for reference Im fair-skinned and mid 30\u2019s). And let me tell you\u2014 ALL of that is nearly gone and this is the most even skin tone I have had in the last two decades. My stubborn melasma is SIGNIFICANTLY lighter and shrinking. I am shocked at how well this works! I had a solid routine before, but when I added this serum into the rotation, it was a game changer. I have been using this consistently for the last 4 months at night 2x/wk alongside Tretinoin 2x/wk, and Vitamin C or Caudalie\u2019s vinoperfect serum in the mornings (and a good SPF, of course). The sun damage on my nose and upper lip is completely gone and the areas on my cheeks have shrunk and lightened by 70%.  I know this is marketed more towards acne and PIH sufferers, but if you have deep, long-standing hyperpigmentation issues, this one is for you too! Hope this helps."

I have been using this for a few months, I started with once a week and have built up usage to every night and it has done wonders for my hyperpigmentation. I found that most hyperpigmentation products ive used before tend to work on only new spots but have a harder time treating deeper marks. While it takes a little more consistency, this product reaches those longtime spots and even my partner has seen them fade significantly. The only reason why I give this product 4/5 stars is because the smell (which lingers and is horrible) and the packaging which gets bent and mishapen super easily. These two things can be easily forgiven as I have been struggling with acne and hyperpigmentation for most of my life and this is the first product that has made me believe that clear skin might one day be a possibility for me."

Also bought like butter and I love that too but Faded needed a review. If you are on the fence, get the smaller tube. That\u2019s what I did and I still have a decent amount left after using it twice a day. But get a tube key."

As for the results, I\u2019ve always had acne. At 29 I still had hormonal acne. I now only wash my face, use this product then use lotion before bed. This got rid of my acne, except for those random period pimples now. And my scars started to fade within two weeks. My light \u201cnew\u201d scars started to fade immediately and I was extremely impressed. My skin texture also just looks healthier after using this on a semi regular basis. Now I\u2019m working on those pesky old scars from when I was a teenager and threw 3 pregnancies when I had severe acne. I\u2019m going onto my second tube and hoping it keeps working, slowly but surely the deep dark scars are fading!"

For me it\u2019s tolerable and based on the impact I\u2019m noticing it\u2019s worth it. Discoloration needs chemical help (if you do peels or other in office treatments) none of that stuff smells good either. This stuff is legit. I personally get away with the smaller size.

My under arm skin is thick and the darkness is BAD. Now for any of you struggling with the same, I want to disclaim that though this helped a bit, it didn\u2019t work miracles. After 3 months of consistent use, I decided to see my derm and got started on hydroquinone (which I\u2019d recommend over this, but if you can\u2019t get a prescription for that, this is a great alternative). I\u2019ve loved using this during the periods where I take a break from hydroquinone. It does a great job and never causes a bit of irritation. If you combine this with Adapalene, you\u2019ll get even better results. If you struggle with something like acanthosis, see a dermatologist. If you can\u2019t get into seeing one, this will give you results, but it doesn\u2019t work miracles overnight if that\u2019s what you are expecting. Be consistent and patient.

I must say this is a fantastic product, it has tons of great ingredients (Tranexamic Acid, licorice, Niacinamide, and Azelaic Acid) - all that address discoloration and Azelaic acid helps to prevent future sun damage. I use it twice per day, in the AM, after my vitamin C serum and before sunscreen, and in the PM, after retin A and before my moisturizer. In less than two weeks, I've already seen great results. For best results, you MUST use an SPF every day, or the dark spots will return. I would have given it four stars but as other reviewers have mentioned, it stinks. The closest comparison I can think of is the old-fashioned perm solution, it has that kind of smell. It dissipates after a few minutes, but it's pretty stinky."

It also really improved my skins texture which I didn\u2019t even realize was a problem until it was gone. Everytime I happen to touch my face I\u2019m blown away by how soft it is now.   Faded smells really bad but once you start seeing results you stop caring it\u2019s just becomes worth it. Oh and I owe at least part of the success of this product to diligent suncare, sunscreen everyday and reapplied often and all that good stuff. It really truly makes a difference and this stinky stuff has won my heart."

            "review_text": "Overall Experience: I recently had a big cyst on my chin that left a dark red/purple dime-sized spot. I scar super easily and I'm prone to keloids. I bought this to try out and it is absolutely working. After three weeks, it's about half the size it used to be and it's continuing to fade! I truly think it's going to go away completely. I'm applying it on old acne scars and even a burn scar but I'm not sure if it's working yet.  Smell: It smells horrible. It's the worst smelling skin care product I've ever bought. I make sure to wash my hands after using it. The smell does fade after awhile. I definitely wait a few hours before getting in bed since I don't want it on my sheets. Dealing with the smell is worth it though.  How I'm Using It: I use it at night after washing my face with YTP Superfood Cleanser. I use Thayer's Witch Hazel toner. (Before you discredit me for my toner choice, I know about the phenoxyethanol. I tried a bunch of other toners after they added it. My skin hated everything else and when I switched back my skin was happy again. I don't know. I'm okay with it.) I rub it in and wait until it dries. I moisturize with YTP Superfood Air-Whip Cream then follow up with their Dream Oil once in awhile. I've never experienced any pilling. The instructions say to use it once a week and work up to daily. I'm no beginner to retinol, AHAs, BHAs, etc., so I just jumped right to using it every day and I was fine. No peeling, burning, or redness. Make sure to wear sunscreen every day.  We all know that products like this are hit or miss. Everyone's results are different. I think this is worth spending the $18 on the mini to try out because if you're someone it works for, it really does help. If this doesn't end up working for you, at least you tried."

I preferred the older formulation over the new one, because when I wash my face I can still smell it!! The scent is like cheap-classic grandma perfume masking the original formulation, and it's headache inducing!! As far as the efficacy of the product 4.5/5 stars.

I used to work in skincare for years and have no aversion to bad smelling products, but this product is putrid beyond anything I\u2019ve ever smelled or used before. The reviews on here aren\u2019t lying about how bad it smells. I put it on, forgot I did a few hours later, and walked around my house thinking that my dog had pooped in the floor somewhere. But it was only just this product sitting on my face. I can\u2019t believe they couldn\u2019t put some sort of fragrance or ingredient to block the smell because this is like smelling a trash can full of old chicken rotting in the hot summer sun. I\u2019m going to give it a full two weeks to see if the smell is something I can get over if this product does actually work, but man Topicals really needs to work on the stench of this."

At first it smells a bit like nair hair removal cream and then a bit like chicken afterwards but once it is on your face you cannot smell a thing and I feel like all of these reviews about the smell have you heating up for the worst but it is really not that strong. At first when I opened the tube I couldn\u2019t even smell anything, it has a SLIGHT smell to it so if you are very sensitive to smells you may not like it but I think all the reviews are very misleading about the degree of smell it has.  Overall this product is awesome, not irritating, feels great on the skin, and minimized the look of my pores after one day of using it. I love it and highly recommend!

Whenever I do facial extractions I\u2019m always left with so much redness, some marks from shqueezin\u2019 -you know the drill. Its disgusting, I know, and I have nobody to blame but myself.  But let me tell you- this stuff? heaven sent.  Redness and marks GONE OVERNIGHT. Not only that- it brightens. I put this on my hoohah too because I have slightly darker pigmentation down there and my god -that\u2019s working too. Slowly down there for some reason, but I am seeing results. I\u2019m currently doing laser hair removal down there and before I started using this cream the laser machine light didn\u2019t reach all the way in certain areas that were darker. But after sticking with this stuff every night, the machine go ahead light has been going up a few notches.  So - dark underarms or other areas of the face or body that are hyper-pigmented, try this but remember a little goes a long way!!  TIP : I would HIGHLY recommend to use something fragrant over this because the smell is so unappealing. Glo Recipe watermelon or neutrogena hydroboost gel worked to mask the smell for me. But, if you don\u2019t want to spend a fortune on fragranced moisturizer try Aveeno stress relief lotion on top of this product."

It does not fade on me, so I\u2019ll usually pair it with moisturizers that have a slight fragrance to them. What I don\u2019t know: whether it\u2019s truly effective at fading hyperpigmentation. Scars fade naturally on their own, so i can\u2019t say for sure whether the scars I\u2019ve had faded because of this product, or because of the timing, or because of other products I use when I\u2019m not using this (e.g. retinol or vitamin c).

I\u2019ve only been using this sparingly for about a month; we\u2019ll see!

But ladies, I found two good alternatives I've been using if this doesn't work. 1. alpha arbutin +HA. Let me tell you this works soo good ! Also, use the TXA from Inky list which also helped reduce dark spots!"

All anyone ever talks about when referencing this product is how awful it smells. But truthfully, when I went to put it on my face for the first time it was a little anti-climactic. Meaning, I was prepared for something that smelled terrible and it just wasn\u2019t that bad. And then when I used it for the second time I smelled it again because I thought \u201cOK, maybe it was just at one time\u201d but the second time it didn\u2019t smell that bad either. Now, I\u2019m not saying there isn\u2019t a smell because there is but it\u2019s just not as awful as everyone is making it out to be. And once you layer your other products on it you can\u2019t even smell it. Don\u2019t let the smell be the reason you don\u2019t get this product.

I used Retin-A for anti-aging for 2 years but stopped 3 months ago because I think I did a number on my moisture barrier.   I started out using Faded every 2-3 days for the first 2 weeks. I had no irritation or breakouts. I now use it 5-6 days a week and my skin looks the best it has in awhile. My PIE has faded (not totally gone, but enough that I stopped wearing foundation and now just use a bit of concealer); my skin is glowing; and my forehead lines seem to have softened (but that could be due, in part, to the fact that my moisture barrier is no longer compromised).   I believe I have the reformulated version - it has a distinct smell - but it\u2019s not bad at all. I\u2019m really surprised at how effective Faded seems to be, while also being non-irritating. I\u2019ve recently learned that my skin loves niacinamide - I use TO\u2019s 10% serum in the morning and Faded at night. It\u2019s been a great combo for me."

When acne forms a whitehead, I slap a pimple patch on it (while using BPO or BHA) until the pus is no longer an issue. Then, I use faded on it during the healing process :) Makes for much less problems dealing with hyperpigmentation caused by acne. A little bit goes a long way as well, so you get good value for the price. People complain about the smell, and it is noticeable-- but I let it dry down and wash my hands before applying the rest of my products. I don't notice a lingering smell that way."

On their site and here on Sephora, it lists coconut oil; nowhere to be found on the box though. Also on the box, some of the things that are supposed to be helpful - azelaic acid, kojic acid, alpha arbutin - are listed AFTER shea butter and jojoba oil...This whole thing leaves a bad taste in my mouth for $46.

And trust me I know because I would use hydrocortisone for dark spots both 2% hydrocortisone and 4% hydrocortisone and this works better than both. My overall skin is extremely smooth which is blowing my mind. If you are a black woman with hyperpigmentation stubborn dark spots I would say 100% purchase this product ASAP!

I\u2019ve struggled with hyperpigmentation every time I get a pimple no matter what. It\u2019s got a PERFECT combination of powerful ingredients that I\u2019ve already tried in the past but I love how this product combined the best.

As some have mentioned the smell is not great but having used other products for pigmentation, like the Differin Hydroquinoine gel, it seems to be a trend with this kind of product. It's not off-putting enough that it bothers me. Ultimately you're looking at a choice between a product that really works, or a slightly unpleasant smell. I'll take the product that works every time. Only complaint would be the packaging, it can be a bit wasteful as it sometimes dispenses too much which often happens with this type of metal tube packaging, something with a pump might be nice but isn't a dealbreaker."

I have never used a product with azelaic acid before so maybe that is the smell? I\u2019m not sure.

On Topicals Instagram, they stated that you should NOT be using this product in the same routine as your exfoliants (BHA, AHA, etc) and retinoids. I wouldn\u2019t have known that have I not gone on their Instagram and checked their highlights in regards to this product. They also provide more information about the product on their own website.

It does stink in the tube but once applied to my face I don\u2019t notice it and neither does my husband.  It doesn\u2019t work (in my experience) for established sun spots/freckles but generally OTC topicals don\u2019t.  This product doesn\u2019t break me out and I actually feel it helps with my acne. So overall extremely happy I found this product!"

Yes, product has a strong odor but have fair skin with dark pigmentation from acne scars all over my face and this product has dramatically reduced their appearance in just one week with consistent use.  Who cares how it smells? Are you going to eat it? The smell immediately fades and it WORKS. I used other high end, expensive serums, and they did not work. I wanted to give up. But this worked. I am blown away and so grateful.   Make sure to use this product on clean, exfoliated skin, AM and PM, for best results."

I\u2019ve been using this product on my dark marks and under my eyes for a little over a month now and I see a huge difference. My skin is way more even and a vast majority of my marks have lightened significantly. I promise you I swear by this product. Some people complain about how awful the smell is but in my opinion it\u2019s an over exaggeration. It really isn\u2019t that bad. It\u2019s a slight hint of a smell that doesn\u2019t last long. No you will not be walking around with your face having a smell. Nonetheless I give this a 10/10. 100% worked for me"

I use it in the morning and night on targeted areas and I feel way more confident with an even complexion. I\u2019ve been able to simplify my makeup routine and cover up less of my skin (cutting out tinted moisturizer and lots of concealer). Tbh the smell is kinda like sulphuric/rubber to me, and doesn\u2019t smell great, but I much prefer this to a synthetic fragrance that would break me out and defeat the purpose of the product. And I feel secure that the active ingredients are doing their job! The scent throws people off but it doesn\u2019t linger, and the product sinks into my skin pretty quickly. It layers really well into my skincare routine. After using it for almost a year, its really changed my skincare game. I\u2019ll keep buying this as long as it\u2019s made!!"

I have used it on his skin before bed every single night, no skipping. I started the first week of April and by the one month mark it was pretty dramatic. The after photos are taken after two months of use. The pictures are not altered, at the same time of day, same spot and same light. The marks are so much better. His confidence is amazing as well. I contacted the founder to share how much this helps. So it has an off smell, if my autistic son who has aversions to many things can manage so can you. Just be consistent.

You can find lists with breakdowns of their highlighted ingredients, but they don't usually share the non-highlighted ones even though they're freakin star ingredients too lol. I guess it's too much to list every ingredient and how great they are.  -Topicals says the smell is from the sulfur group on the glutathione. When you pop this baby open it's so surprising and kinda awful. Not exactly like sulfur you'd find in a product with colloidal sulfur because different formulas, and not at all like rotten eggs. It's really unique and, if you haven't smelled glutathione before, a little shocking. Smell fades after 5-10 minutes for me, so it's tolerable, especially after you use it a few times and get a little more used to the smell.  -This works great for PIH and any other hyperpigmentation you might have (Not sure about fading- uneven tans yet since I haven't slathered my arms in this, but I'd love if it did). I get a couple pimples when it's that time of the month and usually the pigment lasts for 2-3 weeks. This time, it only lasted a week and I was ecstatic. It's also been helping to fade hyperpigmentation of some miscellaneous pigmented scars I've had for months now.  -There are exfoliating acids so be aware of that (helps it be a great spot treatment, but may irritate ya). I have hearty skin so I haven't had issues using my usual heavy active routine, but something to keep in mind."

Some people noted that it smells like rotten eggs, but it smells more like drain cleaner fluid. It dissipates quickly and is not an issue (I\u2019m looking for product effectiveness). I have two main issues with this product. Number one, it causes acne on the jawline. I believe it is due to shea butter being one of the main ingredients. It causes clogged pores and pimples that are hard to remove. The company should consider removing or replacing this ingredient, because it is too thick for wear (to note, I have medium/olive combo skin, and I used only a half pea size/tiny dab at night). The second issue is that it just stops working after a while and does not fully fix acne scars. Although it helps to decrease and fade them, months later, they are still there. Even with concealer you will see them. They are just flat, red and prominent. There are lots of products that fade imperfections to almost obscurity, but this is not one. In my opinion, it works better for acne than scarring. For reference, I have medium/olive combo skin that is not generally acne-prone (I only had this issue during lockdown). I got a generous 10ml sample size from Sephora as a promo with purchase, but I would not purchase this product."

The pic shows before and after a little over 6 weeks of daily use. I used it at least once a day but sometimes morning and night. I have sensitive skin so I used it AFTER my moisturizer and lemme tell ya that might be my new secret to success- using actives on top of moisturizer cuz u still get all the benefits with none of the irritation!   This has kinda an interesting texture it\u2019s a cream but somehow kinda stringy? Idk how to describe it but it wasn\u2019t unpleasant to use at all. Also it\u2019s gonna last foreverrrrr I use about half a pea sized each time and the tube looks like it basically hasn\u2019t been used.   It is quite pricey (for me anyways) but since hyperpigmentation was definitely my #1 concern I\u2019m fine spending money to help fix it.   If you have hyperpigmentation left behind by cuts/acne etc. I would recommend giving this a go!"

I\u2019ve read about Faded Topicals and ordered two tubes, hoping for the best. I was hesitant, but didn\u2019t care for the initial smell. After messaging the product in (20 min after my serum, before moisturizer), I noticed in a few weeks of using Faded a much glowier looking me! I also noticed the scars from my obsessive picking had reduced (not by too much, but I\u2019ve noticed a difference) and my brown spots had lightened significantly. AND! I\u2019ve also incorporated a facial sunscreen with SPF & hyaluronic acid daily to my rotation.  I started Faded 2-3 times a week and now I\u2019m gradually using 4x/week and on those days off, I\u2019m using The Ordinary AHA BHA peel and Weleda Skin Food Light (both are an inexpensive godsend!) I\u2019m still on my first tube, as you only need a pea-sized amount for your whole face. I\u2019ve read that you can use as a spot treatment, but I prefer to put it all over my face and I really love the results so far. Add a tube or two (or four?) in that shopping cart, as they sell out fast!! The pandemic has taught me a lot about self care, so this my friends, is IT. Let\u2019s get Faded together!!"

I\u2019ve had hyperpigmentation for years after a bad spell of hormonal acne when getting off BC (that only getting back on BC fixed). I was left with red/pink marks ALL over my cheeks. Since I have a ton to work with, I could see a noticeable difference after the first few uses! I don\u2019t expect it to work miracles but I do see a noticeable improvement. YES, it smells, but I put it on before bed anyway so it\u2019s not that serious. WEAR SUNSCREEN daily (this is the best way to prevent getting more hyperpigmentation) but especially if you\u2019re gonna use this.

It doesn't blend well, whether rubbing it in or patting it in it just feels sticky and heavy and I've tried using a lot and very little and it still pills. I've tried letting it absorb before continuing with the next products and nothing works for me. This didn't happen with the PTR discoloration treatment which that one is a true gel like texture that thins out as you apply it.

Anyways, I\u2019ve successfully lightened my hyperpigmented areas with 2-3% OTC hydroquinone in the past, but I think using that has made my melasma more stubborn to fading long-term. Also, you\u2019re supposed to take breaks from hydroquinone, which is annoying.  Sadly, for me Faded is sadly not as effective as hydroquinone despite me using it twice a day for 3 months.   Since I\u2019m a fan of the ingredients & don\u2019t plan on going back to hydroquinone, I will keep using Faded until I\u2019m done with tube & update.

I\u2019ve tried every peel, every acid, every brightening cream, every serum and every cosmetics procedure that money can buy and nothing worked for me.. some even made it worse.  I\u2019ve researched many factors that cause melasma and a lot are due to my genetics also, but that doesn\u2019t mean that I was going to give up trying everything and anything to help keep my spots from consuming my face (and my confidence) After seeing Susan Yara mention this product, I decided to look it up.. and all the ingredients individually are all amazing in combating hyperpigmentation, but all those in one product, yes please.  I started using 3x and week and it was gentle enough on my sensitive skin, that the next week, I used it 4 times. after 7 times in total I can already see results. I am so happy with this purchase.

This product literally started healing old acne scarring and now my face is much smoother by probably 40% in just a few months. Texture on my skin is much better and my skin looks much brighter... 80% brighter in four months. I have tried many products on the market and nothing compares and it does not cause more acne or make me break out when use it! This product will change your life and it does exactly what it says!

This serum contains a powerhouse of ingredients that help brighten dark spots and even out skin discoloration. The formula is gentle enough to be used on the face and body and is also effective enough for me to see results in as little as one month (which is huge considering stubborn spots can take months to fade). The packaging is also fun yet functional because it allows you to use up every single drop. If you're debating to try this, take the plunge, you will not regret it!"

But after following @Topicals advice on twitter where they have incredible threads of helpful tips/information on usage, I was ready to test it out. Faded does what it says it does. I started 1x a week on my cheeks to rid hyperpigmentation. I did purge (but again, new to actives) and after 4 weeks I could see a major difference. I now use Faded 2x a week on days I don\u2019t exfoliate with other products. You *absolutely must* wear sunscreen."

It\u2019s packed with ingredients that are tyronaise inhibitors which help stop over production of melanin that causes hyperpigmentation. Even will all the wonderful treatment ingredients, it still feels gentle on the skin and never irritated my sensitive skin. I like to use this 1/2x a week, but you can increase frequency as your skin adjusts to it. There\u2019s a slight funk in the smell, sulfur like, but it doesn\u2019t linger! SPF is a must with this product!"

I am a frequent skin picker (and working on it) but I love to use Faded to get rid of the dark spots and hyperpigmentation that seem to linger around forever after a breakout. If you use other exfoliants, I'd keep that to a minimum while using Faded because it has so many exfoliating and brightening ingredients. It has cleared up my hyperpigmentation so much!"
