This has upped my skin care routine to luxury level.  The tiny bristles are so soft and relaxing as you cleanse with a soothing massage.  You have the option to set the massage at Regular, Gentle, and Deep modes.  Wowza, I look forward to washing my face.  So very cleansing, far more then using my hands or a washcloth!  Initially I was a bit intimidated, but the Luna 4 could not be easier to set up.  After downloading the app and registering the device, you're ready to personalize your settings to fit your comfort level.  There are two settings, Cleansing Mode and Massage Mode. The app is designed brilliantly, so it's easy to understand.  There are 5 massage patterns to choose from in massage mode and each one feels fabulous, I tried them all.  My favorite is lymphatic drainage massage, but deep tissue, trigger point, Shiatsu, and reflexology are beneficial and enjoyable too.  Treatments that target firming, contour and define areas of the face and neck I find to be very relaxing. The app is excellent in guiding you through simple, informative steps to provide a customized experience.  A fabulous way to cleanse and pamper yourself.  My skin feels invigorated and the Luna 4 is so easy to use!"

I am surprised to find that the silicon bristles of this device are super soft that don't cause any discomfort. I like it is multifunctional as it can be used as a facial massager as well. Plus, one charge lasts for long time. Love it"

I saw that the 3rd version won the allure award so I figured I would try this since I feel like my hands can never clean my face as thoroughly. I enjoyed how this product had different cleansing modes, so if I wore makeup I can clean deeper to ensure all the gunk is out of my pores. Overall, I am really enjoying this product, and it's definitely worth the price for me."
