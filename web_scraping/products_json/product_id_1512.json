The 2 year warranty they clim to have is fake. AI tried contacting Sephora and they were no help as well. I asked a customer service representative from Sephora for a number so I could contact the company that sells the item since they cannot and they gave me the incorrect number to another company with the same name but sells childrens toysu2026 I think itu2019s crazy they have no way of helping their customers with a faulty product they sell on their website/app. Just do not buy this from Sephora buy a vibrator from an actual adult shop. I shouldu2019ve never trusted buying one from sephora but I trusted the reputation of the brand and never will again, HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE"

The design is sleek and elegant, and it feels incredibly smooth to the touch. The different vibration settings offer a range of sensations, from gentle and soothing to intense and exhilarating. If you're just starting out like I was, the tip might feel a bit large at first. However, with a little patience and practice, it becomes very comfortable and adds to the overall experience. It's also surprisingly quiet, which adds to the intimate experience. The battery life is fantastic, lasting through multiple sessions without needing a recharge. Cleanup is a breeze with its waterproof design. Overall, The Romantic lives up to its name, providing a truly delightful and romantic experience. I highly recommend it to anyone looking to add a touch of romance and excitement to their personal time. A perfect addition to my collection!"

This vibe is perfect for that with not only nine different pleasure settings, but ridged sides for partial to full insertion. As someone who enjoys outer play more, just because itu2019s meant to stimulate all your inside pleasure points, doesnu2019t mean it cannot be used to get those spots that are external. You deserve all of the self love!"

Don't go into this expecting something over the top or completely unique. It is that one dependable vibe that you can count on most of the time.

My favorite part is how it comes with five different vibration speeds that you can gradually transition to when many of my other vibrators only come with three speeds. I also love how Smile Makers includes cute stickers with them. Would highly recommend it!"

It's an insertable vibe, and I'm mostly used to seeing either combo toys or vibing ones that are for external use. I had my doubts, because I'm in a commited relationship with my rabbit-style one, but this still had some impressive qualities. It is bigger than I expected, both in length and in width, but it's silicone so as long as you use some looob you should be good to go. This was too long for me personally, but i thought it was nice for the shallower parts that I was able to use it for. It has a nice thrust-eeng setting that was unexpected, but the vibe can get pretty strong so just be aware!!"
