I have an ultra pale and cool undertone, so was a little wary of the gold center in the pink ice shade. It leans almost warm on me but still manages to look like a natural flush. I've only used it on top of concealer with primer and fixing spray so far, but I find it wears beautifully. This was my first Nudestix product, and though I wouldn't say it's worth $30, I'm happy with it!"

Its super little , when wound all the way up , I was shocked how little there was for 30.00! I was very disappointed with the size and value. I know prices have all gone up , but this seems extreme !

It kind of reminds me of the Charlotte Tilbury wands in a way. I love this shade Pink Ice, it's the perfect pink shade - not too cool not too warm toned. Instead of applying it directly to my face, I rubbed some on the back of my hand and went in with a brush so I could control the application, highly recommend trying your blushes this way if they come off as 'too much' on your face. Oh and it also lasts well on my face which is great, as I sometimes struggle with my blush disappearing throughout the day."

For reference, I have cool-tone fair skin and red hair with combo skin, and I dont like super balmy face products because I live in the humid south. I also apply products to the back of my hand and then apply by brush to my face for even application. The product in this shade is fragrance free, soft and creamy, not at all greasy or balmy, and dries down well when applied to the skin. I thought the color was a nice neutral with a soft glow that suited my skin tone and the product seemed to wear/last decently. I dont like gold highlights and the highlight in Rose Glow is a nice silver/neutral base."

This blush stick is everything, and let me tell you, my makeup game has been looking so much better since I incorporated this multi-tasking matte cream blush stick with an innovative juicy glow core into my routine! It's not only a blush, but it can also be used on your lips and eyes! I love that it is versatile, buildable and a stunning shade. I have used it every day for the past two weeks and my blush stays all day. I love that it is both matte and provides a dewy glow thanks to the juicy center containing ceramides and peptides. Lastly, I love that it is cruelty-free, vegan, synthetic fragrance-free (yay, no headaches!) formulated without parabens or phthalates and the packaging is eco-friendly. I received this product for free in exchange for my honest review."

I think this particular shade was a little harsh for my pale coloring so I would like to try a lighter, softer shade in the future. Good product overall."

To apply, I dotted it on my cheek area and tapped to blend. I liked that I didn't have to rub.  Even though this shade is described as cool-toned, I found it could go either way.

            "review_text": "I received the product for free as part of the BzzAgent program from Nudestix in exchange for writing that review.   I will be separating my review in three parts ; packaging, ingredients and performance.   1. Packaging :  First, the little plastic box is biodegredable. Also, I like that you can roll the bottom of the container up and down to get the product.  Finally, the cap and the product are the same color, so no confusion !  2. Ingredient : I wouldnt use it the lips due to the ingredients even if you can. (lots of silicone and titanium dioxide).   12 months of shelf life is good for a cream product.  It is made in Korea where the skincare is so reputable, so I think its a plus.  The inner core have skincare benefits. They say its good to help with plumpness and hydratation of your skin.  I think the ceramides are too far in the ingredient list to have an impact.    3. Performance : You need to apply it with a sponge, not directly on the skin if you have makeup on or it will disrupt the base and be patchy.   The color payoff is good, but not amazing. The colour doesnt smudge and It doesnt emphasize skin texture like pores, but as the day goes, it fades away  I hate that there are small shimmers in the inner core.    Summarize : So, I think its not the best on the market. I think its a little pricey (34$ CAD for 6g/0.21 oz). There are similar products for a quarter of the price. I think the main selling point of this product is the skincare in it. I would recommend to friends who dont wear foundation so the skincare could have the potential to do something."

Unfortunately, the cool tones don't go well with my warm undertones, and the colour was far too light for my deeper skin.  When I would apply and blend with my fingertips, the colour virtually disappeared, leaving behind as slight shimmer and dewiness from the glow core.  I can see how it gives a lit from within look, but would definitely want to see either a heavier pigmentation or wider shade range.  Can't comment on longevity as the colour wasn't apparent to begin with."

I have always used powder, and now I definitely prefer the blush stick because of the dewy finish. The highlight in the middle is a nice feature and mixes in well with the blush.

The color of this blush is absolutely lovely, and the added glow is a charming touch. I found that applying it with a brush worked best for me, but once it's on, it's perfect for those days when you want that fresh, dewy look without heavy makeup. The blush adds a natural flush to my cheeks, making my skin look radiant and healthy. It's the ideal choice for a no makeup makeup day when you want to look effortlessly beautiful.  I'm a fan of stick blushes. What I really appreciate is the creamy formula u2013 it leaves my skin feeling soft and pampered. The color is a winner too, giving my cheeks a super pretty and natural tint. Now, some people might expect a noticeable highlight effect, given the name, but  the glow part wasn't very noticeable. It's more like a blush with a subtle shimmer. However, even without the intense highlight, I still think it's a fantastic product overall. It's perfect for achieving that healthy, rosy look with a soft touch, and that's something I really like about it."

The formula is pigmented and creamy and it gives me a natural flushed glow. I took away one star because I seem to break out on my cheeks a little after I use it. This could be a coincidence, but acne-prone users may want to take note of this. I would still recommend though because the colour, pigmentation, and blendability are great!"

I like how its so easy to use just a stick I dont have to use a make up brush I can just straight apply it on my face and just rub the spot using my fingers . Its multifunction perfect for carry on I hate carrying so much products I just need one item to fit in my pocket  Best of all this brand does not test on animal would recommend it to friends and family I would purchase this again"

It is super creamy and blendable and gives the perfect sunkissed glow. The shimmer in the center of the stick isnt super overpowering and blends out very nicely. I like this cream blush and apply it to the apples of my cheeks and the high points of my cheeks.  It says this product is multi tasking so I applied this to my lips and it left my lips with a nice hint of color and also was creamy and non drying on my lips. The color I received is not usually a color I would pick but I actually was suprised once I applied it on my face that it did suit my features really well. The product packaging is nice and sleek, and I like that the plastic box packaging it came in is biodegradable. Overall I would recommend this multi tasking cream blush, I like that it leaves me with a nice pinch of sunkiss to my face and overall leaves me feeling radiant. I will recommend this to my friends and family members and once I run out I would repurchase and try out the other colors. Overall it was a hit in my books!"

When applied these give a beautiful glow, but I was a little disappointed that there wasnt more pearly shimmer. To me the finish is not quite different from the look of the nudies bloom. These have slightly less product than original nudies (6g vs 7) and the component is smaller, which I like, because theres no brush on the bottom. Overall Id recommend this product and like that it has added skincare benefits."

It's a sheer wash of colour thanks to the 'glow core', making it difficult to overdo it. It's a very nice finish which minimized texture in my opinion, but just lacks the longevity of a more matte formula. However, the compact size makes it easy to take this on the go with you for touch ups.  A bit more: I love this packaging compared to their other blush sticks as it's more compact and they ditches the useless brush! However, I do find this formula a bit lacking compared to their others, as it's incredibly sheer and not as long-lasting. A few pros/cons in comparison to their other blushes but overall a nice product."

Ice pink is a beautiful cool toned pink (although it works well for my warm toned skin) with a gold shimmer in the middle. This is pretty creamy, I find that i'm not afraid to glide it on my face directly, as it doesn't lift up any makeup underneath. I prefer to blend it in with my fingers by lightly tapping on the edges. The formula is not too emollient or too dry.  I've even applied it on top of powder a few times and it didn't look patchy. I will typically set it with a powder blush after and I've found that I didn't need to retouch my blush throughout the day.The stick is very compact and easy to take on the go! I also think the price is very fair, its not a whopping $45 dollar for a blush. Overall, very impressed and really open to trying more from their brand."

Its so simple to use, a swipe and blend with my fingers, given that is a cream blush, I dont even use any brushes. The shimmer part is so subtle and nice as well.

I'm not ready to champion this product over a good old blush and highlighter (seperated). The matte and glow combo in one stick isn't a winner for me. This is my first cream blush, so it's difficult to compare with another cream product, but comparing with a powder blush, it's easier to diffuse. I notice that this product is good just on its own on a light make up type of day. The reason it got 3 starts it's because it's a stick! You can't apply this product on top of fondaction, or cc cream without removing it! Yes, I can brush the top of the stick on a brush and then apply it, but then, it all melts into one color. I could compare it with the Cream version of the Milani  bake blush which is one of my favorite blush out there.  I wouldn't buy it again as I also notice how easy it is for it to kinda melt or break. I had to push it back in with my finger. I would recommend this product to my less experience friends or for people on the go. It's such a easy product to just apply, place with the finger and leave. Just don't apply makeup under it lol!"

I would describe the product itself as a skin-like or satin finish. It stays creamy on your skin and is very pigmented, so a little goes a long way. I am fair-light in complexion with combination-oily skin and I only need a little dab on each cheek when I use the Peach Pearl colour. It blends out very easily, I prefer to use a slightly fluffy flat brush or standard cream blush brush. The end result looks incredibly natural and you cant tell thats its not my own natural flush.  The staying power is quite good, better than other high-end cream blushes that dont dry down. It wears well through my 12 hour shifts but does transfer off slightly when wearing a mask.   Id say its overall its a solid product, more reasonably priced than a lot of whats on the market nowadays and most makeup wearers would be pleased with it. Obviously this is not a product for people who want/need matte finish or transfer-proof makeup."

I am removing a star because it seemed a touch too pigmented, even when Ive just dabbed my blush brush over it. This made it a bit more cumbersome to blend, but it did spread well. I am quite fair in tone, and Peach Pearl was definitely too deep for my skintone, pulling more neon pink than peach.   Overall, I like the actual formulation of this blush, but I think a lighter shade may suit me better."

The product is super easy to use, it comes in an applicator and you can apply as little or much of the product as you like to wherever you would like a bit of color or glow. It has buildable color so it can give you a subtle or more defined look depending on your preference. I really liked the nice pink color of the blush and it suited my skin tone well.

When applying this product I loved how creamy and blendable it was, however I was not impressed by the colour payoff. I expected the magenta shade to give more of a pop, but it took quite a lot of layering to achieve the desired effect. Keep in mind, I am not a heavy blush user. I did enjoy the glow the product gave me. It wasn't too sparkly or greasy looking, just a nice hydrated sheen.   Given the lacklustre colour payoff, I was surprised that this blush lasted all evening. I did layer it on top of foundation and under setting spray, however I didn't powder it.   In terms of the skincare benefit, I honestly find it quite gimmicky for products like this. In makeup products, most skincare treatment-type ingredients end up much too diluted to do much of anything. Even if there was enough peptide to really make a difference, I am only applying it to a small part of my face in low quantities, and nowhere near consistently enough to produce or maintain any benefit. I understand that skincare claims in makeup products sell well these days, but it is just disingenuous to me.   That being said, I will wear this again, because the overall effect is quite pretty and I was surprised at how well it lasted on my combination skin."

            "review_text": "I received the colour Sunset Gold to review.  When I first opened the package I was surprised at how little the product was. I wasnt familiar with the launch and expected something more like the regular cream blushes in the line. You are getting one gram less of actual product and there is no attached brush. The component itself feels very light and a little cheap in my opinion. For $34 I would expect something more substantial, but on the other hand the lightweight packaging makes this ideal for travel.  Onto the product, this blush is pigmented! A little goes a very long way. Rather than swiping the product directly onto the cheeks, I prefer to use a brush to grab some product and then slowly build up the colour since this can get into clown-cheek territory very fast. When it comes to the u201cglow coreu201d I cant really say that I notice much effect. It provides no noticeable shimmer or glitter and as for skincare benefits, I apply so little and to only a small portion of my face that even if something were happening, I dont think I would be able to see any results. I have a very oily skin type so I always powder over top of this with a translucent setting powder. Because of this, I cant speak to the products dewiness claims.  Overall, this is a good blush product if you are looking for a highly pigment blush stick with possible skincare benefits."

The stick is so neat, an outer ring of blush with a highlightesque cream core.  This is such a simple product to use u2013 brush it on for a soft, diffused look or apply directly to the face for a more intense pigment. This is totally buildable and the radiant finish is so stunning. This stick has skincare ingredients like peptides and ceramides to plump and protect the skin and leaves a slight dewy finish on my face.  You just need a little bit of this to get a subtle glow and it blends like a dream. Another plus? Perfect. For. Travel. No need to worry about spills! I am so impressed with this stick, its the perfect blush transition into the autumn season for me.  *Gifted, thank you @nudestix and @bzzagent !"

It was intimidating as I am South Asian and warm tones suit me better, but once I got it I realized it was a bit more muted than the pictures made it seem. For me, that was a plus.  I like that it spreads very evenly, and there's no feeling of cakiness/oiliness whatsoever. I also like that you can build the colour to be however strong you'd like it to be. I personally didnt notice a ton of payout with the highlighter part, but I personally don't like very prominent highlighter, so I was fine with this. I've attached a pic to show what the highlighter core actually looks like.  The one negative I will say is that I didn't find it to be very lon glasting. Again, this may be related to me preferring a more subtle colour so not putting too much on to begin with, but I do wish it wouldn't absorb into the skin too quickly. I'd definitely recommend if you want a blush thats not so bold, but maybe look elsewhere if subtle or natural isn't your thing."

My skin is quite pale with yellow undertones (1w1 in Estee Lauder and 12y in Sephora brand foundation) so its hard to find a blush that doesn't look too obnoxious or unflattering when actually applied. This is why I was so shocked when I tried this Nudestix blush. The color is quite vibrant in the tube and when you first apply it, but It actually blends beautifully, particularly when paired with contour powder. It provides a buildable coverage and a little goes a long way particularly if you are pale and looking for a more natural look like me. Even when applying a small amount the gold glow core brightens up your face to provide subtle but fresh look. I've been using this blush with the Sephora brand setting spray every day for the last week and consistently gotten all day wear without the need for touch ups. I've only used it as a blush so far but am looking forward to experimenting with it more.  If you're on the fence I totally recommend you give it a try!"

Good pigmentation allows for a sheer wash of colour with just one swipe. But you might have to apply the product more than once to get a more pronounced glow. Without being overly glittery, the subtle shimmer gives the cheeks a lovely dimension."

Applying flat does give you a dewier finish and using the side a creamy satin finish.   Its long lasting on its own with out powder blush on top.  Id Apply onto the back of my hand first if the pigment is too intense on fair skin."

I always enjoy the stick feature as it is travel friendly. I like that they didnt include a brush for this. I find the center gimmicky. I dont really know what its for? The center for this one has gold shimmer so I guess it adds shimmer to the blush? I wouldve rather them made the blush shimmery rather than it have that center thing? Cause when you swipe it, the center just mixes with the blush."

Other than that small complaint the formula is quintessential Nudestixu2026 buttery smooth and highly pigmented! The packaging is truly an upgrade from the bulky tin their line usually comes in and it feels compact, sleek and durable thrown around in a makeup bag.

It blended easily with fingers or a brush and is buildable if you want more noticeable color. I have oily skin and often find cream products just melt away throughout the day, but could still see the flush after 8 hours. After two years working from home and barely wearing makeup, I like the ease of use and the natural glow it gives. A quick swipe, a few dabs of my finger to blend, and I actually look alive!"
