I found it to be very runny, but it applied well. Once all of my makeup was done, my husband and I couldn't help but notice I had aged about 20 years. I made every imperfection and line appear, and the product sat very dry on my skin. It's just very uncomfortable hours later, feeling a little like dried mud. I'm glad I bought the mini to try but will definitely switch brands. A huge waste of money for sure for a terrible product :("

            "review_text": "I haven't tried it yet, but since I ordered it online, I didn't realize what a tiny little thing this is for $20! Since its been shipped and already here, I'll just keep it because returning is going to cost me gas money just to get it to a store. And we all know, these products are hyper marked up to account for free shipping expenses. But this is a travel size. In my photos, for reference, I have the original smashbox pore minimizer primer I bought 2 years ago, and just bought the larger hydrating primer after I received this dinky one and got it in the mail maybe a day or two ago. The large sizes are both 1 fl. oz. Its literally more than half of the new one. They are cutting corners on cost to consumers! The green primer that reduces redness, I had bought 5 years ago, when things were normal priced. Look at the size difference. This travel size hydrating primer is only .34 fl. oz or 10mL. Even though, the green primer doesn't show the size and I've thrown away the original packaging, its most likely at least .5 fl oz, or 15mL. Just see the difference! They cut corners by 1/3rd and hoped nobody would notice. I was going to give 2 stars, but actually, changed my mind because of consumer and marketing engineering practices. But still charging half price for 1/3rd of its original product.  I've always been a Sephora fan, but they have price competitors now, and the free samples suck now. Not to mention, the online shops don't give enough information. Their web team is lazy, barely providing enough graphic images, and relying on the customer to read every single label. Naturally easier in-store because you can pick it up, see it in-person, and sample it... etc. Online shopping, not an easy experience. So I am going to be looking at other options that are more competitive."

Now this new formula uses a squeeze tube which feels cheaper than the old pump and it dries down super fast. The old formula was not sticky at all however this new one makes makeup so much harder to blend as if I didnu2019t even put moisturizer on. Very sad to see this product changed."

However, this primer actually worked how it said it would and did not feel sticky like the previous primer I remember them having. My face felt more hydrated, and it looked more dewy and plump. I was extremely happy this primer also worked under powder foundations as I have been lazy and using more of those lately. I did take off a star though as it states it was similar to the primer oil and I like the primer oil much better."

I smoothed it over my clean skin & it leaves my skin feeling so fresh, hydrated, and absorbed beautifully into my skin. It makes my skin healthy looking with a soft dewy finish, along with providing a breathable veil that helps smooth + blur imperfections, and it helps my makeup glide on easier and keeps it in place for for a longer period of time. I also like that it is vegan, and is cruelty-free. I would highly recommend this hydrating primer to others, and I absolutely love it!"

If you don't have problems with pores, just struggle with oily skin, I think this is the first one for you.  I struggle a bit with large pores in my cheek area, so I prefer a little more Baby Skin or Porefessional  What I see with the different primers that I have tried is that it depends a lot on what kind of problem you want to solve, because all of them without exception work very well as a base so that the makeup stays longer.  It is an extra that they help you with excess oil or reduce the appearance of pores The Smashbox primer is much better than Maybelline or Benefit primers to reduce excess oil, so it depends a lot on that extra that you want to give your skin to select a highly recommended primer"

All in all, I used this primer on two separate occasions, both over 8 hours and my makeup wore beautifully. The primer isn't too thick, but isn't thin either making it, in my opinion, the perfect consistency. I would recommend if you are dry, or combo but for combo/oily skin I would suggest to only use in dryer areas of your face."

This primer is hydrating, it feels cooling on my skin, and absorbs easily. I paired it w/a coordinating foundation, and let me just say...GAME CHANGER!

But no worries because the feeling does eventually fade so I do suggest waiting a little before applying makeup.  I had no issues applying the makeup once it dried and I did feel like it created a nice base. Also, once I was done I did like the way my makeup looked.

At this point I would have given it 5 stars. The only issue and the reason for only 4 stars was that after about 4-5 hours I noticed that my foundation on certain areas on my face started to look dry and cakey. I couldn't figure out a way to fix this issue quickly so I'm my opinion the only way to fix this would be to remove my makeup and start over. Which isn't always an option for everyone.

That original silicone one that was all the rage was just awful and others have broken me out. the consistency is runnier than I was expecting, and when I put it on, I wasn't 100% sure it would do anything.  but when I put on my powder, BAM! it looked really nice. My skin had a glow and definitely blurred my pores. I'm a minimal makeup girl so usually just primer, powder, brows and lashes.  And I never wear foundation (tinted moisturizer at most), so I can't say how the primer looks under it."

If you have dry skin and you enjoy wearing makeup, this is a great first step for you! Even though I have oily skin, I can use this primer, it just doesn't prolong makeup wear for me.  Influenster sent this over for me to try, but I tried it before. My thoughts are my own."

It seemed to be more silicone and would just sit on top of my skin for some reason. I didn't have high expectations for this one because of that. But, I did try it and to my surprise , it was much better than the Original for me.  I don't like one to just sit on top and this one kinda melted into my skin but still did great as a primer even though it soaked up like a moisturizer.  It was definitely moisturizing and it held my makeup in place at least 8 hours for me during work day. I even sweat alot as a personal trainer.  It's a win for me!

It has #hyaluronicacid and #niacinamide, you can definitely tell from the texture that this is a niacinamide product. It has that trademark milky almost tacky consistency that most niacinamide serums possess. Selfie 1 bare skin, selfie 2 primer alone, 3 is primer with foundation, 4 is just foundation with no primer. It applies like a milky serum and absorbs quickly leaving a very slightly tacky feeling on the skin, but nothing unpleasant. You could definitely wear this on its own without foundation. I personally have dry skin and did not feel quite moisturized enough with this serum on bare skin, I would definitely pair it with a moisturizer in the future. I loooove that this is fragrance free and only has a few botanical extracts so there is next to no scent. I also thought the inclusion of yeast ferment extracts is a nice touch, I love seeing these included in hydrating formulas. This primer also played well under my go to foundation, I paired my Estee Lauder Double Wear Sheer and skipped any setting powders. It sets to a beautiful dewy finish that looks natural but still covers any skin tone issues. My only qualm is the price tag, $40 is a very high price for what is basically your standard niacinamide serum. Iu2019ve also attached a final picture from a day I wore my sheer foundation alone with no primer, and there is practically no difference in the end result. I definitely feel a bit more hydrated wearing the primer underneath, but I was not wowed enough to put this on my list of things to repurchase. #SmashboxPrimer #PrimedFor #complimentary @Smashboxcosmetics @Influenster"

Overall: itu2019s still photo finish but with moisturizers added so itu2019s less irritating than before. If you donu2019t like how heavy the original photo finish is, try this primer instead.

Fast forward to my late 20u2019s now. I was curious about primers since influencers swear by them. I asked an associate to recommend a primer for a noob and he showed me to the sample size. The tube lasted several uses since it doesnu2019t require much. I applied it all over my face and instantly felt silky smooth and powder fresh. I was planning on using a foundation but my skin looked so great, I decided to go without. I did a light powder eyeshadow and saw no creases hours later. Half way through the sample tube, I noticed my skin appeared much healthier and had less break outs. I bought this same product for my teenaged cousin with oily skin. She began using it and had the same results. Her acne cleared up tremendously. Iu2019m still using this product a year later. I hope this helps you decide to buy. At least try it."

So if you are an oily girl but still get dry skin this is a winner for you. It won't make you greasy. I love how it has a skincare complex in it as well so you don't have to worry about a long skincare routine before makeup. It takes care of all that. It has triple hyaluronic acid, silkscreen complex, niacinamide, algae, caffeine, lactobacillus ferment, yeast extract and lycium Chinese fruit extract. It really does help blur your skin and give a flawless finish. I highly recommend if you're looking for a hydrating but non greasy primer. They also have other primers if you want other concern areas taken care of if you dont need the hydration complex. But I love it since it helps cut the time of worrying about skincare and has such a wonderful effect!"

A created silky barrier and made my skin look more smooth, however I would definitely recommend always finishing off with the sunscreen on top.

With it being winter i was excited to have something more hydrating and also get a more natural hydrated look for my light coverage looks, but this primer, perhaps counteracting with my moisturizer, it was pilling, which is annoying. I tried different amounts, but somehow still did it. i only targeted my forehead my last try and used a tiny tiny amount and it was okay. I honestly am not in u201caweu201d of this primer, there a many other products out there that give more for half the price."

I donu2019t look greasy or sweaty, just fresh and hydrated. Seriously obsessed with this product. I did get sent it for free, so would I purchase it w my own money? 7289952%. But also no because Iu2019m broke hahaha. Oh yeah and my skin feels amazing w it. It isnu2019t heavy or uncomfortable, just feels like an extra layer of moisturizer. Honestly Iu2019d wear it w out any makeup over it bc It looks that good hahah"

I especially liked that it was a hydrating primer because I like The Dewy skin look as opposed to a matte finish. Unfortunately no matter how many times I tried to combine this with different foundations or different skin products it always peeled up and made my foundation look cakey. With my other primers or even with bare skin I never have a problem with makeup going into my pores or caking up, but with this primer it immediately made everything form into small balls all over my face and look very uneven. The effect seemed to smooth out a little as I wore it throughout the day, maybe from the heat of my skin or something, but it definitely didn't smooth my skin and make my makeup look better, if anything it made my makeup look more fake. I gave it three stars because it is decently moisturizing and it doesn't feel like I've put a heavy greasy product on my face like some of the primers do. I use a lot of Korean skin care which is very dewy and moisturized so it may just be the skin care products that I'm using alongside it"
