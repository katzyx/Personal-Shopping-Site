This new one has ripped and has chunks coming out of it within the first use. Also pink dye pours out of the sponge with each wash which means that the dye seeping into my skin. Unacceptable and disappointing that beauty blender has deceived its loyal customers and changed their quality. I will never buy one again."

Before they would last a year.. At this rate, I'd be happy if they lasted three months. I have one more I bought as backup but I'm going to have to start looking for alternatives."

The first thing that I noticed about this one is that itu2019s slightly smaller than others Iu2019ve tried, but it does swell almost just as big once itu2019s wet and squeezed out. The texture isnu2019t quite as smooth as the cheaper ones that I have, but thatu2019s almost a benefit because those can sort of slide the make up around and not apply it evenly. This one seems to apply the make up very evenly and I also use it to smooth out make up applied with a brush, and to blend in my contouring products. It does a good job. I also use it for dry powder to bake my under eye area and it applies the dry powder fairly evenly. I also love the little solid cleanser! Complimentary from beautyblender for my review."

When wet, it expands to twice its size and becomes even softer and more pliable. This makes it easy to blend makeup into the skin without any harsh lines or streaks. It is very absorbent, but it does not absorb too much makeup. This means that you can use less makeup and still achieve a flawless finish. It is easy to clean and maintain. I simply wash it with mild soap and water after each use, and it dries quickly."

I haven't gotten those black marks others have gotten (yuck!) but within a couple of months the sponge gets a sort of sweet rotting smell that makes me feel that the sponge was no longer something I wanted near my skin. I wash my sponge every single day and it used to be that the sponge would last for months. It is not an inexpensive sponge so I counted on this.

I have seen over 1000's of both negative and positive reviews. I personally disagree with a few opinions others have shared. This product can be used best when the sponge is wet. This baby absorbs and I do mean absorbs water, but it does not absorb your makeup.   I have seen people complain and say the sponge developed mold in a matter of weeks. This is caused by no proper cleaning after use or left makeup on the sponge and not using certain products to clean any bacteria that may develop on the sponge after use.  I enjoyed every minute of using this sponge and yes I would spend $20 on a makeup sponge again. I spend $500-$600 on Xbox materials, and gear. I even spend money on small businesses' products, I do a bunch of giveaways when I stream on Twitch, so $20 is nothing at all.   The beauty blender absorbs water very well, and it gets about 3x its normal size. It feels very, very, soft, when it needs to be dried out, it does go back to its normal size as presented when you first bought it. And it feels very smooth to the touch and when applied.   I did use this with many different brands of makeup foundations, I also used the beauty blender foundation. The only issue with my foundation was I was given the wrong shade. Which is fine, I made it work anyway, which as result it did make me 2 shades darker than my natural skin tone. It does effectively blend so well with my skin and feels very lightweight and not caked on and thick.   I would use this foundation and the beauty blender again but make sure I get the right shade. I was very excited to try this product I am in the beginning stage of using makeup products and am used to experimenting with different brands, colors, thicknesses, thinness, long-lasting wear, etc. I do recommend using it if conducted properly and giving it more than a 1-time"

What I donu2019t like, is that the color washes out and you can see the pink rinsing away when you wash it. The application of the foundation (which is the other product) was ok. You need to wet the sponge, then apply the foundation. I thought that it evenly distributed ok, but it takes a ton of product. Iu2019ve always thought more product goes into the sponge than your face, so I found it more wasteful. I also think it takes a lot longer to apply, being that for me, I need 2 or 3 applications to get my medium to full coverage. Iu2019m so used to just applying with my fingers and getting instant coverage from my current products. But I will say that the finished result is good and I look airbrushed and more even for the skin tone. This would be good for an at home u201cspa dayu201d when you want to chill and pamper yourself, but I would not put this on before work when Iu2019m in a hurry."

It was most definitely leaking pink pigment out of the blender. I did like the coverage, and the soft texture of the blender. It was bouncy and the damp foam felt cool on my skin which was lovely. It was too large to really get into some spots near my nose and eyes so I just blended those areas with my fingers. It doesn't really seem very durable unfortunately. With the first use it had a slice in it from me holding it as well as stains from foundation. Overall, I think at the price point it should not have been leaking color or breaking upon first use, so I would only be willing to repurchase if I could find a good sale or great coupon."

It's well worth the price because of the quality and the life span of this product,  even after using and washing it at least 5 days a week, every week, every month,  for months!!! The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars is because the original (pink) beauty blender bleeds pink! You have to wash it so many times to finally rid of the pink dye that comes out,  but even after you think there's no more,  there's still pink left over.  I prefer to stick to any other color besides the pink,  but that's the only con I have.  I have received this product for free to review and all opinions are my own.  I have used this sponge long before receiving it to review and I still love it just as much today and I did when I first tried it years ago!"

Iu2019ve always been a fan of the beauty blender but never used it to apply foundation until using it with the new liquid whip long wear foundation. Iu2019ve always used it to apply my makeup and set my under eye concealer with powder. I just want to kick myself because I never used the beauty blender until now to apply the liquid whip long wear foundation in 4.40 N deep and it look flawless and airbrushed. It looked like my skin in a bottle. This is the best application tool Iu2019ve used in a very long time. Definitely #1 in my makeup tools. You will not be disappointed."

The color that was sent to me a little to light for me but I will be purchasing a shade that works better for me. The photo showing me wearing the makeup was a screenshot from a video to post on ig!! I have very sensitive skin and I left the product on for at least 30 mins before I washed it off to see if I would have any itching with the product which I do with most foundations but not with this product. I just wish it was closer to my shade so I could be using the product."

I love that the sponge comes in itu2019s own reusable container. I used my sponge to apply my liquid with long ware foundation. I really appreciate it the size it feel perfect in my hand. Also it was very easy to apply the make up with the sponge without it feeling heavy afterwards. I used the sponge dry, but once I had started to apply the make up on my face is that easier to apply and spread evenly. I will use again wet in the future to see which I prefer. I definitely will buy the sponge in the future!!!"

Thereu2019s something about the material in this one that makes blending your foundation a lot smoother. I thought it was a scam but now Iu2019m kind of a believer. I donu2019t know if itu2019s worth $20, honestly, but there IS a major difference in quality if you use this sponge over others. This product makes foundation blending easier & finish a lot faster. I didnu2019t have to work as much to make my foundation look even. But I could probably do it with a cheaper, more dense makeup sponge if I took my time.   Buy this for convenience if you do your makeup in a hurry often. But donu2019t be fooled into thinking you need it."

My foundation applies smoothly and easily, and itu2019s pretty easy to clean with their soap bar or any soap. I usually use the liquid Bronneru2019s peppermint soap or a charcoal facial soap bar that I have at my sink. I love it so much I even keep one in my travel bag in one of their travel cases. It might be a little more expensive than the other ones that are out on the market, but is consistently probably the best foundation applicator that I have ever purchased."

I never used a blending sponge before except for a soft one from my occupational therapy office(just to try it lol) which obviously doesnt hold a candle to this product. It went on very smoothly with some light dabbing and blended very well after expanding somewhat from the addition of water as instructed. The other u201cspongeu201d i tried just soaked up all my product and left me looking like a kids art project while this one did what it was supposed to be spread the product evenly over my skin without absorbing it and using a minimal amount of product. Normally i use a foundation brush for application but was never truly happy with the finish as it sometimes left streaky lines from the brushes fibers. Will likely be switching to this as my regular application medium."

Then until Wayne Goss and some of the Asian best he followed presented brush-harvested and cruel-free I was stuck in a time-warp. With synthetics and aging skin. A lifetime of mostly acne-free oiliness did me some favors. Then I saw this pink thing. I thought it looked like junk. I was proud to refuse buying it. One day I bought a bad dupe. Then one day I read or saw something that intrigued me. I bought it. OMG!!! I am on my 3rd. The pink eggs are a miracle! I don't know if this tip will help anyone else; I always have a clean or with clean-sides left small towel dedicated for the BEAUTYBLENDER. I first wash it with a bit of any reasonable soap, gently, Then I squeeze and rinse. Then I twirl in clean under the faucet and let it get fat and absorb water. Then I give it a slight squeeze. Then it's still real wet and I light press it into the clean towel, so it is plink and full but not squeezing water out. Then I mix foundation or mix on outside of my hand. Then I use the Wayne Goss trick and add one dot of quality oil (Josie Maran Argan) and mix quickly and dot over half my face. Then I bounce and spread. Do the other half. Any left over is left for extra spots of coverage. Then concealer using the Beauty Blender again, then some powder. Then I gently squeeze and then towel squeeze the BB again and let it fully dry in a little holder I have. Sorry so long. It is a genius device. It needs to be holding water, but not too wet. And you must clean it before using again, but most important? Give it a little rinse at least, a gentle squeeze, and a towel squeeze with a clean towel. DO NOT put your foundation on it. You will love it!"

I can see why people like this...1) It feels good 2) very bouncy and light on the face 3) Does a good job applying makeup sheerly and can even be used for creamy blush & highlighter blending. So in terms of doing its job, it's great.  What I don't like:  It's wasteful. 1) There's a major drought where I live and this requires a lot of water to soak it and then wash it after every use. 2) I am using at least 4X more foundation than I normally do. When applying foundation with clean fingers, as I've done for 40 years, I use about two pea-size drops. With this, I'm using at least a quarter-size drop or more. 3) It's one more thing on my counter and requires buying makeup cleaner, drying it out, etc. Trying to decide if it's worth the drive to return it, but regardless, I won't buy another one.  Short version: This is a good product but just not right for me."

I have tried so many different sponges and although they are amazing, like the original Real techniques sponge or the ELF Total Face Sponge, nothing really compares to the original beauty blender - my other sponges do not grip loose translucent powder like the beauty blender does to bake, which is a letdown. The size of the beauty blender seems small but becomes much bigger when damp. It also lasts a great amount of time for me, like about a year, but I would typically change my beauty blender within the first 6 months as it could be unhygienic to keep it for longer (6 months might be a long time for some people too, but I use other sponges as well and clean them excessively). A lot of people say that this sponge is overhyped and overrated but it works really well for me, so personally, I would say it is worth the hype if you are willing to spend the money on a sponge. It makes my makeup application look so smooth and flawless, especially my under eyes!"

But I was so disappointed for a few reasons: 1) itu2019s super small and even when wet, it doesnu2019t expand much. 2) the coverage is really unimpressive versus the original sponge the makeup artist used and 3) when washing the makeup off the sponge using a tea tree oil soap, the pink dye started coming off which is so disturbing! Luckily, I texted the artist for the original sponge she used and bought a whole bunch. The craziest part- the sponges she used which were so superior to this one (brand was AOA Wonder Blend), are a fraction of the cost found on other sites."

It makes foundation glide onto the skin yet blends it like a clean layer of new skin!! This is so easy to clean too and doesnu2019t hold soap and makeup deep inside of it like others do! The size fits perfectly in your hand and the pointed tip is the perfect angle to get the corner of your eyes and nose! Use the side walls to apply the foundation first, the pointed for hard to reach areas and the bottom bigger area for blending the final look! I love all the different colors you can get and different sizes but the pink original beauty blender is the best one personally! The white one you can you for blending serums into your skin or moisturizer, the black is for contouring, pink is for every day makeup and applying liquid foundation and the minis are for the under eye, corner of eyes and nose and if you want more a precise look! They make the best makeup brush cleanser that works incredibly well getting all the makeup off the blender and on brushes as well! For $20 you canu2019t beat what you get and what this does! Itu2019s a must have in any persons makeup kit!!"

I like the nice packaging and the plastic container it comes in for storage. Itu2019s worth the 20.00, will last a long time. Washes out nicely with my Dr. Bronneru2019s liquid soap. Iu2019m going to try out the new green plant based blender that just came out, I love the green color and the fact thatu2019s itu2019s better for the environment. Until then I highly recommend this pink one!!"

Also very hard to clean. After rinsing and squeezing several times, I had to squeeze so hard between tissue paper to get the actual makeup out and that was not even 1OO%. See photos.

Doesnu2019t absorb too much product either. My only complaint is the pink dyeu2014it doesnu2019t come off on my face at all, but when I wash the sponge, it bleeds pink, and I really donu2019t like that. It still bleeds out even after several washes. It makes me think thereu2019s way too much dye in there...and I donu2019t want that on my skin. Doesnu2019t seem healthy. I used to have the black sponge and I donu2019t remember any dye bleeding out of it, but maybe I just didnu2019t notice. Going to order the nude sponge next time.

However, last like 6 months Iu2019ve used generic ones since I was on a budget. When I finally ran out, I saw a seasonal 3pk of purple bb that was on sale, which I couldnu2019t pass up 3 of these sponges for like 30 bux. However, they are absolutely not the same as this original pink one. The first one has gone in the trash after about 5 uses, and the second one Iu2019ve used once and itu2019s the same horrible quality as the first. So Iu2019m out 30 bux on sponges that are drug store quality.   That was last month. I went to Sephora the other day, and I asked the lady if they changed the quality or anything and she said no, and assured me that the original pink one is the same as it has always been. She suggested that maybe it had to do with the color. So I went ahead and bought one of the original pink ones. Iu2019ve used it twice and it is not the same as I remember it being. Itu2019s very porous, sucks up all my foundation and doesnu2019t rinse well either. Normally I would ring it out with a simple squeeze from a paper towel, which Iu2019ve done for the last 3 years, and they would have the perfect amount of moisture inside, and with this one, itu2019s like completely dried when I do that. I would be returning this if I hadnu2019t tossed out the packing. So now Iu2019m out another 20 bux.  This pink one isnu2019t as bad as that 3pk of purple ones I got, but itu2019s pretty close. I have a feeling that there must of been a cost increase to manufacture so they made a cheaper quality product to keep the price at $20 instead of just increasing the cost and keeping the high quality that we know and love. Or maybe they just want to maximize profits and changed the quality just cause they can...but for whatever reason it is, I will not be purchasing this again unless they go back to the original formula. Iu2019ve gotten better sponges at Walmart for a 1/4 of the price."

I've used it for cream contour in the past and it was great for applying and blending that as well.  To help it dry after usage, I bought an egg cup and it works quite well.

I love my real techniques sponge and find that they both work pretty much the same producing the same result. However I do reach for my beauty blender more, probably because it has a more precise tip than the real techniques. But when I travel I reach for my real techniques one and never bring my bb. In general when I travel I take the cheaper option so I donu2019t feel bad when it gets lost or damaged. Overall this beauty blender is a wonderful tool to have. I strongly recommend washing properly after every single use.. itu2019s a sponge and sponges harbor bacteria and germs. Iu2019ve used shampoo and it works but definitely requires elbow grease. I do prefer the beauty blender solutions specifically the solid formula. I recommend looking out for beauty blender deals which they have peppered in all year round but usually during the holidays the big daddy deals come out. I think itu2019s a little ridiculous to pay $20 per sponge."

The sponge I got was not nearly as soft as my real techniques sponges, and did not blend out my concealer well at all. I tried different levels of dampness and could not get it to work. I think I used it twice and went right back to the Real Techniques. I honestly would not recommend anyone spend $20 on this when there are great alternatives for less than half that."

Me personally I find that I get more coverage and use less product using a brush and then the beauty blender.

I got another at Christmas and I've probably only used it about 15 times, and when I picked it up a few days ago I discovered that there's black mould throughout the pores of the pink sponge!! I have a black pro BB sponge that's still in good condition but now I'm worried to continue using it because if it actually were mouldy I'd have no idea. I'd really like to buy a sponge with the assurance that it will perform as good as the one I bought 5 years ago."

The contrast between both this product and those sponges is so significant and extremely positive for the Beauty Blender; it takes less time and effort to apply the same amount of product! This is definitely going to be a staple product for me and I recommend it completely! I did picture it being a bit bigger than it actually was, but it still gets the job done so I can't complain! Amazing product overall."

I rinsed and squeezed it so many more times, and still had pink dye pouring into my sink... I don't want pink dye staining my skin, and I don't want the concealer that refuses to come out to be a breeding ground for bacteria... I can't fathom how a company is fine with charging this much money for such a terrible product, nor can I understand how Beauty blender is the gold standard for make up sponges. Do yourself a favor and get a better quality, more affordable sponge... Sephora brand sponges from now on for me."

The reason I love this sponge is because it's got a wonderful bouncy texture and that's perfect for a sponge. It's also easy to maneuver because it's not too big, so it can really get into the creases under your eye. Youu don't need to buy both mini sponges and the regular ones because this product can do every job. I love that it's not big and goofy, but its big enough to really get around your cheeks as well. You can really get a wonderful makeup application and I don't mind that sponges absorb some of the product because it keeps you from putting too much on your face, it offers a more natural look. I use both sponges and brushes. I like to use this for concealer and foundation, as well as other cream products. $20 is a lot for a sponge but it's worth it. I recommend buying two, one in pink and the other in black. You replace them every 3 months."

I made sure to skin prep, moisturize, use primers. I tried dampening the sponge, wetting the sponge, applied the makeup from behind my hand to my face, applied makeup directly to my face from the bb, etc. just so many combinations! The end result would always be patchy with streaks on my skin and not at all medium coverage. Plus Iu2019ve noticed I had to use more foundation than normal with the beauty blender as opposed to when Iu2019m using a foundation brush.

My suggestion is do not even rest your  BBlender sponge on the top after you finish as it just canu2019t breathe.

Then, it really seemed to dull the pigment. This gold is usually very bright and rich. To me, it appears really sad and washed out. - For foundation application: will never use again. Idk if itu2019s the damp blender or the foundation, but at first it seemed to apply nicely, but then what I noticed is that despite a light weight foundation, the product sat above my sink rather than actually blending in. It felt so strange I had to actually go back in with my foundation brush to fix it. - For my contouring and blush: I typically use a blender but dry. So i will use again but not wet. - I know itu2019s not the u201crightu201d way to use a beauty blender dry but honestly, I donu2019t care and I am not a fan of the damp blender in the slightest.

When handling the sponge after using it, it doesn't transfer product on my fingertips either from use which is helpful for mornings when I am trying to complete my routine quickly because it don't have to wipe my hands and stain the outer parts of my other products. I recently have been using the larger rounded section of the sponge for my face which I can dab into the smaller sections of my face like my nose and between my brow with ease while I use the pointed part of the sponge for dotting and blending my highlighter. I would purchase this product if it came in a value set, but it is not a holy grail makeup tool for me to purchase separately for 20 dollars."

It was a funny shape, expensive for a sponge, and unlike anything anyone had seen before, but all of the YouTube beauty gurus were raving about it.  Back then, I bought a little knockoff sponge from CVS, which I still have (not with me here in my DC apartment, unfortunately, or else Iu2019d provide a comparison photo). It was squishy, bouncy, and held water like it was supposed to, and it was half the price of the BeautyBlender. It was my favorite way to apply makeup for a while, before I discovered the RealTechniques buffing brush which changed my life forever.  So now, in 2019, is the BeautyBlender sponge worth it?  Ehu2026itu2019s worth it to buy an egg-shaped sponge, absolutely. Thereu2019s really nothing better than a wet sponge for liquid foundation application, if you ask me, if you have the time in the morning to wet a sponge and spend a minute or two sitting there and bouncing it on your face. Itu2019s not a part of my daily makeup routine because it takes too long and Iu2019m usually in a rush (hence, the buffing brush), but I like one for special occasions where I want my makeup to look really flawless.  I appreciate the BeautyBlender for being the first of its kind and totally revolutionary, but the thing is, you can buy similar makeup sponges Thereu2019s no reason in this case to buy name brand, if you ask me. Go buy a knockoff. Like I said, the CVS generic brand one is pretty good (or at least, it was when I was in 8th grade and I first bought it). As I hear, RealTechniques has a comparable makeup sponge too."

I have a makeup sponge from another brand that I love for blending foundation, but it's too big for concealing under my eyes. This one can do both and somehow elevates my foundation to a more beautiful finish than a brush. I tried that strange microfiber sponge from Juno, and it made any foundation that I used very matte. The beautyblender maintains the intended finish.   My only personal dislike for beautyblenders is that I'm all about a clean look, and no matter how well you clean it some stains will remain. Not a hygiene issue, just bothersome appearance wise.   Overall, it's a very efficient way to blend foundation (and concealer, cream highlight, cream bronzer, etc), and never leave me with streaks.   4 stars just because there are so many sponges on the market now and $20 is steep in comparison. I've read that you should replace the sponge every 3 months, so the price can add up. In comparison, the price of a brush stretches over a much longer time frame."

Squeeze out the excess liquid, using towel, I used the Bounce foundation, but u can use any foundation or any other complexion product across the face for flawless results, apply in a blotting formation and be sure to  Cleanse after each use with blendercleanser Solid, Solid works perfectly to clean the beauty blender as well as any makeup brushes it really helps to maintain the integrity of the blenderu2019s exclusive material. Replace your beautyblender every three months, and never miss a bounce. I know the beauty blender is pricey but I personally believe it is worth the results."

Down the line I had started trying other knock off versions of makeup sponges that seemed to do the trick without the heavy price point. After receiving a complimentary beautyblender a couple of weeks ago I noticed a drastic difference the name brand blender made. I really felt like the makeup sunk into my pores making them appear smaller. Less makeup was being wasted from soaking into the sponge as well. It really does give a canvas I donu2019t think any other brand can give you. Although the price point is almost $15 more that its drugstore competitors which can be a deal breaker in the long run."

I've been using this since it first came out and I have tried other sponges but nothing really compares to the original. The texture and bounce of. beauty blender is just unique and blends perfectly. I love how they come in different colors now too. I just wish they lasted for a bit longer because the price tag is pretty hefty for a sponge that you have to replace every couple months. There are definitely other sponges out there that are cheaper and work great, like the real techniques, but the original beauty blender is still the number one in my opinion it just works the best. It blends out foundation and concealer perfectly with no streaks and gives some hydration to the face while doing it too. I received this product as a complimentary product to test out for Influenster."

These products are so amazingly bad, I am just speechless. They were not cheap. Beauty blender costs $20 and the cleansing mitt also costs $20. So, I am out $40+tax+shipping, and all I can show for it is junk. The blender fell apart only after the FIRST cleansing attempt. And as you can see the makeup  residue is still there. Mind you I used their soap and their shampoo. And as you can see from my photo the mitt is also covered in residual makeup, meaning that water and soap will not wash it away! It just transfers from one serface (the beauty blender) to the other surface (the mitt). I wonder what is the purpose of soap and shampoo if it is still the same after the cleansing. This is only after one use. ONE SINGLE USE! I am blown away just how awful these products are. I used Sephora soap before on my brushes and cheap blender sponges, and they were amazing. But this time since this was my 1st Beauty Blender I wanted to take care of it properly and bought the cleansing mitt along with the soap and the shampoo from the same brand. I am very disappointed that the price-y products did not do anything. Just WOW. Do not buy this garbage. Donu2019t be a sucker like me."

One of the biggest issues I've had with other sponges is that it's impossible to have one for more than a couple weeks without them ripping.  I replace my BB every three months and I've never had one rip or tear at all.  I've also started apply powder with my BB, something I couldn't do with another sponge without it looking super cakey.

I liked the idea of not having to wash my hands after I applied my makeup but I still found I needed to use my fingertips to make everything look seamless so Iu2019m back to using my finger for the whole application. I also use much less product when I use my fingers since they donu2019t absorb all the product. So is money is a concern this is not for you. I was instructed how to use it but as you lightly tap it to your skin it pushed the product deeper into the sponge. I get much more natural results with much less product by lighting tapping my fingers over my skin. It is cute and comes in a nice little container that also works as a good place to put it to dry after you try to wash it. I also think since I canu2019t get all the product cleaned off of the surface of it there must be germs and product that gets stuck deep into the sponge that isnu2019t removable so it could cause some bad skin reactions for those of us who have sensitive skin and or like to keep clean any thing that is going near our eyes, lips, nose and mouth.

But I finally gave it a chance a few months ago and itu2019s really worth the price. I have the smaller sizes too for more control and visibility with liquid highlighter application.   The only reason I dock a star is that with this price it tag I think they could have found a dye for the signature color that didnu2019t come out in every single wash. The vivid green in the smaller ones doesnu2019t get washed out. If it was a limited edition color Iu2019d kinda understand it running when washed but their signature color I expect a better quality in the dye.

After buying blender cleanser solid, did not have an issue with this. In my opinion, buying a cleanser is required - beauty blender will without a doubt develop mold if a cleanser is not used.

It has a one of a kind soft airy spongy texture that absorbs the perfect amount of product then distributes it to the face in a way no other beauty sponge can. I have tried other makeup sponges that either absorb to much product then not release it back on the face when pouncing onto the skin. Or some that don't absorb product at all & you're just pushing the product around on your face to finish with this big streaky looking mess. $20 maybe expensive for one makeup sponge but my Beauty Blender does last me a good 6 months & that's me using it 5 to 6 days a week & washing it before & after every use. So that's me washing it 10-12 times a week & still Lasting a good 6 months. To me the $40 a year is worth it because the results are amazing. Yeah you can dupe it for maybe half the price but in the end you're spend more because the cheaper dupes don't last long, fall apart way to easily & don't have the texture as a Original Beauty Blender!"

It is still a sponge so it absorbs a lot of liquid foundation even when damp.  Which wastes a lot of the product. Also you have to apply foundation by bouncing the blender and not wiping, but it still seems to end up with more foundation on the sponge than my face. So while I do get very smooth coverage it's much lighter coverage than if I used my flat brush. It also takes a lot longer bouncing this little egg all over your face than just using a brush. To top it off its a bit time consuming having to clean it each time and dry it out. For what it does it should be half the price."

The product saves me time and embarrassment!!!   Also it's soft, the texture is perfect and light, so when i dab my face with it, my heavy handedness doesn't get in the way.   I waited a long time to try this because I thought it was a gimmick.   When I got a free sample, i tried it and now I'm a believer.   For those struggling with it, i highly recommend watching videos on how to use it for the best results, because this product does require some forethought/strategy before using on your face.

I can see why so many people adore this product, it hardly soaks up any foundation and gives a beautiful finish. I do however, like a very very natural look so when i use foundation I like to use the real techniques sponge which DOES soak up some product and sheers it out. The beauty blender paired with a bb or cc cream is a dream combination. The sponge applies the lightweight bb/cc cream in such a natural way but since no product is absorbed it will give you the most coverage out of anything."

I use it for my foundations as well as powders and it makes my makeup look better than it ever did with brushes. Brushes work great for some people but for me Iu2019m now a die hard beauty blender fan! I make sure I wash and dry my sponge properly after every use and replace every ~3 months. Iu2019ve never had a problem with the dye of the sponge or it removing my makeup while applying. Worth the money for me!"

Its not a five star product for me simply because I find that I can get the same effect from a specific much less expensive sponge. Yes, I'll likely buy again as I do like them, but for the significantly lower price of the competative orange sponge... I'll buy the orange one more often. This sponge lasts me for 3-5 months with weekly/semi-weekly cleaning before it gets too many small tears (full disclosure I have mid length natural nails that I don't think help the tear situation)."

Second, I don't generally use foundation or concealer, but when I do use it, I struggle with blending.  I found it much easier to get a hang of than brushes, which much better results, especially around the eyes.  The only reason I am not giving it 5 stars is cleaning.  There's no easy way to clean between products.  Also, I find the amount of pink coloring that comes out during cleaning...disconcerting."

I continued to clean it and let it dry and kept it bear a window to see if conditions would improve. No matter what I did the mold would not leave. Eventually i tried to pick the mold out, which just ended in a no longer usable beauty blender. I decided to just toss it. It was good when it lasted but not worth the money in my opinion.

I love using it with the liquid highlighter from Becca which I find can be difficult to spread with just a finger or brush. One of my main  complaint is that it seems absorbs more product than it applies which can be a bummer when you have an expensive product. My work around was applying the product with my fingers or brush and then blending away with the BB instead of dipping the BB into the product. Another complaint is that I feel it can be a bit delicate. I travel a lot and I do my make up in weird places and after maybe a week I found it ripping apart in my makeup bag. I just keep it in its little packaging after it dries off and itu2019s seems to be doing it good. Overall I think this is a good product, especially for newbies who are uncomfortable with blending away heavier products like full coverage foundation."

I really haven't been able to find a spring quite as soft and gentle as the BB. It applies my liquid foundations flawlessly, and since the sponge is damp, my skin gets some added moisture compared to a brush application. I'm blessed with rather clear clear skin, so I also love how the BB thins out fuller coverage foundation for a more dewy, natural finish. This is my favorite tool to apply concealer since it's tip fits perfectly under the eye. I knocked off one star because the BB stays rather small, compared to other sponges I've tried such as EcoTools and Sonia Kashuk. I wish it would be just a tad larger so application took less time, but since the results are flawless, I can't complain too much.   A new technique I've been trying thanks to the YouTube beauty community is applying powder to bake using a DRY BB. I find it more precise and less messy than applying with a brush or puff.   Overall, BB takes the 1st place prize for a beautiful finish and soft texture, but comes in second for size. 9/10 would recommend.   I got this product free for testing purchases."

I have been using Beautyblender's for a couple years now and they have to be the best beauty sponge I've tried. They evenly disperse the product leaving me looking airbrushed! I use them for foundation, concealer, liquid highlighter, baking and sometimes setting my whole face with powder. One dowfall is they seem to break down and get rips in them quicker than other sponges I've used. Another would be that they absorb more product than other sponges as well. Over all I think the pros outweigh the cons! I'd totally recommend these to anyone looking for a flawless finish!"

I love using for powders as well not just foundation. It excellent at setting under the eye without leaving excessive powder. I love using that trick to set because it also keeps my eye make up from running! The price is worth it! Itu2019s often replicated never duplicated.

I tried buying a cheap knockoff version when they first came out to see what all the hype was about and I was not impressed so I was not expecting my mind to change about how I feel about this product. First off - I did not know how to use it so I did not know that it should be damp before using it to apply any products and that you should bounce it on your skin instead of dragging it like you normally would with a brush. After reading the instructions on the package I used it the correct way and boy was I surprised. I normally use a flat kabuki brush to apply foundation because I love the flawless finish, but I used the Beauty Blender instead and I could not tell the difference! My skin looked as if it had been airbrushed - there was no harsh line around my face because everything was blended so well.  I would definitely use these products again and tell people all about them. I received this product for complimentary for testing purposes."

I, personally, have not had issues with my sponges tearing while using/washing. If I had to change anything, I would make the pointy end wider and flat (similar to the Eco Tools sponge) as I found a flat edge makes blending my concealer in just a hair easier, which is why Iu2019m giving a four star rating.

I was extremely impressed!  Plus they donu2019t soak up foundation like the ones Iu2019ve used previously.  I will still use my brushes occasionally, but for my foundation and concealer, I am definitely switching to this blender  because of the airbrush effect I get!    The mitt is also a must have for both brushes and the beauty blendersu2026 I was able to clean off all of my brushes way faster than using a regular cleanser without the mitt!

I quickly put it up against the cheap knock off I had purchased at a Walgreens that although looked similar, I quickly learned was not even close to the Beauty Blender. You can tell by first glance the original is made out of a much better material and the cheaper side part is literally just a larger chunk of those cheap pull off sponges your mom used. The BB Original also cut the product I use each application literally in half! I can cover my face to full coverage with one pass where with my old sponge I needed several. Another thing I like is that I can wash this several times and re-use it where as when washing my old sponge, it ripped and quickly showed that it holds on to that product its stealing from you!  This is an amazing beauty sponge and I now know and understand why it holds the titles it does.  -To learn more about the BBOriginal and see my full review, click here-----> https://youtu.be/Qf4M-3bPEvs"

The sponge provides a glowing look rather than streaking when I apply makeup with a brush, my fingertips, or a traditional makeup sponge. The beauty blender washes well and the packaging allows you to rest your blender in it and protect it from getting dirty on your vanity or countertop. My favorite thing about using the beauty blender to apply my makeup is that I find it requires less product than when I use a brush and I do not needs to use my fingertips and therefore do not get excess dirt and oil in my pores. The only thing I did not like about the beauty blender is that the color bleeds when I squeeze the excess water out of the sponge. I do not like the idea of having the fake coloring bleeding onto my skin. I received this product complimentary for testing purposes but have continued using it daily because I love it so much!"

Before using the Beauty Blender I was using Kevin Aucoin and Armani's foundation brushes. The difference with the Beauty Blender is that you can really control how much coverage you have, it doesn't create brushmarks or streaks, and is easy to clean.   I use it for both my foundation (liquid and airbrush) and under eye concealer as the tip makes getting into the corners of the eyes and around the nose easy with no missed spots. The best way to use it is either to apply your liquid foundation with your fingers first then bounce and/or roll the damp beauty blender to evenly distribute product. With the airbrush, I spray on my face then dab the beauty blender over my face before spraying product directly to the sponge and applying that to areas I want more coverage such as my nose.  If people are saying it eats up product, they're probably using the sponge dry; which of course will make it absorb the product which is why using it damp is so important. Also, be sure to clean your beauty blender with your keep.it.clean mitt or solid cleanser after each use to prevent the build-up of bacteria.   I received this product for free for testing purposes."

I typically wet the palm of my hand before dabbing the sponge in the excess water from my hand 2-3 times before dabbing makeup directly onto my face and using the sponge to blend it all together. I have found that this technique allows most of the makeup to remain on my skin instead of the sponge. I have tried other make up sponges, but found the texture to be much harder (the beauty blender really is super fluffy and soft), so the makeup is more harshly rubbed into my face with these."

The softness of the sponge, the carefully constructed design that reaches in places as delicate and hard to reach like the inner corners of my eyes and side of my nose, and the consistency all blew me away. I am truly impressed, my only wish is that it could be more affordable! Thanks to influenster for the complimentary testing!"

But the beauty blender works so well blending in foundation, applying cream contour or cream highlight, as well as using for baking and other things. I especially love it for baking under my eyes, as the tip is perfect to get in the corners! The shape also make it replay easy to blend my concealer as well.  I didnu2019t have any trouble cleaning my beauty blender at all. The sponge is really easy to clean with the blender cleanser solid. It is by far the best sponge and brush cleaner Iu2019ve used and is now the only cleanser I use for my makeup tools. The keep.it.clean also make it really easy to get makeup out of my sponges and brushes. Previously, I was using a silicon fave scrubber to clean my brushes, but the keep.it.clean is a great size to make and makes is a lot faster to clean my tools.   However, if you cannot afford a beauty blender, the knock off ones on amazon or the sponges from realtechniques also work well! And for cleaning, baby shampoo also works wonders for cleaning brushes and sponges!"

I tried some basic sponges in the past and just didn't find it apply as well as my brushes. I wasn't a bliever in the beauty blender I thought a sponge is a sponge but I was wrong!! I now can't apply foundation without it. It gives such a nice even coverage, that is never cakey because it will soak up excess foundation but not so much that you don't get enough coverage. It also makes me skin the most comfortable and thins out my foundation so it doesn't have that cakey feeling. 10/10 would recommend!!!! It's worth it."

Do I need to say more? I agree that the red carpet beauty blender was not that good. But come on, this one is the best. You have to agree. You just don't like it because its a little expensive. But to me its an investment. Lasts quite long. And I have never faced any issue with this product. So love love love it.  I did receive a bunch of beauty blender from Influenster for testing purposes and I am grateful. I am all set for this year.

It is the best one Iu2019ve used, but the price deters me from buying them. The real techniques sponge is close in texture and blendability, but the quality isnu2019t as nice. However itu2019s a more affordable option. Just make sure with any beauty sponge that you wet the sponge by letting it soak up water under the faucet, then squeezing it until it is only damp. This will give you the best application!  I received this product for free to review from Influenster."

They did not get as big as the  L'Oru00e9al ones, which I liked. It did not feel like there was access water in it, so that was a huge plus!  I used one beauty blender for my foundation and one for my concealer and setting powder. A damp beauty blender is so perfect for pressing setting powder into the skin. It also gets right up in the inner corners. This is my first time trying the setting powder with a damp beauty blender. I wanted to use the beauty blender for multiple things and I love that I did!  I love the mitt! I have something like it but it is bulky, and when it gets wet it slides off of my hand. The mitt from beauty blender is so user friendly! Your fingers go right in the slots so you can have a better grip and more control. The solid cleanser was nice. I prefer liquid cleansers though, they lather more. That is just personal preference. It did smell amazing though! It was like a light lavender perfume smell. It was not overpowering or anything. You had to put it up to your nose to smell it.   I received this product for free for testing purposes from Influenster and beautyblender!"

It makes building the coverage of liquid foundations ten times easier, saving you plenty of time to play with eyeshadows. So why only 4 stars?

Itu2019s just that I continuously reach for it, over my Real Technique beauty sponge, because sometimes I really do see a difference. Idk if the different colors do different things, but the one sucky thing about the pink one is it kinda bleeds when I wash it. Like, itu2019ll get clean, but this residual pink color continues to rinse out. No big deal, it doesnu2019t change the way it applies. My makeup looks soooo flawless when I use the beauty blender, just like any sponge, I just feel more extra when I use the beauty blender lol. I say if you have the money, buy it. You definitely wonu2019t regret it. My one tip is to just make sure your animals canu2019t reach it- Iu2019ve lost a few beauty blenders to my cat and dog haha.

A few weeks ago, while perusing the makeup counters at Sephora, I was re-introduced to the world of makeup sponges with a BeautyBlender recommendation. Still hesitant, I explained why I prefer applying my foundation with my trusty fingers. Fortunately for me, the expert makeup artist I was chatting with insisted that I give it a try. She went over all the advantages to using the BeautyBlender and explained why itu2019s completely different than all the others. Here is a quick recap of why every woman needs to own one of these miracle spongesu2026 -Will not absorb your makeup -Gives an airbrush finish -Allows you to layer your foundation easily -Gives a dewy look -Cleans easily -Has multiple uses (can be used with concealer, eyeshadow, lotion, etc)."

Worth the $20  xSay goodbye to cake face, and hello to flawless  - First, you wet the sponge and squeeze out excess water.  Then you put liquid foundation on the back of your hand and dab it onto your face with the sponge.  Then you use the long edge of the sponge, and with a bouncing up and down motion, you blend the make-up into your skin.   I love this new sponge! The sponge becomes a little discolored with your makeup over time so be sure to clean it regularly! Best recommended replacing the sponge every 3 months!"

It definitely gets dirty but if you use the solid blender cleanser and clean it regularly then it can last a good amount of time (5-6 months).

It is perfect for foundation (I used Too Faced in the shade Porcelain) and together they are just perfect. The big round end is great for over your entire face and the pointed top is awesome for smaller details, like under the eyes. It is also amazing for other things, such as blush. I recently tried my first creme (as opposed to powder) blush, with the beauty blender, it is amazing. At first, I wasn't sure -- $20 on a SPONGE? But I got a cheaper dupe and fell in love with that, so decided to try the real thing. The real thing is even better than the dupes. I love my beauty blender so much I could cry"

Well at least it's a magic sponge I guess haha. Another thing, yes it does soak up a bit of product, but a brush will do the same thing, AND probably look streaky.

It is miles softer and less dense than the Quo purple hourglass sponge, especially after it was reformulated a year or so ago. I haven't tried the Real Techniques sponge, the Elf sponge, or the Eco Tools sponge. It is softer than every no-name sponge I have tried from Winners.  It blends product beautifully, and doesn't lift foundation when blending concealer unlike the Quo hourglass sponge. I loved it a lot. Especially with a 'press and roll' motion around the eyes. Lovely!   Unfortunately my cat destroyed it. The only thing she's ever done that to. I'm still trying to figure out if I want to repurchase or not.  Let me know if there's a comparable option that is easily available in Canada for less!"

Itu2019s perfect for concealing and even works with baking my eyes and creating defined lines on my face with my Laura Mercier powder (for contouring.) Nikkietutorials on Youtube really got me into beauty sponges.  The only reason Im giving Beautyblender a 4 star is because I had 2 of mine break within a week. One was even leaking pink, which is DEFINITELY not good for the face. However, I like it because itu2019s much squishier than my Morphe sponge (which is a bit more stiff, but instead is sturdier and never leaked color.)  I still gave Beautyblender a try and got a new one and go back and forth between my Morphe sponge and Beautyblender!"

I have more brushes and makeup applicators than I can count.  This, by far, is my favorite.  I use them to blend concealer under my eyebrows and under my eyes.  They seamlessly blend my makeup.  I also use them to set my concealer with powder.  I bought the mini's today too to see if I can improve setting my concealer with a smaller version of the Beauty Blender.   Although a little pricey, I couldn't do my makeup without them.  Easy to clean and easy to use.  Top notch and a must-have staple for any makeup lover!"

            "review_text": "I waffled on this for a long time. I used the Real Techiniques Miracle Complexion Sponge for a couple years because I watched numerous videos comparing it favorably as a dupe. However, the RT sponge breaks up and splits way too quickly for my liking (sometimes it would take a month or so, other times after a few washes - and I am gentle!), so I finally bit the bullet. It was completely worth it!   The Beautyblender is more bouncy and less dense. It applies foundations that I find tricky with my fingers or a brush much better than the RT. I don't find myself missing the flat side of the RT sponge either, which surprised me. And, bonus, this cleans so much easier than the RT sponge, and I don't worry that it's going to start splitting. I use the SheaMoisture African Black Soap bar, which works effectively and gently. I've tried many other cheaper alternative sponges that Influencers rave about since, and I still haven't found anything that I love more. I can't see myself every going back to another sponge. There are still products that apply better with fingers or a brush, but for a sponge, nothing beats the BeautyBlender.   The only downside is that for many washes it bleeds pink when I clean it. It doesn't effect my foundation (it only bleeds when I use soap), but I don't like the idea that there's so much dye in there. I will probably switch over to the nude and black BeautyBlenders from now on if they retain the same texture."

The first beauty blender I bought was a hot pink one, and every time after applying my foundation, I always thought my face looks like a pumpkin. I thought it was because my foundation, I changed to hourglass, double wear, Bobbi brown, and it always ended up looking like a mess. Every time I talk to people works in Sephora, they all suggested me to use Beautyblender. I got this package for a while now, and this is the first time I used a cup of water to damp my beauty blender because I was at a friendu2019s dorm. Hehehe, the water turned yellow when I dip the nude colored one!!!!!! So I changed to the hot pink one, and that cup of water looked like grape fruit juice!!! So I decided to only use the hourglass foundation brush, and my skin did not look like a pumpkin this time."

Itu2019s definitely not u201clike any other ordinary spongeu201d as some people have commented. This product is basically genius. Itu2019s a light/soft, but dense, sponge that blends smoothly like no other - no streak marks or cakey looks. It cleans well too and doesnu2019t need to be dried out before using. Iufe0f hate having to clean my brushes and other sponges and wait for a day or two for them to dry. The nice thing about the beautyblender is that it actually works best when itu2019s damp. Iufe0f will 100% be sticking with the beautyblender."

I've been using the Original pink one for years, and yes, you have to be careful with it or it will tear easily while wetting or cleaning it. My suggestion is to allow the water to soak into it while sitting in a mug of water next to the sink. Then take it out and squeeze it between your palms, not in one hand where your nails can dig in. Do this once or twice and it should be fully absorbed with water. Once full, squeeze water out with a towel and you're all set!  Another thing I noticed is that the Beauty Blender Pro (the black sponge) tends to be a bit smaller, but also more durable and less apt to getting holes or tearing. I also noticed that it doesn't get as big, even when wet but it works just as well.  What I love about this simple looking little sponge is that it allows me to use less makeup while getting a seamless finish. I'm able to use the pointed end to apply concealer to my eyelids (my preferred eye primer) perfectly and evenly without tugging at the delicate skin around the eye. I'm also able to blend foundation and concealer together perfectly for a seamless transition with minimal increasing under my eyes. And although I don't bake (I'm 46 years old), I sometimes will use the sponge to add translucent powder or highlighter to my face and it gives the perfect finish! The suggested replacement on these is every 3 months, however if you are very good at cleaning yours every time you use it and storing it in a covered place, like a drawer or something (after it's fully air dried, of course), I think it will last way longer than that. Mine certainly have!!"

            "review_text": "so I don't wear foundation every day. I wear it at most once a week, and sometimes less often. I absolutely love the way the beauty blender makes my foundation look. it doesnt absorb product so I'm using less foundation than other sponges and it goes on flawlessly. but now there are black spots on my blender which has been confirmed to be mould.   The woman at Sephora explained that the blender will get mould if not stored at proper temperatures and in dry places, without being contained in anything. When I bought it they said it would be fine to store in the container it comes in but without the lid which is what I've been doing. now they tell me that's wrong. She explained that the blender should be replaced every 3 to 4 months regardless of mould or not. and apparently sometimes there is mould inside and you don't even see it!!   So now I'm hesitant about whether or not I should buy another one because to spend 30$ on something I only used about 10 - 15 times is a waste of money. My friend's blender is completely beige/brown now and mine is still pink except the bottom and the point. it hasn't been used much.   So if you plan on getting it, cleaning it with the soap bar that they sell is a must! she said it reduces the risk of mould by a lot. you have to wash ir after every use. and do not store it in a ziplock bag, plastic container, anywhere enclosed, or anywhere humid. and if you've had it forever, replace it, and keep replacing it every 3 months. As soon as you notice little black dots (almost barely noticeable at first) your blender is finished so check it every so often because it's very easy to miss it and no one wants to be putting mould on their face."

They really mean it when they say there is no true dupe for Beauty Blender. It blends like a dream. No streaks like a brush and no patches like a cheap sponge. It's more sheer than a brush, but depending on the foundation you can build coverage easily. I wash mine with BB solid soap after every use to get the most out of it. I subtracted a star because it can lacerate fairly easily when wet, and when it lacerates it doesn't work very well. It takes on water differently and it has soaked up a massive amount of foundation that I can't wash out. I will be more delicate with my next sponge."

Even with some cuts, it works. Other than that, they last a long time for the money and I will always have one in my makeup supplies to use. Get a cute stand too and it will always have a place on your vanity. If they get too old and get gross on the outside over time, just cut it in half to maximizes your uses out of it.

You can definitely build it up with the beauty blender just takes a bit more time.

Or, if I overdid it i can use it to blend it out a bit more.   Beauty Blender is great tool, you just got to see how It fits your routine.

The only downside is that it does easily absorb quite a lot of foundation, so I usually have to use more foundation than usual to achieve the coverage I want (foundation brushes does a better job at higher coverage, but I don't really like the streaky finish), as well as making it a tad bit difficult to clean the sponge (since I don't clean it often or maybe I am just cleaning it wrong lol) Anyways, this product does its job well, but the price makes me slightly unlikely to repurchase often."

It might have to do with the way I apply foundation (when I still used foundation)...I was getting great results with using a flat top brush and the beautyblender simply added to my application time and had zero effect on the finish, lasting powder, etc. I used for a good few months and gave it a fair chance, but I always just found that I preferred to reach for my brushes. Perhaps it's because I prefer light coverage foundations and BB creams, and you simply don't need a beautyblender for these.   Instead of the 1-2 pumps of foundation that I needed with a brush, the beautyblender absorbed more product and I found that the usual amount wasn't enough.  The beautyblender was also more labour intensive to clean compared to brushes. With my brushes, I use a daily brush cleaner and am done in 2 minutes (along with a full shampoo wash every 2 weeks), whereas a beautyblender takes a lot more water to clean daily. I simply could not use a sponge that's not clean so cleaning this weekly, or even every other day is not an option.   If this works for you, great! Im happy that you've found something that works well. This simply isn't worth the cost for me. For the cost of 3 beauty blenders (which would last up to 9 months if you're lucky...and depending on how well you keep it clean for) I can buy a good quality brush that can last me years."

It just completely melts the product into the skin and creates a seamless line so you cannot tell where the concealer begins and ends. It's also great for spreading out product, and building it. It's extremely easy to use and if you clean it properly and regularly you can use the same one for 4 months! it's also the only tool I use to apply my translucent powder. Because of the sponge being wet- it presses the powder into the skin and then the moisture makes it look more like skin, instead of powder.

You basically need to clean this sponge after every use, especially if you are using liquid products to avoid bacteria buildup, which could lead to breakouts. Granted I also clean my foundation brushes after every application, but brushes are significantly easier to clean."

Anyways, I think there's a difference among the different BB and the pink one seems drier to me almost. I'll wet it right before makeup and about 10 mins will go by and by the time I go to blend out my foundation, the sponge is like completely dry. It still works but I find this doesn't happen with the nude or black one as much. Black is my favorite of the lot."

This sponge, however, smooths out foundation and leaves a natural look. I've been using the BB daily and have repurchased and will continue to do so!"

Only downfall to this sponge that I have found that has not happened while using other sponges is that it can get moldy after a while and they're not really affordable to be buying often. I would take really good care of it and let it completely dry before storing it away to avoid this problem. Other than that, I HIGHLY recommend this!"

From someone who has bought many different sponges (Forever21, e.l.f., Real Techniques, and other brands) I realized spending $20 on a beauty blender is a really good investment. Other sponges I have used either moved my foundation around, soaked up A LOT of my foundation, or enlarged my pores. This beauty blender doesn't. The only con is that it does soak up some foundation (not as much as other sponges) but it's sponge so it would only make sense for it to do that.   Make sure you wash your beauty blender often. By that, I do not mean just rinse. I used up the solid cleanser from beauty blender very quickly so an alternative way is to just use body shampoo, massage it in the sponge, and wash the body shampoo out. You'll see a lot of product and foundation come out."

The only thing that sort of turned me off was that when I was washing this after use there was a crazy amount of neon pink water in my sink.  Not sure if colouring the sponge affects the performance but if it doesn't I would love for the company to save us a dollar and skip the colour (unless that's what the nude blender is for I haven't checked out that page yet).  One other note: I've read some reviews that people have little tears in their sponges from washing with the company's liquid soap and pump dispenser.  I use a bar of mild soap and I think this might be a better way to avoid putting your sponge in contact with small rough edges (ie. little plastic nibs)"

I cleaned it often and thoroughly but the nature of the material is that it's meant to be used for a shorter period of time than a brush.

It's like I have to keep replacing them. They will either rip and tear or mold. Now I bought a BRAND NEW ONE again cause the last one molded no big deal it was time to replace it anyways it was the three month mark. So I used the brand new one today no problems and when I was done with it I put it on top on the container it came in like I always do. So I come home and wash it and I keep scrubbing it and scrubbing it with the beauty blender solid cleanser. There's black and it WONT COME OFF! I'm completely upset and disappointed after one time using it and it molded. Idk it's of my new foundation I'm using or beauty blender changed their sponges or something cause this did not happen before! I use to go a week of not washing the beauty blender and it just sitting there and I washed it and it would be fine! I will be looking into new alternatives."

The first time I used this I wasn't really impressed - my foundation looked really blotchy and not blended in. Then I followed the proper instructions to bounce this lightly on my skin and WOW I never thought my foundation could look this smooth and flawless. It was a level of airbrushed that I didn't even imagine was possible.   It also works great for precise application of blush and highlight, but is a bit too big for good contour application.  -1 star because of how fragile it is. The first time I washed it (gently), it got a little tear in it although that doesn't seem to affect its blending ability. Also, the dye bleeds whenever I wash it even though it's been washed daily for over a month now.  I'l almost sad at how great this works because it's pretty pricey. A good brush lasts forever but the BB only last 3 months...sigh."

Now when I try to use a foundation brush and see the application not look as blended as it does with beauty blender I immediately put the brush down. The only downside is I feel like I need to wash it everyday and it's hard to wash right after use when you are putting makeup on in a hurry before work. It also doesn't hold up too well after several washes. I've repurchased several of these just to keep things sanitary so that's one drawback. Brushes are definitely easier to maintain, but the application is flawless always so I will always be a beauty blender junkie no matter what."

Not to mention, it's fun to use and cute to look at. :)   There are a few cons for me;  1) it absorbs a lot of makeup compares to other methods of application.   2) The original Beauty blender is kind of too big for the small nooks and corners such as under eyes, but that is why Beauty blender comes in smaller sizes. I find the Beauty blusher to be wonderful.   3) Bright color Beauty blenders tend to bleed quite a bit. I have my hot pink Beauty blender for months and months and it still bleeds every time I wash it. (I wash it after each use) If this bothers you, I recommend using the nude or white color.  4) If you have long sharp nails, you're likely to tear it, so be careful ladies. :)  All the cons aside, I still love my Beauty blender. I will never stop buying it. It gives the most natural and the most flawless finish to my makeup. It's worth every penny."
