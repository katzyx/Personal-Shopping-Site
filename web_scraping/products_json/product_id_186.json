There is zero burn or minty feel and the smell is waxy. If you're hoping for a balm with similar plump to lip venom, duck plump, or any of those...This isn't it.

I love how easily it applies, how soft it leaves my lips, and best of all- its plumping power plus the PH adjusting color! I have tried several shades and they are all equally as flattering for my tan-olive skin tone! I have coworkers with different skin tones who have also tried this balm and the shades suit them very well too! I love how it doesn't burn or feel uncomfortable like other plumping products and that it hydrates my lips so well. I like to use this as my daily balm, whether I'm going for a natural makeup look,  or prepping  my lips for a matte lipstick, this balm is my go to! One tube lasts so long because it's thick too! Definitely a staple lip product!"

This is a very subtle product; I did notice a slight shift in my lip color and a hint of plumping but nothing compared to the photos advertised. The balm itself was hydrating and the plumping effect felt like a cool mint versus the unpleasant bee-sting lip plumping experience some products have.   I would be happy with the Power-full Plump Lip Balm if it were sold on the lower end of the drugstore spectrum (and ideally without the packaging mishap), since my expectations would be for a hydrating product that might add some color. But for a Buxom product at this price point? I'm not sold."

Now for the important part- it actually works! I use it every other night underneath the Too Faced Lip Injection Lip Plumping Gloss and in the morning my lips look stunning. (On the other nights I use the Langine Sweet Candy Lip Mask.) It also adds a very nice tint. Iu2019m pretty sure it has something in it that reacts to the PH of your skin because when I use it, it completely changes color. It gets darker pink but definitely not too dark (if you think it will be too dark on you, my favorite color is pastel pink, so I donu2019t just have a taste for dark colors!) Definitely recommend!"

I have very dry lips and this product is one of the very few that do not dry out my lips. Even some of the better lipsticks, make my lips flake and I can't figure out why b/c I exfoliate enough and my lips are not chapped.  This balm makes my lips feel super moisturized, making them look really healthy and It lasts long as well.  It also has a nice cooling effect and makes my lips look full. It's fantastic and I cannot say enough good things about all 3 of the colours.  The price is reasonable for what it is. Btw, this is my first ever review!!"

I originally got the Inner Glow/nude shade but it was very terracotta and somehow lighter than my actual lip color and not very flattering so I exchanged it for the clear-to-pink. My lips typically dry out with any of the your custom color lip products, but not this one. The product is round and fat, much larger than your normal tinted lip balm so it's super easy and fast to apply. There is a slight minty tingling sensation for maybe 30 minutes after application but it fades and isn't distracting or painful. The resulting color on me is a nice berry pink, not a hot pink. It feels really comfortable and cushiony on the lips and seems to last for a long time. I'm super happy with this! I own a million lip products but continue to reach for this after buying it in early November. Highly recommend!"

It also leaves a horrible bright pink stain even after using a makeup wipe and washing my face. It feels nice, it's not sticky and it's otherwise nice especially when applying but beware of the color if you are looking for something natural or light because this is not it unfortunately.

Theyu2019re not as intense as the lip glosses and I wasnu2019t expecting them to be since they are a lip balm. Theyu2019re more of a subtle color and tingle but they keep my lips soft and moisturized. Most of the time, Iu2019m wearing a mask at work, but I like that this balm has some lasting power plus color for when Iu2019m off work and can finally take off my mask. Iu2019m fact, I bought two colors - Big O and Inner Glow. Love them both! Definitely recommend this product."

You know the color guards for self tanners that make you look bronzed immediately if needed? I love that this lip balm adds a layer of color while also leaving a bit of tint behind so my lips look naturally more rosy and even immediately (unlike the Dior lip glow in both rosewood and original pink which take some time to develop color on my lips and the darker outline of my lip is visible until then)  Love the slight minty scent and feel, although it doesnu2019t really plump. It gives color to my lips and is buildable without getting thick or slipper.   Hydration wise, it doesnu2019t dry my lips but it isnu2019t super moisturizing either (Iu2019ll sometimes layer a thicker moisturizer over for added sheen as well). Itu2019s comfortable enough that I donu2019t need to carry another lip balm.

The subtly pink hue that it creates (I chose the Big O color) looks natural or can get more color the more you apply and it really does plump up the lips! My lips look fuller, feel moisturized and have a hint of color, total win. I also like the container and round shape they created, it goes on effortlessly, no mirror required. It will definitely last a long time. I have already bought two so I always have one w me. Definitely a must make up routine item!"

When you put it on there is a minty cool like feeling it leaves on your lips, and it Moisturized my lips so they werenu2019t dry. My only complaints really are that 1. I canu2019t really tell if there is any color on my lips (Iu2019m not sure if it was made for it not to leave color on the lips or not but I was expecting pink on my lips) and 2. It didnu2019t plump my lips as much as I would have wanted (the other product I tried left me with huge lips while this one was a bit subtle).

It's still a good balm and for how much is in the tube, it's actually not a bad buy.  Especially because it does manage layer without creating build up so I do like that factor.  I just don't like that it doesn't plump or fill in lines at all, which was my entire purpose for getting a plumping-balm in the 1st place."

Aside from the colour change, it didnt feel like it was very plumping, as they claim. I didn't notice a difference in my lips, and the tingling only lasted a few seconds. It also didnt feel very moisturizing. My $15 Glossier balm lasts way longer than this $24 balm. It just felt like a basic lip balm that you could get at walmart for $5.   If the tint didn't look so awful on me, I would probably continue to use it - but wouldn't repurchase."

Also it left my lips dry so not high on the hydration level. To me lip balm fits in your pockets, and hydrates and this didn't do that. It's more like a lip tint/lipstick.

Secondly, the stick is super wide and short, so itu2019s not very easy to use. The balm tingled a little but  didnu2019t visibly plump my lips, and it made them suuuuper crusty. The only thing redeemable about this balm is the color, which is like what clueless boys think lips naturally look like. It didnu2019t absorb into my lips at all, and just felt weird.

I put this on and then a sheer lip gloss and my lips look so healthy, plump and kissable. I feel so sexy and can't help but pout a little when I wear this. I will use this until I'm dead! I hope they never stop making this product. It helps me eliminate the lines in my lips to create the perfect pout. Makes all my lipstick and gloss applications perfect!!! And the best thing is that it doesn't irritate or harm my lips in anyway. I will even wear this to bed. Safe to wear every day, all day.

Overall not my favorite but it can be a good lip balm to use when my lips are already hydrated and I just want a pop of color."

The tingling isn't too intense and the minty smell/taste is lovely. It does a good job smoothing out my lips. The pink is a bit more intense than what it looks like on the model if you're like me and your lips already have a pink hue. The only issue with this balm is the size. It's too big to go in my pocket and takes up twice as much room as a typical lip balm in my purse."
