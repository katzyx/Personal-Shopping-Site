            "review_text": "I have sensitive, combination skin and have been using the Peace Out Pore Perfecting Stick for a little over three weeks now. At first, I was pumped to use this product because it was made for my skin type and promised to reduce pores, oiliness, and uneven texture - perfect! The stick form made it easy to apply and there was no unpleasant fragrance used so there were even more positives. The problem began when I first applied the product. According to the instructions, I can use the exfoliator on dry or damp skin, so I chose damp just to be safe. The product immediately felt very abrasive and harsh on my skin, so I applied more water and used my fingers to spread the product on my nose. It was better, but it defeated the purpose of having the exfoliator in stick form. The product dried down fairly quickly, which I liked, but rinsing it off felt just as abrasive as before and was uncomfortable. I did end up with a smoother nose, but it felt like it wasn't worth it. I have tried to use the Pore Perfecting Stick multiple other times since then, but the result always ends up the same - unsatisfied. I would only recommend this product if you know your skin can handle harsh physical exfoliators.   *I received this product for free from Topbox Marketing for testing and review purposes*"

            "review_text": "This is a really unique product as you can use it as an exfoliating cleanser or a face mask. I prefer to use it as a face mask because it has been more effective at unclogging my pores and improving texture that way. I love that it is in a solid stick form so my hands don't get messy when I apply it. It is easy to just swipe on, wait 10 minutes and then rinse off. I have both dry and acne prone skin. This mask helps with removing flaky skin and reducing acne/clogged pores at the same time but because my skin type is dry, I find I can only use this once a week. After I rinse it off it makes my skin feel so smooth without being tight. I have enjoyed using it as a part of my nighttime routine but I also think that for the price it should be more than 15g of product.

One minute I can use it as a quick cleanser to target blackheads on my nose, and the next I can swipe it on and leave it as a mask for a deeper clean. The formula is surprisingly gentle u2013 it's creamy and glides on easily, unlike some masks that feel harsh. Plus, it rinses clean without leaving my skin feeling dry or stripped. My pores appear minimized, and my skin feels overall smoother and clearer. The stick form is so convenient too, perfect for travel or quick touch-ups.  If you're looking for a product that can help with blackheads and keep your pores in check, I highly recommend giving this one a try! Just a heads-up, while it's been gentle on my skin, it might be worth a patch test first if you have sensitive skin because of the exfoliating ingredients.  received this product for free from Topbox Marketing for testing and review purposes."

            "review_text": "I like to cleanse my pores at least once a week.  The stick looks quite deceiving - it looks like a deodorant stick or lip balm but it has to be applied to the skin directly from it - I was shocked at how easily it glides on to the skin. Spreading it is also very easy and it felt really good while exfoliating.   I applied it on my nose and my t-zone where I tend to get more blackheads the first time I used it. It spread like a regular scrub when mixed with water and cleansed my pores easily and while I felt the beads on my skin, it didn't leave my skin looking or feeling scratched like other scrubs often do. My skin looked and felt clean and softer after I washed it off my face.   The instructions say it can also been used as a face mask which I've tried and it works to give an even deeper clean to clogged pores.   I like how my skin looks and feels clean yet hydrated after using the stick in either method of application and I love the convenience of being able to carry it in my purse without the worry of it spilling out into it. I definitely  recommend this product.    I received the Peace Out Pore Perfecting Stick from Topbox for free to try & give my honest opinion."

Dried off my face, leaned in to look in the mirror and... it was completely clear. I have since tried this as an all over face mask, with the same results. I routinely use acids as chemical exfoliants but I have never experienced such awesome results. I will be keeping this product in my arsenal asa weekly mask. An absolute must try.

After a couple weeks my pores are smaller, I have much fewer blackheads and many of my milia white lumps have exfoliated away without causing large scabbing holes like they have with other exfoliators. I recommend the Peace Out line of products for sure. Before this I was using Cerave and Clean&Clear products, but these have converted me from the drug store brands.

In terms of the quality of the actual formula, the exfoliation you get is very good, the particles are small and coarse, you cover every inch of your skin. After massaging it in, I did feel like my face was sufficiently exfoliated but for some, I could see this product being way too abrasive for their skin (mine is pretty good at handling intense treatments). I wouldn't recommend this for people with sensitive skin unless you are very gentle with messaging. Overall, my pores felt cleaner and smaller but I do not think the results are worth the price point."

It's like a little exfoliating, pore cleaning stick. I used it twice a week, on my exfoliating nights.  After cleansing my face, I really went in with this on my trouble areas where my pores are clogged.  It felt very rough but in a good way. I left it on my trouble areas for about 10 minutes. I didn't feel like it did anything. But honestly, when I took it off, my face felt so squeaky, clean and smooth. Visually, I didn't see much of a difference after only the first night, but I did a little bit after the second night. It made my skin a little red after using, but it's because I was really getting in there and scrubbing with it. I can't wait to see the long-term results of this product. It had a very subtle, clean scent. Almost no scent at all.  I have really dry skin everywhere and eczema and this time of year gets really bad on my face especially, and because of how exfoliating this product felt on my face I was worried it was going to really dry it out so right after I applied some hyaluronic acid serum and 100% aloe vera right after. The next day my face was still smooth. Love this. #freeproduct"
