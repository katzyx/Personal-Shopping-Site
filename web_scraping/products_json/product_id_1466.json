Heavy creams never sink into my skin but this one does. It made my angry skin calm, plump and healthy looking. Are there other ones that can do the same thing for cheaper? Probably, but I havenu2019t found one and Iu2019ve tried hundreds of products to the point the Sephora employees probably qualify as my u201cfriend squadu201d at this point. lol!

Turns out itu2019s a face cream. Whatever.. my logic is you can tell a persons age by their hands and their u201ccrows feetu201d. I prefer the term eye smiles because smiles are prettier than feet. Anyways, after using the product for its (non) and intended purposes, I noticed a difference after 2-3 uses. Iu2019m 33 y/o so my fine lines are definitely there, but after use I could barely see them. I have combo skin and it didnu2019t seem to matter with this product. The fine lines were diminished and it almost gives a tightening sensation. Almost as if youu2019d put a thin layer of Elmeru2019s glue (but without the peeling). Definitely feels like itu2019s tightening, noticeable difference, and combo-skin friendly. Only 2 complaint are my husband is about to gripe about how much itu2019s going to cost to keep my skin looking supple and firm due to its steeper price, and the mature lady scent it has. I will definitely be purchasing this product. Iu2019m hoping it may even help prolong the results of my forehead and eye smile injectableu2019s."

This is called a cream, but I'd describe it more as a gel-like/thin lotion texture. It spreads and absorbs really easily into my skin. It has just the slightest scent, isn't greasy feeling, and doesn't break me out! It surprisingly leaves my skin feeling instantly softer/smoother to the touch. I'm sure I'd need to use this for quite a while to see if it'll make a lasting noticeable difference with my fine lines, loss of firmness, and pores like it claims. But it's hard to stomach long term use with it being so pricey. It is a joy to use though."

This moisturizer boasts an advanced formulation that seamlessly melts into the skin, visibly reducing fine lines and imparting a delightful bouncy and supple feel.   My skin is a mix of combination and oily. After applying this cream, my skin felt hydrated and nourished.  With regular use, I noticed a significant reduction in fine lines. The cream not only addressed fine lines but also left my skin feeling more supple and firmer. It truly delivered on its promises.  I plan to continue incorporating this cream into my regular routine. The visible improvements in fine lines and the overall texture of my skin make it a staple. I would highly recommend it to friends seeking an effective solution for fine lines, firmness, and dryness.  In summary, Skinpower Advanced Cream lives up to its claims, providing a luxurious and effective solution for addressing fine lines and enhancing skin firmness. It has earned a permanent spot in my skincare regimen.  I received this product from Influenster in exchange of my honest opinion."

Many foundations and creams tend to appear greasier or encourage the oils in my skin when combined and I cannot stand how it looks. The scent is fantastic, I assume itu2019s the peony extract which are a lovely smell. The glowing natural skin is noticeable right away especially after a shower and immediately hydrating the skin with the cream. I have minimal fine lines but the areas appeared more plump and not as deep. I would love to switch over but the price tag is out of my reach for a 2 oz jar. Luxury brands are great but in this current economy thatu2019s a luxury I cannot enjoy so I am grateful for the sample that is nearly empty now. Lol.  In my photo you can see that the fine lines are not visible and I donu2019t have any wrinkles."
