My two favourite items are the Enzyme Cleanser and Face Cream. I have since repurchased full sizes in a few items and l am really enjoying these skincare products. For reference I am in my mid 40u2019s and have fair, sensitive skin. None of the products have caused any negative reactions. I definitely recommend giving this brand a chance and this mini kit is a great way to try without a major investment."

I've been using it for a few weeks now and it is making a huge difference in my skin. I love how my skin really absorbs everything without feeling greasy or that the product is sitting on top. It really goes nicely under my make up. I'm in my mid/late 30's and I think this will be my go to for awhile."

When I tried to open it,  only the plastic (cap piece) would come off, the dropper (rubber piece) was stuck to the glass bottle.  I tried several times but no luck.  I ended up having my bf looked at it because he works for a skincare company and familiar with packaging.  He had to slowly peel off the dropper and there's still a tiny little rubber piece glued to the glass bottle right now."

I have seen so many reviews of this happening to other people but I honestly thought Iu2019d be fine. Iu2019m very shocked. Obviously this is an ongoing problem with this product. Not sure why a skincare brand as prestigious and expensive as Dr. Barabara Sturm has not addressed and fixed this issue."

Very clean and simple. The enzyme cleanser is similar to the one Amore Pacific makes. Comes out a dusty powder and foams to scrub. My favorite part is the Hyaluronic serum though. I noticed an immediate lift and glow from using. Iu2019ve tried them all (skinceuticals dr Dennis gross Peter Thomas Roth etc.) this one has zero scent no color just simple and definitely lifting and pure. Two thumbs up."
