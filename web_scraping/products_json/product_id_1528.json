I will say the smell of the self tan is similar to sunscreen so if you are smell sensitive beware. Iu2019m a black woman who likes to self tan to keep my skin tone even. It was perfect for that! I"

For reference I am Filipino and have an orange-y tone to my skin, and this matches pretty well but if you are super pale or have more of a pink undertone, I can imagine it would look super unnatural! The smell isn't bad but it's not great. I usually leave it on overnight and it gets pretty dark and looks pretty glowy. Not very patchy if you apply it well! Layers pretty well too in my opinion."

Being someone who loves a sun-kissed glow but dislikes the fuss of traditional tanning methods, I was intrigued by the No-Transfer Tanning Mousse. And let me tell you, it's a game-changer!  The application couldn't be simpler. The tinted formula guides your hand seamlessly, ensuring a smooth, streak-free finish every time. I opted for the Medium Tan, and the result was a natural-looking radiance that lasted.  What really impressed me was the lightweight feel on my skin. It absorbed quickly, leaving behind no stickiness or residue. Plus, the absence of that dreaded self-tan smell was a major win.  Eight hours later, I was left with a beautifully even tan that didn't look the least bit artificial. And as it gradually faded, it did so evenly, leaving me with a seamless glow.  Overall, the No-Transfer Tanning Mousse has become my go-to for effortless bronzed skin. It's quick, easy, and delivers fantastic results every time. Trust me, your skin will thank you!"

Iu2019m almost 60 and have tried most every self-tanner, since the late 80u2019s. This one is by far the best, most realistic, and longest lasting self tanner Iu2019ve tried. You get super dark after about four hours, so be sure to wash it off earlier, if you donu2019t want to go that dark. read some comments about how green the mousse appears when itu2019s first dispensed, and theyu2019re right. This greenish hue though is what will keep you from turning orange. I exfoliate first and apply the mousse right after applying some very rich body lotion, so that the color doesnu2019tu2019grabu2019 in places like my knees and ankles. I also apply with the self- tanning mitts, one on each hand. I used to apply self-tanners with regular latex gloves, but the fuzzy texture of the mitts mbkends the mousse so much better into your skin, and helps the tanner go on evenly."

I apply it only once a week and I make sure to avoid any exfoliation when I have it on, to increase my tans life. If I need to shave I do so very lightly, with minimal pressure from the razor. Using the mitt and good lighting, it's not hard to accomplish a streak free tan :) Make sure to exfoliate/remove your old tan before applying a new one!!"

Just follow the normal self tan recommendations by exfoliating the day before not shaving the day of application and lightly moisturizing hands feet elbows and knees. Also donu2019t worry about leaving it on more than three hours, I have left it on overnight when I want a super dark glow. I usually use this one on u201cfreshu201d skin after the previous tan is removed and will use the gradual tanner or the regular mousse to maintain.

Looks quite light upon application because this product doesn't dazzle you with the color guard that washes off in the first shower after application. Cheaper mousse will do that... Not this one. It has 100% DHAs meaning it's potent in the developing process. - it lasts a week if not longer if you care for your self tan (moisturize daily) - the fading period is quite graceful  This mousse isn't for you if: - you don't enjoy being a tad sticky after applying. The stickiness goes away after a bit but it is a little sticky, not excessive though. - cool tone people may not enjoy the this product as it could make them look a little orange. It's good for neutral and warm skin tones as I feel this tanner leans a bit on the warm tone."

I just exfoliate the day before and make sure Iu2019m completely dry when I apply. I donu2019t necessarily apply right after the shower either - sometimes in the middle of the day, as long as I exfoliated before. The color develops really nicely and looks like I got a professional spray tan."

I never noticed a self tan smell but that could be because I only did test strips. I used a small kabuki to apply the test strips.  I included pictures of first the initial application, and then afterwards. The results are two pictures because one is right after I washed off the 3 hour strip and the second is 12 hours after wash off. I tried to label the pictures so I hope it makes sense. You can definitely notice a color after you wash it off even after the first hour but it got much darker the next day (I did this in the evening). I knocked off half a star because the difference between the 1, 2, and 3 hour test strips are minimal. This could be due to dispersement of product and it being on the palest part of my arm. The difference between 1 and 2 is almost non existent and 3 is only slightly darker. However Iu2019m pretty impressed with how dark the color turned out since it wasnu2019t on that long at all. Having that kind of color after only an hour is pretty impressive. However I still have yet to use this on my entire body and I will update if needed.  Overall Iu2019m pretty happy with it. The Ashley Graham collaboration is still my favorite in terms of color but this one is a close second because I hate having to leave self tanners on for hours because itu2019s just uncomfortable for me. If they made the Ashley Graham one an express I could die happy lol!"

I donu2019t get out in the sun most days and as a consequence am pretty pale, so I let the product sit on my skin for about 1.5 hours for a nice, natural look. In the summer, or when itu2019s otherwise believable that I might actually have a tan, I keep it on for up to two hours, but my skin would definitely start to look unnatural if I left it on any longer than that. I bounce back and forth between St. Tropez and Loving Tan, and this one is definitely easier and faster to apply. I do think that Loving Tan, with its redder undertones, may be a more natural look, but this one makes me feel more like a golden goddess, and I just keep it a little lighter to prevent any potential over-bronzing. The St. Tropez color also fades really nicely; with good maintenance, the color does last for about a week, and it fades without any streaks or splotchiness. The biggest downside to the St. Tropez mousse is that it gives my skin a faint-to-noticeable burning smell until I shower with soap. Because of this, I try to plan my schedule so that I can apply the tanner the day before an event, let the color develop overnight post-rinse, and then fully shower the next day."

Do not recommend using on the face either unless you have perfect skin, as it clings to imperfections making a dark spot unlike any tanner I have used before.

I knew that with citywide  closures, come summer I'd have to learn to do it myself.   Well, I should have been using this all along. I cannot recommend it enough. Zero streaks when applied thoroughly with the mitt, great color, easily buildable, seamless to touch up a mistake, dries quickly, and mess free. Sure, it has a faint self-tanner smell -- they all do because of the DHA.

I was left with no lines/creases (I was worried I would  as it was my first time) and a very mild glow over my body. I put on a extra layer on my tan lines and they are no longer there! As for my face, a lesson learned is to blend into your hairline!! I am fairly pale and now I look like I have the wrong shade foundation applied by a kid... my own fault but will definitely know for next time! I took away one star because it did apply more orange than I expected, but Iu2019m still very impressed with the application! I would still recommend this product for people looking for a quick and effortless self tanner!"

I use the St. Tropez mitt with the product and it goes on flawlessly. I leave it on for 2-3 hours and rinse it off. I find the tan continues to develop overnight after rinsing, and I am left with a pretty (non-orange) glow. I am very pale so self-tanners scare me, but this one is very natural. I have had friends ask how I got such a nice sun kissed glow and they are surprised when I say it's fake! I will say it is not the darkest tan, which may bother some people, but I feel it is the most natural looking self tanner I have ever used. I also have found if I apply it two nights in a row I am a left with a deeper tan."

For one, this product does not smell terrible as most self tanners do. It has a light scent that dissipates/is no longer that noticeable after the guide colour is showered off. This product is a little tacky after it dries but itu2019s not the end of the world as I only have to deal with it for 3 hrs. If you read the bottle, it says itu2019s not recommended for use past 3 hrs. DO NOT SLEEP IN THIS TANNER IT WILL STAIN your BED SHEETS! Wear clothes you donu2019t care about while you wait for 1-3 hrs. Every time I use this I wear for 3 hrs and shower off and in the morning I am left with this gorgeous natural deep tan. 10/10!"

I typically will exfoliate a day before and then apply the self tanner the next day. Iu2019ll wear it for three hours and then rinse off and shower normally. The tan is so natural and lasts for so long. With other tanners, I will have to reapply almost everyday or as often as possible because they become patchy.

Does not stain. It lasts a good few days. That said, I was pretty disappointed with this product. I'm ghostly pale so I didn't expect to get super dark, but after 3+ hours I was only slightly tanned. I have gotten darker with their classic tan. The thing I really dislike is that you don't actually get a deeper colour as time goes on, rather you become bronzier and more yellow-ish. It's not orange or anything, but it definitely isn't the nice brown tone advertised, either. This isn't an actual express tan; the colour still takes 8 hours to develop, even if you can wash it off in 3. Also, I found that the smell lingered the entire time I wore the tan -- perfume and body lotion covered it, but it was there until I scrubbed it off (but this is true of every tan I've tried)."

For those who say they have very light tans, I would say most likely didnu2019t exfoliate or leave it on for long enough. 1 hour will give you a very light glow, 3+ hours will give you the darkest tan you can get. The only thing is, it is really sticky and does feel like it doesnu2019t dry down completely, it doesnu2019t bother me though which is why I continue to use it. Iu2019m probably going to try the classic tanner next, however I do like this one because I could hypothetically wash it off after 3 hours and get the same tan as I would if I left it on for 8 hours."

Iu2019ve messed it up and ended splotchy because I was lazy, so in case you are afraid I will tell you how to apply: exfoliate & shave minimum 12 hours before application. Do not moisturize in between exfoliating and applying, donu2019t apply deodorant, or anything else on your skin. When ready to apply, slather a moisturizer HEAVILY on feet/ankles (the easiest place to mess up), and lightly on knees, elbows, and other dry places with thin skin. Then apply the mousse using the mitt and buff until you think youu2019re done, then 1 minute longer. Try to stay in A/C, do not sweat or be active for at least 2 hours before a cold shower. I recommend using a makeup wipe for excess product along hairline, nose, and neck if using for face, but not on dry areas as you will have white spots.  My best tip is to shower in only cold water when wearing the product. Your tan will last so much longer! Moisturize a ton between applications and completely remove/exfoliate the tan before the next app.  The best tanner if you follow the guidelines! :)"

Then, those options tended to fade quickly and Iu2019d feel like I needed to use more every other day to maintain the colour I wanted. This is different! This I can use once every 5 days if not a week (depending on if you use moisturizer after showering for longevity). I leave it on for three hours and wash it off, and after a few more hours, Iu2019m quite dark! However, I deducted one star as the buyer should beware that it is quite tacky feeling for those 3 hours. I make a point to use it when I know I donu2019t have to go anywhere for at least 3 hours, and I wear long pants to avoid the colour guard from getting on things such as my couch as it will rub off onto other fabrics! If you can handle feeling a little sticky for three hours, itu2019s worth it. I wasnu2019t able to continue using their other products as I hated the tacky feeling for 8 hours and the result wasnu2019t nearly worth it. But for 3 hours with the express, and being able to shower it off right after while it continues to darken, itu2019s a fair trade off in my opinion!"

The instructions were very clear so anyone who left a bad review just doesnu2019t know how to use this product properly. I went from using the shade Ceylan in my Nars foundation to using Stromboli if you're wondering how much darker I got.  How to use it properly:  Make sure you exfoliate, shave & moisturize your skin 3-24 hrs prior to using it. Use a tanning mitt for best results. Start by applying on areas with thicker skin and use the excess to apply on areas like wrists, knees, and elbows where the skin is thinner. Let it dry before wearing clothes again and leave it on for 1-3 hours depending on how dark you want to get. I left it on for 2.5 hours and then washed it off with just some warm water without scrubbing too hard. The tan will instantly wash off but will reappear within hours as it sets into your skin. It takes up to 8 hours after washing for you to see the final product.   This was my first time using a self-tanner and I only got some patchy spots on my stomach because I forgot to exfoliate it. My tan was flawless besides that. Will be buying again and recommending to everyone."

Always, always shower, shave, and then diligently exfoliate prior to application with a tanning mitt. You can pick up cheap exfoliating gloves from Walmart. Scour the heck out of everywhere including feet, ankles and wrists. Be sure your body is completely dry. Apply a good thick moisturizer to your hands and feet (possibly elbows and knees depending on your skin) and proceed to apply 2 or 3 pumps to independent sections of your body avoiding the wrists and ankles. Go in with an old makeup brush with 1/4 of a pump on ankles, feet, wrists and hands. I personally use the leftover stuff on the mitt after carefully buffing out my body to gently go over my face.   I left this on for 4 hours (stayed nekkid for the first hour) then rinsed and generally applied moisturizer everywhere. The next day tan was fully developed and was perfect.   The most even and nicely coloured self-tanning product Iu2019ve ever got my hands on. Highly recommend and well worth the $$."

Also, I always apply it with a mitt and make note of washing my hands 2 hours after applying so my hands are not too dark (otherwise, they will look super weird, like gloves).

I can get the perfect tan that lasts weeks (fades beautifully) and best of all my extremely sensitive skin (dry, itchy, rashy my entire life) never negatively reacts to this self tanner - 10/10 recommend to everyone. The bottle last me approximately 6 months or at least a minimum of 5 applications. Each application lasts me approximately 3 weeks or a minimum of 10 days.   This tan does not come out orange - I am very fair skinned... dare I say, paler than the moon.   TIP: letting your tan fade all the way down and exfoliating will give a better result than tanning again before the prior tan has fully faded/been removed - layering this self tanner will result in patchy fading which is NOT cute  TIP: you can use this to contour your face and body so when you're natural you still looked SNATCHED - be your own tan artist"

The final color is gorgeous & could only be achieved by at least 2-3 applications of the original mousse; it really is a fantastic product... if used correctly. haha So minus 1 star only for it's inability to be user friendly.   I love St. Tropez products; I've been using them for over 7 years when I first got a set in THE best 500 pt. perk box. The original mousse spoils you! There is SO much room for error with it that it's easy to get lazier with each passing application, especially if you have all the products in the line.   With my first application of this particular mousse, I did my usual thing: light exfoliation with my gloves in the shower, casually used whatever body lotion was within reach, applied in a circular motion with my mitt, & looked over my worked in a large mirror with sun light. At first it looked fantastic, another job well done... until it developed...  I spent entirely too much time with baking soda, my exfoliant, a tanning brush, a dry brush, & a mirror after that folks. Do not be me... be the girl you were that first time you stood in the mirror all those years ago AFTER the actual first time you self-tanned, armed with internet knowledge & the moxy to have the PERFECT self-tan! That girl is inside all of us & SHE is needed for this product, not the lazy house cat version of yourself that grew accustom to a whatever routine."

I have now switched over to the express tan because I like it the most!   Pros:  * The formula really allows you to personalize your shade of tan. I generally leave the formula on for 3 hours (and sometimes sleep in it) to get the darkest shade possible. I then reapply it the following day to get my perfect shade.  * The tan lasts a long time as long as you continue to moisturize daily. I get at least 8 days of wear time with this tanner!   * The color is definitely not orange. Iu2019m very pale, so Iu2019m always concerned about coming off orange when using fake tanner. This tanner leaves a nice deep tan, I look so beachy and glowy!  Cons: * The smell of this tanner is by far the worst out of the St. Tropez line. Not only does it smell bad, but it lingers for DAYS. I find that I smell like tanner for about 3 days, and it gets worse when sweating. Itu2019s really not cute. If youu2019re going on a date or to an important event where you donu2019t want to smell like cat pee, Iu2019d seriously recommend applying this a few days beforehand so that the smell goes away!   Overall I really like this tanner and will continue to use it. However, if you truly hate the smell of tanner, this guy might not be for you."

Make sure to do your nails after too! White toe nail polish anyone?   I like to do it once a week (the night before I wash my sheets), sleep in it, and rinse in the morning."

I left the tanner on for 2 hours before I rinsed it off. When you rinse it off you will not notice a difference but wait 8 hours and you will see a beautiful, even, golden tan. I was very happy with the result and it was easy to apply because of the color guard. The tan is very natural looking on my very fair skin. I received many compliments from my friends and everyone was surprised that it came from this. I love using this for special occasions but there are some downsides: Downside #1: Very sticky while waiting. Downside #2: Doesn't last very long - maybe 3 days. Overall, this product is great I just wish it lasted longer."

I never used a foam before or attempted a more dramatic change in skin tone so I watched a hundred YT videos before using this as I was nervous. I bought a kit with a body mit, face mit and back mit (to help reach your back) on Amazon and bought the mousse in store. I left mine on for two hours and could easily have done another hour without looking freakish as the color was beautiful and olive tones and golden not orange at all! So good for fair skinned, however if you are darker skinned I'd rec the dark mousse as this was almost the full time and on a darker skin tone wouldn't turn up much a difference. All in all I'll keep using it and people have asked me what I used and have rec to many people since then that are fair skinned. Watch some videos if you're new to a mousse and you'll get it down and save money! One spray tan is 40$ and for a whole bottle 42$ you can get 7 full body applications or more! Also I found the color and evenness much better since I'm applying it myself I did a good job not missing spots on my hands and wrists that were otherwise missed or spotty with spray tans. I also used a fat kabuki type makeup brush to apply to my face and since I wash my face 2 a day I used their purity facial mist every other night to keep my glow growing longer on my neck and face as it fades fast from washing there. But the rest of my body easily lasts 10 days with one 2 hours application, patting dry after showers and moisturizing! Only con is the color guard to see where you've applied it is very light even on my super fair skin and so you just have to go with where you felt it wet already for knowing where the application was so I deduced a star"

It didnu2019t go on as smooth as the other mousse, but it still had a good guide color so I applied it all over and waited 2.5 hours before washing off.  (Tip: put your mit over a hairbrush to help reach your back) Six hours later there wasnu2019t much tan showing up, so I went to bed and the next morning I had a light tan but not as much color as I was used to so it was disappointing.

This is a great product for someone like me who is new to self tanning, I was getting tired of using gradual moisturizers from the drugstore, by the time I got some color it would start to flake and fade so I wanted something that would last at least a week and this is it! Iu2019m very pale so I feel like I need just a little color but I want it to look natural, not super dark, the first time I tried it I did it for an hour, it was very subtle, no one around me even noticed I had used tanner. The 2nd time I did two hours and I got just a little more color, this last time I kept it on for 2.5 hours and it wasnu2019t super dark, so I donu2019t think doing it for 3 hours would look crazy dark like I originally had thought it might do. So itu2019s very subtle, even if you use it the full three hours, you arenu2019t going to end up really dark, just a few shades darker than your natural color. It also didnu2019t feel super sticky or really have much of a smell to me which was a relief, I hate that sticky feeling you can get from tanners and nobody likes that self tanner smell. It also lasted about 8 days before I felt like it started to fade, I will continue to buy for sure, I love the subtle, non orange color it gives me and the shorter u2018marinatingu2019 time before you can shower it off. Be sure to exfoliate well and use a mitt, that will keep your fingers from turning orange/brown and help get the color even."

The only good thing about it is the ability to get hard to reach places, like your back. But I would not recommend this at all"

After a few hours I did notice a self tanning smell, but it wasnu2019t to bad.  Next morning I saw much better results, my skin developed a nice tan which is very different from what I saw the night before, which was almost no colour.  I overdid it in the underarm area as well as top of my hands which next time I will go very light on.. I did notice some areas were darker and I remember that I may have gone over them twice when applying, so make sure you only go over the area once.  Overall a nice colour! I would just be more careful when applying next time."

I used Vita Liberata gradual lotion before and the colour of the Vita Liberata was worse, more orange. Your skin does feel sticky after using. The smell was quite pleasant, I would describe it like a shampoo smell. I only noticed a faint DHA smell. I will probably try the classic mousse next."

It's a great alternative to tanning beds (obviously) and you can usually get about 8 tans out of the bottle depending on how much you use. Considering an airbrush is about 50-60 USD not including tip, this will definitely save you a couple hundred dollars while still providing a comparable look in terms of color and tone.   This product is brown base as well, so you do not orange. I have olive-tan skin on the darker side so I tend to leave it on for 2.5-3 hours; if you have fairer skin I would recommend leaving it on for 1-1.5 hours to avoid any dramatic lines or abnormal looks.   This product has a bronzer in it to help you know hwere you have put it on, that is what will wash off in the shower. However, once you put it on you should plan to be inside for the duration of the tan, because it will look a bit wild until you wash off the excess. Your skin will then continue to pigment over the next few hours.   I use this all over my body, including my face despite St Tropez not necessarily recommending it for use on face. I have sensitive skin and have not had any issues with breakouts on my face as a result.   This product also does a great job of evening skin tone and giving a super natural look which allows you to go without makeup for almost a week. This is great if you have any sort of hyper pigmentation that you consistently try to hide."

My go to is 1-2 hours, honestly I usually leave it on for an hour an a half, give it a quick rinse, then leave it on for the rest of the 8 hours. By the end of the 8 hours I have a very gorgeous glow. Leaving it on for the different amounts of time does actually make a difference unlike some other brands. I love that there are options and that it still develops even after the first quick rinse! This is the best! It does give you a little bronze at first so you will see it for the first couple hours then you rinse it off QUICKLY donu2019t rinse forever, just enough to get a little off like seriously about 1-2 minutes then get out of the shower! Then go on and allow it to develop!  Quick tip: you can go on about your day for 8 hours but the tan does still develop so if you are wearing makeup it will not match at the end of the day so I recommend doing it at night then after you rinse go to bed to let it develop all night."

For reference, Iu2019m naturally very fair (Nars Mont Blanc), and this brings me to a deep medium (Nars Barcelona, which I then bronze even further with Laguna. Lol). Very happy to have found a self tanner that I donu2019t have to wallow in uncomfortably for eight hours. I apply in the evening with a mitt to clean shaven, exfoliated skin as directed. I leave on for three hours, or a little more if I forget, and then shower (directions say to do so without soap). You donu2019t see a result after the shower, and the guide color does very visibly wash down the drain, so I was skeptical at first. However, I wake up to a deep, natural looking tan, which for me is pretty amazing. Thrilled to have found something that works, without having to fry myself at a tanning bed or take time out of my day to spray tan. Highly recommend if youu2019re like me and hate sleeping in tanner, and have a little patience with the development of the tan."

I applied some plain lotion to my feet, ankles and knees, let it sit about twenty minutes, then spent maybe ten minutes very carefully applying the mousse in smallish amounts, making sure to really work it into the skin and to smooth out any places that looked streaky.  Then I sat on my couch (on a towel) for about an hour and a half before rinsing it off.  You can leave it on up to three hours, but I was just looking to take the edge off as opposed to getting a full tan.  The next morning I woke up and was VERY happy with how it turned out.  It's a very natural, even color.  I only had one or two small places where it looked a little too dark or patchy and they were easy to smooth out with a little toner on a cotton pad.  I remember how awful self tan products were in the 90s, and cannot believe how much easier they are to use now.  I plan on using this all summer."

One tip with this product, exfoliate and moisturize natural dry spots (elbows, ankles, hands, wrists) before applying and if use a baby wipe or make up wipe to clean off nails and palms of hands after applying."

I leave on for 2-3 hours, And the results are always great.  I put this on my face as well. However, I uslually do my face last and just use whatever product is left on the mitt (same for my hands/feet).  The only negative is the St Tropez Mitts that I buy to use with it. The mitts do kinda fall apart after 2 uses. It may be the way I am straining to reach my mid back area. But they get little holes that turn into huge holes pretty quickly.  I just use them anyway and work awkwardly around it.   The actual tanning foam Product itself is awesome!  Using a loofah everyday in the shower usually keeps my skin exfoliated enough for when I apply the foam.  So although it recommends exfoliating prior to use.... if you are like me and use a loofah and put a little moisturizer on your knees, elbows, hands, feet, and sometimes my neck.  You should be good to go without a hardcore exfoliating process first."

And because of my light complexion, any sort of beach vacation becomes a struggle of will.  Tan and suffer or stay pale and envious of everyone else's tan. Enter self tanners...I tried them all including professional airbrushing which was my go-to before I discovered this product. My biggest challenge was that, I think because of that skin condition, none of them could get me to that deeper a week in the tropics level. Even airbrushing, no matter how deep of a color I selected, after the first shower I was left with just a bronzed glow. But not this guy.   Now, I actually don't follow the instructions and keep it on overnight. I would not recommend that if you have a skin that tans normally. But if you struggle with getting a deeper tan, that will do it.  This leaves me with a beautiful naturally looking deep color. However my husband (who also became a fan) can achieve the same result by leaving it on for only 2-3 hours.  So this might take a little testing before you find your right level/timing.  Other positives are that it goes on pretty evenly and doesn't have excessive self tanner smell, although there is some but it usually dissipates within a day. It also doesn't dry out my skin as much as some of the other tanners do.  Few pointers, this product sets fast so I would suggest applying it onto one section and working it in before moving onto the next one. Also, I'd skip the application mitt. Honestly it feels like you're wasting a ton of product that gets soaked up into it and by the time you are 3/4 of the way done it's soaked through and staining your hand.  I just lotion my hands with a thick lotion or coconut oil, leave on for few minutes then rinse with warm water, dry and start applying. It works great and I never had a problem with my hands being stained.  To sum up, if you're tan challenged like me, you need to try this!"

Exfoliating before and moisturizing dry areas (elbows, knees, ankles) helps immensely.  Even though this is the express version- I still leave it on for 3-4 hours, as I prefer a darker tan.  It also helps to know that you MUST not sweat/get wet while the product is doing it's thing- you will end up blotchy. I typically have this issue on my chest so I make sure I am hanging around the house for a few hours while the product sets in.  Once you shower it off, you're good to glow. (Pun intended) I typically use this once a week to keep it maintained.  10/10 would recommend."

Every single self tanner I have ever tried has made me look  orange or super olive, and for someone who is pink-undertoned, olive doesn't look natural. I don't know how this stuff does it, but it tans me while keeping my pink undertones to give me a natural tan! It's wonderful. I'll never try anything else. No streaking, easy to apply (seriously if I can use it, you can use it), and the smell isn't horrible (the tanner smell is definitely there, but if you apply it before bed it fades by the time you wake up). Will repurchase for the summer months!!!"

I'm naturally fair to light with yellow underlines and self tanner always makes my skin look yellower than it is. Im writing this review because the other day I accidentally fell asleep with this on for 6 hours. When I woke up I was insanely panicked and ran to the bathroom immediately to rinse it off. To my surprise, the developed product was not orangey at all but a beautiful, medium dark tan. It's much much darker than what I would usually go for and I would probably never try that again, but it's good to know that no matter how much you overdo it with this product, it'll always look natural. I love this and I highly recommend it for self tanning newbies and veterans alike!"

I workout every single day, and with spray tans from the tanning salon, they would RUB OFF where my sports bra rubbed against my skin, so I would remove my clothes and see the outline of my bra! The outline would be pale and the rest of me would be some sort of orangey-tan.. THIS STUFF is a game changer. I leave it on for three hours, rinse it off and NEVER have to worry about it rubbing off being, being blotchy, and it fades nicely and evenly. PLEASE do not pass this up! I recommend this to everyone. I use it on my face also, so I don't have to throw make up on, and it has never made my sensitive skin break out! It does wear off on the face a LITTLE bit quicker, but thats because I rub my face with cleansers and masks everyday lol. AND you can exfoliate your skin with this on and the tan doesn't come off! You will fall in love with this! Just purchased my second bottle!"

Four hours (or even two) is still a long time to let myself sit and not really go out anywhere or get my hands wet or sweat. I tried sleeping in it but it comes off on my sheets. 2.

It has a tint which WILL transfer and takes a little time to dry, but it does develop faster than any other self tanner I've used and as with all St. Tropez products, the color is natural and beautiful. I didn't even have a mitt with me to use but I didn't have any problems with streakiness.

I was horrified, thinking I had once again wasted money on St Tropez (in shower lotion didn't work AT ALL). It got darker and after about 2.5 hours (just like reviewers said they did with no result!), rinsed off in the shower. Color was completely gone, so I thought for sure it was a complete waste. However, in about two hours, I noticed it was starting to darken. By bedtime, it was very dark. In the morning, super dark, but blotchy on my face. Took a shower and everything evened out. Looks fantastic! I was pleasantly surprised this is the end result after reading the reviews. I hadn't showered at all the day I put it on, I used my old mitt (had it for at least three years from St Tropez) put a pretty good slathering of lotion on my feet, ankles, knees, elbows, hands...and it turned out great. I would use this again before the mousse since this can be washed off way sooner and you don't feel as sticky for as long. Not sure if not showering was the key, but hey, it worked!"

I liked the idea of not needing to wait overnight and that feature has come in handy in the few times I've used it since I've bought it. I love not going to sleep stinking of fake tan. The color guard isn't as dark as I'm used to so application is a little trickier. I wound up with a bit more patchiness/blotchiness than I typically do and I do think it leaned a touch more orange than the dark does. It still wasn't ORANGE orange, but not the true olivey-bronze I'm used to. I liked that I could touch up the patches and missed spots in an hour though, and it all wound up blending pretty seamlessly. Overall I'll stick to the dark mousse in the future but I'm not going to return this."

One really important thing I ignored first time I used it, use a mitt with this!!!! My hands were stained green after using it! I recommend a tanning mitt, or even just using gloves to avoid getting it on your palms! I use the Vita Liberata Tanning Mitt, it is very inexpensive, but works wonderfully!"

It is so easy to apply, the smell is pleasant, non sticky formula and leaves such a natural beautiful tan that is unbelievable! I get so many complements on my tan and even when it fades it is so natural! All around a wonderful product! I'll never use anything else!"

I would definitely purchase the cheap mitt because that's what ensures a smooth application and no streaking compared to other tanners. I am very pale....like, 115 MUFE foundation is a little too dark for me.....and after the first application I had a nice glow. I waited one day and decided to add another layer without exfoliating and achieved a much better and darker color. It dries within 2 minutes to where I could put on clothes and wore it throughout the day because it didn't look bad and just had a slight smell. Once it's rinsed off it doesn't smell. I wore both applications 8 to 10 hours and slept in one application with no issues. What was so surprising was how long it lasted. I thought it had worn off until I got my legs waxed 2 weeks later and realized I had forgotten my own paleness! It faded very naturally but i am going to try the Dark Bronzing Mousse next to see if I can get a darker color in less time."

It lasted for a week, but I hated having to wait so long, so I tried this product. I applied it with the mitt and I left it on for 2 1/2 hours. Before the application, I exfoliated, moisturized and all that jazz. I noticed the application wasn't as smooth as with the original formula, but I thought maybe this is how it works. After I showered, I didn't see much of a difference, but the bottle does say it continues working for 8 hours after washing it off. So my next shower, the color just came off. Not evenly either. A good amount came off my legs and my chest. I'm not sure what happened, but I will definitely stick to the original mousse."
