Essentially the smell starts to spread the moment you light it. It is a very warm and comforting scent. It is the perfect autumnal or winter candle in my opinion. The vanilla is not a sickly sweet vanilla but a really warm and mature vanilla, the star of the show is the sandalwood. Sandalwood has a reputation for being a rather masculine note but in this candle it really becomes soft and perfect as a home scent. Also the vessel for the candle is so gorgeous honestly such a beautiful piece of decor, lit or not. Yes it is pricey and I'm not sure anything can justify charging 45$ for a candle but if you are buying this as a gift or as a special treat then yes it is worth it."

It's warm, comforting & sweet but not cloying or overpowering. When I burn this candle in my apartment it's like wrapping myself in a cozy blanket on a cool fall day after pulling a fresh tray of sugar cookies out of the oven. The strong vanilla fragrance is amazing and I love the subtle spicy and woody undertones. Plus the gorgeous jar... I mean it would personally be difficult for me to give one of these candles away but I don't know anyone who wouldn't be thrilled to receive one as a gift. The best!!!"

Baltic Amber is one of those classic Voluspa scents. It's warm, but neutral in the sense that it anybody would love it. It's not overly floral, or overly earthy, or overly fruity. It's an ambient scent that can be used year round, but it's my go to fall scent in my apartment. Plus, the big jar burn time is SO long. Literally could burn it all day, days on end and it would take forever to burn out. I always have a back up on hand.

The candle was burning in small room and I was sitting right beside it and didn't smell a thing. For the price of these candles, the fragrance should fill the room. I've had much better performance for BBW candles. I immediately contact CS and was told sorry, no refunds, even though the candle is poor quality and burned ONCE. That is $30 down the drain. I will NEVER buy from the company again!! At least Bath and Body Works stands behind their products and allows returns if you are not satisfied.  I will make sure everyone knows how overpriced and low quality these candles are. My first and LAST time buying."
