            "review_text": "Itu2019s hard for me to not write reviews as a physician so bear with me. Hexapeptide 8 is the new u201citu201d ingredient thatu2019s found in many plumping products these days. Itu2019s known by a few names. Itu2019s the closest topical ingredient to Botox so itu2019s in a lot of things from Paulau2019s Choice (Rescue and repair intensive moisturizer) to The Ordinaryu2019s Argireline 10% solution. Same ingredient, different names. Do they work? Yes, for most people. It doesnu2019t last long though and if itu2019s not formulated properly it can leave a waxy residue. This product is decent. It would be better as a moisturizer but people love u201ctargeted treatmentsu201d because it tricks the brain into spending more money if the u2018magicu2019 ingredient seems to be in stronger percentages. Is it going to do anything for wrinkles longterm? No. HA and squalane simply hydrate the skin so wrinkles appear more plump. Only things that actually fix wrinkles are Botox, fillers, laser treatments, retinoids and vitamin C. The rest just make them less noticeable and most companies do admit that as you can see when they say, u201creduces the appearance of wrinkles.u201d This isnu2019t going to do anything longterm so donu2019t expect that. At most, it plumps lines for a few hours and hydrates. If you want to skip Botox, etc, use a retinoid 4x a week, increase your moisture and choose one with peptides (Peter Thomas Roth has one called skinjection that has this ingredient and more for a full plumping effect). I love Muradu2019s retinol and retinal. Throw in a vitamin C and broad spectrum sunscreen and youu2019ll see permanent changes. This product is a u201cfake it til you make itu201d product so if it works for you and makes you happy, thatu2019s what matters. :)"

I have been using this a few weeks now and have noticed a decrease in the appearance of my wrinkles. I am excited to see more improvement with continued use."

The applicator makes the cream so easy to apply - and the cream itself is very hydrating and creates an instant smoothing effect. With ingredients like peptides, hyaluronic acid, and squalane, itu2019s perfect for all skin types as it is gentle and moisturizing. It provides plumpness to the skin when applied and gradually improves fine lines and wrinkles over time. I really like it!"

I just use a little at a time especially itu2019s kinda expensive but a tiny amount goes a long way. It helps to moisture under the eyes and reduce wrinkles . This squeeze tube arrived safely and undamaged and also hit a home run with the design as Iu2019m a sucker of a lovely packaging. The cooling applicator tip is built right into the cap, once the light cream/serum was dispensed, you can directly apply onto your face without mess and stickiness. I highly recommend it especially for dry skin."

It does not contain parabens, sulfates, phthalates, gluten, mineral oil, formaldehyde, petrolatum, oxybenzone or animal derived ingredients. I like that it is fragrance free.

And it actually works! I used it on the lines on my forehead which are quite deep, and it made them markedly better. I also used it on the lines under my eyes and around my mouth and it really helped plump those areas so my face looked brighter and younger and helped it looked great under make up. I even had my older sister try it and she saw results too, so I know I wasnu2019t imagining it!

I am 35 years old, and I recently complained about the fine lines around my eyes. I could tell they were getting deeper and more noticeable. It has been 7 days using the corrector day and night, and I have already seen results. My eye area is smoother, and the fine lines are less visible. Even makeup looks better around my eyes than a few days ago. I hope you can see the difference in the pictures. Also, the applicator is fantastic, very cooling, and relaxing to use. It is a great product, I highly recommend it."

I don't have major wrinkles but am all about using products to avoid a future problem before it exists and then try to rewind the effects.   No scent and will last a while with how little you need to use. Because irs a thicker texture, it may take a bit for the product to full absorb into the skin. It can leave a bit of product behind if you do not fully absorb and you use too much but it will eventually sink all into the skin or you can keep massaging the product with your fingers if the applicator doesn't work for you.

The first thing I noticed is the small metal smoothing tip. It was perfect for massaging and smoothing the product over my skin. However I think it would be even more amazing if that piece was removable so that I could cool it before using. After a few days of using I was surprised to see that some of my fine lines looked smoother almost like a primers blurred effect. This is amazing and I will keep using it."

This helps firm, brighten, hydrate and smooth fine lines and I noticed my skin feels brighter. The texture of the wrinkle corrector  is a light cream. I use it in the morning and evening, under my moisturizer. I pat it onto my skin around the entire eye area, in a gentle circular motion with my ring finger. I also place it on my smile lines and forehead, Its overall formula is so gentle and absorbs seamlessly into my skin. My fine lines have started to slowly fade. My dark circles have really started to fade making my eyes look brighter. I wait one minute so it fully absorbs. My makeup goes on flawlessly without any pilling because my eye and forehead are smooth. A little product goes a long way, and the cooling top applicator helps easily apply. I love the way it locks on when closing. Ultimately, this has given me a brighter, healthier looking glow under my eyes and anywhere I notice my fine lines. I am enthusiastic about continuing to use this to see ongoing results!"

Just to be sure though, I tested it on my 59 year old mom (after disinfecting the tip). Her forehead lines were also quite smoothed! Her smile lines and where her eyes crinkle when she smiles were harder to see a big difference but with our first few uses, they did seem to fade a bit. She also liked the metal applicator to message the product in before using fingers.  Overall, I think this product is pretty decent but the price is a bit high.

I have used retinols religiously for over half a decade now, so my skin is already in a place I am generally happy with.
