If you haven't detoxed to an aluminum-free deodroant, be sure to do so before writing this deodorant off, because this is the best!

Been using natural deodorant for well over five years. This makes me feel like Im back to purgin. Its definitely formulated for sensitive skin as Ive had zero issues or discomfort but definitely requires reapplication after about 10 hours of a normal day. Havent even tried to wear to a workout because I dont see it lasting through it."

By the end of the day there is a body order, but for an all natural deodorant thats to be expected.  My issue is the packaging. After my first purchase the bottle started to leak what I would assume is scent fluid? Its thick and sticky and gets all over. I emailed Salt & Stone, they said it was a defective batch and very graciously sent me a second bottle. That second bottle also leaks. I will not be purchasing again as it is too much of a mess"

Overall, a reliable option for everyday use, earning four stars in my book"
