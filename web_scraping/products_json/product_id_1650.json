Its small enough to toss in a purse or makeup bag but the tweezers are large enough to work perfectly without feeling like they are too small. Some minis are too small to be functional but these are not. The little case is gorgeous and functional. It barely takes up any space. This makes a great addition to my Tweezerman collection!"
