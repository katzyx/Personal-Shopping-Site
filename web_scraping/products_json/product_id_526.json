            "review_text": "I\u2019m really picky about dessert or gourmand scents but I still enjoy wearing this. That\u2019s probably because this has a little more going on than just sugar and sweetness. Like other reviewers say it definitely smells like a lemon cupcake, but the citrus and floral notes help to balance it out. That being said it\u2019s still very much a dessert scent so if that\u2019s not your thing, then this probably isn\u2019t for you. Besides the scent profile the best part about this fragrance is the lasting power\u2014I can still smell it in my hair three days later, which is why I came on here to write a review. I\u2019ve also tried You Remind Me and this one is my favorite of the two."

It\u2019s smelled as everything rich and warm and elegant. II could still smell it hours later even after a shower. She did her big one with this one."

It's the kind of scent that makes you feel confident and beautiful."

The packaging is so elegant and versatile and the color of the perfume itself is light so it doesn\u2019t stain or tint anything. It also sprays really well and does not come out in thick lines or drops. It is a little more floral on me than it is on a tester card which I didn\u2019t love quite as much but I have noticed it smells beautiful on other people so I think that just may be my body chemistry. The only real issue I have is how long it lasts. It lasts about 2-3 hours on me which isn\u2019t terrible but for being a higher end perfume, I would hope it would last a bit longer. For the price though I don\u2019t mind reapplying throughout the day so overall this is a great pick."

A well-crafted fragrance can transport you to different places and times, making it a powerful accessory in anyone's collection.At the heart of every perfume lies its composition, which typically includes top, middle, and base notes. The top notes are what you smell immediately upon application; they are usually fresh and vibrant, such as citrus or herbal scents. As the fragrance settles, the middle notes emerge, often floral or fruity, providing the character of the perfume. Finally, the base notes, which include deeper, richer elements like woods or musks, create a lasting impression.The versatility of perfumes is another remarkable aspect. Whether you're looking for something light and refreshing for daytime wear or a deep, sensual scent for evening occasions, there's a fragrance to suit every mood and moment."

It\u2019s soft feminine flirty fun and delicious. I love the opening of candied lemon and jasmine and it dries down to a nice whipped marshmallow vanilla. It\u2019s not too young or too mature and heavy. It last about 4 hours which is great especially for the price point. Although I would def pay more for an intense version.  I didn\u2019t think I was a jasmine or vanilla girl but this is great."

Now Hard to Get has more to it, an oomph (extra note that gives it an airy and slightly leathery feel through the top to the bottom notes, like a dimension!) that the Kayali one doesn't have; also I prefer  Hard to Get because the Kayali one turns to skin scent 10 minutes later and the lemon sugar notes disappear. Because it's a hype, I am not risking letting it sit forever to find out if it will ever perform or not, even for a small bottle (not worth it). I like this perfume (Hard to Get) and also like her pink bottle (I am Her?) and I stand behind the scent of Hard to Get. It doesn't last as long as I would like it to (which is all day) but it lasts at least a half day for me; but I'm willing to let it sit and see if it will get better with time."

They were in and out of stock online - I initially bought two online for in-store pickup, then found the other two in-store when I went to get my order and purchased them while I was there.   Let me just say that my taste in perfume and my collection is very heavily vanilla based. I am admittedly a fan of ForvrMood. Jackie has said that her taste leans heavily towards gourmand scents, and I love the scent of a lot of the candles, so I had very high expectations.   BUT- an influencer is an influencer, so I started with the travel sizes just so I wouldn\u2019t be out a couple hundred just to be disappointed.  And yet, I am disappointed. The fragrances are cute but give off a less mature B&BW or VS body spray vibe vs what I expected from a grown EDP launch. There is little to no projection. And the longevity is about non-existent. I tried each one during the day and overnight and the results are the same.   My order for favorites: 1. Hard to Get 2. I Am Her 3. NDA 4. You Remind Me  NDA could be great in the colder weather if it lasted. These were really just OKAY. I would probably only repurchase Hard to Get in the travel size only. The reviews seem overhyped, so I just wanted to give an honest perspective."

It is SWEET, but not in a heavy or caramel way. The scent is soft but silage and lasting power is strong, 5 hours since I put it on and I can still smell it on me. The citron isn't too strong on me, it doesn't smell citrusy, it compliments the other notes instead. The scent is simple and well blended, I can smell the quality of the perfume itself. The jasmine and vanilla don't compete but blend, the citron supports but doesn't overwhelm. The citron instead makes it lighter than what I usually think of a gourmand to be. On me it doesn't smell like cake or dessert specifically, but it is VERY sweet. I've been looking for something that's sweet without the heaviness of caramel or praline, happy to have found this to fill that space."

However, once this dried and settled on my skin, it became softer, creamier, definitely yummier. Lemon-vanilla pound cake is a good description. Sweet, but not sticky sweet or too tangy.

When Jackie announced that she was going to be releasing her I was so excited! I am an avid collector of perfumes and was so excited to add her scents to my collection. I received mine about a week ago and I\u2019ve been holding off on making a review because I wanted to fully test its wear time, etc! Right off the bat, I love this fragrance, it has a nice vanilla base with some notes of jasmine. However, as it dries down, it has a sickeningly, sweet, cough syrup scent. The bottle does not seem consistent with Jackie\u2019s luxurious branding that she has built for herself! This bottle seems cheap, and honestly it looked like a perfume that you would buy at Walmart when I first saw it. The font and branding, for this just looks super outdated. For wear time, I was honestly so disappointed. I drowned myself in the perfume\u2026 I mean like 10 sprays, at least, and the scent was gone in an hour. For the perfume being almost $80 I\u2019m disappointed that the wear time is equivalent to that of a body spray."

The Hard to Get fragrance from Forvr Mood tantalizes with a delightful combination of Citron Zest, Sheer Jasmine, and Whipped Vanilla notes. The citrusy brightness of Citron Zest pairs elegantly with the delicate floral essence of Sheer Jasmine, creating an uplifting and feminine aroma. The addition of Whipped Vanilla adds a creamy, comforting sweetness that rounds out the fragrance beautifully. This captivating blend is perfect for those who appreciate a sophisticated yet playful scent that leaves a lasting impression."

The lemon is like sweet lemon candy as opposed to a more lemon cake vibe, then the jasmine isn\u2019t too strong it just adds balance to it. The lemon actually sticks around for a long time which is hard to get! Usually citrus notes are the first to disappear but I still smell it lightly with the whipped vanilla in the dry down hours later! Are the bottles my favorite? No. I thought she would do something a little more sleek but at this price point, being at Sephora, to reach a wider audience I think Miss Jackie knows exactly what she\u2019s doing! Congrats!"

The one thing I would critique is the box that it comes in. Feels very cheap, kind of like the ones you get from knock off perfumes from the flea market. I guess for the price I\u2019m not too mad at it since the bottle, which is plastic, is very beautiful\u2026and the fact that is a diamond shaped inspired by Jackie Aina\u2019s engagement ring, it\u2019s a beautiful personal touch!!!

Very unique which I love as I like to display my perfume collection. The first spritz was complex. I smelled vanilla and perhaps a bit of musk but also some type of citrus. After it dried down it left a beautiful strong yet soft, warm vanilla scent. Not gourmand per se. I generally don\u2019t care for warm scents but this is absolutely beautiful! It lasts and lasts too! One or two spritzes is all you need and I promise the next day you\u2019ll still smell it on your body and clothing. However don\u2019t get it twisted, it is not overwhelming, overpowering, or anything else negative. This is a fabulous fragrance and I look forward to try of Forvr Mood\u2019s perfume!"

The fragrance has key notes of jasmine, lemon, and vanilla frosting which is perfect for the fresh citrus, sweet floral scent that I always look for in a perfume. Hard To Get is sweet and memorable and the lasting power is amazing!"

It has a transparent, crystal clear, diamond cut bottle as you can see. This perfume has the sophisticated scent mix of the hint of bright, citrus from lemon zest, the floral of jasmine and sweet of vanilla. For me it is perfect for summer. The floral scent lingers around for a while. Suitable for daily wear. This perfume became my favorite. Thanks to Skeepers and Forever Mood sending me this beautiful perfume to try out."
