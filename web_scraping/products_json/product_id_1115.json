I'm intrigued to layer it with one of my woody perfumes to see if it balances the sweetness."

It's smells really good, manly and woodsy main notes with a tiny hint of floral that comes out after its been on the skin. What I'm struggling with is that one of the underlying scent notes reminds me of an aftershave more then a cologne. The cologne lasts most the day and can be a bit strong at first but it does slowly fade through out the day. The main scent notes I really do like, but once the scent settles and the under notes come out that aftershave smell hits and reminds me of an old man aftershave smell.  I did receive a sample of this cologne for free in exchange for my honest review from influenster."

I have had men and women try this and it lasts for a while compared to others. Although itu2019s not marketed to be unisex i think it could be due to its fresh nature, especially for women who donu2019t like the lightness of most womenu2019s fragrances. And for the price, youu2019re getting a good amount of product and you wonu2019t need much at all. *I did receive this to try but that does not effect my review of the prouduct*"

We were in bed, no sweating, no moving, just watching a movie and the scent was gone in a hour. We reapplied but this time with Vaseline first and then really dabbing it into the skin and then on his shirt and it did last a bit longer but not past 3 hours. So while it does smell really good...itu2019s just not worth purchasing, in my honest opinion."

All the notes blend nicely to give you that earthy/woody seductive musk. Itu2019s one of those scents that you just cannot stop smelling. For me, the cedar and sandalwood really pop with the citrus spice from the bergamot. The only downside I see is longevity of wear. My husband sprayed his shirt and wrists at 10am and by 230pm the scent is completely faded on the wrists and faint on the shirt but still smells nice. Perhaps the spray covers larger area with larger bottles and expels more product but with 3 sample size sprays across the chest and 1 on each of the wrists it just didnu2019t last as long as we had liked. Would definitely buy a larger bottle!!"

I am a big fan of this scent and feel like at least on me it errs on the more masculine side but I could still wear it and enjoy it as a female who likes very feminine floral scents. It's very musky on me. It reminds me of a teakwood type of smell probably from the sandalwood."

It's classic with a fresh masculine scent. It's not heavy but has good projection/sillage without being overwhelming.
