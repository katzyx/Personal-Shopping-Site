Also skin felt moisturizered for much longer than usually so I'm very pleased with this serum. Didn't consider using such a unexpensive skincare for myself but now I might try other products from this company. The downside is that bottle wasn't sealed."

I wish it was in a dropper form or any other type of bottle too easily apply it on the skin and get the correct amount. But enough about the bottle let's get into the serum itself. It is going to be a thicker hyaluronic acid serum that I'm used to. I typically use the ordinary which is going to be a little more watery. This is a little bit thicker and absolutely feels like heaven applied to the skin. It dries super quickly and makes my skin feel refreshed, hydrated and looking healthy.

I also have to point out that I wish more product came in such a travel/purse friendly container. The price is so great, I can throw this in the makeup bag, one in the travel bag, one here one there. Great product!"

A little bit goes a long way and it absorbs really quickly. It doesn't leave behind a residue, and I feel like it almost evens out my skin texture. My bumps and acne scars aren't as pronounced and it makes application of makeup smoother. The best part of course is the hydrating factor. I have super oily skin and most products make my face shiny.

What I found is it keeps the moisture in my skin, and makes it feel softer and smoother than with the serum products alone.

And unlike regular face serum, you technically donu2019t have to wait before adding another product or start doing makeup.

My skin has been hydrated and healthy since I started using it."

            "review_text": "The Inkey List Hyaluronic Acid Serum comes in a compact plastic bottle with a matte feel and flip top lid. Though a standard 1 oz size filled to the brim with product, it appears an inch shorter than other same volume products that comes in glass bottles as it is sans dropper. Seems great for travel with a firm fitting lid.  Compared to other similar products, the consistency is runnier and lighter weight while still being a serum. It hydrates and plumps, and does not sting or burn like humectant forward serums can. However if worn alone in dry rooms there is a sensation of drying out.   Instructions differ from applying to u201cdamp skinu201d to applying on u201ccleansedu201d skin. If applied on dry cleanser skin, the serum feels a touch tacky. If applied on damp skin (such as after toner) some of that tackiness dissipates. (The label emphasizes using the product as the very first in your routine; however it sounds as though applying after toner should be fine if damp skin is also ok, as toner is mostly water.)  This product box claims u201c2% pure hyaluronic acidu201d and has sodium hyaluronate as its third ingredient with u201chyaluronic acidu201d further down. Having both sounds common in formulas for different hydration properties.   Underneath it also claims u201c2% Matrixyl 3000,u201d which is a trademarked name for a peptide blend manufactured by Sederma consisting of palmitate tetrapeptide-7 and palmitoyl tripeptide-1.   Matrixyl 3000 is considered to be the newer, advanced form of Matrixyl. However, Matrixyl 3000 is clinically tested to be effective at 3%, and the peptides on the box appear last in the ingredients list. Below regulated 1% phenoxyethanol reservative and usually 0.5% radish root ferment filtrate.   While I canu2019t speak to this discrepancy, my experience has been positive. My oily, dehydrated skin is subtly but noticeably plumper in look and feel. The product is also not prone to pilling in my multi step skincare routine. I can recommend it."

It even has a pronunciation guide so that you can feel confident saying it correctly if youu2019re unfamiliar with anything in the name. It makes it feel really accessible for those just starting to take an interest in skincare, while also providing a great reference and reminder for those who are already more confident and knowledgeable about skincare. The bottle itself is unremarkable in a plastic bottle, but I did like that it was easy to dispense just a drop at a time. The serum consistency is less watery than others, more of a thin gel-like consistency. It applies easily though, and it absorbs so quickly for me!! When I did a skin test on my hand, it took a little bit longer to absorb, so this might vary based on skin type (I have combo/oily skin). After it absorbed, my skin did feel more hydrated, and there was no stickiness, shininess, etc. I did notice some slight tightness to my skin afterwards, but I didnu2019t mind it and felt like it helped to firm my skin."

This serum does it's job with keeping my skin hydrated, but I wasn't too wowed by what it had to offer. It does the same thing all my other serums have done. This product is a great, straightforward serum to use for beginners, but I don't think it's something I would use as a replacement of my other serums. I'll use it more as an adjunct."

I rinsed it off and tried it on wet skin. It did a little better in the moisture area at first but still left a tacky feeling that eventually faded along with a lot of the moisture. My skin still had a silky smooth feel to it but was dry until I added my regular moisturizer.   u2022 I've only been using it for a few days, and honestly it's not bad, but I feel It's not something I could use on its own during the colder months, and there are better lightweight and thicker hyaluronic acid serums out there that can provide better moisture and results.   FYI - My skin is sensitive dry/combination that gets drier during the colder months."

I have used sooooo many different brands of hyalauronic acid and this is the first time it has clumped up. Its super annoying!! Do not recommend!"

            "review_text": "### The Inkey List Hyaluronic Acid Serum Review  I recently incorporated The Inkey List Hyaluronic Acid Serum into my skincare routine, and here are my thoughts on its performance and effectiveness:  **Performance:** This serum delivers impressive hydration. My skin feels noticeably more moisturized and plump after each application. The lightweight formula absorbs quickly, leaving no sticky residue, which makes it perfect for layering under other products.  **Application:** Applying the serum is straightforward. I use it both morning and night after cleansing and before applying any heavier creams or oils. The consistency is smooth and spreads easily across the skin, which means a little goes a long way. It fits seamlessly into my routine without any fuss.  **Ingredients:** The main active ingredient is hyaluronic acid, known for its ability to retain moisture. This serum also includes Matrixyl 3000, a peptide that supports skin firmness and elasticity. The formulation is simple yet effective, free from unnecessary additives, making it suitable for sensitive skin.  **Results:** After a few weeks of consistent use, my skin feels softer and looks more radiant. The serum has helped reduce the appearance of fine lines, likely due to the increased hydration. My skin's texture has improved, and it appears more even-toned. I also appreciate that it doesn't cause any breakouts or irritation, which can be a concern with new skincare products.  **Overall Impression:** The Inkey List Hyaluronic Acid Serum is an excellent addition to any skincare regimen, particularly if you are looking to boost hydration and improve skin texture. It offers high performance at an affordable price point, making it accessible for many. Given its clean formulation and effective results, I highly recommend it for anyone seeking to enhance their skin's moisture levels and overall appearance."

While hyaluronic acid is known for its hydrating properties, I found this product to be rather mediocre in performance.  One of the main issues I encountered was with the product packaging. The bottle design made it difficult to dispense the right amount of product, often leading to either too much or too little being dispensed. Additionally, the cap didn't always close securely, which caused some leakage and messiness, making it less than ideal for travel or on-the-go use.  In terms of effectiveness, I didn't notice any significant improvement in my skin's hydration levels or overall appearance. While it did provide some moisture, it wasn't anything remarkable compared to other hyaluronic acid serums I've tried.  Overall, while the Inkey List Hyaluronic Acid may be budget-friendly, its lackluster performance and poor product packaging make it difficult for me to recommend it wholeheartedly."

It squeezes out of the bottle easily enough into my hands but without dripping, so it's pretty easy to apply with fingers, no need for cotton rounds or a tool. It spreads easily as well. It is lightweight and absorbs pretty quickly, but it leaves a slightly tacky feeling on my skin and looks a little shinier than my skin does with just my moisturizer. It does layer well, I haven't experienced any pilling or anything when putting moisturizer on top of it or a thinner toner underneath. It doesn't have any fragrance or scent that I notice. I've only been using for a few days and haven't really noticed much of a difference. No irritation, but my skin doesn't look or feel particularly more moisturized/hydrated or plumped.  The bottle is opaque, which is kind of annoying because I prefer to able to see how much volume I have left of my products. It is small enough to travel easily (about the size of a typical bottle of eye drops) and doesn't have the bulk of a dropper and the lid seems secure, but I do wish either the bottle or the box had come with a seal just to make sure none spilled out or was used before it got to me.  In general I would say it's okay, perfectly fine but not something that is so good that I would repurchase."

This serum has been a game-changer for my skin, delivering outstanding hydration and leaving me with a noticeably plumper and more youthful complexion. First and foremost, I was impressed by the simplicity and transparency of The Inkey List's formulation. The serum contains 2% hyaluronic acid, which is a powerhouse ingredient known for its ability to attract and retain moisture. The absence of unnecessary additives or fragrances makes it suitable for all skin types, including sensitive skin like mine. One of the standout features of this serum is its lightweight and easily absorbed texture. Upon application, it effortlessly sinks into the skin, delivering an instant burst of hydration without any greasiness or residue. I found it particularly effective when applied to damp skin, as it helps to lock in the moisture and enhance its benefits. After incorporating The Inkey List Hyaluronic Acid Serum into my routine, I noticed a significant improvement in the overall hydration of my skin. My complexion appeared plumper, smoother, and more radiant. Fine lines and dry patches were visibly diminished, and my skin felt supple and nourished throughout the day. Additionally, this serum worked wonders in enhancing the efficacy and absorption of my other skincare products. I also appreciate the packaging of The Inkey List Hyaluronic Acid Serum. The sleek and minimalistic design not only looks great on my vanity but also ensures that the product remains fresh and protected from exposure to light and air. The dropper dispenser allows for precise and hygienic application, ensuring that I can use the perfect amount each time. Furthermore, I must highlight the affordability of this product. The Inkey List has always been known for offering high-quality skincare at an accessible price point, and this serum is no exception."

I tried removing some of my regular serums and found that only using this one, made me miss my regular products.  This is okay for what it is, however I prefer my skincare to be a more cosmetically elegant.  I want to the experience of using it.  This serum is just a bit one note for my liking.  I prefer my other serums that incorporate HA as an ingredient.  This one hasn't done anything bad to my skin.  But it hasn't done anything great either. If you already have a very basic routine that you like and just want to add a little something to it, this is fine.  If you already have other products with HA in them, you likely do not need this.

            "review_text": "I've been using hyaluronic acid serums in my skincare routine for almost two decades and have tried them from all different brands - clinical brands, cosmetic brands, clean brands, luxury brands, drugstore brands, etc. This one from The Inkey List performs beautifully and I was happy to receive another bottle as gratis during the holidays. I've been incorporating it into my morning skincare routine since then and have enjoyed how it keeps my skin soft, hydrated and supple.   This is my honest and authentic opinion, as a Sephora Beauty Insider Community Ambassador.   SKIN TYPE: normal to dry and becomes more dry the further we get into winter  SKIN CONCERNS: dehydration, dryness/lack of moisture   WHAT I LIKE:  * Affordable and effective * Lightweight  * Not sticky or tacky  * Absorbs quickly and smoothly  * Packaging is simple, clean, minimalist (but see below) * Layers nicely * Moisturizing / hydrating  * Performs well under makeup - no pilling  AREA(S) FOR IMPROVEMENT:  * Would love to know how much product is left or remaining - maybe with a thin-ish clear strip so you can see how much product is in the bottle? * Would love to see ingredients list on the bottle itself, together with instructions that it should be followed up promptly with a moisturizer * Would be nice if this has a dropper (but that would increase the cost)  FYI: * On the watery side consistency-wise, but has just enough viscosity to keep it from dripping everywhere; it does run a bit though   * Contains peptides (known for their anti-aging properties) * Unscented  * Suitable for all skin types (unless you are allergic to or have a sensitivity to hyaluronic acid or another ingredient in the product). Iu2019ve used this when my skin has been combo oily as well as normal to dry/very dry and it has performed beautifully regardless of my skin type.   BUY ud83dudecdufe0f or BYE ud83dudc4bud83cudffc?:  * This isn't just a good hyaluronic acid serum for the price; it's a good hyaluronic acid serum, period.  * BUY"

I was pretty excited to receive this since I have severely dehydrated skin that I end up picking at and before I know it I have destroyed my skin barrier! I have been trying to find a solution to this and I believe I found one!  Dehydrated skin is caused by lack of water which leaves skin dull and dry skin is caused by lack of oil which causes flakiness. I suffer from both dehydrated and dry skin unfortunately.  First you want to make sure you start off with a clean face, then make sure you add some water to make your face damp (I get mine pretty wet) because this is a hydrator which increases the water content in your skin and it cannot do so without water and will often result in dryer skin if you donu2019t use it properly. Anyways after applying this you can apply any toners, exfoliating treatments, target treatments or eye treatments. I like to use a vitamin c serum after and then make sure to follow that with a moisturizer! This is a very important step since it helps seal the moisture into the skin!   This is recommended to do both in the AM and PM however, I would be sure to apply a SPF in the morning (last, after everything else).  This has helped me tremendously in repairing my skin so far and I am hopeful that with this in my beauty arsenal I will finally break free from this lackluster skin and have healthy, glowing and well hydrated skin! This has a wonderful price tag  however I do wish it were available in a larger size because this wonu2019t last too long. I plan on purchasing this again and trying more products from The INKEY List as well!!"

I use this duo on my face, neck and chest and I can even go as far as to say that I have gotten relatively clearer skin in those areas, it leaves a sticky look when you put it on, but after it dries completely, you don't feel it, I would like to give it 10 stars, I really recommend it highly in my experience."

I've used a couple of different HAs or things containing HA including the ordinary version. The only thing giving the ordinary the edge is that their bottle is glass (I believe both companies are owned by the same people though). I like this one the best by far, it feels less thick and oily than others I've tried, it absorbs really well and isn't sticky and it's a really good price. My skin is well hydrated, obviously pairing this with a good moisturizer is key, which moisturizer will depend on your skin. This won't do anything helpful without moisturizer! I always stock up on this when I get to go to sephora, rather than risking running out and having to grab the ordinary from ulta.  HA is a key important part of my routine, I definitely see and feel a difference if I skip it. I'm 34 and have tried all sorts of skincare but HA is here to stay for me, it makes a big difference in how my skin feels (not tight or dry, bouncy, plump, soft)."

I find a lot of people seem to not understand fully what HA is or how it works, it is not a moisturizer in itself, HA helps your skin retain moisture. It's the first thing I apply after washing my face and/or stepping out of the shower, while my skin is still a little damp even, and it works so well! Very comparable to much more expensive product when using correctly. MY only con is the packaging, I really wish it had a dropper or pump, something to help control the amount of product you get.

The best way to apply it is onto wet/damp skin, ideally after cleansing, then let it sink in and seal it in with a moisturizer. If you skip those steps it can actually make you even drier.  The reason is that this serum mainly contains humectants (hyaluronic acid + glycerin) which are ingredients that grab onto water molecules. If there's not enough water around then the humectants can actually suck the water out of your skin instead. And without any barrier on top it'll all just evaporate away. So make sure you pair it with water and a good moisturizer!"

Itu2019s a small bottle but you do not need more than a small amount. Especially when you apply to damp skin. It glides on smooth and doesnu2019t pill with other skincare products, sunscreen, or makeup. Gentle on my skin and did not sting or cause any irritation. Does the job of the $40+ HA products.

Very similar to other formulas from other more expensive brands and I love the added bonus of the Matrixyl 3000! I donu2019t know how much is in there but for under $8 as an added bonus, Iu2019ll take it! The formula is a very light, almost watery gel and it absorbs very quickly into skin. It does leave skin a bit tacky for a minute but thatu2019s a plus when applying makeup most of the time and if youu2019re using it before bed you should be topping it with an occlusive and emollient moisturizer anyway which takes away that tackiness. Plus more expensive serums also leave this tackiness, I donu2019t really think of it as a negative. Just be sure you are using your hyaluronic acid serums correctly because if applied wrong they can have the opposite effect and dry your skin out more by sucking moisture from the skin. You should apply it to a damp face (either freshly washed or sprayed with water or mist) and then top it with an emollient and occlusive moisturizer to lock the moisture in. Anyway, definitely worth a try!"

You really canu2019t beat the price, so if youu2019re on a budget it might be a good one to pick up, but I think Iu2019ll stick to my other hyaluronic products (I like dr Dennis gross hyaluronic marine hydration booster) even though theyu2019re more expensive"

I have been using this for over six months now, day and night, right after I wash/cleanse and tone my face. This provides instant hydration. I love this product and would recommend it to anyone.  The only reason I give this 4/5 is the bottle/nozzle. This product would be better suited in a dropper style bottle/applicator. I find that the nozzle/lid, where the product comes from, clogs SO easily. I store this with the lid upright, and the product can kind of form a seal/glue over the opening (I find this starts to happen about 1/3 through the bottle), and the lid clogs. Although I have become u201cused tou201d this, it doesnu2019t make it any less annoying. So many times I will be trying to gently get product out, and the nozzle will be clogged, so I try with slightly more pressure, and (more often than not), a massive amount of product comes out.  Of course I can make use of this product by extending it onto my neck or perhaps applying to the tops of my hands, but I know how much of this product I need at a time, and donu2019t appreciate u201cwastingu201d product on areas I donu2019t intend to use the product (however great it may be)."

You can mix this in with a moisturizer, use with another serum, put on your lips, your eyes, your body moisturizer, your HAIR, your dried up makeup products, whatever you want girl! She does it all! Literally!   My favorite uses: I love using this on my lips as a prep before lip balm or lipstick. I have also added this to the tips of my hair after swimming for extra moisturizer along with a leave in conditioner. When my ABH brow pomade was dry and gross, I added a drop and mixed it up. Now the product acts as if itu2019s brand new. Added it to my dry HUDA beauty foundation and created somewhat of a tinted moisturizer. When I had eye dermatitis I applied a little bit to help reduce the flaking and itchiness and it made them feel so much better!   Itu2019s safe for all skin types and has so many uses!!!!! If youu2019re oily, this would be great to balance out your skin and restore your moisture barrier!!   I seriously have no bad things to say about this product, itu2019s a staple and Iu2019ll always have multiples on hand for basically anything. Do yourself a favor and get it!

I have dry patches, I get oily throughout the day (who doesn't?) but I do need hydration. I don't like using heavy or oily products during the day or night.   I didn't find this product bad, necessarily. But it didn't REALLY hydrate me much. It did feel nice on the skin, it soaked into the skin quite fast and it layered well with many brands of skincare..Lancu00f4me, Fresh, Moon Juice, etc. It also played well with makeup products..but it just didn't give my skin the big drink of hydration it needs before using makeup or even overnight."

I have no acne issues and my skin reacts really quickly if it doesn't like something. I didn't put a lot on my face: I cleansed, I put on the hyaluronic acid and finished with a moisturizer. The pimple was there the next morning. I waited 2 weeks and tried again during a night routine and  BAM, the next morning, another huge cystic pimple on my lower jaw. I had to return. I now use the Vichy 89 with no issues."

I also use tretnoin (a prescription strength retnoid) to treat my acne. I find that my skin often craves hydration and this stuff is like a tall drink of water for your skin. It feels so hydrating and it plumps the skin. It also is light and easy to layer with other products. I also like how this has some peptides to support the skin. And the price is really the best part, like, you canu2019t beat it. Now, you have to use this correctly for it to work. First, you have to apply it on damp or moist skin, so either after your toner and essence or you can literally just spray your face with water and your pat it in (thatu2019s what I do). This is because hylaronic acid is a humectant that draws moisture into the skin, but you need to provide the hylaronic acid with that water for it to draw moisture in instead of drawing moisture out form your skin and dehydrate your skin. Using it over damp skin also prevents any tackiness. You also must use a moisturizer after to continue providing it with moisture. I use this in the morning and it is really nice, love how it plumps the skin."

I use a generous amount morning and evening and it lasted me 4 months! It worked way better for me that The Ordinaryu2019s HA serum. I ran out of it two weeks ago an decided to try out Glow Recipesu2019s Plum Plump HA serum because of the VIB sale discount and because I love their products, but I actually much prefer the Inky Listu2019s because it gives me the same results (maybe even a bit more hydration?), but it applies so much better than Glow Recipeu2019s. GR gets kind of white and frothy when I work it into my skin, and can sometimes pill under makeup depending on what other products I use with it. I switch up my moisturizers and extra serums every other day because of clashing ingredients, and I never had an issue with pilling with this one as opposed to GR. Once I finish plum plump Iu2019ll for sure come back to this HA serum.   *also a tip: I mix in a few drops of The Ordinaryu2019s Amino Acids + B5 into my HA serum to create a more liquid texture to work into my skin better and boost hydration with the added benefits of the amino acids and vitamin B5. Itu2019s really been helping with the dry patches Iu2019m experiencing due to using prescription retinol cream."

I also have asthma and fragrance sensitivities so the way a product smells is make or break for me. Lately my routine, which has worked well for a while, just hasn't been doing it for me anymore. I've developed texture on the part of my cheeks near my nose and mouth and the surface there peels after just a few hours. It didn't matter how I exfoliated, the only time my skin wasn't getting shriveled and flaky was when I had a layer of vaseline over the top of my skincare.   Glycerin and vitamin E oil helped, but not enough, so I decided to try hyaluronic acid. WOW. I've been using it for 2 days and it's made a visible difference already. The shriveled texture in the super dry cheek area is almost gone, the smile lines that were starting to form have started to plump back up, and the fine lines around my eyes are gone on one eye (the good eye) and reduced on the other.  I did a patch test on my arm, a patch test on my face, and have used it over my whole face 4 times, and no reaction. If my skin doesn't like something it gets red bumps in less than a minute and so far, everything is clear. It doesn't have a fragrance (thank you Inkey!) or a chemical smell that bothers my lungs. Make sure you apply it to damp skin, and that it's the first thing you put on. On one side of my face I tried it layered the way I do glycerin, which is over my moisturizer and eye cream (I have to apply the glycerin that way for it to work), but it actually worked better on the side of my face where I applied it the way Inkey recommended, which is as the first layer.   I also got the Inkey collagen booster and will review that when I've used it a few days to see how my skin likes it. I didn't want to try it until I had a chance to assess how the HA worked for me. The hyaluronic acid from Inkey is a keeper for me!"

I was scared to use it wrong, and end up drier, plus I also usually buy higher end products, so I was skeptical. People are not joking, this thing is superrrr tiny (looks trial sized) and only half full, but for $7 whatever. After my first use my skin felt plump and hydrated like never before!!! I am absolutely shook and never going back. You just have to make 100% sure you follow the HA rules- apply on wet skin and lock in with a moisturizer. The packaging is awesome too, tells you eveything you need to know about HA, how to use it, what step it goes at in your routine, and how to amplify it's benefits based on your needs (what to pair with if you want to target dullness, fine lines, more hydration, etc.).

I wasn't sure if it was this Hyaluronic Acid or the Paula's Choice Vitamin C Serum (I used them in that order), but after reading reviews and omitting this product in my skincare routine today, this Hyaluronic Acid is definitely what caused a bad reaction. Also did not notice any moisturizing benefits whatsoever. I don't recommend this."

I don't know if I will need to use this every day now that the weather is warmer, but I wish I had discovered it sooner during the cold months.  This will definitely have a spot in my rotation.  Of course, the value is outstanding.  The only thing I don't love about this product is the packaging.

Before it soaks in completely I pat in my moisturizer.   The only downside to this product, as I've found with many others in the INKEY list's line, is that the packaging is terrible. It's hard to adjust how much product is coming out of the bottle. It also feels cheap because of the plastic packaging.   All in all, a great basic hyaluronic acid. Would repurchase again!"

But it doesn't work either way. And I don't want to have to hassle to make a hyaluronic acid (or any step of my skin care) to work for me. The Ordinary Marine Hyaluronics worked just fine for me after pat drying my face right after washing it and makeup/sunscreen went on smoothly when I put my moisturizer over it. Will be steering friends away from The Inkey List Hyaluronic Acid. Not worth the extra dollar from The Ordinary. Even non-skincare brands have better products."

I definitely recommend keeping this in the bathroom so you can apply it right after you wash your face since it works best on damp skin, and then I follow with a gel based moisturizer to lock in all the moisture. This is amazing for the low price point but I just wish the packaging was better. sometimes I accidentally pour out too much, I think a dropper would be better but got the price itu2019s not a big deal."

The big reason is that, and I'm not sure if it was coincidental, but the night I switched to this HA my active night products didn't cause any sort of discomfort. 24 hours prior to that, while I used up the last of a competing brand HA, I was toughing out an intense burning sensation from my evening products. These products were working to repair my moisture barrier and basically the dryer the skin, the harsher it feels and I would tough it out with tearful eyes until the following night when I tried this product and didn't feel a thing from my active products. I'm wondering if the other brand may have been causing dryness to my face if that's the case? Either way, I have noticed that my skin has felt and looked plumper/healthier after switching to this formula.  I also appreciate how thin this formula is, that there's no weird smell, it doesn't emulsify and it doesn't dry down sticky...all of which my previous HA had a tendency of."

It helped balance my skin in my more oily to normal areas of my face but dried me out in my problem areas(around my mouth and sides of my cheeks). After looking more into hyaluronic acid (something I should have done before) I realize it could possibly be due to the environment/climate that I live in. This acid is meant to draw in moisture from the air but, since I live in a dry climate (So Cal) that is not what happened. It felt either dry or like I didnu2019t have it on to begin with. This would probably work a lot better for someone that lives in a more humid climate since there is so much more moisture."

At the end of the week, I have a small break out on my nose and my forehead. I normally donu2019t break out. I donu2019t think my skin needs to adjust to these products, I really donu2019t think I am going to continue using them. I feel like my skin is somewhat getting worse, my forehead looks dryer in some spots now and I noticed some lines were I normally didnu2019t notice anything.   Also the bottle.. becareful, when you squeeze it out; you get more then a pea size. Better design is warranted.  Two stars because it seems to work for others, But itu2019s just not for me. My skin become a little bit more picky after my pregnancy, but I was hoping with these price points I could find something worth having. I used to use the fresh products; that started causing break outs too. Herbivore lapis oil and dr jart cream helped calm my skin down over night from the use of the inkey list products I mentioned; guess I will stick with those."

I bought this with the beta-hydroxy acid (this one hydrates and the beta purifies) and theyu2019re just awesome. I sometimes donu2019t even put on day or night cream. I find the serums so light that you can put on your other beauty products without any problem. I rarely experience bad acne but it happened recently and didnu2019t know how to get my normal skin back. I also sometimes notice red bumps on my skin in the morning. When I started using this, I saw how everything started clearing. It helped with redness, acne, scarring. I highly recommend this and with another acid if you have oily, acne prone skin. Thank you to the company and Sephora for this great product!"

Since HA holds moisture, you should have damp skin at the time of application so that there's something for the HA to suck in. I also like to spray with a mist after application to add some extra hydration. Knocking a star off as I HATE the bottle it comes in - the plastic is cheap and it's too hard to control how much comes out at once.

I did not like the type of dispenser/container that the Inkey List chose, I prefer a dropper (however The Ordinary needs to improve their dropper).

I've tried using this on both wet and dry skin and it leaves my skin sticky either way, though a little less sticky when used on wet skin. Plus the amount of product you get is NOT an oz. Its probably more like 0.07 oz. Yeah I know its only $8 or whatever, but I still want what they are saying they are selling me! Overall, I'm not really impressed with anything I've tried from this brand, and I probably won't be repurchasing this product either. Sorry The Inkey List."

Thankfully, the smell does not linger at all, and I prefer this to having artificial or covering up fragrances added. We all know by now that there's no place in skincare for fragrance or scents.  As far as the product itself, it's a nice gel texture that absorbs nicely and helps my skin feel more hydrated and plump. The price is right and packaging is great.

I have been looking for a substitute product for Sunday Riley's Good Genes, because the cost for that is astronomical and I am really trying not to make overpriced skincare a lifestyle choice over here. I read a few articles that recommended the Inky list Hyaluronic and the ceramide night serum, so at this price point I figured why not and threw both in my cart.   The Hyaluronic acid alone steals the show- I've tried against Hyaluronic acid from The Ordinary and it came out as the real winner. I also tried it against The Ordinary's Lactic Acid + HA, and decided that the Inkey list one works better for my skin during the day, and the Lactic Acid is better for night (+ the ceramide night treatment). I use this product as the first thing on my skin after washing my face in the morning. I don't usually wear much on top of it because it really makes my skin feel plump smooth and hydrated, but have tried with primer (benefit porefessional) and power or liquid foundation as well (bare minerals matte formula)- both went on super smooth and blended in even more beautifully than on top of a regular cream/face lotion. On top of that, this tiny little bottle has lasted me wayyy longer than I feel like it should have (going on month three here for an $8 product)  TLDR; I am HOOKED on this serum - for the price and the results, this has served me better than La Mer, Sunday Riley, Tatcha or Laneige. Stocking up now after seeing some of the other Inkey products have sold out so quickly"

It applies easily to skin, doesnu2019t smell, and actually feels like itu2019s absorbing into the skin and not just sitting on top of it. And that ingredient list?? Unmatched! It is such a perfect HA serum. I have normal skin (oily during summer, dry during winter) that can lean a little more on the oily side from living in the desert, so this is a great serum for my skin all year round.

I started using this product about a week ago, both AM/PM, and it is clearing up my breakouts!!! My skin is prone to dryness & I think this added layer of moisture is helping it even out/manage oil production. I looked at many different HA serums, but chose this one because of how affordable it is and that it is u201ccleanu201d. I will definitely definitely continue to repurchase!!!!!!

But most amazingly and rather unexpectedly, my constant and difficult to cover redness (rosacea exacerbated by a blood thinner) has been kept in check truly like never before. I used to have to heavily color correct, then use full coverage foundations and concealer to make it look like I wasnu2019t in the running for Best Tomato at the state fair, but since adding this into my routine twice a day, Iu2019ve been able to dab some tinted moisturizer or skin tint on and be good to go, which is something Iu2019ve honestly never experienced in my 38 years. Itu2019s very light on the skin, not tacky at all, sinks in easily and relatively quickly, and works well with my other serums and oils. I also didnu2019t have any kind of reaction or irritation to it, nor any comedogenic issues. Iu2019ve actually got another bottle already in my cart, because I refuse to live without it.

This one is great, price is very right and honestly this in my opinion holds its own against many prestige Hyaluronic serums Iu2019ve tried over the years.

That said, the one huge positive for this is that it doesnu2019t pill under makeup at all. Once you put moisturizer on, thereu2019s not residue or trace of the product. It really depends on what youu2019re looking for but my skin is dry but overproduces oil to compensate because it doesnu2019t get sufficient hydration. Thatu2019s why I was looking for hyaluronic acid but itu2019s not suitable for my skin; however, for someone with normal or oily skin, this could probably work fine."

Noticing my skin is feeling more plump and texture (my main concern) seems to be diminishing slowly but surely.

Itu2019s hydrating and nice to use. Iu2019ve used less hydrating serums and Iu2019ve used WAY better (mostly in the Korean skincare realm). If you have super dry skin, I donu2019t know if this will be enough. Itu2019s nice for layering and good for the 7 skin method, if thatu2019s something you do. If youu2019re oily, I think you would like this as your hydrator/moisturizer step because it wonu2019t make you greasy whatsoever. Great for daytime and under makeup- no pilling.

The other is from a popular western brand which unfortunately pilled horribly, even when used by itself; I could never get it to work for me.   The INKEY List Hyaluronic Acid Hydrating Serum is hydrating enough for me to wear alone under moisturizer, but also plays well when layered under or over other serums. Iu2019ve had no issues with product pilling when using this which is a major plus is my book. It does have a more watery consistency, compared to the other serums Iu2019ve used, so this might be why it layers so well.  So far, Iu2019m really enjoying this serum and itu2019s definitely a future repurchase."

After which I was able to apply my night cream and had soft glowy skin in the am. This would be a great product for anyone wanting to try a Hyaluronic acid serum, can't beat the price!!

We are currently in winter in New Jersey and this has helped tremendously with dry skin and my face doesnu2019t feel as tight and dry. Keeping my skin well hydrated during the winter which is the only season Iu2019ve been able to use it for so far and not leaving it greasy. Highly recommend especially at this price and seeing how little I use each day. It recommends doing it in the AM and PM but I stuck with just after showers so my skin could really soak it in."

Iu2019ve almost finished my bottle and happy to say that Iu2019ll be buying more! This budget friendly serum has worked amazingly well with my skin. I can already see the difference in my skin texture and sun damaged areas. To me thatu2019s a huge deal because I know the longer I use it the more results Iu2019ll see.   The Inkey List Serum has faded out the really fine lines that I had around my mouth and eyes. And  I can also tell a difference with some of my deeper wrinkles on my forehead, that is what has surprised me the most! My sister came over yesterday and she touched my forehead and asked me what I did, haha! I showed he the bottle and sheu2019s ordering some.   I have to say that this is by far the best results Iu2019ve seen in any serums that Iu2019ve tried and Iu2019ve tried a good amount over the last 5 years. Iu2019m excited to see what continued use will do for my aging skin and to see what other amazing products The Inkey List has! Iu2019m so glad I tried this and I highly recommend it, Iu2019m about to purchase a bottle right now after writing this review!"

Unfortunately my bottle came in the mail with the cap barely even on so over half the liquid was spilled all over. There was only about a third of the bottle left so I was only able to use this for 2 weeks before it was all gone so. Maybe if I had used this longer the results would have been different but oh well. At least I did receive this for free in exchange for an honest review, so I suppose Im not too mad."

I would probably just like to order a bigger size bottle in the future."

I do wash my hands after because it is slightly sticky feeling but it doesn't feel that way on my facial skin and my skin soaks it up quickly. I noticed that my akin is feeling more soft and looking more smoother after continued use. I try and use in the morning after washing my face some days. Then I get dressed before applying other products and makeup so it has time to soak in. Then I use every night after washing my face before bed. It is not greasy or irritating.

I have been using this morning and night as directed for a week to get the most accurate results and I still deal with flaky skin during the day. It hasnu2019t made my face break out as other reviews have stated but it hasnu2019t done enough to make me want to purchase this in the future. I will continue to use this until I run out and will change my review if I start to see better results. 3 stars for smelling good, good price and ease of use."

I use it after cleansing and before my regular serum and/or moisturizer. Some days I use this then skip straight to sunscreen. On its own, it feels a bit sticky but I think the trick is not to use too much product - I find that a dime size is plenty. For me, I prefer my hyaluronic essence that I already own and use so I probably wonu2019t repurchase this. However, if you donu2019t have a hyaluronic acid product in your rotation, I think this is one you may want to start out with - especially at this amazing price point. What this does is preps your skin to retain the rest of your products and makes everything work better. Your face will thank you! I knocked a star only because the hyaluronic ingredient in this product is a bit down on this list - I think #5 or so - and I believe there are superior products out there and the fact this feels sticky. Truly though - for this price?! You canu2019t go wrong. If you hate the sticky feel, you may want to use only at night."

So put it on your skin, follow with your moisturizer, and kiss that dry winter skin goodbye. Right? Unfortunately, all I did was break out pretty badly. After reading all the good reviews, I decided to give it a second try. I still broke out though. This just isn't for me, I suppose."

It adds the hydration I need, especially right now during the winter. I love how it sinks into my skin, but doesn't leave a film or sticky feeling like some serums do. I highly recommend this, especially if your current moisturizer isn't hydrating enough.  It does thin out the moisturizer, but the added hydration is what makes it amazing.  Before this product, I used to use the hydro-boost serum. I think this one is even more hydrating. I have combination skin, and it's been amazing for me so far."

Upon application I found that a little went a long way and it absorbed quickly into my skin so that I could move on to moisturizing rather quickly. My skin felt moisturized as look or feel crepey throughout the day and the fine lines around my eyes seemed softer and less obvious even under mineral makeup.

It absorbs quickly so you can get to layering on the next products and it has yet to interfere with anything else in my routine. The bare-bones ingredients this product line is known for means there arenu2019t pesky fragrances or artificial colors so nothing has irritated my sensitive skin.

Iu2019ve tried high end brands (Peter Thomas Roth $65), moderately priced (like Lu2019Oreal $21) and this texture is by far the best one.

It absorbed quick and well. I think the formula is moisturizing and lightweight as well.

I used these products both day and night it could be just my skin but it did dry my skin out. Now I do like how soft my skin feels though.  A con is the bottle makes it hard to get controlled amount out and can easily over do it."

I love the texture of this one and how quickly it sinks in/never sits on top of the skin. It also sits really well under makeup, which is an issue I had with past serums. This is also so affordable! The simple packaging is a plus as well."

This would probably work best for dehydrated, but oilier skin types, mixed into a mattifying moisturizer. Does not get sticky or greasy throughout the day, though, so that's a major plus!"

This serum is soothing and hydrating at the same time. I mix it with Vitamin C serum in the morning (which locks in the goodness of each product even better) and retinol before bed. Within one week of using these products, my face has felt softer and more hydrated than it has ever been. I highly recommend this product to anyone looking to brighten up their skin and rejuvenate their skin care regime with real, high quality genuine products."
