            "review_text": "The Good: I genuinely enjoyed using this product. I have fine very naturally curly hair that can sometimes be frizzy and unruly. It literally takes a village (of products) to tame this mane sometimes. I feel like this mask added a nice bounce to my natural curls and it also provided a good level of hydration and nourishment without leaving my hair oily like many hair masks which target frizz and include oil in them can do. I really like the way my hair feels after this and I never have a bad hair day after this mask.  The Bad: As much as I like this product, I have a lot of other hair masks that I've been able to compare this to and honestly, there's even better masks out there that perform to a higher standard than this mask does. On top of that, they're a lot cheaper.   The Ugly/Honest: For a hair mask, this doesn't have the standard amount of product (which is usually 8 oz). I much more enjoy the results of CurlSmith Hydro Creme and thats $29/8oz or the SheaMoisture Manuka Honey that goes for $13.99/12 oz. I got this as a free product and despite enjoying it I just can't justify repurchasing it for $43/6.7 oz. Overall, I'd give the product itself 4 stars but I need to take off a star for the price gouging because in my opinion, the price point does not match the performance level."

I can even push hair washes out past a week because it keeps both my ends and scalp hydrated. I was hesitant because I don't think B&B is vegan but honestly I will sacrifice my morals for good hair in this case."

I used points to get a sample of this and I was excited--I have in the past liked B&B's products, even if I don't use them on the regular. The typical hair mask I use is from It's A 10, so I compare all other masks to this by default. I have naturally blonde hair that falls to the top of my hips--so while it's thinner, there is a TON of it and the ends need extra care. I was pleased that the sample was quite big so even I could get two uses out of it (hahaha!) and that's where my pleasant experience abruptly ended. The goop out of the package felt like sticky melted plastic and stupidly I put it on my hair hoping that would somehow change it's state, which it didn't. My hair felt like melted plastic as I waited the 5 min as per instructed. It didn't want to rise out, so I had to work hard to really rinse my hair thoroughly. My damp hair felt awful to the touch, snarly, not soft, plastic-y. Took forever for my hair to air dry (8 hours--are you kidding me?). Now that my hair is dry I'm ready for another shower because my hair looks and feels like Barbie hair and that is not a look. It's slightly better than hay, and honestly my hair sans conditioner of any sort would be better off. Hard NOPE on this one!"

I currently use a $20 deep conditioning mask by Shea Moisture and the results are quite similar.   If this mask was $20 (or gifted to me), I would most definitely use it.

Easily washed from the hair.  I wait only 5 minutes.  The only downside for me was that it added even more volume to my curly hair.  For those who like more volume this will be a plus for him!  A good hair mask really"

I enjoyed this product I felt like it was a wonderful product but not for my hair type. I have pretty normal hair leaning more towards the soft and oily side so this product made my hair much to oily. I already have really soft hair so that added on top of it was not good for my hair. I had to wash my hair more frequently so instead of putting it everywhere on my hair I tried putting it on just the bottoms Or in other words the very very ends. Even after switching it up it still felt and looked pretty greasy so I stopped using it. I felt like this product would be best for the curly haired girls and even recommended it to my cousin who has curly hair. I think this would be a great product for those with dry hair too. The consistency was very thick and felt very nice. It smelled really great too. All in all a good product but not for me."

To start, I have long curly hair so I usually need a conditioner (or mask) that has a ton of slip and where a little can go a long way! The slip factor was again, okay at best. A little certainly did not go a long way but it did get the job done in terms of detangling my locks. The scent was floral and strong \u2014 I usually do not like floral scents but this one wasn\u2019t bad at all! The mask claimed to reduce frizz and it kinda did that? Like I said, I have curly hair so frizz is going to happen. The mask also advertises that it\u2019s hydrating and I will agree with that. It is hydrating it just took me a lot of product to saturate all of my hair.   Pros: pleasant scent, hydrating, some slippage Cons: only 2 uses from the standard bottle, a little does not go a long way  I probably wouldn\u2019t buy it for myself, but I could see where it works well for other hair types."

It does make my hair more manageable for one day after use, but after that it's back to dry and hard to brush at first. I'm currently using it twice a week as opposed to the recommended two. If my hair weren't so bleached and processed, this would work amazing, hence the 4 stars."

The other side of my hair is super healthy since I started taking care of my hair. I have my whole hair care routine but something was missing. A good hair mask! Thank god I received this in the mail. I noticed a difference after the first time using it! The healthy side of my hair was shiny, soft, and tangle free. The damaged side of my hair was also waaaay softer than before and it wasn\u2019t as brittle. The mask has a faint smell to it but it\u2019s not strong. If I had to compare the scent to another product, I would compare it to the Shea Moisture \u201cStrength and Moisture\u201d shampoo. It\u2019s more of a thick formula but that\u2019s pretty common with any type of mask. If you\u2019re Interested and have the money to treat yourself then I would definitely recommend it! I would honestly maybe even bleach my hair again because I know I have this product to help me take care of my hair!"

Left it on while I shaved and washed my face. About 10 minutes, as directed. Then I rinsed it out and that was all I did to my hair.

Additionally, in no way shape or form is my review biased in favor for either company. Now for the review...this is the BEST hair mask I have ever tried! The smell is sweet and musky and the slip is fantastic. It\u2019s not too thick it\u2019s just the right amount of a light & whipped consistency for the hair. I do have bleached and colored hair so often I do see and feel the damage on my hair. Immediately after the shower my hair showed no frizz, no dryness, it looked and felt healthy again! After styling my hair it got even better, my hair had the most gorgeous gloss to it, my hair was soft, shiny, and sleek! People asked if I had gotten a haircut because my hair looked that fresh and beautiful! I will be repurchasing this product and recommending it to all my friends, family, and coworkers. Thank you influenster for this product it has changed my hair"

After just one use of this mask the ends of my hair look like I've had a fresh cut!!!!How does it do it? MAGIC. Best part is how easy it to use and that it's mostly all natural ingredients. I'm a true believer!! Honestly no other product has worked for me like this one, especially after just one use and trust me I've tried many other masks. tip!

This mask contains essential Oils, so leaving in it in the shower for 5 minutes (weekly treatment) gave me very good hydration, which remains until today (24 hrs later) my hair is notoriously silkier, with  shine and with a frizz reduction. conclusion for my wavy hair: this mask is perfect to complement it with a wave definition product and using it weekly to give it the life it lacks to my hair.  Oh and love the smell and creamy texture."

As soon as i opened the tube i noticed its soft floral smell. It\u2019s consistency is like conditioner. I applied it to my hair and waited 5 minutes as recommended. After i rinsed it out i immediately felt smooth and silky hair. My comb went through my hair more easily than usually.  The true test would be when i dried my hair. After blow drying my hair i was extremely satisfied with how it looked. I felt like i just got my hair done at the salon, it was smooth and shiny but not greasy looking. I highly recommend this product for anyone needing a good condition for their hair."
