As with most transplants, one side takes better than the other side, and as my surgeon said, You want them to be 'sisters' not 'twins'. This gel helps them both to look full and more symmetrical.

Also a fan of the applicator wand because it's useful, and my usual brow brush always seems to migrate to the darkest depths of my makeup bag!  Another excellent offering from Kulfi and one I intend to repurchase often."

Kulfi has managed to strike the perfect balance between hold and flexibility. The gel sets my brows in place without leaving them stiff or crunchy, allowing for natural movement throughout the day. Plus, it's infused with nourishing ingredients like castor oil and vitamin E, which not only keep my brows healthy but also promote growth over timeu2014a win-win situation!  What truly sets this brow gel apart, however, is its dual-action design. The volumizing side adds instant fullness and definition to sparse areas, effortlessly filling in any gaps for a fuller-looking brow. On the other hand, the laminating side tames unruly hairs and keeps them in place, resulting in a sleek, polished finish that lasts all day long. Whether I'm going for a bold, statement brow or a more natural, brushed-up look, this gel delivers every time.  The applicator deserves a special mention as well. The unique double-sided brush allows for precise application, making it easy to sculpt and shape brows to perfection. The smaller side is ideal for detailing and defining individual hairs, while the larger side quickly coats the brows for a more voluminous look.  In terms of longevity, I'm thoroughly impressed. Once applied, the gel doesn't budge or smudgeu2014even in humid weather or during intense workouts. I can confidently go about my day knowing that my brows will stay put from morning until night.
