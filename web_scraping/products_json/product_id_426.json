            "review_text": "There are so many mixed reviews about the airwrap all over, but, I really really love mine. I did receive it as a birthday gift. I could not curl my hair at all before the airwrap; couldnu2019t get my hair to hold any styles, always left funny lines/crimps when curling with an iron, getting too hot and flustered cause I just couldnu2019t get my hair to do what I wanted, etc. The airwrap changed all of that for me and now I love doing my hair. For the first time in my life I can curl my hair haha! Even just blow drying, my hair feels much sleeker than a regular hairdryer. I have very long thick hair so I do need to use some products to achieve the best hold, but the machine itself is not heavy or awkward to hold and I find it to be a very versatile machine. I love the strawberry bronze/blush pink colour way as well as I personally did not love any of the previous colour ways. Hands down, this is a fabulous machine and I can achieve so many different styles with it!"

            "review_text": "Decided to finally get the Airwrap during the Sephora sale. It does not disappoint, and my hair routine is much quicker with this as well. It takes a few tries to get used to it, but itu2019s comfortable to hold, and itu2019s not super loud. I love the curling iron, I use it on damp or dry hair (dry hair - high heat & low fan). It gives me big wavy whimsical curls that I canu2019t get with any other hair tools. The blow dryer is great, but I prefer the round brush to dry. I donu2019t understand the difference between the 2 smoothing brushes though, they do the same thing? They work great to smooth any wrinkles out from pony tails, etc. If you want sleek smooth straight hair, you canu2019t achieve that with this tool. If you want the best big bouncy u2018Pantene Pro-Vu2019 commercial hair, itu2019s a must buy!"
