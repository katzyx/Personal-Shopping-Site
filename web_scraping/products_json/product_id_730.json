The moisturizer is sooo nourishing but not greasy or heavy.  The eye cream really helps with plumping and fine lines and has a tint and reflect to it to brighten any darkness. And all are totally free of pore cloggers! <3"

I was not disappointed with the products. The moisturizer is rich, but absorbs well and does seem to give a bit of tightening and lift. The eye cream is good and has a little tint. The gell cleanser also is great at breaking up makeup and the size is perfect for travel. The only critique I have for Innbeauty is about the container.  So although the quantity of product is perfect for travel, the bottle that holds it is too large and heavy - when you open it, the refillable insert takes up only half of the space. It seems so unnecessary."

            "review_text": "I'm shocked this set has good reviews. The moisturizer has the strangest texture I've ever encountered - like a difficult to spread crisco that becomes a liquid and then doesn't hydrate whatsoever.   The eye cream is fine (though also not hydrating) and the cleanser is a typical gel cleanser. I bought this kit because I heard the moisturizer was a dupe for a high end product (which I have admittedly never tried) but omg it's so bad."
