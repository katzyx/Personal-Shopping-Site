I even wore it to a Billie Eilish concert, ate, drank, and it didn\u2019t budge. I need to go back in store to purchase other colors.   Ladies/Gents if you're buying in store CHECK YOUR LIPSTICK before you purchase. My first one just came with the top and no lipstick. Sephora made it right but it was so embarrassing."

You know the one that doesn't come off on your cigarette or your drink or anything else you have your lips on. Thus, I just tapped a little powder on them and it stayed put.

The shade Sonia Light Beige runs cool and looks like a stone color against my warm light skin. It is highly pigmented and you only need 1-2 swipes to get full coverage. The consistency is creamy and thick. It has a satin feel on the lips, with a true matte look. If you have dry lips, this will accentuate the dry patches therefore I suggest you apply a moisturizer on before this lipstick. I live in a highly humid and hot climate where I sweat a lot and this lipstick only lasts about 1-2 hours on before I have to reapply. It is a really nice consistency but I would not pay full price for it. I feel like I can get a comparable drugstore lipstick for a fraction of the cost."

The color runs cool and would in my opinion be best suited for cool tones. The pigmentation is great, it is very pigmented and covers the lips well. It has a thick consistency that isn\u2019t too overly drying, however it does accentuate dry patches on the lips. I would recommend applying a lip moisturizer prior to wearing this lipstick. I do find this lipstick to rub off easily and last up to 1-2 hours before needing to reapply. I live in south Texas where it is hot and humid therefore that may be a factor in the short longevity of this lip product. I do like the packaging and how well made and luxurious it is. Overall I think this is a good lipstick to wear if you want a creamy matte look, however I would not pay full price for it. I feel like you could find comparable and longer lasting lipsticks at the drugstore for a fraction of the price."

I was able To stick a make up brush inside the lid and apply it with the brush. I love the fact that it has a matte finish, but does not have the dry look that a lot of Matt lipsticks tend to have. I do wish it didn\u2019t cost so much but you\u2019re paying for great quality. I don\u2019t think it should have broken so easily considering how much it cost though."

The gold tube with intricate details exudes elegance and sophistication, making it a beautiful addition to any makeup bag or vanity. Applying this lipstick feels like a special occasion every time.  What sets this lipstick apart is its unique velvet matte formula. It glides on smoothly, offering rich pigmentation with just one swipe. The texture is soft and creamy, yet it dries down to a comfortable matte finish that doesn\u2019t feel drying or heavy on the lips. It strikes the perfect balance, providing the classic matte look without compromising on comfort.  The staying power is impressive as well. I found that it lasted through meals and drinks with minimal touch-ups needed. The colors remain vibrant and true throughout the day, which is a huge plus.  The color range is versatile, offering everything from bold reds to soft nudes, ensuring there's a shade for every occasion and skin tone. Each shade is beautifully pigmented and delivers a luxurious, velvety finish.  Another lovely touch is the subtle fragrance. It has a light, pleasant scent that enhances the overall luxurious experience without being overpowering.  Overall, the Gucci Velvet Matte Lipstick is a standout product that combines elegance, comfort, and long-lasting wear. It's a fantastic choice for anyone looking to add a touch of luxury to their makeup routine. Highly recommended for those who appreciate both beauty and performance in a lipstick."

I have also paired this with a nude lipstick to create an ombr\e effect and that is so beautiful for a summer vibe. I also adore the formula which is a velvet creamy matte vs a flat dry matte.

Not entirely - the matte lipstick goes on smoothly and doesn't have a chemical smell or taste and it doesn't feel tacky or sticky. It delivers on being matte and being the shade that the tube looks like - a very neutral lavender/beige that just doesn't suit my skintone. It only took one cup of coffee for it to start wearing off and that would be my main reason for not wanting to purchase another one, albeit even if it was in a color that was better meant for my coloring. I just don't prefer lip products that don't have a little more longevity. Re-applying several times during the day just isn't for me. What IS for me is receiving amazing cosmetics like this Gucci lipstick from Influenster complimentary in exchange for what is my honest review."

The pigmentation is also impressive, with a rich, even color that looks great on its own or paired with other products.   But what truly sets this lipstick apart is its incredible formula. Despite being a matte, it glides on effortlessly, with no dragging or tugging on the lips. The texture is surprisingly soft and buttery, making it a joy to apply.   This lipstick also has great wearing power and pretty much stays put and intact even after eating or drinking. There is extremely minimal transfer.   The applicator tube is also a beautiful, gold color and classy looking.    My tips for this product is to make sure your lips are well-moisturized and exfoliated before applying, as this will help the lipstick go on smoothly and evenly. Additionally, applying a lip liner first can create a beautifully defined line or border if that's your style. And if you're feeling extra fancy, this lipstick makes an amazing base for adding a lip gloss on top. I posted a photo with and without lip gloss added on top. The possibilities are endless!   Overall, I am impressed with this Gucci lipstick and would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a high-quality, long-lasting matte shade that's easy to apply and looks fabulous!"

I tried it on right away and formed some very thoughtful ideas about it! The first thing that I noticed, after noting the shade of it, was that it was very lightweight and not heavy at all. Even more so though, was that even though it was lightweight, it was very pigmented! The color was perfect for me, as I don\u2019t wear reds or pinks usually. I loved that it was a more nude tone and natural shade. Gliding smoothly across both my top and bottom lip, it felt rich and creamy, yet still not heavy at all.     Since I always research my make up products before I use them, I found that the Gucci Velvet Matte Lipstick was free of phthalates, sulfates, and parabens! Using a product which is more natural is important to me and the Gucci Velvet Matte Lipstick did not disappoint me! After wearing it for several hours I didn\u2019t notice any smudges or dryness to my lips. And did I mention the packaging? The packaging was simple, yet elegant. It comes in a gold tone tube and has vertical grooving all the way around it. I would highly recommend the Gucci Velvet Matte Lipstick in Suzanne Sunset if you enjoy wearing a creamy, smudge-proof matte lipstick in a more nude shade that embodies elegant packaging."

Gelling clay ensures smooth application, making it easy to achieve a flawless look. The lightweight formula stays put without running, and the color remains vibrant all day. This lipstick is a perfect blend of luxury and performance."

It is a dark orange red, like a terracotta red. I paired it with a red lipliner and thought it went well together. Unlike what it says on the product page, it can be very drying on the lips and it does smear if not properly set with liner or powder on top. I didn\u2019t notice the dryness as much when I was wearing it but when I removed it. Even wearing a lip balm underneath didn\u2019t help improve it very much.  I would definitely consider buying the satin version of this just wish this one was more hydrating as stated."

At first glance in the tube I thought they would be too dark (I usually wear light nudes) but instead they are just bright.  I never get compliments on my lipstick but with these I have received several compliments from strangers and think it is due to the bright matte that is very on trend at the moment.  The packaging is luxe and what you would expect from Gucci.  The actual formula is a little different, as many have commented it is VERY chalky (why I have 4 stars) so will need to apply a few coats and even then it is still quite chalky up close but from a distance it is a beautiful saturated colour on the lips.  It is quite long lasting and doesn't change your lip colour as it is fading like some other lipsticks.  It is on the dry side which is expected with a matte lipsticks but not super uncomfortable.  I am so glad I had the opportunity to get them at a reduced price to try them out but would not pay full price for them."

Gucci is my favorite to use hands down, because of the versatile pigmentation formula (can be a subtle stain or a full on party), buttery-smooth application and feel on the lips (not drying), longevity (with a universal lip liner), and the scent. The entire experience is luxurious, start to finish."

On me, it wears like a deep grape with just a hint of red - I don't think I've ever tried a colour quite like this before. Like all the other reviews have stated, it's incredible that this is a matte formula, because it glides on with the smooth easy consistency of the cushiest velvet finish, even on my dry winter lips.

Pros: non-drying, truly matte, long-wear, doesn't feather, can be blotted out, applies like butter (so soft), beautiful packaging, long-lasting, subtle sugared violet scent  Cons: cost  I love this formula. I use a liner for crisp lines, or blot out for a diffused look. It's the best non-drying matte I've found and this red is my ideal (comparable to MAC Russian Red). It still looks good 6hrs later, and even holds up pretty well with coffee and light snacking. For the cost, I could get a more affordable product but I love this formula so much and lipsticks last forever... I'll definitely rebuy when I run out.  The scent is the Gucci signature, sugared violet, and it reminds me of Parma Violet candies. It's subtle and I like it, but I understand why some people who are sensitive to fragrance might not. For me the scent fades quickly."

No weird flaking or gathering into cracks on my lips, and not drying at all. It sets down and stays (though I reapply after eating). The smell does not bother me, it\u2019s faint. I was worried about this.   I did see the other reviews where the bullet came out of the component and I will say mine seems a little loose. I\u2019m trying to only push the lipstick up as little as I need when I\u2019m applying and treating it very delicately. Gucci beauty has got some quality control to do in this regard."

The color selection is also super interesting, I really am loving Gucci lipsticks, the colors are so interesting and slightly different.   They do have a bit of a smell, but I cant smell it as much with the matte as with the satin or worse the sheer lipsticks. But honestly I have grown to like it. And the packaging is spectacular. Its a well done luxury product I enjoy using. Cant wait to see what other colors they come up  with and please bring back Louise Orange 307 in matte it was so beautiful.   I used to be obsessed with the satin and sheer line, but now I see the matte line is really what its all about. So pigmented and comfortable and beautiful. Wears great as a stain on its own, topped with a gloss, a balm, or worn more opaquely as a strong lip. Very versatile product."

I don\u2019t say this lightly and normally can\u2019t wear mattes as they are too drying and actually make my 62 year old mouth look more wrinkled BUT not this formula. One stroke and that\u2019s it and it lasts. I\u2019m a blue red or dark pink girl and have the following colors Cassie Magenta, Three Wise Girls, Eadie Scarlet, Love Before Breakfast. I also purchased the satin formula as well for when I want a little shine.   One word of advise if you have a problem with matte lipsticks - there is nothing like Algenist Liquid Lip Collagen to prevent lips from drying, cracking, and truly plumps while creating a smooth base once dried. I did purchase all of the above myself. I live in hot dry Arizona and cannot live without the Algenist Lip Collagen."

And in photos, this color looks great!   For a matte it's incredibly fluid. Like, it moves on my lips like a cream but stays matte. I drank juice from a can, ate a slice of pizza and this shade was still hanging strong!   It has a floral scent if that matters to you. It smells luxurious to me, and I don't mind it. I'm definitely going to be purchasing more shades!"

I tried the Gucci Rouge \u00e0 L\evres Mat Lipstick in 201 The Painted Veil and I\u2019m not going to lie, this has to be one of the most comfortable matte lipsticks I\u2019ve ever tried. It really does deliver the velvety feel it claims to.  It\u2019s somewhat transfer proof (tested this by kissing the top of my hand), but it doesn\u2019t claim not to be. I could still feel it on my lips after 3 tests.  This is a lipstick that won\u2019t last as long as a liquid lip, so if you want the full pigmented color you first apply, it\u2019s definitely one you should throw in your purse or bag to reapply throughout the day!  When it comes to if I would recommend it, I would say to those who can afford a $42 lipstick and want to experience Gucci makeup, go for it! But I would also say, don\u2019t feel the need to break the bank as there are definitely other lipsticks out there that can be a dupe for this!"

I\u2019ve never purchased from Gucci Beauty because of the price tag to be honest, but the packaging feels very luxurious. Pros: beautiful color, creamy, soft, comfortable wear, lux packaging, staying power is okay although it seems to bleed/transfer to my mug.

I did notice that it bleeds easily onto the straw/paper cup/plastic cup of my beverage of choice. Pro tip: Make sure to blot your lips of any excess color that may bleed!   There's also a heavy fragrance in this lipstick, that's a bit unbearable to me when I'm wearing a mask. BUT WHY WEAR LIPSTICK and a mask? Because I'm used to putting something on so I look pulled together and not dull without color on my face that's why. #complimentary #influenster #gucci #rougealevresmat I received this product complimentary for testing purposes."

If you play your cards right and apply it with enough time to set, it will only barely get on a mask too, so you can enjoy your lipstick for hours (I got around 5-6 hours out of mine with eating and drinking and mask wearing).   The color! This color is a beautiful pink, kind of nude but brighter. It\u2019s lovely on me (fair, cool toned).  Other than the price (#worthit), there is one drawback, which is the fragrance, Which is like an old lady\u2019s perfume. But it goes away quickly, thankfully.

One application and you can see some of your lips, had to apply two coats to get the right effect. I can imagine going through this very quickly. I am not a daily wearer but be advised if you are."

The casing is beautiful yet subtle. The tube feels heavy and luxurious, like you know you bought an expensive, valuable lipstick. This shade, Goldie Red, is killer. The bright red color is vibrant, deeply pigmented and gorgeous. This lipstick doesn't not bleed nor does it transfer.   What is equally impressive is that this matte lipstick is not trying and actually feels like it provides some hydration. I wore this lipstick for 8 hours, eating and drinking and had to use a makeup wipe to get it off, it is bullet proof. Very impressed with this formula as well. Well worth the price for timeless beauty and quality formula!"

I also didn\u2019t really like shade 201: The Painted Veil against my skintone, so I wouldn\u2019t wear it confidently without a brown lip liner. Would I recommend the formula? Definitely!

Man that was the best decision of my life (the lipstick not the breakup although that wasn\u2019t bad either) it arrives the night before what would have been our anniversary. It\u2019s like the Gucci gods want me to have a good day anyways. This lipstick has not failed me. The way it glides onto your lips will make you choose to wear this lipstick instead of kissing another person. The package is so sleek and gives me total vintage vibes which I\u2019m into. Normally I would expect a color like this to fade, and it does after a little wear but nothing even close to the tragic lipstick fade that I was expecting. So in conclusion break up with your boyfriend and kiss this lipstick instead of him."

Having said that, this lipstick is wonderful! Beautiful, weighted tube and many variations of color. This is a matte color which means your lips should be well moisturized and exfoliated or else flaky lips could shine through. This lipstick (I have Carol beige) lasts until eating where it wears away uniformly. I layer it with MAC stone lip liner and sometimes use this color as an accent on the middle of the lip to highlight. This product feels luxe and I have enjoyed using it. I did receive this complementary for reviewing purposes but that does not sway my review in any way. I take my cosmetics very seriously. Try it and if you don't like it, return it."

First for the price point that this is offered at, the color payoff was difficult to achieve. I had to apply 4x on upper and lower lips for it to be a smooth, opaque coverage. Second, the rose smell is overwhelming. I did not expect the product to have a smell, but it does and it lasted for at least 20mins on my lips. I highly dislike the smell of Rose's, when it comes to cosmetics, so I had to take the product off since I was getting a migraine after 20 mins of wear time. Finally, for the lipstick to have the name goldie rose, I thought it would be have red with a golden undertone on my lip, but alas, it was more orange than anything and made me look washed out. If you love, and I mean love the smell of rose cosmetics, try this product, it comes in many shades, but i will not be buying this in the future."

Usually when I wear matte lipstick, I add just a tiny bit of lip balm underneath to keep my lips from feeling dry; you cannot do that with this lipstick. the lipstick ended up getting goopy and running off my lips! it did apply much better without any bit of lip balm, but it made my lips feel tight and dry. For me, this lipstick is a miss, but if you can tolerate matte lipsticks without any under layer this may be a go-to for you!   I received this product complimentary from Gucci and Influenster in exchange for a review, however, my opinions are my own."

It reminds me of the beautiful packaging vintage makeup used to have. The lipstick applies like a creme and glides on effortlessly. The shade Carol Beige is a very light nude but doesnt give me the dreaded concealer lip look. It wears nicely, doesnt feel dry, and feels like I have nothing on my lips. The information in the box says it can also be worn on the eyes or cheeks which I haven't tried yet, but am curious to try to use it every way I can! I'm definitely going to try out other shades!"

Making sure to do all the proper makeup prep steps my lipstick ended up lasting me almost the entire day. I had to touch up once however that was mostly due to me getting sticky caramel on my bottom lip. Oops. My only issue was the color. I\u2019m fair skinned and this beige was a bit too light for me. It washed me out and just did not look right on me. I plan to try and purchase a mauve or dusty rose color for myself whenever I can. Makeup Mallory gives this lipstick 10 out of 10 kittykisses!

The color I received is a very light nude, i am very pale and the color still kind of looks like an off colored concealer on my lips unfortunately, with that being said I don't think it could be a shade for anyone to wear on its own honestly. I'm going to try it again with a darker lip liner or maybe in the center of another lip shade to create on ombre effect. I gave this 3 stars because the main issue i had with this product is that it gives me butt hole lips I think because the product has so many emolients and is so creamy it just doesn't want to cover my whole bottom lip and butt hole lips is never cute and even if I chose a different shade I don't think it would make a difference. The other reason I marked it so low is the color itself/its undertone itself is gonna be hard for anyone to wear."

It take a little while to fully dry, but once it dries it has definite staying powder. I absolutely love the formula. The one star off is just for the color. Honestly red is not my favorite and if choose to do a red, I prefer a darker, cooler red tone. This is a bit much for me. I will definitely be checking out their other colors. I will also use it with a deeper red lip pencil and I think it will look great for a fancy make up night. The packaging is all gold! Definitely a beautiful, luxury packing Great job with this Gucci."

I love a good matte lip, but as someone who struggles with dry and cracked lips often, most dry my lips out even more, or accentuate the rough texture. This is the most moisturizing Matte lipstick I\u2019ve ever tried. It goes on so smooth and has a beautiful red color. Definitely need a lip liner, even if it\u2019s clear, to keep it from fanning around the edges, but I would splurge on this in a good nude as well."

The color I received Carol Beige looks much darker on screen than in person. The color is almost leaning towards a chalky grayish color, like taupe. There isn\u2019t even a hint of coral here. I decided to line my lips with a cafe pencil, add a pinkish dark nude on the outter most part of my lips then add this lipstick to the middle for dimension. It wasn\u2019t a bad but but not a favorite. It takes more blending and manipulation than I find reasonable to make this look good on brown skin, but I suspect the warm red would look amazing on me. The gold packaging is beautiful and looks and feels like luxury; its of great quality (not the usual plastic feel). The lipstick has a heavy fragrance. It\u2019s a pretty scent but it\u2019s heavy enough to bother me after a few hours. Speaking of hours, I wanted to give this lipstick a proper full day wear test but I need to figure out a game plan because it\u2019s quite drying. It\u2019s not a matte that allows you to forget its there, however, I plan to give it another try because I\u2019d like to see how long it lasts and if it can hold up against dinner this weekend."
