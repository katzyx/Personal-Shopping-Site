But.. no matter how I put them in there, the attachments fall out all over the place. I would not have spent so much if I knew this prior. Decent case, not worth the $ amount imo."

It's so much easier sorting everything in once place , I got my dryer from costco, and it came with all the extra attachments, and this has the perfect amount of space to hold it all, it was definitely worth the wait cause it's been out of stock for so long lol"
