I have very dry skin especially in the winter, so it's hard to find something that doesn't cling to my dry patches, especially when looking for fuller coverage. This really seems to cover all the bases! Coverage is fantastic (and controllable if you want lighter/heavier) and I haven't had many issues with dry patches. On days where I am particularly dry, I will mix in a tiny bit of moisturizer with the foundation and this works perfectly. The color match is spot on for me too, but the shades definitely pull warm, orange, and darku2014never in my life have I referred to myself as being super  pale with rosey undertones lol, so keep that in mind when swatching. If you are very cool-toned and/or very pale, you might not be able to get a good color match.  Only cons are that if I'm not careful with application, it can 1) look cakey in certain areas, and 2) enhance certain lines, but both are only noticeable if I learn very close to the mirror. This may also be a concealer issue and not the foundation, still figuring it out."

I have tried many foundations from different price ranges and this comes out on top because it just makes you feel beautiful (coverage, finish, how it wears, colour match) like you have a filter on, and any tiredness or dullness becomes nonexistent even in environments like work bathrooms! It also plays well with problem skin related to dryness - flakes, texture, redness, sensitivity. I have had some very severe skin conditions and I am always confident that I won't get a reaction from this and it will make my skin look smoother after it's on, instead of emphasizing issues. I'm medium toned with redness and Light Beige is yellow enough to cancel out redness but not look unnatural, I do find the shades run a bit darker than they seem like they would based on the shade name compared to other brands. It is a true satin finish and I would say can easily be full coverage. I prefer a no makeup look, but I use this lightly with a damp beauty blender rather than trying to find another foundation and it doesn't look or feel heavy. Highly recommend!"

Iu2019m normally a light-medium neutral in most foundations, so I do think the shade names/description is quite far off since warm nude is a pretty good match for me (a tad bit yellow) and is described as u201cvery lightu201d. Nevertheless, a great foundation, natural finish, not heavy on the skin and doesnu2019t sit in fine lines or dry patches, it also doesnu2019t flashback with flash photography and find works well with most concealers."

This is most likely due to my skin type (dry/ sensitive) which doesn't do well with matte foundation, but there's not a lot of foundation out there for super pale people so I had to give it a try.  Pros -The color when first applied is spot on.  Cons - It has an oxidation issue (i.e. it changes colors in the bottle and on your face. - The foundation has a very chalky finish, not the traditional matte. - It doesn't play well with other products. For example, I have to pile on the blush because the foundation seems to absorb it.  After using this foundation for a while, I've decided I won't purchase it again for the reasons listed above."
