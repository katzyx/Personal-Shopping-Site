You shouldnu2019t have to take on the role of an FBI agent to discover whether or not a product you have used perfectly fine in the past has now recently caused atopic dermatitis around your eyelids. I do not understand why there is no transparency regarding these dangerous changes that potentially harm the consumer. Fine print, subtle packaging changes and whispers of reformulation are NOT acceptable modes of communicating to the consumer the ingredients have been changed especially when the ingredients added are known irritants. ALL reformulation should be highlighted in big dark bolded font as you do so with the ornamented images, price, beneficial ingredients, and positive marketing of the product. Companies will always maximize profits at the cost of the consumer but to maximize it at the cost of our health? Something should be done, shame on Sephora and shame on belief."

This soothing tip is a much more hygienic way of applying anything near the eyes and it allows for just the right amount of product with minimal waste. The caffeine immediately decreased the appearance of puffiness and bags around my lids. I loved the lightweight feel of the hyaluronic acid to moisturize. It absorbed so quickly and I am excited to use this longer term to see the benefits of Vitamin C and Niacinamide for my dark spots and crows feet."

This cream feels fresh and moisturizing, I usually use it at night and I can notice that the skin continues to hydrate in the morning and as for the expression lines of my eyes I still don't have expected results but this is a process of perseverance . I am happy so far and it is definitely an eye contour cream that I recommend if you are looking for hydration, light weight and moisture in your routine."

This eye cream is designed to provide intense hydration, reduce puffiness, and soften the appearance of fine lines, making it an ideal addition to your skincare routine.  The lightweight formula is one of the standout features of this product. It feels airy and absorbs quickly without leaving a greasy or sticky residue, which is a significant advantage for an eye cream. After applying it, the skin around the eyes feels refreshed and instantly moisturized, creating a smooth canvas for makeup or just a natural look.  Belif Moisturizing Eye Bomb Cream is infused with a blend of nourishing ingredients, including comfrey leaf and pennywort extract, which are known for their hydrating and soothing properties. This combination helps to reduce puffiness and restore a bright, awake appearance to tired eyes.  Another notable aspect is the longevity of hydration. The Eye Bomb Cream provides moisture that lasts throughout the day, keeping the eye area feeling comfortable and soft. This long-lasting effect is especially helpful for those who suffer from dryness or irritation around the eyes.  The scent is very subtle, almost undetectable, which is ideal for a product designed for sensitive skin areas. The packaging is practical, with a twist-off cap that keeps the cream fresh and easy to access. However, as with most jar-based eye creams, it's a good practice to use a clean spatula or your finger to maintain hygiene.  Overall, Belif Moisturizing Eye Bomb Cream is a high-quality eye cream that delivers on its promises of hydration, puffiness reduction, and smoothing fine lines. Its lightweight texture, soothing ingredients, and long-lasting hydration make it an excellent choice for anyone looking to enhance their eye care routine. If you're seeking a product that refreshes and rejuvenates the eye area without feeling heavy, this Eye Bomb Cream is worth considering."

Does this mean that itu2019s not going to work for someone else? No. This may not be the right product for me. It probably doesnu2019t help that sleep is random these days because I have a teething baby so my face is all kinds of lost these days. The cream feels refreshing, light, and non-greasy.

The squalene and ceramides seem to rejuvenate my under eyes, making my fine lines and wrinkles a bit less visible, while the touch of caffeine helps to reduce any dark circles that I may have.  My only gripe is that in my opinion, eye creams do not need any fragrance, and this eye cream has a few different essential oils as fragrance. I don't necessarily like putting products with any fragrance near my eyes, but I found this to be no problem for me."

Created to be a lightweight formula that moisturizes & firms your eye area.  Designed to target three areas of your eye: eye bags, crowu2019s feet, & eyelids. Key ingredients: peptide, ceramide, & squalane. Clinically tested to retain your skinu2019s moisture for up to 48 hrs.   ud83dudca7My experience: For reference, I have genetically inherited dark, puffy under eye circles. While no eye cream is ever going to fix my dark circles I do try to take care of my eye area. This is a nice, lightweight pale blue gel cream. It has a subtle fresh & clean scent but is not strong at all. This is a very moisturizing eye cream. Despite having combo to oily skin my under eye area absorbs this eye cream without feeling greasy or oily. I do notice that the skin around my puffy under eyes appears to be tighter. It will be interesting to see if this effect is more permanent with further long term use. I also notice that the skin under my eyes appears a little brighter with a hint of a shine to it. Iu2019m quite pleased with the results thus far.   ud83dudca7Overall: Iu2019m enjoying this new Belief Eye bomb. The skin around my eyes are nicely moisturized, appears tighter, & brighter. I am curious to see results after long term use. Thus far I give it a 5.0/5.0"

After just a few uses my eyes look moisturized, hydrated, and the wrinkles around my eyes are less noticeable. Iu2019ll be purchasing this product in the near future."

It has a smooth and creamy texture that feels luxurious when applying it to the delicate skin around the eyes. It absorbs quickly and does not leave any greasy residue or make my skin feel heavy.  I have noticed that this eye cream has helped to reduce the appearance of fine lines and puffiness under my eyes. It also makes my eye area feel hydrated and refreshed. I have used it both in the morning and at night, and it provides a nice base for my makeup during the day.  One thing that I appreciate about this eye cream is that it does not irritate my sensitive skin. This one has been gentle and soothing.  The packaging of the eye cream is also convenient. I find that a little goes a long way, so it should last me a decent amount of time.  The only downside I would mention about this eye cream is the price. It is on the higher end compared to some other options on the market. However, considering the quality of the product and the noticeable results I have seen, I believe it is worth the investment.  Overall, I would highly recommend this eye cream to anyone looking for a hydrating and effective solution for fine lines and general eye rejuvenation. It has become a staple in my skincare routine, and I will continue to repurchase it in the future."

With Peptide, Ceramide, and Squalane, it not only provides intense hydration but also visibly firms and reduces the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles. It's like a mini spa treatment for your eyes! One thing I love about the belif Eye Bomb is that it's clinically tested to retain moisture for up to 48 hours. That's impressive! It means you can enjoy long-lasting hydration without having to constantly reapply. Another great feature is that it targets three key areas: eye bags, crow's feet, and eyelids. It's like a triple threat against those pesky signs of aging! Overall, I'm really excited to give the belif Eye Bomb a try and see the results for myself. The positive reviews I've read only add to my anticipation. I'll definitely update this review once I've had a chance to experience the magic firsthand. If you're looking for an eye cream that delivers hydration, firmness, and visible reduction in fine lines and wrinkles, I highly recommend giving the belif Eye Bomb a shot. Your eyes will thank you!"

The scent is mild and unobtrusive, which is a plus for those sensitive to fragrances in skincare products.  In terms of reducing fine lines or dark circles, the results vary.
