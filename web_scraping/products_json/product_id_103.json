You shouldnt have to take on the role of an FBI agent to discover whether or not a product you have used perfectly fine in the past has now recently caused atopic dermatitis around your eyelids. I do not understand why there is no transparency regarding these dangerous changes that potentially harm the consumer. Fine print, subtle packaging changes and whispers of reformulation are NOT acceptable modes of communicating to the consumer the ingredients have been changed especially when the ingredients added are known irritants. ALL reformulation should be highlighted in big dark bolded font as you do so with the ornamented images, price, beneficial ingredients, and positive marketing of the product. Companies will always maximize profits at the cost of the consumer but to maximize it at the cost of our health? Something should be done, shame on Sephora and shame on belief."

Waking up to eyes that were still half shut in appearance, the cool ceramic applicator was so calming and I greatly appreciated the fact that I didnt have to dip my fingers into a pot to apply. This soothing tip is a much more hygienic way of applying anything near the eyes and it allows for just the right amount of product with minimal waste. The caffeine immediately decreased the appearance of puffiness and bags around my lids. I loved the lightweight feel of the hyaluronic acid to moisturize. It absorbed so quickly and I am excited to use this longer term to see the benefits of Vitamin C and Niacinamide for my dark spots and crows feet."

This cream feels fresh and moisturizing, I usually use it at night and I can notice that the skin continues to hydrate in the morning and as for the expression lines of my eyes I still don't have expected results but this is a process of perseverance . I am happy so far and it is definitely an eye contour cream that I recommend if you are looking for hydration, light weight and moisture in your routine."

This eye cream is designed to provide intense hydration, reduce puffiness, and soften the appearance of fine lines, making it an ideal addition to your skincare routine.  The lightweight formula is one of the standout features of this product. It feels airy and absorbs quickly without leaving a greasy or sticky residue, which is a significant advantage for an eye cream. After applying it, the skin around the eyes feels refreshed and instantly moisturized, creating a smooth canvas for makeup or just a natural look.  Belif Moisturizing Eye Bomb Cream is infused with a blend of nourishing ingredients, including comfrey leaf and pennywort extract, which are known for their hydrating and soothing properties. This combination helps to reduce puffiness and restore a bright, awake appearance to tired eyes.  Another notable aspect is the longevity of hydration. The Eye Bomb Cream provides moisture that lasts throughout the day, keeping the eye area feeling comfortable and soft. This long-lasting effect is especially helpful for those who suffer from dryness or irritation around the eyes.  The scent is very subtle, almost undetectable, which is ideal for a product designed for sensitive skin areas. The packaging is practical, with a twist-off cap that keeps the cream fresh and easy to access. However, as with most jar-based eye creams, it's a good practice to use a clean spatula or your finger to maintain hygiene.  Overall, Belif Moisturizing Eye Bomb Cream is a high-quality eye cream that delivers on its promises of hydration, puffiness reduction, and smoothing fine lines. Its lightweight texture, soothing ingredients, and long-lasting hydration make it an excellent choice for anyone looking to enhance their eye care routine. If you're seeking a product that refreshes and rejuvenates the eye area without feeling heavy, this Eye Bomb Cream is worth considering."

Under my eyes definitely feel moisturized, which is accurate according to one of the products claims. I did not notice any firming or reduction in fine lines around my eyes personally. Does this mean that its not going to work for someone else? No. This may not be the right product for me. It probably doesnt help that sleep is random these days because I have a teething baby so my face is all kinds of lost these days. The cream feels refreshing, light, and non-greasy. I always find that a plus because nobody wants heavy, greasy anything on their face. I would recommend this for the moisturizing portion for sure! But not for the wrinkle and firming part."

Overall I think this product could work for someone without watery eyes. I did like the way it made my skin feel, very hydrated for at least 24 hours.

Created to be a lightweight formula that moisturizes & firms your eye area.  Designed to target three areas of your eye: eye bags, crows feet, & eyelids. Key ingredients: peptide, ceramide, & squalane. Clinically tested to retain your skins moisture for up to 48 hrs.   ud83dudca7My experience: For reference, I have genetically inherited dark, puffy under eye circles. While no eye cream is ever going to fix my dark circles I do try to take care of my eye area. This is a nice, lightweight pale blue gel cream. It has a subtle fresh & clean scent but is not strong at all. This is a very moisturizing eye cream. Despite having combo to oily skin my under eye area absorbs this eye cream without feeling greasy or oily. I do notice that the skin around my puffy under eyes appears to be tighter. It will be interesting to see if this effect is more permanent with further long term use. I also notice that the skin under my eyes appears a little brighter with a hint of a shine to it. Im quite pleased with the results thus far.   ud83dudca7Overall: Im enjoying this new Belief Eye bomb. The skin around my eyes are nicely moisturized, appears tighter, & brighter. I am curious to see results after long term use. Thus far I give it a 5.0/5.0"

I live in a very dry climate with very little humidity so I needed a product that would complement my diet and amount of water I drink to make up for the lack of moisture. I had a rash from being so dry and this product literally cleared it up in just a few days. I used it once in the morning and once before bed every day for two weeks. I like the little amount of scent that it has. It absorbs very quick. My eyes look great and I feel pampered!!"

Additionally, it adheres to ethical standards since it doesn't contain any animal testing or harmful ingredients.

Belief Moisturizing Eye Bomb, and I have been using it for the past few days.  Overall, I am quite impressed with this eye cream. It has a smooth and creamy texture that feels luxurious when applying it to the delicate skin around the eyes. It absorbs quickly and does not leave any greasy residue or make my skin feel heavy.  I have noticed that this eye cream has helped to reduce the appearance of fine lines and puffiness under my eyes. It also makes my eye area feel hydrated and refreshed. I have used it both in the morning and at night, and it provides a nice base for my makeup during the day.  One thing that I appreciate about this eye cream is that it does not irritate my sensitive skin. This one has been gentle and soothing.  The packaging of the eye cream is also convenient. I find that a little goes a long way, so it should last me a decent amount of time.  The only downside I would mention about this eye cream is the price. It is on the higher end compared to some other options on the market. However, considering the quality of the product and the noticeable results I have seen, I believe it is worth the investment.  Overall, I would highly recommend this eye cream to anyone looking for a hydrating and effective solution for fine lines and general eye rejuvenation. It has become a staple in my skincare routine, and I will continue to repurchase it in the future."

With Peptide, Ceramide, and Squalane, it not only provides intense hydration but also visibly firms and reduces the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles. It's like a mini spa treatment for your eyes! One thing I love about the belif Eye Bomb is that it's clinically tested to retain moisture for up to 48 hours. That's impressive! It means you can enjoy long-lasting hydration without having to constantly reapply. Another great feature is that it targets three key areas: eye bags, crow's feet, and eyelids. It's like a triple threat against those pesky signs of aging! Overall, I'm really excited to give the belif Eye Bomb a try and see the results for myself. The positive reviews I've read only add to my anticipation. I'll definitely update this review once I've had a chance to experience the magic firsthand. If you're looking for an eye cream that delivers hydration, firmness, and visible reduction in fine lines and wrinkles, I highly recommend giving the belif Eye Bomb a shot. Your eyes will thank you!"

However, it's important to note that some users have reported irritation or drying effects, so it might not be suitable for all skin types. The scent is mild and unobtrusive, which is a plus for those sensitive to fragrances in skincare products.  In terms of reducing fine lines or dark circles, the results vary. While I haven't seen a dramatic change in these areas, the overall hydration has definitely improved the appearance of my under-eye skin"

This soft, lightweight eye cream helps smooth fine lines with 26-hours of intense moisture, while visibly boosting elasticity and increasing skin resilience under my eyes. Moreover, blended with Belifs signature Napier's Original and Moisture Formula, this rich eye cream floods the skin under my eyes with intense moisture for radiant and youthful-looking skin. Also, this eye cream delivers supple and moisturized skin under my eyes, and preps it for a smooth crease-free makeup application.  I have already recommended the LG Beauty Belif Eye Bomb to many of my friends and family and several of them have already purchased and used this hydrating moisturizer and are absolutely happy to see the results, as this eye cream visibly boosts elasticity and increases skin resilience under their eyes, as well as floods the skin under their eyes with intense moisture for radiant and youthful-looking skin around their eye area."
