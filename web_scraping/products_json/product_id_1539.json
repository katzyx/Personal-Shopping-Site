Since using this product and Sulwhasoo Oil Cleanser as my go-to Step 1 to clean skin, my skin texture has gotten much smoother.  Following up with a good face routine (toner, serum, creams, sunscreen) my skin has been looking much healthier where I'm finding myself being more comfortable having makeup free days.  I'd also like to point out that I live in Hawaii and the weather although beautiful, it's very harsh on the skin.  Living in California I rarely had blemishes and my skin was very manageable without the need to double cleanse, use toner and serums."

I used my points to purchase a set with this cleanser and other sulwhasoo products. I have used this cleanser for the past week. I intentionally only used this cleanser to see how it performs. I love how much this cleanser foams and I love how gentle this cleanser is. I agree with the claims of the cleanser. It is so gentle, but my skin feels so clean after using it. I even let my 70 year old mom use it (she has shingles on her face and her skin is very sensitive). She loved the cleanser so much she put it in her skincare drawer and I had to get it back lol. It has a pleasant citrusy, orange/grapefruite scent that I love. I can see me purchasing the full size once the small size I have runs out. I donu2019t see a difference in other benefits such as wrinkles, pores, or brightening but it also never made any claims to improve this. If you are looking for a great cleanser that lathers, deep cleanses, softens, but is very gentle, you would love this!"

I love how it foams up and feels like it offers a great deep clean. It also has a wonderful but gentle balsam/pine scent that is quite relaxing when winding down in the evening."

To the people attacking the brand for the u201cnewu201d add of fragrance and the impact on health: sorry to burst the Hate Bandwagon bubble but there was added fragrance in the ingredients as far back as 2013. If you praised it then, the new formulation should not be an issue for you UNLESS itu2019s the actual scent itself. This product is lovely, Iu2019ve used a full bottle and will rebuy. I love the scent it reminds me of Bal Du2019Afrique. It cleanses thoroughly but doesnu2019t leave skin tight. Itu2019s moisturizing without leaving a film. It works with fingers, manual brushes, sponges, electronic brushes"

I personally have been loving this cleanser used as a stand alone product, but it works nicely as a second step in a double-cleansing routine as well. It's rich foam removes my makeup like magic and leaves my skin feeling soft and clean, and looking healthy and radiant. Cart worthy for sure!"

The light foam creates a rich lather and gently removes makeup, oily buildup, dirt and grime. Iu2019ve been using this twice daily as my regular cleanser and have been extremely pleased with how healthy and rejuvenated my skin looks and feels. Adding this to my skincare routine has made a noticeable difference in the overall softness and suppleness of my skin. It also has a light, botanical scent which I also find very refreshing."
