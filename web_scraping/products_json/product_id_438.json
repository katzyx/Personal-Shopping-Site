It is really hydrating but doesn't leave my skin oily or greasy at all. It soaks in nicely and doesn't have a bad scent to it. I even brought it on my vacation with me and I only ever bring products I love with me!"

This facial oil has become a staple in my skincare routine.   First off, the texture is incredibly light and non-greasy, which is perfect for my combination skin. It absorbs quickly, leaving my face feeling soft, smooth, and deeply hydrated. The blend of superfoods in this oil, like broccoli seed oil and flaxseed oil, really works wonders. My skin looks visibly brighter and more radiant.  I also appreciate the subtle, fresh scent u2013 it's not overpowering, just a pleasant hint of natural botanicals. Iu2019ve noticed a significant improvement in my skinu2019s overall texture and tone. It feels more balanced and nourished, and even some dry patches I used to struggle with are now gone.  Overall, Elmis Superfood Hydrating and Nourishing Facial Oil is a fantastic product that delivers on its promises. Itu2019s made a noticeable difference in my skinu2019s health and appearance, and I canu2019t recommend it enough!"

This one is very powerful and very concentrated. You only need about two drops and that is more than plenty to go on your entire face. It has a beautiful natural fragrance. And a super lightweight and non greasy. It absorbs into the skin super quickly. It minimizes the look of dullness and enhances skin radiance for a glowing complexion.Highly concentrated, it is formulated with a blend of 9 Superfood Oils including Broccoli, Rosehip, Flaxseed and Daikon Radish to feed the skin. My skin looks so youthful hydrated and even my tone looks better in the morning. Does facial oil is packed with nine nutrient-rich vitamins and antioxidants So very much like a superfood that you would take for your body but for your skin. When I use this in my night time routine, it feels like such a luxurious calming experience with the natural chamomile almost lavender-like fragrance. Very much spa-like!"

This luxurious oil is packed with a blend of powerful antioxidants, vitamins, and superfoods that leave my skin feeling nourished, hydrated, and radiant.   **Key Ingredients:** * Chlorella (a type of algae) to detoxify and soothe the skin * Rosehip oil to regenerate and improve skin texture * Green tea extract to protect against environmental stressors * Vitamin E to moisturize and nourish   **How it works:** I apply a few drops of the oil to my face and neck after cleansing and toning, and massage it in gently. The oil absorbs quickly, leaving no residue or greasiness behind. I can feel it working its magic as it deeply nourishes and hydrates my skin, leaving it feeling smooth and supple.   **Pros:** * Fast-absorbing and non-greasy formula * Leaves skin feeling soft, smooth, and hydrated * Rich in antioxidants and vitamins to combat signs of aging * Suitable for all skin types (even sensitive skin) **  Cons:** * A bit pricey (around $70 for 30ml) * Not suitable for acne-prone skin (due to some comedogenic ingredients)   **Overall:** The Elemis Superfood Facial Oil is a wonderful addition to my skincare routine. It's perfect for those looking for a luxurious, nourishing oil that delivers real results. While it may be on the pricier side, I believe it's worth the investment for the quality and effectiveness of the ingredients."

I incorporated this into my morning routine as the first skincare step after cleansing and I found it to layer really well with my other Elemis products and it sank in quickly without leaving a greasy residue. I noticed the biggest difference in my forehead since I have been dealing with some dehydration issues there. My fine lines were becoming more pronounced there because the skin was lacking moisture but after using this for a couple weeks my skin overall looks much better and has a glow. The difference is very noticeable and the feel of my skin is smooth rather than crepe-y. It gives an immediate glowy look which is great for summer months which are here now but it doesn't leave a greasy feeling behind. It's a lovely oil for those of us that don't always have the best of luck with oils."

It all because this facial oil absorbs seamlessly and speedy into the skin.  I used this oil regularly as my after shower skincare routine, every early evening. My skin felt deeply nourished and satisfied with the use of this oil. I have some redness on my face and I also got some flaking, all these caused by chronically dry skin. Those spots started diminishing over time with regular use. My skin also felt deeply and intensely hydrated & moisturized. I felt my skin elasticity getting better and didnu2019t feel the pull or tightening of my skin, which were caused by very dry skin. It helped firm my skin and my skinu2019s slight saggy areas noticeably got firmed.

Nice feel, not too heavy of an oil. No pilling.  I personally like using it mixed into moisturizer to condense steps in my routine. Helps with relieving dryness.  The scent is strong and reminds me of patchouli. I really think some folks will love how much of a scent experience it is.

Itu2019s lightweight, non-greasy, and absorbs quickly. I was concerned it might feel too heavy, but itu2019s actually very light and feels luxurious on my skin.

The flaxseed oil is incredibly soothing and does an excellent job of sealing in moisture, leaving my skin hydrated and improving its tone. The daikon radish oil absorbs quickly, providing deep nourishment without any greasy residue, which is a big plus for my combination skin. The broccoli seed oil, along with the other superfood oils in the blend, works to plump and smooth my skin, giving it a healthy, radiant glow.  I use the facial oil every morning after cleansing, as suggested, and only need three to four drops to cover my face and neck. The oil is light and non-greasy, making it perfect for daily use under makeup or on its own. I've noticed a significant improvement in my skin's hydration and overall appearance. It feels smoother, looks more radiant, and has a noticeable firmness.  Overall, the Elemis Facial Oil Spray is a luxurious, effective product that enhances my skin's health and radiance. I highly recommend it to anyone looking to boost their skincare routine with a powerful, nourishing facial oil."

It copes well with redness and peeling, does not clog pores, does not leave heaviness on the skin, and does not overload it. If necessary, you can apply your favorite cream on top of the oil. I like to add a drop of oil to serums and creams. Bottle volume 15 ml."

After a month of using Superfood Facila Oil, I have to say it make my face glow and healthy, I use it in the morning and it feels light and migrating, to be be honest it doesn'feel oily at all, sometimes I add it to my skintint to get a more natural glowy look, at high I use it with a guasha and my skin looks healthy.  It's great to add in your routine if you want to improve the health of your skin. I have very sensitive and dry skin (mid 30's) and had no irritation while using it, I think is good for oily skin because it doesn't feel heavy or sticky, it's very light.  I'll repurchaze it in the future, I highly recommend it, and I also recommend to try other products from Eleimis."

I have a love/hate relationship with facial oil, as they're either easy to dispense and leave my skin soft, or a drop and a half plus a night of sleep leaves me waking up, looking like I haven't showered in a month.  Additionally, my skin cannot tolerate green tea extract, and green usually equals extract.  So, I approached this with a side eye and heavy heart, knowing I at least had to TRY it for a review.  I must say, aside from my beloved Skin & Co. Truffle Therapy oil, this us now a solid #2 in my repertoire.  I go all out with my skincare routine (though I only use the oil in the evening): twice a day, it's wash/tone/spot treat/serum/moisturize (and this is at night, so I'm wearing a heavy moisturizer), and I'm happy to report that this one comes down on the love side if the scale.  It's easy to dispense, absorbs quickly and leaves my skin feeling like a baby's.  As long as I put my hair back for a minute to let it soak in, I don't get the weird, oily strings of hair in front like I do with a lot if oils.  It's good enough, that  Elemis is now on the list of must try brands once my skincare stash gets low.  If you're an oil user (and/or want the hydration but not loom like you slept under a leaky oil pan), do yourself a favor and give this a try."

Let me start by saying that the smell is fantastic, subtle and elegant; the consistency of the oil is perfect for easy distribution on the face and neck. The application instructions suggest using 3 or 4 drops, but the reality is that you need 6 drops for a full massage over the entire area. Massage for a few minutes... this step became my favorite; it's so enjoyable to start the day with this delightful aroma massage. Afterward, my skin is left with a spectacular glow, no greasy complexion or annoying shine. This oil gives you just the right touch of glow that will make your skin look healthy and full of life. I've been using the product for two weeks and I really saw improvements not only in the appearance of my skin but also felt improvements in firmness and softness. It improved the appearance of my pores, giving me smoother and more even skin. And sometimes I would get small pimples on my chin, since I started using this oil my skin is free of those imperfections. After two weeks of daily use, the bottle is still more than half full, so I estimate that the product should last about three or four months, so it's really worth paying for it. Without a doubt, I will make it a must-have in my skincare routine."

I ended up using a few droppers full but it still didnu2019t leave my skin feeling hydrated.

This oil has become a staple in my beauty routine, and I'd highly recommend this."

I wanted to love this so bad since I really love some other Elemis products on the market but my skin just did not agree with it. After every use the skin around my eyes would swell up. I didnu2019t apply it around my eyes, of course, but it still continued to happen only there, after each use. And I donu2019t have necessarily sensitive skin so I thought that was strange. The product consistency is just ok too. While it is an oil I feel like it dried so quickly, way before I was even able to disperse it around my skin. The scent is also really, really strong. I have no issues with fragrance but this one is just a little overpowering. Itu2019s a fresh scent, but not one I personally want smelling so strongly on my face. While I wanted to love it, itu2019s definitely not for me."
