I've never used a product this enriching and the results were almost immediate. I've had my jumbo container since FEBRUARY that I still use and love her to this day, and I only use it underneath makeup (so that I don't run out as quickly). A little goes a long way.  For reference, I have very dry skin (like the Sahara desert lol), and I only use water-based products for skin care and make up routine so that there is no improper mixing and pilling of products.  You can get different sizes for cheaper, which is also really nice. I will say the jumbo size is quite an investment, but she is SOOOOO worth it. Highly recommend for people with dry skin. Really works well under water based makeup."

I have to be very careful of over-exfoliation or my skin gets super red and raw, while still producing tons of oil. My morning skin prep used to be moisturizer + eye cream + sunscreen + Hourglass mineral veil primer + Urban Decay eye primer potion, the latter two being the only products I've ever found that helped me with makeup meltdown in any capacity. This product takes the place of moisturizer and both primers I previously used and I'd argue is an even better makeup base than before. Now, I start with eye cream, layer this all-over including eye area (there is also an eye version of this product but the face version works great so I don't see the point), and finish with a tinted SPF. I love how much it's simplified my routine but even better is how much more effective the new routine is.  For reference, my face is so oily I can solidly fill an entire blue blotting paper in about 1.5 hrs. With my old routine, eye makeup smudged constantly throughout the day and at 31 I'm sure I've prematurely created wrinkles rubbing this off constantly. With the new routine using this product, I'm about as oily but my eye makeup can go all day without smudging. All of my makeup actually lasts much longer with this product than before but I'm sososo impressed about the eye makeup I have to point that out. On top of that, I love the ingredients in this, like vitamin C, the texture, scent, how it goes on, etc. It's been a while since I've found a holy grail, must repurchase forever product but this is one."

I have very oily acne prone skin and buying this was a real leap of faith because the person who I originally heard about it from has ultra dry skin. But living in Alberta (especially now that it's winter) I wanted something a bit more nourishing since it's so dry here and I am shocked at how well it's been working for me. I usually know pretty quick if my skin is going to freak out at something and so far (it's been a week!) so good. I've been using this with the dr. jart cicapair on top and some laura mercier setting powder and it's the best my skin has looked in AGES. I use it as a daytime moisturizer, not a nighttime one though. Note: it does smell very citrussy so if you don't like that smell or if you're scent sensitive, you might want to avoid. For comparison, my summer routine is the origins matte moisturizer (in the pink container) with the biossance gel one over top."

I started with the travel size, so refill that and keep the big jar in the back of the fridge with parchment on it. It's always fresh! This is one of my never replace, will weep when it's discontinued, favorite ever parts of my routine. I have very dry (USED TO) skin and use a good whack of this every morning on face and neck and then rub the remainder into my hands. It has a real aroma, but as someone with very sensitive skin to perfumes it doesn't bother my skin and I love the way it smells. Clean, citrus and it dissipates almost immediately. I feel terrible for the folks this doesn't work for because I ran out TODAY and was just so mad at me for the few days I'm going to have to live without it."
