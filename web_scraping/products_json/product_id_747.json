Just from getting a small sample I knew it was worth the cash. this pack was way better then just getting the 30ml drops!! you get the tanning water AND the 30ml drops for $47. the 30ml drops are $43... so yeah this was an awesome deal!! it doesn't leave me orange. My hands are dark but thats my own fault for forgetting to wash my hands. I used the mitt that came with it which btw (is super cute!!). I use the mitt & my hands. I used the face drops for my body too.. you can do that. it's not just for your face. it works the same however you use it. I seen before for face & body but this says face so I use for both and it's fine. I mix them both, idgaf!! lol ud83dude06ud83eudee0 Anyways after one use I was pretty dark, I barely used Amy product, so little that it still looks brand new... so I can tell this is going to last for a decent amount of time. So it might not look like much but it spreads out to be alot. You'll notice that the morning after using it. You'll see that it's strong and you don't need much. anyways it has a bit of tan smell but nothing bad at all and goes away.  I'm obsessed. it doesn't wash off. it becomes your skin which I love. it doesn't feel like your coating your skin. it feels like nothing and I love that so much!!! so far so good and I have VERY sensitive skin. this is worth it ladies!!!  so I've been doing the saturn tanning bed and this stuff made me even darker then that did...... so yeah. I'm gonna use this to replace the $40 Saturn sessions. I'll do both but more of this! I'm obsessed of you can't tell... ud83eudd23ud83eudd70ud83dude18"

I do wish they created different tones (especially olive toned) formats, not just light to dark."

I am pretty pale so started with only a few drops in medium with my moisturizer and I barely noticed any results. Iu2019ve gone up to 9 drops and still not that dark, but I did find it even. I think Iu2019m mixing it with too much cream. Have to keep tweaking that. I tried the spray and used the mitt as directed, I found it very uneven. Also I noticed the sunspots/pigmentation on my face and legs became remarkably much more noticeable. Didnu2019t love that. I do love that it doesnu2019t stain clothes/bedding! Thatu2019s a huge plus as this is what has deterred me from trying tanners in the past. Also, it makes my skin feel softer.  Like I said Iu2019m new to the self tanning game, so it might be me!"

I didn't know what color to grab, and I didn't know exactly what the process was I simply tried to follow the instructions BUT, I took a bath and exfoliated and shaved to be sure I had even textures and I dried out of the shower and moisturised and applied the spray, now I was extremely let down and thought it wouldn't work... it took 12 hours to develop on freshly washed skin. the instructions did say to exfoliate 24 hours before. or it won't develop as fast in my experience, I did half of one leg to try and I was pretty sad after 6 ish hours I saw no change, I went to bed and woke up in the morning and man did it take. it needs alot of time. for the rest of the body when applying it, it's developed way faster. I have rinsed it off after 12 hours for the first test. and it's a nice warm glow it seemed a bit patchy but a nice rinse took care of it!! let this product do its thing and patience is key. I was ready to give up but the redness in my skin is gone and it's a nice and even texture all throughout!  10/10"

The spray is NOT even, and leaves the skin looking very spotted and blotchy, even after exfoliating very well. The oil sticks to hair by the eyebrows and makes them look uneven. I also found that it sticks to the side of the nose, typically where there is a bit more roughness/pores in the skin. It smells great, and it works good for the body, but most definetley not a favorite for my face. It caused me to break out pretty bad, and the mornings I woke up after applying it my skin felt extremely irritated and dry. This was however my skins reaction and may vary depending on the person, itu2019s a good product for the price and if it works for your skin I think itu2019s great! I did however have to bring it back after it made me start breaking out, very kind of the staff to take it back :)"

The tanning water and drops are both great for fair to light skin, and I notice some colour/glow after one application. The colour is a little on the golden side but still looks natural. There is a bit of a brown sugar/fresh self-tanner smell but I quite like it. The little body positivity book is cute too. My only complaint is the tanning mitt - as someone with small hands and short natural nails, it barely covers my wrist and only one side can actually be used for application. I would recommend this if you're looking for a face tanner serum and want a good deal, but would suggest buying a different tanning mitt to go along with things."
