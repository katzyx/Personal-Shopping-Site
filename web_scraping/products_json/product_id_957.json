Somehow this powder manages to dry my skin and makes my fine lines even more noticibke. Also, thereu2019s nothing translucent about it! It leaves a dull, white cast to the naked eye, no flash necessary. The worst part is this plastic,  chemical smell. The packaging is so cheap.

This is the absolute best of them in my opinion, but it's not a powder meant to add another layer of makeup for  additional coverage (as an example). It is smooth and light with a diffusing quality that blurs pores and small imperfections. It is mattifying, but not so much that it makes my dry skin look dryer or emphasizes any texture. Because I start with an illuminating sunscreen (Supergoop! Glowscreen for the win!) like to use it on my t-zone, on any puffiness under my eyes, and around my lips before lipstick. In fact, I like it so much that I bought a second one for my purse."

The powder came in a Translucent shade, which worked perfectly for my light skin tone. It has a light powdery clean scent that fades pretty quickly on my skin. It helps my makeup to stay longer and slow down skin oil production. It makes my skin feel soft and really smooth to the touch, but visually it doesn't really blur much, you need to apply a decent amount of product. My initial concern related to this was that the product could oxidize on my face by the end of the day, but it didn't happen. Overall, it's a nice pick if you would like to renew your layer of powder on the go, but for initial application at home, I would prefer a loose powder."

This is the beauty of the translucent shade, and just this formula. Itu2019s light, but perfects. Not heavy, but creates a flawless look. Versatile in that I can apply it with a brush or sponge, and lasts. I have applied it to my lids, which is highly recommended under shadow for a nice smooth application/staying power, or over a u201cnakedu201d lid, color corrected with some concealer. Where is really u201cshinesu201d is under the eye, which is typically not a place Iu2019d DREAM of applying any powder, let alone a pressed one. It sits beautifully, no creasing.

No surprise, I totally fell in love with it and it became my holy grail setting powder. So, naturally, I was pretty hyped to hear about their new pressed version of my favorite Setting Powder.   The powder is very finely milled and feels smoother than the loose powder, likely due to it being pressed. There is a faint, slightly unpleasant odor upon opening the compact, but itu2019s not a dealbreaker for me.  The pressed powder applies beautifully and provides a nice blurring effect, just like the loose version. However, it is much more mattifying. My skin is combo/oily, so I definitely like a mattifying powder. But this one can be a bit much and a little over drying, especially in the under eye area. It unfortunately creates the appearance of fine lines where there weren't any before. So Iu2019ve been avoiding my under eyes and stick to the rest of my face. Normally, I blot my T-zone at least once a day, but with this powder, I rarely have to.   I found using a flat top brush works way better than the applicator that comes with it for applying the product.   If you have oily skin, this powder is definitely worth considering. However, if you have dry skin or concerns about under eye dryness, you might be better off with the loose version.  I received this product for free in exchange for writing a review."

It wasnu2019t too cold or too hot so I cant speak toward extreme climate, but for a 8 hour workday! You are set!   Color Match: There are three shade but I found that with my Deep, Warm face shade, my color was a tad bit light. The range offered was suitable for someone a bit lighter. For reference, I put a side by side of my current face powder from Laura Mercier.  Coverage: Similar to what you would expect from Laura Mercier cult classic! No let downs! Makeup application is key and user error is sometimes the main contributor!  Cons: The blurring effect! Seriously, the last time is used a powder with similar effect was with Tartes u201cSmooth Operatoru201d. Of course, I had to fight with Tartes white cast but as far as the smoothness, it reminded me of that!

It also has this blurring effect to it that makes makeup look like its airbrushed on, and helps my makeup last for hours. Also, for health purposes, it makes me feel safe knowing that this product is talc-free."

The compact is very nice for travel because you have a mirror, the product, and a puff to apply the powder. The compact plastic feels cheap, but it does not look cheap from faraway. I like the puff compartment has holes to allow the puff to breathe and airout. The product looks yellow when I opened it and was a bit worried it would be too yellow on the skin. It does melt into the skin quite quickly and the yellow blends in beautifully and it is not noticeable, there is no whitecast. There is no scent. It does apply smoothly and melts into the skin using the puff. I tried a brush and I prefer the included puff. It does a decent job on my pores but I think my holy grail powder from Huda does a better job on the pores. This also started to look cakey on my chin and nose area as the oils started to come to the surface. It also slightly irritates my skin."

While I can acknowledge that the product does deliver on its promises in terms of setting makeup and providing a matte finish, I found myself not particularly impressed with certain aspects of it. Firstly, the scent was not to my liking. I prefer my makeup products to either have a subtle fragrance or be completely fragrance-free, and the scent of this powder was a bit overpowering for my taste.  Additionally, I wasn't a fan of the included powder puff. It felt a bit rough on my skin, and I found it didn't distribute the product evenly or smoothly. As someone who values a seamless application process, this was a bit disappointing.  Comparing it to the Laura Mercier Translucent Loose Setting Powder, which I've been a fan of for quite some time, I personally still favor the loose powder over the pressed version.  Overall, while the Laura Mercier Ultra-Blur Pressed Setting Powder does work effectively as a setting powder, its scent and the quality of the included powder puff left me feeling less enthusiastic about incorporating it into my makeup routine."

Letu2019s start with the packaging~ the box it came in was sturdy & luxurious, imagine my shock when I pulled out this cheapy plastic feeling compact!?? Recycled materials or not, you can make it better. Tbh, that was one of biggest complaints. For $52, Iu2019d expect more.   This Translucent Pressed Setting Powder looked good with ALL my makeup, It did set it and removed the shine from  my t-zone. Without makeup, terrible- looked dry and actually accentuated my fine lines, It did nothing to blur my pores and very little to blur fine lines. Didnu2019t work the best on my aging skin, however the shine absorption did last almost the entire day! (SEE PHOTO- the left side of face has powder applied only, minimal makeup).  The biggest con in my opinion is the price point & and actual compact packaging. Itu2019s a great setting powder but not worth the price in my opinion. Iu2019d recommend it if price wasnu2019t an issue."

If you are looking for something to take with you on the go for touchups this may suffice when you don't want to risk making a mess with the OG loose setting powder but it is not as comparable.  I didn't get the ultra-blur effect as claimed, especially as a woman of a certain age.  It is not a bad product, it's just tough to have such high expectations for a new line offering when there is already such an amazing product available."

If I apply less, I still have shiny spots on my forehead and chin so too much or too little just doesn't work.  I was excited to try this translucent setting powder and gave it a try with my current makeup regimen.  It really did what it promised.  I applied a little first and built up and to my surprise there was no cakiness and it definitely covered up the shine.  It was truly translucent with no color or tone being added to my face.  A few hours after applying, I checked the mirror and there was still minimal shine and it looked like it stayed in place pretty well.  I did end up re-applying a tiny bit after that because a photograph showed a little shine but overall very nice product."

The powder is nice and light and it does not settle in to my fine lines which is always a plus.

            "review_text": "This is my first Laura Mercier product ever. I was sent this powder compact in exchange for a review. Let's look at the packaging: a matte, blush-pink compact with the brand name typed across the top. A handy push button opens the lid, so it's long-nail friendly. Some of these compacts are ridiculously hard to open, but this one is easy.   The underside of the lid contains a mirror with the powder tray directly underneath. It has two little grooves on either side of the powder tray so you can stick a nail edge underneath and pop open the tray that holds the puff. The puff is a very trendy, two-finger flat puff with the brand name across the top. The very bottom of the compact has tiny holes so that loose powder falls through, I think. Or maybe to keep air circulation from allowing the puff to grow bacteria.  Let's look at the product functionality: It's supposed to make pores look smaller, presumably by filling them with tiny particles of powder (not talc). I used this compact while on a Caribbean cruise, where I knew I would be sweating and still wanted to look good. It only comes in three shades, but I donu2019t think it makes much of a difference if it doesnu2019t match your skin tone. Itu2019s extremely translucent and your real skin color comes through. It only takes a couple of swipes to mattify your face, so I think this compact is going to last a long time! While on my face, it feels silky and NOT dry. By the end of the day, I usually have powder lines from where it settled, but the Laura Mercier never got cakey.  I would recommend this product to anyone who wants to blur their pores without making it obvious they have a face full of powder."

The powder itself has a finely-milled texture that feels lightweight on the skin. It blends effortlessly into the skin, leaving a soft matte finish that helps to control shine without appearing heavy or cakey.  One of the standout features of this setting powder is its blurring effect. It helps to minimize the appearance of fine lines, pores, and imperfections, creating a smooth canvas for other makeup products. This is especially beneficial for those with oily or textured skin, as it helps to create a more flawless look.  The waterproof claim of this powder is another notable feature. It holds up well throughout the day, even in humid conditions or when exposed to moisture. This makes it a great option for those who live in hot and humid climates or for special occasions when you need your makeup to stay in place.  As for the color, the Medium Deep shade is a good match for medium to deep skin tones. It provides a subtle tint without altering the overall color of the foundation or concealer underneath. However, it would be helpful if Laura Mercier expanded the shade range to accommodate a wider range of skin tones."

The Ultra-Blur Talc-Free Waterproof Translucent Pressed Setting Powder does not feel sturdy when held in hand. The puff is slightly rough and reduces the value of the Ultra-Blur Talc-Free Waterproof Translucent Pressed Setting Powder. After opening it, there was a very strong and unpleasant chemical smell but I didn't know if it was from the pressed powder or the puff. When applied it on my skin, I found that the coverage rate was good, but not much different from other products/brands. For dry skin like mine, you must carefully moisturize it before applying. Otherwise, your skin will look like cracked, dry, or flaky."

I was excited to try this product. Upon opening the package, I had mixed feelings.  The product comes packaged in what looks like a thick compact. The outside of the compact is matte and a lighter weight than other high end cosmetic brands. The inside contained a holder for the puff which also felt light-weight.  Opening the compact, I was surprised that there was a moderate scent that I actually didn't enjoy.  The scent is difficult to describe.  It wasn't natural or consistent with other setting powders I have used or sampled in cosmetics stores. Other setting powders I have used before have either had a light powdery scent or no scent at all. I would have appreciated the same scent (or lack of scent) in this product.  After applying my daily foundation, I applied the setting powder with the included signature puff.  I didn't feel that the puff provided good coverage.  Most of the powder seemed to stick to the puff instead of applying to my face.  I switched to my regular powder brush and was more pleased with the results.  My skin looked smoother and my makeup stayed throughout the day.  I didn't notice my skin being more hydrated as the product claimed, but I don't expect hydration from a setting powder, so that wasn't really a big deal to me.   I liked that the powder was pressed.  I have never seen a pressed setting powder before.  There was no spilling or mess on my bathroom counter, which is a big benefit to me.  It is also convenient to throw in my purse and take it on the go.  The translucent honey color was a nice finish over my foundation. Despite a few drawbacks, I was pleased with this product and would recommend this to others.  The product works well and provides a smooth, matte finish to my skin that lasts all day.  I would also buy it in the future."

The Laura Mercier loose powder comes with 20 grams for the same price. This is only 6.5 grams - a third of the product. It will get used up fast.   Aside from that, the powder delivers. I have acne prone dry skin. This works amazing at blurring the skin without making my skin look cakey or dry or settling into fine lines. I also love the puff that comes with the compact - it works well with the product. I have the honey shade, which is for medium to tan shades. I have a medium skin tone and I feel like the regular translucent shade would have worked better for me. I definitely canu2019t use the honey shade under my eyes.

My first impression was that the compact was nice and minimal in appearance, however it is mildly difficult to open the powder portion. It has a strong scent I can't identify and don't particularly enjoy. The scent luckily isn't noticeable on my face like it is in the compact. The next thing I noticed is that it takes A LOT of effort to get it on a makeup brush. Better off using the poof. I have combination/oily skin so I used the powder solo to see how it looked on bare, but moisturized skin. The difference between my face with and without it was negligible. It did nothing to blur my pores and very little to blur fine lines. The shine absorption lasted only two hours. Quite a bit had to be used to achieve even that. All things considered, I do not find this setting powder to be worth the cost. Many drugstore brands outperform for a fraction of the cost. Because I used it on bare skin, rather than on to of concealer or foundation, I didn't want to totally ding it with only one star. Maybe others will have better success with this setting powder on top of other products. I do regularly use other setting powders alone for the mattifying effect."

Iu2019m an oily/combo skin girl and I like to reapply powder throughout the day so I love how easy this is to throw in my bag for touch ups throughout the day. I use it to set my concealer under my eyes and it looks so smooth & I feel like it does blur my pores on my cheeks too!! I did notice that if I put it around my nose and on the top of my forehead by my hairline, it did look a little dry and patchy. If I stuck to applying it to just my t-zone and under eyes though it was fine! It doesnu2019t leave a white cast or u201cpowderyu201d look to your face at all. The packaging is so cute and functional too. Overall, Iu2019m a fan!"

If you arenu2019t and you do anything other than pat the powder into your skin, itu2019ll emphasize every dry little bit of your skin. That being said, itu2019s a great powder to have in your arsenal. It does blur fine lines and gives a nice subtle matte finish that doesnu2019t have flashback as far as Iu2019ve noticed. Itu2019s lightweight and feels nice on your skin, and Iu2019ve found that touch ups later in the day arenu2019t as necessary. My one gripe is the smell. It might be fine for other people, but Iu2019ve got a sensitive nose and it smells very plasticky and off-putting to me. I believe itu2019s supposed to be unscented, but I struggle with it for the first 15-20 minutes until either the smell dissipates or I get used to it. Despite the smell, Iu2019d definitely recommend adding this to your routine, especially if you know youu2019re going to be photographed and want skin that looks so smooth it could be filtered"

First and foremost, one of the standout qualities of this setting powder is its talc-free formula. As someone with sensitive skin, I appreciate products that prioritize skin health. The absence of talc ensures that this powder won't clog pores or cause irritation, making it suitable for all skin types.  Furthermore, the inclusion of hyaluronic acid sets this setting powder apart from others on the market. Not only does it provide a flawless finish, but it also delivers hydration to the skin, ensuring a comfortable wear throughout the day. This is especially beneficial for those with dry or dehydrated skin, as it helps to maintain moisture levels and prevent any cakey or flaky texture.  The long-wear formula of this setting powder is truly impressive, lasting for over 16 hours without the need for touch-ups. Whether you're attending a long day at work or a special event that lasts into the evening, you can trust that your makeup will stay fresh and intact.  Another convenient feature of this product is its packaging. The included puff, stored neatly underneath the powder, makes application a breeze, even when you're on the go. The compact size and built-in mirror allow for quick touch-ups throughout the day, ensuring that your makeup always looks flawless, no matter where you are.  The Laura Mercier Translucent Pressed Setting Powder Ultra-Blur surpasses expectations on multiple fronts. From its talc-free formula and hydrating properties to its long-lasting wear and convenient packaging, it truly delivers on its promises. I wholeheartedly recommend this product to anyone in search of a setting powder that combines performance, skincare benefits, and convenience."

It didn't have the shimmer like the loose powder either which I find to be a good thing. It does have a very odd smell. But overall I really like it."

The powder Apples very finely and does set my makeup well and helps to keep it looking fresh throughout the day! I definitely notice a difference when I use it, compared to the day when I didn't apply it.

The powder itself does a really nice job of mattifying without looking like a ghost. The blurring effect is definitely a nice touch too. I will say that, in this format it would be hard to get a true all-day coverage without it looking cakey, however I think it does a great job for away-from-home application and touch-ups. I've had days where I forget to put powder on at home and this one has lasted most of the day, but not quite as good as my loose powder with powder brush application would.

I can honestly say that I havenu2019t been disappointed! It provides nice coverage to set make up without exaggerating fine lines or looking cakey. It lasted all day and I didnu2019t even take it out of my bag for any touch ups. I also really liked is that it is very versatile. It worked over minimal make up looks and full coverage.  I would recommend this product for someone in the market for a setting powder bc of how universal and effective it is. Bc for this versatility I would recommend this over charlotte setting powder as with that one I canu2019t use on lighter make up days bc that product is a bit more coverage and color and hence noticeable.   Try this out for sure! Laura is a household name and you wonu2019t be disappointed. You can use it for all your needs versus buying so many different ones!  Side note I havenu2019t used her new foundation yet but Iu2019m sure they would be an epic combo so def give it a try!!"

Itu2019s an incredibly smooth powder that feels great on the skin and it definitely blurs the pores in a lovely way while also keeping shine at bay for up to 16 hours; I, personally, found that it actually controlled shine (and kept my  foundation from breaking down) for about 6-8 hours u2013 which, for me and my super oily skin, is fantastic. I like that it contains hyaluronic acid to keep the skin hydrated and comfortable (as opposed to drying it and looking cakey out like so many powders can). I absolutely love the natural, u201csoft matteu201d finish that it leaves. I also like the little puff that comes with it so that it can be used on the go.

For years I've been looking for a good pressed solid powder that performed like my Laura mercier. I am so happy that there is a pressed version of the setting powder because it is by far the best. I absolutely love this new powder it gives me no creases, A nice brightening color, And just the smoothness overall that I've been looking for in a setting powder.I will absolutely buy this again I feel like I've been waiting forever for Laura Mercier to come out with a product like this I absolutely love it I receive this product in exchange for an honest review."

Let me begin by saying I was thrilled to try this because I've heard nothing but stellar compliments and reviews surrounding it. Upon opening, I noticed a weird, chemical-like smell. It is more like a burned, recycled plastic. I checked to make sure it wasn't the powder itself but only the container. I'm sure after some time it would. This in itself was a little off-putting. I like when powders enclose a little puff and it stays in a separate place away from the pan of powder. I'm glad there was also a mirror to see with too. This was used this on moisturized and primed skin to set my makeup.The powder is very, very dry. My face looked like the desert after using. I tried around the eyes, nose and chin/mouth area and could instantly see little lines around them and it made my skin taut looking. I tried to spritz some finishing/setting spray hoping this would help but to no avail. As far as it blurring, it may have helped a little on pores but nothing jumped out at me in the mirror. I do not see the hype for such an expensive product and will stick with my drugstore powder for a fraction of the cost. My suggestion for users would be youthful, combination/oily skin. If you have dry skin or beginning signs of aging, I would choose something else."

Needless to say, I was thrilled to get my hands on THE new Laura Mercier setting powder in Translucent Honey, but she broke my heart. I used the standard Laura Mercier powder puff to apply her. And let me tell you: she went on flawlessly. I looked like a real life filter in spite of my normal to dry skin. However, after just a few minutes of being outside in somewhat humid weather (not rain, just humidity), my face cracked. No joke! My better-than-life makeup cracked and caked and bunched in every unsightly area imaginable! And I had used this powder with a luxury soft-matte-finish foundation! I had never had that happen before when using that foundation, but I figured Iu2019d repeat the test with my favorite go-to foundation, which is lighter and dewier. And this time my own mild perspiration produced the same results. Unfortunately, this product does not seem to be built to survive real life. I give this product one star because of the hopeful and gorgeous beginning brought to a bitter, cakey, clumpy end."

So when I had an opportunity to try their new pressed formula, I jumped at the chance.  The product does exactly as it claims! I've been sick. So- the skin around my nose is dry. I honestly didn't believe that this product would help those problem areas. But guess what, it actually did!!! It set my makeup beautifully without the white cast that some powders do. It is matte. And- it stays matte! No need for touchups! I'm 44 years young. So creasing is a huge concern for me. It blew me away to not see any creasing! I don't think I've ever experienced no creasing without tons of help from several products and technique! My skin has felt unbelievably soft. I know it's bad to touch my skin constantly but- I couldn't help myself. My face is so soft and smooth! The one negative that I noticed with this AMAZING product is there is a odd smell. I don't think it's from the product specifically. I believe it's from the powder puff. But the puff is cute and perfectly sized to get in those difficult areas of the face. So the smell that disappears shortly after use is not a issue for me at all. And YES, I'll DEFINITELY be purchasing in the future!"

A week after wearing, I've not experienced any negative side-effects! After a workday, I found doing one slight touchup (a dab of powder where I'm typically oiliest- in my T zone) and it was just one little press of the powder. The *only* downside to this product?

I was confused at first considering fragrance isnu2019t an ingredient listed, but I later noticed Lilium Candidum flower extract (white lily) was listed. I know lilies tend to have a really strong scent, therefore Iu2019m assuming that could be the strong scent Iu2019ve been smelling. I have combination skin, more on the oily side, therefore I was excited to try this product out and see if it would keep my makeup matte. Unfortunately, it wasnu2019t as long lasting, compared to other translucent powders Iu2019ve used.  As for the positives, this pressed powder is very lightweight, does not oxidize on the skin, and does not leave a white cast nor does it cause flashback with flash photography. Therefore, if you are looking for a good pressed setting powder that isnu2019t too pigmented, providing a natural matte finish, this is a good product to try out!"

I have medium olive combo skin and the honey shade works beautifully on keeping my T-zone shine-free and blurring my pores.

When comparing product i believe my pur powder did have more. But also i believe Laura Mercier powder you can buy refills. It does come with a powder puff but didnu2019t really use it. But now down to how it wears. The reason i have this product a 4 was mostly because of them and the amount is given. But with wear it didnu2019t make my makeup cakey. It did really give me that airbrush finish that i love. I have oily/combo skin. My nose is the first products to go but i did notice the makeup on my nose didnu2019t come off till i took it off. I would definitely recommend this to people who have oily/combo skin. It also come with a mirror which is really nice on the go."

I have combination skin(normal with oily t-zone), for reference. I tried the powder on my friend who has very dry skin type, and the powder flaked off on her. So, take note if you have a very dry skin type. I really like this talc-free powder because this one didn't cause break outs or irritation like talc-based powders. The finish using the included mini powder puff applicator is weightless and velvety. The finish using a large dense powder brush gives me a blurred effect or soft matte.

Itu2019s cute to pull out of your handbag on the go. I am very excited to start adding this into my everyday routine. A little also goes a long way but you can add more since it doesnu2019t leave a cakey effect or anything like that at all. It almost melts into your skin as it heats up with your skins warmth. This talc free formula is exactly what I had been looking for as I swore off powder until I could find something that was both safe and effective unlike so many other products out there. A A benefit is that the powder is pressed and not loose so that it does not get all over the place and the portability is super nice. I would definitely buy this product and my daughter now also would like one for herself as well. I got this product free for my honest review from BzzAgent and am absolutely thrilled that I did.

I was so pleasantly surprised to see that this was the perfect shade option for fairer tones and it does not oxidize! It is finely milled, has little fallout, and doesn't cake or crease into fine lines or settle onto the dry patches under them or on my forehead. The name Ultra Blur is also very apt - the pores on my cheeks looked much better similarly to what you expect from the popular Nars Light Reflecting Setting Powder but with the added benefits of being a tinted pressed powder.  The packaging is also great. It is lightweight, but still feels well made and durable. The puff feels soft and does a good job of pressing the powder into the skin. I like that it has a ventilated bottom to keep it nice and fresh too.  Overall, it's the best pressed powder I've used so far, beating out my Charlotte Tilbury in every category. Hopefully they expand the shade range in the future too so that more people can fall in love with this product too!"

Can you do this with other powders and get similar results? Yes. But does my face actually stay matte the entire day with those other powders? NO. I did a no-no and fell asleep in my makeup. I have combo skin with my T zone leaning oily but dry at the same time. My forehead was still matte the next morning! One thing I will say is to make sure your skin is prepped well as this powder can cling to dry patches. The powder also applied well with a brush, your pores just arenu2019t as blurred like they are when using a pouf. My only gripe, honestly, is the price of this powder.

It feels lightweight on the skin and doesn't leave a heavy, powdery finish, which I really enjoy.  One of the key benefits of owning this powder is its long-lasting performance. I can go a whole day without any touch ups and my face is not shiny. I also appreciate hyaluronic acid in ingredient list as it provides much-needed hydration, making it suitable for all-day wear without drying out my skin.  I would definitely buy this product again. It has become an essential part of my makeup routine, and I can't imagine going without it. The natural, soft-matte finish it provides is exactly what I look for in a setting powder."

My first impressions were the packaging was very sleek and beautiful and also small enough to travel with in your purse. Itu2019s sturdy enough you donu2019t have to worry about the powder breaking though which is great. The powder is extremely soft and finely milled. I have used it with the puff just sort of setting my undereye area and it brightened and also blurred the area under my eyes and set my concealer beautifully without creasing or caking. Even after a full day my undereye looked freshly applied. I also have used it to set my whole face or just my T zone. I truly tested this powder however I could. It set every area perfectly, didnu2019t alter the color or my foundation or base makeup at all, provided blurring for my pores and even helped make my texture appear less visible and my skin overall looked very smooth almost airbrushed. There was no white cast or flashback when using the powder. The puff it comes with does actually work very nicely unlike a lot of other puffs that come with various other powders. Overall I think itu2019s a very versatile powder that you can lightly dust over your whole face or apply in certain areas and my number one favorite which is what made me love it so much is the undereye performance. The blurring, and it was able to set my undereye and not look too matte or obvious I had makeup on. Does not crease or cake under your eyes. I recommend this powder to everyone. I got translucent but there are other shades for other skin tones. I believe any skin type can use this and Iu2019m excited to keep it in my makeup routine!"

The powder is smooth & silky and goes on extremely translucent! I love the staying power of the powder bc I got caught in the rain one of the days I had it on & it stayed put nicely.

I know what to expect; itu2019s too-tier makeup for adults.  The Translucent Pressed Setting Powder blurred my skin without leaving my face dull and dry. Itu2019s lovely with tinted moisturizers on a warm day. I havenu2019t had trouble with my makeup appearing patchy or oily. There is a very mild floral scent (likely from the lilium candidum (white lily) extract. I donu2019t find it offensive, but if you are purchasing in-store, it wouldnu2019t hurt to give it a sniff, keeping in mind it isnu2019t noticeable once applied). I have the honey shade, but itu2019s truly translucent.   The container isnu2019t like typical Laura Mercier products; it is a light weight, grained plastic. There isnu2019t anything on the packaging to indicate that itu2019s from recycled materials. Regardless, it feels a bit cheap. Though there is a place under the product for the puff that is complimentary, itu2019s likely to make a mess if you travel with it for touch ups during the day. The bottom has small holes for the powder to fall out of. Since there is only 6.5 grams of product compared to the 20 grams in the medium size loose powder (which is a few dollars less or more, depending on the type), every bit is precious.   I had a difficult time rating anything from Laura Mercier only three stars, but the cheap and poorly designed packaging and having 14 grams less product than the loose powder is disappointing."

The powder has a silky-smooth texture that glides onto the skin effortlessly. It blurs imperfections and sets my makeup without looking cakey or heavy. I appreciate that it's translucent, so it works well with my foundation without changing its color.  One of the standout features of this powder is its ability to control shine. I have combination skin, and this powder helps to mattify my oily areas without drying out the rest of my face. It also helps my makeup stay in place throughout the day, which is a huge plus.  I should mention that I received this product for free in exchange for a review, but my opinions are honest and unbiased. Overall, I highly recommend the Laura Mercier Translucent Pressed Setting Powder Ultra-Blur in Medium Deep. It's a fantastic setting powder that caters to medium deep skin tones and delivers on its promises of a flawless finish."

On my combo skin it definitely looked powdery. I do like the shade a lot better than the loose powder from Laura Mercier as someone with fair skin, but donu2019t know how it would work on light-medium skin. The biggest downside to this powder is the smell. As someone with sensitive skin I am used to fragrance free products but something about this smells really bad to me. I donu2019t know if it is an ingredient or the packaging which is plastic. I would also hope for nicer packaging for the price point personally. I received this product free for testing."

The powder puff that comes with the compact is virtually useless. The shade honey, should be for medium tones and it is but it has a yellow cast to it.

This translucent powder doesn't feel cakey or dry out, and keeps my face looking fresh and dewy for many hours. I applied with a brush, but it comes with a poof for touchups that I have yet to need to use because it stays put so well. Didn't cause my skin to breakout, and in fact made it feel healthier.

I also used the powder to set a powder foundation - worked great! I worried it would look heavy (powder on powder) but it did not. It looked lovely.   I also used it by itself on a no makeup day. I did not cover any pigmentation (which isn't surprising, since it's not a foundation), but it still blurred my pores nicely.   I have dry skin, so I don't worry about oiliness during the day, but it did tamp down shine after I misted my face, so I think it would work to mattify.   I am a big fan of the Laura Mercier loose setting powder, but I think I like this powder just as much."

I typically don't use a setting powder and when I do I haven't been particularly impressed by any big difference, so it was cool to see the contrast and I plan to incorporate this into my regular routine."

However, my search came to a delightful end with Laura Mercier's Translucent Pressed Powder in the Honey Shade.  First and foremost, the fact that it's talc-free is a huge win for me. Not only does it cater to my sensitive skin, but it also ensures a lightweight, breathable feel throughout the day. The ultra-blurring formula works wonders in minimizing pores and fine lines, providing a flawless finish that lasts for hours.  One of the standout features for me is its matte finish. Despite having oily skin, this powder keeps shine at bay without feeling heavy or cakey. Plus, it's incredibly convenient to carry around, eliminating the messiness often associated with loose powders.  What sets this product apart from others I've tried is its ability to deliver on its promises without causing breakouts. Having experienced this issue with previous brands, I was hesitant, but Laura Mercier exceeded my expectations. It's gentle on my skin, allowing me to wear makeup confidently without worrying about irritation or blemishes.  A little truly goes a long way with this product, making it not only effective but also economical. Overall, I'm thoroughly impressed with Laura Mercier's high-quality offering and would highly recommend it to anyone in search of a pressed powder that ticks all the boxes for oily, sensitive skin.  **#freeproduct**"

I use it in all the same places I usually use my powder, but this one wears extremely well throughout the day. No flakey spots, no spots where it gets greasy and starts clumping up, no massive drying. The only reason I took 1 star off is because I like my powder to work well for under my eyes and my face; I don't want separate powders for these ares. This one was a bit too matte for under my eyes and made my wrinkles a bit noticeable, but again, not because it was flakey or anything like that. Just the wrong texture for my eye area. This powder is also SUPER travel-friendly! Because it's pressed and includes a puff, it has everything you need in the compact in an easy to grab, non-messy, no-spill format. If I were a more matte-finish girl, I would have no problem spending my own money on this. Extra points for no fragrance in the ingredient list!"

However, I did notice a slight oiliness towards the end of the day. Overall, it's a great product for achieving a smooth, long-lasting makeup look."

The packaging is super cute and minimalistic - it reminds me of Rare Beauty's packaging quite a bit. Underneath the pan, there is a tiny little powder puff. I also like the fact that there are air holes underneath the puff, to keep it from storing any type of moisture and molding over.   I definitely will be reaching for this product every day now.

It feels and looks like professional quality.  I found that it keeps my makeup on and in place all day or night for like 7+ hours which is great, esp for going out.
