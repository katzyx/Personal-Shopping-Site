Usually adding new products into my routine will break me out because I have extremely sensitive skin, but I had no problems at all with this serum. I quickly faded my acne scars/sun spots and made them appear much lighter. The only issue I have with this product is the price point. However, this is now a staple in my routine, and I can't imagine myself not using it."

			"review_text": "I love how this applies in quite small drops. It takes very little to cover the face; 1 for forehead, 1 for each cheek, 1 for chin, and 1-2 for décolletage. It feels like you put nothing on. It’s not oily or sticky. It has no smell which is good. I can’t tell yet if it lightens dark spots. I’m 72 and spent far too many years laying out in the sun, many years without sunscreen. Don’t do that. I have some very dark spots. I’ve used 3 other products over the last 15 years, twice a day, and none worked. The others varied in cost (Clinique, Estée Lauder, Lancôme). This ties with Estée Lauder Night Repair. None of those did a thing with 3-5 years of using each 2x a day consistently. We’ll see if this helps. For the price, I’ll try 3 bottles."

He said it was too runny, but he just didn’t know how to  use this type of formulation. Take the time to really rub this into your skin one zone at a time. You will notice that layers of dead skin will start coming off as you rub in the serum. It doesn’t sting or hurt or anything. It’s really awesome to see a Sarah that works, and you can literally feel part of your face that haven’t been touched yet versus parts of the face that have already been touched as you work, the salmon.  Like I said, I’ll never use another serum again and I recommend it to absolutely everyone!  I hope this is helpful. :-)"

Firstly, it gives little to no moisture. when you first put it on, as displayed in many review photos/videos, its super glossy. but it quickly dries down. unlike my other serums, moisturizers dont sink in and just sit on top. the only way i could wear it and not have my skin irritated is if i put my regular serum on top and then moisturizer. for this price it should stand on it's own. No change to my skin tone, no positive change to my skin. It also has a STRONG perfume sent. Unfortunately i purchased this right from their website so I can't return it. going to give it to a friend."

I have tried other products from this line and something about the ingredients is not a good fit for my dry and sensitive skin. I experienced small white bumps, redness, and irritation so I discontinued using the product. Since my skin couldn’t tolerate the serum, I can’t speak to any benefits in terms of lightening dark spots. Here is the most up to date ingredient list: Aqua/Water/Eau, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Coco-Caprylate/Caprate, Squalane, Palmitoyl Grapevine Shoot Extract, Polyglyceryl-3 Distearate, Bisabolol, Glyceryl Stearate, Xanthan Gum, Caprylyl Glycol, Microcrystalline Cellulose, Polyacrylate Crosspolymer-6, Potassium Sorbate, Glyceryl Stearate Citrate, Citric Acid, Sodium Phytate, Sodium Hydroxide, Parfum (Fragrance).(243/032). I do have sensitivities to many fruits and vegetables (eating and some from handling) so I’m not sure if it’s the vine sap or the fragrance or one of the other ingredients that bothered my skin. If you typically do well with fragrance in skincare, this might be an option for you to try if you haven’t seen results from other types of Vitamin C serums. I personally think there are more affordable and effective products available and so I would not personally recommend this serum."

Seeking a more natural approach, I integrated the Vinoperfect spot remover alongside Tretinoin, and it has worked wonders. I noticed a slight improvement within the first week and after almost a month, the results are comparable to the strong prescription treatment with Hydroquinone.

I can cover them with concealer and a BB Cream, but I wanted to finally go to the source. I started using this serum before Caudalie's regular anti-aging cream moisturizer and the results in just a month have been dramatic. We love you, Sephora, but word to the wise: You can find all of Caudalie's products on your next trip to France for half the price. As getting to Paris is not a yearly option for me or for most people, I'm very happy to see that Caudulie US and Sephora also carry the refill versions of the regular moisturizer. I just picked one up on a birthday trip to Paris with my husband (a big birthday). I also talked with a Caudalie representative while in Paris who explained the clinical studies they did to develop the serum and cream. She won me over!"

What I want to highlight about this product is that it's a brightening serum without Vitamin C. I find that if not stored carefully, most Vitamin C brightening products expire faster because of being exposed to light and with this serum you don't have to worry about that.

I have a combination skin type with large pores and dark spots. This is my skin saver. It has a milky serum texture and light bright scent. The serum absorbs quickly into my skin, leaving it hydrated and smooth. I can feel cool after applying it. I use it twice a day. After 2 weeks, I can see my dark spots getting lighter. I hope in the long run it will give the best result."

I have struggled with acne scars and hyperpigmentation from bug bites for so long, and this serum seems to be helping to fade them.

Not only that, but the clean and refreshing scent of this serum puts me in a good mood every time I use it.  While I have only been using it for a short time, I can already see slight improvements in my skin tone and the fading of my dark spots. I feel confident that with continued use, my results will only get better.  I highly recommend this Caudalie brightening dark spot serum to anyone looking to improve their skin tone and fade dark spots. It has quickly become a staple in my skincare routine and I can't wait to see even more amazing results in the future. Thank you to the makers of this incredible product!

			"review_text": "I've been using this Caudalie Vinoperfect serum for about few weeks now, and it's worth the hype  It's a nice serum that has improved my skin!!!. After about a week's use, I noticed my face, neck and chest were much smoother and softer, my skin just loved this serum. By the second week I started to notice an increase in dark spots and hyperpigmentation and became skeptical. I almost stopped using it. It was like the serum was bringing to the surface every blemish I'd ever had on my face. But I decided to stick with it. And I'm glad I did. By the third week, the spots started to decrease and now, at week four, they are starting to lighten noticeably. It's also evened out my complexion and I dont have to wear foundation. I have fewer bumps and blackheads. My skin seems to glow from within. I use the Caudalie serum once a day at night and an illuminating, hydrating serum from another brand during the day. I've read reviews that the Caudalie serum gives people acne. I have rosacea and super sensitive skin, and it doesnt irritate my skin whatsoever, or cause me to break out, even with the light aloe scent. I'm in my 30s so my skin is less oily and more dry than it used to be. It might not suit someone with acne-prone skin.

			"review_text": "'Viniferine' is sixty-two (!!) times more powerful than Vitamin C, according to the packaging! I've not heard of it, or come across it in any other brand before, but it must be potent, because it's almost completely faded a post-acne scar on my chin and it did this alone in under 2 weeks. I state alone because there's barely anything else in this product that could've done it, other than Vitamin E. It's a quite basic and somewhat short, uninspiring ingredients list. Worth noting is that it contains fragrance...far too much of it! Also a fair number of chemicals which I didn't expect in a 'natural' brand, Sodium Hydroxide being one of them. The serum itself is a light milky fluid that you only need 2-3 drops of to cover your face & neck. It sinks in easily and it hydrates too, although you will need to follow up with a moisturizer. I also find it has a nice brightening effect which builds up gradually as you keep using it. The downside is that after nearly 2 weeks of diligent use, this started to break me out so I had to stop using it completely. My guess? Either the fragrance or Glyceryl Stearate SE - a mildly acnegenic ingredient.

I had gotten my skin care routines almost perfect but was still looking for a day time serum that would help with hyperpigmentation that my skin could handle. Vitamin C, Alpha Arbutin, etc would irritate my skin & then this serum popped into my head. I was sad to see it had gone up $10 but I remembered how well it had worked for me & I'm in a better place financially so I decided to try it again despite slight apprehension due to reformulation.   Now my skin is glowing, clear & no more issues with redness. Unless this goes up to a ridiculous price point or is reformulated again & my skin can't handle it, I'm going to keep using it."

I paired it with Caudalie’s Vinopure oil-control moisturizer, and Vinopure purifying gel cleanser in hopes of helping prevent some newer acne from popping up. I’ve been using this product once or twice a day- mainly at night. The more fresh scars faded very quickly. The older, deeper scars are taking longer to fade. Overall, there is a noticeable difference in the scarring within 2 weeks of use. Before I bought this product, I was feeling very insecure of my face every time I was leaving the house. This product has helped me feel like myself again. I’m looking forward to seeing how it continues to perform!  The only con for me, is that I don’t enjoy the smell. The results I have received help me to look past that though."

Caudalie is of course a French brand so obviously it’s cheaper there. Regardless I’ll continue to repurchase here because it is soothing and effective and a great alternative to more acidic vitamin C serums."

I just started using it not realizing there were different formulas, strengths, etc. and my skin went crazy. At first I thought it was the tretinoin I started using, which may have added to the irritation. So I stopped, did some research and decided to try this. I use this, along with their Glycolic Essence, and the Vinoperfect moisturizer. I also use Image MD vitamin C, which is tetrahedral ascorbic vitamin c that has a neutral pH and I use Faded Topicals. Yes, I know it’s a lot but it’s working for me and my pores are no longer clogged. I still get an occasional pimple which you can see in one of the pics on my chin but I think it came from something else I tried to add into my skincare. So I’ve finally found something that works. As you can see in the pics the difference in only 2-3 weeks . I’ve only been using Faded for a week but the Caudalie and Vitamin C I’ve been using for about 2-3 weeks. I’m very satisfied. These will always be in my rotation. Give it time, it does work. I don’t have acne prone skin but it is oily and I do get occasional pimples but nothing to bad. This really works for me. Can’t wait to get my smooth skin back again 😊"

I used twice, AM and PM and the next day woke up with the start of a MAJOR cystic acne breakout. I haven't had acne like that in over 5 years and it took weeks to fully recover from. Really seems like theres something in this product that can be volatile for some people. I personally would advise to reconsider and decide if its worth the risk if you haven't used before."

Two weeks into the bottle I feel like I’ve lost a lot of the progress I made with my vitamin c serum. My fine lines are back, my skin looks less plump, less even and less bright. That doesn’t mean it’s a bad product per se, but it does mean that it doesn’t target the same spectrum of issues as vitamin c so it shouldn’t be advertised as a vitamin c alternative. It only claims to brighten skin and fade spots, vitamin c does more than that. I’m debating whether to finish the bottle or toss it… on top of not being as effective for my needs, I struggle with the smell. I think it smells like cheap, harsh hotel soap. I don’t enjoy applying it. I will not repurchase this and won’t recommend it to anyone who has anti-aging skin concerns to contend with."

I feel more glowy and even and I feel like if I do breakout my dark spots go away faster than before I started using this serum. I’m on my fourth bottle and I actually just bought the jumbo size through the Caudalie site so hopefully that cuts down on how many bottles I go through.

I’ve always struggled with acne-related hyperpigmentation.  I regularly use some combination of a vitamin C lotion, micro-needling pen, at-home chemical peels, retin-A, etc. to address the problem and yet still routinely have dark spots long after a breakout is gone.  Alas, this didn’t end up being the miracle product to replace them all.  I typically use Caudalie’s Vinoperfect Radiance Dark Spot Serum either on top of my toner for everyday wear, or right after micro-needling or peeling to help maximize its absorption.  My skin does overall seem more even in tone, but my acne itself has also improved lately, so there’s less hyperpigmentation being created.  For large dark spots, there doesn’t seem to have been any difference—the spots fade, but not noticeably faster since I’ve been using this product versus my usual products/routines.  That said, I’ve not had any particularly negative experiences or issues with the product.  It makes my face a bit shinier than I would like, but I usually don’t care.  One full dropper is plenty to cover my face/neck, and it’s neither sticky nor greasy.  Smells odd—like it’s just a mixture of random compounds with zero fragrance added—but the smell doesn’t linger so I don’t mind that it’s not a particularly nice smell.  Didn’t have any issues with irritation or anything.  All in, I’d say this serum is just ok, so I definitely can’t recommend it at an $82 price point."

I have been using it twice a day for a month now and  I have already started to see results.  My dark spots and uneven skin tone are fading.  In the morning and evening I cleanse my face, pat it dry and then apply this serum before my moisturizers.  The bulb applicator works perfect as a small amount goes a long way and spreads easily.  The slight fragrance is clean and refreshing but does not linger.  My skin feels hydrated all day long.  I highly recommend this product."

It smooth out the skin and I could tell the color was not as dark. You have to make sure you are following a cleaning regime at night and in the morning prior to applying this product. In the morning apply a spf moisturizer to protect your face from the sun. Especially if you are prone to freckles. The smell of the product was not overwhelming and it had a slight citrus fragrance. I would recommend this product. It does take patience to see results.  #freeproduct"

I like how thin the serum is, and how the scent isn't strong at all! I did breakout a bit but my skin just adjusted to it. It does help fade my healing acne and I'm happy with those results.

The fragrance smells like succulents, kind of earthy but not overpowering at all. This did not irritate my skin or cause me to break out. I used about 5 drops and patted it onto my skin. This was not sticky at all or leave any residue which was great! Besides the high price, this is a great product and I highly recommend!

After that, I began to forget to use it when I was supposed to so applications have been a bit more sparse. During the time I used it like I was supposed to, i did begin to see results with my old dark acne scars. They have faded somewhat but not completely. Hopefully, with continued use, they will completely disappear. My new scars don't seem to be fading yet. I like this serum, but would not pay the $82 for it. I am grateful to have had the opportunity to try it though. #freeproduct"

I prefer my skincare to at least be free of artificial fragrance, and this is definitely not. The floral scent, while nice, is overwhelming to me and gives me a headache. It also doesn’t dissipate. You’re just stuck with a perfumed face for hours. It really ruined this serum for me. If there were a fragrance free version, it would be a truly lovely product, but as it stands, I can’t use it anymore and wouldn’t recommend it if you don’t like scented products.

I need heavy hydration and something that will improve texture.  This product does all of that.   I love how it makes skin feel right after I put it on. It is not greasy or sticky. It is smooth and light and when I’m finished, my skin is glowing and it feels so nice to touch . I have tried this product for a little over two weeks and I see such results already. I cannot wait to see after a month or two of use what is going to do on a couple of my age spots.  Take a look at all the ingredients they have included.

The most immediate thing that stands out is the smell; the product has a perfume/spa fragrance that is not subtle. If you’re sensitive to smells or do not like heavy scents in your skincare, I recommend a sample or smelling in store. I was expecting the fragrance to cause a skin irritation but surprisingly it did not which I was impressed by. The product has a nice texture and absorbs easy (it’s not shiny or dewy). It layered under other products really well. I only used a small bottle however, I didn’t feel like I saw any difference that would make me want to add to my routine. For me personally, there are products that I like more without the cost."

It's not going to work miracles, but as someone who has been on a journey with their skin for 15 years it's been that final product that has me feeling like I have good skin. I've struggled with acne, and extremely oily skin and can still have acne flare ups, but it's finally at a manageable point. I do have some acne scarring and while this hasn't made them go away completely, it's given my skin an even tone -- something I haven't had in years without foundation.   I know the price is jarring, but I think it's worth at least one bottle to give it a try."

It contains a combination of natural ingredients, including vine sap-derived Viniferine, which is known to be effective in reducing the appearance of dark spots and improving skin radiance.  After using this serum for several weeks, I noticed a significant improvement in the overall appearance of my skin. The dark spots on my face were visibly reduced, and my skin appeared brighter and more even-toned. The serum is lightweight and absorbs quickly, leaving my skin feeling hydrated and refreshed.  One of the things I appreciate about this product is that it is free from harmful ingredients such as parabens, sulfates, and phthalates. It is also vegan and cruelty-free, which is a huge plus for me.  Overall, I would highly recommend Caudalie Vinoperfect Radiance Dark Spot Serum to anyone looking for a gentle yet effective solution to dark spots and hyperpigmentation. It is a great addition to any skincare routine and can help you achieve a more radiant, even-toned complexion."

I used it as long as I could but these products are too harsh for my skin for daily use.  Most of my really bad melasma has diminished but I still have some residual spots.  I have been using the Caudalie Vinoperfect twice a day for a few weeks now and while it has not completely taken away my stubborn discoloration, I have noticed that my skin is more even toned, and looks healthier.  This product does not irritate my skin at all, is not sticky, absorbs quickly and I had no problem applying makeup afterwards in the morning.  I like the subtle glow it leaves after application.

I find this product to be a good consistency to be able to use as little as necessary and to not waste any. It soaks in quickly and doesnt leave my skin tacky nor is it drying. I do, however, always finish my skin care routine with a facial lotion. I took off 1 star because I dont care for the perfumey like smell.

This complexion correcting radiance serum delivers exactly what it promises within a matter of days and is a joyous experience to use. The packaging is heavy frosted glass, just transparent enough to see through, but opaque to protect the magic inside. It's easy to dispense a drop or two from the curve-tipped glass dropper, which is all you need to cover your whole face. The milky serum is ideal for patting into your face, neck and décolleté and doesn't feel sticky or heavy when preparing the skin for moisturizer afterwards. It has a light fragrance that I find extremely pleasant. I look forward to smelling it each time I do my skincare routine. I am 35 years old and have lived an active life with too much sun exposure and not enough protection at times so I've developed some dark spots. I've tried so many products that promised to reduce the appearance of dark spots and some have helped, but since I started using this Vinoperfect serum from Caudalíe, I see a difference every morning when I look in the mirror.

			"review_text": "Loving this product! I have tried LITERALLY every Vitamin C product available - whether it's in a cream/liquid/serum or it's mixed with other vitamins/on it's own or 10% or 2% - I have never found a Vitamin C product that my skin tolerates. I have been left with burns or I have very bad, painful breakouts. I have been looking for an alternative serum and have absolutely settled on this one and have repurchased multiple times now. When I have breakouts, I tend to be left with dark marks on my face. I have noticed this product has absolutely improved these dark marks over time, and helps to give my skin a subtle, healthy glow every morning. I only wash my face with a face wash at night, and in the morning use only water to rinse my face. After rinsing with water I apply this product and wait 5-10 minutes before moving on to the next step in my routine. Consistency is key for this serum (like any product), and I have followed this routine daily for the last 8-9 months or so. I've never had a breakout from this product even with acne prone skin, and I've found it has helped improve my overall skin texture as well. I wear makeup daily and have never had any issues or pilling since adding this to my routine as it is a very light, almost milk texture that absorbs into the skin no problem. If you are someone who doesn't tolerate Vitamin C and are looking for an alternative to help lighten dark spots, improve skin texture, and help keep your skin glowing and healthy, I would absolutely recommend this product!"

I will say, I use several drops each use and therefore the bottle only lasts me about 1.5-2months, but personally, the money spent is worth it because I have never found a product that kept my skin so hydrated as this one. ...and I am still going to buy 2 more right now, even after learning its main focus isnt hydration!? Its taken me years to accomplish some form of survival with my dry skin on my face. Using oil based makeup remover plus a milky cleaner and then THIS serum, all at night, has been a life changer for me. I also really love The Ordinary Marine Hylaronics! I will also periodically pair with different face masks before bed, but more often than not a cheaper hydrating sheet mask from amazon suffices. Again, i use 2-4 drops of this on my face by pressing all over. I often do 1-2 more drops in the morning before makeup. Sale rep who initially introduced me to this said product should last 6 months-- that is nowhere the case for me, but the extra drops/running out before a 2 month mark, is my survival goal, so! (Also- a good primer, beauty blender and MAC's water weight foundation also really help my dry skin during/after makeup application this past winter.)"

This company was started in 1995 by a husband and wife from France who believed that their vineyard (grapes) contained the secret to amazing skincare. So all of their products have grapes in them. Their products are safe for pregnant women and people with acne-prone skin, and their packaging is 100% recyclable. After reading all of this, before even trying the products, I was already in love with the brand. The Vinoperfect Radiance Serum claims to target dark spots, dull skin, and uneven skin tone and make it more even and radiant. I used this product in the morning for a little over a week and noticed a visible difference in the natural glow my skin had. It now had one! I also noticed that this product dried down a teensy bit tacky so that gave me an idea. I used it in place of my primer one day and my makeup looked flawless. This product is amazing. A little on the pricy side but so very worth it!"

I have tried Vinoperfect Radiance Dark Spot Serum during the day and then at night consistently for two weeks right after I cleanse my face. The consistency is thick and milky. I used about five drops each application and so far I have noticed an overall brightening effect on my face. As far as the dark spots, I may still need to use it longer because I couldn’t really tell if they are improving or not with this product. I took out a star for the fragrance. To me it’s pleasant and appealing because it reminds me of flowers but it can be overpowering sometimes. I definitely would recommend this to a friend because of the luxurious experience alone."

It helped to calm my skin and restore my texture when I was going through an extremely stressful time mentally but also physically as my environment was stressing my skin out quite a bit. I don't have any major dark spots besides a couple of mild sun spots so I can't comment too much on the efficacy of that claim however I do find using this serum under a moisturizer works well for me in the winter when I need more umph without the weight of a thick cream. That being said I don't notice it does much for long-term maintenance so I will primarily keep it to use when I need a reset for my skin. This does contain perfume but so far has not irritated my skin."

I am aware that they changed their formula recently so I was a little concerned about whether it was still a good product for my skin, but after trying the new formulation, no issue here.  Overall, I find this serum great for giving you that even toned, glowy skin from within. I have on occasion noticed that it had helped with some new blemishes I get on my skin but for the old ones that I have it did not change much. With that being said though, I have sensitive, combination and eczema skin and for a long time I wasn’t able to get anything onto my skin without getting some sort of reaction, so this product really changed my skin care game, and was really the beginning for me.   Though I really enjoy this product and stand behind the 5 stars, I would say that price for the amount you get isn’t a lot and often wished that I could get a larger size of this. In addition, because of the texture of the product, to get the remaining few drops out can take some work but I hate to waste so I make do the best I can.   I have over the years tried to replace this product with other products to see if I could go cheaper but in the end, I still end up coming back to this product."

I've started with the glycolic peel mask, following but the radiance serum days after, and finally the glycolic toner.  Well, it's been three weeks and I can say they have brightened considerably, no foundation for this gal and it's a good thing since I upped my solar protection game. I have to say that I panicked a bit because at first, they darkened, but it's the normal process of cellular turnover to bring the old cell to the surface to be discarded, so no worry! I will continue to incorporate the rest of the line in my routine when I finished my other cream and I will never look back, just love it too much!"

There is a noticeable improvement in the evenness of my skin tone. I use one dropper-full, once a day (morning or night depending on mood) and that covers my face, neck, and upper chest. I should also mention that I use this product in tandem with the Caudalie Vinoperfect Instant Brightening Moisturizer with Niacinamide or with the Caudalie Vinoperfect Brightening Glycolic Overnight Cream. The ingredients list gets a big thumbs up- vine sap that’s more than 60x effective at brightening than vitamin c? Crazy good. I have been using a serum with L-ascorbic acid for years and it’s nice to switch things up, while feeling confident that I’m still feeding my skin.

I’ve been dabbling with a lot of brightening products and this is one of my top favorites.  It sits on the skin so nicely and absorbs quickly.  I purchased the bigger bottle which is sadly no longer available and have been using it about 2 months now.  I’ve gone from never doing skincare to getting heavy into it within the last 6 months.  This is the first product I can say I really saw a difference within the first week.  After using this product and seeing how great it was, I purchased some other Caudalie products and I’ve really loved them all!  I have sun spots from over exposing myself to the sun and years of tanning bed abuse, they have absolutely lightened to the point I cannot see them anymore unless I look really close.  Mainly on the top of my forehead I have sun spots, near my hairline.  I also have some uneven looking skin in other areas that has greatly improved to the point they’re not there anymore.  At first I thought it was all in my head, I was seeing what I wanted to see until my coworkers, family and friends all started complementing how bright and glowy my skin was!  I am a huge caudalie fan now and will continue to keep this in my skincare routine.  I hope they never discontinue or change the formula - I am in LOVE and can’t believe how much this product has changed my skin for the better!!  I don’t even wear foundation anymore :) if you’re wondering if you should get this, because it is pricey, give it a chance.  I don’t know if this is meant for dry skin but in combination with my moisturizer and other products, my skin has stayed flake free while using this.  I also wear this under my makeup as well and don’t have any pilling."

Here’s what happens: - it works well for me at first — my skin brightens, looks great and feels great... - then, after a few weeks I start to notice lots of clogged pores. At first, it’s nothing crazy and it’s bearable. But then, they start to get big and cause issues, making skin look super textured, and makeup starts to look terrible - I stop using it on my face and end up finishing the bottle on my neck and chest lol.  I’ve learned after lots of research that my skin simply can’t handle creamy serums like this. So I’ve switched to a non comedogenic balm, which is much better for my skin type."

I don’t think it claims to help with pimples, but when I do end up with hormonal acne or pimples by trying out a new face product, it always helps make the pimples go away that much faster and reduced the overall appearance. The times that I have ran out of this and hadn’t repurchased it, my complexion was uneven and I could tell I needed to buy this serum again.  This has a very very faint scent but goes away and I will say that the 1oz bottle only lasts for a few months when used every night (I only use this at night after a regular wash, exfoliating wash or mask). Highly recommend making the investment over other serums!"

I’ve repurchased this item probably a dozen or so times since I first discovered it a few years back (got it as a 100pt perk). It’s the best for my older acne scaring though and just overall makes my skin glow. Daily use and I barely need any foundation, just some concealer under my eyes and we’re good to go!

			"review_text": "A little about me- I’ve been suffering from melasma for almost 5 years. Cause for it is probably birth control pills, not 100% sure. Had melasma when I miscarried 10+ years ago but hydroquinone cleared that up easily. NOTHING, until Vinoperfect, has even made a dent. I’ve used tretinoin, C+E Ferulic, 4% Hydroquinone, kojic acid, diet changes, glycolic acid, Differin gel, dermaroller, face shaving. I got a sample of it from Sephora awhile back and I thought maybe it was helping but I didn’t use it regularly so I wasn’t sure. In November I bought the full size and began using it 1-2 times a day, always in conjunction with The Ordinary’s Vit C powder in the morning and/or Differin gel (and sometimes 10% glycolic acid cream) in the evening. The results? I can tell that it is working!! Mind you, it’s not entirely gone. If it does go away entirely I will update and change to 5 stars (although honestly, this should probably be a 5-star review considering it is the only thing that has helped). Before Vinoperfect, you could definitely see the melasma even after using foundation or concealer — covering it up just made it less obnoxious. Now, you can barely tell it’s there with cover up, maybe not at all. And for the first time in years, I sometimes go without foundation/concealer. It’s there, but it’s definitely lighter and I don’t feel self-conscious like I once did.   It’s interesting though- for me, it doesn’t seem like it’s broken up much scarring or freckle-type pigmentation. I get the little shadow scars from acne that doesn’t even break skin. But that’s not what’s bothered me these last few years. It’s the splotchy, uneven tone of melasma that I’ve hated for so long. I never wore foundation before melasma and until Vinoperfect, I tried so many different brands, color correctors, you name it. And now to not have to feel like I’m fighting it every day? I might just change my review to five stars!"

Expired product? Who knows... in any case this is usually one of my favorite serums cause the glow is immediately noticeable. Granted that the glow doesn’t last alllll day but it’s miles ahead of comparable products. I also like that it doesn’t have any acids in it unlike almost every other product on the market these days - a plus for sensitive skin imo. It’s not tacky to the touch or heavy and smells wonderful. I have sensitive skin and it has never once broken me out but I stopped using it to try other serums just cause the price tag was a bit high and I have yet to find a comparable serum. It also lasts quite a long time, my small bottle lasts almost 3 months so the price evens out compared to $50-$60 serums that last a month. Overall great product. They just need to figure out why the online serum is thicker than the store bought serum and why it has a different dropper cause I lowkey felt scammed and don’t know if I can trust Sephora anymore"

I've been using this product since 2019 to get rid of a dark sun spot on my left cheek—mainly caused by every day commute and all the UV exposure to the left side of my face as I drive. This patch has lightened considerably, to the point that I don't need to use this serum as much as I did at the beginning. Like every good social scientist/researcher, I believe more in the effects of longitudinal studies, and I'd say over a year's time of observation is sufficient proof of this product's effectiveness. (The one confounding variable is I don't need to drive as much as I used to since March of this year, so arguably, that side of my face has not been exposed as much as it used to be, but even before March of this year, I had noticed significant improvement, so I still give much credit to this product.)"

I've used this product more on than off the last two decades because whenever I've NOT used it, I've noticed a near-immediate difference (within the month) in skin tone and texture. My skin is VERY reactive to certain oils and silicones, and this serum works amazingly well for my purposes (which is looking as flawless as possible without foundation).  A note on my headline: at this point, I only use this in the morning (unless I need to wash my face before a date?? whaaaaat??), so an ounce will last me a couple of months. If I had to, I'd probably pare down everything else in my routine (leaving myself with just an oil-free cleanser, a toner, a moisturizer, a balm [instead of eye cream], and an oil-free sunblock) to afford this.

I saw some results after the first bottle (lasted about 6-8 weeks), but the real skin transformation happened during the second bottle. It is easy to apply, absorbs quickly, smells great, and doesn't make me break out (which almost everything does!). I always wanted a product which made foundation feel optional, and this totally did that. The main downside I would say is that it takes a while to work and is very expensive.

This works better than Vit C for acne and sun damage and can be used in conjunction with other products (like Vit C) to attack dark spots on many fronts.  This works on the deep layers with grape vine sap and that not only gets rid of the spots there but also tells the skin to slow production of the melanin, so less spots are waiting under the surface. So light-weight, like a milk and absorbs totally.  Easy to wear make-up over it.   Tip/Trick:  If you have bad under-eye dark circles, pat the residual from your finger tips, under your eyes after applying to your face. Do not direct apply as that may be too strong on the eye area but a small amount of the the grape sap, will increases blood flow to that area and reduce the darkness."

I have some faint sun spotting on my cheeks and am always looking for something that may help.  Unfortunately, I tried it once and won’t be using the rest of the packets.  The first thing that struck me was the scent.  I’ve been using unscented or faintly/natural scented products for a long time so I’m not accustomed to perfume-y serums.  The fragrance isn’t unpleasant but it’s strong and SO unnecessary in a face serum!  Do people really need this in order to like a product?!?   It’s been shown that fragrance isn’t good for our skin so why companies continue to add it baffles me.  In addition to the fragrance, the texture is very sticky and uncomfortable.  I had to wash my face and hands shortly after using this!  Nowadays there are so many wonderful skin care companies making products with quality ingredients that are affordable...  I don’t see why anyone would spend their hard earned money on something like this.  If this works for you I’m glad but I definitely wouldn’t recommend it."

Its a great base for moisturizer. I love everything about it. I saw a review that said it lasts two weeks, girl your using it wrong then. It should last 6 months or more! I would say maybe it would be better in a pump. I dont know if opening it twice a day affects its potency or stability but its been around long enough and the company is successful so really no complaints here.

Disclaimer, I didn't do a before and after photo so of course, it may be that I had too high expectations (after all this costs a lot, and the employee did hype it a lot). But I've definitely seen more satisfying results from using Vitamin C. If you want to see results on your skin, this might not be for you. Or maybe just not for people in their twenties or people who already have pretty unblemished skin. I would give three stars, but given how expensive it is and the alternatives out there, giving two.   If you do buy, they occasionally have value deals where they sell the full-size serum along with a toner and other Caudalie item for the same price as just the serum. Would recommend you buy it then.

For reference, I have had eczema and KP and generally allergy-prone irritable skin my whole life, and KP on my face around my jaw (let me know otherwise if it sounds like something else). My face never felt soft, no matter what moisturizers, oils, or natural whatever I put on my face.  This serum completely improved the texture, and with minimal use. I was so pleasantly surprised because I wasn't expecting it.  The price is a little steep, but they keep offering the full-size sets for the same price with extra products, which is really awesome. And for the fact that it actually creates a noticeable difference, I'd rather buy this every so often then go through other stuff that don't make much of a difference."

I didn’t pay much attention to it navies I’d isn’t wanna get my hopes up...  it after a couple weeks I noticed how beautiful my skin was!! I finally took the plunge and bought the large size and have never turned back since! I have sensitive skin and this worked beyond well for me. I am so in love with it and it was definitely a game changer for me. Whenever I run out of it I hate it cause I notice the dullness in my skin. Def a must have!"

For reference, I am an African American woman with oily skin who scars very easily and has many dark spots due to old anxiety-driven-picking habits.  Ill start with what I'm not crazy about: I use this serum directly after washing my face with the Caudalie Gel Cleanser. No matter how you apply it, there is a tacky feeling that doesn't seem to go away UNLESS you follow up with a moisturizer (I use Caudalie's moisture sorbet cream).  What I love: Since using it, my skin tone appears more even and more radiant--I've got a little glow pre-makeup. This isn't an overnight product -- it's definitely taking some time to rid myself of the dark spots. I don't use this twice a day -- only in my morning routine, yet my scars are noticeably improved after a little over a month of consistent use.  It has a high price tag however a little goes a long way (2-3 drops will suffice for full face coverage). Ive tried so many products and one way or another my skin seems to have an issue with everything. My skin loves Caudalie's line and more specifically this product. This is a definite repurchase."

Keeps my skin feeling smooth and hydrated and did help even my skin tone (it’s not a retinol so I don’t expect drastic results). But my skin is sad when I run out and it doesn’t have this.

I also use the beauty elixir spray before I moisturize or after and I find it very refreshing on the skin. Not sure if it adds to the glow but it smells good and a bottle lasts forever so I keep using it.  When I don’t use the radiance serum for a few days I do notice a dullness in my skin so I believe that the serum does work as advertised.  I’m in my mid 40s and people on average think I’m in my early to mid 30s. So I’m guessing it’s a combination of this product, eating clean and good genes.  I also use Caudalie in general, because of its overall cleaner ingredients."

			"review_text": "I’ve used this serum for almost two years, before it was even marketed as a spot lightener. I was doubtful at first, but after 2-3 months of once-daily use—I am thrilled with the stuff. It’s lightened my many dark spots from sun damage. It’s made my skin smoother, softer, and  visibly younger. At 55, I regret all the years of sun worship. As a fair-skinned redhead, I was stupid not to use sunblock, and my skin has made me PAY. But this lovely serum has helped so much, especially since I use other Caudalie products too. Remember this is a natural, “clean” serum that takes time to work. A few months may go by before spots really start to lighten up. But you will see improvement sooner when it comes to tighter looking pores, creamy smooth skin, and general glow-from-within skin. The spot lightening is more gradual, but gentler by far. I also use it once daily on my chest, which was a rough, red bumpy mess...covered with freckles & sunspots. I’m still amazed by its effect on my sun-baked chest & décolleté. It’s now smooth & silky, and the 5 million sun spots have been either lightened or fully disappeared. But real progress takes time. This serum is gentle and contains no harsh actives like retinol, Vitamin C, or chlorella which is really bad for skin and body in the long term. (Lookin at you, Kiehl’s!) Be patient, let the Caudalie formula do its thing; you’ll be so glad you invested the money in yourself. Yes it’s expensive, but no more costly than most Vitamin C or retinol products. In the long run, clean skin care with all-natural ingredients is so much better for your skin. I use this along with the Premier Cru serum and The Cream, and I’m so happy with skin that looks about 40, instead of 55. (See Before & After pics below.) No needles, lasers, chemical peels ever. Just younger looking, brighter skin that feels superb. As my adult daughter said, “You can really tell when people take good care of their skin, like my Mom does.”  :)"

Within one day of discontinuing use my skin started to improve.  I also really REALLY wish the company would eliminate the fragrance in this product. I’m accustomed to fragrance being in products, but it tends to be toward the end of the ingredient label. This serum has fragrance in the middle of the ingredient label. And you can tell the moment you use it, how strong the fragrance is. As a melasma sufferer, “fragrance” is on my radar for things that make it worse."

Caudalie products are made in France and the ingredients are always top notch. The product comes in a dropper bottle which I love for easy application. The dropper also prevents you from wasting any product. It looks like thick milk as it is coming out of the bottle. The consistency is in between a liquid and a syrup. It feels amazing going onto the skin and it absorbs almost immediately. It leaves my skin feeling so hydrated and smooth. Time will tell what it does long term but I loved the application, texture and immediate results of this product."

And that doesn't surprise me - there is nothing in the ingredients list that suggests the ability of this product to treat dark spots. This is not a brightening treatment. It IS a pretty decent hydrating serum, thanks to the squalane and hyaluronic acid, which is the reason I gave two stars. But frankly there are much more effective products on the market for a fraction of the cost.  As for being 62 times better than Vitamin C? Absolute rubbish. First, there are NO scientific studies verifying this. Caudalie literally just made that claim up. Second, I went back to my Holy Grail vitamin C product (Derma e Vitamin C Concentrated Serum) after finishing my sample bottle, and within three days I saw brighter, more even-toned skin than anything I got using the Caudalie.

This has been the holy grail and people noticed my skin immediately. I first used the sample from my PLAY box and within a few days of use my skin clarity was completely different. I had a dewy but not oily look (a healthy look), my pores had shrunk, and after finally buying the full size product a few weeks (total) my acne scars are lightened. I haven’t had one breakout at all. I got compliments of my skin on an unfiltered Instagram picture and in person at work when I hardly had any makeup on. I am more confident since my skin has healed up and can’t wait to continue to use it so my skin can finally after 26 years become perfection!! $79 dollars is a lot but so worth it for good skin. Highly recommend!!!"

Sooo glad I remembered it because my skin LOVES this serum. Being African-American it can be hard to find something to get rid of dark marks quickly, but not bleach my skin. The Vinoperfect is a miracle in a tiny bottle that I seen results after 2 days of using. It's been a week now and my skin is looking fabulous! I would normally NEVER think to spend this much on a product but it's and absolute must for me now. I will definitely be purchasing a full size when I run-out."

I noticed an almost immediate difference in my skin: by day three, my skin looked brighter and felt completely moisturized, something I’ve never felt even with my favorite moisturizer.

I ended up dropping the $ on the full size bottle in December and it’s now February. I’ve been consistently using this in the AM and PM every day and have gone through about 1/4 of the bottle. This serum is so legit.... I’m writing this review today cause I noticed this morning that my skin tone has really evened up, and it’s the first product that has actually done this for me. The radiance and glow effect of this serum is something you get from day 1, which I loved. But now the actual dullness and spots of my skin tone...I’m just so impressed! If it’s only been a couple months and I’m seeing these kinds of results, I’m super curious to see what my skin will be like a year from now. I can confidently say this is my fav serum and this has reached holt grail status in my routine. Other than the steep price, I can see myself continuing to buy this for a very long time.   For reference, my skin type is generally oily and dehydrated with the monthly burst of acne. I think this serum plus the gokujyun premium really saved my skins moisture barrier."

			"review_text": "I have a pretty low-maintenance skin care routine now.  For the past couple of years I tried to improve my skin with Deciem products - I’ve struggled with visible pores, dark spots, sun damage. All of the acids and peels and vitamin c serums I’ve tried in the past had left my skin dry, irritated, and visibly patchy.  I had a 500 pt reward and redeemed it for the Caudalie set it included this serum, the Vinoperfect Essence and the moisturizing sherbet lotion. I honestly just tried it, because I had it sitting under my sink. After just a couple days of use, folks were asking me if I was on some new clean eating regimen (I was not!). After a month I really noticed a huge improvement in my skin altogether: it was glowing, balanced in moisture, no longer oily in patches, the dark spots were gone... I was seriously in awe. Then I had sticker shock when I decided to buy full sized bottles.  But I sucked it up and bought both the essence and the serum and I couldn’t be happier.  My evening skin routine is so fast (I’m notoriously lazy about skin care before bed). I use a micellar water to wipe my face clean, then I apply a balancing toner from Origins. I splash about three shakes of the essence into the palm of my hand, pat my hands together and gently press the essence into my face. While my skin is still damp from the essence I apply a few drops of this serum evenly over my face and neck. And that’s it! I don’t even need to add another moisturizer, my skin can breathe at night and my face looks dewy and glowing in the morning. Now, I don’t have to wear any makeup on my face (no BB cream, foundation, concealer or tinted moisturizer...) so I’m saving loads of time prepping for my day.  A parent I was speaking to was telling me that she was so much older than me, and when she learned that we were actually the same age- she was shocked.  Despite the price tag on this line, as long as you dispense the minimal amount of product - it will last a very long time."

I would highly recommend this for girls who have spots from picking at your acne and you want something that actually works. This product is worth every penny for $79 a bottle.

Now as far as brightening properties, I haven’t used the serum long enough to make that claim.  However, my skin overall, looks more even.  I still have minor dark spots that I can say are lightening up.  I do use this serum along with 2 additional serums (one of which is a vitamin C).  I also use the essence prior to this.

I love this serum so much because it is so lightweight, absorbs quickly, and you can see radiance come from within almost immediately. I wear this product with my daily moisturizer and feel confident in my skin, no makeup required. I feel like you can see the visible benefits after about 6-8 weeks of using  the product, where your skin is bright, hydrated, and radiant before you put the serum on. I have gone through over 6 bottles of this stuff and it's the best. I feel like its better than any Vitamin C serum I have tried and leaves my skin feeling fresh. I highly recommend this product."

I purchased this because I was fed up nothing was working and I was like let’s give this a try before I stop using anything. I’ve been on it for only 2 weeks and a half and omg I see a world difference! Some of my spots completely faded , some are still there’s but significantly lighten up! Of course my skin still has spots ( because my skin was so bad) but I believe in a month from now my skin would be back to normal! I wake up and can’t believe what I’m seeing! Helped with my texture as well and didn’t break me out at all! Which usually vitamin c serums do, so I’m so excited! If you have problems with hyper-pigmentation and dark spots, get this and give it some time!! I know I left a review about Koress serum being the number one thing that changed my skin but after I used it for a longer time it broke me out like never before! And I rly wanted to delete my review but i didn’t know how! So now I could proudly say this has been the only product that has worked for me and is saving my skin!!"

I have a larger cyst under my chin that has been there for almost 6 months and has looked like a bruise and it’s finally gone!   The rest of my cystic acne on my chin is clearing up and even my little pimples on my cheeks have gone away. I’m so happy This was recommended to me. I use Cereve foaming wash then use the garnier micellar water, the Caudalie essence and finish off with this serum. It has taken the place of my moisturizer and vitamin c serum. I will say it smells a little weird at first like white grape juice water lol but I got used to it and the results. Love"

I also usually break out from a lot of new skincare products and I was so surprised to see ZERO pimples or breakouts thus far. Although it is on the pricey side, I'd gladly pay the price for this again when my bottle runs out. All in all, one of the few products that claim to do what it does. Thank you, Caudalie!"

I first use the brightening essence and then pat on this serum right after followed by my usual moisturizer. For me, personally, the finish of the cream is a little sticky and takes awhile to settle. For make-up users, i think the tackiness is great to set with powder? I am trying to wean off using make up and so I do not use any foundation or powder before i leave the house - so the stickiness gets to me a little in the day.   That said, apart from the texture, just within these 3 weeks, I have noticed improvement in my skin texture and also a visible reduction of my acne scars!!! ("

Unfortunately, the positives stop here.  After using this serum for 1 day, my face turned into a scaly dry mess. I looked like a snake shedding skin. So gross. It was on my cheek, nose,  chin, and forehead. I was hoping the serum wasn't the culprit but it was the only thing I changed in my routine. I decided to give it another try this week. Again, awful scaly skin. It is patchy, dry, and borderline scabbing in some areas.   Definitely try on small area before use. My skin is not very sensitive but it definitely was not about this serum. I look like a dry serpent monster thanks to this."

Three years later, I still use this serum and it’s the only one that I have used. After consistent use, my skin has seen dramatic differences. Complexion is brighter, even skin tone, and the acne spots are gone. People have asked me what foundation I use and you know what I tell them? I’m not wearing foundation. It’s that amazing.

This serum has drastically reduced the amount of time that the spots stay on my face, and most of them actually disappear within 2 or 3 days. My skin is EXTREMELY sensitive, but I’m pleasantly surprised that this product hasn’t made me break out or have any kind of irritation. I’d like to buy all of the products from this line and see how well they all work together. Nonetheless, I’d recommend this serum to anyone and everyone I know struggling with acne hypermigmentation and dull skin.

After a few uses, my skin started to feel healthier, softer, and hydrated. It wasn’t until a month or so in that I started to notice my dark spots lightening up and healing. It helps keep my skin hydrated throughout the day. It’s been a few years now and I have lost count of how many bottles I’ve gone through. It’s one of my holy grails and when I don’t use it, I visibly see a difference in my skin (more dull, doesn’t heal well, no glow). My skin has become more radiant, healthy, and many of my scars have lightened up/disappeared.  This is not a stand alone product. It’s something to add to a skincare routine. It doesn’t solve for breakouts, but heals them better and maintains balance in your skin. I love this and would recommend to anyone looking for something to soothe, hydrate, and brighten."

It was so smooth and soft, some of the bumps and roughness that had been there had smoothed out, and my face just looked and felt brighter and younger. Using a serum can feel like an unnecessary step, like you're just putting a lot of junk on your face, but this one is worth the extra step, worth the extra few bucks. Give it a minute or two to absorb before putting on your moisturizer and it won't feel so sticky.

ON ME It did not do much but cause me to break out with tiny little pimples. I would stop using it and my skin would go back to normal, and then 2-3 days after using this daily I would break out again. I’m one of the blessed ones that never breaks out so there’s something in it that my skin hates. So just keep that in mind. I then took off another star because even though I’ve been using it on and off, I haven’t really seen any difference in my skin. My other serums show a big difference in skin texture and over all health after about three days. This didn’t. ☹️"
