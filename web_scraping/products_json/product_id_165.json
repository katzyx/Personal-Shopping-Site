If you find this leaving your hair brittle and hard I'd return because that means your hair doesn't need that much protein! I love Curlsmith's protein treatment and Blueberry Bliss' protein leave-in which are great every day options.  I apply this after shampooing and leave anywhere between 5 to 20 minutes. My hair starts to feel incredibly soft 2 minutes in!! I rinse out and follow with conditioner since I do think none would leave my hair brittle later on. Potent formula!"

When I was given the opportunity to try this strengthening treatment, I wasnu2019t sure what to expect.  The key ingredient in this product is rice water. Itu2019s a weekly treatment to strengthen your hair and improve it from being brittle, damaged and dry.  You are supposed to massage it into damp hair after showering and leave in for at least 10 minutes or overnight before rinsing out.  I didnu2019t have the patience or time to rinse out afterwards so I just left it in without rinsing off. I was able to do this because the texture was light and not at all greasy. The texture looks and feels like a facial moisturizer.  It did not weigh my hair down at all! After using this, my hair looks healthy, shiny and full. My husband commented that my hair looks much thicker. Iu2019m really glad I tried this product and will definitely re-order when Iu2019m done. My hair gets dry and brittle so this is perfect for me!

It's hard to tell if it is applied on damp hair since it doesn't leave your hair softer like conditioner or a mask. However, my hair was soft when I rinsed it out with water! I followed up with conditioner and after everything, I feel like the treatment did help my hair a bit! It's easy to comb through and doesn't seem as brittle as before!

That being said, I thought this would be an interesting way to check out this trend and soften my chemically treated hair. This definitely fortifies my hair but leaves it stiff/stringy and a bit dull, verging on greasy. I would never be able to rinse and style this, and it makes my hair unbearably greasy by the second day. I thought I was using too much or not rinsing enough, but when I tried correcting for either it just left my hair dry. This also caused next-day hairstyles to collapse.

At the moment, I am highlighting about every 5 weeks to lighten the died strands, and to maintain the integrity of my hair, I have been using products to help strengthen and condition.  I started with Olaplex - and while decent - wasn't overly impressed.  K-18 was next and honestly, I just can't understand the hype as it did nothing.  I decided to give this system a try and WOW.  In ONE wash my hair is silky, shiny and looks fantastic!  I got the oil, mask and conditioner.  First off, you'll be impressed by the AMOUNT of product you get.  I finally feel like the investment matches the bottle size.  It smells pleasant, the conditioner feels like a drink of water going on your hair and the results were amazing.  I rarely review, but was SO impressed felt like I had to share the experience!  Highly recommend!!!"

Normally, I would pay, but I decided to buy the product and I am glad I did. Once I took out my braids, my hair was dry and brittle. After I wash my hair, I put the product in and left it in overnight. It left my hair soft and easy to detangle. I have notice I was going back to pump out product several times for one section. I followed up with the avocado deep condition which help restore my hair as well."

Itu2019s a protein treatment that is hydrating as far as protein treatments go, but protein treatments are not hydrating so a follow up mask is needed.    My hair once dried and straightened was sooooo shiny and remained super shiny for four days!   Awesome product.  Beware to those who donu2019t know, protein is great for damaged and porous hair but donu2019t overdo it as too much protein seals the cuticle making it unable to absorb moisture.  I reccomend using products without protein for a few days following this treatment and to use this only once a week as directed."

You can leave it on for 10 minutes, or overnight as per the bottle. I left it in for roughly 15 minutes, and detangled prior to application.   It's a little misleading though, because you need to use it in combination with the Don't Despair Repair deep conditioner mask in order to get the moisture balancing out of it.   That being said, my hair is super shiny and my curls (some waves, some curls) are bouncier than they were before! Definitely will be working into my routine and using again!"

This is a strengthening, protein treatment. They have added some conditioning agents so that your hair doesnu2019t feel dry afterwards, but if they added more the product would not be able to do its job, which is repair with protein. Strengthen the hair. I have curl hair, 3 a & b, high-porosity, prone to too much moisture. I had been doing modified rice water rinses and that was helping tremendously, but thatu2019s a serious pain. This stuff works just as well-maybe Iu2019ll find that it works better but Iu2019ve only used it a few times. If you want more moisture with a little protein, Briogeo has a deep conditioner for that which I find to be amazing. After using this the first time, my curls spiraled from my roots to the tips and dried with a diffuser in a reasonable amount of time.  Such a great product."

My hair is smooth, the ends are not dry and my hair feels very soft. I haven't been using this product for a long time, but so far I like how my hair looks.

I like it, my hair feels super cleaned not dried out but do I notice a difference? Not really, the color is beautiful a nice light and bright pink, itu2019s a 2 way technology like the clarins serum. Would I recommend or buy this product probably not. I love all of the briogeo masks so I would probably stick to those in the tubs. My ends still feel dry, it does reduce the amount of frizz and my hair looks and feels healthy but so do the other masks. I rated 3 stars based off price and because I feel like I use so much product."

This product doesn't smell bad at all! It smells like their don't despair, repair deep conditioning mask. It's so hydrating and easy to use. I wash my hair like normal then I wring it out in the shower and then apply this and let it sit for 10 minutes with a shower cap on then to the rest of my shower routine then rinse out. I have extremely thin and fine textured hair that tangles easily and is pretty dry and I've already noticed a difference using this product just a few times! My hair feels hydrated and stronger and looks great when I blow dry it out after having used this. I will definitely be repurchasing this product once I've used my first bottle up!

I leave it on for about 15 minutes while I exfoliate, shave etc, and then rinse. This leaves my hair feeling fuller and stronger (it does look visibly more repaired, almost like after using a bonding treatment) and I can notice even more especially after my hair gets dry.  I use this only once a week since I do not want to overwhelm my hair with too much protein. I always appreciate the clean ingredients and no sulfates or parabens. Overall itu2019s a great product and I highly recommend for an extra step."

I used the Briogeo Rice Water Treatment in the shower and was amazed by the results. After I finished showering, my hair had turned from straw to silk. I love how this treatment uses natural ingredients and that Briogeo is a vegan, cruelty free, and gluten free brand. It's so hard to buy hair care items without realizing there are all of these terrible sulfates in the products that are bad for both your hair and the environment. I am in love with this product and will definitely try out more Briogeo products in the future!"
