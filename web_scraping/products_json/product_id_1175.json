The conditioner is not bad but it doesn't do much when the shampoo has wreaked havoc on your hair. If you wanted to mix and match the conditioner with another shampoo it would probably be fine."

I have worked really hard to eliminate a lot of ingredients from my skin care / makeup, but I had not made it to my shampoo and conditioner yet. I wanted to try this because I wanted to make sure that my hair would still smell clean if I eliminated fragrance from my hair care routine as well - and lo and behold, it worked! I love the fragrance free versions of their shampoo and conditioner and I love the scalp serum. I feel like I really could tell a difference in my hair after a few weeks of using this. I have a couple other brands I am going to try before I commit to one shampoo / conditioner but this is definitely high on the list. The lather of the shampoo is great and it rinses well. The conditioner, I haven't had to use a lot of, because I have fine / thin hair, but it didn't weigh me down."

I do however love the packaging and will likely use it with a different shampoo inside.

It has a watery consistency that dried down without being oily or sticky."

The scalp serum is ok only tried it a few times so I can't say much about it. But I am about to return it as it isn't worth keeping to sometimes maybe use the shampoo. Glad I got the travel set before bothering to invest in full size. I was hopeful but was weirdly let down."
