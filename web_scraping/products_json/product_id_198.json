I completely agree with the rave reviews. First, the color is very lively and really brightens up my face. Second, when you blend out whether with fingers, brush, or sponge, it blurs seamlessly into the rest of your makeup and looks like lightening up from within. You can also easily layer the blush for more pigment. The blush is also highly pigmented so I know this product will last a while because a little goes a long way. I prefer this to the rare beauty liquid highlights because it feels better on the skin."

            "review_text": "Okay, this is IT. Blush is the most important part of my makeup routine and I'm very particular about formula and color. I had been trying out as many blushes in sephora that I could before I stumbled on this one. It didn't look very promising, but I did a double take when I tried it.  The pinks are what pink blushes need to be: flushed and dolly. They need to be seen to be appreciated! I thought it was too bold on first swatch, but it looks perfect on the cheeks. You can use it lightly and get a more natural finish, but the pinks are so balanced that it'd be difficult to look overdone even if you use a lot (and trust me, I'm not light-handed). Besides that, it dries down matte, but it's a blurry almost cloudy matte that actually makes it look poreless. I tend to stay away from powder blushes because they either go on chalky, look like a weird film on my skin, or have awful color payoff. And I don't like glossy, dewy highlighter blushes because it makes your cheeks appear oily and bloated, sticks to your hair, and is pointless because the finish disappears because you HAVE to set it or else it'll be gone in 10 minutes. I digress. This is a liquid to powder formula, a very forgiving and easy combo to work with.  And yes, it's long-lasting. On a normal day (say, 8hrs), it will last through almost anything you need. I sleep in it on some busy days, and in the morning, a good amount is still left over after 24hrs. This is coming from someone who only looks for long-lasting blushes and somehow they always last 5 hours max...   Extra info: I don't use foundation and I have some slight texture on my cheeks. The pigmentation is so strong on its own that I don't need a blank slate for it to pop. I live in a dry, hot climate but I have combo skin, so products do tend to disappear on me. The color I got was Dope, and I used my own dollar bills...  So yeah, no false advertising here."

It applied well, 2 dots covered what I expected from using cream blushes before. Maybe it is because it is a blurring blush, but I don't really care for how it sat on my skin. Without a powder blush on top it didn't seem to marry with my skin well and was more sitting on top.  It had a nice staying power and my sensitive skin didn't react at all, which is nice.

I donu2019t even understand how but it makes the skin look velvety almost powdered down to blur and minimize the look of pores. And it was super lightweight on the skin! My only thing is that the shades are all more ashy and cool toned. I chose the shade zen which seems to be the most warm but it was still quite light and pasty on my medium warm skin tone. Please come out with more shades! The formula is amazing"

The formula is super creamy and blends effortlessly into the skin, giving a natural, blurred finish. The color is buildable, so you can keep it subtle or go bold. I love how it instantly adds a healthy flush without looking cakey. Perfect for first-time users, itu2019s a great option if you want a fresh, radiant glow that lasts all day!"
