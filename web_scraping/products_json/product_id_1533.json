I just ordered another batch of 4 and they are all dry as a bone. They seem completely dried out. They go on super scratchy and the result looks terrible, like a little kid did my eyeliner. They are all like this, it wasn't just one in the batch, so I'm returning them. Just wanted to warn anyone else who was thinking about buying or rebuying, this is not the same product that it was 6 months or a year ago."

Liner stays on all day through tears and hikes without budging or smearing onto hooded eyelids and it comes off relatively easily with warm water and coconut oil."

When trying to go back to shore, a large wave hit my kayak and I fell out, sunk underwater with the kayak skimming over my head. I was continuously knocked over by waves until I finally made it to land.  When I checked my reflection later, my eyeliner was STILL perfect.

Now I'm in my early 30s and at some point I switched over to brush tip liquid liner pens, which I still use pretty consistently to date...at least until I received the Stila Stay All Day Liquid Eyeliner Voxbox and fell in love all over again!   Not only is this liquid liner pen super precise drawing super fine lines, but it's also super pigmented leaving the perfect black line. I still rock the cat eye and I now use a different drawing technique which i hadn't previously used with the Stila when I used it before.. And wow it really did make the perfectly fine wing on the first try.   When I first opened this box, I was slightly bummed that it was a product already well known to me... But now that I'm using it again, Stila is right back in the rotation and I'm so happy to have discovered it again!"

I can easily use the point to create a thin cat eye or lay the tip at an angle to create a thicker line. I tested the waterproof claim on a recent ski trip. It did fade and break up a bit on one eyelid as my eyes were really watery with the cold. However, it did hold up in the  steam room and hot tub! It applies smoothly without tugging and dries down quickly to a matte black. I would recommend this liquid eyeliner as it is easy to use and cruelty free."

I now, apparently, have very oily eyelids, which I didn't even realize was a thing until it became my nuisance. My eyeliner now wants to stamp itself on my upper lid when my eyes are open, the inner and outer corners run and smear like no other, and my norm had become looking like a raccoon within a few hours of applying makeup. I have been on the search for my Holy Grail eyeliner, one that actually stays put, can combat oil and sweat, and doesn't give me insane dark circles. Well lucky for me, I received the Stila Stay All Day Waterproof liner recently, and I can't lie. I expected it to fail me after a few hours, because literally everything else had up to that point. When I tell you that this eyeliner does not move, it does not move. Even with my oily eyelids, at the end of the day the color of my wings seems less intense compared to initial application, but even so, it has not moved. This is huge for me! I actually tested this on the back of my hand, and it stayed put through 2 whole days of frequent hand washing. I even rubbed coconut oil across this eyeliner when on my hand, and it barely moved. As an added bonus, this felt tip is super sharp and can give you crisp, thin lines, or thicker, bolder lines. Ladies, this is the one. I don't think I'll ever go back to another liner unless I can find something to top it, and after all the products I've tried, that's going to take some work! Just get the eyeliner. You won't regret it!"

The finish is impressive u2013 a rich, intense black that adds a striking definition to my eyes.  One of the most commendable aspects of this eyeliner is its exceptional longevity. True to its name, it indeed stays all day without smudging or running. I've worn it through long days and even sweaty workouts, and it remains intact, maintaining its intense color without any smudging or flaking. Its waterproof formula is reliable, ensuring that it stays put regardless of weather conditions.  Despite its fantastic performance, I must note that some individuals with sensitive eyes might experience slight irritation. Additionally, the price is higher compared to other eyeliners, but the quality and durability justify the cost.  Having experienced its reliability and impressive performance firsthand, I would absolutely purchase and highly recommend the Stila Stay All Day Liquid Waterproof Eyeliner. Its ease of application, long-lasting formula, and smudge-proof nature make it a worthwhile investment for anyone seeking a dependable eyeliner that delivers both style and durability."

Very happy with this, which is a pleasant surprise because I had very low expectations with how much I dislike using liquid eyeliner."

I have tried both smoky quartz and midnight blue, and both are extremely dry and therefore a lot more difficult to apply / draw lines.

I am an eye liner junkie so I have high expectations when it comes to color, intensity, smudging, long lasting etc etc. The Stila stay all day liquid lipstick is very black which I like. It has a felt tip eye liner and I found it extremely easy to use. I was able to line my top lash line and create a wing easily. The tip of the liner is perfect for winged liner. It lasted all day on me and did not smudge at all. At the end of the night I used oil free makeup remover and it came off easily! The only gripe I have is that you canu2019t put it on your water line. Overall I highly recommend."

I applied a tiny bit of water on my eyelid, as if I had a teary eye and it smudged almost completely right away. For me, it acts more like a regular eyeliner. I get teary eyes from allergies so itu2019s important for my eyeliner not to smudge. But if your eye is dry and you accidentally rub it, it wonu2019t budge, so thatu2019s good! 3/5 for me.

The color is a beautiful rich black ( sometimes liquid liners dry funky colors ). It lasts all day, doesnu2019t smudge, doesnu2019t flake, doesnu2019t smear. I love it. Iu2019m a busy mom on the go and I donu2019t have time to constantly be fixing my eyeliner so this is an awesome choice! I definitely recommend to all my cat eye girlies!"

The first impression is that the product is packaged extremely carefully with 2 layers of thick paper protecting the product - this makes me impressed and extremely excited. The product design is simple and easy to hold like a pen. The strokes are thin so drawing the corners of the eyes is extremely easy. It's advertised as waterproof, but I easily wipe the ink off with my hand, so I'm a little disappointed. However, I think this product is worth a try.

Itu2019s very quickly dried, and it doesnu2019t bleed or look messy at all. It makes very clean straight lines and itu2019s just what I need! some of these products that are Wet liquid eyeliners tend to bleed or not come out as theyu2019re supposed to leaving me having to reapply over and over and in this case I didnu2019t need too! The color is very bold which I love I love the fact that itu2019s very intense black. Itu2019s very noticeable and very very nice color and very bold and rich. I would definitely recommend this I myself love black eyeliner, and the fact that itu2019s waterproof and doesnu2019t smear, and it lasts throughout the day is great. I actually used it for Thanksgiving, which just passed, and I had no issues with that at all! all day on, and it was all good nothing to worry about so I would definitely recommend this. I think Stila is a great brand they make top quality products that are premium and I think theyu2019re necessary for people that like to look good and feel theyu2019re using some thing of good quality. Sometimes quality is better than buying multiples in quantity because itu2019s more affordable..  if you want something that will last throughout the day. This will last, and youu2019ll be able to take on the day without having worrying about reapplying, which after a day with other eyeliners you tend to sometimes  need to so this is a good option. The color is very intense and bold which is great itu2019s definitely black. The lines come out  perfect. It goes on smooth not having to constantly reapply or coat over and over and itu2019s very lightweight and no irritation to the eye ."

            "review_text": "Fantastic eyeliner that came highly recommended and for a good reason: it lasts over 12 hours on me without any smudging or transfer, regardless of how hot or humid my surroundings are (must be applied to completely dry skin, otherwise it will transfer) and yet somehow still easy to remove at the end of the night with nothing other than just a cotton pad and micellar water. Goes on slightly shiny but dries down quickly to a semi matte, however still giving me enough time to easily wipe-off any occasional mishap. The flexible felt tip applicator dispenses exactly the amount of product needed in a controlled manner and is versatile enough to create a thin line or a thicker one - if you wish to build up without the risk of flaking. This has never flaked on me once! Also no issues with the tip fraying despite going through several of these in the last few years, maybe it's a 'wear and tear' issue and I'm just not using often enough to experience that problem? The cap is also very secure so no risk of this drying out It's also one of the very few liquid eyeliners that doesn't cause my eyes to sting and water as I've reacted badly to most brands that I've used in the past. I have this in both 'Carbon Black' and 'Alloy' shades and love them both.

The pigment is unparalleled, each stroke applies evenly, and it doesn't fade or smudge throughout the day or evening.   The quality is well worth the price, and it doesn't run out as quickly as other liners I've used. I use this liner pretty much every day, and it usually lasts at least 2 months. It can seem like it's running low before then, but 9/10 times giving it a good shake is all it needs. I get compliments on my liner all the time, and every time I've recommended this liner to someone it always amazes them!  It has a few small flaws. It can get a little smudgy around my tear ducts, but only right after application. When it's starting to run out, the tip can get a bit frayed so it's not as easy to get a sharp line, but that's pretty standard for a liquid liner with a felt tip. The only improvement I could think of would be a grip to make it easier to hold while applying."

It will stay all day if youu2019re skiing, walking to and from work on a rainy fall day, or experiencing humidity in the south. I even applied it before a 12 hour trans-pacific flight, and my wings looked just as good when I landed. The pens also last a long time. I apply it almost every day and donu2019t run out quickly.

Any time I want wings or cat eyes (so like every day let's be honest lol), this is the one I reach for. I switched to this eyeliner a couple years ago from the KVD Inked Liner--I loved the applicator on that but it was bad about flaking later in the day. Before that, I was using Lancome Artliner which I loved for the saturated color but would run as the day progressed. The Stila eyeliner has everything I loved about the others--the saturation, the great applicator, and easy, smooth lines but with actual staying power. If you're on the fence about trying this eyeliner, DO IT!   FYI, I do typically pair this up with the Urban Decay eye primer to help lock it in place."

I have been using this for 6-7+ years (can't even remember because it's been so long) and it is honestly the best. The pen isn't stiff, it's easy to get a good precise line. I also love that the formula doesn't dry out super quick! I don't wear makeup everyday but this liner lasts me for at least 6+ months, I typically purchase maybe 2 per year. The only concern is that I have a monolid and if I blink, sometimes it could transfer to other areas as it doesn't dry down super fast, but I think that's just a personal issue I have with it due to my eye shape. It lasts all night and doesn't transfer, it's also a true black in color! It is not patchy at all. I also love that this doesn't irritate my eyes! Honestly, hands down my ride or die liner, I don't think I'l ever find anything better!"

Secondly, the color is rich and it applies beautifully and evenly. It does not dry out like other liner's I have used. Thirdly, it has a long shelf life and it lasts a long time on your face. It is waterproof.   Here are the cons: It smudges if you aren't careful. It's not hypoallergenic. The felt tip eventually dries out. It is a higher price than a lot of liners.   I think in my opinion this is one of the best liners at sephora and on the market. However don't get it if you have watery eyes or allergies."

It has just the right thickness and firmness in the tip. I store this upside down in my brush cup because it seems to stay wet that way.   BIG disclaimer: this product is amazing, but ONLY if you get it in the intense black shade. Every other shade Iu2019ve tried is AWFUL. Iu2019m talking, will-be-dry-and-dragging-within-a-couple-uses awful. I absolutely do NOT recommend this if you are not getting intense black. That being said, if you need a good BLACK eyeliner for oily lids, get this. (Note: I do use this over Narsu2019 eyeshadow primer)."

I'm glad I tried it! Applies easily, dries quickly. Make sure to apply in good lighting to ensure its as dark as you'd like it, as you will probably have to go over it to get it opaque. I have hooded eyes and oily skin (and I can't be bothered to be touching up makeup all day lol) so staying power is a must. It stays on all day with zero transfer. And comes off easily with makeup remover when you want it to! (Also for the record, I do a dramatic, edging on Amy Winehouse cat eye and Stila has been great.)

Looks great immediately after applying, but will transfer onto your eyelid and smudge all over the place within an hour. Iu2019ve done my best to apply carefully and allow it to dry well with my eyes closed, tried different styles of wing to see if certain shapes would hold up better, neutralized oil on my lids with powder, etc, etc, and nothing makes this problem go away.

I had been using Benefit's Roller Eyeliner for a while before, so I'm a bit spoiled by the fast drying and soft nib.  Stila's SAT liner takes a bit longer to dry down and has a sharper, less flexible nib, but is overall much more saturated in color and pretty comfortable to wear.  And this stuff does NOT budge!  It comes off easily with cleansing oil, but other than that it sticks where you put it!  The nib doesn't bend and leaves a great sharp line for winged liner, and the formula isn't sticky or strange feeling on the lids.  Will definitely purchase again and suggest, just wish it was a bit softer/more flexible, but that's a personal thing for me!"

Not only is this not waterproof, it's gummy when dry, and patchy as all heck. You have to press the tip down very hard to get any actual pigmentation, and unless you do your eyeliner in one perfect swoop, it will dry too fast and the tip will literally take the previously applied liner off. You can also just touch it briefly 10 mins after applying and it pills off in patches.   I don't know if sephora messed up and sent me an expired one (as I also received broken products in the same order) or if the liner is just trash in this color, but it's a complete waste of money. Wish I could return it,  but timing wise I messed up. I'm just going to buy another NYX one and never buy a stila liner again lol."

When I tell you I bought this and it SLID across my lid so perfectly, the felt tip is the best Iu2019ve used (and Iu2019ve tried ALOT of brands over the years). The best most long lasting eyeliner Iu2019ve ever used.  Iu2019m now on my third one! Iu2019ll never go back. $30 is steep for an eye liner but this lasts me about a year with daily use! I first tried this in 2018 for reference. My other liners would only last maybe 6 months.. almost as if they dried up, not that I used up all the product..  any way if youu2019re thinking about buying this, do it. Itu2019s worth it."

The ink only saturates the bottom half of the felt pen part and doesn't reach to the tip. The tip is SO flimsy and does not draw, in fact, when you try and make a wing, the flimsy and dry tip actually removes the ink deposited with the lower part of the pen. I'm going back to the KVD tattoo liner and I will definitely never purchase this again!"
