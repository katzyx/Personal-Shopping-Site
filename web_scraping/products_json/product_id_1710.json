On first spray, it is very sweet, I get the creamy floral notes right away and it's the perfect bomb affect that all the flowerbomb fragrances have. But when it dries down, the florals give away to the vanilla and patchouli, and it does have a honeyish candied aroma. This is definitely the most unique perfume I've smelled. The longevity is about 6-7 hours on my skin."

Iu2019ve asked and my partner doesnu2019t smell it, I assume itu2019s a proximity to nose thing when itu2019s first exposed to oxygen.  Even 7 hours later and my skin smells and tastes sweet like a warm fizzy pear. I donu2019t love buying expensive perfumes but this scent is so unique, and the bottle I purchased in August is still half full (today is December 2nd). Itu2019s worth it for me."

I knew I already loved the other 2, and Iu2019d been just dying to finally try Nectar! Iu2019d heard so many incredible reviews of it! Now that I finally have it I have to say that It definitely doesnu2019t disappoint at all! I am just thrilled with it! Iu2019m kind of tied between Nectar and Ruby Orchid as to which is my favorite of the 3u2026 theyu2019re all so good, but those 2 both just have something extra special that the original doesnu2019t! Also, I typically prefer florals for the spring and summer seasons, but I really feel that Nectar works perfectly year round!   Nectar has that floral Flowerbomb base to it, but this one is much more sweet and fruity. The orange blossom note adds a yummy and sweet smell while the vanilla adds a lovely sweetness that warms the fragrance up. Iu2019d say itu2019s the most playful, flirty, and happy of the Flowerbomb fragrances! A grownup, gorgeous, deliciously sweet, fruity floral that belongs in everyoneu2019s collection!"

It can be worn year round and still smell appropriate for the season - cozy and warm in the winter but equally bright and punchy in the summer.

Like Killian Love Donu2019t Be Shy and incense.  The dry down is soft, cool incense and a hint of vanilla.    I find this has moderate projection, and it wears close.  Even with 3 sprays, I find this subtle.  Maybe I am noseblind to this fragrance a bit, as it is so familiar.  Plus, I am used to the powerful sillage of Dior Addict, which I never ever used more than 1 spray of.  That stuff is powerful, Flowerbomb Nextar is  more subtle and close.  Longevity is moderate.  Sillage moderate.    I donu2019t find this fruity or overly sweet, or metallic.  Incense and sweetness that dries down to rich and soft incense.  Worth trying, but not a safe blind buy for most I think.  Took me a few days to warm up to it, but now I appreciate it.  Not likely to replace Addict for me though."

I was worried about the gun powder note, however Iu2019m happy to report I donu2019t really smell it. Maybe I smell a slight deepness or smokiness but I couldnu2019t pick it out if I didnu2019t know it was in there. I say try Nectar if you wanted to like Flowerbomb but felt it was too sharp and had too much Patchouli. The OG gives me migraine but this is much better. It has awesome projection and longevity and I only need 1 spray max on my neck/chest. Anything more I would choke myself out from the sweetness."

I never bought the full bottle but I would rotate wearing this and Kilian Princess while I was at work (I ended up buying princess). I was surprised when my bf gifted me a bottle of this he said it reminded him of me and it was an instant love again. I love orange blossom and vanilla in fragrance and this has both.  I prefer my sweet scents to have something to kick the sweetness or a hint of something spicy, in this itu2019s the metallic note. Itu2019s perfectly blended yet Iu2019m able to distinguish some of the notes. Orange blossom lightens the syrupy sweet vanilla notes and the gunpowder gives the top notes a bit of an edge, while the patchouli in the base mixes well with the vanilla to keep it from getting sickly sweet. I would almost think this perfume has fruity notes to it. it smells like you took some fresh & ripe berries, a squeeze of orange juice and vanilla and heated that up and reduced to a syrup. Thatu2019s exactly what this sweetness smells like to me. The added notes of gunpowder and patchouli keep this from staying just a jammy sweet fragrance. I donu2019t think itu2019s a good blind buy just bc itu2019s SO sweet and I know some people donu2019t like the metallic note. For me itu2019s very wearable day, night, summer, winter etc. It lasts for weeks on clothing and literally all day on skin and my skin eats up fragrance. The performance on here is one of the best of designer fragrances."

In my opinion, it beats FLOWERBOMB I know right, but something about that gun powder, Iu2019m not sure, but this stuff right here will get you anybody and anything you WANT!! Itu2019s pricey, but worth every penny!!! Good gracious I could go on and on how much I love this! I am a u201cWarm floral/Earthy/Gourmand kinda person, and this just blew me away. This is me in a bottle. Iu2019ve always said u201cBlack Opiumu201d was? Well, it still is, but now I have another one! I mean Iu2019m not playing. Run, donu2019t walk, run and go buy this if you love Flowerbomb. I got the 1.7 oz for 130$ and it was worth every penny. When I get 170 guess what? Iu2019m getting that one too!! This is amazing!! 3 sprays behind your ears, neck, wrists, and of course your clothes, and people will follow you around like a lost puppy dog. I finally got it yu2019all. I have zero regrests. This is perfection in a bottle. This is better the few. This is better than midnight Bloom. This is BETTER THAN THE OG FLOWERBOMB!! How?!! I need to know the answers to these questions!"

I get so much cotton candy from this but a mature cotton candy not childish. I am a gourmand lover if you love sweet scents you need to try this one . It is very strong and long lasting I can smell it all day long I would say lasting power is 10/10 maybe 9 hours ? Itu2019s the most long lasting perfume I have.

It is an overly sweet synthetic scent that ruined the parfum for me. I tried applying it again after I showered, thinking that maybe on clean skin with no lotion it might help. No - the florals changed again to a synthetic smell. The nectar must be the issue in this (with me anyway). I will stick to the original."

I get compliments daily, men especially seem to adore the sweet, almost fruity floral scent. It lasts, I spray my brush and bring it through my hair as well as on my skin, the fragrance never changes. 10/10, I will continue to repurchase as my signature scent. I keep my full size at home and have two travel sizes for on the go, wonu2019t be without!"

Itu2019s sweet but itu2019s got a little hint of citrus added to it to bring it a little closer to the u201cfreshu201d side vs the u201cfloral vanillau201d side. Donu2019t get me wrong, itu2019s still got the floral & vanilla but they arenu2019t so strong and in your face as the original. The original is more basic where this to me is more fresh, sexy. Itu2019s very similar to Black Opium to me but I would say this one is the daytime, year round version of Black Opium (which has the spicy, nighttime, Winter vibe). If you like Black Opium I think you would like this. There are things very common between the two."

I sprayed a little on each wrist, smelled the left one first, and thought: kind of sweet, but refreshing too.  Then I smelled the right wrist and thought: wait a minute.  This one smells different!  How is that possible?  It was warmer, more mellow.  I figured it was just me, so I got my husband to smell each wrist in turn, and he said, I like the second one better.  He couldn't believe they came from the same bottle! So...while I don't quite get it, I will definitely be getting some more, as I loved every scent within this scent!"

It lasts fairly long, but nothing too impressive. I notice it wearing off after about 3 hours, but I will say it lasts MUCH longer on clothes. Even one spritz on my top and it lasts the whole day.

It has everything I like about the original Flowerbomb, but goes deeper into a sweet/sugary scent rather than floral. It is a very classy, feminine, and sexy perfume. I wish I could give it 6 stars! It has become my new go-to, and it LASTS all day! (For scent reference, I tend to go for perfumes that are sweet, vanilla-y, warm, and sometimes with a hint of spice. My other favourites include Prada Candy, Comptoir Sud Pacifique in Vanilla Extreme, La Vie Est Belle, and Pink Sugar. If you enjoy any of those, then you will love this perfume too!)."

Sat the card on my dresser and I noticed a wonderful smell when walking past the dresser, but it did not pervade the whole room.  I am very sensitive to fragrance and usually buy a rollerball or travel size of a fragrance first, to make sure it agrees with me, however this is not available in a pocket size.  To my surprise, the large Sephora in the mall actually gives fragrance samples by pouring some into a tiny spray dispenser.  I sat this on my dresser, as the original card wore off pretty quickly, and noticed an amazing raspberry like scent whenever I walked by.  When I spritz it on my wrists, however, I seem to get more of the gunpowder scent than the underlying gourmand notes that I love so much.  So two samples, both which gave off alluring but not overpowering scents while just sitting in place, but with different notes depending on the delivery system.  Neither of those yummy notes were primary when worn on my skin however.  Also, it wore off rather quickly when two spritzes were placed on wrists and rubbed together.  So IDK if the differing performance was due to the different delivery methods and might differ still when used directly from a retail bottle, so I am in a conundrum.  It is not inexpensive, and I donu2019t wear perfume regularly, just on evenings out.  I donu2019t want to smell like gunpowder, and I am not sure why it was added to the product, I assume to balance the sweetness.  But it is the sweetness that I prefer, whether the Tonga bean/vanilla notes from the cardboard sample, or the raspberry/fruity notes from the sample bottle.  Also, it really wore off quickly, which would be extremely disappointing if the notes I loved were prominent.  I guess the answer is to try and get back to a store and spritz it directly from bottle to body.  Probably not a good idea to order online."

After leaving I kept thinking about this scent and decided I wanted to get it, and it has become my favorite sweet, floral scent.  I bought the original Flowerbomb about a year and a half ago, but ended up returning it the same day unopened for the Chloe perfume; I tried both on in store and found I preferred the Chloe as I did the rest of my shopping.  I definitely prefer this to the original Flowerbomb, although at this point I wouldn't have a distinct memory of the scent of it.  In comparison to Chloe, this has almost more of a sugary scent, which sounds kind of weird, but ends up smelling like flower-y candy on the skin.  I would highly recommend!"

It is a strong smell where one application was enough to keep the smell on me all day. It is a good autumn/going into winter scent as it is sweet/smooth yet has that spice to help transition seasons. The only downside was the price of $150 for only a 50ml. But I guess since it is very concentrated you need to apply only 1 squirt for the entire day."

I guess something changes with age because I was a die hard Marc Jacobs Daisy girl for 5 years and since last year Iu2019ve been on the hunt for a new fragrance. Not knowing whether I wanted a similar floral bright scent like MJ Daisy or something brand new, I started branching off into warmer scents. Enter V&R Flowerbomb Nectar! I got a sample scent with one of my online orders and I couldnu2019t stop thinking about it! The price kept me at bay for a while, so I went to Sephora and spritzed myself with Flowerbomb Nectar and just wore it, testing out the longevity, how it plays off my body pH, and how husband likes it. I did this twice and ended up purchasing!! It lasts all day. Itu2019s warm, sweet and sensual. I love it. My husband loves it."

Itu2019s indescribable u2013sweet yet musky, sultry yet soft = itu2019s a very alluring scent with good staying power. I think the attraction for me is the gunpowder accord that it contains. Iu2019m drawn to musky fragrances and it doesnu2019t hurt that the scent also contains jasmine (love). I hope they expand the line to include a body lotion/creme, shower gel or a dry oil.
