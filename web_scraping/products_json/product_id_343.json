It seems to work pretty well - lots of brands make my scalp itchy or oily throughout the week but this one so far hasn't (and it's been 5 days). Well it is occasionally itchy but not too bad (unlike other shampoos I've tried)!   (I was gifted by Davines in exchange for an honest review!)"

            "review_text": "Hey beauties! ud83cudf38 Today, I want to share my experience with the Davines Nou Nourishing Purple Shampoo, a gem I've recently discovered that has transformed my hair care routine. **u2728 Yellow Neutralization:** This purple shampoo is perfect for those of us who struggle with unwanted yellow tones in our blonde, grey, or highlighted hair. From the first use, I noticed how my hair took on a cooler, more vibrant tone. **ud83dudca7 Deep Hydration:** What I love most about this product is its ability to nourish and hydrate. Unlike other toning shampoos that can dry out your hair, Davines Nou leaves my hair super soft and manageable. **ud83cudf43 Natural Ingredients:** With a formula enriched with natural ingredients, this shampoo takes care of our hair without using harsh chemicals."

The first thing I noticed was the luxurious lather and the delightful scent, which made my shower feel like a spa experience. After just one wash, my hair felt noticeably smoother and more manageable. Over time, Ive observed a significant reduction in frizz, and my hair looks shinier and healthier. The natural ingredients in the formula make it gentle yet effective, making it a new staple in my hair care routine. Highly recommended for anyone looking to tame unruly hair and achieve a sleek, polished look!"
