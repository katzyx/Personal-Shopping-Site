BUT the colour, ease of application, and that highlighter shade!!! more than make up for it. It's nice to just look nice and not have a face like a glitter bomb went off close by. You can keep this nice and subtle, and use it with or without a base. Primer is highly recommended to extend wear time, but even if that's not your thing, I simply reapply once in a while. It takes two seconds, and it's too pretty for me to care about an occasional touch up on bare skin. The older I get, the more the old touch up makes more sense. For my own skin, well-done makeup and nice healthy-looking results don't always fall into the 24-hour wear category. Once I made peace with that, makeup life got much more pleasant again."

The formula of both the blush and illuminator are super creamy and easy to work with. They are buildable for your choice of a softer or more intense look. Itu2019s better to blend with your fingers so the formula can melt in your skin. Pilling occurs if you have any products underneath which is why I dropped a star. I tend to use this as a u201cno make upu201d makeup look without foundation to give me some color and life back into my face. I wouldnu2019t use the illuminator if you arenu2019t a fan of your skinu2019s texture, the cream definitely highlights the skins texture and makes it look more noticeable. I would recommend this to my friends who are looking to add some color back to the face. I also used the blush on my lips to pair them. Doubles as a lipstick. I have added two photos, one is my before photo, the next is after application of both blush and illuminator. I have no other products on my cheeks."

I think the blush is a beautiful flush on my skin that resembles a pinky/mauve color. I tried applying the blush both with my fingers and a stippling brush. My fingers helped to melt the products and apply more smoothly. The color did fade throughout the day. The highlighter side is definitely a more natural effect. If I wear a highlighter I usually reach for something with a more white/yellow gold tone to help brighten. I felt like this highlighter never truly dried down. The only reason I chose to review this with less stars was due to longevity of the blush without a powder blush on top and tacky/wetness of the highlighter without a powder highlighter topper as well. I think this would work best for those wanting a really dewy look or for u201cno makeup, makeupu201d type of days."

The color was perfect, it literally lasts ALL DAY, and I love the highlighter. The cream blush is wonderful and easy to apply. For me, it's perfect. I switched to cream blush a while ago because I am a little on the dry side and powder blush literally disappears after an hour or two. This blush stays on all day which is AMAZING!! I can't say enough good things about it and I would highly recommend. I know it is a little pricey, but it seems to contain a good amount of product, so it should last for quite a while."

The natural finish is one of the aspects that I love the most, the blush looks so natural and the highlighter looks like it illuminates from within, both are pigmented and super buildable.  The convenience is another super plus, it's perfect for on-the-go and quick retouches, reason why this is one of those perfect products that everyone needs, even on those days that I don't wear makeup, I use a tinted spf, or serum and swipe this duo on key areas, the blush is also really nice on the lips, and the highlighter goes perfect right under the eyebrows.   It's definitely one of my favorite makeup products so far, and I know it will remain that way for years to come. I already bought it in the coral shade and it's equally stunning!"

The color stayed on my cheeks all day and did not irritate my skin.  I actually used the illuminator on my eyes, as the color, nude glow, is very similar to the shade I use for my daily eyeshadow.  I really liked how it reflected light yet still looked natural.  I was able to use eyeliner on top of it without smearing.  Both products came off easily at night with regular soap and water.  Its a great addition to my makeup arsenal and makes my routine so much easier!"

The packaging is classy and is of great quality. The shimmery highlighter is a beautiful mix of sparkle and sheen and makes my cheekbones really pop! The opposite side that contains the blush is a really pretty color that I also use as lipstick. The formula texture is creamy and goes on smoothly and lasts for a while. I definitely recommend this product to anyone who is lookin to simplify their beauty routine!"

You can blend this down to be this gorgeous berry glow that looks like you just worked out (ha!) and have that healthy flush. I am a one and done kind of makeup girl. I own sooo much, too much makeup but the things I always reach for are like this. You can do your whole face with this. Now that monochromatic is in- use this on your lips cheeks and eyes and oh did I add there is a stunning nude champagne highlighter on the other side not a wasteful brush like other stick highlighters I own. And you can use it highlight your cheek bones or eyelids.. itu2019s a perfect size to throw in a clutch for summer nights or also something that would be a great beach bag item. Everything is cream and so moisturizing it looks really natural and glowing on your skin. If my step dad didnu2019t just pass away and I wasnu2019t having to help my mom out Iu2019d be purchasing the coral today and then all of them! Also at 44 and a half I really care what I am putting on my skin, and I am think wanders products are made with health skincare and the environment in mind. This is a win for me!
