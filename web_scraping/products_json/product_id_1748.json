If you have a truly pale skin tone, i highly suggest not buying this blush, specifically shade coquette. i can see how some people would like this blush if they fo"

I am not a fan of clean beauty, and I had purchased this in another color (petal) that ended up being warmer than expected, so I returned it. This is a beautiful, sophisticated formula and a beautiful color for fair, cool/neutral skin. I love the luxe magnetic packaging, and the color payoff is actually nice and buildable. It is not greasy at all, and it can be applied directly to the skin and blended out with my fingers. The only issue I have is that I have so much makeup that I'm afraid this will go bad before I finish it, and with it being a limited edition color, I can't even replace it, should I want to. This is the only color that appeals to me in the line, unfortunately. I think the people who say theirs smelled bad are right, such is the issue with clean beauty preservative systems, and I only got this because it was new stock. Mine smells fine (for now) - hopefully it stays that way for a while!"

First saw this blush on Youtube channels and people like Nikki La Rose and Lisa J spoke really highly about this particular blush and shade. It is definitely a good quality blush, it blends well, the color is pretty. And I will definitely use it up with no complaints, but I don't think it is unique or necessarily worth its price in any way. The packaging is on the luxe side, and feels heavy. If you like to treat yourself, go for it. If you are expecting something super ground breaking, this is not it. I also think in terms of color and texture it is very similar to Honest Beauty's cream blush in Rose Pink. That blush is fraction of the price but wears and looks basically identical."

I love it!   I've only tried the shade petal so far, and it's just the most perfect natural looking flush that would work on most skin tones. It's just the right level of pigmented - not so pigmented that it's difficult to blend, and pigmented enough to have noticeable colour. It blends like a dream and has a very beautiful, natural looking satin finish. Not matte, but not shiny either.  Granted I haven't been wearing it every day, but I don't think this product has bothered my skin at all or broken me out. The packaging is also super nice and has a really luxe feel to it - it's heavy, and the magnetic lid is a nice touch. My one gripe is the price - it's just a lot of money for the amount of product. Is it SO much better than any other cream blush that you must absolutely pay the price for this one? No, it's definitely a luxury purchase. I'm not sure if I'll repurchase or not. I do really like that it's skincare oriented blush (which most aren't) and done well, but it is worth the premium for that? Idk."

I am obsessed with the shade Poppet so much but I doubt I'll try other shades. The pigmentation and uniqueness of the color are part of why I love it, but some of the more neutral colors don't feel like they would be worth it to me. Here's why: I was honestly having buyer's remorse about purchasing such an expensive blush, not really intending to use it also as a lippie, since rarely do these types of 2-in-1 products actually work out the way I think they will. Usually, the color and/or consistency are great on one, and bad on the other. I also wasn't expecting the consistency to be something that actually stayed on long enough to wear on my lips. Well, here we are, with me loving a product that I'm still mad about the price of :)  This shade is *gorgeous* on my cheeks and lips and stays on my lips WAY longer than I thought it would. Something so creamy usually flies right off my lips the second I take a sip of coffee, but this stuff sticks around! It doesn't have the staying power of, like a true matte lipstick, but I didn't expect it to and that's not how it's marketed. I'm more shocked at how well it leaves a little blur or color, well after it should have come off. Here's where the cost/shade becomes really important for me - because the shade adds a nice wash of color to my lips and I just don't think any of the shades would show up very well. If I want to use it as both lip/cheek, it has to be a brighter shade. Anything more neutral would just only show up on my cheeks and its wayyyyy to expensive to just be a blush. If It didn't stay as well on my lips, I'd be returning. Bonus points for the magnetic lid (why don't we have more of those!?!) but minus one star for the amount of product - the tube can (and should) hold way more, given the price and honestly it feels rude to charge that much for such a small amount when the tube holds double."

I have very fair, cool-toned skin and am usually the second palest color in most foundations.  Petal oxidized on me and took on a peach tone..  I also had to use a lot to get any color payoff.  I'll try Poppet.  If you are fair like me, do not assume that a paler color will be the right choice.  It's only the right choice if you want a barely-there kind of look, which if you have more natural color than me might work fine.  On me, petal made me look like a vampire. Color aside, I thought this seemed slightly patchy on my combo skin. I'll try the color Poppet and see if I do better with that.  I like the ease of the stick, so debating if I can make this work for me with a different brush."

I find it pretty long lasting even without setting with loose powder or a powder blush, but setting it does make it last even longer.

It's crazy. This blush is so highly pigmented and it lasts ALL DAY. All. Day. I haven't used one single other blush since I bought this and while other reviews say there isn't much product I can tell that even with daily use this stick will last me a year. Full disclosure I won't be using it as a lip product, only blush. If you buy it I highly recommend using a fluffier blush brush.

It looks intimidating, but I believe this color would be flattering on most if not all skin tones.  The formula is dewy but not overly dewy. It's very flattering. My mom loves it so much I got her Dou Dou (heeheehee) as part of Christmas. I want to get Petal for myself during the next sale.

The color options are appealing, but the color I have--Petal--described a dusky rose nude of sorts, runs a bit warm for me in person.  Because I don't use setting powder and use a BB cushion and very glow-promoting base products, it's difficult for me to wear blush in general. Though I've found that some blush tints can work over my cushion foundation without removing product, they usually don't last long. (I have yet to go for powder blush, which would be the logical solution, because I find using powder anywhere besides my eye area to prevent smudging does not bode well for my dry skin.)  Anyway, though this blush stick did not remove my foundation, I wasn't a huge fan of the way it played with it. Additionally, the color was a bit to warm for me. The formula seems creamy and nice, and I think this would be well-suited for those who don't use bb cream. I will try this again on a bare skin day, or if I wear actual foundation. Otherwise, I'm sure my sister would be thrilled to be gifted this!  Three stars, mostly because this isn't suitable for me!"

Application is easy, because itu2019s in a stick format. It blends out so easily even just with a finger. The color petal is the perfect tone for a pale person such as myself, but because itu2019s so blendable Iu2019m not afraid to try darker or brighter shades. The finish makes your skin look healthy and youthful. My favorite part is that I am able to wear it on a bare face without it looking out of place. My only issue is that sometimes I forget Iu2019m wearing it and I touch or wipe my face. A layer of powder would probably help with this. I did accidentally get it on my clothes once, but it luckily washed right out. IG @dontwastethemakeup"

Not too bright and not too dull. I think it would compliment a lot of different skin tones too! I love that it's more like a multipurpose stick and it can also be used as an eye shadow or to give you a little color on your lips. It was blendable and easy to build up the color too. You can barely see it in my picture because it was the same day that I was so frustrated with the complexion drops and I forgot to take a picture when I used it again a couple days later. The blush I'll be continuing to use & I would recommend to others."

Or for a quick on the go makeup, I swipe the stick directly to my cheeks and use fingers to blend.  This is the only blush stick that does not remove my base makeup when you swipe the stick directly on the face.  I have fair skin and the color petal works perfect on my face to give a natural glow and pinch of color.

This shade is Chouchette.   I recommend this Westman Atelier product, the Baby Cheeks Blush Stick! It's easy to use and to travel with. The formula feels smooth and supple. Thank you for the opportunity to try it!    P.S. Only when I came to this website for the review did I realize it's also a lip product. I guess since it's called Baby Cheeks Blush... I thought it was cheeks only. But I don't think it's clean enough to smear lip and face product from the same container anyway, so I'll still with this as a blush only."

I received the shade Petal. It is the perfect soft pink. I love this shade because it is great for every day use but you can build color to make your cheeks pop as well. This cream blush blends very nicely and seamlessly so if youu2019re going for a makeup no makeup look then you need this blush. I also used the cream blush on my eyelids and lips but it caused a reaction on my lids. I love the blush but I wouldnu2019t recommend using it on your eyes if you have sensitive skin. I donu2019t usually get a reaction from using products on my eyelids but it might contain an ingredient that shouldnu2019t be applied to the eye area. Also, check my last picture, I included a shot showing how much product is in the tube. The packaging is very deceiving.  For the price there is very little product but I feel itu2019s worth it since the quality of the blush itself is nice. But not everyone wants to pay that much for such little product. I think itu2019s important that we should be able to see exactly how much product is in the tube before we spend our money so I wanted to show you guys. In conclusion, I loved this blush on my cheeks and lips so I would definitely recommend it to everyone!  #complimentary #westmanatelier #vitalskincare #babycheeksblush @Influenster @westmanatelier"

I love the minimalist aesthetic of this so itu2019s beautiful on my shelf, but it also has an easy, magnetic cap which makes opening and closing the container a breeze. The color of this blush - I got Petal - is such a great neutral dusty rose color. A little goes a long way so I canu2019t use much given how pigmented my cheeks are already but it blends in with my natural cheek color so well. I apply this blush under my foundation, in order to even out the pick in my cheeks since the color is blotchy naturally. I also use this product on my eyes and lips.

I do have to use an eyeshadow brush and a lipstick brush to use on my lips and eyes.  The shade I got is - Bichette - red berry. The color is so beautiful, very red and lustrous. The texture is soft, smooth and creamy. The blush is very pigmented.  I have to use just a little dab to get those lovely rose-flushed cheeks. It also has some great ingredients such as Berryflux Vita, Jojoba seed oil, and Vitus Vita fruit extract that helps to add moisture to the skin and make it firmer. The packaging is very cute as it is a tiny stick with a minimalist look. Iu2019m ready to try other shades as well!"

Despite the moisturizing ingredients and the fact that the products are applied directly to the skin like a stick, I am surprised to notice that my foundation was not moved at all. Therefore, there is no need to worry as the blushes do not move any concealers or foundations. For someone who is combination/oily this was a big win! I would definitely recommend!"

The shiny and natural finish is what has me crazy and in love.  Love it and will definitely get it in other shades."

One tiny gripe that I have about it is, when I opened it, the product touched the top of the lid, but thatu2019s not a big deal, because once I used it, it stopped doing that. The color and pigmentation of the blush is absolutely perfect for a dewy look. I love that it blends in seamlessly no matter where I put it, and so far it stays really well. My skin started becoming more dry over the years, so a lot of blush would emphasize my imperfections, but this does not do that. I also love the color I was given. Having a cross between rosy and peach is what I feel looks best on my complexion. I know that whenever I run out of this, Iu2019m running to get more. Iu2019m also debating on purchasing more colors as well."

I think it'll go bad before I get through the whole stick. I bought Poppet about two weeks ago and I can't believe how much better it is than Minette. I understand some of the reviews I've read about this blush now. If each color is vastly different, then maybe some are terrible and some are amazing. Poppet is amazing. Minette is really good but not as good as Poppet.   Poppet is much creamier and the pigment is a lot more saturated than Minette. I've used it 5-6 times since I got it. I tried layering it with a blush from Menagerie cosmetics (Agarita) and together they lasted about ten hours on my face. Poppet lasts about 6 hours on its own before I see noticeable fading. I think it looks really natural on me, not like I'm wearing a ton of blush. At the same time it gives me enough of a flush where I feel like I'm made up. I included a photo of me wearing Poppet. This photo was taken about an hour after application and I used Poppet with all cream products and a very light dusting of powder. I have light/cool/olive skin, which is why this blush doesn't look as bright on me.   I definitely recommend Poppet and Minette but you should definitely read the color-specific reviews for the colors you are interested in since some of them differ!"

The colours are also completely game changing for my makeup routine - I just swipe some of this on and blend and immediately look so much healthier and put together. I have Petal, Chouchette, Dou Dou, Poppet and Bichette. I have light yellow toned skin and I do find Dou Dou is my favourite for being the most wearable but also making a statement. Poppet is also gorgeous for a statement and Bichette is incredibly natural like just after a workout. Petal and Chouchette are less unique but good staple colours. I never intended to purchase so many but they are just too amazing, I had to try almost all colours."

I'm medium to light Asian skin tone and have very dry skin.  The colour only lasted 45 min!! The smell reminded me of rancid grease (probably bc it's all natural).  My fav cream blush is Bobbie Browns coral which i think is discontinued.  If I had to choose between this or Milani cream blush, Milani wins hands down.  Milani has no rancid smell and the colour lasts longer.  If i was to keep this, I would end up going through a stick a month and then tossing out this massive plastic and metal tube which is not recyclable. for clean make up... i find this an oxymoron and you will have to use a lot of product to get any colour therefore going through many tubes of this product vs Milani or bobbi brown.  i want to try Fenty since i hear it has good colour pay off.

This blush provides the perfect amount of color for a u201cno makeup makeupu201d look. It really doesnu2019t even look like youu2019re wearing blush at all but rather that you just have a healthy flush. Normally I go for more red/terracotta colors because of my Olive/medium coloring but I decided to try Poppet based on some YouTube reviews and I have to say itu2019s gorgeous on my skin. I thought the vibrant pink would be too bold but it creates such a natural, healthy look and is a more realistic color for if I were actually blushing. Bichette is simply beautiful too. I can see myself reaching for this product (both colors) for days when Iu2019m not wearing any makeup but need some color (cheeks and/or lips), or for no makeup makeup looks (I never really do heavy or full coverage makeup). Overall, glad I purchased this blush and look forward to using it more and more. Now Iu2019m tempted to branch out to other products from this brand (although my wallet will not be a fan)."

I've had mine for almost a year and I'm not even a quarter of the way through it yet. The color itself is so beautiful on the skin and warms your face up. I highly recommend."

Let me just tell you: After wearing it for the first time, I pretty much ran here to add a positive review because I love this product so much and cannot understand why it isn't rated higher.   I bought the color Poppet, which is the bright pink. I'm about as pale as pale can be with neutral undertones, so I was nervous it might be too overpowering - not so. Poppet leaves the most beautiful healthy looking pink flush, somewhat reminiscent of Bobbi Brown's pale pink powder (which also looks shockingly pink in the pan) I used to use years ago. I think this color could probably flatter any skin tone. I used just one tiny stroke on each cheek, then blended it in easily with my fingers. It is pricey, for sure, but given how little I had to use for one application, I image it will last a long time.  And speaking of price... This stuff feels expensive. Maybe that doesn't matter to some, but if I'm paying for a luxury item, I want it to feel like one. The packaging in weighty and the cap goes on with a satisfying magnetic clasp. Baby Cheeks makes my morning a little more no fuss, but it also makes me feel fancy while using it. Highly recommend!"

Both were easy to use but darker in the packaging and less pigmented so blending is achieved by really spreading out the product, which subsequently leaves lighter patches if your technique isn't perfect. Upon switching to westman atelier the difference is huge. It is very pigmented and does not pull off the cheek when you blend it around. It's effortless and takes less than a minute to apply to perfectly flushed results. If you're like me, and desire the simplest and most effective makeup routine possible, this product is a winner!"

I rarely have this problem with blushu2014cream, powder, or liquidu2014so Iu2019m confused by this one. I love the Poppet color, but it fades away 90% within 4 hours of wear. No point reapplying it since itu2019ll look patchy anyway. Iu2019ve used too many better cream/stick blushes to let Westman Atelier slide in this category, especially at their price point.   I haven't tried using this product on my lips because the color probably wouldn't last an hour there, and it'd feel too drying. I'm giving this product 2 stars for the lovely (though short-lived) color and the fact that it didn't cause a bad skin reaction. But I'm surprised by how badly this blush performs."

My favorites are Dou Dou and Poppy.  Petal is nice but not wow (for me, it didn't add anything to my collection b/c I already have nude pink blushes).  Bichette is warmer, more rust (still a brick red color) than it appears in the photo and swatches.  Poppy is intimidating but blends beautifully and brightens the face.  I like applying these with the Westman Atelier baby cheeks blush, or the Zoeva 110 face brush.  Works well with fingers, too.  The only thing I don't like about this is the packaging. I wish it was a smaller diameter to make it easier to carry and store - the grey tube seems so fact when compared to the stick of blush. The other thing I don't like is that magnetic closure....if you only have one Westman Atelier cheek or face product, I'm sure it is fine...but if you have several products, the magnets will repel each other, so they need to be a few inches apart on top of your vanity.   I also have some of the Merit blushes and I know people are curious about how they compare to the WA blush stick.  The Merit blushes are packaged such that they are smaller and lighter so that's a plus.  I do like the dark berry/red in the Merit line better than Bichette and I think the Merit blushes feel lighter on my skin and they blend out more easily and sheerly.  I have to be much more intentional with the WA and application takes longer.  For the foundation stick, my preference is Merit...but for the blushes, I like all of the above!"

This particular color looks so cute on me. I usually cannot pull off peach blush, but this has enough pink in it that it looks super cute and subtle on me. It's pretty creamy, but I don't apply this directly to my cheeks. I take a brush and use it to pull some product from the stick, and then apply by stippling it on. I then blend with powder and it sets nicely. The longevity of this blush in this color is very good. It wore all day on top of foundation for 8-9 hours and it didn't fade. So, even though this is a pricier blush, it's actually very good. I definitely recommend this color!"

It's expensive, but honestly it lasts forever. I have the colors Petal and now Poppet. I am in love with both, but Poppet is such a stunning color. I was nervous it might be too bright for my light complexion, but it's so stunning. It's the perfect color for summer! This whole line knocks it out of the park, but the blush is in my top 3 for sure. Highly recommend."

It gives me exactly what I was looking for, a hint of color without looking like straight up makeup but still enhancing the cheeks. I popped some on my lips as well, you get two products in one!
