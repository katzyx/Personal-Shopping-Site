I am going to finish it but definitely not going to repurchase. I've tried better products, so will probably go back to what I am used to."

Its very good at removing my makeup, but my face still felt oily after washing, as if the cleanser is too gentle to get rid of oil build up from the day and i feel like my skin is more clogged because of it so I think I will have to try something else."

I think I'm done searching for a better cleanser, this one is my favourite so far... but my biggest wish is that they would minimize the smell! My skin is also less red than it used to be. I teamed up this cleanser with the SOS spray from Tower 28. They are quite a good combo!"

(As you can see my display in the background of my photo) So, when I saw this on my recommended page, I new I had to buy it. When I first used it, my skin felt so soft and amazing, considering I have extremely dry skin. However, as I kept doing my normal routine of this cleanser, I woke up everyday with red, dry, flakey skin matching with hives. After switching up some products in my routine, I realized that the cleanser was the problem. Itu2019s nothing special, honestly you can get a Cera-ve cleanser at your local target for 10$ and get better results. But, I could see why this would be popular.

This will also remove mascara and eye makeup but do expect to follow up with a bit of makeup remover on the eye area. I think expecting a cleanser to remove eye makeup completely is unreasonable.

First, it's cruelty-free! The packaging has a cute, minimalistic look, and it is recyclable, but I might also reuse it as a dish or hand soap or hand sanitizer dispenser. Ingredients are great, and I'm pretty sure they are safe for sensitive skin (my skin isn't really sensitive, but the ingredients don't look like potential irritants. I would still check INCIdecoder, though). I don't use makeup often, but when I do, I feel like this does help to remove it easily without much left behind unless I'm wearing very stubborn mascara. I also feel like it isn't too stripping - this is my MAIN complaint about most cleansers because my skin is so dry and easily dehydrated. If I were to just use this cleanser with no moisturizer, I would say that my skin does feel a TINY bit tight afterwards, but it's so much less than with any other cleanser, and I never cleanse without moisturizing after, anyway. I'm not really sure why the Sephora page says that this is good for redness because I don't notice an improvement in my redness, but it doesn't irritate my skin and make it worse. I also like the smell of it, but I like rose, and I notice people who DON'T like rose REALLY don't like rose, so if that's a smell you dislike, you might hate this cleanser, haha.  TLDR: Cleanses without stripping, although I'm left with a smidgen of tightness if I wait too long to moisturize. Cruelty-free, recyclable, reuse-able. Likely safe for most sensitive skin."

Like another commenter said, I'm not sure why it has a makeup removing claim when it's a terrible makeup remover on a heavy duty, full glam beat. It does a good job at being a simple cleanser though. Also, another thing to keep in mind is the heavy sweet rose scent. I love rose scents but I know people out there DESPISE the smell of rose. However, the scent doesn't linger for too long, especially once you apply your moisturizer. I've been using this for over a year now and my skin feels plump, tightened, and nearly poreless. Another thing to note is that since this is a (low) foaming cleanser it does leave skin feeling a little tight if you don't follow up with a serum and or moisturizer, like any other forming cleanser. To conclude my review, I think this is a good product to take a risk on buying if you're looking for a foaming cleanser but don't want the harsh tightness that usually comes with it. And not that this matters but if you're like me who likes pretty packaging, this bottle has a beautiful aesthetic to it sitting on your sink. It gives a fancy vibe to your beauty space. Hope this helps. Drink your water too!"

This takes off all of my makeup but doesnu2019t leave my skin dry. I mean waterproof mascara, layers of foundation, concealer, primer, powder, blush, highlighter etc itu2019s all gone.     I like to use two pumps with my beauty eraser thoroughly rinse and then Iu2019ll go in again with just one pump to clean up anything left over and it makes me feel extra fresh and still my skin wonu2019t be stripped or squeaky. Itu2019s super gentle and never irritates my skin. It was the only cleanser I was able to use while dealing with extreme dryness while adjusting to a new level of prescription Tretinoin. I love the pretty pink color and the heavy glass jar it comes in. I hate seeing super expensive cleansers in a plastic squeeze tube. This bottle is heavy and the pump works awesome not too much not too little it pumps out the perfect amount and never gets clogged. I think itu2019s reasonably priced itu2019s a little expensive for me definitely one of the more expensive products in my routine but itu2019s so worth it, try it youu2019ll love it."

It is super convenient as I can just remove all of my make up in the shower with this and I don't even have to use cotton pads with eye make up remover first.  Yay for eco friendliness!    I have acne prone/oily skin and this cleanser didn't break me out.  I researched the ingredients before buying and the only thing that might possibly clog pores is the Moringa Oleifera Seed Oil which has a comedogenic rating of 3, but I am thinking because it is so far down the list, it didn't clog up my skin at all.  I'm a bit more sensitive to smells than most people.  The scent is a little funky at first, a little bit like mushrooms and roses (probably due to the fungus extract and rose flower water??)  But it's gentle enough that it doesn't bother me too much.  Hope they don't discontinue this!"

Hope this makes sense!   Itu2019s not terrible but itu2019s not as amazing as I expected it to be. Iu2019m definitely finishing the bottle but I doubt Iu2019ll repurchase.

I wouldnu2019t recommend this to anyone for an acne clearing or oil cutting cleanser as the actives are more simple and soothing than meant to treat anything in specific. Also the smell was definitely not u201croseu201d at first, but its never stopped me from using it and the scent seemed to get better with time. 4 stars because it performed better than expected but Its on par with a lot of my other favorite gel cleansers like the krave one but its a bit more u201cluxuriousu201d and best as a first cleanse imo."

It's a more earthy rose scent, from the rose flower water they use.  Don't go in expecting anything sweet or perfumey (which I dislike).  Scent aside, it's a wonderful cleanser and exactly what I was looking for.  Leaves me feeling clean without feeling tight of stripped.  The nice rose scent, jelly texture, and awesome glass bottle are side bonuses.  I don't wear much makeup, just eye pencil and mascara, and it removed that just fine.  This cleanser heavily reminds me of the Fresh Soy Face cleanser in terms of consistency and cleaning experience, so if you enjoy that cleanser, I'd say try this one out."

Vanicream is $9 I believe at any drug store and is such an effective cleanser with minimal packaging and no fragrance that it has beat out my $30-$100 cleansers over the past few months. I donu2019t mention Vanicream to deter from Herbivore, just noting the formulas are nearly identical, and that I prefer other cleansers to Herbivoreu2019s purely based on cheaper price and effective cleansing abilities. If youu2019re looking to splurge on cleansers, have a pink minimalist aesthetic or try something new this is a great choice - just not one I would repurchase. Best of luck."

I had a small amount of concealer and eyeshadow on one day (that's it!) and I used this in the shower and afterwards I still had most of my makeup on with bioderma on a cotton pad. This does not remove makeup... AT ALL. don't use this to remove makeup unless you want to break out and clog your pores.  My conclusion: This would be a great morning cleanse or cleanse on a day where you didn't do much but want a nice gentle wash... but it definitely does not remove makeup."

It does also smell a little of chemical/acid underneath the Rose, but since this is a face-wash, it doesnu2019t get to stay on the skin and I donu2019t find it too big of a problem. The cleansing experience feels like that of Tatchau2019s exfoliating face wash minus the scrub part, so that is definitely a good thing as Tatchau2019s wash and gel-cream is one of my favs.  This could be used day and night without worrying too much about over-exfoliating. As for the advertised makeup-removing properties, I donu2019t find it that powerful, especially on water-proof makeup and Mascara, so a double-cleanse is required. Minus one star for the underwhelming but stated makeup-removing effects.  If you wear minimal/no makeup, this cleanser could be a 5-star for you."

Micellar waters and cotton rounds just weren't gentle enough for me unless the cotton was completely saturated and dripping, and even then it was annoying to have to keep buying micellar water all the time.   This cleanser is perfect as a makeup remover. It doesn't sting whatsoever and is gentle/hydrating enough for where your skin is thinner and more delicate. It's a small bottle, so I don't think the price would be worth it as a main cleanser, but since I'm only using it as an eye makeup remover or to remove a full face once in a while, the price is justified for me. I don't feel guilty about rubbing my eye area with this cleanser, and it feels amazing."

The smell is a little savory/rose, but it is not strong at all, and there is no added fragrance. This is a low foam cleanser that you apply to wet skin and gently massage to remove makeup, sunscreen, dirt and debris. Most cleansers leave me bright red and stripped but this wonderful cleanser leaves your skin soft and very hydrated. Squalane in the cleanser is responsible for the makeup melting action plus softening/moisturizing.

Its like the other reviewer said about the smell of an old vase of flowers and old water you havenu2019t emptied yet. Kinda reminds me of a bad egg smell too. Other than that, it lathers well, doesnu2019t leave the face feeling tight and dry, it cleanses the skin but I donu2019t feel like itu2019s helped any of my acne or acne scars. I donu2019t feel like it helps with the elasticity of my skin either. Just. O K. Will not repurchase but Iu2019d recommend it for those with sensitive skin."

I can tell I was doing too much to my skin and stripping it, aggravating things making it worse. This calmed all the irritation and clears my pores. You might need a balm or oil cleanser to get makeup off first, or double cleanse if you have makeup on. Also, the smell is like sweet mushrooms, maybe unpleasant to some, but I donu2019t care. Itu2019s way more important to me to not have soft clean skin and this is the only thing that has ever given me that. The only cleanser Iu2019ll use going forward. Thanks to the herbivore sales person that insisted I give it a try and probably saved me a ton more pain <3"

You only need a small amount to generously cleanse your entire face (even the small sample bottle has lasted me weeks). I canu2019t speak to how well it works for removing makeup since I havenu2019t worn makeup lately, but I do use a lot of skincare products (serums/face cream/eye cream/sunscreen/leave-on masks) and this cleanser removes all residue without stripping the skin.

I know it's a jelly cleanser, but the texture is oddly slippery, almost slimy. Hard to describe; kind of felt like it was sitting on top of my skin and sliding around. Sort of difficult to rinse off too. I noticed a slight skin tightness/dried out feeling after rinsing and drying my skin which tells me it stripped away too much of my natural oils. I would describe my skin type as dehydrated but oily on the surface, so non-lathering, creamy cleansers are usually best for me, but this was so pretty I had to try it! Sad I am going to return it or give it away to a friend. The quest for my holy grail face cleanser continues..."

The smell is ultra-clean and fragrance-free of which I like (less irritating to sensitive skin types like mine). With that being said, it didn't strip my skin (like most jellies do), but it didn't hydrate it either. The bonus is that I thought it removed all of my sunscreen and tinted moisturizer and my face felt clean without being stripped. Also, it DID NOT irritate my skin at all, which is a big A+ from me. Also, an A+ for the beautiful packaging. Knocking off one-star because it does not hydrate."

I was a little deterred considering the price per oz compared to the others, but I use waaaay less of this bc it lathers up to like 1000% its size. I use two pumps (literally a pea size) and itu2019s plenty after lather. The product has a pleasant jelly feel on the face, unlike the Drunk Elephant, which feels like a dry jelly and you use way more. Pleasant, natural smells and it leaves my face feeling like itu2019s already moisturized before I even continue my routine. Def recommend, already got another friend hooked. Now, I look at the price as a steal bc the formula is amazing and the packaging is always perfect with Herbivore. Bless yu2019all <3"

I have never had a reaction to a skincare product like this before. No clue why this happened because this product clearly seems to work for other people, but be aware this could possible happen to you!"

I have combo skin, it cleanses without stripping too much. Both my oily and dry areas feel really balanced.  It also emulsifies with water really well. It only takes a small amount to cover the whole face so I know it is going to last a while.

For its price point I think it will last a long time. I think the key to the success of this product is the use of the mushroom ingredient.

Even after adding in serums and additional moisture, this cleanser has been the most effective product in combatting those spots. It's very moisturizing for a cleanser, plus it feels silky and smells lovely. I do a full minute cleanse with it and still--no dry spots! I switched from the Glossier Milky Jelly, and while this is slightly less product for a slightly higher price, the results (and the switch to cleaner ingredients) is enough to justify the (still reasonable) price point!"

I loved the way those worked for my skin and the price point is awesome too however Iu2019m just a sucker for a beautiful glass pump cleanser to keep in my shower. I was ecstatic to see this new product in Sephora in my most recent trip. I am in LOVE with this cleanser and this it is perfect for those who have combination/oily and sensitive skin. The packaging on this product is perfection, the price point for the ingredients and packaging components are impressive, and the formula itself is unique in consistency, lather, and results! I already ordered 3 more because I know this is my new holy grail cleanser."

It does remove make up although it will sting your eye a little bit if it gets in there. If Iu2019m wearing a lot of makeup Iu2019ll go in with an oil cleanser first but in these quarantine days I barely wear any so Iu2019ll just use this at night and Iu2019m good.

It washes off pretty easily and then my skin was left with a squeaky texture even while in the shower--not quite dry/tight, but not moisturized either. It will do for now, but for those into gel cleansers, I still favor Mario Badescu's enzyme cleanser (better cost, smell, feeling)."

I've been using this face cleanser for about 1 month now and I can genuinely say it is the BEST face cleanser I have ever used! I haven't experienced any breakouts since using this product, it instantly makes your skin feel soft and smooth, and I love this product especially because after every use your skin never feels dry or dried out from using it, your skin will feel moisturized.

I hadnu2019t read the details about it except that the bottle says creamy jelly cleanser. Thatu2019s exactly what it feels like and even thought how great it is to use a cleanser that doesnu2019t strip my face of everything it needs. Then I read the details and it says it wonu2019t strip the face! I havenu2019t used it with makeup on but can already tell from the texture that itu2019ll help makeup slide right off. No harsh scent either. Forgot to mention I usually wake up with a breakout on my nose or chin when itu2019s humid out but that hasnu2019t happened since I started using this cleanser nightly.

My biggest concern was that it would be too creamy and wouldn't leave my face feeling clean, but it is the PERFECT balance of moisturizing while still providing a clean slate of skin. I never thought I would spend money on a cleanser beyond my usual drugstore buys but after receiving a sample of this with another purchase from herbivore, I will definitely be purchasing the full size of this one. I have dry, sensitive, combination skin prone to congestion."

The only downside is you don't have very much control over how much product you use with the pump, but I think that's something they could fix easily.  Additionally, it has a bit of a 'soapy' smell you'd find in a hand soap, which may just be due to the rosewater."

Iu2019m super picky with face wash over all my products and I must say, this face wash is amazing. I am almost done with my sample and will be purchasing standard size ASAP. Grateful to find a new cleanser because I was really over mine. Herbivore to the rescue :)"

This is gentle, cleansing, removes impurities and cleanses skin, hydrates, leaves my skin feeling new and fresh and soft! First time using a jelly cleanser and wasnt sure about it, but it's a new fave!!! Herbivore is an amazing brand and has not failed me!! I use their Pheonix Facial Oil, Blue Tansy Resurfacing Mask, and Pink Cloud Moosturizer! 10/10 best skin I've ever had!"

Definitely going to be my go-to unless something better comes along, and thatu2019s going to be hard to do!"

I don't wear a full caked face, but I do wear tinted moisturizer, powder, and mascara regularly. I use one to two pumps and take time moving across my face in circular motions and after about a minute, everything is ready to rinse off. Leaves you feeling clean but not dried out. Really nice cleanser and one of the few I found that actually works. The glass bottle is very nice though I do think another material would be more practical... otherwise, 5 stars!"

The packaging and the product itself is very lux feeling for it's price as it is glass and the color of the product is a beautiful shimmering light pink. Granted, I have used it once since I just got it, but the instant results has been very hydrating and non-stripping. The smell is interesting, but not off-putting at all. It's just the raw and clean ingredients shining through. There is no lid, but a twist on the pump to either stop the product from coming out or allowing it to be pushed down and out.   The product itself is very creamy (not foamy) and I LOVED gently rubbing it into my skin. I feel this product will be best for people with dry and sensitive skin. I would even recommend this for my grandma with aged skin.   I love this face wash!"

It has a light refreshing scent, thatu2019s very important for me as too much fragrance irritates my skin. Itu2019s so gentle on my dry skin and leave it feeling moisturized and healthy as opposed to dry and stripped like most cleansers do. The packaging is super nice quality, itu2019s glass and feels fancy. I like that itu2019s glass because itu2019s much better for the environment. Brands of the same price range often use plastic which feels low quality and harms the environment. This bottle is heavy and feels luxurious! Overall Iu2019d highly recommend this product. :)"
