I don't really wear foundation so a lightweight skin tint is more my speed and I was intrigued.  Packaging was great but shade range is pretty limited (I wound up going with MN3 which I thought might be a bit too light for me tbh). However, I gotta say that because it blends so effortlessly into the skin, the shade worked overall pretty well for my complexion! This color corrected majority of my redness with even just a few swipes - im taking one swipe on the forehead, one on each cheek - but didn't feel heavy at all. Freckles still came through a bit, which is exactly what I was looking for.  Felt like you could easily build up more coverage if that's what you're looking for.  I used a brush on one half of my face and my fingers for the other side and both looked great so I feel like this would be a great travel buddy or I have 5 minutes to get my face in line companion.  My only slight issue was that I did get some patchiness in between my brows but I get that with nearly every product I use because I tend to get quite dry around there - but nothing major and was able to mostly fix that with a bit of extra blending and a setting spray.  Took a star off for that & the limited shade range - but will definitely be going back to this product and this brand often."

The shape of the stick is great for application purposes, and the shade match is *perfect*. I'll definitely keep using it for those reasons. However, I really don't recommend this to anyone with dry skin, and it might not work to great for some with combination skin either. The formula of this stick feels drying on the skin, especially for long wear throughout the day, and it really makes some of my dry spots on my face stand out. When I bought this, the lady who sold it to me at my Sephora recommended I use a LOT of setting spray when I apply it, I didn't understand it at first until I tried to wear it for a full day and it seriously settled onto my dry skin and into my skin texture. The next time I used it, I made sure to moisturize just before applying it, and set it with extra setting spray after - and it wore pretty well for a full day, accept for one dry spot on my nose. So I might even recommend, make sure you keep your skin well exfoliated when you're planning to use this, because it loves skin texture or dryness."

It is rather dewy which had me worried as I am an oily skin girl, but a dusting of translucent powder kept me going through my night shift just fine. I can't say enough how fantastic this stick is. It has light to medium adjustable coverage and a satin finish and does need to be powdered if you are oily. Dry skin girlies will love the finish and feel.

I was able to hydrate my skin enough to improve those dry patches and havenu2019t had any issues with the foundation separating since. This is meant to have a primer built in, which is great because I always forget my primer, yet this still wears pretty well throughout the day. I would recommend applying to the back of your hand instead of directly to your face to avoid applying too much product and it can be blended with a brush or sponge based on your preference."

I didn't even do a full skincare prep or primer before this, just slapped on some moisturizer and it looks beautiful.  When I first applied it, it did seem to cling to my dry patches but after about 5 minutes it really soaks into the skin and dries down beautifully. So give it a couple minutes before you judge. It even looks great under my nose and the corners of my mouth where I have a healing, flakey dermatitis rash! If you've never usee a foundation stick before like me it is a little odd, feels like rubbing in a concealer. I did three small swipes on my forehead, two on each cheek and one on my chin."
