Formula is thin, glides on smoothly and feels nice, but not worth the price with such awful color pay off and inaccuracy."

The glassy finish & flushed pink appearance also lasts on the lips quite well, the color does faintly stain the skin. It smells (extremely) faintly and naturally of honey and vanilla, which I liked as well. However I only give it 3 stars because there is such a small amount of balm that it was finished completely in under 2 months, not even with daily use! I find it especially unfortunate as this is not a refillable product, so the waste would be considerable if I continued to repurchase often - not to mention it's very pricy!! I would purchase again, but I do hope that a refillable version is produced, or with a larger amount of balm."

            "review_text": "The case is like an elegant little work of art (like Paloma Picasso's jewelry designs). Absolutely delighted by this balm which is perfect for those occasions where you want a little polish and glow to your natural look. It goes on beautifully, feels great even after a couple of hours and lends just a hint of color. The scent is subtle and charming: a little rose, a little spun sugar. A drop-dead gorgeous exterior for your grown-up, chic, lady self and a little sugar for your inner child. The whole package. I purchased Honey Glow to compliment fair complexion and blue eyes."

It will turn the same shade of pink no matter what, skin tone maq1y 1make it appear different on different people but it's nothing special. the fact that this isn't advertised as pH adjusting is pretty sad considering the price tag and because I made the mistake of purchasing somewhere other than sephora, I'm stuck with a very expensive balm I can't wear not able to return it. it's a nice balm but that ugly PH pink looks awful on me and I know I'm not the only one. annoying it isn't advertised as such."

Third, the color is a gorgeous delicate glow. I have very pigmented lips and other lip tint brands that I have purchased have left my lips too pigmented, which I really dislike. This on the other hand goes on very sheer in its first swipe, but is buildable. After a second / third stroke, the lips will begin to reflect more color. As I lean towards soft tones, the delicate pink is the perfect shade for me.

            "review_text": "I am sadly returning it! I wanted to like it, but it didnu2019t work for me. The smell was pleasant (roses), but the taste was lightly lingering, not good or bad; I didnu2019t want that taste. The colour was also patchy and would cling to only the inner part of my lips and would disappear somehow out the outer part of my lips. It also made my lips peel. I will stick with my Dior lip glow as my balm and rare beauty glossy balm. I love the idea of the balm, though! Also, the colour was very subtle but gave a nice healthy glow, nothing new or extraordinary."
