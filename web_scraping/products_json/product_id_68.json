Unfortunately for me this year, my skin has been the driest Ive experienced in my life! I started reaching through my entire cabinet of skincare and doing double duty - even started going through the samples when I found this. I applied it and found the consistency thin but decidedly underwhelming for my current purposes; I was looking for heavy duty, Aquaphor level stuff, tbh, which is not something Ive ever needed for my face before. I generally like thinner consistencies as I find heavy creams overwhelm my skin, but you likely understand why I found the thinness of this product, in this moment, disappointing, given the context. Surprisingly however -  my skin drank this up really well (along with 3 others moisturizers) and I found visible change in results the very next day. I wasnt sure which product made the most difference so I rotated this with the other moisturizers, and the days I used/didnt use this, there was a noticeable difference. I was able to successfully overcome the extreme dry season, but still find myself reaching for this here and there as my skin just feels really supple and calm when I use this. Thankfully it doesnt take dollops of this to feel a difference. I really dislike the price, but Im going to have to purchase a full size when my sample runs out as its been a huge part of me overcoming and maintaining healthy skin this winter."

I noticed  my skin looked clearer, supple (like after a hydrating facial), it absorbed perfectly and made my skin super soft.  I have combo skin and this did not make me greasy in my usually super oily areas.  I also got a few compliments on the texture of my skin after about a weeku2019s of use.

I generally use it during the day on clean skin when I plan on going barefaced. I use it all the way up to my lower lash line and forego eye cream. Iu2019ve seen reviews that said that it pills when you apply it over other products. I canu2019t speak to that, but every so often when Iu2019m not barefaced, I apply a tinted sunscreen or Ilia Super Serum Skin Tint and concealer over this moisturizer. These products sit beautifully on top of The Cream. Itu2019s pricey but a little goes a long way. Love it so much!"

It's very rare to find two formulations of a product, with the one aimed at oilier and younger skin types turning out to be the better of the two! Anyhow, I used this daily as instructed, followed by SPF until I'd used up the product. It absorbs quickly and has a very light scent to it which reminds me ever so slightly of a bakery with a hint of cocoa powder! Packaging is stunning too. Did I notice better skin? Yes, a slightly brighter, more even and hydrated complexion for sure. But...nothing out of the ordinary. In fact speaking of ordinary I could achieve the same results with an assortment of The Ordinary serums (which I've also tried extensively) and all for about 1/15th of the price of a full size jar of this, and they would last much longer too! This is why I cannot give 'The Cream' 4 or 5 lippies, the price point is just absurd. If I can achieve similar results for less money, why would I pay more?    ~ My Sephora Top 7 must-have list ~  (My top 7 must-have beauty products of all time, focusing mainly on my purchases at Sephora)  1.

I did not see any difference in skin tone or aging. I personally have preferred my la roche posay over this AB one. If you can comfortably afford this, try it out, but if it feels like a splurge, I'm telling you it's not worth it...you'll probably get the same or better results with a consistent skincare routine using more affordable products."

If you want to work on texture , fine lines, firmness, and hyperpigmentation then this is for you. For me personally I cannot use a super greasy moisturizer or it ruins my texture, so for me this is great. If you are looking for just an amazing basic moisturizer because you have extreme dry skin then this is prob not for you.

(I donu2019t know if it was an allergic reaction or using too many products) I was running out of my Skinceuticals triple lipid restore cream, which is supposed to help skin barrier but was doing nothing for my dry patches, so I thought why not try Augustinus Bader? The La Mer cream I have also didnu2019t help at all with the dry patches and just made my skin oilier than it already is. Well, the first day using it my impressions were that it felt nice going on. No irritation. I woke up and thought maybe the redness went down a little but I also thought my skin felt tight. Not what Iu2019ve been used to with the products I use. The second day, redness and dry patches definitely better but still felt a little tight. Fine lines around eyes seem more obvious, not moisturized. Third day, yes redness and dry patches much better. Skin still a little tight but not as bad. Fine lines not as bad as day before. Fourth day, whoa! Everything looks better and clearer. Iu2019m not as oily. Face isnu2019t tight. Fine lines improving. The dry patches better. Redness gone. Overall, just clearer. Fifth day, wow! Everything looks and feels better. Sixth day, still getting better. Seventh day, incredible! Itu2019s like thereu2019s a bit of a smoothing filter on my face. Clear and not oily. Like I have powder on. Skin just feels balanced. Each day after, itu2019s gotten a little better. All I use after cleansing my skin is this cream and spf in morning. I may try adding retinol into routine again after another week or two. My opinion if you are trying this cream, give it at least one week of use and donu2019t use any other products. I think this cream is best for oily or combo skin. If you donu2019t get oily, try the rich cream version. I hate how much it costs but if my skin continues to look as good as it does now I will find a way to keep buying it!"

Iu2019m not a believer in miracle products, I think creams can only do so much. I rarely wear daily moisturizers because I dislike having a coat of cream on my face and I honestly prefer the natural texture of my skin u2014 I have very good skin but still, creams never give the skin a nice texture. You can always see it. I use masks and treatments. Anyway, this cream (provided that you donu2019t expect miracles) is really the best Iu2019ve used (and I have tried everything from Lara Devgan to Fresh to Lancu00f4me to Glossier to Sisley to cheap pharmacy brands to French brands unfindable in the US). It is scentless (yay!), comes in a pump (great!), and it just gives you skin the most seamless u2018improvementu2019 Iu2019ve seen. After a few minutes, you canu2019t see it anymore it just melts away and your skin is smoother. But whatu2019s impressive is that the instant effect actually improves the more you use it. Iu2019m more impressed now than the first time I tried it. Iu2019m in my late 40s, so my skin shows fatigue more easily and is prone the hormonal changes u2014 letu2019s say I have good skin and bad skin days. This cream is a sort of stabilizer. And my skin is sensitive (rosacea) and my eyes prone to styes. This is a very, very good product."

Following the instructions and only using 2 drops on my face and 2 on my neck once a day, the bottle barely lasted a month.  I frankly think it is OBSCENE to charge so much for a cream that does not last a month.  If I used it twice a day as they recommend, I don't think it would have even lasted the 3 weeks you need to see a difference.

Hereu2019s the thing: if you want to use additional serums/products you can. However be sure to lay this down FIRST BEFORE anything else. I know thatu2019s sacrosanct to everything we know about layering however the TCF8 component needs to be the first thing on your skin. However with this you donu2019t actually NEED much of anything else. Less is more with this which is why I was drawn to it to begin with Bc I was getting tired of 15 steps every AM & PM. Iu2019ve eliminated all additional serums/creams!! Patience is key with this also. Around week 2/2.5 you will start to see results and between week 4-6 itu2019s just magical. Iu2019ve totally fallen in love with AB and just recently bought the entire line from the cleanser and the essence/toner (on their website) to the new serum and eye cream that was just launched.

Mom has gone through chemotherapy recently with really bad skin reaction on her face. Redness and swelling are 1st 2 symptoms within 2 days, then skin inflammation, pinching and aching. She was afraid to try any new product on her face but then again she was never the type which will use only one brand. She always likes to test new products because with age there are new developments and technology which has better effect on skin.   Anyhow, when she applied the cream it is somewhat thick and oily, and when it dries out the skin is sticky. It takes about 1 hour for application to sync in and then happens the magnificent effect of softness which firms the cheeks and removes wrinkles around moth area.   Price wise, YES Expensive, however cream presents real visual effect so on that matter itu2019s well worth the price. We will definitely order in upcoming holidays."

I prefer to wait till the very end of the review window to make sure I am giving each product the opportunity to perform as  promised.   I was also concerned about whether this cream was contributing to acne, as I had a few spots pop up during the time I've used the products. I can now definitively say it was maskne due to TX heat, not the moisturizer. I have not had any irritation with Augustinus Bader's The Cream. It's been a lovely evening moisturizer but I am now switching it to my daytime moisturizer. One of the first things that I noticed was how the texture of The Cream is just perfect. It has a slight slip to it and just feels amazing on the skin. It also absorbs well and doesn't feel tacky.   I have definitely seen a positive difference in the texture of my skin in terms of fine lines, plumpness, and acne scarring from my youth. When I put this on at night, my skin is super soft, supple, and feels calmed.   The results seem to be more pronounced now that I'm using it in conjunction with The Cream Cleansing Gel. They work well in tandem together as a skincare system (symbiotic ingredients I am gathering).   While I will buy just about anything if I see major results, the price is a bit steep to me due to the following: It does not help with my redness/rosacea. The ingredients contain Phenylalanine, which I am not a fan of. Despite these concerns, it's still a magical and powerful restorative moisturizer that I can get behind.   Thankful to Influenster for sending the voxbox my way complimentary for testing purposes."

A couple of things I noticed about the product. Firstly, itu2019s unscented, which tells me theyu2019re not adding extra ingredients and lets me feel like It may be suitable for someone with sensitive skin. Second, a little goes a long way, so for the price of The Cream, youu2019re getting a big bang for your buck. While using The Cream, I was also using Augustinus Bader The Cream Cleansing Gel. I think I got the best results from The Cream after first using the cleansing gel, which I will also review . All in all, if youu2019re looking for immediate results, this is a great product. I personally didnu2019t have a progression in which I noticed my skin feeling more evenly textured, moisturized and less fine lines.

I have combo skin and with that, quite a few areas of my face that are really dry. Since I've been using this, that's gone. My entire face is hydrated and dewy. It'sn lightweight and gentle but super effective. With that being said, the price point is the part I'm not loving. For me to give 5 stars and actually buy it for the price it actually is, well, it would have to do everything from hydrate, fight aging as well as my breakouts, and have spf in it.

Weu2019re into purchase this again, I would not use it solo as I think a skincare routine needs toners, acids, hyaluronic acid, ceramides, vitamin c, retinoids etc for sustained improvement. I have read of others using this in tandem with different products who were wowed by the results. This would however be a great choice for anyone seeking simplicity in their routine and with a good skincare budget. For those who are broke, donu2019t scrimp and save for this as itu2019s not life changing - you can buy a bunch of cheap actives that would give you similar results. For those who can afford it, itu2019s a great choice for a moisturizer and I would consider repurchasing as my skin has been looking lovely this month."

            "review_text": "What do you do when you get a Vox box with a cream with celeb-backed hyped and loved by all at all levels with few exceptions? I started fresh with this cream, took a break from my usual skin care regimen for about ten days to test it. In the meantime, I didnu2019t used any product(s) with it other than exfoliating once a week.  The Augustine Bader Rich cream focus areas are fine lines, wrinkles, redness, loss of elasticity and pores. The most important breakthrough ingredient of this cream is TFC8. I looked forward to getting those happy results too and this cream has not disappointed me in that area.  The cream is formulated as a hydrating formula backed by the science with proven results and like I said earlier endorsed by celebs. TFC8 (Trigger factor Complex) is a complex that helps our skin cells to repair and regenerate it naturally. This complex consists of amino acids, vitamins and other synthesized molecules found naturally in our skin cells.  After 11-12 days, I have seen patches of redness around my forehead and dryness around upper cheeks area minimized. And my skin felt refreshed and different aka cleaner glow when your skin cells are repaired from inside out minus any toxic and chemicals in the skin care products. My skin has pores issues and redness issues, if I use anything other than the mild cleanser and mild products. The Rich cream is a soothing change for my skin.  Pros- Creaminess  Packaging and color scheme is attractive Easy to understand directions and Ingredientu2019s list Patented TFC8 technology  Hydrating formula  Amazing list of ingredients from Argan, avocado oil to Squalene which helps with the skin elasticity.   They donate 5% of your order value to the select charities.  The product is 100% vegan and free from gluten, parabens, heavy metals and fragrances.  Cons-  Price range of $170 for 30ml can be high for few. Now a good question- Am I going to switch to this product from my usual holy grail products? I might switch to this one"

I have Dry / Combo sensitive skin with early signs of fine lines, hyper pigmentation, and dark spots. You can see before and after photos below, images were taken 4 weeks apart.   Quality / Ingredients The quality of the cream cleansing gel is great all the ingredients are top notch and clean. You also have the secret key  (ingredient) technology from Dr Bader which is the TFC8 which took years of research to develop.   Packaging Feels very high end and is gorgeous, I work in product development so I know how much time the little details on the tops, quality of the glass etc can take and I truly appreciate it. Also the boxes that the bottles come in are made fully recyclable FSC-Certified paper.   Appliation The creme goes on so smooth and is super gentle on the skin. My skin tends to react to skincare fairly quickly and it was gentle enough for my skin to adapt immediately.   Since I tend to be dry (especially on my mouth, nose and chin area I did have to add another more moisturizing cream on top, especially at night.    You can see in the images below that it did even out my skin tone, especially on my cheeks. It also helped with my dark circle pigmentation. I did also want to point out that it did not break me out and did not add any other blemishes besides my annoyingly persistent 2 hormonal pimples on my right chin area.   Overall I loved being able to see results with the before and after and as much as I want to justify the high price tag of the creme I just canu2019t. Yes, my skin loved it but I canu2019t imagine spending 170-265$ every 2-3 months. I do think there are other products out there that probably can give you similar results and that is why Iu2019m giving it 4 out of 5 stars just because of the price tag. I would hope that Dr Bader would come out with a sub-brand with a more affordable price tag for those of us that canu2019t always afford high ticket items."

It is not scented or dyed, which is nice and my preference. A little goes a long way and the smaller bottle will last awhile. The bottle it self is very simple and nice looking.   Unfortunately it felt very strange on my skin, almost oily and tacky. It did not feel like it sunk in. I tried to use it 3 separate times and each time I got extreme breakouts, including some that turned into wounds. I generally have fairly clear skin, and it began to clear up when I stopped using this each time. It did not seem to mix well with my other products. I had to stop using it altogether the third attempt. Perhaps it just disagrees with me. I have sensitive, combination skin, with a tendency towards redness.  This may work very well for some others, but honestly at this price point there are other choices that are less expensive and reduce fine lines. The bottle although nice is a per peeve of mine for expensive products, it is wasteful and will be difficult to use all the product."

I stopped using all of my skincare for the last three weeks and Iu2019ve only been using this and the Augustinus Bader cleanser. My pores, which had enlarged with age, are almost invisible now in some places and are much smaller and still shrinking in others.

My skin is oily so I didnu2019t feel a need to layer a moisturizer on top of this after the first few days, but YMMV.

I was really hoping for pore refinement and I was very disappointed that it did nothing for me in this department. The whiteheads are a dealbreaker for me, unfortunately.

I haven't really seen any huge changes in my skin, or even minor changes that I can attribute to just this cream.  Still I do think its a lovely product, no irritation and it blends in easily. Layers under my other skincare so well with no issues but again it's not better than other moisturizers I've tried.  I do think its great for oily skin as its not too heavy, and doesn't leave my skin feeling oily."

I finally found one that doesnu2019t pill with any of my products! On top of that, I find my skin looking extra radiant and feeling smoother when I use this product. Itu2019s also really helped keep my skin very clear - one night I switched back to my old night time moisturizer and I found bumps on my chin starting to form. I went back to this cream and they went away.

After discovering the ingredient in other beauty products of mine, I decided to go for it. I havenu2019t honestly noticed much of a difference yet, but feel that once I use the product for a little longer, that maybe Iu2019ll notice a more marked difference in my tone, pore size, etc. I have a little trouble justifying the price tag to know if I would for sure buy it again, but depending on the long-term results that opinion may change. For anyone apprehensive about this, I implore you to buy one of the cheaper, smaller ones and then see if it is for you. So far though I am really enjoying this brand and the cleanser that accompanies this moisturizer as well!"

While the price point outpaces some of my favorite brands (Tatcha, Dr. Perricone, etc) the price is well below other luxury brands such as La Mer, while retaining many of the same qualities. As an RN who works in the hospital in a facemask for over 12 hours a day, skincare is everything to me right now. I received Augustinus Baderu2019s The Cream and The Gel Cleanser and used them religiously for a month in order to truly assess the impact of these products on my skin. I incorporated the cleanser for the first week and then added The Cream. I would say that the combination of these products has transformed my skin in a way that I have not seen with any other skincare items.   My previous regimen was exclusively Tatchau2019s Dewy line, but I consider Augustinus Bader products to be now an integral part of that ritual. The Gel Cleanser reminds me of Cetaphil (if you know, you know), and I will leave details about that product on its product page, but The Cream is the u201cgame changeru201d in my view. Three to four pumps easily covers my face, jaw, and neck. After a month the results that I have seen are similar to that of a (subtle) dermal filler (think Sculptra, not Botox). The Cream has made noticeable impacts to the structural integrity of my skin, removing the fine lines and crows feet from around my eyes, smoothing the marionette lines that have been worsening wearing such a tight mask for so long, and giving my skin a plump and smooth appearance that looks like the u201cglass skinu201d I have always wanted. I thought it was impossible, but I have the better skin now than I did when I was in my early twenties. My skin looks plump, poreless, and lit from within. It is amazing to me to have found a product that meets all my skincare needs in one, but somehow Augustinus Bader has done just that. It is worth every penny..... in fact next time Iu2019ll buy my own."

I experienced some drying at night when i used it and had to use a heavy cream after or a overnight mask. However I do believe the product calmed, healed, and nourished my skin. In the morning I used it before makeup prep it was great. I see a difference, my fine lines are softer on forehead, smile lines and eyes. This is a light cream almost like a lotion. I am very impressed with the anti-aging properties and the visible difference."

I began to research the brand found that itu2019s backed by science and that they recommended a 27 challenge where you only use their products. They offer more products than the ones I am using but I am so happy with these and prefer it to the multi-step routine I had before. The cream is so light, absorbs quickly, and has no strong scent. I recommend and will continue buying this product."

The faint u2018scentu2019 reminded me of self tanning products. But it was such a light scent, no biggie.

This reduced the size of my pores and plumped my fine lines within two weeks. VERY happy.   Knocking off one star because of the price.

I like the dewyness and softness itu2019s giving my face. I dont consider my self having problematic skin but this makes my skin looks EXTRA! darn i dont want to like this but I do, and it isnt pricey if you think about using just one product vs.. serum, essense, moisturizer..and etc. I am a busy mom, i work fulltime and run small business ar home, this gives me extra time to relax since i havent been doing my 7 steps skincare. Any extra time I get, i will take.So all in all, not only it will save you money, will also save you time.

I had been using some pretty harsh acne treatments and cleansers prior that were not only ineffective for my acne concerns but had caused severe dryness, irritation, and rough patches so everything about this product sounded amazing. The results after only three weeks have sold me on this product and the cleanser. I've seen a significant reduction in pore size, redness, and breakouts. The hydration level of my skin has been restored and the texture of my skin is remarkable. The lines around my eyes when I smile have reduced and the overall plumpness that I've gained is major. I can't say enough good things about the two products. I wish I had taken a before photo.  I'm anxious to see how the products will help with the scarring. My skin is healthy and feels amazing."

The Cream does not really have a scent, and I found 1 pump was enough for my face and neck.  The Cream was readily absorbed and did not leave a tacky film.  I used The Cream alone and with my other skincare products.  My results were, it did not cause me to break out (a real problem for me), moisturized my skin, and nothing else.  I cannot tell even the slightest improvement or change in skin.  It for me is simply an adequate moisturizer, but at this price, I expect more than just another cream."

Iu2019ve been using this product for a few weeks now, along with their cream cleansing gel, and my skin is not reacting well at all. I tend to have very dry, sensitive and reactive skin. I wouldnu2019t call it a cream, this product goes on very lightweight and does not give me nearly enough hydration. Even when I tried using it as a serum in my routine, my skin still felt overly sensitive. One of the key ingredients is Vitamin A (retinyl palmitate) which I donu2019t have much of a tolerance for so that could by part of the problem. Overall I was very disappointed, I really wanted to love this!"

Iu2019ve used many luxury skincare brand moisturizers over the years: Sisley, La Mer, etc. What I love most about The Cream by Augustinus Bader is the fact that itu2019s a serum, eye cream and lotion all in one. Sure, at $180 USD/ oz, the price tag is steep but you only have to buy one product rather than separate serum, eye cream and moisturizer, so in actuality you are likely saving money. I am age 49, combination skin, living in an urban, sunny hot/humid climate (aka my skin can get stressed and reactive). Due to some health issues recently, my skin is also quite dehydrated and prone to rashes. I was a little nervous to try a new product but so glad I did! In just 14 days of use, there was a noticeable improvement in the overall quality of my facial/neck/decolletage skin. The lotion has no detectable fragrance and is very lightweight and effective. Iu2019ve noticed my sun spots are fading, pores appear smaller and overall my skin is less congested, less reactive and there is a notable reduction in redness. It is truly my new holy grail moisturizer. I did receive this product free of charge from Influenster in exchange for my honest review, but will definitely purchase again and again because it is such an effective product."

I did some research and honestly wasn't overly impressed with the ingredients and their placement on the list. Now you are looking at my stars and scratching your head. Don't worry me too! I have oily combo skin and I love skin care. Because I'm reviewing I stopped using my normal skin care to see how my skin changed over the month I have had it and that was the big surprise! The moisturizer is light in consistency and thin. Reminds me of the drunk elephant protini and has a similar scent that is quick to dissipate. The packaging looks heavy but is light in hand. However, it is very beautiful and looks lux. Okay cons, the product takes a while to sink in. It doesn't sit on the skin but it also feels for a while that it isn't doing anything. After using the face wash from this line but akin can feel right and this doesn't instantly relieve it. I would be thoughtful about what kind of face wash you use. If it strips your face or extra dry while I believe it will work it's going to take a second. Honestly after my first wash and using this I had no plans of returning. Pros: This is great under makeup, and on my oily face it seems to help me not be overly oily. Also the biggest surprise my skin looks great. So great that I haven't felt like putting on concealer or light make up during the work day. Yeah that's how nice it is my face is brighter and while I have my trouble areas they seem to be better. I would think with more use and finally putting other products back into the routine it is going to be a keeper especially in these warm months. If you are looking to invest and the cons don't bother you too much this is a winner. Added a photo of me after 8 hours of wear and only mascara, eyeliner, and a little eyeshadow on. Also no filter!"

This is very moisturising and keeps my skin feeling dewy all day. I can feel the residue on my face but it's not tacky at all. But for people with oily skin I can see how it would be too much. I love the pump it makes dispensing the product easy, and of course the glass bottle is very luxurious. I just wish I could see how much product I have left. And of course although it's a great moisturiser it's not a miracle worker, but it may  worth the price. Recommended as pampering treat"

That wasn't the case with this cream. I think I've been having to use less makeup because my skin tone looks more even. They say this is powered by something called TFC8.

It doesnu2019t really have a scent, so if  you have a scent issue,  youu2019re good with this one. I love the beautiful packaging.  I canu2019t wait to see the full results after 30 days, but I will definitely be purchasing another bottle when this runs out."

It doesn't lead to me overproducing sebum while still keeping dry patches at bay. It seems like the skin improving benefits are starting to show, but I really cannot be sure yet (will update if anything exciting happens either way, good or bad).  What I'll say it's, while I really do enjoy The Cream, I, personally, can't totally justify the price. It's just a bit much for me given the ingredients... I have significantly cheaper moisturizers with similar ingredients that work, so I'm on the fence. If you have combo, oily or dehydrated skin, you might really love this! If you have the money and see looking for luxury to spoil yourself (the packaging is for sure high end!), it's worth a shot, in my opinion!!! If I won the lottery, I'd for sure make this my everyday morning moisturizer!"

My face has cleared up quite a bit while using this product! It's not flakey anywhere anymore, and it feels soft, smooth and hydrated, finally! I don't really have fine lines and/or wrinkles, so I can't speak to how or if this cream helps minimize the appearance of those, but I can imagine if it helped my face by reducing the red, inflamed areas, it would probably be effective at reducing the appearance of fine lines/wrinkles.

That flower hasn't been scientifically proven to do anything for your skin, even if it keeps it's beauty in sub-zero weather or whatever. This cream has a super elegant formula, chock full of great skincare, not brimming with fragrance or dewiness. Just a great formula of actives and peptides that can make you reconsider buying expensive serum to layer under it. AND a pump bottle to protect the integrity of the formula!

After absorbed, it does work well in firming the skin. It also smoothed my skin as advertised. But instead of my skin feeling soothed, it brought back redness that I worked hard to treat with other products. I wanted so much to love this product but it might just be that my T-zone, adult acne prone skin just doesnu2019t work with this cream. However, if you have normal to dry skin and are looking for a product that will firm and smooth your skin, this is spot on!"

I've incorporated this cream only into my evening skincare routine, and it has performed well with all of my other products (including chemical exfoliants and tretinoin). I wake up with a noticeably glower and more awakened complexion, no irritations, and no sensitivities.   The cream is more of a lotion consistency and applies easily. It absorbs quickly into the skin without feeling too thick for my combination skin, yet appears to provide the optimal level of hydration to appease my face! There is no scent to irritate the nose or the skin, and a small amount goes a long way - I find 2 pumps is enough for the entire face. I don't know what magic is in this cream, but the results speak for themselves."

This cream is a perfect lightweight, daily moisturizer, and I've been also using under makeup and it's perfect! I like having a lighter cream for the summer months and this is my new favorite. Also keeps my skin hydrated a day which is a major plus for my dry skin. I'm in my 30's now and have been searching for the best products and this will be definitely added to my skincare once I run out. Pricier products but we'll worth the price because they actually work and seen results almost immediately. Highly recommend especially paired with The Cream Cleansing Gel."
