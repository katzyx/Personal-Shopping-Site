I have seen such a difference in my skin, my skin is looking the best it has ever have. I only use Dr.Dennis gross products now. before hand, I was using ol heneriken, laniege, fenty and none of them worked. this stuff has helped clear my acne, made my face brighter, dark spots disappear and I will continue to buy regardless of price. please get this product. your skin will purge when you first start using it but it's because the chemical peels are helping the congestion rise to the surface of your skin to clear your pores out. I love this stuff and can't live with out it now."

Initial comments are this: I have had dozens of peel treatments and know what all the acids should feel like on the skin. TCA, glycolic, Jesners, Vpeel, AHA etc. This is a true medium level peel as indicated. Great product with ease of use in the packets. PRO TIP: defat your skin after cleansing. I used acetone. Sounds crazy but that's what medi-estheticians use. If there is any oil or residue on your skin it will neutralize the acid this making it less efficient. Acetone removes all oil and evaporates so quickly so it will not dry your skin out entirely. For reference I am 52 yr and Fitzpatrick 3. Using this in between Picosure laser treatment."

I use them at night on days when I don't use retinol to avoid irritation. They give my skin a glowy healthier appearance, remove dry skin and improve texture, and clear out my pores so they're less visible. Make up also looks way better on my skin when i'm using these consistently for the smooth surface they provide."

I started with a 5 box of Gentle for sensitive skin every other day. Very mild, easy to use, zero reactions but also zero results except slight softness. Tried the Universal peel pads. Followed the same protocol for 10 days using it every other day with another 5 package box. I definitely saw better results with dry skin spots and softer skin, but the congestion in my T-zone was completely unchanged. Spoke to a Sephora advisor. Read more reviews. Purchased the 5 package of Extra Strength peel pads. Now, so far Iu2019ve spent $100 to find out whether this product is the holy grail everyone else has experienced it to be, but no really good results. These peel pads definitely left a strong tingle and seemed to be finally really exfoliating my face and necku2014I was excited! So, after using 3x over the course of the week I went ahead and bought the 30 + 5 box to take advantage of the Sephora sale. Iu2019m the meantime, I received another box of 3 in a Sephora Fav collection, so I kept up my routine except instead of using every other day, I spaced them out 3-4 days because I started feeling some irritation using them more frequently. Thatu2019s when everything went badlyu2014fast! By the time I had used all 8 of the Extra Strength ones over 3.5 weeks, my face had a severe reaction. I had experienced some redness in certain spots a couple of times before but I thought maybe it was my skin care creating the reaction, so rather than use them in the mornings, I switched to evenings and only used a small amount of Dr. Strum moisturizer afterwards but no other products. I also tried to use a different technique the last few uses: instead of gently swiping across my face, I gently padded the peel pads onto my skin lightly and completely avoided delicate areas where I experienced redness. No bueno. My face was burnt my skin. Returned. Never had a reaction ever bef"

I have had hormonal acne for the past 6 years of my life and even after a round of accutane I still had a bit of acne left. This completely cleared the rest of my acne. I use the extra strength ones because my skin is used to retinol after years on it but if you've never had anything as the sort (acids or retinol) start with the mild ones and give it a try for a FULL month since it gets a bit worse than getting a lot better. This product is miraculous in my opinion but obviously what works for my skin might not work for someone else which is why I recommend starting with the mild ones for anyone who wants to give these a first try. This product gave me so much confidence and I wish I was sponsored because I spend so much money on these."

Itu2019s good for daily use but for when I need to maintain a decently healthy looking skin, I use this every 3 days or less. This product did cause a slight tingling sensation the first few times Iu2019ve used it but has not happened since then. I have a dry to normal skin with some discoloration/hyperpigmentation and clogged nose pores and the occasional breakouts. This has for sure made my skin more glowy, fresh, renewed, and less uneven and more clear skinned with rare breakouts. I usually buy this during the sales and it is so worth it in my opinion!

When I asked the brand about the percentage of AHAs in their product, they refuse to disclose the percentage. This is such a red flag to me. How are you suppose to gauge what you skin can or cannot tolerate. What if is this leads someone to try another product that has a high percent of AHAs because they were able to tolerate a product called u201cextra strengthu201d and then their barrier gets recked? To me this is dishonest a a poor practice. Iu2019m just going to assume that their non disclosure means the product uses a lower percent. Go support brands that are price and ingredient transparent!"

I purchased the 35 day pack of these and in just over a month, my scarring and breakouts have decreased to almost nothing. These peel pads changed my life and I cannot recommend them enough. As some other reviews say, I did purge a bit the first week of use but for me, the purging was worth it for these results. My skin is pretty resilient so I was able to use these daily, but now that I have this progress Iu2019ll likely be reducing to a couple times a week to maintain my results. If you have sensitive skin, Iu2019d take it slow if you decide to try these or try some of the lower strength pads before you jump to these as they can feel strong after consistent use. Overall, I cannot recommend these enough!"

It was a little too strong for my skin's situation and I think in the grand scheme, it made my acne more sensitive and deep.   Although this was a negative experience for me, I admit that the product never claimed to be more acne (especially not as severe as cystic acne), so I don't hold the against the product. I will say that you should be very careful with making sure this product is right for your skin. Do not use it on broken skin (EVER!) and make sure you adjust how often you use it based on your skin. If you are careful and use it as directed, it is absolutely phenomenal. I had no active cysts on my forehead at the time and the peel made it so smooth and glowing, so I'd definitely recommend!"

I have less oil production, less breakouts, clearer skin, softer texture, and mild reduction in deep set forehead wrinkles. I had not had any negative effects which all in all is good. I have used other peel products with similar or better results and less $$. I do love that is is a pad so it makes for easy travel when you want to up your skin care level on the go.

They have diminished over the years, but I donu2019t think they will ever truly go away. These peel pads, which are gentle and wonderful, have SHRUNK my scars to an almost invisible state. I received a bunch of these for free. I use them twice a week, right after my afternoon shower. Immediately my skin appears firmer, shinier, tighter. That night, before bed, I apply my moisturizer and serum. (Estee lauder if it matter) The next morning, I wake up and my scars are SHRUNK, my pores are invisible, and my skin is RADIANT. I am terrified to run out of this miracle product. I will start cutting the pads in half to get more uses. I have a feeling if I stop, my results will too.

I have very fair skin, and any redness or blemish is just glaringly obvious, and I get inflamed so easily. it also improved my acne scars, not a SUPER difference, but my face doesn't look like someone use a fork to put a fire out on my face....  These DO clear blemishes and improve texture. WEAR SUN SCREEN!!!!"

(Use on the same day) for 30 days. with Dr Dennis Gross serum and cream. Once you like the look of your skin, maintain it by using the peel pads 2 or 3 times a week.  If you canu2019t afford both and wanted to choose 1, I would choose the Alpha Beta Extra Strength Daily Peel Pads. I used the first 60 pads on its own and it made a huge difference with dark spots, uneven texture, and blemishes.  Advanced Retinol + Ferulic Overnight Texture Renewal Peel is very good for wrinkles. They are both good if youu2019re 44 years old like me ud83dude0a IF YOU HAVE DELICATE SKING u2013 PLEASE DO NOT FOLLOW THIS."

There were times where my skin would sting quite a bit so I would have to skip it the next day. Iu2019m content with the results and Iu2019m aware that no skincare routine vanishes hyperpigmentation over night. However, because this product claims to give clinical results, I expected the dark spots to diminish faster. But I am happy that the dark spots faded and that my skin tone was more even and glowy. My mom also said that her skin was glowy when she was using this product and dull when she stopped! Overall, I recommend these peel pads. Just be consistent and patient!"

I have been on Accutane twice and when my skin started to break out again I did not want to have to go on the third time. I decided to do a ton of research and came across Dr Whitney Bowe's skin cycling routine. I already had a perscription for tretinoin but when I first started using it I used way too much and it made my skin very sensitive. I also needed a product for exfoliation night. I wanted to try Paula's choice exfoliant but it is not available through Sephora Canada so I decided to give this a try. I am so glad I did. This is my favorite product in my routine. I notice such a difference every time I use it. It exfoliates without dehydrating my skin which is a miracle considering I live in northern BC with very harsh winters. It somehow removes all the dead skin while leaving my skin literally glowing. It works so well with my tretinoin and moisturzier - I have never had my skin look so good. Because I only use it once or twice a week with the skin cycling routine it actually is not that expensive. This box should last me 6-7 months. I didn't think I would like the individually packaged wipes but I actually love them. So good for traveling to. I have NOTHING bad to say about this product! Ive included images that are only 3 weeks apart."

You get 10 packs but I ordered three different times and I was like hey, it's 10 packs for free, might as well try it. I didn't use this for a very long time until recently.   I started noticing recently a really long and deep wrinkle across my forehead (Frankenstein sutures across the forehead) look and was panicking as it got deeper and deeper. I remembered I had several packs of these in my closet and started using it. At first I didn't see results about the wrinkle on my forehead but noticing the rest of my skin was getting clearer. I have acne prone, super duper oily skin. I also work in the medical industry so wearing masks all day for 10 hours every day, my acne was getting worse and worse. These pads seriously helped get rid of my acne and acne scars I had developed in the last two years because of Covid. I only use this two times a week because it's pretty powerful even with my super duper oily, acne prone skin.   Fast forward to two months or more, my Frankenstein wrinkle is gone! I no longer have that deep wrinkle and my face is all cleared up besides the usual time of the month acne. Since I only use this two times a week, it lasted me up to two months or more. I am forever buying these peel pads from Dr. Dennis Gross. I had ran out and started panicking needing to buy these. So I went to Dr. Dennis Gross' website, they were having 30% off on their website. Now I'm stocked until October. I am never going without these now that I have seen results! As they say, give skincare time and the results will either be there or not and this has definitely changed my skin and the results are fantastic! I regret that I didn't take a before and after photo considering I didn't think anything of this to get rid of my wrinkle but now I am never without these!"

Combining this with vitamin c in the am has completely changed my skin. I do however make sure to use thd vitamin c with this so my skin doesnu2019t get irritated.   If youu2019re on the fence regardless of the positive reviews ,I understand. What works for some, doesnu2019t for others. Thankfully they sell a trial size and if doesnu2019t work for you or you react negatively, you can just return it. I do recommend you do a patch test first, though."

After much research I decided to give this another go except this time around I donu2019t have any active acne just the after math of it! Looking through all the pictures of the before and after on the reviews here gives me hope that one day I too will have clear skin once again. So I started my first box yesterday my first treatment went well I love the smell and the tingling feeling affect it had on my face after that I applied some vitamin c gel cream which I heard is the best time to apply for better absorption! So naturally this morning I woke up my face feeling amazing and looking fresh and plum! Pretty excited to keep going although I do worry if I do keep up my routine as I do have to work long hours and come home tired but now Iu2019ve made it my mission to complete the whole box and prove the surgeons wrong that I donu2019t need a chemical peel so wish me luck and fingers crossed"

I had an esthetician tell me my skin looked like I had gotten a peel and facial at a professional salon 3 days after I started using these again. I cut them in half and use half of each step at a time to prolong their usage and find it still works great! You have to pair with a sunscreen or itu2019s like you just did all that work, go into the sun, and took a thousand steps backwards. I also have pretty sensitive skin, I was using tretoin cream and before prescribing my dr asked if I was okay with peels. I responded yes and tried it out. It wrecked my face in a matter of days. The way that these are so strong and effective while not giving me any type of irritation is WILD. One of the best products out there for skin.

I usually have some hormonal acne and Iu2019m terrible for picking at it and leaving scars. This product not only prevented the acne but cleared up all the scars so quickly. When I went to repurchase I was told this is a product you should use for 1 month straight just 2 times a year. Itu2019s like a facial that resurfaces your skin. Itu2019s expensive but if thatu2019s the price I have to pay for clear glowing skin then itu2019s soooo worth it. Will be buying again in a few months for another round."

I had to wait a day and then used this product only at night. I did nights only to avoid the sun with this product on since it does make the skin more vulnerable(retinols, BHA, & AHA should be night products only). I made sure also to put on my sunscreen every morning also (I make my own sunscreen with zinc oxide/ an oil, zinc might have helped). My skin did get really dry at first so I had to take a 4-5 day break, but after that I used it consistently. My skin still has light spots and a few baby pimples. Yet, itu2019s still better then before. Something is better then nothing too me. Takes patience, but definitely worth it. I was honestly amazed just after using the 5 pack I had immediate results.

There is no question, that this is a pricy product and a lot of the products in skin care are luxury rather than necessity. But I believe this is worth every penny and I was buying this even when I could just barely afford. I am not suggesting everyone does the same but I want to stress how much of a difference this actually makes. You can often get this as sample and you will see a difference from one treatment. I started with the regular and moved on to the extra strength as my skin built tolerance. I have never used this daily as suggested as my skin is sensitive and I donu2019t feel the need, but this does everything that you would expect 5 other masks to do. Definitely try the trial size before committing to the full size. When I first tried this product I had a pretty intense reaction, it does sting a bit and if you are sensitive it can make you red. You should be cognitive of your skin type and what you are comfortable using but this is really amazing."

Iu2019ve spent my lifetime and a small fortune trying to figure out the maze that is my skin.   After almost a year using Dr Gross, I can truly say that it lives up to the hype. For the first time in my LIFE my skin is flawless, old scars are barely visible, my pores are smaller, and I rarely get acne. My skin has improved so much, that I find that I only need to use the peel about twice a week (when Iu2019m PMSing Iu2019ll use it once a day). Iu2019ve never been the kind of girl who feels comfortable leaving the house without foundation, but this product has honestly changed all that.

These ones in the morning and the other one at night. I will also say that while these state u201cExtra Strenghtu201d, I found them very mild, barely tingling at all (which is great for a daily peel). I am used to stronger chemical peels like the Olga Lorencin Red Carpet box (but I definitely could not do that one daily).  On to the review now. I gave it only 3 stars because of what Iu2019ve read here before buying. I had high expectations, especially for some acne scarring I have and frequency of breakouts, which are things that are mentioned in reviews. I am 38 years old and while I am blessed with barely having any wrinkles, I still have annoying breakouts. I wash my face twice a day with a 10 step K-Beauty routine, so itu2019s not that my skin care isnu2019t on point - it definitely is.   I was expecting this to fade those darker spots from acne scars - it did not.  I was expecting this to help with breakouts - it did not, I broke out as much as before starting using it, with my periods. So in all fairness, I know my breakouts are hormonal but I still had hopes.  What it did do, however, is my pores are clearly tightened on my T-zone and cheeks. And the overall texture has also improved, except for those acne scars.   Would I buy it again? A strong maybe. I might try his professional grade peel instead and see where that gets me with my goals since itu2019s around the same price point. The smell is pleasant and being used to stronger peels, I can definitely say this can be used daily but I donu2019t think it completely delivered on my expectations based on reading reviews here.   Also, my box of 30+5 was actually 30+4. So Iu2019d recommend counting them right at the cash register in store. That was a bit disappointing.   Iu2019d recommend these if fading darker spots ARE NOT in your concerns. If your priority is tighter pores and softer skin, go for them!"

I have been trying to use AHAs for a year. Iu2019ve tried upwards of 20 AHA products and even the most sensitive and low concentration acids are too much for my skin. With these pads I see results the next day that last me for days. I now have less breakouts (my monthly hormonal breakouts are no more), clearer more refined skin, and my PIE from old scars around my chin is fading quicker than Iu2019ve ever seen. Also a plus for me- itu2019s a quick peel treatment that takes maybe 4 minutes total and then I can do the rest of my routine as normal without worrying about additional layering. I have a fairly complicated routine as is so this is preferable to me over another serum. Okay now, itu2019s so good itu2019s so wonderful but what are the cons? First off there is no transparency with this product. They donu2019t disclose their percentage of actives- and normally for me thatu2019s a must, however, since I have yet to find something comparable to this product Iu2019m putting up with it begrudgingly. And do I even have to say the most obvious con of all- the price. These are crazy crazy expensive. If you truly used these everyday as they recommend you would be paying $88 monthly for one single step in your routine. Itu2019s absurd- and honestly a little rude. However, I justify this because for me I donu2019t need to use these everyday. Every other day is more than enough and I even stretch it out longer sometimes. There are holiday sets where you can get a lot for u201cfree,u201d add that to the Sephora savings event for an additional 10-20% off and you are really getting somewhere. You can potentially get 95 pads for $123 ($1.30/pad) versus $88 for 35 pads (2.50/pad). At $1.30 a pad using it every other day, that takes me down to less than $20 a month- and with that price I can handle the necessities, you know like making sure my family eats."

When that happens, buh-bye full regular skin routine.  After the last 3 week stint, I tried these again to get back on track. They are a wonder. No, you canu2019t really do them AM and PM as recommended, or even daily long term. My skin is some pretty tough but well tended hide, and even so, it hurts if you try that! Daily was fine for almost the first week, then every other day. But these will work exactly as advertised. Your skin will be wonderfully polished smooth without over-drying. For me, at least, it was also excellent for helping gunk come up in my pores from the sunscreen, bug juice, dust, etc. of weeks of outdoor shows.  Sometimes you have to try a great product under non-routine circumstances to really appreciate it. This one was totally that product.

I love it so much, I get my mother to bring it when she comes to the Netherlands, or ship it to me (since COVID). I used to use the regular strength peel until they came out with this new formula, which I was so excited to tryu2014> with my most recent purchase. I LOVE THIS PRODUCT. I used it to maintain professional microdermabrasion results from over 10 years ago as a result of acne scars on my cheeks from when I was a teenager. Now I am using it to battle fine lines and maintain even skin tone and youthful appearance. When I first got the products, I used the peel everyday for a week for a more aggressive u201cinitialu201d exfoliation, and then reduced gradually to three/two times a week and now biweekly or weekly. I am 36 years old, Caucasian with some sun damage and fine lines around the eye area. I have used this peel at night and also in the daytime, however due to my age and skin, If I am planning on applying or wearing makeup that day, that the product does not mesh well with my other creams and foundations, and emphasizes my eye lines. Now, I apply it in mornings on makeup free days (with sunscreen only) but mostly at nighttime. My skin has improved a lot. Because I get such a large quantity, I usually add 3 or 5 treatments in gifts for friends/family because it is such a high quality product that is useful for all ages and skin types ( I used it in my 20u2019 and now my 30u2019s). My sister just recently found some of the samples I had given her literally ages ago (1-2 years), tried it and sent me a text saying how amazing they are and then proceeded to video chat me to show me how nice her skin looked. After reading reviews when deciding whether or not to try to new formula, I saw that some purchasers had experienced breakouts. I did experience one larger cystic pimple on my chin after using these daily for a week, so It may be worth to consider that less frequent use is sometimes more."

I wouldnu2019t say itu2019s a huge improvement but I purchased the 30 day treatment so Iu2019m hopeful by the end of the month Iu2019ll notice more changes. Also be mindful that I am using other products along with this, which could be adding to the progress Iu2019ve seen compared to when I first started. The first week, the product did went on nicely on my face. This past week I noticed a slight burn for a few seconds. The exfoliant has a strong smell of alcohol and chemicals when applying but it doesnu2019t linger on the skin. Iu2019ll have to wait until I finish the box before I can consider if Iu2019d repurchase. So far though, so good. Below are the face products I use in my AM/PM routine:  AM (in order) 1. Dr. Dennis Gross Extra Strength Daily Peel 2. Tatcha The Essence 3. Dr. Dennis Gross Alpha Beta Serum 4. Dr. Jart Cicapair  For PM I replace step 4 with: 4. Tatcha The Dewy Skin Cream"

The tiny milia cleared up, hyperpigment has lighten and the over all texture of the skin is smooth. Highly recommend these. Light therapy shows quicker results. I have purchased these as well, but these results are from the 7 day Dr. Gross challenge."

So I was a little skeptical about how effective these peels would really be. But wow. Daily use for a month and my skin looks incredible. I have thick textured skin with large pores and acne marks. These peels have made my skin look smooth, refined and glassy. And I love that this is an easy sustainable daily routine to incorporate, rather than an expensive one time in-clinic peel that is nice for a month and then youu2019re back where you started. This is a great thing to keep my skin looking consistently awesome at home for the long term. Iu2019m hooked."

My skin is instantly smoother to the touch and looks refreshed in the morning. I can't say that I've noticed a long-term impact on my hyperpigmentation but I honestly don't care at this point. After finishing two boxes, I tried a certain red-hued dropper-style at-home peel with a similar cult following that promised similar results. That product was significantly more uncomfortable to use and did not work nearly as well. While I wish these were more affordable and required less packaging, I will be repurchasing for the foreseeable future."

I have even been told by dermatologists that there really isn't much to help me. After reading up on Dr. Dennis Gross daily peels and reading all the reviews, I decided to take the plunge. And I have zero regrets. I only wish I would have tried this product a lot sooner. My PIE has been such a pain to treat and clear up over the years and I had lost all hope. I truly cannot say enough great things about this peel. I purchased the extra strength and was worried it would irritate my sensitive skin, but it has not, at all. After the first use, I noticed a major difference. My skin is clearer, red spots are fading dramatically to the point I feel comfortable leaving the house without makeup. And when I occasionally get hormonal breakouts, this peel zaps them away. I have also noticed the fine smile lines and forehead frown lines that popped up when I reached my 30s, are gone, like, disappeared, gone. I could go on and on about how much I love this product and how it has made such a drastic difference for me. From someone who gave up hope on ever finding a product that worked, give this a try. It's so worth it and a lot less expensive than spending money trying different products that don't work."

In just under a month everything in his entire beard area had completely cleared. No ingrown hairs, no discolorations, just his perfect smooth, clear skin again.  PS. initially, for the areas that had actively infected bumps, I had him use Neosporin cream (not ointment) in the morning and then this peel at night. Once the infected areas cleared, he only needed this that he uses at night. He doesn't get new ingrown hairs since using this."

My acne controlled my life, I didnu2019t want to leave the house and my self esteem was ruined. I still break out a bit around that time of the month but itu2019s much more manageable. I purged for the first 2-3 weeks but right after it started clearing up. The purge wasnu2019t fun but I was willing to try anything. I use a good moisturizer and oil because they can be strong. Now I use them every couple of days instead of everyday to help with the leftover pigmentation. I had to be patient. Donu2019t give up if you have acne and give these a try!"

The next thing I noticed was that my skin just looked better, more radiant. My skin looks even and way less red, which in turn makes my acne less noticeable. Speaking of acne, there was a minor purging after about the first week, but after that cleared up my skin looks amazing. My mom commented that my skin looks great. Though this product is more for people with oily skin, I would suggest my dry skin peeps try this out."

I took 1 star off because the company telling people to use it everyday isint the best recommendation.  In a week my skin tone has brightened significantly and some dark spots have lightened up. If you see below my eyes, the pores are less visible and dark spots has cleared. Near my mouth, you can see that the fine lines diminished as well.  However, because of the harsh and frequent exfoliation, I got red small painful irritation bumps between my eye brows and one on my eye lid (I did not put this on my eye lid, when my face is irritated my eyelids suffer anyway) A few tips: #1 load up on barrier repair products when using this. These peel pads can cause damage your barrier even with the most resilient skin. I am using Edible Beauty Probiotic Serum (this helps with the red irritation bumps I am getting from the peel pads) and Krave Beauty Barrier Repair (not in Sephora). #2 Take picture of your skin everyday so you can see your progress. Looking at my skin now i didnu2019t  think I see much of a difference but compared to the before and after photos, I see a big difference.  Overall, if the red irritation bumps get too out of control, I will use this only 2-3 times a week. But for now, I will continue to use so I can get rid of my stubborn dark spots."

I was instantly hooked. I could not believe the glow it instantly revealed in one use. I've been meaning to buy a box of these since then. Klarna payments makes it so much easier to be able to afford skincare products like this, so kudos to Sephora for offering that option.    This product immediately increases smoothness, glow, and promotes even skin tone. That's what I can see after ONE application! I don't really have fine lines thanks to being a 37 year old that woke up and started taking care better care of her skin at age 30 (daily spf, periodic microneedling treatments that removed my pigmentation, botox, overall a good daily skincare regimen). I am really lucky though to not have fine lines as I actually used tan in the tanning bed!!!    I do have sensitive skin and I want to make these last as long as possible LOL so I will likely do it 3 nights in a row to start then probably do it every other night. I'm getting filler on Saturday (it's a Thursday as I am writing this), so you can't really do much to your face after injectables. I probably wont use it again until later next week. I'm glad to get a jump start using it 3 nights in a row. Like I already said, I can't wait to see the results I get from this using it regularly.   Don't sleep on this one if you want glowing, radiant skin. And take it easy and space out your treatments, and moisturize really good afterwards especially if you have relatively sensitive skin like me."

They are a great pick me up for your skin when you feel like it's starting to look a little dull again. I do not have sensitive skin in the least so the extra strength did not bother me. I posted a comparison photo of Day 1 vs Day 10. I took both pics in the same spot in my bathroom so a change in lighting wouldn't affect the comparison.

Definitely helped my skinu2019s texture, helped decongested my pores and clear a lot of the surface acne. Around weeks 3-4 youu2019ll notice a lot of acne as your face is purging (look it up!) so donu2019t feel disappointed. However the purging cleared up and my face only stayed semi-clear even after being religious with my skin care routines plus this product (day and night, spf 50, the whole jazz). I did more research into my skin type (rosacea, very red with acne) and learned that retinol is what is most recommended for acne (donu2019t worry itu2019s also an exfoliate!) and niacinamide for scarring and redness. After I started using those my skin is totally clear except for some blackheads, see Week 7. The Inkey List has a great niacinamide serum, or I use The Ordinaryu2019s 100% Niacinamide Powder and mix it with the Marine Hyluronics serum in the morning. At night I use La Roche-Posayu2019s Retinol B3 serum (B3 is niacinamide) and for extra acne fighting also La Roche-Posay Effaclar Duo Global Action Acne Treatment. If you are to buy one of these products I recommend the last La Roche-Posay product, itu2019s a cream and has always made my skin better within the same day. The Dr. Dennis Gross peel is good but it is expensive and wonu2019t fully treat your acne if itu2019s really stubborn. Do some research or watch dermatologist skin care videos. Also, recognize that your skin will never look airbrushed as pores and acne are totally normal. Make changes in your diet and exercise and use products that target your skincare goals and needs of your skin type, I promise it will work! And if you have acne, hang in there!! Itu2019s taken 10 years for me to find what keeps my skin clear and consistent"

I was hoping this would minimize my large pores on my forehead and cheeks and help clear skin of acne and dark spots from acne scaring. In a nutshell I discontinued use of this product after 3 days of daily use. Initial thoughts when I applied it, I felt a tiny bit of tingling and my face got semi red which went away after an hour. I did my treatments at night before I went to bed. Every morning after I started using them I noticed my skin was super oily on my forehead and cheek area, which is never is like that when I wake up. I have combination skin, but itu2019s less on the oily side. It literally looked like I just worked out and had sweat on my forehead from that.. which I had not. I continued treatment for several days and tried to just ignore the oil my skin was suddenly producing overnight. But after day 3 of waking from use it just seemed to be getting even worse than the days before so I read the bad reviews here.. wish I had read more of them before because many people said it caused them acne, which was my big concern when I noticed how oily it was making me. Over the 3 days I noticed no change in my pore size or skin quality besides the excess oil in the morning. Iu2019ve attached a photo of day 1 before and after I applied the peel wipes. The 3rd photo at top is the last morning when I woke up, my acne was heeling no different than without using this product and although the lighting isnu2019t good you can see how shiny my forehead was when I woke up. So from my short time using it I wouldnu2019t recommend this product. Maybe it would be better over time but the excess oil on my forehead made me worried it would mess my skin up. After I stopped use the oiliness went away.  * just FYI: I followed the directions exactly, washed my face prior, & added my Clinique moisturizer after as directed."

She has been pushing me to try this for several months but I've tried other acid peels at various price points (from the Ordinary to Drunk Elephant) with minimal changes to my acne-prone, scarred, oily skin with only minimal changes so I was skeptical. However, I got a sample of 3 peels which prompted me to purchase this size after noticing amazing improvements to my skin. I used to be so oily after 4-6 hours post-washing my face (like I would get oil into my eyelids and would soak through Starbucks napkins easily) but this product has really changed that. I'm no longer oily by the end of the day, and if anything, actually more on the dry side now. This is the only product I have used that has actually SMOOTHED out my pockmarked skin and made some of those boxcar and icepick scars less noticeable. I had been planning to get microneedling and in-office peels but COVID threw a wrench in that, but now I feel like this is an excellent substitute for the fraction of the price. My boyfriend noticed an immediate effect after 2 uses. I started with using it once a week and now am at 2-3 times a week. This product does burn but it's over after a few minutes. The other acid peels I have used have been much more painful and discouraged me from using. I am going to finish up this box and see how my skin is but I am excited with all the changes I have already seen. I think if you struggle with acne scarring, this is a product you should consider!"

After the first use, the dry patches were gone, the skin glows like I'm illuminated from the inside,  and it feels baby bum soft and smooth. I use it once/week when the dryness and dullness begins to return. I think it would be too much (not to mention pricey) to use this every day when you aren't trying to treat specific issues. But it makes an incredible difference, even with good skin. I made all my girlfriends buy this, and each one has experienced a great improvement in their specific concerns (acne, dryness, etc)."

I first started to apply the product (skin peel regular) and noticed my face became bright red so I backed off using this product on my second peel (two weeks apart). After a week my skin continued to peel so I went to Fuchsia Spa and saw a licensed facial expert (esthetician) . She inquired about the products I was using leading up to the peel. Apparently, there are instructions on a pre peel and an after peel. I had implemented the use of retinol in my nightly routine as well as my toner, and AHA. which are apparently not supposed to happen before you peel. Also after the peel, you are supposed to only use moisturizer and there is after care. This was never mentioned on your product line and should be implemented so women like me don't suffer! Thanks."

I came across these and decided to buy the smallest pack (at first), I honestly wasnu2019t sure if I wanted this to work considering the price lol. It took a single treatment for me to hop on and order a bigger pack of them.   I donu2019t use mine everyday (although I could), I find using these extra strength ones every other morning is perfect for my needs. I bought these to help with my overall skin texture and 1-2 lines in my forehead. The initial results were good, but continuous use has produced results like I havenu2019t seen with ANYTHING else Iu2019ve tried (thatu2019s including Ordinaryu2019s peeling solution, Farmacyu2019s Honeymoon Glow, Drunk Elephants baby facial, or Sunday Riley Good Genes). This is the first product I can truly say is a SKIN-CHANGING item.   My skin is softer and smoother than itu2019s ever been, Iu2019ve noticed my pore size isnu2019t nowhere near as noticeable, and Iu2019ve had not a single breakout since the initial 2 weeks of starting these. I will warn that I did have 2 cystic bumps pop up on my chin and a few small whitehead type pimples pop up as well in that first 2 weeks, but they went away pretty quickly and I know thatu2019s just part of introducing new products to your skin (especially something like this that chemically exfoliates and encourages turnover).   Using a treatment every other AM, this 35 pack lasts over 2 months making it roughly $40/mth cost....and honestly? Even if I had to replace these monthly I would. $80 is a small price to pay to have skin you are confident in.   If you have more problematic skin or have more severe issues, donu2019t be discouraged if you donu2019t see immediate miracle results like others have seen. Be patient and continue to use as directed, I promise it works!"

So, my dermatologist put me on some antibiotics and a benzoyl peroxide topical and the second photo here was the result of that. My self esteem plummeted, my quality of life dropped. Thank goodness weu2019re in quarantine or else I donu2019t know how I wouldu2019ve been able to cope. My dermatologist then wanted to put me on accutane after the mess these other products caused and I refused. I wanted to take control and treat it myself. Fast forward to now, the after picture is almost a miracle to me. Itu2019s only been about a month apart. I have almost no active acne left and just scarring. These peel pads are the only things that have worked. I use these nightly in conjunction with their pore shrinking serum and exfoliating cream (not on Sephora anymore?) as well as some caudalie products in the AM. I know that this product in particular has made the biggest impact of all though. All I can say is that Iu2019m extremely grateful for this and the price tag doesnu2019t even matter to me considering the effectiveness of it.

I do have dry skin, so using a peel like this is perhaps not ideal for my skin type, but I didn't experience dryness or irritation beyond the redness. I wish there was the option to buy these without the added fragrances and botanical extracts/oils to see if it was potentially less irritating. They are convenient to use at home and while traveling and are potentially worth a try if you have money to spare."

YOU ABSOLUTELY NEED TO ADD MOISTURE TO YOUR ROUTINE WHILE USING THIS. Those that have reported red splotches and flaky skin did not have enough moisture in their routine, these are very drying. You need to have a hyaluronic acid but you canu2019t just have that, you NEED to have an occlusive moisturizer otherwise the hyaluronic isnu2019t going to do anything for you and your skin will pull moisture from itself. SO these are great but only if you supplement your skin with the moisture it needs while you use these intense acids."

One was the universal and the other was extra strength. I wanted to know if my skin would be able to handle it and to ease it carefully into my routine by starting off with the universal before working my way to the extra strength. I recommend this method to see if you want to go through with the treatment since it is an expensive product. Luckily I was seeing results and the irritation level wasnu2019t high, so I decided to go ahead and do a month trial. As you can see my skin to the left was when I first started out. I suffered mainly from dark hyperpigmentation, an active pimple, plus a blind cystic underskin one. I used this product EVERY DAY, only at night. I think itu2019s why my results were fairly decent for only one month. Since this was a u2018daily peelu2019 I wanted to stick to the instructions and consistently use it for max results. And to that I say, if your skin can handle it DO IT. Itu2019s why I stress the importance of doing the small 5 packs first. Really build up your tolerance if you can before you buy the month pack. Adding this into my daily routine caused some changes, letu2019s talk about it.  (1) My skin used to be extremely oily, sure enough it quickly became dry. Which means, moisturizer!! What I found worked best for my skin was hyaluronic acid+aloe serum (from Fortify+), artemisia squalane hydra cream (from Aprilskin), fighter gel (Banish) (2) There is a redness left over from the treatment, although it does fade after around 30-60min. Just a reminder sunscreen is extremely important, I use the algenist sublime defense SPF 50 at night & in the morning.  (3) I never wore base makeup & washed my skin every morning and night with the Kate S. acne sulfur wash. If my skin was extra dry I used my Calendula Aprilskin cleanser.  Takeaways: Improved texture, brightened skin, lightened my dark acne HP, & helped calm my cystic acne."

The first peel Iu2019ve ever done was with Philosophy, and I had to return it because my skin had a reaction. Going forward, Iu2019ve been extremely cautious when it came to putting harsh chemicals on my face. A few months ago, I suffered from terrible hormonal, cystic acne on my cheeks. I never broke out on my cheeks before, and they left nasty scars and hyperpigmentation. I was so bummed because even makeup didnu2019t do a great job at covering them up. At that point, I felt desperate, so I decided to give these peels a try. I made sure to take photos after every three uses to make sure it wasnu2019t some sort of placebo effect. I was shocked to see what my skin looked like after the 5th use. The hyperpigmentation on my cheeks began fading (noticeably, too). My skin began repairing itself from the trauma of me picking and popping my cystic acne. On top of all that, the enlarged pores around my nose began shrinking. I use these peels at night, as the skin repairs itself the best over night. Every morning I was shocked to look in the mirror. My skin looked glossy and fresh. Iu2019ve always had an issue with dullness. For the first time in my life, I felt genuinely happy about my skin. This never caused breakouts, reactions, rashes, etc. Now I canu2019t see a life without these peels. Take a chance and try it for yourself!"

These are strong and if your skin is sensitive, don't come crying when you get red patches because this is the extra strength ones. you have to try the gentle ones or the universal ones if you don't want your skin to have a bad time. I see a lot of misconception because people unknowingly used these ones without proper research thinking the reviews is all the knowledge they need.   Even when your skin is not overly sensitive, I suggest using these things sparingly. Only do it in severe cases or when you're recovering from a breakout because they'll wipe your face of those nasty little scars and dents you got from popping things too soon.  I generally use these whenever I feel that my skin has gotten rough in texture and the results are much better than any vitamin C serums I can snag off the shelves. There is the tingly burning sensation and that's when I know it's working, but do not leave it on the face for too long because generally that's when things get a bit painful.  In the end this is a dermatology grade item and should be used with care. Patch test, learn what your skin type is, learn what your skin can handle and be gentle with it. Give your skin the time and love it deserves if you want your results."

Over FaceTime vs in real life, it was noticeable how this peel has transformed my skin. I still have my acne scars and I will still keep using this because I feel like itu2019ll eventually get rid of all of them. Fingers crossed!

Step one is pretty strong as far as smell goes. Hits me right in the sinuses. Step 2 smells faintly like actual perm neutralizer but not unbearable. Neither scent is a deal breaker for me. Mask life has been unkind to my skin as it has many others and my chin and mouth area have been super congested. After just one use of these I could already tell that the exfoliation was beginning to remove some of the little bumps I have been unable to extract. Anyway yes these are expensive but worth it if you are having skin issues. I hope after a few more uses i look 20 again."

Yes, I know this is called an extra strength peel, but having had quasi-torturous peels from a dermatologist, and being acclimated to acids in general, this product does not sting or burn at all because my skin is used to more.  But this is not a knock on this product at all--quite the contrary.  I don't think strong acids are good on a daily basis, and this is an effective, gentle way to exfoliate and get rid of dead skin so that our other products perform even better.  Highly recommend!"

Just need to put on a SPF 30 or higher. I will say exfoliating in the AM is great because makeup looks better. Now for the price... if you use these every day, the 30+5 box is about a month's supply. For the same price or cheaper, you can get other holy grail AHA+BHA toners on the market that will last much longer. The only catch is that without the neutralizing pads, if you use retinol, you have to wait for your skin to neutralize either by doing acids in the AM and retinol in the PM, or wait like 30min in between. So maybe after this box, I'll reconsider and use these pads on special occasions because of the price. They are SUPER convenient for travelling though!"

I started using this $200 serum with vitamin C E & ferulic because I had heard great things, and it helped, but still the congestion & that one pimple wouldnu2019t leave. Seriously, itu2019s been weeks. Then I remembered that the Dr. Dennis Gross pads have in the past helped my skin tremendously to exfoliate and eliminate congestion, I donu2019t know why i forgot about these. So I bought them and in ONE USE that annoying pimple is completely flat and my skin already looks better. I think this is a treatment I need to do like once a year like teeth whitening strips just for upkeep and then the regular masks and serums can do their job, this is like my deep clean and reset. I donu2019t even think Iu2019ll need to do the entire 35 treatments, maybe just 10-14 Now and the rest in a couple of weeks or months as needed.  Highly recommend!"

These pads can be used daily even at extra strength. I have not noticed excessive drying. Convenient packaging that doesnu2019t allow the pads to dry out. Iu2019m already on my second box.

I have combo skin and since using this product I have not had any dry skin at all (I do the peel followed by serum and moisturizer). My skin is still oily but that's nothing I can't manage with oil sheets.  I used the product daily during the trial and loved it so much that I bit the bullet and purchased the 30 +5 bundle. With the cost, it is quite the little indulgence. I won't be continuing to use the product daily, as I feel I would see similar results using the product twice a week or so. I'm sure I'll be a lifer with this product.  Highly recommend!"

I always keep an eye on Sephora for promos or when these are apart of the rewards and stock up cause they aren't cheap.

Itu2019s pricy (understatement!), but I buy the extra strength and use it 1-2x/week. The package of 60 lasts me all year, or close to it. More often than twice a week, and my skin just feels overprocessed.   The results are worth the cost. My skin (normal, no major issues, mid-thirties - so, normal aging stuff) has never looked better - glowy and smooth. Makeup applies better, but my skin also looks better without makeup - I donu2019t even own a full-coverage foundation anymore, just some light CC options (Dr. Jart!).   I typically use pretty gentle products, but my skin also isnu2019t particularly sensitive. The extra strength may be too much for more sensitive skin.   I started with a sample pack of 5 treatments and was hooked. Iu2019ve been using this peel now for two years. Try it!"

I don't have acne that much, just some tiny bumps all over and a few scars. Always end up ditching my new products as soon as i break out, because I don't know if they caused it but they sure never do anything, so i go back to basics. But THIS STUFF. Makes me want to start doing yoga and get my life together. I look like i drink 1L of water a day but I don't. This stuff is soo expensive though.. I bought the 5 pack and i def noticed my skin being brighter & smoother. It isn't a miracle, my skin doesn't look photoshopped or anything but I feel more confident about it. It feels smoother to the touch too. I say anyone should start with the 5 pack to see if they like it before splurging!"

I then purchased these assuming the benefits would be intensified as the treatment is stronger, but didnu2019t find that to be the case. Regardless, I didnu2019t experience any significant improvement that warranted adding this item to my daily routine for longer than the box lasted (35 treatments).   I used one pad daily, but did experiment with cutting them in half at one point. If this is something that helps your skin, I could definitely see only needing half.

Iu2019ve tried so many products (serums, acne patches, brightening cream, acne targeted face wash and lotion, etc) but I saw no results with those products after 3 months of use. Admittedly, I also have a problem with popping and picking at my skin so it made my scars even more tough to get rid of. I was hesitant to do an at home peel just because I feel like anything with harsh chemicals, I should see a specialist for it. I was desperate and decided to purchase this AND BOY AM I GLAD I DID!!! Iu2019m 3.5 weeks into using this and 95% of my acne scars have cleared away. YES EVEN THE TOUGH SCARS CAUSED BY MY OBSESSIVE PICKING!   I used this as instructed on the package. I used it everyday with one day break at the end of the week.   Iu2019m also trying to be better about picking my acne and I think this also helps clear away the acne faster, too. I had a painful red one and it went away within a few days. As opposed to before, itu2019d stay there and get bigger after a week.   I will be repurchasing and will see if I can use it every other day or every 2 days instead.   The pores on my nose and on the sides of my nose are noticeable. After using this, it did bring up all the gunk that was underneath. It looks cleaner now but my pores are still visible. However, this is the least of my concern as I am using this to help with my breakouts and scars.   A plus though, my skin is GLOWING and is so soft! I donu2019t remember the last time it was like this. I was also very dependent on makeup, and now I feel confident to walk out with just concealer.   I love this. I definitely do think it is worth the try!"

Will not buy again.  I'll keep trying with The Ordinary HAs. I stopped using the glycolic toner because it irritated my skin, but honestly for $12 or whatever it costs vs. almost $90, it is definitely worth it to keep trying with The Ordinary to find what acid works best for your skin."

I went a few days without using it this past week and my skin was looking smooth, glowy and no new cystic acne so I thought it would be okay for me to give this a go. Oh was I WRONG, next day my skin was a bumpy mess and got a new painful pimple coming in, not to mention the awful oiliness.  I'm giving it 3 stars because it does work to fade old scars but it's not worth it for me if it's going to keep giving me acne, I think this is just sending my skin into overdrive mode but I can totally see how it can do wonders for other people.   Buy the smaller pack first and try it out for a week, don't be like me and get stuck with the bigger box in case it doesn't work."

My skin actually felt raw after applying both wipes until it used all the product on them...and my skin isn't at all sensitive so that's really saying something. Then I tried cutting each wipe in half and that's what works best for me! I put the remaining half back in the package, fold it over, and store it overnight in a sealed snack size Ziploc bag and it's still moist the next day. I still get amazing results from using half of each wipe and, as a bonus, it lasts me twice as long :) I use this at night and follow up with a light moisturizer and Caudalie Vinoperfect Serum. I'm 45 and have adult cystic acne and this helps with age spots, wrinkles, texture, and helps control my breakouts. I just bought the full size and the price was a lot easier to swallow knowing that it will last me two months instead of one. My sister also uses this to control the breakouts she gets from wearing PPE full-time as a healthcare professional."

My skin felt and looked smoother, glowier, more even-toned, bouncier.  The product itself has a nice green apple scent.  I only gave it 3/5 because if someone were to ask me I'd be meh about it.  A few minuses:  1 - the rubbing motion that you use to actually apply the product to your face sometimes makes my skin feel really sensitive and leads to more of a burning sensation when applying it.  2 - my cheeks were always red afterwards for about an hour or so, and that's after applying toner, moisturizer, and sunscreen. 3 - I don't like fussy routines, and the instructions say to wait 2 minutes in between the first and the second wipe... I like to be in and out in the mornings so that is a bit of a minus for me!  Finally, like the title says, I just don't think the price is worth it.  I've been using Moon Juice's Acid Potion which is also a mix of 3 acids (glycolic, lactic, and salicylic) priced at $42 for 100mL and that lasts me WAY more than 35 days (assuming the 30+5 bonus size, $88 priced Alpha Beta is used daily).    Bottom line, there's no way to use all the product in the wipes and if you're paying close to $100 for one month's worth of product then you should be able to wring those babies out onto your face!  Moon Juice has practically the same product for much cheaper, and I've experienced identical results using it."

I've had hormonal acne since I've been alive, and this treatment is exactly what I needed! I have old acne scars and hyper pigmentation, and this treatment addressed that perfectly! After about a week or so, I noticed smoother, healthier, and just better looking skin! I recommend this to anyone that is suffering from acne or did at some time.

IT'S BEEN THREE DAYS AND MY SKIN IMPROVEMENT is noticeable on a high degree. It is killing off my current hormonal acne bout, has reduced my laugh lines and my skin tone is already starting to look more even. THREE DAYS?! IS THAT EVEN SCIENTIFICALLY POSSIBLE?! Either way, I'm sold. Loyally. My only in depth commentary would be as it peels layers of dead skin, some black heads look more prominent and need to be extracted - but it's not creating any kind of inflammation or infection, etc. not sure if that's common for others too. I remember this happening last time as well. 10/10, cant wait for my 60 day end result."

But after two weeks, my face was feeling irritated using the pads so I stopped for another two weeks and focused on hydrating my skin. Now, I use the pads every 3 days as the exfoliant in my night time routine (this also helps the pads last longer, I have 4 more left and I made the purchase in April). My hormonal acne is pretty much gone and now I'm working on getting rid of the hyperpigmentation it left behind. This product is worth the investment though I hate the price tag. I'm contemplating buying this again during the winter VIB sale so that I always have them around for acne and hyperpigmentation prevention."

Again, as an experienced peeler and user of all the things, I was dubious...Fast forward to morning after first use: I could not be more impressed. I'm 35 with very minimal wrinkles, acne, and relatively even skin tone - or so I thought! You know how people always talk about looking glowing and even and dewy?! Yeah, I was actually glowing. I get it now. I woke up and my skin was flawless. I look 10 years younger. I've used them every night since, still dubious, waiting for some sort of adverse reaction to happen - nothing. I was also doubtful because they don't feel that wet with product and I want my face slathered...but whatever formulation they use is magic. I can't stress that enough. I follow with my moisturizer or serum, and I wake up and my skin is actually Hollywood celebrity level radiant in the morning. If that didn't convince you: We're in the middle of a pandemic and I took a pay cut - and I still just bought the full size box."

WORTH EVERY PENNY! I started double cleansing and using these peel pads at the end of January 2020. My skin has transformed completely the last 6 months. Started off 3x/week, got up to 5x/week, and am back down to 2-3x/week. Only get an occasional break out now. I could cry every time I look at my before/after.

My skin did not burn or peel, did I did find that it seemed to glow. Also, my regular moisturizer layered well with this product, again, my skin did not burn or seem irritated at all.

Uncomfortable, yes, but it is difficult to find something that exfoliates but is gentle and actually works for any amount of acne. That's where Dr. Dennis's Gross skincare comes in. I tried a sample of these extra strength wipes and saw results right away after only using them for a few days in a row. Some acne scars and bumpiness that I had such a hard time getting rid of with other products, faded, leaving my cheeks and sides of my face where I was beginning to feel particularly insecure about, looked more even and clean like they used to. Now, using something labeled extra strength when you have sensitive skin can be a bit daunting, but it is very effective on acne and acne scars it seems. It definitely tickled my skin but never hurt or burned, as I used the wipes there was the initial face irritation being rubbed and all, but the results were surprising and pleasant. So I would say, these are worth trying if you are someone who just can't find something that really works for you. It can really change your face, even if you can't commit to the price of using them for the rest of your life. I would say the price is the only major downside to this product. And the fact that its wipes that you regularly have to throw away, which is not particularly environmentally friendly. This might just be for you, and well, there are ones designed for different issues that I personally have not tried, but they might be even better for daily use. Overall, a good product to combat skin unevenness."

As for exfoliation or dead skin removal, I don't think it does much of that at all. I don't dislike the way it makes my face feel cleaner and a little brighter, but  I don't know if it's actually the peels or me being proud of myself for putting in the effort to peel. It's a bit refreshing, I suppose, but I don't really think it does much. Fine lines, pores, skin firmness and texture are all the same. It's a decent product in that there are no noticeable negative effects. It just didn't perform like I had hoped. I've been using wipes on my face and decolletage area, as well as on a patch of sunburned skin on my knee. (Random, I know--but I was wearing ripped jeans and now have a silly-looking knee tan like a stripe.) I bought these pads to split between my face and my sad little knee patch. And having swiped the exfoliant on my knee skin daily for almost two months, I can say that there has been literally NO SHIFT whatsoever in the removal of any dead, burned skin cells. It's not a huge deal and the patch is small, but I just thought I'd test out the strength of this peel in more than one area. Also experimented using this on a couple of acne scars on my back. The wipes did nothing. And unfortunately, the feel-good effect they have on my feelings about my face is the most I'm getting out of them. But hey, counts for something. Three stars!"

Honestly haven't found a better product and frankly don't feel a need to really search for one.    My tip to save $$: you can maximize the product if you are careful with opening the top, and just use the exterior sides of each wipe, place each back in the container, clip it shut, and then just reopen and open up and use the interior of the wipes the next day.  There is easily two days' worth of product in each packet."

I use it 3x a week and donu2019t need any other exfoliating products. You donu2019t want to irritate the skin by over exfoliating, which I think maybe be the reason some have had reactions. I always use very soothing serums and moisturizer after this product. Itu2019s easy to use, quick, and effective. Itu2019s worth the price. I love that you can try the smaller pack before investing, which I would recommend. This will always be in my regimen."

Uncomfortable, yes, but it is difficult to find something that exfoliates but is gentle and actually works for any amount of acne. That's where Dr. Dennis's Gross skincare comes in. I tried a sample of these extra strength wipes and saw results right away after only using them for a few days in a row. Some acne scars and bumpiness that I had such a hard time getting rid of with other products, faded, leaving my cheeks and sides of my face where I was beginning to feel particularly insecure about, looked more even and clean like they used to. Now, using something labeled extra strength when you have sensitive skin can be a bit daunting, but it is very effective on acne and acne scars it seems. It definitely tickled my skin but never hurt or burned, as I used the wipes there was the initial face irritation being rubbed and all, but the results were surprising and pleasant. So I would say, these are worth trying if you are someone who just can't find something that really works for you. It can really change your face, even if you can't commit to the price of using them for the rest of your life. I would say the price is the only major downside to this product. And the fact that its wipes that you regularly have to throw away, which is not particularly environmentally friendly. This might just be for you, and well, there are ones designed for different issues that I personally have not tried, but they might be even better for daily use. Overall, a good product to combat skin unevenness."

After the first wipe, you wait 2 minutes, in which I would brush my teeth. Then step 2 is applied just like the first. This step is a neutralizer and seems to leave a film on your skin. It says you can apply other serums before moisturizer but I only applied moisturizer. I have only used this product twice (once a week) but maybe with more use, I would see the long term benefits."

I have bad acne that is totally tied to my emotions and I am going through a break out currently, Rental remodels can be nooo fun. I was hoping going in that it would magically wipe away my acne, it definitely helped move along the healing process faster. I used the 3 days of 2 packets, 3 days in a row at night after my shower. Rubbing on the first wipe till it dried up and then the second wipe after 2 minutes till it dried up as well, and then leaving it on my face over night till I would wash my face in the morning. Itu2019s been a week now since I used the set and my acne has definitely cleared up more quickly with the help of this sample pack. The rest of my skin that isnu2019t acne, is 34 and beginning to show some age, looks so much smother and fresher now. These wipes are great. Canu2019t wait to pick up a full pack now."

It only comes with 5 treatments so I cut the wipes in half so I stretched it out to ten treatments and got amazing results. My active acne was basically gone and it helped my problem areas from having more. I used it every other day like the instructions said and made sure to hydrate my face afterwards and apply sunscreen because I did not want to risk harming my skin from a more harsh peel. There was a period where my skin got flaky because it was being dried out, but I used the CeraVe healing ointment in addition to it and my skin barrier was perfectly fine. I HIGHLY recommend this to anyone who has recently dealt with cystic acne."

I did notice that my acne flair up wasnt nearly as bad as it normally is. However I did still have flair ups it didn't really prevent acne which was disappointing. Honestly I cant say I had any kind of extraordinary results I mean I've got similar results from using witch hazel, and toners. I think was pretty hyped up but in the end I think I would probably stick with my toners. I mean if I can get the same results I might as well spend less than 5% percent of how much this costs. The plus side is they would be perfect for traveling as they are small and in a packet. I imagine most airports wouldn't have any problems with them and they take up very minimal space."

They weren't harsh on my skin at all and made my face look and feel amazing. I would definitely reccomend this product to anyone. I will add this to my skincare routine from now."

I could not have been more wrong about that!  First, I washed my face with a cream based facial wash then patted. 2nd, used step  one of the package and let it dry before moving on to step two.  Afterwards my face had a glow, which I cannot explain except for the fact that it was because of this peel.  I do not have sensitive skin so I'm not sure if this would irritate someone who does.  On a side note, I have used a Vitamin D serum from Dr Dennis Gross in the past which I cannot find anywhere and I swear that got rid of my dark spots.  Anywho this product I will be using often.  Thank you!"

I only used it 3 days in a row and I saw a big difference on my skin and it felt so good. The scent is really subtle BUT it does have an alcohol like smell/air to it, which made me cough a lot. That being said that's one of the product's downside. Also the fact that each pad comes in a single use plastic bag is something that I am not fond of therefore I will not be buying this product. Besides all that, it is a product that works. My skin felt sooo good. I'd recommend it to those who won't mind about the plastic use and the alcohol like smell."

Not what I expected with my skin sensitivity, but I donu2019t want to harm my skin either by using this back to back either since it claims itu2019s extra strength. If I had a weeks worth to test might be able to see results that I can actually give.  These are small like a moist towelette sized. No fragrance.

I wiped and re-wiped my face, then my neck area, with both packets, and the towelettes never felt like they got to a point where they got dry as the instructions stated. I find the instruction to wipe the towelettes until they dry out to be unrealistic. I think the point should be rather to apply it liberally and adequately to your facial area to ensure the product is spread on evenly and gets absorbed. Both felt nice going on.

Not only were my pores much tighter, appearing smaller, but my skin was so soft and has a nice glow. It had a beautiful brightening effect on my skin. Because I received the extra strength I didn't want to overdo it so I only used it once a day every other day so it lasted me about a week. It did not aggravate my skin whatsoever. It does tingle a little and it does smell terrible, very medicinal, but the smell is literally the only negative I can think of. There was a visible improvement in my pores and texture, my skin looks smoother, feels more hydrated, and honestly it just looks much better. To see such a noticeable Improvement after just three uses I think is pretty miraculous. It's easy to apply, once a day just massage the step one pad on clean and dry skin until dry, wait 2 minutes and do the same with step number two. And that's. It's that simple! I found this stuff to honestly be quite a game-changer for my skin. I definitely recommend this stuff. There is a peel for everyone from an Ultra Gentle daily peel to the Extra Strength version so you really can't go wrong. So what are you waiting for??? Take the peel challenge! It is the number one at home peel! you won't be disappointed."

I used it three times, following the 3rd usage I did notice a bit more flakiness, but my skin otherwise looked amazing. Much clearer, more even texture and tone. I would definitely consider using again, maybe as a every 6 week or quarterly treatment. Doesnu2019t smell bad either.

I bought this because I wanted an intense anti-aging treatment to potentially slow down the aging process and help my skin maintain a youthful and healthy appearance. This product is perfection. My skin has never looked or felt better. This product does it all. My face is soft, silky, smooth... it glows.. my fine lines have diminished. I feel like a new person after using this treatment. I have never used a peel like this before and I have combination skin, leaning dry - that being said, I realize this product is intended to be used daily, but I only use it once a week - and my results are still amazing! I do experience a slight tingling sensation while applying the first step of the product, but the tingling subsides after 30 seconds or so. I donu2019t experience any sort of u201csensationu201d when applying the second step; it just feels nice and gentle on my skin after the intense peel. The product doesnu2019t smell great - it smells kind of chemically - but itu2019s not overwhelming or irritating to me. I have so enjoyed this product and truly believe it is worth the price! I will continue to use this product as long as I can get my hands on it! Highly recommend!"

I can attest to my own experience with the application. Itss nice that it's mess free with pre-soaked cotton pads...but it seems a bit wasteful. The 1st step pre-soaked towelette has a strong chemical smell. My face tingled a bit but then began to burn shortly after I started the application. The 2nd step didn't have the same strong chemical odor. But it still does burn during application. My face hasn't reacted to the burning by turing red. So lucky for that considering this is extra strength. After the application I'm left with shiny/dewy and soft complexion. But my acne prone skin and scars are still there. Still visible. Can't expect a miracle in 3 days I guess"

Step 1 burned a little while it worked, but step 2 calms it down. The next day, one of my newly forming pimples was completely wiped out, like it never even existed! I still have one monster of a pimple in the third eye area, so FYI it wasn't an instant cure-absolutely-all, but I'm hoping a couple more days of this product kill the nasty thing.   Overall, I'm very impressed so far."

I took the towlette out the pack and began to apply to my face in circle motion until it was almost dry. Step 1 completed in less than 3mins. I immediately felt the oil being lifted from my face and a firming feeling began. I started with step 2. Completed within 3 to 4 minutes applying in a circled motion until dry. My skin feels clean and firm. Also is noticeably clean and firm looking. As i did this routine for a few more days i see my skin changing and becoming clearer, firmer. My lines around my lips are less noticable. So my review is this product does work. If you are searching for a almost instant then you need to try this product out. Also its cruelty free,veganfree, and no harsh add ins."

So I got the DAILY universal peels first 30 day. Seemed to help some and I didnt have any bad reactions, but progress was not great after two weeks. So I upped it to extra strength.  Within the first use I was breaking out all over again. So I stopped and went back to my universal dailies. Skin started to clear up.   Then I tried to go back again to extra strength. BREAKING OUT AGAIN.  Sticking to the universal ones. Hopefully I'll see better difference otherwise I don't get the hype of this product."

My skin is lot healthier and has a glow to it on the third day and just looked 100% better.

Second treatment smelled alot better. They were extremely easy to use/apply and I didn't experience any burning sensation or any discomfort while or after using. Within just 2 hours after my first treatment I noticed how much more incredibly soft and smooth my skin felt. After using my 3rd treatment all the tiny small under skin bumps on my forehead was completely gone and I was sold on these. My forehead hasn't been this smooth and bump free in years! I'm definitely gonna be a loyal user of these from now on. Definitely one of my all time holy grail products ever! Don't waste any time thinking about trying and just do it. You'll thank me."

No burning or stinging. Not sticky. After 2 minutes just massage in the second packet which is an Anti-Aging Neutralizer.  My skin is softer and smoother after this product.  Seemed like my skin tone also was brighter.  I recommend this Dr Dennis Gross product to look your best.  Makes my skin feel great.  Thank you."

I used the treatment one night while watching a movie, then waited two days before using the second treatment. I did not feel any sensation on my skin, but my skin is not particularly sensitive. Step 1 smelled very acidic, and almost made me wonder whether or not I should put it on the vulnerable skin of my face. I did, and boy am I glad! Step 2 did not have a noticeable smell and helped soothe the skin after Step 1. After two treatments, my skin had cleared up entirely. I saved the 3rd treatment for when I see another breakout starting later on. The only reason I docked a star is because the treatments are so expensive. If I hadn't received this as a sample, I would never have tried it. And I won't be able to afford it in the future, so I am unable to purchase it moving forward."

I wouldn't say I have sensitive skin but it has reacted negatively to high-strength active ingredients in the past. (Kate Sommerville ExfoliKate burnt me to a crisp :( ) However, even with this being the Extra Strength version, all I saw was a bit of redness in response to application. My skin, after using three treatments over the course of a week and a half, feels smoother and looks more even toned than before! Please note that sometimes it will get worse before it gets better... my skin did purge, not everyone's skin will because we're all different, but I did get breakouts worse in places where I normally have them under control. It brought all the crap underneath my skin to the surface. All in all, great product. Price is a bit expensive but with all the clinical ingredients, I understand why."

I noticed my makeup applied flawlessly that day. I followed with the last application the next night and when I awoke that next morning, I was amazed at my appearance. My acne and dark spots had almost completely disappeared. My face was bright and radiant and my pores were definitely smaller. My skin felt transformed in every way imaginable.  Needless to say, I was SOLD! I am patiently waiting for this product to come back in stock so I can purchase immediately. Although it is a bit costly, I figure itu2019s well worth it for all that it done for me and with being able to replace all the other products I typically purchase and use daily. If you suffer from lines/wrinkles, acne/dark spots, and dull/ dry skin I promise you will not regret spending the money on Dr. Dennis Gross Alpha Beta extra strength daily peels! Life changing!!"

By the time that she had completed the three days, there was clearly an improvement in her acne. Her skin seemed to have a more matte finish, and we think that it improved some of the scarring that she has. She shortly thereafter moved to a new city, but told me that she's purchased the product and that her face has never been better. She said that she has to wait a full 24 hours between use, or her face gets a little bit irritated. There is a little odor to the product, but goes away quickly after application. We are really impressed!"

I've never done a peel pad before, or any peels and did some research online before using them after seeing that these peels are very low strength. These were great on my skin and didn't cause any peeling like other peels do mainly since these are a at home peel. I have sensitive combo skin and after the first pad I used I saw immediate great results. It did give my skin a sunburned look right after but after using my kate somerville wrinkle warrior dermal quech spray with hyaluronic acid afterwards(use of HA after peels) helped plump my skin out and helped show off the results of the peel. My skin felt smoother so smooth and glowing. I ordered a 5 pack immediately after trying my samples and looking into doing stronger peel pads since these didn't seem to help with any breakouts but didn't make worse either. I recommend these for a deep exfoliation of the skin and anyone looking for help evening out your skin tone and lightening of dark pigment or spots on skin but with continued use of at least 7 or more probably."

Step 1 you use the wipe all over your face and let it dry. It is the chemical exfoliation to target pores, give radiance and re-texture. After a couple of minutes you can use Step 2. Wipe your face with that pad and let dry, do not rinse. Step 2 is the anti-aging neutralizer that soothes, repairs and hydrates. This does make your face feel really good and rejuvenated. But I have very sensitive skin and pretty much everything will make me breakout. This did too but not too bad. I think if I use it for longer it might have a chance to bring out all of the clogged pores that I have that are causing the breakouts and for once maybe get my face cleaned out.

            "review_text": "Great product but will I repurchase? No. Here's why:  When I purchased this, I was struggling with texture & maybe 2 or 3 breakouts but my skin was still mostly clear. I was hoping for a quick fix (hah yeah no). At the start, I used it every day to see how my skin would handle it at it's recommended usage and because I was so eager to see results. My skin got worse before it got better (even worse than what I started with) but I knew it was most likely because of purging, the retinol uglies (This was my first time using retinol) etc. so I continued. Around 2 weeks in, my skin started clearing up so I didn't feel the need to use the exfoliate step as much because I felt it was too stripping/unnecessary for daily use on my skin. So I switched to using the exfoliating step 2 days on 1 day off, but continued using the anti aging step on the day off (which I cut in half so it would even out).  I've now almost finished this product and although it didn't make a noticeable difference in my acne scarring it definitely helped clear my skin, made it more even, and made my pores less congested. Overall, I believe this is a great product to try out if your skin is really struggling (acne, texture or whatever it might be). It will help clear your skin and get it back on track. But if it's not that bad, I don't think it's worth it. Knowing what I know now, ill just be a bit more patient, and go back to using my salicylic cleanser, my lactic acid when my skin feels textured (The Ordinary's is awesome and it's only 7$) and purchase a high quality retinol instead. This way will be less harsh, cheaper and longer lasting. This is just my opinion and what I believe is best for my skin but hopefully it somewhat helps :)"

The first night,  I had a slight burning sensation and my face was really pink. The next day, didnu2019t really notice any difference. Second night, it still stings a bit but not too bad and slightly pink. The day, I did notice that my face wasnu2019t as dry as it was a few days before and it was also kind of soft. The 3rd night, still a bit of the stinging sensation and slight pink face. The next day, I face felt a lot better. It was still dry but it was so soft. Iu2019m sure if I continue itu2019ll keep getting better. The only reason I gave it a 4 stars is due to my face stinging. It did irritate my skin but I do like the results."

It's a two step process and it really gets the gunk and yuck off of your face so when you wake up in the morning your skin is cleaner and less break outs. It fades dark spots scars and shrinks acne. I think with long term use you could really see great improvement with your skin because everyday new skin sheds and cells build up on your face and on top of that you have dirt and oil that leads to black heads and its deep down. So this helps get that out everyday and makes your face less subjective to collect everything because you are constantly getting rid of the scum ! Easy to apply if you love having a skin routine this is great !"

There was no whitening of my skin or any dried out effect. I used Dr. Gross skincare for the next 2 days. It went wonderful. There was no more burning.

Also it has an ingredient that states you should wear sunscreen so be mindful of that before purchase. Great product!"

Great part is that there was no peeling or even micropeeling at all. I had used all 3 packs every other day and now that I am out of it, I had to order so I can continue. The aftereffects is nice.

Step 1 has a floral tea scent and breaks down all those rough patches and imperfections. Step 2 is practically scentless; but, if I had to describe a scent, it smells like purified water. It smoothes my skin and evens my skin tone. It's a quick way to improve my appearance. It's a nice product for people like me who've always liked to do things myself as opposed to making an appointment with an esthetician or dermatologist."
