It's expensive, but a little product goes a long way, so I don't have to repurchase very often. My biggest issue with this product is that the packaging tends to leak."

This concealer shade called Snow looked practically tan! And the shade description claims that it's for very fair skin with neutral to rosy undertones. I'm not seeing any of those descriptors in the concealer I've been using. I thought about trying the shades Cloud and Marshmallow (the lightest shades Too Faced offers which claim that they're for pinkish undertones), but honestly I don't know if that's worth the money.

I use it as a foundation because it sheers out nicely to a medium coverage with a beauty blender. I haven't had any problems with creasing. I have a mini in my car kit and will definitely repurchase this when I run out.  CONS: it is not as hydrating as I prefer, and will cling to dry/flaky skin - so you have to do your skin prep.

The coverage is amazing, it doesn't break me out in the slightest, and it lasts me ALL day. I have NEVER used a product which has lasted me 12 hours yet here we are and I would buy it over and over again! It is definitely water-based though which is a little saddening considering I have oily skin but after a long day, the oil looks more like a healthy glow ! I 100% recommend you to buy this, it is worth it."

I love trying concealers and have tried so many and I always come back to this one. it's longwearing, doesn't crease and has coverage. it wears well and doesn't become patchy by the end of the night. it's easy to blend and just overall an awesome formula. I have combo skin and this truly is the best that does it all. undereyes and all over the face, i dont even use foundation anymore and just spot concealer and this spreads so well and looks smooth on the skin. Will repurchase forever."

It's quite thick, highly pigmented and gives excellent full coverage which lasts up to 10 hours on my skin. As long as I've used setting powder after, and moisturized well before, I find only very minimal creasing or settling into lines as the day wears on. I mostly use it under the eye area - a pea size amount is more than sufficient. I also use it as a highlighter and to disguise the odd blemish. A little goes a very long way with this one and often I find I've applied more than I needed to. Not a fan of the doe foot applicator, it's too large for precise application (blemishes) although works well on larger surfaces such as under the eyes. The bottle too is large, it's literally the same size as a foundation bottle, perhaps the biggest concealer I've seen so you definitely get your money's worth here!    Got this in the 'Honey' shade which seemed fine when trying on in-store, however it seems somehow slightly darker once I got home and applied it. I usually switch to a lighter shade of both foundation and concealer during winter and in this case I will definitely have to. The only slight downside is; unlike my HG concealer (Mac Studio Finish) there's no SPF in here so I have to apply a sunblock separately, before concealer.  ~ My Sephora Top 7 must-have list ~  (My top 7 must-have beauty products of all time, focusing mainly on my purchases at Sephora)  1.

So, when I went into Sephora and was like u201chelp a girl out,u201d my lovely consultant was like, u201cIu2019ve got the thing for youu201d and did he ever. Of course I was skeptical, because Iu2019ve tried almost everything and it either doesnu2019t cover well or covers initially, but then wears off as the day goes on. Well, enter this gem of a product. I actually use this only as concealer, but itu2019s so amazing that it could be your foundation too.   I apply my foundation as a base and then use this for my troubled areas. Then I blend and you can see then disappear without looking cakey. I have never felt more confident. And I actually get it in a second color and use it for dimension as sort of contouring. Thank you, YouTube videos! Anyway, try this out and youu2019re welcome!"

Now iu2019m pale like usual only the second or third lightest shades of products and i have very pink undertones but i only prefer my concealer to be just a little bit lighter than my foundation. So i bought the second lightest shade (Marshmellow). First thing i was very surprised at was it said it had rosy undertones but found it has more of a neutral/yellow undertone to it. Once i put it on, blended and set it with powder it almost looked orangey on my skin. Went back to return it and unfortunately the lightest shade (Cloud) was too yellow for me as well. Honestly I gave it three stars because the product isnu2019t bad itu2019s just not for people with pink undertones. Hope this helps someone!"

You may ask how is that bad? It's because all my other makeup melts off, leaving an unclean and obvious edge under my eyes and anywhere else I put it that morning. I have to fix it post-workout (I wear makeup working out because I don't have time to take it off before).

Now as for the actual review, LIFE FREAKING SAVER!!! It looks like I have no acne, no blemishes NOTHING! Of course, you can see some texture here and there but hardly!!! I brush very little using the applicator on to the back of my hand into a thin layer and use my fingers to pat it over the entirety of my cheeks. The coverage is impeccable so usually I don't need to go over for a second layer unless I see some spots I missed or I go in with a beauty blender over it. I also sometimes just dab like three-ish dots and blend, once again using my fingers. I use a medium coverage foundation and use this everywhere that I need coverage, ending it with the MAC fix+ spray, and my makeup stays the entire day, mind you, I commute around 3 hours and 9 hour work days plus Tretinoin.

Other makeup can separate and look cakey on my nose area but this stuff does not.  It has buildable coverage and a little goes a long way.  ALSO, this lasts a decent amount of time! It's absolutely worth the price because there is more volume of product per container.  Only con is it sometimes has a strange smell."

If youu2019re super pale this one and the KVD concealer are the only ones that are lighter than anything youu2019ll find in the drugstore.  This one holds more product than the KVD concealer though. Doesnu2019t smell like candy like many too faced products do but thatu2019s fine lol.  Itu2019s higher coverage than the other concealer from Too Faced, but if you have dry skin and donu2019t want a ton of coverage that one might work better for you.  Shipped in half the time I expected, which I appreciate because my local Sephora has been out of this shade for a while.  Overall this product is a 10/10, highly recommend"

Coverage: HIGH coverage without needing too much product, which I absolutely love.

The Too Faced concealers coverage is exceptionally well compared to other brand-named concealers. It has excellent durability; therefore, less is needed to reapply. The value of this concealer can be costly to some customers, but it can be justified with the amount of product given. The Too Faced concealer is a concealer worth trying due to its coverage, durability, and value.   The Too Faced concealer gives a good quality coverage. It covers my eyebags, blemishes, and any discoloration I may have. It is lightweight, so it is like my skin but better. Since it gives great coverage, not much is needed to be used. I have two shades for this concealer: natural beige and light beige. With the natural beige I love using it as a foundation due to its coverage and with the light beige I use it for concealer. The concealer is buildable and does not leave me feeling or looking cakey. It blends nicely on my skin. Although I was able to find a match, I cannot say the same for everyone. It is difficult to find your correct shade because the concealer oxidizes and does not have the best shade range. I recommend you swatch shades and let them sit for a few minutes to find a better match.  The durability of the concealer is decent. It does not budge throughout the entire day. Prepping is key to long lasting makeup. The Too Faced concealer is water-based, so it is best to use a water-based primer and other makeup products that are compatible. Because I have combination skin, parts of my skin get oily while other parts might get a little dry. Even so, I have had almost no problem with this concealers ability to last the entire day. The only thing I have had a problem with is it creasing under my eyes. After using multiple different setting powders, it still finds a way to crease. I will continue to use this product because even though it does crease unde"

It lasts through anything! I've had many crying sessions while wearing this concealer and it stays PERFECT. I usually set it with a powder, which probably helps, but I don't think many concealers would be able to withstand that even when set with a powder! I also use a shade that matches my face to cover acne and it works wonderfully. This concealer blends out so nicely that sometimes I can just cover up problem areas with it, not apply any foundation, and go out looking great. Another plus is that the bottle is huge. I'm pretty sure this tube contains double what a typical concealer tube offers. One tube lasts me about a year.  This concealer is my ride-or-die and I have literally no interest in trying anything else!"
