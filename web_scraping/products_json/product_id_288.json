But I wanted a more \u201celevated\u201d chapstick and this one caught my eye. It feels buttery and creamy on the lips. It wasn\'t until half way through the tube that I realized this stuff actually works. My lips felt different- almost how they do when I get a botox lip flip. Finally I realize it\'s because my lips were plumped.  They don\'t look bigger but all of the little lip wrinkles were plumped up and filled in which makes them look smoother and younger. I will be repurchasing.   I wish I could take half star off for the price."

It is very moisturizing, stays on quite well, and leaves a bit of shine/luster on the edges of my lips that make them look plumper. It's the only lip product that I always keep with me and make sure I don't run out of. As some others have commented, there is definitely a lot of product in the tube once it seems to have run out, so I make sure not to toss it out right away."

A few days ago (early Jan), I noticed that my lips are plumper/slightly bigger and more pronounced, both top and bottom lips), like they have more collagen. I can only assume that Clinique's Repairwair Lip Treatment is responsible for this lip boost!  I consider that a side benefit, though, because this lip treatment has been excellent for keeping my lips hydrated, smooth, and lovely-feeling.....now they're lovelier looking too! Thanks, Clinique- definitely worth every penny and this is now my holy-grail lip treatment.  For those of you who say you don't see a difference in your lips, be patient- it took about 6-8 weeks before I consciously noticed the plumped effect. I still have a lot of product left in the tube. I am super-picky with lip balms and have tried many-- I highly recommend this as one of top lip products I've tried."

I can't really justify spending $27 for something that I go through so quickly. It sure SEEMS like it will be intensely hydrating when I apply it, but I don't feel any lasting moisture from it in between applications.

I've been using this for a month and am beyond surprised by the results of this product! In the beginning, I would use this at night but now I am using this 24/7 - it is that addictive! My lips are smooth, plump, hydrated, there is NO dry skin, and my lips have not cracked or ripped. What I like about this is that even when I'm not wearing it - my lips are still hydrated. I've found with other products once I've washed my face and lips that my lips are dry but not with this product. My lips are so soft and hydrated when they're bare.  I plan to use this up completely and repurchase again and again and again ... and I highly recommend this to anyone who is dealing with ripped and/or chapped lips."

When my lips are at their worst they are so sensitive, most balms, lipsticks, and glosses cause an allergic reaction. I had to return the All About Lips I bought with this because I was so allergic to it. This product is one of a few things that make my lips FEEL good.

I'm younger so I can't say much for the wrinkles and collagen aspect, but I've trusted Clinique on my skin, and it always comes through. Just a tip, something I've observed is that this is also a perfect primer for lipstick, so try it out, you won't be disappointed. Overall, one of my favorites from Clinique!"
