I decided this was the cheaper option and was excites to receive my kit. I used the kit regularly a few times a week for a month and didnu2019t see results from it. The worst thing is the extra products you receive with it is against your will and theyu2019re terrible. The face wash destroyed my skin and gave me a dry rash for weeks. The moisturizer is okay but burns so I donu2019t use it. I ended up doing reading on a home kit like this and it may work the first few times but the needles become dull over time and may not work or worse, damage your skin. Please save your money and donu2019t get this kit. If you can afford it, see a professional and decide if you even need micro-needling."

I did my research before purchasing, because I wasnu2019t about to splurge (even at the sale price of 180$) until I knew for sure this was for me. I have deep acne scars from cystic acne that Iu2019ve had since I was a teen. I have an autoimmune disease inside my body makes acne a big challenge overall. Iu2019m always looking for new ways to help with my scars, and believe me Iu2019ve tried everything until I found this tool. These photos are with just one use, and I sharpened the photo to make sure it enhanced the look of my texture so you can get a true idea of what it can do on deep scars. I cannot wait to see how amazing my skin is going to look in months from now. If you consider picking this tool up wait until it goes on sale, or you get it for sale through the Sephora annual sales."

At first, it's kind of scary to think you're putting needles on your skin but it's actually not bad.  The device is easy to use and surprisingly lightweight. It fits easily in your hand so you can just roll it across your skin without any issues. No pressure is needed - the needles do all the work on their own. If you turn it on, there's a light and some vibration. I can't say for sure that they definitely help at all but batteries are cheap enough that I don't see the harm in using those functions.  After using it, your skin gets a little flushed and some of the more bony parts (like the jaw line and around my forehead) can be a little painful because the skin is so thin, but let me tell you. The best part about this tool is that it absolutely enhances absorption of anything you put on after you use it. Seriously. Even if you don't have acne or fine lines, I have never seen anything help with product absorption like this thing.  I'm going to end up getting the other tip sizes for my lips and eyes.  10/10 do recommend."

For the first few times it was a little bit sensitive for my skin but later on itu2019s really pain free and the needles are so thin that you donu2019t feel it that much now. Slowly slowly I can see results because my skin is very sensitive and I have early signs of aging small wrinkles, my skin texture is uneven and sometimes I have breakouts. I would say this GloPro tool definitely helping with my uneven texture and I realized that I started having less breakouts. I really like that it has a sanitizer. And itu2019s very easy to use just two-three times per week you can even use on your neck and du00e9colletage, and on your body, so definitely looking forward  to buying more heads for the body and eyes.

I'm in my thirties, and my skincare routine has become more important to me over the past few years as I've noticed fine lines becoming a little deeper. I also have some acne scarring from my early twenties. My skin is sensitive, so finding the right products has been a challenge. I have read great reviews for microneedling, but have been hesitant to try it due to my sensitivity. No worries needed with the GloPRO. I have been using it for a month now- and even though I used it sparingly at first, I can see and feel a difference. Both my lines and my acne scarring seem smaller, and my skin just feels healthier and smoother than it has with other products I've tried (such as facial rollers, cleansing brushes, and exfoliants). I did get pretty red after the first few uses, but that seemed to get better with each use. I'm not sure if that's because my skin got used to it, or I just got better about applying the right kind of pressure. Overall, it's simple to use and it is much more convenient (and cheaper) than scheduling facials every few weeks. I would absolutely recommend this product."

It is easy to use, but you must make sure not to put extra pressure when rolling; just light as a feather application or you could get irritation.  Also, there needs to be more communication about what types of serums/moisturizers you should use after using the tool.  Certain serums really don't react well and others feel great. I'm still experimenting with what works best.  Also, you shouldn't work out afterwards because sweat will irritate your skin as well.

This tool is pretty awesome however. I was nervous at first I had never done any sort of needling to my face so I wasn't sure if it was going to be uncomfortable or hurt even. However it was completely fine! I mean you can definitely feel the tiny needles going to work but totally pain free. And while the instructions warn of flushing, I had minimal redness, only a bit in the cheeks. My forehead was probably the worst because there's less cushioning there. Using three times a week before bed, at first I didn't really see very much difference, however 4 weeks later I can definitely tell that my frown lines were less and less visible! And my as time wore on, as well I began to see a more prominent glow to my morning complexion. My skin looked more supple, firm and even in tone. And especially used concurrently with the serum and moisturizer! The morning routine is an absolute game changer to your results too! I have been really, truly impressed with this tool! I honeslty can't wait to buy the lip attachment to see how that goes. It is on the pricier end, but with continued use use, you will see results making it totally worth the cost!"

I feel like the results from this tool are as good or better than some professional microneedling and microderm procedures Iu2019ve had in the past. And for the price of one or two professional procedures, you get amazing results at home every other day. Iu2019ve already turned several friends on to GloPRO, and Iu2019ll definitely invest in the lip and eye attachment next."

I use this immediately after cleansing in the shower. I sterilize the head before and after using, and always use BeautyBio's Skin Prep Pads before I get to rolling!! At first, I was very intimidated to use this, but the instructions are so clear and the tool itself is so user friendly... I can usually be found in bed using this! I've also been enjoying the extra compliments I've been getting! It's usually What have you been doing differently? Are you going to a spa? You look great!

It was very presentable and also offered a nice way to neatly store all of the inclusions when itu2019s not in use. The needles on the tool are very gentle. They arenu2019t super long, which allows for a very comfortable microneedling session. They are virtually painless. I didnu2019t have any scars or unusual marks after using this. My face did sting a bit when applying serums and treatments immediately after using the tool, but that is also extremely understandable as the tool is meant to cause small openings for better product absorption. I used it for around 60 seconds-90 seconds around my face, concentrating a bit more on my unevenly textured problem areas. I ran the tool as instructed, first horizontally, then vertically, and then criss-cross while the tool is on with its infra-red light. I immediately applied my skincare products and went to sleep. The next morning, my skin appeared substantially plumper, and healthier. I had a better natural glow and my skin for sure absorbed all of the treatments. After a few more weeks of using this, my skin has noticeable positive results. The texture looks better and my skin looks plumper, fine lines are disappearing, and even my dark spots are lighter. It is a very travel friendly tool as it isnu2019t bulky. It is very easy to maintain, needing only a spritz of alcohol using the spray bottle that was included for cleaning (do not wipe the needles). Overall, it is amazing and a game changer in my books."

I should also mention that I have sensitive skin and am limited on what I can use due to this.  I am a bit of a skeptic so before using anything new, I always take pictures. I am very glad I did because after 30 days of use I didn't feel like there was much difference. BUT, I took more pictures at 30 days and am happy to say that there was in fact a difference. My 11 between my brows was reduced, my skin has a noticeable glow, my skin is smoother, and the few fine lines I have are less noticeable. It is easy to not see the changes in ourselves but pictures don't lie. I highly recommend that you take pictures also! I like that this product does not take long to add to my nightly skincare regime. While it is a little costly up front, if these results continue, it will be far less costly than any procedure. Plus it helps get the most out of my other skincare products. Overall, happy with the tool and excited to see the results a few more months down the road!"

I get slightly pink right after use, but fades by morning.  I'm not sure if this will work as well as professional treatments... Maybe with prolonged use it can, but it is much less invasive.  I plan to still get professional microneedling every year or two while continuing to use this at home.  Overall I have seen improvement with texture, fine lines, and basically an elimination of a scar I had from stitches on my cheek as a child.  One thing to note, if you use retinoids, do not use them after treatment, it stings.  I prefer to use hyaluronic acid and mucin after use.  The serums sink in so nicely.  I plan to purchase the body tip to improve the appearance of some loose skin on my stomach as well.  I had just one professional treatment on my stomach and did see a difference!"

The package was very nice and it did come with instructions. It would have been nice to have it direct you to a video tutorial bc Iu2019m a little more visual. I would have liked to see it turn off after 60 seconds instead of me consistently counting for its use. Using it was pretty easy but I canu2019t really say I saw a large improvement on my wrinkles. The following day of use, my face always seemed to appear more plump, but those results seemed to diminish the days that followed. Would I recommend it to a friend??? I guess I would tell my friend to try it for 30 daysu2026.but only if it wasnu2019t overly priced.  Had the instructions told me to use every other day, I would probably buy this productu2026bc then I wouldnu2019t see the results fade.

As I've started the the 30s my skincare has become a huge priority now in order to prevent an maintain my best youthful looking skin for years to come an this is one of those tools you need to help do that.

I love the BEAUTY BIO GLO PRO TOOL, it makes all of my products penetrate deeper into the skin and my skin looks noticeably brighter since using.  I also love THE BALANCE CLEANSER, it leaves my skin feeling squeaky clean without over drying.  It takes off all of my eye makeup as well, which is a nice bonus.  In the past I have used a toner, however I tried THE RESIDUE ERASER and love how the pad is pre moistened and you don't have to have a separate bottle, this is ideal for travel as well. Great finishing step to cleansing.  THE ZEN BUBBLE gel cream is surprisingly hydrating to the skin. I have dry skin, yet it left my skin feeling moisturized without feeling heavy.  Lastly, the mine spritzer bottle is a great addition, I can pour my alcohol in and have a spritz bottle for cleaning.  Love this set."

The face wash is the first one I have used that doesnu2019t make you feel tight afterwards and really gives your face a good clean.  The micro needling tool has been amazing as well to help with fine lines and wrinkles.  A must buy!"
