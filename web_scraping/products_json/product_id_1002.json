    "about": "Fragrance Family:Florals.Scent Type:Warm Florals.Key Notes:Strawberry, Jasmine, Vanilla.Fragrance Description:Endless Dreams begin with strawberries and raspberries so sweet you can almost taste them. It also contains notes of jasmine and peony act as a fragrant lace, apparent yet transparent, while Tahitian vanilla blends with the wild berries and lush flowers for a delicious and enveloping treat..About the Bottle:An oversized bow, perfectly imperfect. The LoveShackFancy perfume bottle references founder Rebecca Hessel Cohenu2019s lifelong love of bows and ribbons with a sculptural bow top that appears tied and tightened by hand. The Happy Thoughts print is a signature design chosen from over 2,000 in the LoveShackFancy print and lace library to decorate the pale purple berry colored bottle, a softly curved antique-inspired vessel carved with scalloping on top and a ring of rope on the bottom. Once finished, its spray top is removable so the bottle can be upcycled as a bud vase..About the Fragrance:A love that blooms in nature and is unafraid of big ideas, big crushes and a big life. Endless Dreams contains notes of addicting vanilla floral entwined with strawberry and raspberry and is inspired by a dream that doesnu2019t end, the sweetest of all. Thee scent was created with love and a fanciful, sweet touch by Gabriela Chelariu..Clean",

            "review_text": "This was a blind buy for me.  Seeing this box, I was just simply enamored. This shade of purple is literally my favorite color. The flowers are romantic and artistic. Gold, my second favorite color, framing the sides of the box and making the words shine beautifully.  The bottle is simply beautiful. Something you would want sitting on your shelf, decorating its own little space. Something you want to reach for and use. Honestly, it reminded me of a 1960s Avon bubble bath bottle. Or something similar. It's adorable.  The scents and notes promised, the simple fact of the perfume being named 'Endless Dreams' u2014 my goodness. I wanted this to be my signature scent so badly.  It absolutely breaks my heart that the product itself, the perfume, the precious liquid inside, smells so upsettingly horrid.  It's so artificially sweet and fresh, it gives me a headache, and I'm not the type of person that's sensitive to scents.   It's this sort of intense bathroom air freshener that just slapped you in the face with this awful scent when first installed it.  It's this rare side of the 1990s to 2010s were bad perfumes could be used as smelling salts to wake someone up.   It's this sort of 5 dollar body mist that you got because it only smelled kind of good when it was died down so much.   It's this awfully cheap and fragranced bath bomb that stained your skin and didn't clean you at all, and you had to take a shower afterwards anyways.   It's powdery sweet in the most upsetting and intense way."

On me, the fragrance faded much quicker than expected, requiring frequent reapplications throughout the day.

In my opinion, I think the notes it showcased on the perfume box and mention donu2019t smell like it. I quickly clicked yes on skeepers since it showed strawberries and vanilla, I didnu2019t get no aroma of strawberry when I sprayed it on my wrist. I waited a a couple of minutes because another perfume I didnu2019t care for at first but change over to the scent it mentioned. The endless dreams didnu2019t change over and only smelled jasmine the only time. I am picky with floral notes, but others jasmine scents I love, this one seems like the flower went old. I wanted to like the scent since the packaging is beautiful and the bottle of the full size is pretty, but now I know it a no for me and saving my money, since the bottle is on the pricey side."

When I first smelled this, I liked how you can definitely get the strawberry notes upon the opening, jasmine after & then the vanilla that rounds out the base. A nice soft sweet u201chint of fruityu201d, but mainly floral type of scent. Not a beast mode scent profile, but moderate. Think more elevated fragrance mist.   Iu2019d say if you have both of those scents above, you donu2019t necessarily need this. But if you love the aesthetic with the packaging, color, along with the fragrance itself & donu2019t have anything like this in your collection, perhaps give this one a tryu2026."

The packaging is equally charming, reflecting LoveShackFancy's signature romantic and whimsical aesthetic. Overall, Endless Dreams Eau de Parfum is a delightful addition to any fragrance collection, offering both convenience and a luxurious scent experience."

This is a truly lovely feminine scent that combines the warm sweetness of jasmine and tahitian vanilla with notes of strawberries and raspberries. If one is searching for a delicate yet flowery addition to an everyday fragrance, I would most definitely suggest this one."

Here are my thoughts:  Scent Profile: Endless Dreams features key notes of fresh strawberry, elegant jasmine, and warm vanilla. The strawberry adds a sweet and fruity opening, while the jasmine brings a delicate floral touch. The vanilla base provides a comforting and creamy finish, creating a beautifully balanced scent.  Overall Impressions: LoveShackFancy's Endless Dreams Eau de Parfum makes me feel incredibly pretty and girly. It's a delightful fragrance that exudes femininity and charm. The convenient 10mL travel size is perfect for on-the-go touch-ups, fitting easily into any purse or travel bag."

I adore the LoveShackFancy bottles with the cute bow and can't wait to get the large size!  I don't usually write reviews but I am tired of all of the 5-star Incentivized reviews for all the products out there.  I understand why companies do it but wish people would be more up front and honest with their reviews."

It's familiar and playful while at the same time being alluring, and the lingering aroma leaves me wanting to keep smelling myself. I strongly recommend this if you want something classic and warm with a fun, fruity twist!"
