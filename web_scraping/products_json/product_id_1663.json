Iu2019ve just been gliding this onto bare lids for the most beautiful, glittery holiday looks - Iu2019m debating if I can make this look work all year, Iu2019m that obsessed with it! I havenu2019t tried application with my finger yet, but it works beautifully with a brush. The sparkle is unlike any other eyeshadows I own - I feel like Iu2019m usually underwhelmed by shadows that look so beautiful in the pan but fall a little flat when you apply it. This eyeshadow delivers! When I run out, I would definitely pay full price for this."

It's not a particularly fine glitter, so I could also feel it on my eyelids. I did my usual cleanse and there was still glitter on my face.

Wild Dipper felt chunky flakey and there was somehow fallout when swatching. I don't know if it's because this shade has more of a pigment base but whatever the reason it's nowhere near as good as the formula of Space Cowboy. Plus the glitter was a little big compared to SC and didn't have the wet looking sparkle I was hoping for. I returned this.  Cosmic Craze was a joke. The base pigment was patchy and streaky and the glitters were gritty I could literally feel them when swatching. I didn't even bother putting this on the eyes and immediately returned it. Definitely not worth your money.  Rebel Star was the most decent out of the three. Again, in comparison to SC the glitter was not as refined but it's still pretty good but it's such a minute difference, if you haven't ever tried the moondust shadows you wouldn't notice a difference. It's similar in shade to SC but with more base pigment and practically identical sparkle.   Out of the three new shades, Rebel Star is the only one worth getting. That or the OG shades (Space Cowboy, Cosmic, etc.). I recommend the product just not the new shades."

Whether I'm going for a subtle shimmer or a bold, glittery statement, this eye shadow delivers on both fronts. The color payoff is impressive, and a little goes a long way, ensuring that the product lasts for a considerable amount of time. The texture of the eye shadow is smooth and velvety, making it easy to apply and blend. I appreciate that this product doesn't leave me with a trail of sparkles all over my face, but rather keeps them in place on my eyelids. If you're looking to add a touch of magic and sparkle to your makeup routine, I highly recommend giving this eye shadow a try!"

This really made me relax and made my day! I love this magical eyeshadow/topper.  It gives such a classy, sparkly look - with no glittery chunks, whatsoever.

THIS however, is gorgeous! It looks so wet on the eyelid, the brown is so warm and the glitter is embedded- doesnu2019t matter how hard or soft you swatch this, the glitter isnu2019t just a pretty topper on the eyeshadow, it is inside and all around.

I initially applied some on my bare eyelids with a brush, but felt the effect wasn't as noticeable. I applied some with my finger and felt I got much better results. The eyeshadow felt very creamy, soft, and luxurious. With my skin tone, I felt that Space Cowboy was translucent and only glitter showed up. I decided to overlay it on top of my normal, neutral everyday eyeshadow and it seemed to match well. However, it was still just a canvas of glitter/sparkles. It was long lasting and withstood a long day of wear, but taking it off was a bit of a pain. I kept finding sparkles all over my cheeks/eyelids. This would be perfect for special occasions or even casual wear when you want a splash of excitement. Even though it claims to have caffeine to give more energy to your eye, not sure it actually made a difference or was just a placebo effect for me. But I did feel like the sparkles made my eyes pop. I think this shade is perfect and matches all skin tones. I did notice that it doesn't show up as well in photos/videos. It's one of those products that looks better in person. I definitely enjoy recommend it."

I love using it on its own most days. It is almost subtle until you move your head around and the light catches the glitter. A little bit of this shadow, some mascara, and maybe a bit of liner, and you're ready to go. It also can be used to enhance other shadows. It adds a beautiful level of sparkle to anything else you top with it. The biggest drawback, and the reason I can't give this product 5 stars, is that the sparkle, the glitter, does fly everywhere. It is very fine, but you will still find yourself struggling to keep your undereye clean. If you think you can deal with that or it doesn't bother you, I thoroughly recommend it. Otherwise, stay away from it."

It is nice with small glitter to the powdered eye shadow. Because of its glow I would even dare to say you can use it as a highlighter as well as the back color is not an intense shade of pink. I really liked how just applying this shadow brightened my face and eyes. I will say that although I like it, the glitter did spread to other parts of my face such as cheekbone area. The powered shadow is not loose powder, but a compressed one which is great! The boxing is also nice, the shadow holder is just clear and the box is the nice urban decay purple color. Iu2019d recommend if you want something more neutral with sparkle. Sells for about $22 which is a little high for it spreading glitter."

It can be paired with pretty much every eyeshadow color, or worn by itself for a more subtle look. It is the perfect mix of sparkle and shimmer and can be as simple or as glam as you'd like. I personally like to apply with my finger as I feel I get the best color payoff that way, but you can also use a brush if you'd like. Apply it wet with a bit of setting spray and it increases the shimmer for an almost foil look. It is buttery and pigmented and all around fantastic! Check it out!"

If you're going more towards a slight glittery veil, definitely apply it dry, although applying it with your fingers definitely works a lot better than with a brush.

The only con I noticed was that there is a significant amount of glitter fallout. It's nothing horrible if you don't mind sparkles but it's definitely fallout. I noticed primer helped this some but didn't eliminate it.  Space cowboy also gives a celestial vibe so it's great for inspiration for looks but just as much as it's great for a neutral shade it's awesome as a accent shade as well.   Packaging is just gorgeous unique and beautiful.  I can't get enough of it.  I would absolutely buy it again and even gift it."

While applying glitter/shimmer eyeshadows, fallout is bound to happen but with this Moondust Eyeshadow it is very limited because the glitter is microfine. It is so easy to apply with a brush or finger. The formula is so smooth. Its great to put on by itself for a dewy shiny look or layering on top of other colors for a pop!

If you only do a single swipe, it gives off the prettiest sparkles, like a twinkling look. The sparkles are not overpowering, it looks like the sparkles have just the right amount and are spread out like you are looking at the sky. It's just so pretty. The formula is buttery and applies very smooth. It's beautiful wearing this alone or as a topper. The color of this is a very light brownish almost nude color, and the sparkles are a silver and champagne color, this is why I think it works with any skin tone. I LOVED this so much, it's a must for all makeup. SO versatile that you can wear this everyday or for full glam."

I have been wearing it just by itself a lot because it just gives off that perfect diamond shine and I've been getting tons of compliments. I also really like to just put it on over any other color eyeshadow that I'm wearing because it adds that brilliant pop of diamond dust or in this case I should say mundust. Ive been so impressed with this formula, that I've already ordered two more shades and they should be here in the next day. Totally worth the change and I'm just thrilled with it 100% The space cowboy shade is just beautiful, champagne and gold tones make my eyes pop so hard. I feel like a princess"

The glitter is very pretty as an eyeshadow and I also use it as a glittery highlighter. Some glitters feel rough on the skin but this product is smooth and easy to apply. The glitter is very sparkly and pretty."
