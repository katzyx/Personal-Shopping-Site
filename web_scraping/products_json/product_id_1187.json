The color payoff is bold and vibrant, which I love, especially for a pop of color on the cheeks. The formula is creamy and easy to blend, making it versatile for both lips and cheeks. However, it can feel a bit heavy if layered too much, and it tends to fade faster than Id prefer. Its a fun product for a fresh, bold look, but touch-ups are necessary throughout the day. Still, great for the price point and overall a solid 3.5 to 4 stars."

With my olive complexion, I often find it challenging to find a blush that looks natural, but this shade is perfect! It gives me a soft, healthy flush that enhances my skin tone without looking too pink or washed out.  The texture is smooth and creamy, making it super easy to blend, and it feels lightweight on my skin. I love that I can build it up for a bit more color or keep it sheer for a subtle glow. Its great for those rushed mornings when I want to look put together but dont have much time.  I also appreciate how multi-functional it is. I've used it on my cheeks, lips, and even as a light wash on my eyelids, which creates a cohesive, natural look. Plus, it lasts throughout the day without needing constant touch-ups.  Overall, Barely Nude is a fantastic choice if youre looking for a versatile, flattering shade that works beautifully with an olive complexion!"

This makes them ideal for those who prefer a fresh, no-makeup makeup look. Some versions, like the Nudies Matte, offer a more matte finish for those who prefer less shine.While Nudestix blushes are easy to apply and blend, their longevity is quite impressive. They generally stay put for several hours, though those with oily skin might find that they need to touch up during the day. The blushes tend to fade gracefully, maintaining a natural look even as they wear off."

The magnetism assists with makeup organization by allowing the same brand of blushes to stack together, encouraging saving space and keeping like products together.   I really liked the consistency of the blush. The creaminess of the blush made it super easy to grab from the pan and apply, no mess. The color I received was Picante Nude. For testing, I swatched on the back of my hand and of course by using it as I would my usual blush after applying my base. To give a visual of myself, Im the shade 315 in Fenty Pro Filtr. The back of the hand swatch test wasu2026. lackluster. The transition from my fingertip where I collected the blush to applying it to the back of my hand was a miss. The pigment seemed to barely show although I could clearly see that I had pigment left behind on my fingertip. When using it on my cheeks, I had to layer a few times to actually get it to show enough that I was okay with it.  Overall, this wouldnt be my first grab for blushes. However, I can say its also its not the worst and the fact that it can also be used on lips and eyes is a positive."

Thats said, I am loving the color and texture of this product! It reminds me of a powder, but with much more staying power.

The stack ability is also innovative in case you want to bring multiple shades without having them take up too much space. The formula itself, however, is nothing new or innovative. Its fine. Not too pigmented, blends well enough. Feels just a little bit flat on the skin and doesnt last all day, unfortunately. Its good, but I have so many that are better so I wouldnt default to this one."

The cream to powder finish really helps with the longevity in my opinion. On its own, the blush lasts me 6-7 hours. When I layer with powder blushes, I get more than 8 hours of wear. I also like the texture and finish for applying on my lips. The magnetic packaging makes it easy to use and store as it doesn't take up much space. I havent placed this blush in my on the go makeup bag. I feel as if it would make a mess in my makeup bag. I do like that there is a mirror.This is a clean formula so I feel like I have to use it more often so it doesnt go bad. I do enjoy the formula and like how it doesnt irritate my skin or cause me to break out. The blush applies beautifully with fingers, brush, or sponge. I do prefer to use a dry sponge to apply the blush. I find that using a dry sponge works best for my skin type. I would definitely recommend this blush, just be aware there is only 2.5g of product. Since this is a clean formula I find this to be a good amount as you can use the product up before it expires."

On the lips, the color starts off being subtle but it is very buildable so you can get the shade you want. On the skin, it glides on smooth and it is very easy to blend in. A small amount goes a long way. It has a natural glow to it and it is such a pretty color. I even used it as eye shadow and it looked very good. I got a lot of compliments when I used this product.

Why i cant give it a higher rating is due to the packaging and value of the product. The way you open it isnt convenient or intuitive and requires some learning due to the few magnets, wish it were smoother. Ive dented the product with the lid and lost some product.

Its texture is creamy but not too soft, its perfect to use with your finger to apply on your cheeks. The pigment matches the color and it blends very well. Its not as bright once applied as other blushes which I really like, because no one wants to  look like a clown after using blush."

I have been absolutely loving this blush and it lives up to all the rave reviews. The pink is a perfect spring/summer cool toned pink for my light complexion. The only reason I gave 4 stars, is because I found that it works differently depending on the type of foundation you use. With some, it went on seamlessly and gave a dewey finish, while for others it ended up being more patchy and powdery. Luckily for me, I found a routine that works perfectly so I personally love it and give it five stars, but had to mention that potential issue."

One of my favorite things about this product, Nudestix STAX ALL OVER COLOR BLUSH BALM, is that its not only a blush, but it can also be used on your eyes and lips! We love a multipurpose product! Plus its a magnetic multi-stacking makeup compact that can click together to create your own custom collection!  Now onto the product itself! The Stax dream cream has the most amazingly airy, cloud like cushion texture, and it blurs the skin, leaving you with a softly mattified finish! Its super longwearing, its also vegan and stacked with extracts and antioxidants!"

One of the standout features of this blush balm is its versatility. I love how easy it is to apply and blend on the cheeks, lips, and even eyes, making it a truly multitasking product. Whether I'm going for a subtle, natural look or building up the color for more intensity, the formula is incredibly buildable and forgiving. The magnetic stacking feature is a game-changer. Its not only convenient but also will be fun to mix and match different shades to create a custom color palette. Plus, knowing that the formula contains nourishing ingredients like green tea and rosehip oil, which help moisturize and diminish the signs of aging, makes me feel even better about using it regularly.  Another thing I appreciate is that the product is vegan, gluten-free, and cruelty-free, with eco-friendly packaging. It's refreshing to see a brand thats committed to creating clean, responsible beauty products. Overall, I absolutely love the color and versatility of the product. It's become a staple in my daily routine, and I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a multifunctional, skin-friendly blush."

To achieve the max pigmentation of this product I would recommend using your fingers. I tried it with a brush and it was not noticeable at all on my skin. If you are into soft-glam or natural/ no make-up look I would recommended this product. It comes off really easily and it did not clog my pores. The product has a shelf life of 6 months after opening so, if you do not wear make-up daily you would not get the max use of this blush."

The color I got is pink love and it is a beautiful soft pink color that is not overly bright or dark. I Iove how this product is so versatile and can be used as a blush, eyeshadow and lip product! It woks great as a blush and eyeshadow, but I am not a big fan of using it on the lips because I feel it goes on too powdery for the lips. It applies easily to the cheeks and eyes, and stays on for at least 8 hours for me. Only downside to this blush is that I feel there is very little product in the compact and will run out soon."

When I applied the product, it would wipe my foundation and concealer off. It also did not have much staying power. This would be cute for a not make up, make up look where you are not wear any foundation and you only need it to last 2 hours. Had potential but was not for me.

If I had any complaints it would be that its very light and takes a long time to build up to get really any coverage. I also found that a fluffy brush doesnt seem to pick up any pigment so I usually stick to a small powder puff."

It's the perfect in between product. Also the packaging is just bonus. The magnetic top, stacking capability and the mirror make this a perfect on-the-go blush.   Ok so for the color, Barely Nude. Yeah it is definitely barely nude. I had to build it up a bit to see it because of my tan, but this will be soooo gorgeous on a pale skin. It's like a blush and bronzer mixed together which I also love. I did try this on my lips and didn't like it. It was too powdery and looked weird. On the eyes, loved.   *I did receive this for free to review, but these are my own true thoughts."

The formula itself is light & airy; however, when applied to the skin, it provides a soft, blurring effect to the skin that leaves me cheeks looking & feeling years younger with warm, healthy vibe. I don't care what age you are...everybody wants that!! It's such an easy formula to utilize, because it literally applies & blends itself to perfection. I can't get enough of this formula and yes, it's left me wanting more shades. The packaging is uniquely fun & allows me to keep all my favorite shades together with the ingenious magnetic system! The Nudestix team didn't miss a beat with these Nudestix Stax All Over Blush Balms. The component even includes an adorable mirror for on the go application & touch ups! An optimal performing product that looks amazing and lots of fun....what's not to love?!!"

The color is Nice, but Im not totally certain what the use case is for this because you need many layers in order to really see much color because its not pigmented almost at all and when you are putting on that many layers of make up, it doesnt feel like it fits in a day to day makeup routine even though that is really how it is sold. The magnet aspect is actually fairly annoying because EVERYTHING also magnetic in your purse sticks to it. Sifting it from the Bobby pins is irksome. I would say there are much better options on the market though I really wanted to love this."

The shade Barely Nude is perfect for adding a subtle flush of color that enhances my complexion without looking too heavy or overdone.  One of the major benefits of this product is its versatility. It works beautifully as a blush, but Ive also used it on my lips and eyes for a cohesive, monochromatic look. The compact packaging makes it easy to carry around, so it's perfect for touch-ups throughout the day.  I would definitely buy this product again. The formula is hydrating and long-lasting, which is a big plus for my dry skin.

It compliments my brown eyes very well, I think darker pinky hues compliment brown eyes great. Its a 3 in 1 product, always love that.

The product looks very bright and has an interesting, play-doh like texture. I tried to use it with my fingers, which left fingerprint marks on the product. The product itself is buildable and light. If you're not very white, this could look a little ashy on you or might not even show up. If it shows up, it's a very nice, bright, lively, cool-toned pink and I like it. It isnt drying but isnt too oily as well, so i think all skin types can use this without any issues. Overall, I dont think it is for everyone, especially if you have a deeper skin tone, but if the color works for you, I would recommend it!"

I have a slightly olive undertone so shades with pretty much anything are notoriously difficult. This blush put a smile on my face when I applied it and looked in the mirror.

With intense pigmentation, a little bit goes a long way and the color lasts almost a whole day on my cheeks. More than that, magnetic compact packaging is easy to touch up even on the go.

Product: a pleasant cream when you touch it, chalky and patchy when actually applied. I am very fair and the barely nude barely shows up on my skin.

So yeah, that was obviously super cool. The blush itself is super soft and airy to the touch. I havent used it yet but it sat on my brush well and I put some on my wrist to test the pigmentation. Its not too powerful in pigment but more like a natural pigmentation.

Regarding the product itself, it's very creamy and soft. However, achieving strong pigmentation requires multiple swipes, which was a bit disappointing. On the positive side, once applied, the blush blends seamlessly into the skin, delivering a natural, subtle glow. The color is delicate and understated, providing a soft, natural finish.

I was initially skeptical that this product would work for me, as cream products usually don't last long on my oily skin, especially in the summer heat.

This routine has served me so well for the past 15 years that there have only been slight changes in it. From step-by-step, to amount of product, to product placement, to the products themselves, there is very little change in my routine. One of the few items I use is bronzer - with my face and skin, heavy makeup doesn't look good so my contouring (if you could call it that) is done with powdered bronzer that I apply lightly with a brush. Since I don't use much of this and I'm not TRULY contouring, I've been able to get away with cheaper, lower quality options. I used the Stax All Over Color Blush Balm in the color Sunkissed and OMG... I am never going back! I use it the same way I always have, with a brush, but it packs so much punch from pigment to blending to blurring! It is the BEST I've ever used and I love it so much that I'll be going back to get a Stax All Over Color Blush Balm in my blush color as well.   I'm telling you, I'm a convert and you will be too!

However, I do find the magnets a bit too strong for me to use when I've got foundation remnants and whatever on my hands, so that's the only downfall!

The formula does live up to the blurring claims -- on lighter skin, it can be built up to be noticeable and creates a blurred look on the cheek.

The barely nude colour is a beautiful, natural colour. I find the packaging quite innovative. It is maybe not the best to travel with, but is so easy to use, compact, and I love that it stacks on top of other blushes in this line."

One major issue I encountered was with the packaging; the magnetic lid came off easily when I accidentally dropped it, which made the overall feel of the product quite unreliable.  As for the texture, I found it quite disappointing. I tested it on both my lips and cheeks, and in both cases, I needed to apply a significant amount to get any noticeable color. On my lips, it not only took a lot of product to show up but also left them feeling dry and powdery. Similarly, on my cheeks, the texture wasnt ideal and didnt blend well, leaving a finish that felt uncomfortable.  While I understand that makeup products can be quite subjective and this might work for others, it just wasnt the right fit for me. Unfortunately, I dont have much positive to say about this product."

The ability to use it on multiple areas of the face makes it a great option for streamlined beauty routines. Id totally recommend the Stax All Over Color Blush Balm to my friends and family.

You can use only a little and it goes a long way. Its very blendable too, and I really like how it applied."

Its the perfect grab and go size I can just add to my purse! My only complaint with this blush is that it takes a while for the color pay to show up. Had to layer it multiple times for it to show up. Otherwise Love it! Lasts a decent amount during the day, would probably try it in different colors if they fixed the formula"

            "review_text": "Ill be forthright and admit that I loooove blush, so I was very excited for these nudestix blush stackers. The market for blush is so saturated, but these bring something unique to the table. I got the shade u201cBarely Nudeu201d, and for reference my skin is light neutral olive.  First, the packaging: I love the magnetic closureu2014its both sleek and very convenient and the magnet is strong enough that I can throw it in my bag for on the go. Usually my issue with blush pans is that they get gunky over time, and while it hasnt been long enough to completely rule out this issue, Id bet that this would be less of an issue because of the stiffer formula. While moves us on to:  Formula: the formula was completely unlike anything I expected. I thought it would be a melty, creamy balm, but its not melty at all. It almost feels like powdered blush in the pan, but it applies like a cream.  Application: I prefer applying it with a finger, because I feel like the little bit of heat from my fingers helps it blend in.   Shade: barely nude is a beautiful sun kissed flush, though its way more pigmented than I expected (in a good way!). I barely need a fingertips worth per cheek. Blushes run orange on me, and while this one has a touch more warmth than what I prefer, I think its very natural looking, like I got too much sun.  Value: I feel like the one drawback is that this blush is small with only 2.5 g of product. I totally get that if youre looking for a staple blush to wear everyday, this might not be the one, but I honestly prefer the small size because theres a better chance I can use it up before it expires. Plus I like the idea of stacking multiple of the and getting to decide between a few colors. Because Ive bought luxury blushes in the past, Im less inclined to reject it based on dollar value alone, but ymmv."

It gave me that summer blush and gave my face a different vibe. The blush lasts for hours, especially if you do a good prep and setting spray, but on its own will handle very well. I highly recommend it, I loved the packaging, the casing is magnetic so no more broken blush pallets made with cheap plastic. I highly recommend it for your beauty kit."

I love the way it lights up my face, and gives me some depth. The only caution I'd give on this product is to check how much product you get for what you pay for.

I appreciate the magnetic top that clasps shut. The blush has a creamy texture when I first dipped my finger in. However as I was blending it on my cheeks I did notice it have a more powdery feel/finish. I love that even though it's a cream blush it doesn't have an oily feel on my skin. It also sits very well on top of foundation and bare skin. I've tried both ways. The color works perfectly with my skin tone and looks so beautiful when it is blended. I went out for the entire day ( in 90 degree heat ) and my blush still looked just as beautiful as when I first applied it. And I'm not even exaggerating. I genuinely love this blush. My only criticism is that I wish there was more product in the pan. It seems like so little. It was my first time using it and my finger was already touching the bottom of the pan. So yea that needs to be addressed. Other than that..... Beautiful blush, loved it, and would most definitely recommend it to others."

The formula melts into your skin and produces the most natural sunkissed look I have ever seen in a blush. This formula is fun to use because it is a buildable product that has the ability to produce different shade intensities. When tapping on the product, it is almost plush-like and bouncy. The longevity of this product lasts around 6 hours before beginning to fade a bit, but for a natural day look it works just fine.   The one drawback I have with this product is the size of the pan and how little product you were truly getting. Because this is a buildable formula, you will end up using this product very quickly and I would have preferred it to be a bigger pan in this component, instead of having the large plastic edge.   I have attached a before and after photo to show the flawless natural sunkissed look I achieve!"

If you like a soft matte finish, this one is beautiful on the skin. It blends out beautifully and I like that  it dries down and I dont need to set with an additional powder. The shade sunkissed is perfect for my skin tone (medium olive) as a summer shade. I also like that its a multipurpose product and can be used on the eyes and lips for a monochromatic look. The stackable packaging is fun and I also like that there is a mirror included. All in all it is a beautiful product."

I was lucky enough (and so grateful) to be sent this to try out!  first and foremost, the pacakging came in tact and everything was safe inside. no damaged product nothing fell out, no broken mirror. so good design choice. it is magnetic so it slides and sticks in place.    the blush itself is unique to my collection and i think to the market. it's a soft bouncy powder consistency, but not melt-y like a mac bounce blush or a gelee dior glow blush , it's not a full cream consistency at all.    in my opinion, the best way to pick the product up is with your fingers or a dense dome-type brush. in regards to application process i do treat it like a cream product.  the color is buildable, i think many various skin tones would be able to use this particular shade because you can sheer it out or build it up to pack a punch! love to see more variation and inclusion in that regard as well."

The texture itself is lightweight, yet buildable which I really appreciate since I hate blushes that are very pigmented and require you to be careful during application. With this blush I can go in with a normal-to-heavy hand and not be too worried that I'll come off looking like a clown. Not powdery either so doesn't create much fallout. Also, love the luxury-feeling magnetic compact that you can continue to stack on - the overall packaging is 10/10 since it makes it very easy to carry around or travel with. Hopefully other brands take a cue from this and make blushes in smaller quantities with packaging that is compact for travel. Overall, highly recommend!"

            "review_text": "This is a stunning blush and great formula! It has a very soft and bouncy texture that dries down to a weightless powder finish. It applies so easily to the skin and blends out very well. I found that this formula works great on top of liquid/cream products as well as powder. The pigmentation is more on the sheer side but buildable and I found that it works great applied with a dense brush. I LOVE this particular shade of blush, it is a beautiful coral that doesn't pull too warm or pink. I could see this shade working great for a lot of skin tones! The magnetic, stackable component is really cool and great for travel! My only con is the amount of product you get, it contains only 2.5g/.09oz of product. Most cream blushes contain double that amount. Still, it is a beautiful blush formula and I would definitely repurchase myself when I run out!"

However, this color does not look good on my light skintone & even though the texture is cool it doesn't apply or blend well with a beauty blender or a brush brush. I even tried applying with my fingers and still didn't get great results so I'm unsure of how to apply it so that you can actually make it look right on your cheeks as it isn't buildable either! I wouldn't recommend this for those reasons I feel it's sadly a waste of money! I got this for free in exchange for my honest opinion."

It layers nicely over or under everything when I apply it with a brush. I think if I were to compare it to anything, it's kind of halfway between the merit and westman atelier blushes in terms of texture, sheerness, and blendability. The magnetic packaging is strong enough that I'm confident it wouldnt come apart if i chucked it in my makeup bag for on the go too! Overall I'm happy with this blush and the colors are really up my alley too! I'd consider getting the bronzer shade if they released it as a standalone, not just in the set. They should consider releasing more shades of the bronzer so everyone can wear it as well."

I love the magnetic feature. Overall, a good product if you want to buy quite a few shades as they can provide compactness when they stick together."

It's also pigmented , blends easily, never patchy, and buildable. I love the magnetic compact package. It's convenient to keep in my bag in case touch up needed. 100% recommend!!"
