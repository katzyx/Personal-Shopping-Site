A little goes a long way,it holds whatever fragrance I spray on top of it. My sensitive skin responds well to it"

I don't know if this jar was a returned item that someone previously used. I'm really upset as this is not a inexpensive product. I don't know if you can tell in the photo this brand has a lot more missing."
