I wouldn't really call it watery and it does have a fairly dewy effect on the skin. I have a medium/dark skin tone and tan easily. This does not leave a white cast at all. I took one star off as it really isn't very watery compared to others I'v tried like LaRoche Posay. Overall this is a good lightweight sunscreen that is still very moisturising."
