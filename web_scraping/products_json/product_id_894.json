I won't return it but I probably wouldn't get it again unless something changes about the packaging."

As a person with very pale lips, I need something that wont rub off or fade, and I was really disappointed in this. It does feel nice on application, however, has a great component (wand, lightweight texture, fragrance free, not sticky at all).  Perhaps the worst thing about this formula is how dry it makes your lips (the same tightness you feel from one of the old school liquid lipsticks). It makes me lick my lips constantly as if I used chapstick. Im in a lot of meetings during the day and want my makeup to be very low maintenance once on, but the experience has actually distracted me enough to want to write this review. Hope it helps someone!"

Initial application has a nice shine to it that isn't wet-glossy, which of course mattes down as it absorbs.  Pros: - With a couple of applications, I get a lovely lasting color!  - No scent (SO hard to find this), tastes slightly bitter if you get a glob of it but that's not unexpected - Glides on easily/nice texture for spreading - Even color coverage  Cons: - Extremely drying on my lips, doesn't act like an oil for me at all - Sometimes I get little black flecks spread on my lips along with the product.  It's not just dry skin and the product is brand new so it isn't old and dehydrated in the tube.  No fun looking in the mirror and seeing this mess unexpectedly.  I don't know what's happening in the tube for this to occur. - The stopper of the tube (that removes excess product from the wand) isn't secured to the main tube at all.  It slides up and down and product constantly leaks through the crack, getting all over the wand and threads.  I clean this thing off constantly, losing a ton of product in the process.  One morning the stopper popped out completely along with the wand and I had to jam it back in.  Not ok at this price point and NOT ok for a dark product that stains!  I love the color and staining effect but the cons are making me move on and explore other options.  I hope they revisit this formula and packaging to address the black flecks and leaking because it has a lot of promise!"

If you put it on and do not press your lips together- just let it dry it will leave a stain.  I can even apply certain glosses on top without it coming off any faster.  It applies smooth and wears away nicely.  It doesnt settle in lines or dry patches so its mature lip friendly.

Color: I was hoping for a rich brown but 1 layer on me was initially just a bit deeper than my natural lip color. It's actually very close to the color on the packaging, just more translucent. The longer it stayed on my lips the rosier and deeper the color seemed to be, which might be due to the staining. Texture: Thin but durable. It's not goopy but still feels like something substantial is on my lips. That said, I wouldn't rely on this to be the sole moisture for my lips.  Stain: After the gloss has worn down (took about 2.5 hours after some light snacking and sips of water) I do see some staining and it lasts a while. In person, compared to the photo, the stain color is deeper. More mahogany. Overall, I liked this product but would probably prefer it in a different (i.e. deeper) color. Tamarind is lovely but because on me it's so close to a nude, I'd rather have a similar color in a more substantial/nourishing texture. I think this color would be nice on fairer skintones if you're going for a modestly vampy look, and would be great for someone around my skintone looking for a rosy nude."

I checked the product amount in this which is only a measly 0.14 oz/barely 4 mL?! For reference, the new summer fridays lip balm mini sets each have 5 g of product in each MINI lip balm, and the tower 28 new mini sets also each have 5g. Each of those sets cost $25 and $20 respectively for a total of 20g, and the kulfi lip oil costs $24 for 4g. You do the math, this is a decent and nice product but an absolute robbery and the brand should be held accountable for giving such a ridiculously minuscule amount of product at this price."

Its a soft, lip bitten look that I wanted. Ill see if it lasts against oily foods I eat through out the day. So far it seems to be stubborn. Remember to exfoliate your lips otherwise the lip stain will become extra pigmented in areas of your skin that have the extra lip skin shedding thats still hanging there. Against my skin and lip color, the color appears as a slightly warm soft dusty rose shade. It looks more cool toned in my room with the lights off. Looks warm in daylight by the window. Pigment that intensified where I had the lip skin shedding became a little reddish. I recommend this lip stain to others. Very pretty! Im happy I dont have to reach for my lip liner and reapply over the course of the day."

It is called lip oil because it is moisturizing and easy to apply and blend, not because it leaves a shine like a traditional lip oil. I love that it is non-sticky and non-greasy.

The selfie was taken 1 hour post-application, the oil aspect had dissipated and the stain was barely there. Given the name (lip stain + oil), I figured it might be good to compare it to the Rare Beauty one. The swatch below has the Rare Beauty in shade Honesty vs the Kulfi in shade Carmel (both are one swipe). In terms of consistency, the RB is creamier and not as slippy as the Kulfi one. I'd also note that the RB lasts all day on me (and is cheaper for only a little less product). The Kulfi one also dried my lips a bit which never occurs with the RB. Neither last in terms of oil/shine, but at least the RB leaves a tint that doesn't budge."
