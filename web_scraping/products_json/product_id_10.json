I feel like itu2019s one of the few leave in conditioners that feels like itu2019s penetrating the hair and actually making it softer. I needed the extra hydration and moisture  since I recently bleached my hair, and not only that, but taking away the frizz and giving curls definition. Also the smell is unique and light, which I like a lot. So happy to get this product, considering I had just returned 2 leave in conditions I didnu2019t like before this."

I normally use a rinse-out color-enhancing conditioner, Pureology's Color Fanatic leave-in spray conditioner, a curl cream on wet hair and then break the scrunched cast with La'dor Wonder Hair Oil.  In the past I have used the regular Bumble & Bumble's 3-in-1 Curl Conditioner as a leave-in/styler and I liked that much better than this as it wasn't as heavy by volume.  What I mean by that is even with my hair being shorter right now I still have a lot of it because it is so thick (even with an undercut I have a ton of hair) so I need a certain amount of conditioner just to make sure all my hair gets some of it.    With this product it is really thick for a leave-in, and the texture is like my defining cream, but it is conditioner?  So I wasn't sure exactly what to do - I use a chickpea-sized amount of curl cream but it goes through my hair like butter because it has already been conditioned.  I needed much more of this because it IS the conditioner.  Still I didn't use nearly a full pump because of how afraid I was due to the heavy ingredients.  I didn't add anything else and just scrunched and air dried as I never use heat and I have crunchy straight bits higher up on my head where my curl pattern should start and the bottom half looks like beachy 2A waves as opposed to tight 2C waves.  I will try again following some other reviewers suggestions by using less product, adding water, and making an emulsion to thin it out first.  If that doesn't help, I will try it like a regular wash-out conditioner.  If that doesn't cut it then I might return it.  It's a decent product but definitely not intended for air-drying or to replace all the others you use like some sort of magic cream in a bottle.  I'm not going to make any recommendations against it as everyone has their own hair and routines."

I also like clean products.  So glad I tried this - it works so well when you put in damp hair and then blow dry. Makes my hair silky smooth and tangle free! You also only need a little bit - I use about barely a full pump, and my hair is almost to my belly button. I have had this bottle for months, but am about halfway thru the bottle. I wash my hair about 2-3 times a week. Bonus it smells amazing"

Itu2019s very difficult for me to get it thoroughly clean enough to be able to add any sort of leave in conditioner without it getting even more oily than it already is. I was very hesitant to try the blue tansy leave in so I started with a dime size and worked it on my ends- the scent is divine and it didnu2019t give my hair the grease ball look. It made my hair look and feel healthy. I recommend trying a small amount and then styling as necessary to see what works for you."

This is thicker than any other leave in conditioner I've used, not in a bad way. It almost feels like a styling paste to me, but not so thick that it doesnt come out of the pump. Anyways,  Since I started using this with their hair serum my hair has been so great! Barely any frizz or tangles. My hair feels very soft and healthy. My ends don't look as dry and split, I could actually air dry it now and not use heat on it and actually feel comfortable being seen in public. I love it!

This leave in was so nourishing and gave me the PERFECT amount of slip. I would use this in my routine when I want my coils to pop. And I would limit it to a handful of times a month. I also have the Baomint moisture leave in so I would use this interchangeably with that one (depending on the needs of my hair).

My hair feels instantly softer and hydrated. While my ends are usually quite dry and tangled, this leave in treatment is intense and works so well. It has a nice fragrance that disappears fairly quickly. This treatment really makes my hair look healthier, feel stronger, and gives it a nice shine.

I shower and apply this leave-in conditioner before work, and if I run my fingers through my hair at the end of the day, my hands are slimy with residue. BUT I started using half a pump and it's definitely made my hair shinier. I wouldn't say it's helped with keeping it silky smooth or soft, but it's definitely made my hair look more healthy.  If you're looking to help keep curls, this definitely helps. I usually keep my hair in a hair stick but by the end of the day I'll take it out and I end up with dramatic curls, most dramatic I've ever had.  Other thing I don't care for is it does build up on the scalp pretty fast. I usually shampoo every 3-4 days, but I find myself having to shampoo a little more often, which is drying me out."

I donu2019t have to apply much, Iu2019ll do a small pump, I rub it in between my palms and then I concentrate it on the ends and work up. My hair is so soft. No leave in has worked this well for me, not even Olaplex 6 or the Bumble and Bumble curl leave in. Highly recommend. What I really love too is how I can apply it on dry hair throughout the week (between washes) to keep it looking and feeling hydrated. And I feel like you get a lot of product for the price. 100/10 recommend. I will be trying more products from this company. The smell is medium-strong but I only really notice it on the day I applied it to my hair, and I like it just fine."

This stuff makes my hair super soft, the softest my hair has ever been I have tried the shampoo and it didnu2019t work well with my hair so I had to return it but otherwise If you are interested in purchasing anything from the Blue Tansy line I highly highly recommend this product  Super thick, the best way I find to use this product is straight out of the shower apply this product to your damp hair, then comb your hair and blow dry as normal Love love love will continue to repurchase this Bought with my own money too did not receive this!"

My hair definitely needs more than one pump of the serum.  Since the pump was broken and they refused to send me another pump, I purchased my own container with a working pump so, I could actually use the product. I really expected a lot more from this product line considering how much I like the baomint moisturizing curl defining gel. However, I was disappointed to say the least. I waited to give my feedback after I used the products awhile. However, my hair is lackluster and hard. Once I switched to different products and conditioner my hair is back to feeling soft and having a sheen/luster that does not feel weighed down. Save your money and please thoroughly do your research. Direct customer service with Adwoa was unpleasant to say the least."

It's short but fairly thick and quite wild without any product (super soft, but chaotic). I get a scary good Doc Brown vibe going if I just wash and conditioner.  I've tried Adwoa's Baomint mask and leave-in before this and loved them both, but I vastly prefer the Blue Tansy leave-in to the Baomint one. My hair loves protein and the bleaching means I need it even more. it's thick and creamy and gives a lot slip (my conditioner does too but this just doubles down on it). It smells heavenly and I don't have to use a lot of it for my hair to be covered.  I usually use this first after washing and conditioning (I use Olaplex 4P and 5) and layer other products over it. I feel like it performs best as a base product rather than over anything else. My hair is always very soft, shiny, and has lot of life when I use this and it isn't super heavy. It smooths and helps keep my curls clumped but doesn't weigh any of my hair down.  Adwoa's entire line of products are wonderful but I think the Blue Tansy line is going to be the standout."

I can actually use less since my hair is short.  I can finger comb my hair with ease and leave it alone.  I do not seal with an oil or use a cream and my hair stays moisturized for a week.  I do not know what type of sorcery Adwoa has been dealing in but these products have me shook.  If you have had problems with finding products that don't weigh your hair down or leave it dry and limpless give these a try.  I really think you will be impressed."
