I liked the light nude color and was like honestly, how bad could the smell be? BAD. The complaints were 100% right. It's horrific. Like rotten popcorn that's been baking out in the sun or something. I can't wrap my mind around how anyone thinks this smells good and will honestly probably just throw it away."

This leads me to say one tube will last soo long since itu2019s so long wearing.  I will say I definitely like this better than the Laneige lip sleeping mask. Itu2019s a thicker consistency, but not sticky. Buy it, you WILL NOT regret it. Iu2019m definitely buying in more colours once my current tube is empty. Xx"

I picked this up in best-selling 'Strawberry Sorbet' glimmer, plus the regular version in this flavor. Turns out the regular was more my thing: non-sticky, hydrating and I can definitely see a bit more volume after a week of using this. I'm not too big on the scent nor the flavor of this balm, but the color works really well for me. I'd say a step up from Laneige, though not quite as hydrating as Rhode's. It is thick, but surprisingly non-sticky. I have seen some reviews floating about which mention it being sticky, but that hasn't been the case for me. It's possible they may have been using a different flavor to mine. Would repurchase.   ~ My Top 5 Beauty must-have list ~  1. Hair Loss Treatment: u2018Divine Herbalu2019 - Hair Oil  2.

Hard to explain but Summer Friday lip balm kind of just sits on top of the lips. I feel like OH truly helps lips and SF leaves me needing more. So impressed that I immediately returned all the SF ones I bought so I could purchase all the OH ones instead. I love the Original Citrus (non glimmer) for everyday and care at night. I also love the limited edition collaboration I Heart Me (Strawberry Sorbet Glimmer) and its beautiful pink/bronze shade - naturally enhancing for a touch of color. I also love the Lingonberry Jam Glimmer for another colored one - its purple/berry shade is beautifully enhancing and bright/pretty. Other ones I tried at the store but didn't buy -- personally, the Strawberry Sorbet (non glimmer) is an artificial Strawberry fragrance but the shade of pink is gorgeous. The Creme Brulee (non glimmer) smelled sickly sweet, but again the brown nude is beautiful. Hard to get over the scent so likely won't buy these ones. Overall - sooo happy w the formula bc I am super sensitive and get allergic reactions to most lip products and balms."

            "review_text": "Like many people I have tried MANY lip balms over the years. Whenever I go to the store I tend to pick up a new one. I knew nothing of the hype when I bought this and after I had tried it-only my sister had recommended this to me. I was out and about with my sister and told her I forgot my lip balm and my lips were so dry. She let me try hers, and I thought it was really good. My first impression was: itu2019s thick, will probably sit on the lips and not actually hydrate into the deeper layers of the lips, and my lips will probably just get dry again at some point during the day.  My lips did not get dry. Instead, it moisturized my lips so much that the dead skin on them just kinda sloughed off. Iu2019ve only had a few lip balms in my life do that. This one was different-the thick formula allowed it to stay. Yes it does settle on the lips long after you put it on, but some of it does get absorbed. Because of this, it doesnu2019t feel like itu2019s just sitting there and masking the dead skin if that makes sense.   Itu2019s not sticky. I know some people claim it is, but to to me it does not qualify as a sticky lip balms. Itu2019s more like when you put a hand cream on and touch your palms together just after applying. Itu2019s the touch of moisturized skin, not tackiness. Iu2019ve had sticky lip balms and this is NOT the definition of it.   My lips have changed after using this. Theyu2019re less dry, they stay moisturized longer throughout the day. It has good staying power without having to constantly reapply. For once, they feel truly moisturized from within. Iu2019ve had two other lip balms do this, but one was too expensive, one sat on the lips and didnu2019t penetrate the skin, and (wait there was a third) another one didnu2019t taste good and would disappear after a few hours. This one is by far the best.  The cocoa one has a nice light cocoa scent and barely any taste. I just went back to buy the creme bru00fblee color. I will most likely get more. If youu2019re on the fence, just try it out."

Both provide great hydrating effects, so I'm sold now on using peptide lip treatments, at least during the winter."
