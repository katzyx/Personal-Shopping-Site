I was terribly wrong because this burns and itu2019s so sticky ! My face feels hot every time i use it and I donu2019t have a problem with Aloe or Coconut. This is a terrible reduction , it leaves a glue like residue like you used hairspray. Stay away"

Itu2019s a great product! I l bought it specifically to use with a hyaluronic acid serum that I have. Hyaluronic acid needs moisture to work effectively, so I spritz this mist both under and over the serum. My skin feels soft and moisturized despite the dry winter weather Iu2019m experiencing.  My only caveat is that the packaging is not that great. Instead of a fine mist, like other facial mist brands I have tried, this one is more of a wet spray. Itu2019s hard to apply evenly apply and easy to get too much in one spot. I read in the description somewhere that it says it could be used as a makeup setting spray - unlikely due to how big the droplets are. I suppose itu2019s possible I got a faulty bottle, as it also did leak in shipping. (Sephora addressed this already so itu2019s all good.) I think Iu2019m going to try using the spray pump from a different empty bottle I have because thatu2019s the only issue keeping this from being a 5 start rating for me."
