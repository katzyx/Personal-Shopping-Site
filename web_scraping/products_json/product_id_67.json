This technology was initially developed for burn victims so they would not have to go through skin grafts.  Itu2019s made up of 40 ingredients, a patented cocktail of goodness for the skin. 30 ml runs approximately $185.  The recommended usage is two pumps twice a day every day, meaning the product should last you around 4 weeks. Augustinus Bader said that in order to get the full benefits from this product, it needs to be the first thing and only skincare that touches your skin, a one product wonder. And you must give it at least 30 days to start seeing the benefits. I think to really see visible benefits, I would need to give this a good 3 - 6 month try.  However itu2019s a bit out of my price range which is why I only give it 4 stars. I was afraid to start using it after reading several negative reviews.  However my skin loved it u2026 unfortunately.  It has a rich, emollient feel, great for my mature skin. It is fragrance-free, free of gluten, GMOs, parabens, sulfates (SLS & SLES), silicones, DEA, heavy metals, talc, and petrolatum/paraffin/mineral oil. and 100% vegan."

Also, even though it doesnu2019t look like it, there is so little product for the price! I had to do a double take before I packed this in my carry on bag for travel. My bottle was 1fl oz and listed at $185! A very costly cream and I was using 3 pumps for each application. Works great if you can afford it."

The Rich Cream is luxurious, creamy and thick, but it doesnu2019t feel heavy or overly thick. It soaks in quickly and leaves my face without any grease or shine. It doesnu2019t have a strong scent. The only issue I have is that I would like the pump to give a little more product because it does soak in so quickly."

At first it feels like a thick glaze when you put it on your skin, however after a couple minutes it fully absorbs u2014 leaving a healthy + subtly dewy finish (it does not look greasy at all u2014 it looks like healthy/hydrated skin).   Outside of that, the packaging is objectively gorgeous u2014 just absolutely stunning.   Regarding the efficacy, I have only been using this product for around 4-5 weeks, so I cannot speak to the long term effects u2014 however my skin in general does look beautiful + healthy immediately after application. Iu2019m excited to see how my skin transforms with continued use.  Lastly, I have normal-to-dry + sensitive/reactive skin, and have not found this product to be irritating at all u2014 if anything it actually has helped ease preexisting irritation.   All in all this is an excellent product, and Iu2019m excited to continue using it."

It does not ever feel greasy, wears beautifully with or without makeup.   There is a light scent but barely noticeable. I havenu2019t noticed any irritation from using this moisturizer, despite being prone to irritation. My skin is combination dry/oily. I use an essence and a serum underneath.   The bottle is a high quality heavy glass component. The cap feels like plastic which seems a little lower quality than the rest of the materials, but not a big deal.  I received the product for free from Influenster in exchange for a review, and in all transparency I would probably not pay full price for it since I have so many other great moisturizers that cost much much less, but Iu2019ll definitely be using this in my regular rotation until it runs out."

This cream is incredibly moisturizing, with a rich and luxurious texture that feels amazing on the skin. One of the things I appreciate most is that itu2019s fragrance-free, so itu2019s gentle and non-irritating, especially for sensitive skin types. I typically use it as the last step after applying retinol, and it works wonders by locking in moisture and preventing dryness. It leaves my skin feeling plump, hydrated, and nourished. Highly recommend for anyone needing intense hydration without unnecessary fragrance!"
