It's comparable to Violette_FR shade Louisa. It applies so smoothly and gives such a natural flush. The best no makeup-makeup shade. For reference I'm light-medium with neutral undertones.   This is a safe blind buy imo. Completely worth the $30 if you can swing it but I guess if you're reading reviews you must be able to lol."

Merit formula is beautiful, the color is vibrant, but it blends to perfection, leaving you with a sun kissed look but the cool toned version. It's a mix of red and berry. I love it, would 100% recommend. My skin is combination to oily, and it lasts really well on me w/o powder. I also have the merit and t28 blushes, it's less glowy than the merit more similar to the t28 in texture, but this one blends a little better, and you can build it up more."

It's great for anyone looking for a blush that wears well with minimal makeup. I've even worn it over just a tinted SPF, and it looked fantastic.

I like to be cheeky with my blush! I really had to apply quite a bit of the product to get the shade I desired, but it is marketed as a baby pink and is designed to give you that glow from within look.

The formula is soft and buttery, it blends out like a dream, is the perfect cool-toned pink, and LASTS! Like this color lasts a full day on me even in the summer.

The incredibly pigmented products are not for me unless I were doing stage makeup, I suppose. So I asked the staff for some recc's saying I'd rather have to build up blush than try and calm it down and they recommended this and the Ilia.   This is PERFECT. Easy to apply, easy to blend and move if needed and builds up in layers if you want more punch. Cheeky is almost exactly the color I flush and is exactly what I wanted.   I'm not a full coverage foundation person, so I can't speak to the reviews saying it doesn't work with it. I wear either the iris and Romeo best skin days or Pat McGrath foundation and this works well with both."

I also have pretty sensitive skin when it comes to makeup. I have tried multiple cream based blushes to avoid making my skin drier and avoiding the powder blush palettes breaking during my travel. I ended up with my skin getting irritated by excessively blending out the product because it was super pigmented and became patchy by the end of my day. I tried many methods of applying, but they didn't work and I gave up on blush. Until someone recommended this one to me. The color (cheeky) was perfect for exact vibe I was going for, blended out so smoothly, buildable, wasn't drying to my skin, and not sticky. It started off super light when I applied, almost giving like a natural redness moment, and as I applied more it became more present. I found this convenient because most cream blushes start off super pigmented even after you use a little bit. That's fine, but if you're like me and don't have time to be blending and your skin is easily irritated, then that won't do. I also haven't noticed any acne come up from using this product, so let's hope that's not temporary. 5/5 !"

However, even with primer, powder, and setting spray, as others have said, it doesn't have a lot of staying power. I've found that over applying it before putting powder on does help. It still looks subtle enough under the powder and seems to last a bit longer. I don't generally need my makeup to last all that long, so I like it. But I know people that really need their makeup to stay in place during a busy, active day probably would not.   Also on a side note, I really don't like the packaging. It feels extremely lightweight, flimsy, and cheap. Make sure you screw the top on tightly, too. Mine has fallen off in my makeup bag once already. It hasn't yet since I've been careful to tighten as much as possible before putting it back, though.   So overall it's okay and I got it during the sale and will keep and use it. I probably won't be repurchasing though."

It's nice when it's new and rounded for some relatively precise application, but as you use it, you're left with a big bulky application area. The worst part is the wastefulness. There is almost half a container of product below the lip of the container that you can't access! They desperately need to have packaging that pushes up that product. There's no easy way to dig out that remaining product without defeating the purpose of the swipe on blush. For a brand that pushes clean, it's very wasteful packaging and I will be moving on to another brand after this one is gone."

Lori Harvey uses this, so i bought it, it's a beautiful blush, just doesn't have a lot of staying power. i recommend this (and other Merit products) if it's a one time purchase, but BHT products shouldn't be used long term, a small dose of BHT is the better way to go. i live for this compact blush idea, but formula must change:)"

The only thing I've noticed though is it fails to last on my face :( I put it on in the mornings before school and about 4 hours later it is gone. That being said, I do put powder products on top in hopes of it lasting, but it doesn't. I say for the price the lasting power should be greater, so I am going to find a new product instead."

I feel like the only way to wear this is WITHOUT makeup. Not to mention $30 for this little of product and cheap plastic packaging; purely marketing price pointed."
