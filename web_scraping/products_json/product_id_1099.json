It's comparable to Violette_FR shade Louisa. It applies so smoothly and gives such a natural flush. The best no makeup-makeup shade. For reference I'm light-medium with neutral undertones.   This is a safe blind buy imo. Completely worth the $30 if you can swing it but I guess if you're reading reviews you must be able to lol."

Merit formula is beautiful, the color is vibrant, but it blends to perfection, leaving you with a sun kissed look but the cool toned version. It's a mix of red and berry. I love it, would 100% recommend. My skin is combination to oily, and it lasts really well on me w/o powder. I also have the merit and t28 blushes, it's less glowy than the merit more similar to the t28 in texture, but this one blends a little better, and you can build it up more."

I like to be cheeky with my blush!

I'm worried because the girl at the register was like OOOhhh! What colour did you get? turned it over and said Persimmon. then absolute dead air. I assumed then this must be a heavily returned product. It doesn't seem to stay on as long as Rouge, and its quite balmy. Balm to pigment ratio is extreme. Will hold onto it for a few days before returning it and going with a different brand."

The incredibly pigmented products are not for me unless I were doing stage makeup, I suppose. So I asked the staff for some reccu2019s saying Iu2019d rather have to build up blush than try and calm it down and they recommended this and the Ilia.   This is PERFECT. Easy to apply, easy to blend and move if needed and builds up in layers if you want more punch. Cheeky is almost exactly the color I flush and is exactly what I wanted.   Iu2019m not a full coverage foundation person, so I canu2019t speak to the reviews saying it doesnu2019t work with it. I wear either the iris and Romeo best skin days or Pat McGrath foundation and this works well with both."

I also have pretty sensitive skin when it comes to makeup. I have tried multiple cream based blushes to avoid making my skin drier and avoiding the powder blush palettes breaking during my travel. I ended up with my skin getting irritated by excessively blending out the product because it was super pigmented and became patchy by the end of my day. I tried many methods of applying, but they didnu2019t work and I gave up on blush. Until someone recommended this one to me. The color (cheeky) was perfect for exact vibe I was going for, blended out so smoothly, buildable, wasnu2019t drying to my skin, and not sticky. It started off super light when I applied, almost giving like a natural redness moment, and as I applied more it became more present. I found this convenient because most cream blushes start off super pigmented even after you use a little bit. Thatu2019s fine, but if youu2019re like me and donu2019t have time to be blending and your skin is easily irritated, then that wonu2019t do. I also havenu2019t noticed any acne come up from using this product, so letu2019s hope thatu2019s not temporary. 5/5 !"

It still looks subtle enough under the powder and seems to last a bit longer. I donu2019t generally need my makeup to last all that long, so I like it. But I know people that really need their makeup to stay in place during a busy, active day probably would not.   Also on a side note, I really donu2019t like the packaging. It feels extremely lightweight, flimsy, and cheap. Make sure you screw the top on tightly, too. Mine has fallen off in my makeup bag once already.

It's nice when it's new and rounded for some relatively precise application, but as you use it, you're left with a big bulky application area. The worst part is the wastefulness. There is almost half a container of product below the lip of the container that you can't access! They desperately need to have packaging that pushes up that product. There's no easy way to dig out that remaining product without defeating the purpose of the swipe on blush. For a brand that pushes clean, it's very wasteful packaging and I will be moving on to another brand after this one is gone."

Lori Harvey uses this, so i bought it, itu2019s a beautiful blush, just doesnu2019t have a lot of staying power. i recommend this (and other Merit products) if itu2019s a one time purchase, but BHT products shouldnu2019t be used long term, a small dose of BHT is the better way to go. i live for this compact blush idea, but formula must change:)"
