Imagine my disappointment AGAIN that the full size barely had any product it in it as well! I will say the color is pretty and I have full lips so it looked amazing on me. I probably wonu2019t buy again only because for the price and the amount of product you get is not worth it."

It doesnt give a super glossy look and almost dries down to adhere to the lip without getting sticky. Wears very nice throughout the day as well, every once and a while you can smack your lips and still feel a generous amount of it on and it stays silky and smooth. Almost like it clings to your lips. When applying it does feel thick however, which I got used to very quick but was hard to enjoy. I bought the cherry vanilla, and it has a very subtle scent, which was great because you dont smell it all day. Almost like a cherry bubblegum. After a few moments when you apply you can feel a slight cooling sensation on your lips that doesn't burn. It also has a different type of applicator which I thought I would love but it grabs way too much product for myself personally, and then everything gets messy when I try and put some back. The bottle didn't spill when I let it bounce around in my purse which is a plus but it also came half full due to the shape of the bottle and applicator (with the wand in the bottle it looks full, but when you remove it there is very little product in the bottle). I've also used this when my lips were cracked and it hasn't bothered my skin at all, but I wouldn't call it 'nourishing'. 0 colour payoff. All in all, it's a very basic and boring gloss and I'm not sure it's worth $34 but I also didn't hate it. If it was cheaper I think it would be a lot more worth it for what it is and does."
