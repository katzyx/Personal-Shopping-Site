Yes, birth control pills help, but I don't want to be on them for decades. Recently, I was feeling down about all the small, dark red marks that were left around my chin and under the jawline from previous breakouts. I would spend 15 min every day trying to cover them up with concealer before I leave the house. Then I came across this  wonderful product. It's a milky, liquidy gel that you're supposed to put on the dark spots you want to fade. Then you can apply moisturizer/serum/primer/makeup etc. I wait 10 to 15 min for the gel to fully dry before I apply my moisturizer and makeup. The product does feel a tad sticky and may pill if you apply too much under your makeup so use sparingly. I have been using this religiously day and night for 3 weeks. The dark spots that I have from previous breakouts have significantly decreased. To me, this product is non-comedogenic, non-acnegenic, and does not make my skin feel dry or irritated. I love it so much and will repurchase. Sure, it's a bit pricey, but since you only need a pea-sized amount or so to dab onto problem areas, the bottle should last you a long time. I definitely recommend!"

Once it finally cleared up, I was left with scarring which is still existent 4 years later. For years Iu2019ve been motivated and persistent to find a solution. Iu2019ve tried microneedle, peels, and about every brightening product there is.    Then I found BLUME. Every one of their products is relevant for girlies with acne/ scarring, but the serum is IMMACULATE. it feels nice, has trustworthy Ingredients, and most importantly it works. My skin feels smoother, looks brighter, and scarring is reduced. WOW. feeling more confident than ever- and Iu2019m out here sending no makeup selfies to all of my friends LOL.   10/10. Will be repurchasing."

Product is really gentle. Love the packaging, the pump is super easy to use. This serum has a sort of thick gel texture, no fragrance at all that I can tell. The instructions said to use two pumps, but that wasnu2019t enough for me so I used three. I use it every morning after my cleanser and before my moisturizer.   After the first week, I didnu2019t notice too much of a difference in the appearance of my scars but, to be fair, I have a LOT of them from experiencing major mascne for the past two years. Still, I saw a huge improvement in the texture of my skin. Noticeably smoother.   After the second week, I saw an definite improvement in the newer scars I had. I could see that new blemishes I had werenu2019t leaving any new scarring which was awesome.   After this third week, my scars have faded beautifully overall. None of the redness I was experiencing all the time and the strength and texture of my skin is so much better. A lot of my bigger scars are still there, but I think with consistent use in combination with the right exfoliants, Iu2019ll finally be able to get rid of them."
