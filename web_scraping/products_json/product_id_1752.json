But the packaging bugs me. Itu2019s unnecessary. Itu2019s heavy, slippery, and difficult to open. Also the compact is so small you canu2019t fit even a mini puff inside it, so not great for portability. I feel like Westman could put this powder in a much lighter compact with a bit more product, and knock the price down ($105 CAD is ludicrous - I bought bought  this with a rouge reward). The jacked up price is the reason for the 4 out of 5 stars."

I use this one under the eyes over the tower 21 concealer and its holds perfectly but illuminates without any shine. ( you dont want shine when you have just ok skin texture and wrinkles) I work long shifts so thats awesome. The only bad thing is the price.. but   Th powder itself is PERFECT."

If it is meant to be used at home and not on the go, then my RMS loose un-powder performs not worse and frankly better for a quarter of the price of WA powder (if you calculate the cost per gram of these powders). Now to the skincare claim of this powder... well, how do I measure it? Is it 5g of skincare for 98$ in this compact? That is one very expensive skincare... My cheap in comparison Augustinus Bader and La Mer deliver better results. Overall, 2 stars for nice to look at case and that it does not crease under eyes."

I'd recommend using this primarily to set concealer and also to press it into the skin for a more natural finish. Overall, a good choice for a setting powder that can travel well."

The compact has a nice weight to it though, and is small enough to take on the go for quick touch ups. I also like that this compact is refillable. The powder didnu2019t leave a white cast which is great. I also love how the finely milled powder gives my skin a softly blurred and subtle matte finish, and it feels like silk.

It has helped the texture of my skin while doing this and keeping my makeup in place.  I also love that it gives my skin some much needed blue light protection. I highly suggest you give this powder a try it is well worth it!"

Itu2019s like a whisper over your skin that instantly blurs and mattifies without creating any cakiness or causing any creasing or that dry, tight feeling to the skin. The compact itself is HEAVY! It feels like solid gold lol Its also incredibly stunning and modern and just beautifully made.

This Vital Pressed Skincare Blurring Talc-Free Setting Powder is an expensive ($75!) but amazing addition to Westman Atelieru2019s line of clean makeup. It comes in six shades - I tried the Creme. I love how the lightweight finely milled powder gives my skin a softly blurred subtle matte finish. Kt doesnu2019t cake up or feel dry, leaving my face smooth to the touch. I set my face with the powder before I leave the house and touch up a few times while I am out to help control my u201cIu2019ve been running aroundu201d shine in my T-zone.  The packaging is luxurious, the refillable powder comes in a weighted compact with a little pouch. The pouch will prevent any powdery messes in your makeup bag or purse!   Cons: Refillable but refill pans not available yet Does not come with a brush so you will need to have one on you Not for those who seeking a caked on matte finish look  I will absolutely buy when I run out, even in the Translucent shade.  At $75 yes this is high end makeup but a little powder will go a long ways and you wonu2019t lose any powder to your makeup bag because of the sturdy compact.  Great product!"

It is a very light powder that pairs perfectly with my foundation and seems to set it almost like a setting spray does, even in the Arkansas summer heat my foundation stays and looks great all day long thanks to this new product. It also helps minimize my large pores. The powder has a glowing brightening affect that is absolutely stunning and would be a great addition to almost any skin tone. Along with all of that the packaging is absolutely stunning and definitely looks great in your purse for on the go touch ups. My only complaint would be the fact that there is no brush included with the compact. Even though this is a little pricer than I would normally pay for a powder I will definitely be purchasing another when I run out. I also love that this is a clean cruelty free product. I think a loose powder in this shade would be a great product addition to this line."

I will be honest, if you have the money to spend and like luxe things, this is a solid powder. But this powder is small, really small. It is the size of a Clinique Cheek pop blush for reference.

I did try this out over the Skin Foundation Stick and the shade of the foundation was a touch too light for me.

The foundation stick has become a staple for me. As someone with dark marks on my face, I find the foundation to be great coverage that seamlessly covers all my dark marks. Its also buildable too for days I want to apply heavier makeup. Because the foundation stick is creamy, I found it best apply a matte primer before using, to prevent it from becoming oily throughout the day. It also transfers easily, however a setting spray will fix that.   The translucent pressed powder is the perfect complimentary powder for the foundation stick. I find that using the pressed powder helps to set the foundation in place. A few more dabs throughout the day also helps prevent creasing of the foundation. As a person of color, I was pleasantly surprised to find that the translucent pressed powder blendly seamlessly with my skin complexion. It did not have me looking white.  Overall I am happy with these products as they are great for making me look like I have flawless skin. Ladies, if you're looking for a lightweight foundation and setting powder to hide hyperpigmentation, these are the products for you."

I wore this pressed powder for date night and was satisfied with the finished look it gave after putting on my makeup. Now I have to admit that I dont wear makeup every single day. Iu2019m still learning, and the more I learned the more I wanna wear.

The mirror is also a huge plus for travel. Love it! I received the translucent powder complimentary to test. It's summer time and I use it as a setting powder currently. It has a silky feel, which is great! If I get shiny I also use it to blot and have no breakout issues. While the package is small, it will likely last longer than it appears to. The powder doesn't set my face for as long as I'd hoped, so the price point is a bit high for the performance. Overall, however, a decent (and gorgeously packaged) powder. Love that it's talc-free."
