It's no longer clean at Sephora, it no longer has SPF and I see no similarities between what it is now and what it used to be. Now it literally feels like I'm spreading acrylic paint all over my face. It oxidizes within the hour, streaks and doesn't dry. Tarte ruined a once amazing product and they've lost me as a customer. I also find it hugely unethical that older, positive reviews left for the original formula are still up and listed under the new re-formulated (and crappy) product. Not cool."

Not to mention how long the bottle would last me. About 1.5 years ago I replenished with another bottle and just 12 months ago began spotting weird white heads/red areas around my mouth. This has continued for the past year spreading over my face in various different locations. After a chat with my dermatologist it turned out to be a type of stubborn contact dermatitis. I tried replacing face washes, bronzers, mosturizers, laundry detergent and even went on antibiotics to try and solve the issue. I never thought to try a new foundation because I had been using this forever and was loyal to it. After researching, it appeared that Tarte decided to start adding unneccessary fragrance to this product and I am devastated I can no longer use it. Luckily, my skin has cleared up since I stopped using it and I HIGHLY discourage anyone with sensitive skin to try this!!! I have attached photos below that spread over an 8 month span and just show you an example of what this did to my face. There are much better options out there for sensitive skin. It's not worth the risk."

Nice undertone options to choose from for medium-depth range but canu2019t speak for the lighter or deeper ends of the range.

On a whim, I stopped by my local Sephora, and spent some time trying to color match. I narrowed it down to this brand and this shade, specifically for the clay aspect and the total coverage offered. And by the grace of my Irish Appalachia born ancestors, it WORKED. The shade covered the red entirely, without looking caked and looked surprisingly natural. I didn't even need that much, to achieve the coverage necessary for my temperamental skin. It lasted well past my work shift, and didn't break me out. It's definitely not for everyone, since the coverage offered is pretty intense. I'd only really recommend this for anyone that needs real, full coverage, and absolutely nothing less than that."

The texture is really like a concealer; drying, thick and powdery with a matte finish. I mix with moisturizer and SPF when applying to my full face, then dab it on breakouts to blend with a stippling brush. It makes my features pop but I look a bit dead (too white) without rubbing some off my cheeks and nose. You definitely get a lot of value, and this looks great in photos, but I'll be seeking a more sheer foundation for everyday."

When I went to wash it off, I couldn't. I tried cream, exfoliation, cleansing balm, make-up wipes, all to no avail.

Recently I bought this new formula and I am so disappointed. It peels when I apply it and is not flattering on my skin (it starts to melt off by the time I get off work so within 8 hours) nor is the shade I use accurate anymore.

Overall, the foundation didnu2019t look dry on my face, even when I tried it for the first time and didnu2019t heavily moisturize (except for a couple of small areas). Perhaps if you have oily or combo skin you would have a different experience. What I liked most about this foundation is that it was breathable and didnu2019t feel like I had full coverage foundation on. It looked like my own skin, but better. While Iu2019ve tried foundations with more coverage, this one would suit my needs since I just want my skin to look better, with a balance of being lightweight.

I made it work by applying it with a brush and then wetting my sponge and pressing the foundation in. That method made it look less thick and more skin like.

The shade range still need some work as well. I was sent 2 colors to test, one was way too light and the other was way too dark. Maybe they have a better color for me. I had to mix the two. This foundation is thick and extremely full coverage. If you have tons of hyperpigmentation and like a matte finish then this may be for you. To me, the shining star is the brush.

Right now in December, Iu2019m probably doing a 4:1 ratio of 24S to 34B, but in the summer I can pretty much wear 100% 34B (I wear sunblock and big hats, but I work outside and always seem to catch some sun no matter what lol). I also use 100% 22S under my eyes and on my cheekbones as a subtle highlight.   I have combination skin that can get very dry and flaky. This foundation is perfect, it feels semi matte. If I need more matte, I just brush on some translucent powder in those areas. I never seems to dry out my skin, and it doesnu2019t settle into my creases or get cruddy. If you have oily skin and donu2019t set with a powder or something, it may not wear as well. If you have very dry skin, moisturize well before application and do not set with powder. I change my approach based on the area of my face and how my skin is feeling that day, and this foundation easily adapts!   I have a really great skincare routine, and I tend to not have trouble with blemishes. I also do not wear makeup for very long, extended periods/during rigorous activity. So I cannot say if this is going to be enough coverage for everyone, or if it will last through an 18 hour shift of bartending. I will say, the times Iu2019ve fallen asleep in my makeup after a late date with hubby, Iu2019ve woken up the next morning still looking very pretty. And Iu2019m not ashamed to say, I have just touched up my slept-in makeup and gone to early doctors appointments Iu2019m running late for the next day. I typically look pretty much like the night before! So, thereu2019s that haha."

Yet Iu2019m left disappointed only for it to fail halfway through the day. Failure is not an option with Tarteu2019s Amazonian Clay 16-Hour Full Coverage Foundation. I no longer have to worry about my makeup not lasting. What Works best is to start with a fresh clean face and apply a moisturizer before it sets. I start my foundation before my face is dry so it prevents the cake look and makes blending easier. Tartes Amazonian Clay Foundation is very light with a mouse like formula that is buildable. I recommend using a small amount to start as a base. Then as needed You can build up to your desired coverage. I like how this foundation matches well with my skin tone. I used 27S light-medium sand (light to medium skin with warm, golden undertones) which evened it out.  The pores on my nose are reduced and gives my skin an overall smooth natural look. Blending the foundation with the brush into the skin from the center out to the hairline is a must to avoid streaks and patches. Itu2019s time to let your foundation out wear you and give Tarte Amazonian Clay 16-hr Full Coverage a try because failing just isnu2019t an option."

Some benefits are that it is full coverage. I do apply it as they recommend with finger tips and then blend with their brush which I did receive along with the foundation. That was a huge plus for me. I go for a full coverage foundation normally that is semi matte or matte. I did need to set this with a powder which I don't like doing because that tends to make my face extra dry later on.

It came with a bamboo brush that was wonderful for a flawless application, and using that brush really did provide an airbrush appearance. And the coverage was really good.   The reason I did not rate this 5-stars was due to the shade. It really was not a match, so I truly couldnu2019t evaluate it fully. I could possibly use it as a concealer or as a highlighter but it could not be used as a full face foundation for me. And that makes me sad because itu2019s a great formula with great coverage and it wears very well.   So, if youu2019re able to find the shade for you (I definitely recommend testing it in person. I donu2019t really think the pictures of the foundation represent what they will look like in person), I would recommend trying this foundation, especially if youu2019re a fan of full-coverage."

The foundation claims to not crease but I did have creases form at my smile line (but this happens with all my foundation). I would say it has a high coverage, but I wouldn't call it full because I still had to used concealer to cover some blemishes. The foundation does oxidize from when I first applied it and the colors were not as I expecting as they do not match the models on the tarte website. I had three foundations that were suppose to be neutral but I thought that only one was truly neutral(12N). The second one was more warm orange(14N) and the third one was more peachy pink(18N). I would still recommend this foundation because it sits well on the skin and the coverage is good, but you need to find your shade. In the photo it goes from left to right 12N, 14N, 18N and the swatch from top to bottom is 12N, 14N, 18N and the swatches has been on my arm for a while and has oxidized already."

It really last 16 hours actually longer than that because I fell asleep  by mistake and woke up still fully covered! Its light weight and you don't need alot so a little really does go a long way. It not only covered up my dark spots and blemishes but it also stopped the shine and improved my skin's clarity and texture while it hydrates and reduces flakiness. The Tarte Amazonian clay is my new FAVORITE full coverage make up for sure and I definitely recommend it to anyone who's looking for full light weight coverage."

I used it by barely dotting only in the areas in needed for age spots and hyperpigmentation and blended it out with either sponge or brush. The brush it came with is nice, but not my favorite. Itu2019s to soft for such a thick formula. It did last the day looking fresh but I think this product is more suited for the younger skin that is tighter and less fine lines.

Some positives about the product include: the smooth mousse consistency, full coverage, and long lasting feature. Your makeup stays put all day and is blendable. I did remove a star simply because I felt my combination skin felt dry after using the foundation even with an ultra rich moisturizer on the bottom.

The foundation also lasted for the full 16 hours as promised, without fading or smudging throughout the day.  One of the things I love most about this foundation is that it contains Amazonian clay, which helps to nourish and balance the skin. It's also formulated without parabens, mineral oil, phthalates, triclosan, and sodium lauryl sulfate, making it a great option for those who are conscious about the ingredients in their beauty products.  Another great thing about this foundation is the wide range of shades available, making it easy to find a perfect match for my skin tone. The formula is also lightweight and easy to blend, giving me a natural and radiant finish.  Overall, I highly recommend the Tarte Amazonian clay 16-hour full coverage foundation in shade N57. It's a high-quality product that provides beautiful, flawless coverage that lasts all day."

I was DELIGHTED when I received three different shades to try out to see which would be the best color for my skin since I am mixed and have trouble finding my exact shade with any line. So with over 40 shades to choose from--I was stoked!   Now. This is where my excitement died. I opened the boxes of each one and was worried as soon as I saw the bottles. If they were clear and indicated the shade at first glance, I just knew none of them were going to work. The shades were WAY OFF. Like, they were not even remotely close to the sample color on the computer screen that was presented to me. I even held it up to the screen to compare. These shades are at least two or even three shades LIGHTER than depicted on what I saw. Here on Sephora site it looks a bit different. The darkest shade still made me look like a ghost. I was very disappointed.   I give stars though to the coverage itself. Had it been my actual shade I think I would have really liked it. It really covered well. I just had to add my other foundation on top of it. : /  But let me talk about that buttery blending brush! I am OBSESSED with it. So that also deserves some stars. That brush felt so soft and amazing on my skin and it blended rather well. I will be using that brush daily from now on.  So all in all--I would be open to seeing my actual shade. But it would be a challenge to determine what that even is without going to a store."

A little goes a long way, no joke, don't over do it, it is intensely, full coverage.   I LOVE the bamboo fiber brush that came with it. It gives a smooth and well covered application process and leaves a smooth finish.   Individually, both colors didn't match my skin tone, I made it work by mixing it together, now it's a tad difference. The main issue I come across with some foundation is, despite having yellow undertones, I end up with those that leaves almost a gray coverage, it's hard to explain but I then use my concealer with a little more color, to give it life lol.   Since the foundation boasted on 16hrs of coverage, I decided to test it for 13hrs before tapping out. While I didn't need to reapply or powder my face, I had to touch up oil all over my face twice, after the first 4 hours and then 3 hours after that. There is a small and barely noticeable separation around the most oily part of the face by hour 6 but everything else stayed intact.   Overall, pretty solid foundation that didn't settle in all my crease lines. Love it and definitely recommend this!"

A beauty blender I was not a fan of with this foundation but their brush is amazing! Wears well, not creasing or Caking. Smells really fresh but not perfume smell which is another bonus! I do recommend this foundation and am thrilled to have been chosen to share my thoughts for Tarte through BzzAgent to do a review and received this makeup for free. I love that the foundation stays put. My Clinique which I love however did transfer which was not great. Thia 16 hour wear however stays! I love it!!!! Thank you Tarte and BzzAgent for the free products in exchange for my honest review. I can honestly say we have a winner here and I am thrilled!"

The range of options for skin tones is great. I'm able to move between the three I received fairly easily while still creating a natural look. The only downside was that after about half a day or so, I started noticing more shine on my face. It's easily covered with a complementary powder so not a deal breaker for me. I'd recommend this foundation to anyone looking for great coverage. Tarte products are cruelty-free for anyone looking for that bonus add, although I've read that the parent company is not."

With the amount of a dime you can cover your entire face and have an even skin tone. It takes down any redness and smooths you out for an even and balanced base to continue putting makeup on. The foundation goes on smoothly and very effectively covers all over. The brush helps cover face beautifully. Very little goes a long way. Imperfections are erased. My look is more flawless. I love this coverage.   It is not cake like or heavy, very light weight on skin skin, like nothing is there. The product doesn't settle in fine lines and exaggerate them. I have really enjoyed using this foundation. It is well worth the try, and I will be buying this in the future. It works great for a full coverage foundation."

I love the tarte foundation brush to use the foundation.  I got three shades but only one kind of worked for me because I have a tan right now (medium).

My mom said I looked too dark now with the med foundationu2026 FYI, I have light to medium Asian skin if that helps narrow down color choices for your purchase.

The tarte Amazonian clay is everything youu2019ve wanted, everything you need, and everything Iu2019ve described the other foundations donu2019t, this does!!! I am so incredibly satisfied with this product and the makeup brush that came with foundation. Truly Iu2019ve never been as happy with a supplied product as Iu2019ve been with this one.

Like i only have to use a little bit and it gives me full coverage, but still feels like im not wearing anything, and feels like moisturizer on my skin. I use my finger to apply it and then i go over with the buffing brush and im done. Another thing is that although is gives you full coverage it still looks natural and give you that healthy skin look. It also soothes my skin which is amazing and i wasn't expecting that. It does last all day like it says and comes off pretty easily with a makeup remover without having to wash the face multiple times. The bottle is so cute i had to mention that like the wood cap looks so fancy and cute on my makeup desk. Im honestly hooked and will be using it and stick with it for a very long time."

Half way through the day all of the oil was showing right through this foundation. It doesn't transfer easily, which I liked but when it came to touching up throughout the day it became cakey. It did have good coverage. It covered scars and dark spots on my face. I think this foundation would be better suited for those who have more normal, less oily skin."

As well as the softest foundation brush I have ever touched in my life. The three shades I received were 12N, 14N, 18N. For 12N, it is very light, I am quite fair skinned but this was a little lighter than my natural shade but it works great under my eyes to brighten up the area and on red marks from acne to hide the redness. 14N was a shade darker than me but I used it as a way to naturally darken my cheeks to do a makeshift contour. And I think 18N was nearly a perfect match for me. The color swatches on my hand are in order from bottom to top being 12N, 14N, and 18N. The formula is soft and smooth, it blends easily, doesnu2019t look cakey, gives good coverage,it has a scent; not overpowering but like a light perfume scent. Just saying that for anyone whou2019s sensitive to fragrance. But overall I do recommend this foundation."

This is by far the best full coverage foundation with matte finish I've ever tried. The formula is so airy and lightweight, a little goes a long way so please do NOT use a lot! I see a lot of reviews that say it looks caked and that's because you are not using it right. You literally need a dime size for a full face. Less is more! The coverage is beautiful, it literally diminish the pores and it looks like the most natural filter! If you have dry skin, mix with a drop of a hyaluronic based serum like the Glow Recipe Drops. It lasts all day long!! Looks amazing on camera and in person. If you have texture skin or skin issues, again, use less so it doesn't look cakey and set with translucent powder! Chef's kiss!!"

I believe that I have found my new favorite foundation! It especially worked well with Tarte's Foundation Brush which helped to apply it evenly over my skin.

It definitely held up to medium coverage (could also be used for full if another layer is applied) and it stayed on my face evenly from the time I applied it in the morning until I took it off at night. I'm not sure how this product works for other skin types but I HIGHLY recommend it to anyone who has combination skin. It has been a miracle for me!"

Hard to describe!  It's airy and almost goes on like whipped cream.  It spreads easily and covers everything from under my eye (blues) to blemishes (reds) and everything in between.  I don't feel like the 16 Hours is quite there.  I have oily skin and found my flush/redness showing through after only a few hours, but I reapplied and went back to looking flawless."

Matches my skin tone to a T, very nice fluffy, mousse formula, definetly lasts all day. You feel like you have nothing on. I highly recomend it and will be using it from now on."
