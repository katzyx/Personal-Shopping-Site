Their Shade range is stunning and the neutral shade I have is really nice. Not too yellow or not too red, matches really well with my skin. Im 13N! Their Shade range is impressive for a clean brand. Seems like Sephora may no longer carry this brand with this drastic sale which is a shame if so cause this foundation is STUNNING. I tried it in the wrong shade since it's on sale here (also thought it MIGHT be my shade, just had to go one or 2 down!) and even ifs it was the wrong shade, I knew I had to get it in my actual shade because it was really good and took over my current favorite of a year 1/2 the Nars Light Reflecting foundation. My Nars foundation got messed up during travel and I was going to repurchase, but the Nars foundation isn't perfect for my preference, I remember wanting to try the rose inc foundation so much.  I've used this every other day for the past 2 & a half weeks during outings in humid Texas heat and with products I like it and it definitely is one of the best. It did not break me out, did not accentuate any textured dry areas. I even bought the concealer and that's really good as well! Their lipstick is lovely too hehe.   I've tried many foundations and my personal preference is something light that doesn't get greasy during long wear with a softer natural almost seamless skin with a soft glow. I can't speak for all skin types but definitely works best for me with acne prone/ dry combo with a bit of oily skin. That looks gorgeous in photos and in person. This is quite natural with a nice amount of coverage with a nice glow and is buildable. With the right products this could be it for you also because for me it's definitely perfect and I'll be repurchasing this."

Iu2019ve been using this foundation for two months, I tried so hard to love it, bc I got compliments since the foundation color is literally the same as my skin so it looks like Iu2019m not wearing make up at first, and yeah it does what it promises but the longer I wore it the more I noticed itu2019s flaws.  (Iu2019m used to the ester lauder (best foundation in the market used it for 10 years nothing compares. sometimes I like to try new ones just bc, but always go back to ester lauder)  Anyways, I noticed it only last about 2-3 hours, it literally falls off and I see reviews that says it doesnu2019t make their face oily, but it makes me look like a glaze donut, it doesnu2019t last, it TRANSFER so much even with primer, setting powder and settings spray nothing works , I canu2019t even hug anyone.

I thought this foundation would work great given the brand tries to use ingredients good for the skin. But it has black pepper extract. After I completed some research, I discovered that it is rated high for skin sensitivity and can be highly irritating. Be careful if you have sensitive or reactive skin. In terms of wear, I think it looks good for 4 hours and then starts to break down on oily areas. Similar to others, I find the foundation sits on top and does not really set it. I use LM talc free setting powder and Lisa Eldridge setting spray (holy grail). I can't return this product since it past the 60 day mark. A complete waste of $75. I've become ruthless to purchase from brands that use good ingredients but I will be more vigilant. I'm going to stick with higher end brands such as Victoria Beckham Beauty and Lisa Eldridge. I do like some Rose Inc products, but this has really put me off."

The undertone is great, a lot of brandsu2019 neutrals end up being way too cool/pink for me, this was a great match. I was surprised by how thin and liquid the foundation itself is, even though it says to shake it before use, it is still very thin. If you donu2019t like thick foundations I guess that would be appealing, but I felt like I had to keep on applying pumps because it did not cover enough (I think it is more of a light to medium coverage, and definitely buildable). What I do 100% enjoy about it is that it feels like NOTHING on the skin, itu2019s the most lightweight foundation Iu2019ve ever tried. So if you do not like wearing makeup or feeling cakey I also think youu2019d enjoy this one. I particularly was just expecting it to be more full coverage, but still would recommend."

I can't speak for how it wears yet because it's only my 2nd day. It doesn't seem to burn my skin like the MAC which I believe is caused by the chemical SPF in it, plus it doesn't make me look like an oompa loompa after it (eventually) dries down - I say eventually, because it takes a long time IMO. I wouldn't call it skin-smoothing, because I have had to use a primer to help disguise my enlarged pores, and it definitely looks better after it is set with a powder and spray. I don't think Rose INC. sells a primer, powder, or setting spray. Hmm.   I may put up with the extra work for the shade, because it's extremely hard for me to find a foundation match. It's pretty expensive though and I kinda expected a better performance on it's own."

I felt the cold, wet snow just hit me in the face. It was so windy I couldn't even keep my hood on. I didn't check my skin again until later that night at home.

This covered them all, no cap. I didn't use a primer but powdered and used a setting spray. It lasted super well all day, which I would expect for the price. Also the color match was perfect. Overall I think this is worth the price based on other foundations I've tried. It just covers so well and looks so airbrushed.  Currently I am having issues with settling in fine lines around my mouth, but this has been an issue for me no matter what product I use as I've tried over 15 different foundations. I don't think it's the fault of any of the foundations I've tried to be honest. I am going to try the ordinary smoothing primer and will update my review when I see how that goes."

First of all, I got shade 2N, which apparently has neutral/olive tones instead of just neutral, and at first glance I thought it wouldnu2019t work for my slightly cool tone skin. However! It worked perfectly :) The texture is very smooth, light, and luxurious. This immediately gave my skin a soft-focus matte finish that did not emphasize several dry patches I have. I would describe this more light/medium coverage instead of medium but I think it would easily be buildable. As is the coverage is perfect for me. My skin looked so smooth and my pores were nonexistent! There was a very slight smell when I pumped the foundation out but it disappeared after application. It lasted all afternoon in the Florida heat as well. I love that itu2019s non-acnegenic/noncomedogenic. Rosie has said she deals with acne so I appreciate that detail - Iu2019m still dealing with it occasionally in my 40s. Really adore this foundation!"

Covers the redness in my t-zone and some sun spots with ease. Leaves a soft smooth matte finish but not too matte that it looks dry on and it lasts all day.

This checks all the boxes for me in what I look for in a foundation, which is extremely rare: cruelty-free, non-comedogenic, hydrating AND matte, skin benefits with use, medium-natural coverage, made for acne-prone skin. Coverage is on lighter side, but is buildable and it feels and looks very natural. This does not set into any lines. I usually have makeup show in my undereye creases and I don't like to powder that area since it can really make my under eyes dry and pre-age me. This is the first foundation that I don't have any creasing or settling into lines. I have oily/combo skin and I always have to set my whole face with a powder. I don't have to with this one, which is another first. I absolutely love how this feels on the skin and it wears beautifully throughout the day (I might even argue it looks better as the day goes on). I also have acne-prone skin and have not had a single break out with use. It can cling on to some dry patches, but properly moisturizing before use changes that. My only gripe about this line is I wish there was a larger shade range. I'm hopeful we will see more in the future since this was just released. It does oxidize slightly after use, which is why I am able to get away with 8N. Just wish there was a warmer/olive tone lighter than 10W."

Olive undertones are not walking around looking like little green aliens; we have a slight bit of green in our skin, and our skin can still can lean warm, cool, or neutral. As such, this shade really is my perfect match. It's more muted in it's color, meaning no bright greens, no cool pink, no orange - just a perfect match for fair neutral olives.  The foundation itself is extremely comfortable to wear, and once applied, it feels like nothing. It does not feel drying on my skin nor does it exacerbate breakouts for me (I am writing this review at a week of wear). It looks natural; the definition of my skin but better.  There are some intriguing skincare claims in here too, including adaptogens and humectants, with the brand stating these ingredients may help to plump, smooth, and minimize pores. While it's hard to attest to the long term benefits at this point, I do feel the formula leaves my skin looking smoother and more even while wearing the foundation.  Overall, I am incredibly pleased with this product!"

This foundation pleasantly surprised me with its lightweight, serum-like feel, natural finish, and buildable coverage. It transformed my complexion upon application and held up exceptionally well for 8 hours. Consistent use improved my skin's texture, minimized pores, and imparted a healthy glow. Plus, it being vegan and non-acnegenic/non-comedogenic is a significant advantage, making it an ethical and skin-friendly choice. In short, Rose Inc's Softlight Skin-Smoothing Liquid Foundation is a must-try for its impressive qualities and skin-enhancing benefits. Highly recommended!"

For reference, my closest shades in other brands are Armani Luminous Silk 6, Estee Lauder Double Wear in Fawn, and CoverFX G+ Medium 2 (closest).  I was initially worried it would be drying but it looks like second skin on me. It immediately smoothed out the texture of my skin. It's very lightweight and lasts all day. I didn't see any significant wear after 8 hours. It has a medium/buildable coverage and you don't need a lot to get a no-makeup makeup look. It's a great mix of comfortable and long lasting.  I'm very impressed by this foundation and glad to finally have a shade match in an amazing formula. It was my first product from Rose Inc and I'm motivated to buy other products from them after trying this out. If you have a combo or oily skin type, you'll love this this since it is non-comedogenic. Dry skin can make this work very easily too (prep well if you use it in the winter).

This foundation is vegan, non-acnegenic & non-comedogenic. I chose 7C Light Cool and it was a perfect match. Based on my before picture, it's obvious that I struggle with random red patches, undereye discoloration and dreaded sunspots. My skin immediately looked smoother, more even and helped disguise my trouble areas.  It feels lightweight on my skin and while it's obvious that am wearing foundation when I glide my fingers across my face, it still feels surprisingly smooth with little to no drag.  After wearing it for several hours my skin still looked natural and had minimal shiny spots! My only minor issue is that certain parts of my face (cheeks and around my mouth) did clearly show dry patches but I attribute that to the drastic change in weather and my need for more moisturizer at this time of year.  Overall I will be using this on a daily basis to see how my skin reacts to consistent use."

It will still look good, because the formula doesn't seem to separate on the skin even when it gets a bit dewy, but a touch of setting powder in the T-zone makes it look a lot better.

Its lightweight feel, buildable coverage, and ability to conceal my rosacea were definite pros. However, it didn't deliver on pore minimization and struggled to maintain its appearance throughout the day. I've found it suitable for a more natural no makeup look on quieter days, and I appreciate the brand's non-acnegenic, vegan, and non-comedogenic aspects. Despite its shortcomings, I'm interested in exploring more products from this brand due to these positive attributes."

I have combination skin and it kept my oil in check through most of the day. I like that it doesnu2019t settle in your pores or fine lines and wrinkles. I recommend it."

Although itu2019s serum like, a little goes a long way, so one pump is enough for your whole face."

While I wouldn't categorize it as sensitive, within a few days of using a skincare item or foundation I sometimes have to quit using it because of acne and blemishes.  Rose Inc Softlight Skin-Smoothing Hydrating foundation is an great foundation for me because it works with my reactive skin.   So when I tried this I knew I had to give it a few days and so far so good. No acne or blemishes.  The consistency is liquidy and more translucent than other foundations I use. When applied it reacts like a serum. The finish is matte without being drying. It is like a creamy matte, It is easily buildable to get the coverage you need although one application is enough to cover the face well. After a full day it doesn't make my face oily.  So I like it. My only complaint is I think they need to do something better about the models on the page because I got the wrong foundation and it was too light for me. I feel like the models don't match the foundation colors. I chose based on the model."

I used a trusty powder puff and a light spritz of elf setting spray, and this foundation played nice. Now, age ain't nothing but a number, and this foundation knows it.
