I donu2019t find it to be particularly moisturizing, though.

I just turned 40 and decided to try to add this into my routine. I noticed after I started using it, though, I started breaking out.  I convinced myself that maybe it was a purge similar to a retinol purge because of the cell turnover this product causes so I stuck with it, thinking that fresh great skin was within reach, but the breakouts didn't stop. I held on for 13 weeks but never stopped breaking out. I took a few days off, Mt skin cleared up, then I have it one last shot thinking (hoping) maybe it was a purge and I was finally on, I put the lightest bit of this on my skin once it had cleared up again, and by evening I had a fresh pimple. So, if you can use this and not break out, then I'm jealous and stick with it. But if you start breaking out just remember that it's not likely a purge. I don't have particularly sensitive skin, I'm not sure what didn't work for me in this product, but it definitely did not agree with my skin."

Firstly, you'd think a thick cream like this would coat my dry skinned face nicely right? Wrong. It leaves a thick film that feels exactly like putting grease over your skin. It's absolutely grodie. & NOT worth the $95 dollar price tag when it doesn't even feel luxurious to begin with. Save your money, there's better out there for sure. This feels like I just got done working a 14hr shift at a fast food joint, ew."

I am 30 years old and don't really have fine lines, but I'm starting to get marionette lines. I've been using this product for about 3 weeks, and the lines have become much less noticeable. I use it in the AM, and it provides just the right amount of moisture and does not sit on top of the skin or leave a film. It also smells amazing. I was really hesitant to try this because of the price, but my skin basically exclusively loves Fresh products and doesn't break out on them, so I gave it a try. Fortunately, I only need to use a tiny amount, so I hope the jar will last a long time. I'm not sure why this should be almost $100, but it does work, and I guess I have to buy it since my skin is a total diva."

I think it is lighter than I thought it would be in terms of texture but it moisturizes well and overall gives me a nice tone in the morning (it is part of my nighttime routine). I think I will have to give it more time to really see the results overall when it comes to the fine lines and wrinkles I have. So far it is a pretty good product but the cost I think is a bit much - however if I continue to use it and it really tackled those fine lines as it claims to do then I think I will repurchase.   Also, it does have a very Flo rally scent so be aware prior to purchasing. I find this creams floral scent is a little stronger than the black tea firming mask."

While I donu2019t yet have deep set wrinkles, I did notice an improvement in my smile crows feet - they were less noticeable to me. My skin did seem like it was a bit more youthful - like in my early 20s (probably thanks to those ceramides) - so that was fun. I personally love the smell of this cream and while I have combo skin, the thickness of the cream did not make my skin feel weighed down or icky. It was actually perfect!"

I am a rare and severe cancer survivor, and everyone who has experienced chemotherapy knows how damaging it is to your skin.   I am constantly looking for things that would assist in restoring the moisture and firmness to my face, which this cream does!  First and foremost, the texture is incredible, leaving my skin feeling radiant and silky. I'm 38 years young, and I'm just now getting into skincare (I know, a bit late), so this product was a no-brainer.   What I like most about this is the smell. I like scents that are light and not overbearing, and this one fits the bill! This product may be used during the day, at night, or both. I've been using this as my night cream and have seen a significant improvement in the fine wrinkles I had before using this product. It's as though the little creases had filled in some way.   I also observed that the dark patches on my face (from previous breakouts) have swiftly lightened and are practically GONE! This is a new take on retinol as this is much more gentle on the face.  This is defiantly much safe on your pillowcases when applying this to your face at night. I promise you won't wake up with bleached pillowcases. This is pillowcase-approved, LOL.  I will undoubtedly become a repeat customer!"

And in light of full disclosures, while the Black Tea range has quite a few of my favorites, I was never a fan of the Corset Cream. This one, however, is absolutely brilliant. It has perfectly creamy (medium-weight in my opinion) texture, glides on over my water-based serums like a dream and delivers ample moisture both AM or PM. Impressive ingredients include Ceramide NP, Rambutan (part of the brand's trademark complex which mimics many benefits of traditional retinol sans irritation), Squalane, and antioxidants. There is a faint aroma reminiscent of the iconic soy cleanser, but perhaps a bit more mild. My skin is looking rather glowy ever since I incorporated this newness into my routine. Very very happy with this launch."

While Iu2019ve always loved Fresh as a brand, itu2019s been a while since Iu2019ve invested in a luxury moisturizer. When I tell you this moisturizer is luxurious, Iu2019m not just referring to the cost. Letu2019s break it down:  Ingredients: Fresh is a clean beauty brand, so I can feel good about using it in my daily routine. For this moisturizer specifically it includes BT Matrix which is like retinol, but is *not* retinol. This is important for me because I am nursing (retinol is not recommended for those who are pregnant or nursing).  As Iu2019ve ventured through post partum and my early thirties, I need a moisturizer that can even my skin, address aging concerns, and is gentle. This delivers on all counts plus some.  Fragrance: A nice, light, floral and citrus scent that is not overpowering and dissipates quickly.   Texture: At first it seems like this moisturizer would be thick and heavy. Itu2019s not. While it is rich, it is not oily or sticky and does not leave a film on your skin. It wears beautifully under makeup and spreads easily.  Results: I feel that this moisturizer has helped tremendously in a short period of time. The photos included are a 5 day difference. It has reduced redness and has even helped alleviate a breakout. When I put it in I feel that my pores are smaller, fine lines arenu2019t as noticeable, and I truly glow. I feel radiant and beautiful when I put it on. Having a moisturizer that I can wear with or without makeup that makes me smile when I look in the mirror is a huge deal for a busy mom like myself.  Invest in this as soon as possible. You wonu2019t be disappointed."

I have pretty normal skin with dehydrated patches, especially on the tops of cheeks and my forehead, and I was impressed after the first application. The cream is nice and thick. Has a fresh scent that's like tea and it just melts right into the skin.  It absorbs pretty quickly and leaves my skin feeling so moisturized and soft to the touch. It also gives me a gorgeous natural glow and it's become my new favorite cream to use for skin prep before makeup! The best part has been all the compliments I've received on my skin since I began using it. I highly recommend this cream!"

This light but rich cream that Fresh beauty gifted me has a strong, beautiful tea scent. I had hoped it was naturally-occurring, but it does include added fragrance.

For reference, I have sensitive combination skin. This moisturizer comes in a nice and sturdy packaging. As you open it, you'll immediately recognize the unmistakable smell of the Black Tea line. The texture may seem thick in the jar, but the cream itself is lightweight and goes into my skin right away. I have started using it in combination with the Age-Delay Firming Serum and the results are wonderful. I could really see a difference in the firmness and radiance of my skin.

This high-performance face moisturizer from Fresh u201cworks to visibly reduce deep set wrinkles while improving skin firmness and radiance.u201d It also has rambutan leaf extract! Truly innovative.  Packed with ingredients, this product aims to be a lighter, more sensitive skin-friendly, replacement for retinol. So same correcting signs of aging and radiance benefits without the actives.  As for my experience, I love the glow it gives me. Itu2019s creamy but light, easily applied. Iu2019m fortunate to have little to no wrinkles and maybe this will help prolong that! I used it for 2 weeks, morning and night.   One thing to note is there is the tea/earthy scent. It may not be pleasant for some but Iu2019ve learned to love it!  This retails for $95 which is steep BUT considering it promises to have benefits that replace the retinol in your skincare, I think this will be a good buy if youu2019re in the market for a new moisturizer! I stand by Fresh beauty products. They are amazing!"

Iu2019ve been using it for about a week, and I have noticed it is high impact for smoothing. I suspect this is a result of the cream being a bit more heavy than I would have expected (as the description says it is for oily-normal skin), and of course rich in humectant ingredients that deeply hydrate.  In my before & after, you can visibly see that it contributes to smoothing my skin. However, my skin is a bit more red in the after pic. I do wonder if I have a mild allergy to something in this product (fragrance blend, perhaps?)  I noticed the reviews are torn between the scent being strong vs light. I think this depends on how used to fragrance you are. I have gone mostly fragrance-free, and as such, it seems stronger to me. If youu2019re used to fragrance, I think you might deem the scent light.  Honestly, I think this is a product to sample before purchasing in order to see if the scent/texture will work out for you. Hopefully Sephora will offer minis for sampling! Gifted by Fresh"

I'm not sure if it's the fragrance that is a bit irritating or what it was? I love that this is formulated without retinol so I can use it in conjunction with my tretinoin rx. Would I recommend this?

I've been using this as part of my night routine, and my skin feels sof tand smoothed upon waking up - no extra facial oils needed like I usually have to do during winter. This is a win for me! complimentary from Fresh."

The cream has a luxurious, silky texture that glides on smoothly and absorbs quickly into the skin. It has a subtle, pleasant scent and leaves my skin feeling hydrated and rejuvenated. One of the standout ingredients in this cream is the black tea ferment, which is known for its powerful antioxidant properties. It helps to protect the skin from environmental stressors and promotes a more youthful-looking complexion. The formula also contains hyaluronic acid and niacinamide, which work together to improve skin texture and reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles. Overall, I highly recommend the Fresh Black Tea Age-Delay Cream to anyone looking to improve the appearance of their skin. Its combination of nourishing ingredients and delightful texture make it a pleasure to use on a daily basis."

It has a fragrance that I canu2019t quite identify, but itu2019s probably the black tea. Iu2019m not a fan of the smell, but it disappears after a bit. My skin feels nourished while wearing this overnight and in the morning my skin isnu2019t dry. I havenu2019t noticed any major changes in my skin, but Iu2019ve only been using it for a short time. Perhaps if I used in morning and night, I might have seen some improvements to fine lines or firmness. Looking forward to finishing the jar.  I appreciate that this was gifted by Fresh."

But,  unfortunately for me, it has an overpowering fragrance that smells like a perfume you'd spray on your body. The scent lingers. I'm not sure why companies in 2022 are electing to add in extra (non-natural) fragrances. They can always lightly improve the scent with plant extracts, or just leave it non-scented. For me, I couldn't continue using it on my face due to the overwhelming fragrance. It's also overpriced."

It does not negatively impact the user experience, although for me it does not enhance it either. I live in a humid environment (south Florida), and still do not find this product to feel heavy after applying. It goes on thick, but thins out once it starts to absorb and feels ultra hydrating. All in all I am really enjoying it, although I can say I have notice much of a physical difference in the appearance of my skin that would justify (at least in my mind) the $95 price point. At that price, I would really like to see more clinically-effective actives.

I have been using the moisturizer for about 4 days so far, and I can definitely see more radiance, barely and wrinkles or fine lines, and it just feels more tight/firmer.It has a beautiful smooth texture, that is packed with hydration and keeps your moisture barrier jam packed with moisture. It does leave a slight grease feel after using, but the longer you hang on, the more it dissipates. I am obsessed with the radiance it leaves. I would recommend this to anyone who has mature skin, and combo, normal, or dry. Also, it's super expensive. I could probably pay about $50, but $95 is a lot."

So whatu2019s inside? Antioxidant black tea, rambutan leaf extracts, and squalene which work together to visibly reduce wrinkles, improve firmness and boost collagen production.

I saw an improvement in my skin and it looks a lot healthier and glowy than before. The little wrinkles under my eyes are slowly fading away and looking more plumped.

I love that it isnu2019t heavy, nor greasy but itu2019s sooo hydrating. I have huge pores on my nose and tzone area so sometimes using heavy moisturizers can clog them easily, but this cream is the perfect balance of hydration for my skin. Highly recommend! I was gifted by fresh to share my honest review."
