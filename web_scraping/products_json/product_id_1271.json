            "review_text": "This brush is versatile and handles both powder and cream formulas which creates a flawless finish.  I used the larger end of the brush for powder application and swept it across the apples of my cheeks and blended upwards toward my temples. The bristles picked up just the right amount of blush, distributing it evenly for a softer focused airbrushed look.   I used the shorter end of the brush for the cream blush. It worked beautifully and the product into my skin. My complexion looked dewy and had a radiant glow too.  I also applied the product to my nose and sides of my forehead for a natural look.   I loved how the bristles were soft and smooth against my skin.  I cleaned them and there was no loss of shape or shedding of the bristles.  The gold handle was luxurious. It traveled well and works wonderful for applying bronzer too.  It is convenient for using for more than one product! I love having a product that does more than one job!

The bristles on this brush are incredibly soft, densely packed, and as the name implies- very precise, even given the brush is larger since it is meant for the face. I snapped these pictures as soon as I unboxed because I wanted to capture her beauty before getting into product. My favorite side is the thinner + longer side meant for a cream contour. I'd resorted to using my fingers to get my cream in the right place, but I'm so happy I can use this brush and keep my fingers clean (and not get contour all over my face!). The saying is true, an artist is only as good as her tools and this is a MUST HAVE for anyone struggling to quickly and effectively apply bronzer/contour on a daily basis."
