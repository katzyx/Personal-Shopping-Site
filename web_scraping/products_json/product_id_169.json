First of all you get a lot more for your money than similar type and quality products. Second, you don't need much, but if you accidentally go overboard you aren't going to have to rewash your hair. Third, versatility. touch up dry hair as well, but your dry hair will not need touching up because your frizz is not coming back. When they say long last, it will last forever and it will be the last of its kind you ever want to use. I recently lost most of my hair and it grew back curly, I hate it and not having the lifetime of curly hair experience most women with curly hair in their 30s have, this has saved my life. Well, this and a blow dryer with a built in round brush!"

Thank you Bumble and Bumble for making such an awsome product."

I have medium textured, frizzy, curly hair that I blow out.  I live in the northeast and have been using this product (that I purchased) during a pretty humid summer. The good-definitely provides softness and I am able to achieve a bouncy, beachy blowout with this product. Great brush glide.  You have to be careful not to over or under apply-some products are more forgiving that way. The bad-there is absolutely zero frizz protection in this product. You will need a separate product to address that. I bought this for the frizz control aspect so that was disappointing. I will say however, I may enjoy this during our cooler months when frizz isn\u2019t an issue. If you have fine hair this may be too heavy, if you have thick hair, not heavy enough. I wanted something more I guess.  I\u2019ll be able to finish this up but I doubt I\u2019ll repurchase."

I applied it on my damp hair and then blow-dried as usual and the results were fantastic. My hair looked healthy, smooth, and even sped up drying time. I went outside on a hot day and my hair didn't get frizzy or big like it usually does. I've only used this for blow-drying, so I can't really say how it works for other types of styling.

I made the mistake of applying a lot first time I used it but you really just need a small amount. My hair the next day felt greasy so it\u2019s best to wash your hair the next day."

I typically avoid using heat on my hair in the warmer months, so I was thrilled to see how well this product worked for transitioning from day to night. I kept my hair in braids all day while working, and when I added the Invisible Oil at night, my hair transformed into beautiful, voluminous waves without any greasiness. The best part? Zero frizz! My hair felt soft, looked shiny, and had incredible volume. I'm excited to try it with my hot styling tools next, as it also serves as an excellent heat protectant. This BB cream for hair truly lives up to its hype!I\u2019m"

I am already a fan of the invisible oil line from BnB but was curious how this would fit into the lineup. I went ahead and applied the invisible oil heat protector then added this styling cream on top. I was very worried this was going to weigh down my hair.   This made my hair plump! It was slightly thickening, as my hair felt full and had pretty good hold on my blowout when fully dry. Surprisingly, my fine hair did not feel heavy just fuller and very smooth. I had like zero frizz! I also feel like the tube will last a long time! I used a quarter-sized dollop and feel like I could use even less.   I'm really happy with the results and look forward to continuing to use this!"

The blend of oils, including Nangai Oil and the Featherlight 6-Oil Blend, leaves my hair incredibly soft, smooth, and shiny. Plus, it provides great protection against humidity, which is a game-changer for me. Another bonus is its heat protection up to 450\u00b0F/232\u00b0C, which gives me peace of mind when using hot styling tools. Applying it is easy; I just put it on damp hair and style as usual. It also works well on dry hair for touch-ups, making it a versatile addition to my haircare routine. The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is that, while it works wonderfully, it sometimes feels a bit heavy on my hair if I apply too much. However, once I figured out the right amount to use, it\u2019s been a fantastic product. If you're looking for a styling cream that offers hydration, frizz control, and heat protection, this is definitely a product to consider."

Now on the bottle, it does not specify how much to use\u2026it just says to apply to damp hair (or to dry hair to restyle or as a finisher.) luckily for you, I was able to make the mistake of using too much - so you don\u2019t have to! You really just need a small amount, I\u2019d say about a dime-size amount depending on how much hair you have. I applied about 2x that originally, and it left my hair feeling weighed down and just\u2026yuck. After washing that out of my hair, I tried again with just a small amount - roughly a dime-size. My hair looked and felt so much better! This hairdresser\u2019s invisible oil is literally magic! I have been trying to baby my hair back to health, so I really just keep my hair back in braids to protect it and don\u2019t really use styling products or anything. But this is a styling product that helps your hair as you style it! I will be using this every single day from here on out, and I think it\u2019s about time I invest in the rest of the hairdresser\u2019s invisible oil line."

The cream provides heat protection up to 450\u00b0F, helps reduce heat damage, and smooths the hair. It gives flexible hold and helps maintain the hairstyle even in humid weather. I appreciate that the main ingredients are Coconut Oil, Argan Oil, Grape Seed Oil, Macadamia Nut Oil, Sweet Almond Oil, and Safflower Seed Oil. This oil blend is very hydrating and nourishing, making my hair very soft. I also use the styling cream between wash days to restyle my hair."

If I go on vacation ANYWHERE I need to bring an entirely different hair routine. My hair will be a frizzy mess no matter what because the different water and the humidity. This product is stunning I\u2019m not even kidding. I used the invisible oil leave in conditioner and that changed my life. This is just as amazing. I am so happy to have them both in my life. It protects my hair while making it smooth and beautiful looking. It also stays that way for way longer than I expected. I love. Please never discontinue"

The best part is 2nd day hair is the same way!"
