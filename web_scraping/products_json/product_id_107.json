Another sad thing was the taste.. I know Iu2019m not supposed to eat my lip products but I canu2019t help that I lick my lips lol, but if you use a balm afterwards you wonu2019t taste it.

I like the tint it gives to the lips, but it tastes TERRIBLE. It's best to put it on a little on the inside of the lips for a subtle look. It also dries out your lips so hard but the tint spreads on chapstick/ lipglosses. No biggie but still."

When you blend it out w/ your fingers it absorbs into your fingers so there is no pigment on your cheek. when you use it as a lipstai, it dries tacky, rubs off easily and is super discoloredu2014also it tastes AWFUL. the milk jelly blush stuck is so much better tor because itu2019s even, easier to blend, and about the same price for MORE PRODUCT! pls do not buy this ud83dudc80 there  ther"

I definitely prefer to apply it using a brush rather than a beauty blender or fingers. I put 2 dots on 1 cheek then blend with the brush and then repeat with the other side. you also must work fast because it's drippy and it's a stain so you don't want circles and lines going down your face because you didn't blend it in time. I also love using it as a lip tint too, it's amazing. this is my second bottle in 2 months (I got the smaller beginning of August and use it everyday for school). 10/10"

I usually blot off the excess lip balm then apply a little bit on my lips for that extra tint. I've used it on my cheeks before and I'm not a fan of it as blush but as a lip tint/lip stain- chef's kiss. Will 100% be buying again."

However it doesnu2019t last as long as itu2019s talked up to be. Within an hour the lip stain is gone and within two the cheek stain is gone. Itu2019s a shame because this really is such a good product. The bottle is also veryyyyy small for the price. I mean does it really take $26 to formulate a little red stain? Overall great product but price and longevity ruins this from being amazing. Would definitely repurchase though."
