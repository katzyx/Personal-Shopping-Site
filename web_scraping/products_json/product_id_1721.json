This set contains: Flourish Shampoo for Thinning Hair, this shampoo has a clear yellowish gel texture with a mixed herbal, floral, and citrusy scent that is very pleasant. It cleans all the build-up on my scalp and lathers well. Flourish Conditioner for Thinning Hair, this conditioner has a thick milky white cream-like texture, almost like a hair mask consistency. It has the same scent as the shampoo. It detangles, nourishes and hydrates the hair without weighing it down. Flourish Density Booster, it comes in a spray bottle to make the application easier. Itu2019s clear and watery and has the same scent as the shampoo and conditioner but is more intense. It doesnu2019t bother me, but it might for some. This complete set worked and reduced my hair fall within almost two weeks of usage every other day. It works gradually, thickening a few spots on my scalp that are visibly thinning. Iu2019m so excited that this worked. Thanks, Virtue Labs!"

The products are not drying on the hair and also help with an itchy scalp."

The conditioner is kinda heavy for my taste. I have to use a very small amount or it leaves a residue in my hair which makes it look greasy. I havenu2019t used the density booster long enough to see any results yet but I will keep using it daily. I do like that itu2019s non-greasy and doesnu2019t weigh my hair down.

I've only been using the set for a week, but I already love it! After pregnancy and weight loss, my hair is lacking volume, so I was excited to try this product. And I'm happy to say it didn't disappoint! The set includes everything you need for a hair care routine, and the best part is that it's made with quality ingredients that are gentle on your hair. After a few uses, my hair felt softer and smoother, and it was easier to manage. But the real game-changer was the volume it gave my hair! I haven't seen my hair look this full and voluminous in a while. Even my husband noticed the difference and complimented me on my hair!"

It does a good hobbit cleaning the hair and giving the root volume without making the hair frizzy or overly dry(like with volumizing shampoos Iu2019ve tried).  The conditioner is supposed to be used mid to ends and my hair felt hydrated but not weighed down.  The booster is backed by clinical data. It comes in a spray bottle and has a spa like scent - very relaxing. Youu2019re supposed to use it every day and on average it takes me 5 minutes to section my hair, apply the product and massage it.  This product was gifted by Virtue Labs."

But while this is not enough time to really see new hair growth, I do feel that my hair looks overall more healthy. I also really like everything else about the set.  The shampoo has a nice texture and leathers up beautifully. It cleanses well and I can get away with washing my usually greasy scalp every 2-3 days.  It does have a scent to it that is pleasant and refreshing. The conditioner also does a really good job of smoothing out my ends and has the same, nice fragrance. I applied the treatment spray every day. On days where I was planning on wearing my long hair down, I prefer to apply it over night because it adds a little bit of texture to it. But when I was wearing my hair up or in pony tails, I usually apply it in the morning. The spray also makes my hair smell really nice. While these are all smaller samples, they are definitely big enough to try for a full month and I can't wait to see what the results will be over the next two weeks.  I hope I will see some fuller hair but even if not in these 4 weeks, I might try it out for longer as I really enjoy the shampoo and conditioner in general"

It has a very nice herbal scent.  I will continue to use it a lot.  I really loved it.  I always recommend now."

I can't say that my hair looks noticeably fuller yet, but I have seen a significant improvement in the amount of hair that falls out in the shower. Formerly, I was cleaning out handfuls of hair from the shower drain. Now, I find only a few strands - about 5-10% of what used to fall out. I'm beginning to see baby hairs starting to fill in.  The shampoo and conditioner have a very mild scent. The booster is quite scented, but I think it smells nice.  The only downside is that the shampoo/conditioner only lasted me 60 days (I bought a 90-day supply), but I do have rather oily hair. The booster will certainly last the full 90 days. I've already repurchased the shampoo."

Absolutely try this line if you are struggling with hair loss!"
