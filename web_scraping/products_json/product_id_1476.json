My skin has always been prone to dryness and redness, especially during the winter months, but this serum has been a game-changer. The texture is lightweight yet hydrating, and it absorbs quickly without leaving any sticky residue. What I love most is how it has visibly improved the firmness and plumpness of my skin. My fine lines are noticeably less visible, and the overall tone of my skin looks more even. I've even noticed that the persistent dry patches on my cheeks have completely disappeared! This serum has become a staple in my skincare routine, and I can't imagine going without it. Highly recommend for anyone looking to hydrate, firm, and rejuvenate their skin!"

While this serum sinks into my skin nicely, there hasn't been a noticeable improvement to my skin yet. I'll definitely use the whole thing, but the results haven't lived up to my expectations. It is great for sensitive skin, though!"

Iu2019ve used this maybe 9 times over 4ish weeks and my skin has a glowy, protective, oiliness to it that itu2019s just never had. No dry crusty skin. No flakiness on my nose. No constant blackheads.  Paradoxically, because I would have thought oily would mean more breakouts, my acne is almost gone and it previously needed constant benzoyl peroxide and clindamycin daily for 3 years to deal with an ever-present outbreak of forehead acne. I feel like I can take a breath for the first time in so long. A whole life problem is now off my shoulders, however small it may seem. It turns out my skin was bothering me more than I thought. I forgot what it was like not to live with such damaged skin. Anyway, if youu2019re on the fence, I say give it a good go and stick with it for a few months.

When I applied them together, by the next day, my skin looked tighter and more youthful. It also helped with my mature adult acne. Because of a medication I must take at the moment, my skin has aged rapidly and gotten horrible acne (they're two of the million side effects of the medication), but thanks to these two I have finally seen a breakthrough after trying so many serums from Sephora, like Youth to the People, etc. Nothing I've tried before had worked so fast. As a side note, I also use Retin-A, the highest concentration which is 0.1%, but only once a week together with this serum. The rest of the days I use the Summer Fridays retinol and this serum. As a person who was always told I looked 10 years younger and now I look my age (thanks to the medicineI must take), this serum has been is a blessing because it has diminished my wrinkles tremendously, and helped heal my acne."

Since itu2019s thicker I do like to use this at night rather than the morning, but with the tackiness I can see it working well under makeup. At night it layers well with my other products and I feel like my skin looks smoother. A wonderful serum Iu2019m so happy to have tried!"
