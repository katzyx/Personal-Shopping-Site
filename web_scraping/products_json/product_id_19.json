I also want to add that I have extremely sensitive skin and this moisturizer hasnu2019t triggered any sensitivity which is rare for me. Last, I found that this product layers well with sunscreen and makeup in case you were wondering. I highly recommend it without a doubt!"

It has a somewhat bouncy texture, but is incredibly creamy and moisturizing leaving my skin instantly feeling more plump and hydrated after application. I have combination skin that leans more towards the dry side especially during the cooler months and this cream has been excellent for me applied at night. It isnu2019t greasy or oily and absorbs quickly into the skin leaving my skin feeling firmer abd revitalized and looking more youthful, and radiant.

Itu2019s instant results using this moisturizer. Now despite this being great I am very unsure if I would get this again because of the scent. When my husband can smell my face from feet away you know itu2019s a problem. Itu2019s not a perfume scent more like a bad medicinal scent. It eventually does fade out or maybe you just get used to it? If you can get passed odd smelling skincare this is one of the best."

And this one has been a perfect in between. It's hydrating but doesn't turn my tzone in to a grease pit. First off the texture is neat. It's like a fluffy jelly almost. I thought it was gonna be super thick but it's surprisingly light. A little goes a long way. So the travel size should last a while. My daughter says it's smells like honey buns every time I use it. Which it kinda does. It's a light pleasant smell. Right away after using it my skin looks plump and bright.

The scent is mild and pleasant, and the moisturizing power is amazing! Iu2019ve been incorporating this treatment in my daily routine after washing my face. It makes my face feel moisturized, supple, and almost feels like a cool drink of water for my skin. It really helps with moisturizing and reducing the appearance of fine lines. My skin look plumper and clearer and feels brighter and hydrated. I like the formula because it applies smoothly and evenly, and a small amount goes a long way. I appreciate effective vegan ingredients like microalgae oil and vegan collagen. Itu2019s a perfect addition to my winter beauty routine!"

I am fortunate in that I do not have very dry skin.  I only get a tad dry in the winter.  I do not find this cream to be particularly heavy at all.  A little goes a long way.  I just warm about 2 pea sized amounts in my palms and then press this moisturizer into my skin.  Pressing the moisturizer versus rubbing the moisturizer all over the skin makes all of the difference in the world.  This cream melts into the skin.  It is divine.  In the morning I wake up with super soft, plumped hydrated skin with noticeably diminished wrinkles.  My skin gets better with each and every use.  I noticed a review wherein it was mentioned that this moisturizer pills upon application.  That is not the fault of the moisturizer, it just means that you have applied this moisturizer over another product that is not complimentary, you are not giving the skin enough time to absorb the other products prior to application of moisturizer, layering silicone upon silicone, or you may need to manually exfoliate prior to application( I am a professional makeup artist so I know all about piling).  If you are not excessively dry, and are looking for a reasonably priced cream that will transform your skin overnight, give this one a go.  Not sure what I would do if Algenist ever stopped making this cream."

I might add that I'm in my early 20s so this cream may work better for someone with mature skin. I also found the texture of this cream especially odd (very strange consistency).

I use this and the eye moisturizer which is also really great after using Youth to the People Superberry Glow Oil and notice a definite improvement in skin tone and glow. I do think it helps with wrinkles also and firming up the neck some. Generally I do notice it helps  with aging. One thing though is it smells like vanilla frosting and I wish they used a rose scent instead or maybe something more citrusy. The smell is more mild than in the cleanser for this line which is horrible!!!"

I found that the consistency made it hard to get a good amount out of the jar and on my face without being wasteful. This was really annoying with the eye cream version, where i normally wouldn't need to use as much. I also didn't think this cream did that great of a job moisturizing dry spots. I still woke up with a bit of dry skin. Pros: it does really do what it says as far as firming and smoothing the skin. At 35, i really was looking for something to help with firming and texture and this really did a nice job at that. I've been using it for 4 days, morning and night and already started noticing the difference. My skin looks tighter and smoother and my makeup looks much nicer too. I am very impressed, but will likely need to add an oil to my routine to help with dryness. Word of caution: if you have sensitive skin/allergies, this can cause a little bit of a reaction. I had mild redness and itchiness when i first used it but it quickly went away and it didn't bother me as much. I think the benefit outweighs the mild reaction i had and would recommend trying this cream (just do a skin test first if you're sensitive like me)."

I was in the market for a new moisturizer when Algenist brand rep Astrid (my new favorite human being) suggested Algenist. She was super honest about it and told me she used it herself. Her skin, flawless, I might add. Also, as a person of color, not all products are geared towards our skin so it was important for me to know Iu2019m using a product that can handle its unique properties. Iu2019ve been using it for about two weeks now and my skin has never looked better! Itu2019s brighter, moisture balanced and a lot tighter and firmer than before. I even had a scar on my face from using a curling iron and it has begun lightening and fading since using these products. I love that it doesnu2019t have an overpowering scent and is great for sensitive skin.   Donu2019t be put off by the price! We will spend so much in makeup to conceal errors, but the best investment is in your skin. And trust me, a little goes a long way! So I definitely recommend and I know you wonu2019t regret it."

I love to use it around my eyes especially, though the directions advise against that. I put it on at night, and in the morning I notice that my face looks very healthy. I loved this product as a sample, but probably wouldn't buy it if given the chance. It's not a bad product by any means, but I have had others that smell and look better, though the results are relatively the same. In the end, I want my night time routine to feel luxurious after a long day's work, and while this product works well, it doesn't have any of the glamour of other products like those in the Clinique range."

I do not notice it helping any of the small wrinkles around my eyes but it does absolutely plump my entire face and gives it that springy feel it used to have in my youth. It also does not break me out, which is a huge problem for my sensitive skin. The softness I get with this product is what I've always been looking for and I'm so happy I finally found it. A little goes a long way...I have best results when used sparingly all over and then another tiny dab on my trouble spots."

My face glows and its smoother than ever. I may have good life Gene's but I look 10 years younger. No one believes my age because I devotedly use my face products. I'm so glad I discovered this cream and my mom was converted as well and she loves it. During the summer time, I just used this at night time.

Great brand overall and I like some of their other products, but won't be using anymore until they work that out.   Overall, I really like this cream.

Feels wonderful putting on, like moisturizing marshmallow cream!  Most surprising of all, I honestly believe the Genius/Power combo actually shrank the large pores on my nose and chin versus making them worse, which was my fear with heavy moisture - seemed to have a refining effect on my face as a whole. My skin is brighter, smoother, and just better looking--my husband noticed and I've seen the changes myself.  I've actually had to use less foundation to avoid my face looking too smooth/made up because it looks better on its own now, a first for sure!"

I am in love with it and now firmly refuse anything else on my skin.  It's so silky and comfortable.  Absorbs easily, makes my skin very soft, smells divine and make up goes on a dream.  The 30ml will probably last at least 8 months, so the 60ml should last about a year.  That is under $10 a month.  You don't need much and it feels like absolute luxury. It does make a noticeable difference to my skin, with a reduction in lines and dryness and gives a general healthy suppleness.  I won't pretend that it will have any permanent effect, but it makes my skin look so much better for the day or night ahead. A good skin day!  Love, love, love Algenist and now I never want to try anything else! Just a tip, my local Winners/TJ Maxx sometimes have Algenist at a reduced price.  Just sometimes.  But honestly, when you buy the Genius Cream, you are buying a year's supply.  So don't be scared of the price.

I've tried numerous products and this has been the only one I've found that has helped to diminish the fine lines. I plan on repurchasing this again once it runs out, rather than experiment with a new product like I'm usually inclined to do. I'm not crazy about the texture, but I've gotten used to it.

It does feel quite heavy, but it doesn't leave greasy residue, I find it absorbs into the skin quite nicely. Though I do have dry-normal skin with an oily chin and I barely apply this to my chin to avoid breakouts. So warning to ladies with oily skin, it may not be for you. All in all, I say purchase this if you are looking to battle early signs of aging. It's a great product, and while pricey, it find it works better than those similarly priced products I've tried. A little goes a long way with this too. Using every morning a 1oz jar lasts me about 2-3mo.   If you want more details- I'll share my experience below. I feel like it's hard to tell if a product is truly having a positive effect on your skin. We know right away if we're more oily or breaking out, but a bit more radiant, fine lines getting finer - that's harder to see, Esp when we look in the mirror every single day. After using this product for about a year I switched to a different high-end lotion with brightening enzymes. After about 3 months I could see the difference algenist had been making that I just didn't realize. Those 3 months without it, my skin lost radiance, fine lines became much more noticeable and the scarring from the random cystic zit I'll get every now and then on my chin doesn't fade as quickly. The biggest shock is the tone of my skin. It's not as even as it was, and that tacked on with how dull my skin is I no longer feel confident leaving the house without some tinted moisturizer and highlighter. For the first time in my life, I cannot attribute stress or diet to this as I've been very healthy and have taken time off from work. This is 100% because of the change in face cream. Algenist is most definitely my holy grail and I won't wander from it again. I highly recommend it!"

Everybody's skin is different, what works for some may be disastrous for others, (always ask for a sample, or start with a trial size) but for my combination skin this is amazing. After the very first use I woke up with moisturized, plump, silky skin!! The best part, I was 50% less oily in my t-zone, and that is a big deal for me. In the evening after cleansing, I applied the Algenist Power pressed serum, waited a couple of minutes,  and applied this. While the consistency may seem odd at first, you start patting it into your skin and it literally melts into the silkiest texture that your skin will drink up!! If this continues working well for me then I think I've finally found my HG moisturizer! Give it a shot."

I could see the flakes and scales under my bb cream and foundation. I honestly tried so many different products to correct this over the last year and found many failures and a few products I liked. Murad Hydro-Dynamic Ultimate Moisture not only broke me out but did not help my dry scaly patches. This product is fast absorbing and actually moisturizes. I almost didn't buy this product line because I was so skeptical and after researching it I couldn't find any outside reviews by dermatologists or estheticians that were positive. I decided to try it anyway because so many can't love it if it works so horribly and I am very glad I did."

A little goes a long way, as the pricing suggests. Unfortunately, I don't think I'll buy it again unless it comes with a sensible applicator. Using too much of it is just a waste of good ingredients (and gives my face a strange -- not oily, mind you -- sheen), but its weird gel-like tacky texture captures all the dust (and skin cells, I'm sure) from your fingers, making the daily experience rather repulsive. Perhaps I would feel differently had I used a butter knife as an applicator from the start. Sadly, I think that experience ruined it for me."

I've sometimes put it on after something else irritates my face, and it helped soothe that too. With this, my skin feels soft and smooth, without ever being overwhelmed by the product."

This is not a perfume-type scent but has more of a lightly sweetened food-type scent (some describe it as a vanilla custard scent).I do not find it to be strong and the scent dissipated practically on contact. I do not like perfumed facial products so I am perfectly okay with the scent and find it pleasant. If in doubt, try to smell it in the store before purchasing.  I have very oily skin and use this mainly at night. It works very well as a moisturizer and is just what I need to keep my skin well-hydrated from the outside. It is not greasy or thick but substantial enough and smooths easily onto the skin. Sometimes I use a bit for daytime but since it does not have spf, I have to make sure to add something that does.  It is in a jar and there is always a concern about bacteria and product longevity. I can't comment as I have not done studies on this or read any pertaining to this particular product. I would prefer it to be in a bottle with a pump because that would definitely help with these two concerns.  This cream feels so nice on the face and absorbs easily. I do not like the price but was able to get it at a discount so that helped. I do use the Genius eye cream as well and look forward to trying out more Algenist products in the future."

The trial actually CLEARED UP breakouts which I realized were being caused by the Origins moisturizer I was using (in the past I'd typically get 1 zit every 2-3 months). Really like magic, and others noticed too which made it even more compelling.  I purchased the full size immediately. It was a really great moisturizer for summertime since it's not oily. I am hoping that it holds up enough in that sense as the weather is getting colder and dryer.  I am only 26 and out of the sun these days, so I don't have much aging beyond fine lines, although I have noticed a decrease in the 11 lines I had just begun to notice between my eyes. Also have noticed an overall increase in firmness/plumpness along with a noticable decrease in wrinkles in the areas which (for my face) I feel are more wrinkle-prone: smile lines around the mouth & line going across the middle of my neck (please don't forget about your neck, ladies).  I'd go so far as to say this goes a step beyond making your skin look good until you take it off. I really do feel I could attribute this to a more permanent improvement than most moisturizers are able to offer.  One lingering question that piqued my curiosity (which I had read in a beauty blog) is regarding the packaging for this product. It was brought up that these types of moisturizers containing these types of ingredients should be packaged in more air-tight containers, and if not then they lose some of their benefit from the oxygen getting into them. I would be curious to know if there is anything to be said about this, or why this may or not matter for this product.  All of that being said, I am definitely a believer in this product. It has cleared up my skin, diminished fine lines, and enhanced my skin tone + texture.. It doesn't smell bad either, and is long-lasting."

            "review_text": "This is my first review. I love this cream so much that I had to speak out! Though I felt satisfied with my previous night time system, I was getting a noticeable forehead wrinkle. Since I was using a really good (and expensive) system, I thought that it was all part of aging. Well, one night I ran out of my night cream (ha, I don't even remember what it was though I used it for years) but I just so happened to have had a forgotten pack of the 10-day sample of the Algenist Genius cream. Since I have lupus and need a moisturizer with strong UV protection, I only used it at night...and still within 10 days, my forehead wrinkle faded. By 20 days (I used half a pack a day), it was gone. I would say a good 90% of the day is spent with my face scrunched up in either pain, concentration, or just plain weird facial expressions (what can I say, everything shows on my face). The fact that it can smooth out the wrinkle despite my best efforts to put it there was amazing in itself but the smell is also delightful. I could honestly swear that it smells like carrot cake with cream cheese icing! To me that's a bonus because I love the smell and it makes me feel like I had dessert even when I haven't. At first I thought the price was too expensive but when I used another night cream after it, it just smelled artificial and felt wrong for my face. I only held out for a little over a week then I had a piece of carrot cake and I caved! I'm so glad I did! Now I can skip the dessert that goes to my hips and use the one that gets rid of wrinkles!"

What this DID DO for my skin: plumped skin and kept fine forehead and eye lines looking less noticeable; made vast improvements to dry patches on nose and forehead; went on light but after a few hours could get a bit greasy; did not cause any breakouts. What is DID NOT do: no real improvement to a few light sun spots or dark spots on jawline or forehead; no improvement on a few lightly broken capillaries (light redness on cheeks); no noticeable long term anti aging results. As a moisturizer, this was excellent and its plumping is nice for any dull skin or small fine lines. I really don't see any dramatic results to my existing aging issues but I can see how this cream can help prevent over-drying and new line formation. Oily skin may not like how greasy this can become a few hours in, I recommend this more as a night cream for them. For the price factor, I had better results with Elizabeth Arden Prevage but this was still nice for a fancy moisturizer."

            "review_text": "My skin responded visibly much better in the ways I was looking for and wanting it to w the Algenist Firming and Lifting Cream than it did w this Genius Cream. I was able to test both for a few weeks/about a month each thanks to a nice sized deluxe sample jar of first the Firming and Lifting Cream and then I used the 10Day Challenge promo code for this. Instead of using up an entire packette each day, I just cut open all 10 packettes and refilled my empty jar which made it last literally weeks longer (I actually still have quite a bit left even after using it for way over 10 days!) In my opinion, this is a very, very good cream. But it just did not do all it promised for me, maybe it will for others, but I was looking for certain results that their Firming and Lifting Cream delivered but after my sample of that ran out and I started using this, I saw my face losing the benefits I'd achieved w the Firming and Lifting Cream. So, I decided to just drop the cash for the regular sized Firming and Lifting instead of continuing w this Genuis Cream. I now use what I have left of this as an extra layer of moisturizer over everything on nights I feel I need more hydration and it will probably be great as the weather turns to Winter.  This cream is formulated and advertised to restore skin resiliency and elasticity, delivering a firmer, tighter, more toned appearance. It strengthens the most fragile skin texture, softens facial contours, visibly minimizes fine lines and deep wrinkles, and unveils skinu2019s youthful radiance. I did not notice any tightening, firming or toning, sculpting, etc. that I'm looking for. I feel this cream is more rich feeling, less gel/souffle texture and feels heavier on the skin but it is not too heavy or greasy and seems to be absorbed well. I think this cream makes your face feel hydrated more and for a longer period of Time than the Firming and Lifting. I saw some small amount of wrinkle reduction and feel this cream would be a better choice for those looking for those results as well as to strengthen and restore skin resiliency and elasticity, as well as longer lasting hydration and possibly w continued use that youthful bounce restored to skin and maybe even it will unveil skinu2019s youthful radiance by keeping it hydrated very well as to make skin appear dewy. This IS a really nice cream to use, goes on well- rich but not too overly rich... it's sort of like a whipped but still rich texture, if that makes any sense, it does have a scent but I really do not smell all o this sweetness or vanilla others report, to me it smelled like a mature powder scent and I'd rather no scent to my face creams (like the Algenist Firming and Lifting Cream.) In the end, it did not do everything it promised, specifically the firming, tightening, sculpting, and toning parts so I decided to go with the other product. But, I AM thankful that Sephora gave a decent amount of sample product to actually be able to see if the product will reallydo as it claims. Also, NO breakouts! When searching for a great face cream, it causing my skin to breakout is my WORST FEAR!! BUT, I have sampled many Algenist products since they became available through Sephora and not one has caused me sensitivity or acne breakouts on my nonsensical combination skin that gets VERY oily and shiny in the oily zones. I'm going to use my leftover Genius as a final top layer on nights I still feel I need more hydration."

More glowing, smaller pores, less noticeable fine lines, and tighter in general. Love this product. I would like a travel size option as the packaging is heavy.

I purchased the full size and have been using for 1 month. The jar is somewhat small, but heavy glass so it makes it seem as there is a lot of product in it .The product inside has a cream -gel consistency I do not yet notice an increase in skin firmness, but the scent is strangely addictive. That doesn't justify the super high price tag to me. It is non irritating, but when I read claims of patented anti aging breakthrough, I have high expectations. I don't think I have seen the results claimed yet. FYI: when I see the word luxurious in descriptions-- to me, it means indulgent and overpriced!"

I am 38 with no major wrinkles, just some creases by my eyes when I smile and a small one on my forehead so that could be it. BUT you would think I would see some type of difference with a genius cream that costs $110. After this trial period, I returned to my Clinique moisture surge night mask and Tarte eye cream... my face felt and looked much better and had more of a healthy glow. I just cannot justify the price of this product, considering that my Clinique works even better for me/ lasts longer, and is $32."

My biggest fear is a product that clogs pores, causes breakouts, or burns. This product exceeds my expectations and is delightful to use & wear. It has hydrated my dry areas without leaving a greasy or heavy feel. It has cleared and soothed my redness and overall brightened my skin tone in a very short period of time (days/weeks) not months! It's rich, luxurious, thick yet lightweight and absorbs fast. It smells great and truly seeps into fine lines to help minimize them. I'm a result based person with some budget limitations but when I come across a product THIS good, I believe we get what we pay for. I'd like to see the product come in a tube or pump so that bacteria from fingers doesn't transfer into and contaminate the whole jar - that's my only criticism. I highly recommend it and hope all who read this review find it helpful toward finding a cream you enjoy. :)"

It doesn't have a definite sweet scent, a bit like soft serve ice cream (ever since I read that somewhere, I can't get it out of my mind - it pretty much hits the nail on the head). It is not cloying - I definitely don't go for sweet or vanilla scents but do not find this one disturbing. It's consistency is a creamy gel. It spreads easily and absorbs quickly, never leaving a feeling of something sitting on the skin. Just velvety softness.  I have also found that it works quite well under primer and/or makeup.  The only thing that could improve it for me? Bigger jars - I seem to be flying through this cream faster than other ones although the content is the same. Probably as I use it 2x a day instead of one. And the price. But - to me - it is worth it."

It is easy to apply and has a very nice scent - light and fresh. It does not absorb really quickly. I do use it twice a day, morning and evening. I don't generally use foundation per se so I don't worry so much about the rate. By the time I am getting dressed it is absorbed. I have not used this long enough to determine whether or not it will live up to its claims. However, I can feel the softness of my skin for the entire time between uses and that is a first for my dry skin. I also think the age caused wrinkling I sometimes get in the cleavage area is less apparent due to increased moisturizing. Still, it been only 2 weeks so, I'll see. Now as to price. The 3 figure price for 2 oz. is a LOT, for those of us who are frugal. After all, one is instructed, for best results (does anyone want less?), to use twice a day on face, neck and chest. So, it may well be that we are looking at need to purchase at least monthly. I sure hope the results will, in the long run, justify the price."

I have to admit that up until this year (I'm 40) I haven't exactly taken good care of my skin. With that said, in the past year I've started to really have issues with my skin. I have trouble with redness, uneven texture, bi-polar combination skin (extreme dryness AND oiliness), and wrinkles. In the past year, I've tried so many moisturizers and serums and haven't really been impressed with anything until now. The first night I used it I woke up to noticeably smoother skin. After the first week the texture, redness and dryness was dramatically improved! I've even noticed softening of the lines around my eyes and forehead. I'm not exactly sure why a lot of people are complaining about the scent- it's a very light vanilla scent which I actually find soothing. The texture is almost like a whipped cream-gel and it goes on so smooth. I wear mineral makeup and now I literally wear half the makeup I used to because my skin is so much clearer. Someone commented the other day that I'm really lucky because I have such great skin. It is pricey, but it's a huge jar and will last a long time. It's worth every penny! You won't be disappointed."

I've only been using this a short while, thats the reason for not five stars - too soon to tell. But so far so good."

I wish it came in a tube or pump for the Anti-oxidants to remain stable and to avoid contamination. There are other products that do the same thing plus more for less with better packaging and contain more ingredients like peptides. I feel its over price and will only purchase again if the packaging changes and the price goes down a bit. I think that $85 -$89 is reasonable for this basic luxury cream."

I love the lightweight feeling when I put it on and the scent is pleasant and not overwhelming.  For the price, I will probably refrain from buying when I finish this jar. Again, I bought it to fade the age spots and redness on my face and it did nothing for that AT ALL."

Just think - it's $110 for 2 ounces, and many moisturizers are around $50 for 1 ounce, so 1 ounce of the product would be worth $55, so basically you're just getting more at once and you won't have to replenish as often. It's really an average price for an effective product that is totally worth it! MUCH better than Fresh's black tea age delay cream, like ninety bucks for an ounce and it's not half as nice as this.

I think for me that was the best quality, the fact that it made my skin look like glowing porcelain. I don't know how it would work as an anti-aging on more mature skin but I did notice a smoother texture and a slight plumpness to my cheek. This for me works more as a fabulous moisturizer more than an anti-aging cream and I would need to use it over time to see how drastic if any the results could be. My skin is sensitive so it was nice to not have any breakouts or irritations using this product as it was very gentle on the skin."

My pores seem smaller, my skintone more even, etc etc. I have been using this as my am moisturizer for a couple weeks and couldn't be happier with the results! Well worth the steep price tag in my opinion.  (You also only need a very small amount...a big plus!)"

I have very sensitive skin, but this product did not give me even a hint of breakout. It glides on smoothly, hydrates beautifully, and is just all-around exactly the kind of product I needed. I am also very sensitive to scented products, and I like the light scent of this one. I usually put it on after a Perricone serum that smells terrible, and the very light vanilla scent to this product is fantastic, especially in comparison. :) I have been using this cream morning and night every day, and it is making my skin look great! Highly recommend this wonderful cream!"

I had very fine lines except one above and below my lips. Those are nearly gone now too.  I appreciate the science behind this brand and would not hesitate to try other products. The vanilla scent of this cream is luscious too. I'm not big on fragrance in products, but this is lovely.  I live in a very dry climate, so I usually use 100% Pure's Healing Balm on top. This is a treatment cream, not a highly emollient moisturizer, so I'm ok with that."

It does however seem to do a good job of locking in moisture because I wake up with soft, supple skin in the morning as opposed to a grease slick. I took off a star because the fragrance bothers me, almost like a chemically frosting smell. Also, the cream leaves a slight film on your face so it's not good to use it during the day.
