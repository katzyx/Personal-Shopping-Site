Use a brown lipliner or eyeliner instead. Sharpen as pointy as possible. Swirl the tip in different directions to apply. Be sure to blend. Enjoy natural looking freckles with no help from this product."

I've been using it daily all across my face and it's lasted me several months. That being said, even after watching all the tutorials, I still struggled with the product at first.   I have dry/combination skin, and I found that the product worked like a dream on my bare skin. When I tried to put it on top of any sort of foundation, concealer, or even sunscreen, it looked significantly worse and rubbed off very easily. It may depend on the formula, but certain products seem to have a repellent effect that prevents the freckles from absorbing properly. Basically, the product works entirely differently based on how moisturized my skin is, so it's very tricky to get consistent results."

If youu2019re trying to decide what shade to use, the light medium oxidizes a really natural brown. The medium dark oxidizes more to a very dark brown that would be more true to larger freckles. I use a mix of of both. I take the light medium and make little fake freckles that look sun kissed all over and the medium dark to doctor up my real freckles/beauty marks. I saw a few comments stating they wish it was water or off, although that would be nice idk if it would ruin the softness and blendableness of the freckles that helps them look so realistic. Iu2019ve never had a problem with them wiping off as long as I apple them over my powder and use a setting spray"

So here are the main cons:  I was surprised at how difficult it was to get the freckles to look natural. They look best when applied to bare skin, but then disappear if you apply foundation/concealer over top. If you try to apply overtop of your base routine it seems to lift the product off of your face?? I've tried different primers, foundations, etc, and it just looked soo patchy. I also didn't expect the consistency of this product - it's basically maybelline tattoo brow in a fancier package. Don't waste your money. I'll use this up until it runs out but I would not purchase or recommend."

I tend to add them on my temples, my forehead, and the bridge of my nose, and they last all day on top of my skin tint. One star off for the price of the product in comparison with the size, and the packaging- the lid on my tube (I have the smaller size) has cracked from I guess being closed too tightly but I feel like this shouldnu2019t have happened as easily as it did."

Ironic because as a kid I was covered in freckles and very tan from being outside all the time and I hated it :oP  I guess itu2019s a good sign that beauty standards have changed! Now 30 odd years later, Iu2019m 40 and have been using Freck for about 6-7 months. Itu2019s SUPER easy to get good results and over time using it regularly youu2019ll be a freckle MASTER, fs!!!!  I love how easy it is to bolster my natural freckle pattern, OR if I want to go for a bold anime look BAM there it isu2026 just be more precise, let them set longer, add a second layer with no dabbing (first layer dabbed) so they donu2019t look *too* cosplay for every day!  Seriously though - this is better than 1000 anti aging products for skin or concealer for that lack of sleep! Freckles with some dewy skin bring out the youthfulness everyone craves!  Last thing is the price and packaging: 1. Just be conscious and gentle with the bottles! Donu2019t over screw them. I cry for all the people banging their expensive makeup products up (u2018: 2. It might seem expensive for the size, but consider the cost of you mascara or eyeliner!! This goes WAY FURTHER than either of those! Seriously the mini OG was my first purchase in a LE pack with the blush & itu2019s still going!  I bought the XL just for easier handling. One thing to note is the XL seems a tad darker and redder so idk if the formula changed but I got used to it quick.   TLDR: if you like freckles and are dying for the youthful sun kissed glow but go hardcore on sunscreen or just donu2019t sprout your own, GET THIS, it will change everything. No more bronzer, no more anti aging creams, just take care of your beautiful skin *MWAH*"

Application is easy but so much product gets stuck on your fingers it's such a waste. I wish it came with some kind of silicone tipped brush to dot on your face without wasting so much product.  3. Not waterproof and wipe off very easily.  I can achieve almost the exact same results by wetting some reddish brown eye shadow and dotting my face, and its much cheaper."

The other drawback is that when you use setting spray it turns the nice brown shade into a very reddish orange color that looks so weird and honestly so annoying after all the effort it takes to get them on."

Sometimes hard to get enough off the applicator onto my skin, and so you start pressing harder and the freckles get blobby looking.

I then exchanged it for freck noir. Noir has a green tone once the liquid is dried, and is nothing like the photos. At least the original is similar to the photos provided online. I tested a variety of development times for the darker shade and it all left a green tone. Also the dark shade dries a bit crusty, so I have to wipe the dried pigment off.  - Expensive for amount of product.  I think it is a great item if the colors suit you. They look beautiful on so many people I've seen wear them. Just cannot get either shade to work for me."

I checked the Sephora website because I was considering purchasing the regular size.  The small size contains .045 oz. or 1.35 mlu2019s of product for $22. That is approximately $489 for ONE OUNCE! For $6 more, youu2019re receiving about 2.4 times the product! The total size is .11 oz. or 3.5 mlu2019s of product for $28! That equates to $308 for a full ounce!  That is absurd.  The cosmetics industry has an average markup of 700%.  I donu2019t know what the manufacturing costs are, Iu2019m speculating, but I would assume this has, at least, an 800% markup.  This product is a self-tanner.  You can easily take a small lip liner brush and strategically apply your preferred self-tanner in the same manner shown.  I donu2019t have any issue investing in great skincare and beautiful makeup, but this is a ridiculous product that is grossly overpriced.  Hard pass!"

Cons: The application can be tricky - I find that even if I shake it a lot, when I apply it, it looks like I dipped a speck of brown ink on my face. In order to make it look natural, I have to blot it, and sometimes this doesn't work and I have to start over, which is kind of a waste of product. It's also extremely expensive for not that much quantity.   Basically, if you're looking for a smudge proof faux freckle applicator that looks natural and you're willing to put in the effort to figure out the best application approach for you, it could be worth it. If you just want to create fake freckles but are not as concerned with having to reapply, I think a freckle coloured lip pencil (ex. MAC Chicory) is probably a better/more affordable option."

I do like how it can make a look appear more natural; even with foundation it allows for a more u201cnakedu201d skin look.  For the price, the product is shockingly small, and having bought the XL I cannot imagine the size of the original.

I grew up in Hawaii and used to think I was u201ctoo coolu201d for sunscreen during my formative years like an idiot. As a result, my natural freckles and dark spots are very uneven and cluster in random, unflattering areas. I get so self conscious in the summer because I feel like my freckles call attention to the parts of my face I dislike highlighting - mainly, my nose and upper forehead. Freck is my holy grail. I stamp a few clusters to even out the gaps where I donu2019t have any. It makes me feel more confident, which both my husband and my best friend said sounded silly. I tried explaining it as the freckle-equivalent of concealing your dark circles or evening out redness. Itu2019s easy to apply - just dot on in a cluster, wait 3-5 seconds, then tap and copy/paste over the area to make it look more natural. I knocked one star off because it is expensive, and the Light-Medium color is slightly more red than my natural freckles, which tend to lean ashy. Iu2019ve started contouring my natural freckles with Freck so that the red tone is scattered. I went through the mini size pretty quickly, so I purchased the XL which is lasting much longer. Anyway, I use it almost daily. Even on no-makeup days, Iu2019ll still put a couple of Freck clusters on because it looks natural over just my skin care routine. Basically, if you suffer from sun damage and discoloration and you want something to reliably even your skin out, I canu2019t recommend Freck enough. Iu2019m including a photo highlighting which are my natural clusters and which are Freck."

I don't know if mine just came really dried out, if I was sold old product or if there is just a really, REALLY large user error but if anyone knows how to make this wearable PLEASE let me know!  I really wish I could post a video here to show exactly what a mean but this literally just balls up and crumbles off my face. (The photo is a screenshot of a video I took of this happening) The only reason I am even giving it two stars if because there's still a chance I a missing something in the application but for $30 dollars maybe it should just be damn easier to apply. I have read postive reviews and I truly have no idea how people like this.  Save your money and buy lime crime's freckle pen in amber it's a natural color,  $10 cheaper, has a good bit more product and most importantly... it actually works.  Sorry to be so blunt but this is truly a massive let down."

You can let it dry darker or blot the product to leave a lighter stain, which creates a more natural look since freckles are generally not all the same exact color. It does an excellent job of disguising small pimples/bumps as cute little freckles, too. The freckles last about twelves hours on me, and never smear even on spots that rub against my glasses or mask, which I found most impressive of all. However, I have never used this over foundation and would not be surprised if others have found that this product does not work as well on top of liquid or cream base makeup. It probably performs best on bare skin, which is how I've been using it."

I havenu2019t noticed any problems with transfer, and I have hooded lids so itu2019s a concern of mine.

I bought this because I ran out of my eye/eyebrow pencil that Iu2019d normally use to do fake freckles, plus I bought into the hype. Who hasnu2019t seen Freck ads all over social media? I am initially psyched to have a product specifically for doing freckles, rather than appropriating some other makeup product like brow gel or eyeliner pencil. I noticed I need to refill my brush with product after doing a couple of freckles and am experimenting with the proper amount of pressure to apply, but so far so good! The shade of the freckles is extremely natural looking and if I vary pressure and size and place them closer together I get a more natural look as well. I have to be careful about rubbing my nose accidentally soon after applying, because then they will fade or rub off. I didnu2019t notice them fading quickly as long as I set my makeup and keep my hands away from my face. I like it, but I canu2019t give it a full 5 stars because I havenu2019t tried other brandsu2019s versions of the freckle pen for comparison.

My go to is UD matte all nighter but I also tried it with Tatcha Dewy and Herbivore Rose spray. Each time it turned bright orange on my face. I would have to go in and re powder them in hopes of canceling the redness out. They do last all day but the red and the SUPER small amount you get were too much of a turn off for me.

The trick is to lightly dab and blend the freckles in constellations of 3 or 5 and not overdo the amount of freckles you're putting on.

I VERY lightly touch the wand 3-5 times on one side of my nose, re-dunk and apply to the other side, then quickly pat the first side with my pointer finger (which does hold on to the pigment for an hour or two; another option is to pat with a beauty sponge), followed by the second side. This is what works for the look Iu2019m going for and YouTube has plenty of tutorials for different looks and techniques. In short, Freck is so versatile.   Freckles are pretty easily wiped off, which is good and bad. Itu2019s good because you donu2019t have to worry about a funky looking set of freckles stuck on your face all day, BUT that obviously causes problems for all-day wear. To solve: 1) top with a makeup protecting spray, 2) take Freck with you and reapply one or two freckles midday (really only important if you donu2019t want people to notice that your freckles disappear around lunchtime - I love sharing my love for Freck and donu2019t mind people knowing my freckles arenu2019t natural, but I understand if folks want to be more discrete), and 100% avoid touching your face.   The XL tube also lasts a pretty long time, I think Iu2019ve had mine for about 6 months and use it almost daily. Definitely spring for the XL, because the OG ran out in a couple of months for me.   Lastly - Freck has GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE. My first tube had a small problem that made it leak just a bit, I sent a photo to customer service, who apologized so sweetly and sent a replacement, along with a discount code."
