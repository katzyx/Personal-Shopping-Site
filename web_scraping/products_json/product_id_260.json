This 2-in-1 formula, powered by 22 plant extracts and 5 new pure active molecules, feels like a concentrated blend of natureu2019s finest. From the first application, I noticed the texture was luxuriously silky and absorbed effortlessly into my skin without any greasy residue. The light, botanical scent was refreshing and soothing, making it an enjoyable part of my skincare routine.  The packaging of the ampules is sleek and efficientu2014perfect for travel or trial use. The dual-chamber design ensures a balanced mix of serum with each pump, showcasing the thoughtfulness behind its development. Even though I used it three times a week, the hydration and smoothness it left behind were noticeable. However, the sample size didnu2019t quite allow me to experience the full anti-aging benefits that Clarins promises. I can tell, though, that with more regular use, it could definitely address lifestyle-induced aging.  What really stood out was the inclusion of Clarins Eye Lift. After using it for a longer period, I saw a visible improvement in the firmness around my eyes within a week. It was an added bonus that made me appreciate Clarins' commitment to delivering results.  While Iu2019m giving it four stars due to the limited sample size, Iu2019m genuinely impressed with the formula, ingredients, and luxurious feel of Double Serum 9. Itu2019s worth considering if youu2019re serious about tackling the signs of aging."

I love combining this product with the Cryo-Flash Instant Lift Mask, it adds more lift and glow.  The smell is a bit much, but fades away quickly. My skin (which is always sensitive) has only improved in making my pores nice and small, with no breakouts, my skin is less dull, and my skin (normally a desert) has regained its moisture.  Price-wise, expensive, but it is worth buying. The product has lasted me for over two months and it isn't even halfway through. I like the function of being able to choose a smaller pump amount, which helps make the product last longer.  The only flaw I find is the pump itself. When it squirts out the product, it can go flying in all directions, even with a hand underneath. It's so forceful like it's trying to extract a thicker product when the actual product is liquid. The pump needs to be a bit smoother for a liquid product."

However, I tend to avoid them during the summer months when I sweat a lot. This is the perfect solution. Itu2019s definitely more lightweight than the original, double serum, and thinner. For me this means I need two full pumps of it to cover my face and neck well, but someone with less dry skin would need less. It sinks in really quickly and doesnu2019t leave any residue for me, but it does leave a slight suppleness to the skin and what feels like a thin protective layer, over which make up applies very smoothly and evenly. I donu2019t like the smell as much as I do of the original double serum. Currently I use this in the morning and the original double serum at night and my skin has never looked better."

Since incorporating this serum into my routine, I've noticed a significant improvement in the overall texture and tone of my complexion. My skin looks and feels much more hydrated, brighter, smoother, and more radiant than ever before.  This serum works well with my other skincare products and I've noticed that my foundation glides on effortlessly after using this serum, creating a flawless and long-lasting finish.  If you're looking for a lightweight serum that doesnu2019t feel greasy and delivers exceptional results then this is the one for you.

I applied the serum at night after cleansing without additional products to avoid any reaction. Once the serum was in my palm, I was surprised at the consistency. But in a good way! I expected a heavy oil, not sure why when the name of the product contains the words light texture. It looked like watery oil if oil could be watered down :) I also noticed the serum's scent right away. I found it quite light and pleasant. If you are sensitive to scents though, you will notice it. It wasn't overwhelming and flowery but more like a feminine clean, woodsy scent. The serum was light on my skin, and it was quickly absorbed in just a few minutes leaving my face feeling slightly dewy but not tacky or sticky. The next morning, I woke up with skin that looked lovely and not like an oil slick! I only had to splash my face with water and for the rest of the day, my skin felt and looked super nice. I continued doing my simplified skincare routine of only using a gentle face wash in the evening followed by the serum and sunscreen if needed. By the end of the week, I hadn't experienced any irritation, redness, or breakouts. I enjoyed the way the serum felt on my skin, and I felt that my face did have a little glow when it was applied. Although that could have been from the turmeric. Haha! Overall, I hadn't noticed any significant change in my skin, but it wasn't in bad shape and given that the skin turnover rate is every 4-6 weeks that would be the ideal amount of time to see if there was a subtle improvement. *I'm not a dermatologist though so don't that as a scientific fact :) I will purchase this serum because I loved the feel of it on my skin, my skin looked healthy and hydrated/ I'm happy I had the opportunity to try the serum as a #freeproduct from #trywithtopbox so that I could pass on my honest (and lengthy) review!"

The product claims to boost the 5 vital functions of the skin - regeneration, nutrition, oxygenation, hydration, protection - and acts on signs of aging.   I tried this serum for 7 straight days, both day and night as the sample provided. Within the first application I could already see my skin looked smoother. After the full 7 days I noticed my skin looked more luminous and felt firmer. As for smoothing wrinkles, I think I would probably have to use the product much longer to see a result.

This is very much a luxury serum with a matching price tag and while my review on the original version said the cost was a hard sell for me, this updated light version has earned a spot on my wishlist.  I noticed a small difference in smoothness and plumpness, even only using this for a week in the morning. The fragrance is a super faint floral, especially once the serum dries down. But my favourite part about this serum is definitely the texture.  I remember the original not necessarily feeling greasy but definitely heavier than Iu2019d prefer for an AM routine. However, the light texture version works great in both routines. It feels oily when you first mix the two serums but as you rub it in, it melts beautifully and dries down without a hint of residue. I love the effect it gives my skin and how it leaves it impossibly smooth.  If anyone is looking to get me a Christmas present this year, please note that I am a size Double Serum Light Texture, thanks!  *Gifted, thank you @topbox @clarinscanada"

I found it took a while for the serum to absorb into my skin if I didn't warm up the product. I also think it would be better for dry skin types because I have combination skin and sometimes it'll be oil and the product would be too oily on me.

Ive been using several Clarins products regularly over of the years with success and itu2019s one of my favourite brands. There is always some hesitation on my part when trying new products because of my skin being prone to breakouts. Happily, I can report that after using this serum at night for several weeks, I did not breakout and in fact my skin looks and feels healthier. It has evened out my skin tone, eliminating redness and even noticeably reducing pore size. It has a nice, light consistency that is not too thin or too thick, making for easy application.  Absorption is quick and it instantly soothes, feeling great on the skin. I enjoy the fragrance which is light and not at all overpowering. Sometimes a fragrance can trigger my allergies but not so with this serum. My only issue was that when applied at night before bedtime, after cleansing, I would wake up and notice a bit of a sheen to my face, but no irritation or breakouts and no oil control issues during the day. Cleansing removed any sheen. The overall results of Clarins Double Serum have been great and even at its full-size price point, and since a little goes a long way, I will purchase this serum and add it to my daily routine."

The Light Texture serum was even easier to apply on my face and still made my skin look dewy. I did not experience any negative reactions to the product with my combination skin.

I loved how this made my skin feel. It looked brighter and felt smoother too. I only had a week sample but I truly felt a difference. The price point is high but Clarins is top notch and I already swear by their night cream. This will be added to my routine."

I like how there's a slight floral scent that isn't overpowering. I would say you would have to use this product for a longer period to determine if it really helps with wrinkles but from my experience it did leave my skin silky soft and feeling moisturized. Overall, I'm impressed and am interested to see the effects after longterm usage. I also love how the company focuses on plants & their benefits as well as makes efforts towards being sustainable."

I received a 7-day sample sachet pouch, and after the week of use I noticed just as good of an effect as I did with their original serum. To be honest I did not notice much of a difference in the texture, really. The serum absorbs into the skin very well with only a very fine residue. The sachet is composed of two separate formulas, a non-greasy oil and a melting gel, from two different vials that you mix together. The scent is fragrant but not overpowering. I still have that u2018lit from withinu2019 radiant glow. I apply it overnight while I sleep - my skin wakes up feeling very soft and smooth and my complexion looks brighter. My mum tried one as well, and she liked it just as much as the original. You really canu2019t go wrong with any variation of the Double Serum, it is one of the best products on the market.

The reason I keep using this is because it doesn't have a silicone feeling, and doesn't make me break out. It feels very natural with no offensive scent.  I use this after a prescription cream and I have no reaction. For the price point it is the best of the category. Sensitive skin approved. #freeproduct from topboxcircle"

It had a light oil serum texture, not greasy and absorbed fairly well, as someone with oily skin I only used this at night time not during the day under makeup. It layered well with a night cream and did not cause any eye irritation. I perceived that it helped with skin smoothing in terms of bumps and redness over the week I tested it, it did not cause any issues with acne. It does have quite a noticeable scent, like a nice spa herbal scent so there is fragrance in the ingredients. Overall seems to be a pleasant and effective night serum with an apparent scent."

The product absorbed easily and layered well with other products. There was no lingering scent. My skin felt very smooth after using this product, and I enjoyed reaching for this while I had the sample.  The price tag remains the greatest hindrance for this product, but there are opportunities for sales through Sephora etc which can help make this product a little better of a deal.

The serum's texture is very nice -- smooth and non-sticky, but I do feel like I could feel it afterwards. I applied it every night for 7 days straight, and although the trial was short, I do feel like I saw some results at the end of it all. I don't believe it's worth it in the long term though, but that may be because I've been spoiled and found the best thing for me before this.

First and foremost, the light texture of this serum is a winner. It feels incredibly silky and smooth on the skin, and it absorbs quickly without any residue. This made it an absolute joy to use, especially under makeup during the day.  The scent of the serum is delightful - it's subtle and adds a spa-like experience to my skincare routine. It's not overpowering, which I appreciate.  Now, let's talk about the results. Over time, I noticed a significant improvement in the overall health and appearance of my skin. My complexion looked more radiant and felt incredibly soft to the touch. Fine lines seemed to be less noticeable, and my skin felt hydrated throughout the day.  What sets this serum apart is its dual-phase formula, combining both water-soluble and oil-soluble ingredients. This comprehensive approach seems to address various skin concerns effectively. It's like giving your skin a dose of nourishment and hydration all in one.  Would I buy this product? Absolutely. While it may be on the higher end in terms of price, the Clarins Double Serum Light Texture is worth the investment for the visible results it delivers.  Would I recommend it to friends and family? Without a doubt. If you're looking for a serum that offers a luxurious experience while delivering fantastic results, this is the one. It suits a wide range of skin types and concerns, making it a versatile addition to any skincare routine. Clarins has truly nailed it with this product."

I was unimpressed with the sample packaging and had to open it with scissors but once the serum was in my hands, everything changed. The clean, delicate scent is not overpowering nor does it linger. Gently warming the serum in my palms activated it and I patted my face and neck to apply. It soaked in quickly and did not leave a greasy 'film' as some do, and accepted my light moisturizer afterward with no weird mixing or flaking on my skin. There was no residue either and my skin genuinely enjoyed this product. My skin glowed and did not look oily or shiny (you know that shine I mean!) I wholeheartedly endorse this serum. Bonus is that the wee bit that was left over on my palms I put on the back of my hands and even they began to look firmer! Great product!"

It has a pleasant floral-fruity which I like, but not sure for people that are sensitive with scent. The serum claims to improve signs of aging such as wrinkles, radiance and pore size. I use this serum every morning and night, after cleansing and toning my skin.

My skin felt and appeared more radiant.  Unlike other serums, Clarins Double Serum did not have a pungent smell or added fragrance, which tends to irritate my skin.  For this reason, it is quite suitable for all ages, skin types, and is suitable for both men and women.  This light weight product is easy to apply and quickly gets absorbed into the skin.  After each application my skin looked and felt smoother, firmer, and hydrated.  While I prefer to use serums over night, it can easily be incorporated into a morning skin routine.  I will definitely explore other Clarins products!"

I have not applied serum like this before, and I gotta say, I like it! The serum is light, I really enjoyed the scent (Clarins products always smell so luxurious). I only applied it in the evening, and so far, I have noticed my skin looks refreshed and firmer. Did it zap away all my wrinkles -  no.

As someone in their 50s with maturing skin I prefer the OG for my face but might pick this up for my neck and du00e9colletage due to the ease of application on a larger surface area of skin.

After an application, my skin both looks and feels more hydrated. The Light Texture serum is easy to mix in your palm, goes on super smooth and soaks into my skin better than the OG serum. I liked that it left my skin looking fresh. I had a literal glow! Iu2019m also happy that Iu2019m able to apply the Light Texture serum both day and night, and have not had any issues with looking or feeling too oily.

It's helped alot under my eyes as well with dark spots and bags. I starting to get younger. I'm using it in the morning after a shower and the evening before bed. The smell is very light and natural and not overpowering. Very gentle smell. I love this serum and definitely recommend it. #freeproduct"

It's perfect for those who prefer a lighter serum that doesn't weigh down the skin. I've noticed a significant improvement in my skin's overall texture and radiance since incorporating this serum into my daily routine. It seems to have a brightening effect, and my fine lines appear less noticeable. Plus, the fact that it's packed with natural plant extracts is a big win for me, as I prefer products with clean and effective ingredients.

In a week, I have been able to note my skin seems smoother, and the texture is better. I am actually  looking forward to continuing  to use the rest of the samples and seeing the results."

I tried it for a short period of time (Sample) so the results are not optimal in my opinion. Impossible to see a real difference in the short term. Also, the format received did not highlight the product and was difficult to use. Anyway, the product is soft and leaves a comfortable and pleasant effect on the skin. It's not greasy for the skin and is rather light to wear during the day. The perfume it leaves on the skin is not unpleasant, but could bother some people. Having sensitive skin, I also would have preferred a less strong smell. Nevertheless, this product fits easily into a daily routine (especially if it is adopted in another format).

I've been using it during my morning routine, the texture is very light so it's ideal to use it during the day before a moisturizer and daily makeup. The formula is full of natural ingredients (curcuma, aloe vera, avocado, among other fruits and plants). It is ideal for all skin types, even sensitive, combination or oily skin because although it has an oily texture, the absorption is incredibly good and efficient. It is suitable even for men, because immediately after applying it, it is absorbed. I really liked the serum, the scent is not invasive and my skin is very radiant and hydrated.

I love mixing these 2 power house serums together in my palms and patting into my skin after cleansing and toning. I was anticipating a sticky oily feel, but my skin ate this serum up, and my face and neck have never felt so soft and smooth. I was planning on using double serum at night time, but the way my skin felt after application, I decided to use it the next morning as well, as my only skincare step. My skin feels hydrated all day long and has a beautiful soft glow when I apply the serum under my makeup. I only use a small dime sized amount, as it seems pretty concentrated. My sensitive skin was not irritated at all, even with the soft, clean fragrance inside. I can't say enough great things about the light texture version of Clairns double serum. Hands down one of my favorite skincare products of all time. Luckily, I was chosen to try a seven day sample as a free product and will definitely be purchasing  in the very near future."

The serum glides nicely when applying it to your face and neck areas. I have noticed a change in my skin and I love using the Serum.  It feels lovely applying it, my skin is much Softer and smoother where I was getting lines. I am starting to get signs of aging and I love that this Serum is fading them away.

Thankfully Clarins gifted me their Double Serum Light Texture complimentary for my honest opinion. ud83dudc9b  As this is my first Clarins product, I canu2019t compare it to the original. But I can say that I am really impressed with this anti-aging serum and its texture! Double Serum is Clarinsu2019 number one selling serum, but in a light texture. The new lightweight texture is ideal for oily skin and those living in warm or humid climates. ud83dudc9b  Living in Tennessee it gets pretty warm and humid, and this serum has been wonderful! Not only is it addressing my anti-aging needs, but it is super lightweight and perfect for all the rainy, humid weather we have been having! I have severely dry, dull, aging skin and this serum is literally transforming my skin. My skin is appearing more radiant, itu2019s super smooth and hydrated, my fine lines are less apparent and my skin is appearing firmer. ud83dudc9b  I really love how easily this absorbs into my skin, with zero stickiness or oiliness. I am shocked, I would have imagined this serum to leave my skin feeling oily, but it doesnu2019t. It has a light fragrance that I donu2019t mind, it actually smells delicious. It contains amazing ingredients like Turmeric, Mango, Kiwi, Beauty Berry, Oat, Cocoa, Banana and Quinoa. I love the way my skin feels and looks from adding this Clarins Double Serum in the new light texture into my daily routine. This is definitely a serum I would love to always have in hand! ud83dudc9b"

When I saw there was a light option I knew I needed to try it. I have normal/combo skin with dullness, texture, fine lines and enlarged pores. After trying this one I can say it's definitely the way to go for my skin type. It has a similar texture to the original but feels so much lighter on my skin. Rather than a cream in the mix this one has another very thin fluid that mixes very easily and sinks into my skin quickly. I didn't experience any breakouts with this one and I feel it's made my skin look more radiant. I had a bit of crepe-y skin under my eyes that has started to smooth out and my texture has improved as well. If you have finicky skin and need a lighter serum this is the way to go! I also love that you can dial in exactly how much you want it to dispense so that you're never getting too much or too little."

First impressions: smells WONDERFUL (not floral or fruity, but a fresh, pretty, subtle fragrance); the packaging is very pretty, high-end, and it looks really nice on my bathroom counter. I like that I can adjust how much product comes out in one pump (there are 2 settings- Iu2019ve found the larger amount is just right for my face and neck). I really like this serum; itu2019s very light, not greasy feeling, and just enough oil to act as my moisturizer in warm weather. During winter I would probably need additional moisture. It leaves me glowing and feeling like I donu2019t need makeup. I feel like it has also reduced some fine lines and smoothed out my skin. It feels really nice on, absorbs quickly, and has been a great addition to my skincare. My hair is up in the before picture; same time of day, same room, same lighting, and no makeup at all.

I have previously used the original Double Serum and can attest that this serum feels more lightweight than the original while still being incredibly hydrating and moisturizing. It has over 20 plant extracts that are supposed to improve skin's radiance and minimize the look of fine lines and wrinkles. I have tried this lightweight serum a few times and my skin looks more hydrated and glowy. It works well with my other skincare products. Like the original, the Double Serum Light does have a heavy dose of fragrance, but I still enjoy the overall benefits of this serum."

            "review_text": "Clarins' Double Serum has been around seemingly forever and has become a crowd favorite over the years. It's definitely one of the brand's most popular - if not THE most popular - product in their line. By and large, dermatologists seem to agree that it's a nice formula but nothing terribly out of the ordinary or necessarily unique but loyal fans staunchly stand by the fact that the Double Serum is practically a miracle worker for their skin. I tried the original version years ago and enjoyed it but didn't find that it had any notable long-term effects that made me feel the need to repurchase it.  This serum (which was gifted by the brand) is the lighter weight sister of the original version but I think that it feels every bit as delightful as what I tried years ago. I honestly do really enjoy how it feels on my skin and it absolutely provides the hydration that my dry skin appreciates. The packaging feels luxe and the product itself is conveniently dispensed through a pump top. The serum feels substantial without being cloyingly heavy and it somehow sinks into the skin but yet manages to still create almost a pillowy veil of moisture over the skin's surface. Clearly I really do like using this. However, despite all of its good qualities I still don't see any kind of lasting, long-term, anti-aging benefits from using this. The results, though delightful, are temporary and for the high price tag it may not be worth it to a lot of people.  Would I purchase it at a discounted price or during a sale? Possibly. However, for my myself I don't think I could justify purchasing it at its full retail value."

As someone with oily skin, I've struggled to find a serum that doesn't leave me feeling greasy, but this lightweight formula is perfect. In just a week, I noticed a visible improvement in my skin's firmness, hydration, and overall radiance. The serum goes on smoothly and is quickly absorbed, leaving behind no oily residue. I also appreciate the innovative dual-chamber bottle that preserves the potency of the 21 plant extracts, including Turmeric, which optimize the skin's vital functions. Overall, I highly recommend this serum to anyone looking for a powerful anti-aging solution that's perfect for oily or humid climates. Gifted by Clarins"
