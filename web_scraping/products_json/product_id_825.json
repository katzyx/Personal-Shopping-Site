I'm now on the third consecutive wash (they recommend 6 in the beginning) and am genuinely shocked at the results. My hair is silky soft, no more dry frizzy ends, and my wave pattern has been restored. I know the price is steep but I used to have one-time molecular mending treatments at the salon for more and the results weren't nearly as stunning. If this is in your budget, get it, it is MAGIC."

My hair feels like it’s had a protein overload. I’ve gone back to my normal products and my hair has not recovered.  Stupidly I then bought the K18 mist because I was told it’s more concentrated and will make my hair soft again.   Nope nope nope.  If your hair feels worse after the first use, do not continue using this hoping that it just needs time."

My hair is very long and pretty damaged from all the dying, pool and sun exposure. It's very hard to get it untangled even after a hair mask and a conditioner. With this mask, my hair is so shiny and soft, I couldn't believe my eyes. I made a mistake and used too much of the product for the first time, but still my hair had no residue, it just felt heavy. The best part is that I don't need to use a mask and a conditioner, just shampoo and then this leave-in mask, so my hair washing routine became so much shorter (I usually have to apply some other products after all washing routine anyway to style it). I am reordering in a big size, and will continue using as this is a life-saver for my hair."

I have naturally curly hair with grays coming in so I heat style it every day and use black box dye on a monthly basis and I have noticed such a difference with just two uses so far. It has made the ends of my hair more manageable and less dry and overall improved the softness of my hair. I also bought the mini bottle to test it out in case it didn't end up working for me but I will get the bigger size once I run out. Instructions also mention to not use conditioner but I have curly hair so I didn't want to sacrifice that step of my hair care routine so I wash with shampoo then towel dry my hair and use the k18 mask for 4 minutes and then I go in with conditioner. I also saw a tiktok of someone who had emailed K18 and they said it is ok to go in with conditioner after the four minutes have passed because that is the amount of time the product needs to actually work so after that you can use conditioner if needed."

I pair this with the K18 molecular repair oil to further help the appearance of my hair after styling. I deducted one star because unfortunately it doesn’t seem to actually repair hair in the long run."

But then I have improved my hair routine and I could achieve the same results with much cheaper products. What I did was use a hair mask instead of a conditioner in the shower and leaving for as long as I wash the rest of my body (which is what, 3 min?!). Then I ran out of the cheaper mask and tried using my leftover conditioner as a mask. And it worked the same. After the shower I use a leave on serum, not this, something much cheaper.  Also not going to sleep with wet hair makes a difference. So while K18 did work for me, I found that I don't need to commit to a $$$ product to have these results, so won't repurchase."

			"review_text": "In my opinion, K18 is better for bond building / treating damaged hair (especially bleached) than other brands. However, I don’t *really* believe the claim it’s made for all hair types. I have very fine,  high porosity bleached hair (full bleach —> base bump + highlights ) which is curly pattern mix of 3A/3B curls, and isn’t super thick.   My main issue is that 1-3 pumps is simply not enough for my hair. The directions state to use sparingly, but my curl pattern and porosity NEED much more product. Probably 4-6 pumps along with other leave in products. I’ve tried this leave in with both a sparingly conservative and generous amount of product alongside cutting out / normal routine of other post-shower products. I’ve adhered to using it 4-6 washes and then switching as needed, it’s just the same occurring issue.   If I were to use just 1-2 pumps of this leave in (recommended is just 2 dime size amounts) and no other products after showering, my hair is almost as dry as hay texture in a few hours out in a summer Midwest heat wave. The smoothness effect just doesn’t hold well; while the product does help in producing a more silky texture & appears to minimize the appearance of damage (flyaways / little hair pop ups / drying ends / hair ), that result goes away for me in probably less than 3-5ish hours.   I saw other reviews from people with curly / bleached hair that it appeared to work on; so this is just my experience. But I feel for the $$$ of the product, it’s an issue that I need to use such a heavy amount alongside various products to actually *see* results from it.   Just don’t think it’s worth the money if it’s potentially not able to adapt to various hair types! It definitely works for some people but it’s not a one size fits all."

This worked much better than Olaplex No. 3 at reducing and eventually stopping the breakage, and at creating a smoothing effect. I used it 6 wash days in a row to start, and now I'm using every other wash day for maintenance until the damage is grown out and cut off. I will probably still use it once a week or two beyond that whenever I have bleach in my hair. I wish it wasn't so expensive, but it definitely works."

My hair after 1 year still has a strange dry texture that I never had in my life. The hair that fell out is now growing in curly which is so bizarre as I have always had straight hair.  I had gorgeous blonde hair that was strong and healthy and I have not dyed my hair since for over a year as this product just destroyed, ruined, dried, left a weird film on it, and made it fall out."

I split my hair down the middle after clarifying shampoo and excess water has been squeezed out,  then scrunch up from the bottom and then focus on ends. Sometimes I will do a third pump to go over both sides. If you rub your hands together before applying, it becomes a better consistency to spread through your hair. I use my boar bristle wet hair brush to make sure product is spread throughout all my hair. My hair had breakage and this product has been amazing. I have less fly always, less breakage and my hair feels and look healthier. I use K18 mask 1x week. If my hair feels extra dry I will wait the 4 minutes and then apply a wash out hydrating conditioner as well.) All my regular hair products are applied after the k18 4 min wait.  The difference in my hair after using K18 has been significant."

Make sure all of your hair is coated with the product, wait 4 minutes (I waited 6-7) then you can get back in the shower to condition and get out and put all your normal products in.

So much so that this is my 2nd purchase of it. I like that it heals inside and out unlike Olaplex (no class action suits either). A lot people complain about the amount, the product amount is on the bottle, there’s no “deception” and I personally prefer an air pressure pump instead of a straw. Straws are so cheap. WHEN USED AS INSTRUCTED you really don’t need much. A little goes a long way. The price is kind of steep but worth it. I had to have 8 inches cut off of my hair previously because of damage.

I was skeptical on two fronts:  whether it would actually do anything and the small amount of product it says to use.  I was amazed on both fronts.  It actually does work and you really don't need much.  I have a HUGE amount of very curly, long, thick hair and started out with 3-4 pumps.  I used praying hands to distribute it over my hair and then squish to condish to get it distributed throughout my hair.  I could then rake it through easily and would add 1-2 more pumps if there were spots that would not slip.  My hair was very dried out and damaged, ironically, from using Innersense Organic Hydrating Cream Hairbath shampoo and their two conditioners.  I would definitely recommend this product for damaged, thick curly hair."

I simply cannot get the k18 properly into all areas of my hair because of this. I would literally have to use half the bottle to properly coat my clarified, unconditioned hair. I gave up when I realized I was probably causing more damage by attempting to semi detangle my rats nest with a comb so I can properly distribute the product.

Since I started using k18 regularly the texture of my hair has completely changed. It’s softer, the ends look thicker, and areas where I used to have chronic breakage are actually growing back. Cannot recommend enough.  One caveat: how you apply it is so important! The first time I used it, my hair was too wet, and it didn’t really do anything. It just sat on top of my hair and made it crunchy. BUT, if you wait until your hair is partially dry and rub the product vigorously between your palms before applying, it will make a huge difference. I also only use it after shampooing—no conditioner. I sometimes use a leave in conditioner/detangler after the 4 minutes are up, but it’s not absolutely necessary."

My hair seemed to drink it up (without any grease or piecey repercussions). Every subsequent time I've used 4-5 pumps. I want to believe it's doing something, and it very well might be... but I honestly can't notice a difference. My hair seems to have the same softness, shine, tensile strength, and propensity for shedding as before. It honestly wasn't enough to make me reach for another bottle, especially at the price point.

I apply that to my hair and then continue to do the same with the top section. I let that sit for at least 4 minutes before brushing my hair. After the wait I brush and style my hair and I swear my split ends have mended or something, there's some magic going on. It's wild! Use it 6 times in a row (after washes) and then only once a week. The instructions should be better, that's for sure, because when I first bought this mask I hated and never used it until I saw a video of someone using it how I described to you and it actually worked. If you already bought it and didn't like it, please try it again this way. If you haven't bought it yet, you should. I had so many split ends because I overuse styling tools.

Personally, I wash my hair 2 to 3 times a week, and using 2 pumps of the product is sufficient. It typically lasts me around 3 months before I need to replenish it.  Pro tip: Make sure to follow the instructions as it won't work effectively otherwise.

I personally found it very conditioning, and did not feel the need to hop back in the shower to condition after the 4 minute processing time. Im pleased because this will save me using up my conditioning products and time on the wash days when I use the k18 mask. I did use a leave in conditioner / heat protectant as usual after the processing time was up, and then blowdried. I can tell even after one use that my hair at the ends is less damaged, usually I get snags at the last few inches of my hair. My hair feels softer than ever.

I’m bummed I didn’t take before and after pictures.   K18 works amazingly. You hair will just feel like hair, which I love because it’s actually repairing rather than slapping a silky-feeling product on top that will just wash out later (which, let’s be honest, is all you get from most products). I highly recommend it!  TL;DR: Seriously thick, straight hair saw great results after 4 uses, and the mini holds a ton of product.   Results:  After 2 uses - hair looks more vibrant but still feels damaged  After 4 uses - hair is improved probably 80%"

			"review_text": "I purchased the larger size online right about the time K18 started getting a lot of buzz. It worked well and I noticed a positive difference even though the shampoo only rule was a tough one to follow. Also, with that first bottle I did what I always do and that was to put way too much product in my hair every time I used it. Despite this, that first bottle of K18 lasted forever! I was definitely surprised and pleased when it continued to pump for multiple uses past the first six shampoos.    Flash forward to when I finally finished the mask. I drove to Sephora and decided to splurge on a second bottle for my birthday. We all know that this mask is expensive and I wanted this bottle to last even longer than the first. I mean, It should last longer because I wouldn't need to use it as often, right? I didn't over do it with the second bottle and only put the reccomended amount on the ends of my hair once every couple of weeks.  Unfortunately, this bottle was empty after a 1/2 pump on my forth use!?! That's NOT an exaggeration and I tried thinking of reasons why I might have convinced myself that the first bottle lasted longer. I'm not infallible, but it doesn't make sense. I know how much I used and even had a significant hair cut right before the second bottle I purchased. Now, I just feel cheated and there's nothing I can do about it.  Anyway, all this just to say that I'm going to stick with using Olaplex. The K18 mask did work well, but it's ridiculously overpriced and the results weren't drastic. Plus, I'm still bitter about that 2nd purchase and I think that everyone should only buy this product when/if it's on sale."

I had met someone in the beauty business and she suggested K18. From the first time I tried it, I saw a difference. And all you do is shampoo, towel dry,  and then leave in 4 minutes before combing through your hair. You are not supposed to use any conditioner after shampooing. After 4 minutes you can use styling products. It’s expensive, but worth it."

Highly recommend rubbing the product in your hand until it turns white so you get more coverage without wasting the liquid gold. You can use any kind of leave in conditioner or other styling products after 4 minutes - if you don’t wait it won’t work. Also this is a product that builds on itself. That’s why you do a treatment for 6 washes then as needed. Hate it’s so expensive because it works so good. Bleached and dyed girly pops you NEED. If you don’t believe it works, leave a piece of hair out of the way then feel the difference once dry ;)"

I have to say YES, immediately using it will make your hair feel soft & all....

ALSO nothing GETS RID of split ends/breakage ASIDE from cutting ✂️ it off....  BUT as I have to get root touch ups every 8 weeks or so, I WILL SAY this HAS NOTICEABLY made my hair STRONGER, where It doesn't shed as much, or break as easily , & TRULY works.... I do recommend K18 to ANYONE.. BUT THIS IS A **MUST HAVE** IF you bleach your hair & go blonde. It's just MUST especially for high lift blondes, BELIEVE ME it's worth it.... A little goes a long way, & after applying, waiting 4 mins & incorporating whatever other leave ins you use, is truly amazing..... I used this product 4 washes in a row.

My hair felt lank, gummy and just looked greasy and horrible - I was so frustrated that I had to wash and dry my hair all over again, and it felt even drier than before for weeks. I did some research and turns out there is completely different advice on the brand's website, which is so strange, but decided to give it another go. I skipped conditioner, used 2.5 pumps for my long balayage-blonde hair, vigorously rubbed my hands together until the product felt thicker and resembled white paint, smoothed through all my bleached areas, left at least 4 minutes, then continued with the rest of my usual hair routine. After drying my hair it felt super-soft, hydrated and so much better than before - such a contrast to the gross gummy feel it gave my hair before. I don't use it every wash, only as needed. Minus one star since it's so expensive and the packaging could be better."

I wash it and use heat about two times a week.  - I've gone through a few bottles of K18 over two years and currently only use it once or twice a month. - I used to follow the directions exactly, but found I got better results with the following: I wash my hair thoroughly, then dry my hair so it's not sopping. I put K18 in my hair and let it sit for the 4 minutes, then I put a hair mask on top of it. After the mask has sat for the necessary time, I rinse it out and move on with styling products. (Youtuber Abbey Yung contacted the company and they confirmed this is fine to do).  The review: So I don't think I've really seen much of a difference in my hair regarding the look and feel. However, I do feel like my hair can handle a lot more to it now. I still have breakage, but not as much as I used to have considering how damaging my routine is. It also took a long time for me to really notice this. A lot of people said after the first 6 uses, they noticed a huge difference but I honestly don't think I noticed much of a difference till well into my second bottle.  I also HATE the packaging. I don't usually care about packaging, but there is no way to tell how much product you have left right now. For $100, I'd like to at least know when I'm close to running out.  Also I'm certain this product used to be like $80 or $90CAD tops. I know the science is different, but I've definitely had more noticeable results from cheaper products out there (surprisingly, L'oreal's Acidic PH Hair Treatment has become my favourite).  TLDR: - It made my hair feel stronger, but isn't a miracle and took a long time to see results - Packaging sucks - Increasing the price with no improvement to the product also sucks"

I cut off about 8 inches of hair and even then the chop did not cut off all the fragile ends but I also couldn't go any shorter unless I wanted a pixie. So I started using the k18 hoping it would help keep my hair from breaking any further while I went between cuts in my attempt to fix my hair situation. It soon became essential to my hair routine. I've had 1 cut since the big one and the K18 has kept any more of my hair from breaking off in between (which also included more heat styling than normal because I was in 2 weddings during this time). Since the second cut, I've continued using the mask as some of the damaged strands haven't grown long enough to be cut and k18 is really helping keep my hair from looking dry and damaged. It's soft and manageable and has really rescued my hair from whatever mysterious thing happened to it this year."

I did my research before I purchased it so that I would know the correct way to apply the product not the social media/video hype reviewed way or by just reading the bottle. Because I have hard water prior to using K18 I prepped my hair by using Malibu C shampoo first to remove product build up and then the Color Prepare before I went to the salon for my monthly color. Then when I came home and washed my hair, no conditioner, then applied 2 pumps of K18 to my palms and rubbed them together vigorously. This must be done first. Do not apply to hair before you rub product together in your palms first.Then applied to hair and let sit for 4 minutes. Applied my creme and styled. I repeated for 6 days/washes straight then applied K18 again after my next color. My colorist says my hair has never felt better and I agree. I believe using Malibu C to remove product build up and then Color prepare has not only made my hair dry faster but then K18 has made my hair feel soft and fabulous with less flyaways."

			"review_text": "This product worked very well for me over the 4-5 months I’ve been using it. I have medium to fine curly that has never been coloured but it did have a lot of heat damage from many years of straightening(split and breaking/brittle ends and strands). Before using this I had already been getting regular haircuts plus trimming any split ends I would see on a weekly basis and using heat protectant but still found my hair to always become very damaged again so quickly, therefore it never grew. I found the K18 mask, in combination with other things I’ve already been doing like reducing the temperature a bit when I use hot tools, wearing less damaging hair styles and the trimming of split ends regularly has really overhauled the health of my hair. My hair seems to be legitimately healthy now and is FINALLY growing without becoming so broken at the ends that I just need to chop it off again when I get some length, the strands are actually stronger and shinier.  Because I have curly hair prone to dryness I thought I should mention that the way I use this is different than the instructions. I use a clarifying shampoo in the shower then get out and towel dry my hair so it’s damp, then I use K18 the way it says for 4 mins then hop back in the shower rinse it out and condition as normal. I absolutely need to condition my hair after using this or I would get damage just from my hair being too dry and I wouldn’t get any of the benefits from the product. I also only use it about once or twice a month now as opposed to the 6 consecutive washes I did at the beginning with it as instructed.  The reason I gave this 4 stars is because of the price and the size, it’s so small for how much you pay and the price also went up by over 10$ since June 2023 when I first ordered(it was $89 CAD then and now in November is just over $100.. it’s kind of ridiculous, they could’ve at least increased the amount of product you get if they’re going to raise the price by that much."

I’m never rolling into a Sally’s again (💀) but basically I did a really bad at-home bleach job, some color then some color remover, then color again- I might have even did another bleach job- this was a year ago. I had decently healthy hair before all of this- but it was destroyed. I used the aphogee protein treatments which helped a bit but didn’t want to overdo it. I tried a lot of hydrators that didn’t even help camouflage it. I’ve ‘Ve never had noticeable results with olaplex in the past so I didn’t bother. I used this as directed, although I was frustrated trying to work it through my “shampoo only” wet strands. After an hour or so, I looked in the mirror, and I was in total disbelief at how major the transformation was! I followed up with it for a few weeks and was so so thankful with how my hair was saved. That along w the Amika overnight hydrator and the olaplex oil ( I do love that) I’m so happy with my hair. I’ve had some trims since then and highlights and I’m back to my old head of hair. I can still tell where the old damaged hair is bcos it still looks a bit porous to me- but not in a way that anyone but myself can tell. Very few products deliver on what they say imo, this product had me in disbelief. I will always buy even while my hair is healthy, just for maintenance when I get highlights, and halfway through to my next appointment. The results are more subtle bcos my hair isn’t as damaged, but my split ends are more smoothed, I can go longer without a haircut, and overall my hair looks and IS more healthy bcos of this product."

I listened to a podcast created by beauty chemists that make hair products and they said that this line has the same main ingredient that Olaplex has. So if k18 is saying they’re better, they really aren’t they’re the same. I mean quart does this product even do?! Yes I followed all the steps in specific sequence as I went to a training for this like specifically. I much rather use a few other hair care lines I can think of.

When you're out of the shower, put the K18 Biomimetic Hairscience Leave-in Molecular Repair Hair Mask on your damp hair. Wait four minutes. Then style as usual.  The pump on the mask is nice.  Product doesnt have a crazy amount of fragrance but the scent is pleasant. Clean.  Loved that this is perfect for a wash and go.  Because the shampoo stripped my hair I was very worried the mask wouldn't be enough.  And at first I really thought it wouldn't be. But let me tell you I saw results on just the first use. My hair was hydrated immediately. My already existing  hair also felt thicker by the next wash and was easier to handle. This means the repairing worked even after just one use."

It’s important to note that it does take 3 full treatments to see and feel a difference, and that you should not use conditioner before the mask. Honestly, I swear my k18 for a treatment mask that is better than anything I’ve tried. It’s not just a superficial softness, but it really does something internally to the hair. My hair just looks healthier, bouncier, and shinier with 3 treatments!"

I only wash my hair once a week as a curly girl so I've only been able to try this 2x so far. I am impressed though. I was extremely worried about not being able to use conditioner as my hair tangles easily and is dry. It was not a huge problem though. The detox shampoo did not strip my hair of moisture. The K18 leave in left my hair moisturized, soft, and shiny. The smell is light and pleasant, and the product is light. It did not weigh my curls down. I did have to adjust the amount of curl products I used on the second wash though because I did not get as much hold using K18 with my normal amount of gel.  I really do feel like this works to repair my heat and chemically damaged hair. I don't like the price tag but if it continues to repair my hair it is worth it."

They’ve gifted me both their k18 biomimetic leave in conditioner and their Peptide Shampoo which helps repair split ends, helps condition and repair brittle hair using molecular bond repair science in their formulation. I bleach my hair alot but with the help of bond repair hair care products I pretty much never have to cut my hair unless I really want to shape it as I don’t have any split ends. This leave in conditioner makes my hair so much smoother. I shampooed my hair with the peptide shampoo which helps to strengthen the keratin in my hair and then applied the leave in conditioner and waited 4 mins then proceeded to blow dry my hair.

I rubbed one pump between my hands until it thickened up and turned while, and distributed it throughout my hair. I used a wide-toothed comb to comb it through, and I was pleasantly surprised that my hair quickly untangled as I combed the product through. The directions indicate that you need to wait 4 minutes before you apply any additional product to your hair.

I'm very conflicted on this product for many reasons,  although I will admit that it has improved the appearance of my hair and it does appear smoother, which I noticed even after the first use. My typical hair routine consists of a hard water shampoo, purple shampoo and a purple toning/hydration mask. Having well water at home really affects my color so the hardwater shampoo and purple products really keep my color looking fresh.  This hair repair mask instructs to not condition before applying, which means skipping out on my purple toning hair mask.  No conditioner upon leaving the shower also resulted in my hair looking a total rats nest. I couldn't get a comb (or even get my fingers) through it. After applying the product (I used 2 pumps to start) and letting it sit, I was able to comb through it, although I still felt like I was ripping my hair out. After the first comb through,  I then applied 2 more pumps before I felt it was where it needed to be. I first noticed the improvement in the amount of damage immediately after drying my hair.  It appeared smoother and I had less fly aways. I also liked that my hair still felt light and not weighed down by product. A negative for me was that my hair seemed to not hold style as well as before and there is absolutely no scent at all to this product. Having hardwater at home leaves a metallic scent and usually my shampoo and conditioner help to dampen the scent but with this product not being scented, my hair just smells of heavy metals. Overall, I really thought this product was effective and did reduce the amount of damage in my hair, although most likely I will use every other wash in order to continue using my blonde toning mask on the other days."

Even after the first couple uses, my hair was instantly more manageable and easier to heat style. Bonus that it was overall softer, smoother, and shinier.   I have long, thick hair and I used the max suggested amount of 3 pumps for my hair. Add it one pump at a time, mix throughout, and trust the process. It is important to note that you absolutely should use your regular products after the 4 min mask time. If used alone, you won’t get the same results. Use it right, and your hair will thank you! I absolutely recommend this product, and the peptide prep too."

I was skeptical at first that this mask would make a visible different in a short amount of time, but in only a few applications I can already see a huge improvement in how my hair looks and feels. It's got a healthier, more vibrant appearance and looks and feels softer, shinier and much smoother even my dry ends appear revitalized and renewed. I would definitely recommend to anyone with damaged hair looking to improve the health and appearance of their hair quickly."

After 3 to 5 minutes after getting after the application I can run a brush right thru my hair as long as I start from the bottom. I do use a little leave in conditioner later because of my curly hair to help with keeping it from becoming frizzy but if your hair is straight I'd say nothing else left to do but style as usual."

This is a cruelty  free, vegan and recyclable  packaging  product. This is a leave in molecular repair hair mask that is very easy to use after you shampoo  your hair you apply this product  to damp hair do no rinse it it out. You start off with one pump and little bit of one pump goes alot away and you build up the pumps from there and the amount that is at max is 3 pumps. This is a 50 ml  bottle this is alot of pumps and  you only need to use the product  1- 2 times a week when you first start using it. Then only as needed after  4-6 hair washes. This product  has long lasting results too. The first time I used it my hair was soft and smooths for days it was so full of life and very bouncy. This product says that only takes 4 minutes  to see results and I say this is true in fact I notice myself that the results of my hair was noticeable within that 4 mins of applying the product. This leave in hair mask has  help my hair so much in less then 2 weeks time frame and my hair was damaged  due to bleaching and dying my hair over the years also using hot tools doesn't help the damaged  either. However using this product has help my damaged  hair that it looks like it was never really damaged  before. This my new favorite  product  and a holy grail item for sure. The best part is the product life is 12 months. This is a 5 star product."

Overall, I understand the hype behind the product and have been enjoying it so far."

As advised did not use conditioner and after a towel dry used the mask allover. I have shoulder length hair so I used 2 and half pumps, started with 1 full pump. The leave on mask seems greasy as I applied it, however my hair did not turn oily but more conditioned, manageable and bouncy. This is remarkable to see my hair being nourished and bounce with health. I am really blown away that with just one wash and application my hair turned rough to nourished.

			"review_text": "I recently purchased the Leave-In Repair Hair Mask that came as part of a set with the shampoo, and I must say, I am extremely impressed with the results. This duo has completely transformed the health and appearance of my hair.  Firstly, the shampoo is fantastic. It cleanses my hair thoroughly without stripping it of its natural oils. It lathers well and has a pleasant scent that lingers in my hair throughout the day. I also noticed that my hair feels softer and more manageable after using this shampoo.  The real star of the show, however, is the Leave-In Repair Hair Mask. This product is a game-changer for my hair. It is incredibly nourishing and has helped to repair and strengthen my damaged strands. I apply a small amount to my damp hair after washing, and it instantly detangles and smooths out any knots or frizz. It also adds a beautiful shine to my hair, making it look healthy and vibrant.  What I love most about this hair mask is that it is lightweight and doesn't weigh down my hair. It absorbs quickly and doesn't leave any residue or greasiness behind. I can feel the difference in the texture of my hair after using this mask - it feels softer, silkier, and more manageable.  I also appreciate that this mask provides long-lasting benefits. Even after several washes, my hair continues to feel nourished and repaired. It has helped to reduce breakage and split ends, and my hair looks and feels much healthier overall.  Overall, I highly recommend the Leave-In Repair Hair Mask that comes with the shampoo. This duo is a winning combination that has transformed my hair from dull and damaged to healthy and vibrant. If you're looking for a hair care set that delivers visible results, give this one a try. You won't be disappointed."

			"review_text": "I have fine, blonde, hair that has been highlighted for 20+ years. That being said, my hair always looks nicer when I have used a heavy conditioner. So to switch to this was - a wild concept. I have used all the high end products in the past but nothing really repaired breakage or prevented it.  I needed something to repair my fragile hair. As of late, my hair has been just breaking off, leading to frizzy hair, with tons of broken bits at the crown of my head. Probably a previous product made it more fragile, plus age - oh yay. For years, I have noticed tons of hair fallout in the shower. Like TONS. Then there are the hairs in all my drawers, on the floor, in my Roomba, in my hands after just a simple swipe. I could create a whole wig line with the fallout and breakage.  I can look at my hair with side eye and it falls out. You get the point. So I was willing to try this even tho it has protein (blonde hair sometimes hates protein) and I was really surprised. It was weird to shampoo then get out of the shower like a drown rat. I followed the instructions precisely and have used it about 4x now. Although my hair does not look transformed - it is soft and manageable. However, I have noticed at least 80-90% less breakage. No more massive hair clumps in the shower, comb, hands or on the floor of my apt. I am impressed to say the least. Never thought I could live without conditioner, yet here we are. Satisfied customer regrowing hair breakage."

I was sent this K18 Biomimetic Hairscience Leave-In Molecular Repair Hair Mask from K18 and I couldn’t wait to use it! I love that K18 also sent me their Peptide Prep Detox Shampoo! I already owned the Molecular Repair Hair Oil so I was able to use the whole system and the results were amazing! 🧡  K18 Biomimetic Hairscience Leave-In Molecular Repair Hair Mask is a 4 minute leave-in treatment to reverse hair damage. It helps repair damage caused by bleach or color, chemical services and heat. It delivers immediate and long lasting results, ongoing reparative benefits. Use of this hair mask and its K18Peptides help to restore strength, softness, smoothness and bounce to hair. 🧡  I was already a fan of K18 from trying their Molecular Repair Hair Oil, I decided to give this a go as soon as it came in the mail. I started by washing my hair with the Peptide Prep which did an amazing job clarifying my hair and scalp. Made sure to not use any conditioner per the directions, then towel tried my hair some, and followed up with 4 pumps of the leave in, and for each side, I ended up adding two more, one for each side. I worked it through my hair ends to roots, left on on for the 4 minutes, brushed through and heat styled with my blowout brush. 🧡  Before blowing out, I added two drops of the hair oil to the ends of my hair to take any fly aways and help protect my hair during hair styling, as it contains heat protection up to 450 degrees. Once my hair was fully blown out, it was so soft, silky, smooth and bouncy! I am definitely impressed and so grateful to have been given the opportunity for try this product and now the whole starter set. K18 works amazing with my hair type and I will continue to use their products and try any new products as they come out! 🧡"

I can just shampoo my hair and then head out of the shower. I have really long hair (almost bottom of back) so I'm scared to put in too much of the concentrated formula but it's pretty easy to work it. I haven't noticed anything detrimental if I AM putting in too much of the mask. I find that I still want to use a hair oil or leave in product after the mask is completely in my hair for extra softness. This mask WILL give you results, but you have to use it consistently at first to see. I think it's really pricey for what it does though... you could get away with using hair masks in the shower."

I ended up buying the shampoo repair mask and oil. And let me tell you in two days of just using this product its mind blowing the blatant dryness just disappeared like I said Magic in a bottle. You get what you pay for. It pricey but it worked so I'm glad I invested in my hair. I would recommend.

I use pre-wash and/or detox shampoo once a week, after I use the mask on towel dried hair and oil after 4-5 minutes. I always get compliments on how shiny and healthy looking my hair is. I remember it was very unusual to not use conditioner at first and I had overused the mask, but I started using it right on the third or forth time )) and now I’m Pro, lol.

			"review_text": "Last started saying that my hair was begging for help. I have bleached platinum blonde hair that is also naturally straight so my hair is always in major need of shaft repair. No punches pulled here: The K18 Mask is the most effective hair mask I've ever used, and I've cycled through a lot of treatments over the years. The first time I used it, I was not impressed, though—which is why the instructions explain to use it six times consecutively before dropping down to every three or four washes for maintenance. Around the third application, you notice the biggest difference in touchability. The mask quickly absorbs into your hair with minimal residue and is very lightweight. My hair felt immediately softer and silkier after even one use; as it dried, my hair felt thicker, too. I was worried it was going to make my hair greasy, but it didn’t at all. It almost feels like vitamins for my hair—I can see it strengthening and repairing, too. The peptide technology of K18 is unlike any other hair product I have. The investment in this mask is absolutely worth it. Plus, it doubles as a leave-in conditioner, hair gel and cream all in one without needing to layer on extra products. Whether you have straight, curly, wavy hair—or a mix of the three—K18 is for every hair type with more heat and color damage than they care to admit. Personally, I think the K18 hair mask is a genius product. It’s efficient and effective, and my colour and heat-damaged low-porosity hair drank it up Gifted by K18 Biomimetic Hairscience"

It's clinically proven to repair damage from bleach, color treatments, chemical services, and heat. After using it, I noticed immediate and lasting results. My hair felt stronger, softer, smoother, and had a noticeable bounce to it.  What I love most about this product is its convenience. You can apply it to damp hair, leave it on for a few minutes, and go about your routine. No need to rinse it out. Plus, the fact that it addresses damage at the molecular level is quite impressive.  I've been using the K18 Leave-In Mask regularly, and it has become a staple in my hair care routine. If you're looking to revive and restore your hair's health, I highly recommend giving this product a try. It's worth every penny for the incredible results it delivers."

Then when you apply your hair will get smooth and less frizzy. I know it can’t work for everyone but I swear it helps soooo much if you use as directed. I have told my friends it’s a miracle worker for postpartum hair problems. I stand by that and I’m super happy I now have some complimentary to replace my next bottle. Thank you k18!"

And my hair needed it. Split ends like crazy. Damage from hot tools. Dull and dry. It just didn't look or feel good. So I followed the instructions to a T. I used a clarifying shampoo. You wanna get the oils outta your hair. No conditioner. Towel dried my hair. And added about 3 pumps to my shoulder length hair. Left it in for 4 minutes before adding my heat protectant/styling spray . Then I blow dried it. Immediately after use I noticed my hair was less frizzy than normal. I noticed how much better my hair felt and looked after use. Looked brighter and felt softer. After continued use, I have had much less breakage. My hair feels way less brittle than before. Way less frizz and fly aways. More bounce in my hair. It just looks and feels better over all. I now swear by this stuff and will tell anyone who will listen. Make sure you follow the steps correctly though and thing thats why some people have issues with it. Would highly recommend. Definitely worth the price."

The improvements were most noticible on the areas with the medium to low amount of damage. My most damaged parts (bang areas) was looking almost the same as before i started using the product. So it will definitely not give life to the hair that was extremely damaged. I would recommend this product to anyone, just don't expect magic cuz we aren't there yet :)"

The only downside is application -- I love my conditioner and in-shower masks, but cannot use them with K18. If I do try to rebel my hair does not look as good as it does sans-conditioner. Oh well. I do also have naturally very oily roots (but dry ends) and instead of exacerbating it, the mask has actually helped reduce oiliness -- I don't know if it was supposed to, LOL -- and has made my interval between hair washes once every four days instead of every alternate day. Saves my blowdryer a lot of work. I can go a long time without brushing it all out, and my hair fall has lessened too. I highly recommend K18 to anyone with a similar hair type.  (My hair is really thick and hits just below my waistline; very long, and has a natural wave pattern -- which I blow-dry straight with a bevel using the Dyson everytime I wash. I do generally take very good care of my hair; heat protectants, various treatments, all-around meticulous care, so this is just another step in my already very extravagant routine.)"

You need to first do 1 pump (or 2 if you’ve thick long hair like mine) and rub your hands together as fast as you can for 20 secs until it turns white opaque in your palms. Then spread it evenly mainly on the ends and brush with your finger. The label says to wait 4 mins for it to activate— and although it still works when styling my hair right after the 4 mins mark I find that leaving it for longer gives better results.   To be fair, I’m really horrible at blowouts using my Revlon air brush and so it doesn’t look as good as when I come out of the salon, but it’s still amazing. So for all the people out there who are talented at styling their hair this mask will get you looking like Cindy Crawford!"

			"review_text": "Wow.. just wow. I’ve used this product before on virgin hair before I started the series of changing my color every other week and even then I got phenomenal results. At that time, I was always applying heat to my hair. I probably wore my hair flat-ironed more than I wore it in my what I thought natural 3b-3c curls. Because of that, my hair would frequently have split-ends and never really grow past a certain point.  It was when I used the k18, my curls were unbelievably healthy, my hair pattern was all 3c curls/corkscrews and had this unimaginable shine and bounce. From there I maintained the health of my hair and wore it natural more, it began retaining length and shining. Fast forward a year or two later, I bought this product once again. This is because this year, I decided to experiment more with bleach and color. I kept going back and forth between reds and black and ginger hair dyes. I used color oops like four times and bleached it twice. My hair eventually began to pay the price. I felt like an idiot for tampering with my hair so much as the damage it had done to my hair was clear. My curls were loose, like 3a and even in some parts 2c. I thought I was going to have to cut it off. It was breaking and stretching like hair should not. I nearly cried my eyes out until I remembered k18. I thought it wouldn’t hurt to try it again, and boy… on my first use, I notice results. When I combed through my hair, it was no longer stretching and breaking off horrendously. The elasticity was definitely improved. Even when wet, I noticed my hair starting to curl with no manipulation. When it dried, it looked so much better than before. But on day 2 and 3 is when I noticed a real difference. My hair actually looked like what it did BEFORE my color journey. On my first use! Absolutely insane. I can’t wait to finish this bottle, it’s only going to get better from here. And YES, you can use conditioner. Just waist the 4 full minutes after the treatment. You need conditioner!!"

I am not sure if k18 resolved the hair I had left to feel less like straw. I used 6 consecutive washes, and then 1 time a week - 3 weeks following: so 3 more times. I did notice which I have never had in my life while and after using that I was shedding from scalp with the follicle bulb. All the hair shedding during and after use of k18 had a follicle bulb? I am not sure what is in this stuff : some say  there is keratin and then others say it's a peptide. It is unclear. When I would wash normal (daily) after a couple of days from using the k18 - my hair would stop shedding from the root/ follicle bulb. I will shelf this for now.

The directions tell you to use no conditioner, and spread 3 pumps (1mL) throughout clean towel dried hair, then brush. HUGE red flag. I basically tore my hair out in chunks even when gently brushing. 1 mL was a joke, and I used 2 mL to evenly distribute. My hair was super dry near the root with insane fly away breakage pieces. My ends however, were soft to the touch, but still looked dehydrated. I saw the potential but I had mixed feelings.  After experiencing that with the small sample tube, I bought the mini to do a test with the Olaplex bonding treatment. THAT changed my hair drastically! It was shiny, strong, soft, and less frizzy. When wet, I was able to actually brush with minimal breakage after two applications. Both in conjunction were holy grail, and I highly recommend anyone experiencing what I did, to try it with Olaplex. I wash my hair every 2-3 days with the k18 Peptide Prep pH, and I incorporated Verb Ghost Oil/Moroccan oil. Hope this helps for anyone who is on the fence about K18!!"

Wash hair twice or with a clarifying shampoo 2. Get out of the shower and towel dry your hair 3. Part hair in half, pump K18 into palm, and rub your hands together so the product on your hands turn white. Then I scrunch and rub it into my hair 1 side at a time. My hair is long so I do about 1 pump per side, then I flip my head upside down and do a half pump for the bottom half. 4. Wait the 4 minutes before hopping back into the shower. You're free to now rinse out the product and go about your conditioning routine :)   I find this method maintains the integrity of the product's results, and also keeps your hair conditioned, as it seems a common complaint made about K18 is how dry people's hair feels after."

This has made my hair feel softer, lighter, stronger, I have less breakage & my hair did not feel as dry after heat usage. But this didn't magically transform my hair; I still have some split ends and frizz, but my hair overall feels better. This is the routine I used for every K18 wash for 6 washes: 1.) No pre-shampoo oil treatment (usually I use one before every wash). 2.) Use a clarifying shampoo before K18. I used Ouai Detox Shampoo. You need to get all of the oils & other build up off your hair before putting K18 on so there's nothing blocking the K18 from penetrating your hair. DO NOT CONDITION BEFORE K18. 3.) After shampoo, I got out of the shower and I towel dried my hair with a micro-fiber towel, so my hair was still damp, but not dripping wet. 4.) I separated my hair into two sections, then used two pumps for each section (4 pumps total). I pumped 2 pumps on my hand, rubbed my hands together for 30 seconds until the K18 turned white and had an oily texture, then scrunched into one section of my hair from the bottom to the roots to ensure it was evenly applied. You do NOT want to use too much K18, this isn't a deep conditioning treatment. You just want it to make contact with your hair, not coat it. I couldn't see the K18 on my hair after I applied it. 5.) Set your timer for 4 minutes. 6.) after the 4 minutes were up, I did NOT rinse out the K18 and I put on my regular Aveda deep-moisture conditioner on directly over it. K18 has now officially come out and said you can use conditioner AFTER the 4 minute period & rinse out the conditioner as you usually would without affecting the K18. Then I continued to use my normal styling products as directed. I believe the issues people are having are due to using K18 on too wet hair, using too much K18, not dispersing it throughout the hair, & not using conditioner after use."

I have thick course hair to begin with and I bought the 75$ bottle. It’s so small! I can’t belive that 1.7 is the full size. I have thick hair so one pump isn’t gonna do it. Especially since it said to not condition afterward. I did exactly what the instructions told me to do. I even looked on line to make sure I was doing it right. My hair was far from repaired. It infact looked worse more dry and brittle since I didn’t use conditioner afterward. It also felt so heavy and tacky. Like if you were to leave regular conditioner over night. It felt horrible in my hair. I emulsified it in my palms before hand to just to make sure. My hair has never felt or looked worse the damage has not gone away and I just wasted 75$ for the smallest amount of hair product. Even if this was was cheap I wouldn’t buy it. Awful for the hair I don’t know who’s getting good results with this and I’ve tried this a couple of times. It doesn’t work as advertised and now I wish I spent my money on something else. :("

			"review_text": "I am very conflicted about this mask. I have extremely dry and damaged hair after years of coloring, heat styling and most of bleaching. It's left my hair feeling like horsehair so I'm always trying to find the perfect hair product to combat the dryness and damage and when I tried using this for the first time I was absolutely blown away by what it did to my hair! For the first time my hair was actually soft and shiny and manageable and I was so happy about that! I've been using it rather religiously since then, I've used it a few times in a row now 'cause they said to do that for very damaged hair the first 6-8 times and it was supposed to fix it. I don't think I've seen any long term change or anything but my hair feels pretty good for the first couple of days and looks beautiful after I've straightened it. But the reason I say I'm conflicted and the reason it only gets 3 stars is because of the ingredients! There's an ingredient that's almost the first one on the list that I am shocked they would not only put in the product to begin with but also put so much of it that it dominates over most other ingredients, and that is denatured alcohol! This is the most drying ingredient you could ever find for both your hair and skin and no one should be using it. I don't buy ANYTHING that has to do with makeup, skincare or haircare that contains it (I didn't buy this myself btw) because using this ingredient in anything that touches your skin is going to dry it out to the point that you'll be looking like an old leather bag by the time you're 40! It's the ingredient that's in the popular UD All Nighter spray for example. Crazy that more people don't know this fact! So I wouldn't get this mask again as I don't want it drying and damaging my hair and skin for an extended period of time. It's insane that they'd put the most drying ingredient out there in this mask and then claim it's supposed to help with dryness! This mask will eventually ruin your hair, that's a fact."

I absolutely cannot skip conditioner my hair tangles very easily. Once out of the shower I’ll towel dry, apply a light spray leave-in conditioner and follow it up with the k18 hair oil while my hair is still damp. (Hair must be damp to get the repairing qualities of the k18  hair oil). My hair feels and looks so much healthier! I highly recommend this, but don’t pay full price. Wait until Sephora has a sale.

I used it 5 washes in a row in place of my normal conditioner 2.  hand-squeezed as much water as possible from my hair (did not towel dry, as my hair drys extremely fast) 3. immediately massaged it into my hair   4. I left the product on for 4 minutes 5. applied my normal styling products.    At first, it seems like it works.. but my hair ultimately dries very straw-like. I have fine, wavy, uncolored, shoulder length hair. Since I paid so much money for it, I will continue to use it for up-keep.  I don't have high hopes, but will update my review if anything changes."

Secondly, this did nothing for my hair except make it feel slightly tacky and extremely dull, like it was coated with something.  The next time I shampooed, my hair texture and condition were not improved in any way. In fact, the bottom 2/3 of my medium length hair looks and feels like straw. I followed the directions very carefully. My hair is professionally colored using a partial foil every 12 weeks. I use exclusively professional products, shampooing only 1 or 2x per week, and I never heat style."

Once your hair is bleached thoroughly, the damage is done permanently. The only way to remove the bleach damage is to cut the hair off.   This product left a mask that satisfied the needs of my hair, the dryness and frizz gone, and the next morning when I woke up, I was really happy to see that my hair still looked calm and clean, and even saw that my natural wave was really prominent without any other styling products. The smell was very light and it was gone within an hour of putting it in. Running a brush through my hair, which usually results in lots of hair snapping off, had hardly any fall out.   Overall, I am very pleased and this replace several products in my haircare routine."

However, this mask helps to make it softer, easier to brush through, and generally more easy to upkeep and style. I use a generous amount, warm it up in my palms, and then apply it through mid-length to ends. It works for me. Smell is meh, but way better than the K18 hair oil, which smells terrible IMO."

So, if you're having issues with dryness or frizz, try adding other conditioning products after K18. I'll never use Olaplex again and my hair is so much healthier. My color lasts longer and I have very little breakage and no split ends with regular trims. That was never the case before. I wash my hair once a week and I use K18 once a month. Twice if I've been out in the weather a lot. I'm not a fan of the packaging. I typically rip my bottle open to get every last bit out of it because it's so pricey."

However, I found K18 to work better for me. I used it 6 washes in a row per the instructions. I disliked it after the first use. A lot of influencers with long hair are recommending 4 pumps so I tried that, and my hair felt so weighed down but dry at the ends. I rinsed it out the next day. So less is more with this product! Since then I have used 3 pumps: divided hair in half, 1 pump on the lower ends of each side, and 1 pump for the entire top half of my hair. I do NOT emulsify it in my hands until it turns white because this rubbed in a lot of the product into my palms. I just spread it even in my palms and then apply. After 4 minutes, I detangle and use a conditioner mask and rinse after 30 minutes or so. I started seeing an improvement in smoothing, less frizz, and more shininess/reflectiveness after the 3rd usage. It also makes my hair dry faster (both air-dried or blow-dried) which was an unexpected positive effect. My hair is not softer than if I use just a conditioning mask but my ends seem to be better moisturized. Now I use K18 every 2-3 washes. I know it is expensive but the trial side is probably big enough for you to give it a good try and see if it works for you. The trial pump dispenses a different amount than the full size so start with the lowest amount recommended by K18 and then add a little more if needed."

A couple of days past by and I started noticing that my split ends were gone and the hair looked way healthier. Same thing happened the second time I tried.

I can tell because each time I washed my hair or manipulated it broken curls would be all over my floor and hands.  I was skeptical of using this because of the alcohol in it and the instructions to not use conditioner but i checked the product page website and it is OK to use conditioner after the 4 minutes and rinse it out because the product has already penetrated the hair shaft and worked. My hair can tangle hair so I applied in small sections and worked the  product in my hands before applying.  I let it sit for 4 mins then re wet my hair to apply my deep conditioner. Immediately after rinsing out my conditioner there weren’t much broken curls on the shower floor. The first time in ages! And I’ve tried other bond builders and protein treatments. My curls were soft, springy, and uniform. I had no idea my curls could look uniform. I blow dried my hair for a braid down and still no broken hairs as usual. Anyways I’m completely in awe of this product. I will use it the 4x in a row as recommended and then do maintenance. I am so happy for this product. It is saving my hair. Do not be put off by the alcohol in it if you have naturally coily hair. It didn’t dry my hair out at all."

My manager and friends noticed that my hair look healthier. The trick is to be gentle when shampooing your hair (don’t lather so much that you create more tangled and knots). Towel dry for 5 mins. For shoulder length medium dense hair, 2 pumps, lather between hands, and apply roots to ends. Wait 4-5 mins, apply your styling products. I found using a hydrating serum helped combat any frizz and dryness. Then of course finish with a hair oil on the ends."

I followed directions:  for the first couple of weeks, take a shower, shampoo but DONT condition, towel dry and then apply K18. I know… no conditioner feels like a crime. But here’s my trick for making this work: before my shower, I brush my hair well, to detangle. Then, while shampooing, I still scrub my scalp (I use the Briogeo scalp products), but I try to use my fingers to lightly detangle while shampooing.  It won’t be anything like conditioner, but you’ll be able to detangle a little bit. Then rinse the shampoo out carefully, don’t scrub and add more knots. Next, towel dry and then I attempt to very patiently brush out my wet hair starting from the bottom, working my way up. I eventually get to the roots and then can apply 1-2 pumps of K18. I swear by it now.   I also met this amazing gay man out in LA a few weeks ago, he had the longest, shiniest hair… when I asked him his hair routine, he credited K18 and said he’d been religiously using it for about a month to get those results.   Honestly, give it a try if you can afford it, my hair hasn’t felt this good and healthy since before I started getting highlights and using heated styling tools."

I will say it does work however as per the instructions you are not to condition your hair before using, which is understandable as the conditioner blocks the product from penetrating the shaft of the hair.  Now for me not using conditioner is not ideal. Nonetheless I used the product as instructed and brushing the product through my hair caused more hairs to break resulting in more hair on my wet brush. Now it falls on me to read the instructions before purchasing so that was my fault.   Before this product I used another bonding mask which worked just as well as K18 (and I could condition my hair). However the only downside is I could only get 2 uses out of the container which was around $50.   For me it is a toss up if I will repurchase this specific product from this line. Yes it is twice as much as my other bonding masks however I get more uses out of the product.   If I do decide to purchase another K18 I believe I will consider the shampoo instead.   Do I recommend this specific product, No. I do recommend other products from the K18 line."

This is extremely difficult and even more damaging, if you have very thick, severely compromised and tangled hair, from bleaching/coloring. I also mixed it with Olaplex the first go. The second time I used it, I did as they instructed, and I personally wouldn’t do it this way again. You also need a lot more product than they say. The tiniest bit of conditioner will save you from having to use more of this product than is necessary. I understand that they’re going for maximum penetration into the hair, but when hair is severely compromised, this is frustrating.  I also don’t like the fact that there is added protein in this, since my hair overdoses on it pretty easily. Using it alone made it more brittle. I’ll continue using it, but only mixed with other products, because it’s just too drying for me, personally. I do think the research behind the molecule is found, and hopefully they’ll come out with other formulations."

I've since purchased the larger bottle, so I have 2 more uses to go before I move into maintenance.  The first time, I kept it in for 4 minutes and washed it out (K18 says that's fine) and then used conditioner.  The second time, I kept it in as the instructions say.  My hair was definitely drier when I left it in, so the last two times, I've washed it out and then use Amika The Kure mask as a conditioner.  This is my sweet spot. I can't say that the damage has been repaired, but I can say that it looks and feels like it has.    I was skeptical through the first two uses as I didn't see much of a change.  But I've really noticed a change after the last two, so if you are wondering if it really works, I would say push through. It's the first time I've been happy with my hair in months!"

My experience with many beauty products has resulted in an inverse relationship between expectations and performance. To put this one to the test, I needed to follow the instructions to the T.     After using the K18 Peptide Detox Shampoo, I partially towel-dried my hair, then applied a small amount, a little over a teaspoon, to the middle and ends. After exactly four minutes, I added my styling products and began the blow-drying process. What immediately stuck out was how my hair felt coated, but not heavy. I feared the results would be stringy, clumped together strands, and that I would soon be re-washing my hair. But what happened was the opposite. The mask gave my hair a certain weight, without weighing it down. It helped to smooth, without appearing oily. Still, the next couple of days would be telling; would I wake up to a greasy mess?  Surprisingly, no - even after a couple of days, my hair retained its appearance without the aid of dry shampoo or other products. After the initial period of using after every shampoo, I now incorporate it once a week to maintain my hair health. What I love most about this is that it works double duty; it nourishes and aids in styling. For someone with thin, fine hair, that is a rare and treasured combination, earning it high marks and my recommendation."

I have not bleached my hair or used any chemical treatments for over 6 months after an unfortunate over bleaching incident. I have just been trimming and trying to rehab my hair. I have enough hair that the breakage is not too obvious but I can tell how damaged my ends are when I wash it. It’s tangly and breaks easily when wet. I have to be very careful with detangling and styling.   All that being said I think that is why this product does not work for me. I used it exclusively for 6 weeks a few weeks after the horrible bleaching incident. Before that I used Olaplex steps 0, 3, 4C, 5 and 8. This was working great for me but dang all those steps together take a lot of time and expense but my hair looked amazing when it was styled and dry. I heard about K18 from an online curly hair YouTuber and it sounded amazing. Only two steps and 4 mins (!!) leave on time. Sign me up!   I thought I was noticing more breakage when I used it but at that time my hair was super fragile and I figured it was to be expected. It never got much better during those 6 weeks. I stuck it out trying to tell myself that the time saved was worth it and the breakage was expected etc. The thing was when it was dry I found it to be pretty soft but it was much frizzer than with the Olaplex. It would look good for a day or two then it was not great. My long Olaplex routine was giving me nice soft frizz free hair for days. So I ended up going back and immediately had very little breakage and my hair looked and felt much better.   I was in a rush on my wash day last week and used K18 and boy that just drove it home for me. My hair was a tangled mess with it in. It really seemed to make it worse and it felt just as bad as it did several months ago when I first had it bleach fried. It was awful and scary. I used Olaplex a few days later and it’s great again. It takes forever b"

I can't say if this actually improved the splits at all but I noticed my hair feels smoother/less frizzy after using this.

			"review_text": "Licensed hair dresser here. After reading some of the bad reviews I thought I should jump in to explain some things.   This is a repair mask that you leave in. But this is not the same as a normal leave in conditioner. Once you apply this to your hair (do not exceed the amount instructed) and the 4 minutes have passed you need to follow up with your regular leave in products. This is not a heat protector nor meant to be your styling product.  You should only use this consecutively for 4-6 washes depending on the condition of your hair. If you use this too much you will be adding too much protein to your hair and it will feel like straw (the over use of the olaplex mask can also do this to your hair). Once you’ve surpassed 4-6 washes, this should only be used for maintenance. So use this maybe once a week or even once every two weeks.   If your hair feels dry and brittle and you’re not using any products in your hair to add hydration and moisture, it is normal for your hair to feel that way. Most products that are meant to repair the hair are meant to strengthen, not hydrate or moisturize. After reading the ingredients, I do not see any hydrating or really moisturizing agents listed. (Olaplex alone is the same which is why you have to buy the entire line in order for it to work properly)  This product works. I use this on my baby fine, dry, curly hair. I do not wear my hair curly. I blowdry and style after every wash. I have noticed a big difference after using this treatment. But this treatment alone is not going to work miracles. There is no repairing conditioning mask on the market that is able to do that.   This brand has a whole education section on their website if anyone feels confused about what this mask is supposed to do because the description on here is very vague and does not paint the whole picture.  I hope this information helps!"

It has made a crazy difference! Especially noticeable when I straighten my hair, silky smoothness and it actually looks healthy! Typically my ends can get crispy with straightening and it’s a dead giveaway that it does not grow out of my head straight.

I layer conditioner directly over the top, rinse, then style as usual. I've experimented with the recommended instructions and unfortunately my hair still really needed the extra moisture. I use this product in conjunction with peptide repairing conditioners, protein, and moisture treatments for best results.  If your hair has a weird filmy texture or coarseness, it's possible you may be doing something wrong. You have to put it on clarified hair and you have to leave it for 4 minutes so it can penetrate. Occlusive products afterwards is fine. Looking forward to my long white locks!"

I just can’t seem to get the dampness of my hair right for this to work and my hair feels sticky and tangled, which ends up causing more damage as I continually try to brush and detangle my hair. I don’t think this works for moderately damaged, fine hair types, from what I’ve read. Two stars because the day after I wash my hair feels alright (nothing special) and it’s not caused me any damage. Perhaps it worked a bit in the beginning and now I’m just at saturation point with it? Not impressed. Sadly I’ve gone through four of these (yes, that’s $300 I’ve dropped) since it came out and I started using it, tweaking the application each time, and only a few times did I feel like this may have improved my hair. I’ll head back to my overpriced kerastase which at least leaves my hair silky and detangled. Also I’ve used olaplex religiously in the past and was quite happy with those results."

When I say I cannot live without this, I am NOT lying. I use it every time I wash (recently picked up both of their shampoos), I allow my hair to airdry for 20 minutes or so, warm up 1 pump in my palms and apply starting at the ends and working my way up to the roots. This has never left my hair feeling weighed down or lifeless (except when I experimented using two pumps) and it's easier to style and the immediate results are shocking. I have noticed great improvements in my hair health since incorporating this in to my routine. Even when using their more intense clarifying shampoo (the detox) which leaves my hair a little ratty and unmanageable, as soon as this is applied I am left with hair that feels repaired and uncompromised.  I've never been one for hair masks or treatments and 98% of conditioners leave my hair feeling weighed down and waxy. I am so glad I found this!"

			"review_text": "I've been waiting to write this review because I wanted to do a simple cost-analysis, so let's get to it! First off, I have no idea about the amount of product that comes out of 1 pump even though that would've made the math easier. I could have measured it with a teaspoon or something, but I didn't want to waist any product. Second, I shared my first bottle with my sister. So I decided the sensible way to analyse the cost of this first bottle was to track usage over time. Usage here refers to how often we used the mask. You should know that between the 2 of us, we were using an average of 2-3 pumps per use. Both my sister and I differ in thickness (mine being thinner out of the 2 of us), and hair lengths varied while using this bottle. Generally, when our hair was longer we used more pumps vs when we had short hair.  The cost results?! After taxes, 1 bottle costs $3.59/use. It lasted us 11 months! If we want to look as cost per pump, we're looking (roughly) $1.20 to $1.80/pump (again, roughly).  As for the hair results, my sister and I couldn't be happier with! Our texture is SO soft after using this. Obviously other haircare techniques will help with maintaining great texture (using oils before washing/brushing, sleeping on silk, etc.), so this product can't do the job alone. But no product can.  Is this mask a necessity? Not for people with minimally damaged hair. But for the price of $3.59 per use over 11 months (know that my sister and I stretch the time suggested by the company to 5-6 washes in-between uses), why not try it for fun?!"

Skipping conditioner in the shower is not doing anything great for my hair. While applying, it feels like I don’t get it evenly spread, even though I split my hair into four sections. The first time I used it, I left ir on for the four minutes, I sprayed in leave in/derangler, and let it air dry. I didn’t notice a difference. The second and third time, I waited until it was 80 % dry and blow dried. It looked really nice, I noticed a huge difference in shine, it looked less dry (not a miracle, and still had dry ends), and I was excited. The fourth time, I used my detangler/leave in conditioner but ir wasn’t the same as using conditioner, and I had a lot of breakage while trying to brush it after applying everything. The whole point of this is to restore hair health and prevent breakage, but for me (and I assume a lot of dry/damaged haired people), I have to have conditioner. I still have some left so I will leave it in for four minutes I’m the shower, apply conditioner, and rinse out. I cannot use this with just leave in conditioner/deranged anymore, or all of my hair is going to fall out."

I followed the recommendations and did 4 consecutive washes using this and then have used this every 3 washes since. I have tried both blow drying and air drying after using this product.  First: I feel like this does not work well with other product that I add to my hair. I ended up buying a few new products and they seem to work, but my previous go-tos are a no when I use this. My hair felt weighed down and heavy. Products with oil in them seem to be the culprits.  Second: A little bit does go a really long way! I think the price of the full size might (might) be worth it if all I need is 2 pumps. I have very long waist length hair that is not super thick. I have not used much of the mini after about 8 applications. Third: I notice a difference. My hair is softer and seems to be a little healthier, BUT, I cannot really tell if it is this product or the new products I have been using or a combination of all of them. Also, while I do notice a difference, it is not a huge difference - not enough for me to run out and buy more.  Last: The application is so weird - I have NEVER washed my hair and not conditioned in the shower. Ever. Period. It seems so wrong to shampoo and then get out of the shower. The first time I did this treatment, I shampooed in the shower, and then lightly towel dried my hair so that it was not dripping with a microfiber towel. I honestly did my skin care routine and then applied this to my hair. My wet hair without conditioner felt wrong and gross, however, once I applied this, my hair felt right again and conditioned. I waited the 4 minutes before adding other product and styling as recommended.   Overall, will i buy more - maybe but probably not right away. I do not think this is a huge game changer, but I would recommend for someone to try to see if it works for them."

Only significant thing of note for me was it recommends not putting in conditioner, but I have a fine texture and this didn't work for me even with leave in conditioner after. I am not by any means recommending not to follow the directions, only for me I shampooed my hair, left this in 4 minutes, added my conditioner, left it in another amount of time, and then rinsed out my conditioner and still saw results. A little goes a long way! I don't need many pumps for both sides of my hair when using before conditioning even though I have long hair. I definitely feel like this product is worth every penny and once my hair reached maximum health, I am only using for maintenance. Thank you so much for such an amazing product!"

It lays down like healthy hair, moves like healthy hair, and has cut the frizz. My hair for reference is fine, bleach blonde highlights from a medium brown base and very very damaged at the ends.  I’m sad about the price but I’ll save but for me, it’s worth it. I won’t have to buy countless new products so that’s a savings there. Curious now about the other products in the line but don’t want to overdo the protein. Might use those but rotate with hydrating options."

I took my time and brushed my hair out (Dae brush..amazing!)…it took a long time but I got through it.  I then split my hair in two and applied 2 pumps to each side. I scrunched it up first then ran my fingers through it (Abby Yung has good tips). Left in in for 4 min then applied Olaplex 6 mixed with 7 and blow dried. Next time I am going to do 1-1 1/2 pumps and maybe less of the leave in, because my hair wasn’t as dry.  I wash 1-3 times a week and I am going to do 6 consecutive washes then go into maintenance (or use as I want).  My hair is highlighted. I use Pureology hydrate shampoo. If you wanted to rinse and apply regular conditioner you can after 4 min. To my knowledge this works for the inside of your strands not the outside and it takes 4 min to reach where it’s supposed to go. But honestly using a leave in is fine."

With one or 2 pumps in your hand, rub your hands together like you would soap. It eventually turn into a thicker lotion-like consistency. ( I didn't know this either. I watched a video from k18 to show me) 3) Use clarifying shampoo before  Back to my review. I have 4c hair. I hadn't flat ironed my hair in 4 years and went to a salon to get a silk press. huge mistake! She fried my hair out! after 2 washes my hair still smelled like it was on fire! I cried and was so close to chopping it all off. My tight coils were gone and my hair went from 4c to 3b/c. Went back to the salon to get redone by someone else and they used olaplex no 3. It made it a little better but I still had horrible split ends and my hair was falling out terribly. it was weak and brittle.   I used K18 ONE TIME and MY COILS CAME BACK! WITH JUST ONE APPLICATION...IM STILL SHOCKED! I CRIED I WAS SO HAPPY! Since I didn't know that I could make the product thicker by rubbing my hands together, I used 8 pumps which is wayyyy too much! I could've gotten away with using just 4 or 5, if that. After apply k18, I waited 4 minutes and then put hyaluronic hair lotion by Bumble and Bumble first, followed by leave in conditioner for bond repair by Bumble and Bumble. My hair is noticeably stronger and stopped falling out. it's also made my usual leave in products feel much softer in my hair. My hair isn't completely 100 percent but it has done an amazing job so far with just 1 use. I did NOT expect these results based on poor reviews but I gave it a shot and SO GLAD I DID! If your hair is noticeably damaged, believe me you WILL SEE RESULTS! Just be sure to apply it right."

I noticed some texture changes and easier breakage happening so I decided to give this a try given the rave reviews. My hair definitely feels softer but I haven’t noticed much of a change in visual texture (it’s still pretty frizzy). I followed the instructions of washing with clarifying shampoo only, splitting my hair into 6 sections when wet, and applying 1-2 pumps to each section. Then I would brush it out gently to distribute the product. I don’t know if I’m not using enough because I do have thick/ long hair and there’s not really any indicators of how much is too much/ too little per person based on hair amount.  I’m scared of using too much because of potential protein damage so some clarity would be welcome! I enjoy the smell and texture of the product."

Which means that I cannot make my hair manageable without using conditioner (I actually use hair masks because conditioners are not rich enough for me). This was until I saw Abbey Yung YT video in which she explains she contacted the company and asked if it was possible to use conditioner AFTER the application of K18 and the company said it can be used like that.  So I finally bought this product! I detox shampoo my hair first, towel dry and apply 4 pumps after sectioning my hair in 4. Let it sit for 4 minutes and then go back in the shower and apply a hair mask, then rinse off and continue with my haircare routine. K18 isn’t supposed to rinse off with water and I find this the only reasonable way to use this product effectively while avoiding to have my hair looking like a nest because of skipping conditioner. So far I’m happy with the results I see (I only used the product 3 times because I’m not a frequent washer). I have very fine and fragile african hair and I put a lot of heat on it and my hair has been looking pretty good and healthy lately. Will definitely leave another review after using the product for a bit longer but so far I’m happy with the result as my hair seems very healthy despite all the tortures I do to it lol"

Next, I let it sit for 4min and then did not follow with a conditioner. My hair was such a tangly mess and even though I brushed my hair very carefully, I felt like I was damaging my hair more with no conditioner because of all the breakage happening during brushing and blow drying. Again, I was very careful, but without conditioner, it was so difficult to manage my hair. Once my hair was dried, I noticed it was a bit softer than usual, but it also got greasy way faster.

I was searching for something besides Olaplex cause I have the ENTIRE OLAPLEX LINE and use it religiously and have felt and saw no changes, even though I have been using it for months now.  When I saw the price of this 1.5oz item I was in shock but if you add up the OLAPLEX shampoo, conditioner, leave in , mask, and oil that’s allot more then the $75 price tag!! So I pulled the plug and got it. After one use I can really feel the difference.  I have very dry curly hair that I straighten, so the thought of not using conditioner scared me, but surprisingly my hair feels how it felt before all the bleach and hair colors! I know in my photo you can’t see a difference but it’s how it feels for me !!"

I used as directed and the results were the exact opposite of what it claimed. My hair was much more tangled than normal and it did not have any impact on frizz. The next day, it was even worse! So tangled, odd texture feel to my hair, more frizz, and difficult to style.  I would not recommend this product to anyone at all, ever. Extremely disappointed."

			"review_text": "I literally only bought this because of a tiktok video i saw 2 months ago. Before that, i never even heard of or seen this brand before.  My hair is platinum blonde, and i’ve been platinum blonde for about 3 years straight now. I’ve used olaplex since i first went platinum, and have had issues with the product only when bought from amazon. It would make my hair feel frizzy and dry. When i bought it from sephora or straight from their website it would make my hair feel amazing when used in moderation. I began to only use it 2 times a month at most so that i wasn’t stressing my hair with the strong ingredients. My hair is around mid waist length and is on the finer side for reference.  2 days after using k18, i was happy and thought it was working wonders for my hair. i thought it was a step up from olaplex like i’ve seen some others say. I loved the smell and i felt like it made the flyaways less apparent. The first 1-2 uses made my hair feel more soft as well.  It started to feel a little drying by the third use. After showering a couple days later after the third use, i put my 4th application in. I was drying my hair infront of a fan gently combing my fingers throughout my hair. I noticed my hair felt like it was drying slower than usual, and it felt a bit more tangled/rough than usual?  I then felt a noticeable chunk of hair in the back of my head that seemed more damaged than the rest of my hair. I dragged my hand down from the root of my head to the bottom of that section, where i had discovered that it broke off multiple inches down from my root. I never have noticed that prior to starting the k18 treatment. I’m pretty sure i would have noticed that level of breakage if i had it prior to using k18..  This is the first time since going platinum that i’ve ever gotten significant breakage, especially in one area. I highly do not recommend this product for girls with bleached hair (especially fine hair), since i’m almost certain it’s what broke my hair off."

I have a ton of thick, fine, pin-straight blonde hair (naturally level 7-7.5) that a hairdresser fried about 3 years ago. I've been using a ton of products to get it back to its original strength, namely Olaplex, but I noticed my hair was developing a weird texture with it. I used a clarifying shampoo and decided it's time to try something new.  In comes K18. I have no idea how this product works so well, but it has been life-changing for me. No more weird texture, no sitting around for hours with Olaplex all over my head, and you can apply leave-ins/other products and style right after the 4 minutes are up. Every time I use this, I'm shocked at how soft and manageable my hair is, especially considering I didn't even use conditioner.   I got full highlights for the first time in roughly 6 months last week, and my hairdresser was blown away at how little damage I had. As she was blowdrying my hair, she kept showing me the round brush in amazement that not a single hair had snapped and no hairs were coming out onto the brush. I have been getting highlights for close to 15 years, and my hair has not felt this way since the first time I got them done in middle school. I seriously cannot believe how healthy my hair looks.  Is it expensive? Yes. Is it worth it? YES. I wish I had found this years ago - it would've saved me so much time and money from all of the different treatments I've tried. I will never buy another bottle of Olaplex again. Obviously I can't speak for other hair types/concerns, but if you're someone who's experienced bleach damage in the past, you must try K18!"

My main struggles are split ends and dullness.  This was ok. My hair was in a fine state actually thanks to other bond rebuilders, protein treatments, and deep conditioning. But I tried this anyway since I thought it'd be better. I think this works. After three consecutive uses (could not get any more out of it)  my hair is still fine, and considering the fact that I haven't been conditioning, it's doing great. But applying this is a nightmare, and I feel like that makes it less effective. I tried to use a few pumps because it's so expensive and is mostly alcohol which damages the cuticle, but it's so hard to distribute. My hair is not even curly or coily so for them it must be even worse.   The difference wasn't drastic, this product is very expensive, very small, and very hard to use. So I think I'll pass. Maybe I'll revisit it if my hair starts acting up without it. Anyways it was mid x"

Pros: Hair fees stronger and less damaged  No need to use conditioner in shower Seems to mitigate damage  Cons: In order for product to penetrate hair and provide optimal results, you must use clarifying shampoo beforehand, which has a tendency to dry out hair and create tangles.  Using clarifying shampoo strips colored hair over time, requiring more visits to the salon.   That said, it can bring damaged, brittle hair back to life… at the expense of stripping color and moisture from hair. If color fade isn’t a concern for you, this might be a great product for you. I plan on going back to Olaplex 3 and using k19 after my monthly clarifying shampoo."

I still continue to use my regular hair care routine which includes oils leave in conditioners masks and so on. I definitely reduced my hair care routine products since using K 18. I do find my hair to be extremely softer but I’ve noticed minimal improvement in my hair Health. I definitely think there’s nothing that can help damaged hair such as bleached hair. For the last six months I stop using heat products hair colours. And was hoping that the K18 would maximize my hair health. Unfortunately, it has improved it minimally and it was a great run but I don’t think I will be purchasing it again. It is better than the olaplex products combined but not quite good enough to justify the price. I recommend this if you want only one product for ur hair care routine and ur hair is not damaged to begin with, it will add shine to ur hair.  Thanks for reading.  cheers"

I reached out to the company to see if the shampoos I had were compatible ( I heard you have to be careful that the shampoo you use with this product does not have silicone's, or ingredients that will block the products ability to penetrate into your hair) So once I heard back from the customer service I went in for the first try.   It was shampoo, rinse well, towel dry and bit, than apply the product.  I used 4 pumps of the trial size bottle ( the large bottle gives more product per pump but all the information about how much they suggest to use is on thier website) I let the product sit in my hair for 4 minutes and I was scared but didn't apply conditioner as they reccomend. I figured I'd risk it and see what happened. I lost faith that my hair would be manageable so I did end up putting Olaplex no.9 and then a little Olaplex Oil no.7 in my hair. It dried and wow! My hair looked and felt so nice and healthy.   I've done 3 treatments now and I love the way my hair looks and feels.  I have been taking a break from heat styling and I love the way my hair has turned out all 3 times. I plan on continuing up to the 6th application as they suggest and than using K18 every 3rd or 4th wash.  Nothing has made my hair this nice.  I save time without masks, conditioners and long treatments. My hair dries faster and nicer. I don't know what my long term results will be but I'm excited to find out."

It’s expensive, but for me a little goes a long way. I have long hair and it only takes 1 pump to go through all of my hair. (I do have fine hair)"

			"review_text": "I’ve been getting K18 treatments done at my salon when I color my hair and I’ve noticed such an improvement in the overall health of my hair so I started buying it from Sephora to do at home. I suspect the negative reviews are due to people using this who don’t need more protein in their hair. Seriously, you need to figure out how much protein vs moisture your hair needs before trying a product like this. Yes it’s not technically a protein treatment but it gives your hair more of the building blocks of proteins so it’s essentially the same. If your hair is dry and brittle after using K18 then your hair needs more moisture, not a product like this!!! Also, if your hair gets matted if you don’t use conditioner I would try a cowash with this product or a more gentle cleanser. It’s a great product but it’s not for everyone. It can be heavy on your hair so I don’t like to add too many products after. I also notice more of an improvement after I’ve washed it out and it has had a chance to work it’s magic."

			"review_text": "Background info: My hair type is fine, dense, level 7/8ish natural with bleached platinum blonde and 2A or possibly B curl. It’s long, maybe 20”. I’m a longtime user of olaplex and Brazilian bond, my hair responds very well to protein every 2 weeks or more if I’m swimming a lot or recently got my hair bleached.   Like many reviewers I was hesitant to try this, given the instructions. My hair tangles/knots atrociously after showering and I have to majorly saturate it with oil and curl creams to even think about brushing it. never mind without conditioner! I had just been swimming and my hair was stripped of all its toner, protein treatments and moisture. I used Briogeo super moisture shampoo (no silicones). My hair felt awful and was very dry and tangled at this point, which is typical for me before I condition. I hesitantly got out of the shower and tried to blot my hair with a t shirt. I then applied the entire sample size tube to my hair, a small amount at a time. i did my best to really work it in, but it was tough with all the tangles and knotting. My hair felt stiff and dry, not less tangled at all. I was pretty worried and nearly got in the shower to rinse it out. I waited 5 minutes and it felt the same, still. I then added my usual curl cream (moroccan oil) and the olaplex oil. Those made my hair feel a bit better and I was able to loosely brush through some of it, very gingerly.   Then…. my hair dried. and Wow. For real my hair is soooo shiny. shinier than it has been in years of color services. It also feels so soft and has superior texture. I cannot express how shocked I am at the luster of my strands right now. It’d be tough for me to shell out 75 bucks for this but….. I might have to. I had to use the whole sample on my hair. There were some spots I wasn’t able to get the product on, they’re visibly more frizzy than the ends where I was really able to work it in. So if you have a lot of hair, this is probably one of the most expensive hair products."

My hair is damaged (chemically), dry, mostly fine, and i have a TON of it. I get it permanently straightened, which damages it but actually helps it be brushable. It's now grown out a ways and the zig-zag curl pattern outgrowth is a nightmare to brush out, even when the majority of my hair is straight. I've tried leave in's, olaplex products, oils etc. Helpful, but I have to say...  THERE IS NOTHING LIKE THIS on the market. I know the technology is new & they DID IT. I have applied this exactly twice and my hair feels TRANSFORMED. I am not being hyperbolic. It really is different. It's easier to brush (which is the biggest thing to me, as I get little knots and rats nests all up in there after sleeping, that are so painful, I sometimes just put it in a bun so I don't have to deal). But it's wild. My hair looks UNDAMAGED. Healthy.   After the first application I was like 'wait... my hair... FEELS DIFFERENT. Not 'coated in quality conditioner' different. But ACTUALLY different. It changed my hair. For real.   It doesn't feel like i've left anything in my hair. My hair feels clean and soft. Not heavy or sticky or anything like that at all.  I'm gonna just say it, this is basically a miracle.   While a miracle is WORTH the money for sure, this is very pricey and I used 1/3 of the large jar on my hair each application. I do have a TON of hair, and it's down to my butt. So this is an investment. And I will be making it again. That's how good it is.  This is a repair mask... not sure if it's suitable for non-chemically damaged hair, so know that going in. This isn't just 'for dryness'. I believe in using the correct products for your hair type."

My hair is always extremely soft after. I usually put it on and leave it for 4 minutes, like the instructions say, when my hair is damp. I wouldn't recommend putting it on when there's still water dripping from your hair. I wouldn't say it transformed my hair, but it's definitely a good alternative if you can't use conditioner. It makes my hair feels more nourished and softer than most leave-in conditioners, but if you can't afford this, a good leave-in conditioner is an option as well."

			"review_text": "Please read my review! This product is the Holy Grail. Anybody who writes a review saying otherwise, simply isn't using it correctly. The first step when using this product is to shampoo your hair, and skip the conditioner. Sounds crazy right? Well, in order for this product to penetrate the hair you need to use a silicone free shampoo. I repeat, use a silicone free shampoo! A lot of clarifying shampoo still have silicone in it.... Just shop around and find a silicone free one. You're better off using dish soap rather than a shampoo that has silicone in it, because then you're just wasting your money on this product if you aren't going to strip your hair before using it. Your hair will be a tangled mess, especially if you have baby fine hair like me. But this product will work and you'll eventually be able to detabgle your hair after a few minutes! After you shampoo and towel dry your hair... Just leave it a tiny bit damp... When you use a pump or two of this product, rub it together in the palms of your hands and it turns into a very watery consistency. Start working it into your strands starting at the ends, then working your way up. You will instantly feel your hair get softer, and should be able to detangle it after a few minutes. The important thing during this part is to let the product sit in your hair for a full four minutes before adding any additional hair product. You just let it sit in your hair and basically soak into the hair. I have been using olaplex ever since it came out, I have tried every Bond Building Products including Redken, Bumble and Bumble, Brazilian Bond Builder, Etc. This product is different. If you use a shampoo first with silicone, emulsifying wax, Polyquaternium, or any type of silicone at all then you probably will not see results with K18. The most important thing is to use a shampoo that isn't going to leave any residue or coating on your hair whatsoever, so that the K18 can always penetrate your hair strands."

My hair is bleached, curly, heat damaged and dry, dry, dry … the thought of going without conditioner of any kind?   I took the plunge and decided to use it when I was stuck at home with COVID. I washed my hair with baby shampoo, towel dried it and sectioned it into four. I have thick hair and applied about a dime size amount only to the most damaged parts and then used a wet brush to brush all my hair together.   I let my hair air dry and was absolutely shocked. My usually crispy frizzy hair dried into smooth soft waves.   I have used Olaplex 3 for years and haven’t had remotely similar results.   I have continued to use this product and my hair has continued to improve. My only concern is what happens if you stop using it? It’s not cheap and I know you have to use it on a maintenance basis."

I decided to purchase K19 leave in  I made sure to watch a few videos of how to use it. The product is an absolute game changer. The biggest tip I could get from watching the videos is that your hair should just be slightly damp and before applying the product to your hair section it off. I did section by section 1 pump at a time and I rubbed the products in my hand before applying it to my hair and then I combed it through. No need to overdo the product just enough to coat the hair. I made sure to let it sit for at least four minutes and then I blow dried my hair. As I started blow drying and feeling my hair I could tell instantly how much softer stronger and less brittle looking it was. Amazing !!!! Yes it’s pricy but it’s so worth it. I could see how not using conditioner for some people could be a pain to brush out their hair it once you get past that it’s so worth it."

After a few weeks of using this 2x a week, I've come to the conclusion that I don't like it as much as I thought. It's not hydrating enough for my bleached hair, and it only really makes the hair *feel* healthier for the first day or so. I noticed a little bit more breakage since using this, and I think it's due to the way you're meant to apply it to washed, unconditioned, damp hair. Your hair is the weakest when it's wet, so trying to gently work this through your stripped, damp hair definitely causes breakage if you're not careful.   It's also stupidly overpriced. Nearly $30 for half an ounce of product? I'll stick with Olaplex No 3. I've used that religiously for 3 years and should've known better than to stray."

My hair has never been more healthy, shiny, strong or curly. However, important to note that my hair is severely damaged from bleaching it to platinum blonde for the past year. The only way to keep up with my hair color and keep my hair healthy is with treatments like these. I'm a routine user of Olaplex, protein treatments, masks, leave-ins, etc. And I have never seen results like the ones I do from K18. With all of this said, I do not think everyone needs this product. If you have damaged, dry, chemically treated hair like mine, K18 is a miracle product and in my opinion, worth the high price tag. But, if you are just looking for something to maintain your already healthy hair, then don't spend the $75 on this. I will continue to repurchase this over and over as long as my hair is damaged and if your hair is as well-- I cannot recommend this enough. It is absolutely amazing."

			"review_text": "Fun fact: My first round of highlights were courtesy of my cousin after she completed cosmetology school in, yikes, 1985 (I think. After all, it was the 80s.) For the better part better part of 30+ years, I’ve been doing some serious damage, so getting a chance to use K18’s Leave-in Molecular Repair Hair Mask was a no brainer.  ❤️Repairs Your Hair: That’s one whale of claim, and K18 sets out to heal the hair both externally and internally. Instead of treating the cuticle (like regular conditioner) and the cortex (like bond builders) K18 goes to work on the cortical cells. Science-y lingo aside, I hear “repair,” “heal,” and “inside.” That’s new to me.  ❤️Results on Day One: I followed all the rules: freshly shampooed hair without using traditional conditioner. I used two pumps and coated my damp strands then waited about five minutes before combing out my hair. After blow drying, my hair was the softest it has been in years. It also felt sleek as if I had flat-ironed it.   ❤️Consistent Results When Used With Various Shampoos: Out of curiosity, I rotated my shampoos to see how K18 worked with each one. Whether it was a salon or celebrity brand, everyday, clarifying or moisturizing formula, the K18 consistently left my hair soft and silky. The hair texture was the biggest tell. My hair is very fine, but I have to flat iron it to get it completely straight. Not on my K18 days, though. The hair laid smoother and straighter with a simple blow dry session, which shortened my routine and helped me avoid further damage due to heat styling.  ❤️The Bottom Line: If you bleach, color, or use hot styling tools, K18 will improve your hair’s condition long-term. It’s not a quick fix; it’s a hair health booster. Bonus: It also softens the coarse gray hairs I obviously have. They may be hidden among the highlights, but their texture pre-K18 tells me I’m more gray than I realize … but I ain’t worrying about it with this in my routine.   Perfect in every way!"

Which has never happened before! First time I used it I don’t think I put enough in and my hair felt a bit dry. Then, using more, I’ve noticed way better moisture/strength results, but it DOES make my hair way more waxy/greasy. But for healthier hair… I’ll take it. I use it with a shower cap after I put it on and leave it for a good 10 mins in there, before putting other products in. I then let it air dry in braids.

In my experience and opinion, Olaplex No. 3 provides a more fully optimized/better result (hair shinier, silkier, healthier, and ends improved) HOWEVER; K18 is fast and easy (no 10 minute wait before rinsing out as K18 is a leave in conditioner).  Both are useful and effective.  If you have 10 minutes once a week, I highly recommend Olaplex No.3, but, if you are busy, reach for K18 which is better than nothing and a good 2nd option."

When I was washing my hair, I noticed that my hair felt stringy/gummy  during the first wash after getting highlights and as soon as I put this product on after getting out of the shower, my hair texture felt back to normal (or even better). This helps my split ends and my naturally curly hair texture as well, it’s basically magic in a bottle if you have any kind of texture/damage in your hair. It’s pricey but I really noticed a difference after using it three times. Buy it, you will not regret it!!"

The first time I tried this product, it felt very unorthodox not using conditioner and it just so happened to be a day where my hair was incredibly tangled- however this product surprised me. After detangling and working this product in and waiting a few minutes, my hair felt very hydrated. I also noticed once my hair dried my curls looked very defined and I had little to no frizz! I've now used this product 3 times and I've noticed with each use my hair looks and feels better and better. I was absolutely recommend this especially if you have frizz, damage, or dry hair.  *This was product was sent to me for free to try out however all opinions are my own.*"

I’ll be honest, this isn’t the best hair mask I have ever used (that title goes to Moroccan Oil). However,other hair masks ARE a bit of a hassle if you’re short on time. In order to get the best results with other masks I have to leave them on for at least 30 minutes or overnight, and spend considerable time rinsing them out of my hair. K18 takes the hassle our of masking. You just put it on like a leave in and it gives you hair treatment results. This is why I’m most likely to reach for this than any other hair mask in my beauty kit. Highly recommend."

My stylist gave me a list on instructions to follow when using this and thought I’d finally give in and try it. I was shook after my first use. My co workers asked if I had just gotten a blowout done. I’ve now used it every single hair wash since. The major con of it is that it’s expensive but the pros are you spend less time in the shower, you don’t need to buy expensive conditioners all the time, and you only need a little bit so the large bottle goes a long way.

My hair isn't always the smoothest in the world but I like to keep it long and blonde, so I do what I can to retain healthy hair but it's not always possible in the world of hot tools and tangles that sometimes leaves me with breakage. I'm not a loyal Olaplex user, but I've used it a couple of times at home and felt meh about it and wanted to try something different. I've had the chance to use this hair mask four times since I've gotten it and I have noticed that my hair has been laying down more straight and appears to look smoother after a brush for longer. My hair feels soft the day after I use it and as long as I'm not being careless with what I do with my hair (throwing haphazardly into high buns, for example) it means that way. And even then, after a quick brush, it returns back. I'd be curious how this performs right after I get my hair done next time to see how it can help it bounce back then, but I'm really looking forward to continuing using this and having this in my routine! It's been far more effective than other leave in masks I've tried over the years with my hair."

I asked my husband, who has long hair himself and notices healthy hair, if he could tell a difference in looks and feel (without telling him what is used). He said no.  If anything, my hair felt more damaged. Two of the four times I used my Dyson wand to style and had a tough time getting through the ends; it felt more brittle and tangly.

It's not only a question of pressure but you have to move it around to get barely any product out. Gonna return this on this very basis. If they fix the packaging in the future, I am willing to continue the treatmemt."

The directions state to shampoo your hair without conditioning it. I was very hesitant at first because I have very long coarse hair that tangles and practically dreads when I wash it. It’s always the conditioner that saves me from the knots. After washing my hair, I applied the product to my nappy hair. As it was drying I couldn’t notice any difference. By the time it was fully dry, I was completely AMAZED! K18 has transformed my hair. I’ve been struggling with postpartum hair loss and my hair has been so dull and lifeless. My hair finally felt silky again. No frizz, no knots. It looks and feels healthy as well. My mom is a hair dresser so I’ve tried all product under the sun. I can promise you this is a new fav. I will be buying this when I run out, and I will have my mom share it with her customers. Thank you K18, I’m extremely happy with the results!"

I’m also that girl that regularly highlights and colors her hair with every change of the season. I’ve been looking for a product that can bring back my soft, smooth hair, and the K18 leave-in molecular repair hair mask has delivered.   I followed the recommended two pumps for medium, long hair, but probably would have been fine with just one. From the onset I was really happy that the mask softened my hair without that usual weight you feel from leave-conditioners. After spreading it evenly throughout my damp hair, I got on with my usual routine for the 4-minute activation period. Once the window is up, I went on with styling my hair as usual with a quick blow dry and round brush curling.   It’s still early days, but my hair feels and looks great, and I love that this doesn’t make my hair greasy! I’m someone who typically washes her hair every other day, or so, and this mask seems to work in tandem with this routine. I’ve found this to be a great product for upkeep treatment and am looking forward to seeing how things progress."

My hair was breaking off along the stark application line, extremely elastic in patches, and a section even melted off completely while I was still in the salon chair.  Unfortunately, nothing can be done about the hair that melted off or broke off, BUT this molecular repair mask greatly improved the texture and reduced the elasticity of my extremely damaged hair.  My hair is still damaged (it's not going to magically give you your natural hair back), but now it has weight, heft, and strength again. I'm so glad I invested in this mask!

I used k18 out of a whim and after the first use I never looked back. I now save money sense this is The only hair product I will use besides shampoo. It does wonders for my bleach hair, it’s no longer damaged and looks like it did when it was virgin hair, I save money only buying this product, and my hair is the healthiest it’s ever been! This stuff is a miracle worker. I stock up during any sales times and make sure I never run out. I can’t live without this product. You have to use it right or else you won’t see the results so follow the directions as stated and you will be a happy customer. I can’t brag about this stuff enough. Try it and trust me if used right you will fall in love with this stuff. It works wonders on all hair types but does miracles for damaged color hair. If your unsure of paying for the large pricy one I suggest buying the sample size or the mini size to try out. And if you love it like I do then invest in the bigger size like i said you won’t be disappointed if used correctly and to me it’s worth the money! The results are amazing and worth the price you pay."

It smells so nice, and it absorbs into my hair right away without sticky or greasiness. After 3/4 mins my hair become so silky, soft, and smooth. I was so surprised since my hair has never been smooth without condition. After that, I dry my hair as usual.  2nd use:  I notice my hair is less dry after shampooing without conditioner compared to 1st use. There’s no slimy stuff when I wet my hair, I believe the solution definitely soaks into the base of my hair and repairs the root.  3rd and 4th use I feel like my hair is very healthy even with no conditioner, esp my root hair (original hair). My hair feels strong and smoother.   For my treated hair, I think they are healing and it’s very smooth and not dry at all after a shower without conditioner.

I did still apply a mask directly on my scalp because I suffer from dryness due to being on Accutane but rinsed thoroughly. When I aaplied it to my damp hair, it felt heavy and sticky. I have long hair and used about 2-3 pumps on each side combing through with each pump to evenly spread, waited 5 minutes, then applied my usual products. My hair felt heavy and took longer to dry and smooth out. It lacked shine that I couldnt even add on using hair oil. My hair feels softer and and smoother when I use Olaplex. I'll give it one more try in a few weeks but I don't forsee it being any better. Personally wouldn't recommend it at this time based on first impression."

Not drastically, but my hair felt smoother after I applied K18 and I didn't need to use as much leave in conditioner after the 4 minutes were up. My third try was were I noticed my hair felt softer and more manageable, but it wasn't until a few hours after I had dried and styled my hair that I could see and feel the difference in the texture of my hair. It now feels so soft, less brittle and hardly any frizz. I would highly recommend K18 if you are looking for a hair care product to improve your hair all around.

These are the hair mask instructions: After washing and towel drying your hair use anywhere from one to four pumps of product and work it through your hair. Wait four minutes and then style as usual - no rinsing. Start with one pump of product and go from there depending on how much hair you have and how thick it is.  I ended up using 4 pumps as my hair is quite long and thick. I don't blow dry my hair if I can help it, to give it a break from heat processing I let it dry overnight.  The smell is reminiscent of something from my childhood but I cannot place it.  Update:  My hair dried nicely, it definitely feels softer all the way through. Silk like. And the ends look a lot healthier already but I will come back to update after a few washes with before/after photos.  I would recommend this to anyone who has lots of chemically or heat processed damage to their hair like I do."

I could barely get a large pick through the ends and my hair was breaking. It was very similar to the state my hair was in when I used too much protein. It’s like my hair was crying out for moisture!

I did not condition, Then I towel dried, and massaged a total of four pumps into my long bleached hair, pump at a time.  After 4 minutes, I added a leave in conditioner and hair oil, and blow dried with a round brush.  My hair looks amazing, given how fried it is. I was experiencing so much breakage. But my hair looks spectacular, comparatively, and it feels so much better.   For me, this is better than olaplex, without a doubt.   Also, when you consider that you will not need a conditioner with it, it’s not much more expensive than olaplex plus a conditioner."

I got the small size bottle just to try it out and I had to section my hair in half and work my way up. It was hard because you can’t condition after you shampoo so my hair does get very tangled. But after applying the product, brushing out my hair wasn’t very bad which is a good thing. I left my hair damp, applied the mask, and went back to apply the rest of my products.

Breakage is normal for me, sadly, and I go through tons of conditioner and leave in treatments just to be able to get a comb through my hair without breaking it. So when the instructions said to skip the conditioner and use this instead, I was definitely skeptical. But I did as instructed and was amazed to find that not only was I able to comb through my wet hair easily, without breakage, but my hair was left soft and manageable! I’ve used this several times now and I’m honestly kind of shocked at how healthy my hair feels; and this is after I just had my hair highlighted 2 weeks ago! This stuff is gold! Now I know why it’s so expensive. I’m definitely going to have to keep this in my routine for a long as I’m bleaching my hair, because I’ve never used anything that works so well. Highly recommend!"

I followed the directions on the bottle and as mentioned you don’t add to condition your hair the day you plan on using the product Typically after shampooing, my hair is in desperate need of moisture, so skipping that step made me a bit hesitant.   A pump and a half of the product were enough for my long, color-treated hair and after air drying, my hair was soft and easy to comb through. (My hair texture easily knots up after a shower and typically requires me to add a lot of product to my routine to untangle). I was glad that this was a simple product that instantly did the job. I will definitely continue to use the product and would highly recommend it to a friend!"

However now, after the third use, I notice my hair looking overall healthier while still being super soft. I'm hoping that this might even improve more ofter the next few uses (it is recommended to use the treatment 4-6 in a row before switching to weekly applications). I also like the ease of use: Other hair treatments need to be left in for 20 minutes and then rinsed out, while this one only needs to sit for 4 minutes and then can be styled as usual (no rinsing necessary!)."

Same result the third time. My hair was also much more manageable! I was fully in loved. Today…not so much. It took me almost 40 minutes to dry my hair and it looks like I stuck it in an oil drum.

I tried this mask on a wash day, double washed my hair with the ouai detox shampoo, skipped conditioner and put on this bad boy. Within 4 minutes (as it says on the bottle) I saw immense differences in my hair. I put my hair up into a cotton shirt to dry for a little while, then blow dried on low and it literally took less than 5 minutes to dry my hair! This is how I knew it was such a huge difference because before I used this, I could spend 20 minutes blow drying my hair on high and it would still be damp. My hair was completely dry within 5 minutes on a low setting. I couldn’t believe it! My split ends are way more hydrated, and seem less visible. My hair is silky smooth and so voluminous. I can’t say enough good things about this product."

After washing a second time roughly 4 days later, I tried it again. I definitely noticed a change in the way my hair felt and behaved this time. It felt stronger, shinier and was easier to manage. It had less of that “parched hair” look than usual. I’m excited to continue using this. I love that there is a smaller sized option to try before investing in the full 1.7 fl oz bottle. If you have dry, color treated hair, I strongly recommend this. Fair warning - don’t use too much or it will leave your hair feeling heavy. 2 pumps on my shoulder length hair is enough."

I didn't see a lot of change on my ends, where I need it most. I have very fine, long, wavy hair, and I can say that my hair was NOT weighed down with two pumps (applied to mid-lengths to ends). But, my hair was somewhere between curly and straight and just looked textured and a bit frizzy - not hydrated with plump curls as I was hoping. So, all-in-all, I think this was not a product that was meant for my hair type. Or perhaps I just need to use it for a few more weeks to see results? I was really excited about this one. It has peptides (which I love in skincare), so I expected more for the price tag. I'm giving it 3 stars because it didn't weigh my hair down, it did increase shine, and I think it's possible that I need to keep using it to see results."

It was so silky soft and smooth! It made the styling process so much easier and less of a hassle and my hair genuinely looked so much more shiny and full of life. I’m excited to continue to use this mask (especially because it’s so convenient and simple to do) and see if it leaves a lasting impact on my hair but I would definitely recommend this for anyone looking to improve their hair texture."

			"review_text": "The tldr version: follow the instructions and it’s the type of science that seems like magic.  Typically I don’t write reviews but there were so many incentivized ones and it’s pretty pricey so thought I’d throw my two cents in here.  For context/comparison I use olaplex, the whole system when I feel inspired and just the #3 and #8 when I’m feeling lazy (which admittedly is more often than not) and at $28/bottle per bottle it may technically be cheaper but it’s a multiple bottle system so it gets pretty comparable in price fast.   I’ve used this twice and the first time I used a clarifying shampoo, no conditioner, and then went in with towel dried/ damp hair with about a pump and a half (mid-back length, fine, not very thick, bleached hair). I was a bit worried my hair seemed maybe a bit dry, crunchy? So after the “4 minutes to activate” I added some of my normal hair serum and it felt mostly normal. Air dried, brushed and it looked like how I Wished my hair would air dry (you know, blow dried smooth but still with a bit of body but not like it was blown out). I slept on it and it still looked as good as it did when I went to sleep.   Fast forward to second wash, everything the same, but my hair felt better (likely bc it’s more repaired), so didn’t add anything extra this time. My not-trimmed-in-year hair now looks darn near like I had a fresh trim a month ago.   It’s admittedly weird to not condition and I would love if the K18 had a bit more slip, so definitely pre-brush your hair before shampooing and try not to tangle too much in the drying process, I use a hair towel which helps a lot.   This is honestly so easy to use, takes so much less time than traditional hair masks, and has such visible results, I will definitely buy again."

This is my 2nd bottle and my hair looks so smooth and healthy with this on. After showering I massage this to the tips of my hair up to my roots, wait for 4 minutes, and then proceed with blow-drying my hair. I usually use 1 pump and a half because of the thickness of my hair.  ALSO, it smells amazing! A must buy and would buy again!"

I have shoulder-length hair that needs lots of moisture, but doesn’t necessarily have too much damage or split ends. I used 1.5 pumps of this product and didn’t make a huge different in my hair after the first wash - if anything my hair didn’t look any better since this product requires that you not use conditioner. My hair was limp and not very shiny and my waves and curls were not as pronounced. I tried it another couple of times thinking my opinion might change, but I had the same results. I think for the price point, there may be other products that do a better job."

Its a creamy white lotiony texture treatment; no fragrance at all. I used it right after shower; like mentioned by a company I did not use any conditioner and towel dried my hair. Then applied this treatment all over my hair from root to ends as directed waited for 4 minutes. For Your Information: My hair is very thick, frizzy, gets clumpy and its hard to comb my hair after shower and I tend to loose a lot of hair from pulling and tugging; I need to use conditioner. After 4 minutes wow what is in this small bottle I do not know 2 pumps was enough for my whole hair; It was super easy to comb my hair, tangle free; I do not know its a magic. And I have a baby curls all over my hair, I was so happy to see them back. My hair is frizz free too. Small goes a long way its worth its price its literally a magic. I will buy it again; made me super happy. I absolutely recommend it to everyone."

I typically get a keratin treatment twice a year and I am well overdue for one. After washing my hair I coated my hair with the mask. I did use more than the recommended due to my coarse, thick hair. I put a timer on for 4 minutes, but I have left it on longer so it can truly penetrate my hair. After my first use of the product I noticed how silky smooth my hair was. I was able to keep my blowout for days and it still kept the frizz at bay. I’m on my third use and I’m starting to notice a difference in my hair especially while drying it with a hair dryer. I am able to achieve a salon blow-out with bouncy ends, something I am not always able to easily do on my own. I am excited to see how my hair becomes after a month’s use. I will repurchase again. My hair care health is incredibly important to me as I color and use to heat, which has damaged my hair. This mask has helped bring my hair back to life and has left it soft & silky and smooth. I will definitely be recommending this product to friends and family."

However, this leave in helped detangle and bring softness back to my hair.  This leave in treatment doesn’t have an unpleasant or pleasant smell, it’s pretty subtle and neutral. I do like how a little product goes a long way. However, my hair is very long so it took 3-4 drops to fully work in the product. Because of my hair length I will probably go through this fairly quick considering the bottle isn’t super big.   Overall, this was a decent hair leave in mask and I liked it a lot ! I rate this a 4 because it didn’t give dramatic immediate results and it is pricey for the size, so I’m unsure if I could afford to keep up with replenishing."

It does helps to save time by cutting from 6  to 7 steps we usually take to get our hair done to just 4:  Wash your hair, dry with a towel, apply K18 and wait 4 minutes, then style your hair as you want. In that sense, it is very convenient. Now the only bad thing for me was that since you don't condition and detangle your hair in the shower after applying  k18 is when I try to detalgle and it can become a bit harder to detalgle my hair for me.  Also, I used more than the recommended amount for my hair type and length."

When I learned about the K18 treatment, I was curious as to whether this was the answer to my problem... long story short..that's exactly what it was. I've been into maintaining a blue color in my hair and after using my K18 treatment in my hair I saw a notable difference almost immediately. Definitely will keep her on hand."

And, it comes with well written and easy to follow instructions... so you don’t over do it. Unfortunately,   I didn't follow them precisely and I applied way too much product (4 pumps).  My hair didn’t look that great afterwards as it was over moisturized and looked greasy the next day.   Lesson learned: You just need few pumps and the product will its magic!   The second time I applied 3 pumps and it was good...The third time, I used just two pumps and the results were perfect for my  thick, long hair.   Overall It’s a great hair mask, def rescued my hair and I’ll keep using it to see more results!"

The product made my hair feel very waxy, dirty, and tangly, which was the opposite of the soft, healthy hair I was hoping to experience after using this.   Any “repairing” that this product may have done did not last from wash to wash. Each time I washed my hair was just as bad as the last. I hated the way my hair felt after drying with this product in it, and I really wish that it also had heat protectant in it because the last thing I wanted to do was add more product to my hair when it already felt dirty from this mask.

After using it the first time I instantly saw results and my hair looked and felt hydrated and healthier. After using it the 3rd and 4th time it was like I had new hair. You can tell it looked healthier and hydrated. I have dry ends and oily scalp and it worked with my hair. I would 100% recommend it to friends and family. Lol, my mom even ordered it for herself because she loved how soft and good my hair looked. I call this the magic hair mask haha."

My hair looked really messy and slept in without being able to style this way, as the product instructions say to use on towel dried hair. I will keep trying to see if I can make it work and acknowledge it may be a learning curve type of situation, but for me this was a miss."

Full disclosure, I purchased this mask without knowing much about it. I just really wanted to give it a try. Upon reading the How to Use I was a bit taken back because I realized that I would not be using my conditioner, something that I never do unless, well, I just never do this. I was a bit nervous because my hair does not fair well with a shampoo only look, but I gave it a try...and WOW, I am in love with this product! I've only used it once, as I just purchased it, and I absolutely love the results. After applying the product I wrapped it in a hair towel and left it for about 15 minutes before drying it. After drying my hair I almost didn't even need to use the straightener. My hair feels unbelievably soft and supple, with minimal frizz. The scent is subtle, reminding me of summer. I honestly was not expecting these results. A little goes a long way.  The products that I am currently using works so well that I usually only have to wash my hair every 5-7 days so I will be interesting to see how this new combination holds up. I will be purchasing the larger size now that I know how incredible this product is."

By the time I used this a third time, my hair all over was just so soft and rejuvenated. If I didn’t know better, I would think it was was virgin hair and not overly processed. This product seriously gets better with every time and I have the softest healthiest feeling and looking hair that I have had in at least 10 years. Try this out!!!"

I did that consecutively for four washes and my hair has never felt softer and healthier! I had to do a big chop because my hair was platinum blonde and then I went back dark and I’ve just been doing deep treatment ever since and honestly I did not want to like this product because of the price point but it is worth every single penny because the way my hair has been transformed is next level if you’re on the fence about this I would definitely do it start out with a smaller one at first but I promise you you won’t regret investing in the bigger one!"

I think it was more than 4 mins. The instructions suggest to wear it at least for 4 minutes to activate the formula on the hair. My hair was extremely easy to brush through. The hair mask didnt weigh my hair down. By the way I air dried my hair and it looked less frizzy, usually my hair looks way more frizzy after air drying. as a result my hair looks and feels smooth soft manageable and volumized. the only thing that i didnt like is the scent. it seems very chemical like a hair dye. its quite strong while applying it, thankfully it fades after a few hours and the scent doesn't linger."

My hair was VERY dry; almost tangly; even though I used a leave in conditioner after K18. I didn't want to give up though, because I not only color treat my hair, but I also use a blow dry brush which can damage the hair. After the third time of using it, I saw what everyone else is seeing. My hair is super soft, not weighed down and looking like it is healing from all the heat damage that it has.

I like that I save time washing my hair by not having to condition/do a mask in the shower but I do have to add additional products in order to keep my hair smooth and shiny. Another perk of the mask is that it doesn't take a lot of product. 2 pumps really does work for my long hair- the first few pumps are hard to determine in size because the product is coming out of the tube the same time as air though. Do note that the mask will leave your hands tacky if you're in a rush. Overall I found that my hair is in tact and not worse off than wear it started. K18 seems to help with moisture and hopefully the strength of my hair but it doesn't keep my hair smooth nor shiny after an air dry, unfortunately.

I waited four minutes before styling so the K18Peptide was able to fully absorb into each strand. I then styled my hair as usual and after one use, I noticed a difference.

I noticed an immediate improvement to my hair. It was smoother and over time, my hair didn’t seem as damaged, and my split ends weren’t so noticeable. I began to care for my hair as recommended by Jack, only washing it once a week, and then using K18 every single wash. My scalp became so much healthier without conditioner and all the other products to “help” my hair— really, they were just causing a whole lot of buildup! It was 16 months before I returned to my stylist, and I had a lot of gray grow in during that time. I decided to embrace the gray, which we have been blending through heavy highlights and toning every 7-8 weeks. Despite the increased processing, my hair has been thriving. I do a mask, overnight before washing, and K18 every single wash, followed by a heat protectant and hair oil. I am able to stretch the luxury hair products because I use so little of them. I get regular compliments on my hair and I have purchased many of the “try it” size of K18 to share as gifts. I love it!"

My first thought was that there was no way I could comb this through my hair without conditioner! My hair is a tangled mess without conditioner but just one pump of the product on my long, fine hair allowed me to comb through fairly easily. I let my hair air dry before styling (you only need to wait four minutes though) and it felt smooth, manageable, and healthy. There was bounce and volume in my hair after styling. I have tried using more than one pump but for my hair, it is not necessary. If the product is not evenly dispersed, it will dry to a crispy effect and is just a waste of the product imo. I have also used this product on my daughter's hair which is constantly getting knots. She claims that her hair is much easier to brush through and hurts less than before we started using this on her. FYI, this product is recommended to use the first 4 times consecutively but after that, you can use this product once a week or more sporadically to maintain results. Based on other hair masks, I typically use a bottle this size (larger one) two or three times before running out because of my long hair. This mask really only needs one pump for my hair and is actually a much better value than other products I have used. This product was gifted to me but I have purchased two additional bottles on my own as well. It's that good!"

This product works wonders and I will definitely be adding it to my hair care routine!"

I don’t think this has really reversed any of the damage I’ve done to my hair through bleaching and styling tools. I might recommend this to a friend who doesn’t like conditioner, but otherwise it’s just okay."

The instructions are interesting, you skip conditioner and wring your hair of water before you put it in. You wait 4 minutes and then you can style it. My hair isn’t super damaged but it is very dry. After the first use I was amazed at how it lived up to its claims and more because my hair was shiny bouncy and nourished. It will be something I use a few times a month, but If your hair is very damaged you would use it more often until it is at a healthy state. It is pricy but the ingredients make it so worth it.

For best results, you’re supposed to shampoo your hair with a clarifying shampoo, don’t use any conditioner, and use this after you towel dry your hair. You have to leave it alone for 4 minutes to activate and then you can style per usual. I was a bit skeptical, but after just one use my dry ends definitely felt softer and a bit more manageable. My hair overall looked smoother and shinier which usually doesn’t happen unless I style it. Plus I haven’t been styling my hair since using this and it’s been a time and hair saver since I don’t have to use heat. My hair is on the thin side so one pump is enough for me which should yield about 50 treatments. The product is pricey, but after seeing immediate results, it’s pretty worth it."

The images I am posting are from July, but remain true today. It makes my hair so much softer, stronger, more manageable & less frizzy.  It seems strange not using a conditioner with the mask, but you can use a leave-in after if you really feel like you need it. After the first 4 uses, you only need to use for maintenance. For me that was about once every two weeks. The best part is you don’t have to wait around in the shower to rinse K18 out!!  You just shampoo, rinse & apply the K18. I find it’s easier to comb through my hair with a wide tooth comb after applying the mask & letting it sit for 4 months. Hope this is helpful!!"

Cons:  for this price, I expected this mask to transform my hair and make it extra shiny & soft…but I didn’t notice much difference between K18 and any of my other conditioners/masks (tbf I usually use salon-quality products).  I give K18 4 stars because I love the smell and the unique application, but removing 1 star because at this price I expect amazing, but it only gave me average results for a salon-quality conditioner/mask.

A little goes a long way, so that will help this container last you for awhile. I waited in anticipation for my hair to dry to see the effect of this mask. I was immediately pleased with the results. After one use I can already see that my hair looked healthier. I blow out my hair fairly often and I have some split ends, but my hair looked quite healthy after use. My hair was softer and smoother and didn’t look dry. While this mask is on the pricier side, I felt like my hair looked as if I got a salon treatment.

I get balayages and baby highlights and obviously the bleach takes a toll on my hair and really does some damage but I do love the look. My hair from the bleach has now been damaged, dry, breaks easily, is frizz prone and not smooth, and does not feel strong does not feel strong. I was so intrigued by this hair mask and by the science behind it that I had to give it a try to see if it could restore my hair. The K18Peptide is a molecular breakthrough proven to reverse hair damage in just 4 minutes by applying the hair mask to towel dried hair that has only been shampooed but skipping conditioner and applying just one to two pumps to hair depending on hair length and thickness. After just one single use my hair felt significantly softer, smoother, less frizzy, and stronger! I swear it really did after just a single use in just 4 minutes! I couldn’t believe it! It’s a miracle! My hair feels and looks so much healthier too! I love it! I’m going to continue to use for first 4-6 washes as it says in directions and then it says every 3-4 washes as needed. I know I’ll continue to see improvements but couldn’t be happier with the results I’m already feeling and seeing in my hair and excited that I have found a product that I can use so I can bleach my hair to my liking but also have my hair looking and feeling healthy. I highly highly recommend! The results are amazing!"

I used only 2 pumps for my first try on my long hair, like almost touching waste long and it does almost instantly feels like my hair has been conditioned with a de tangling product. After waiting for the product to activate, brushing got to be super easy and smooth. Hair felt heavier, thicker, but still very clean feeling, without noticeable texture change or feeling product in my hair. No weighing down! It adds 100% shine and makes hair silky soft, heavier fuller looking hair that are so pleasant to touch. I was big on Olaplex but honestly from the first try I think K18 might be ahead of it in results. Totally recommend to anyone, I think this one is truly a miracle worker."

My hair feels softer, silkier, it isn’t as frizzy. I would say it’s shinier too! That crunchy feeling is gone by at least 70% & it dries down naturally much more tame than it did pre-this mask. Overall, been talking to my hair colorist non stop about this & how I can preserve all the hard work & money we’ve put into my head. Is it cheap? No, but i spend so much money getting my hair done it would be a crime to not keep this in my hair routine to preserve the thousands I’m putting into it! 10/10 - never want to run out!!!"

			"review_text": "Okay, I do not normally write reviews but I kinda just have to about this product. To give some backstory, I was dumb and thought my hair was invincible and got into hair color. September 2021 was the first time I dyed my hair with box dye and my hair didn’t react at all. It was still extremely healthy and felt like my virgin hair. So I assumed my hair was a special case and could withstand anything… so, I decided to get creative with my hair and went absolutely crazy. After my first dye, from mid October 2021 - early February 2022, I bleached my hair 5 times, dyed my hair with 4 Arctic fox colors and 3 box dyes and one professional dye from Sally’s, used the homemade color remover method of dish soap, developer, baking soda and purple shampoo probably 20 times… if not more. It wasn’t until it was too late that I realized how dead and fried and destroyed my hair was. It was so bad that my hair would stick out straight in the air when I’d pick up a small section, rather than bouncing and falling down like healthy hair does. To fix my mistake, I tried to use MANY different deep masks, hair hyaluronic acid and olaplex and those barely made a dent in the damage I caused… so I bought the mini size of K-18 and just finished 5 washes with it (I probably have one more wash left but I was too excited to wait to write this review). After the first wash my hair felt exponentially better than it had since my first dye. And after my 5th wash, I can confidently say this product has totally saved my hair. Of course it’s not completely healed, but I’d say it’s 80% back to it’s “virgin” state. I’d say after a couple more washes it’ll be almost back to it’s completely healthy state. My hair is a couple inches from my shoulders but very dense so I have to section my hair into 2 sections and do 2 pumps for each one to feel properly coated.   The takeaway from this review is don’t be stupid like I was, but also this product is an absolute miracle worker and 100% worth the price."

My hair is waist length and highly damaged from bleach, I knew for sure I would end up with knots and tangles. I left it in for four minutes without combing or detangling, then after letting it process I combed my hair & it was so easy to style. My hair felt incredibly soft with less frizz, and now 3 treatments in I’m fully addicted.

I notice my ends being more flexible withouth breaking off and its given my ends new life after one use already.i also feel like my ends get softer the longer I use it for. Definatly recommend.

After my first application of k18 I had a significant decrease in hair loss. When I washed 3 days later, I was shocked that I don’t have strands and stands falling out to set aside to trash. When I combed it out later, I had literally almost nothing coming out! Now after using this for 5 full washes I am back to what I consider normal hair shedding (extremely minimal) and my hair is feeling so healthy!!!

I also left it for 4 minutes before styling or using other products, but I wanted to use it by itself to see the specific results.  I use 2 pumps since I have thick hair and a lot of it. The technology behind this product is very cool and innovative, as their patented molecule enters and repairs the broken keratin chain inside the hair. This helped my hair look and feel stronger, and also helped with frizz and dryness (I have thick wavy hair so I get lots of frizz). I don’t have extremely damaged hair in the sense that I don’t bleach it but I do use hot tools regularly so I do have some damage and I love the repairing effect that I get from this product. It also helps my wavy strands look more defined and stronger. I also like the pump as it is very easy to measure how much product you need and not to overboard. Overall I am really enjoying this product as I can see results even after using it only once so this has become a staple on my hair care routine. I have already recommended this product to all my friends."

I used this after shampooing, skipped the conditioner like the directions stated, and left my hair alone for 4 minutes before following up with my heat and styling products. The results are surprising. My hair is very soft and actually feels repaired. I did have to use 3-4 pumps instead of just 1 dime size pump: I usually don’t notice a significant difference with products like this, however, this is definitely pricier so if you have a lot of hair like me make sure this is something you really want to try!"
