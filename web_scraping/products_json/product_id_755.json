They asked me if I was using anything new, and I said no because I've been using IT for years, but the next morning, as I was getting ready, I was thinking this is a new formula. I went the same day and bought a different brand of foundation. It went on better, looked better, and after 3 or 4 days my face had completely stopped peeling."

Also, since itu2019s SPF 40, I donu2019t have to apply sunscreen separately which saves me time in the morning, one less step in skincare/ makeup routine. The pump tube dispenses just the right amount of foundation which is enough for the full face. Itu2019s natural matte finish is great both for no-makeup makeup look and full glam look. My skin texture has improved since I started using this foundation. The CC+ cream has the benefit of skincare along with makeup."

Iu2019m going to try it using different primers, powders, & setting sprays to see what works best with it.

It reduced my T-Zone shine greatly while providing  a natural matte finish. I never got to try the previous formula, but this new product proves its cult status. I have slight redness and pores on my face and noticed that the foundation did a great job hiding redness and blurring my pores. I will say the only thing a user should be wary about is the actual thickness of the foundation itself. I think it applies best with a damp beauty sponge or in very thin layers depending on coverage needs. It will feel heavy and mask-like if over applied. I found this product to be quite multi-functional and used for concealer and spot coverage both which worked well. If you do plan on using this as an under eye concealer, make sure your eyes are moisturized before applying. Overall I really liked this product. The SPF is always a welcome addition plus it didnu2019t leave a white cast."

It doesnu2019t lift my foundation or tinted moisturizer, which is always a concern for this type of cream that lays on top of a base. The formula actually seems to last on my skin through the day, despite the heat and even when I donu2019t set it with a setting powder. I would recommend a setting spray to maintain the glowy finish and color if you have an event or if you want to make absolutely certain that it will last all day/night. I really like this blush and it is a first for me with this brand. Recommend!  CC+ Natural Matte Foundation  I really love the coverage of this product for days when my skin is less than great. I wanted it to work so badly for me, but it seems like I have to heavily moisturize before use and then apply and then set with a setting spray to get it to look mostly okay even then, it is hard to make it work for my skin type. I have dry skin and this foundation really wants to emphasize that when I donu2019t go through all the steps mentioned above, which is difficult over the Summer. I sweat under all the moisturizer! I look forward to trying this again in cooler weather, but I worry that my skin will be in a drier state then at the same timeu2026. The coverage is top notch though! If you have an oily or normal skin type this might just be your full coverage holy grail!"

I live in a high heat humid area and my makeup did not sweat or melt off within a few hours of application as usual. If you're searching for a foundation that does it all, look no further. The skin loving ingredients and SPF 40 has saved me time and steps in my skincare/makeup routine. It smoothed out my imperfections, covers my blemishes, and evened out my skin tone without feeling heavy or cakey. I have oily skin and did not experience any shine throughout the day just a beautiful matte finish. The color stays true throughout the day and I have not noticed any oxidizing or fading. I love that it has skin-loving ingredients like collagen, peptides, and hyaluronic acid. The SPF 40 is the cherry on top. It does have the SPF sunscreen smell but nothing overpowering and fades quickly. I have sensitive skin and it did not break me out or clog my pores. I have also noticed a wide range of shades which is nice to see."

The formula is very matt, and you definitely need to put moisturizer on first. It provides  excellent full coverage and stays on all day. It felt very lightweight and comfortable to wear. I have sensitive skin, and it wasn't irritating. Because it's so matt, I thought it slightly emphasized my fine lines. When I applied it with a beauty blender, it provided the right amount of coverage without being too thick. I also found that I could layer in certain areas to get more coverage without being cakey by applying a light application. It's a very good lightweight matt foundation with excellent coverage and sunscreen."

I liked how there were lots of colors to choose from, so it was easy finding the right shade for me. The pump also makes it easy to get the product out in the right amount. Though I have a lot of foundation left, I can feel that the tube bottle will make it easy to get all of the product out without wasting too much, unlike other solid foundation bottles.

The matte finish is ideal for controlling shine, but it can emphasize dry patches and texture if youu2019re not careful. For the best results, I recommend applying a good moisturizer or hydrating primer first to ensure a smoother finish. While itu2019s a solid choice for those with oily skin, it may require some extra prep for a flawless look."

This foundation stayed matte until I washed it off in the evening! It did not streak or run down my face after a 5-mile ruck with just this foundation and setting spray! My face was pouring sweat and nothing came off except the area my hat was rubbing against.

The formula is comparable to a leading luxury moisturizer, offering a lightweight feel that blends smoothly into the skin, making it perfect for daily wear. As someone with combination skin, I appreciated that it didn't accentuate any dry patches and provided a natural glow. For those with oily skin, the matte finish and full coverage are impressive, with the added bonus of SPF 40 for sun protection. Although I had to color correct the shade, the product's versatility allows for both light and full coverage applications. Overall, this CC cream is a fantastic choice for anyone looking for a hydrating, protective, and lightweight foundation with buildable coverage."

Fortunately, this shade is a tad too dark for my skin tone. I attempted to make it work as best I could. I will need to visit the store soon to select my correct shade because I adore this CC cream and have noticed that it does not smudge at all.

I was shocked when yeah this actually works! It kept me matte & I didnu2019t need a lot, full coverage without feeling heavy or looking cakey, and blended out flawlessly with a sponge. I revived tan cool and it was a little dark, I find that foundations from this brand tend to always pull too warm so I did have to mix in some blue & white pigment from LA Girl to even it out. I highly recommend and will continue to use.   I received this product complimentary from Bzzagent for testing purposes."

First of all, if you have an oily face like me this foundation is for you. I have yet to find a cc cream that doesn't make me more oily. This IT Cosmetics CC cream helped keep the shine away and provided the right amount of coverage. Enough to make my skin look good and even but not too much. It gave that natural makeup look. I love the way this feels on and it's easy to apply and blend in. It has spf 40 so I no longer need to also apply sunscreen. I appreciate that it has hyaluronic acid. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because the tan warm color is muuuuch darker in person than how it appears in the picture online."

I received this product, along with the IT Cosmetics Glow With Confidence Sun Blush in the shade sunlit 10, in exchange for my honest review.   I have been on the search for the perfect CC cream for sometime and this product sadly did not pass the ultimate test for me:  I was waiting to see how it held up during a night out with a full face of make, on vacation in hot, humid Caribbean weather. I live in New England where we do have several months of weather that is almost as hot and just as humid.   First, I was never able to fully blend the product into my skin. No matter which primer I used it with,  it just seemed to sit on top of my skin which also meant it just sat on top of all of my fine lines / wrinkles. Even with a setting spray, this quickly melted off my face leaving me looking worse than if I had absolutely no make up on it all.  I do love that the IT Cosmetics CC+ Natural Matte Foundation with SPF 40  contains skin balancing serum and of course, a high SPF. I also love the wide range of shades and the Fair Warm did match perfectly."

At first, it took some trial and error to figure out ways to apply the product and not have it highlight my acne scars or pores. But if you find the right amount of product (a little goes a long way) and blend well, it provides great coverage and has a nice overall finish. One thing to note - I wouldnu2019t rely solely on this product for SPF because it does provide medium to full, buildable coverage. So if you only used this product (without a separate sunscreen base), it might look cakey. Iu2019ve been using korean sunscreen as my first layer, then applying the CC cream on top. I finish with a bit of Laura Mercier translucent powder and viola, my face makeup is done for the day and lasts 10+ hours."

Overall, I was impressed with its performance. Designed as a full-coverage foundation, it excels in providing a matte finish that effectively balances out redness, skin imperfections, and fine lines. The inclusion of a skin-balancing serum within the formula is a notable bonus, offering added skincare benefits alongside its makeup capabilities.  In my experience, the foundation worked exceptionally well to cover and blur some of my more persistent skin issues, such as redness and acne. However, I did find it a bit too heavy for everyday wear. To address this, I experimented with mixing the foundation with a moisturizer, which thinned it out and made it more comfortable for daily use without losing all of the coverage.   The added SPF 40 is a significant advantage, providing essential sun protection. While I wouldnu2019t rely on it as a sole sunscreen replacement, it's reassuring to have that extra layer of defense integrated into my makeup routine.  I appreciated the skincare-focused ingredients, which aligned with my desire for makeup products that offer more than just cosmetic benefits. If you're looking for a full-coverage, matte foundation that also prioritizes skin health, the CC+ Cream Natural Matte Foundation is a solid choice."

A little dime sized amount provides the full coverage for me, and the color blends extremely well.

As I have gotten older, my skin type has gone from primarily dry to combination (oily t-zone with drier portions of the face). That has definitely been an adjustment, and finding products that suit both of those needs has been hard. But I found that this product has exactly what I need: a formula that will not crack and accentuate dry patches in addition to not slip and slide off the oily portions of my face. I have been loving using it lately, and it has honestly made me excited about makeup again!"

Although it is full coverage, it is not heavy or cakey; it applies cleanly and smoothly. It's definitely buildable,  but I only required one thin layer to achieve the coverage I desired. Aside from the coverage, I was most impressed by the SPF factor that is difficult to find in foundations. In addition, the expiration date is clear and visible on the packaging so that you are constantly reminded  of when the active ingredients are no longer active. The only drawback is the recommended 2-hour reapplication for maximum effectiveness...reapplication was difficult to remember throughout the day. Nonetheless, I would definitely recommend this foundation for an everyday clean and natural finish, especially in the summer."

With the original product, I was in the shade u201cfair.u201d With the matte, I also tried u201cfairu201d and swatched the lighter shades due to my general paleness, and they all came out orange on me.

I always wear mascara and lip gloss/lip stick but I just donu2019t like the way foundation feels or looks on my face. I just stopped wearing it completely because I was tired of wasting money on foundations that didnu2019t feel right. I got this to try and LOVE it. I have super read cheeks all the time, idk why but I just do, and my face is always splotchy looking. This did a great job in my opinion of hiding that. It went on smoothly and doesnu2019t look cakey. The pictures I added are just the foundation and I have some very light cream blush on my cheeks (it cosmetics sun cream blush in Sun Blossom) and my skin looks great. I also used a brush to apply this! For reference Iu2019m 28F and I have combo skin that breaks out super easy. I have worn this multiple times now and my skin doesnu2019t have any zits or break outs yet! Usually if my skin doesnu2019t like a product itu2019s breaking out next day.

It is easy to apply, and since this is a full coverage cream, you only need one full coat with a little spot covering to get a flawless and beautiful results. I really enjoy the cream base as I think it applies very well for combination skin, such as my own, it helps to not over dry or cause extra greasy wear throughout the day. My favorite thing is the SPF inclusion, since I have fair skin, I rely on products to have sun protection. This product allows you to have the best of both worlds flawless finished look and sun protection! I also like the ingredient list and find this to be on the cleaner side, which is a major plus for me. Overall, I think it applies well last all day and truly delivers a perfect matte look.

Perhaps if I had a darker shade, it may have worked better and not looked so flakey and , but this item was a big fail for me.  It is very, very matte and also felt heavy and pastey to me.

The only positive is the two newer light shades which match my skin tone way better than the previous 'fair' shade. Not useful though as the new formulation looks so terrible that I will not be using it. Time to find a new cc cream, unfortunately!"

Now it is so horrible that itu2019s not worth a penny. Now: (1) itu2019s not blendable, (2) itu2019s so dry it turns into powder on your face right after application, (3) has a strong disgusting chemical smell, (4) settles into lines and pores and makes every skin imperfection even more pronounced, making you look much older than you really are, (5) it makes you look and feel like youu2019re wearing some kind of dreadful PLASTER on your face - not breathable and very pore-clogging. I am done with this company. Will never buy any of their products again. Literally, any $10 drugstore matte CC cream is far better than this newly re-formulated piece of toxic garbage.

The company has now re-formulated the product to be less matte and it is now u201cnaturalu201d but not oil free. It also has the carcinogenic chemical SPF. Why a company as great as IT Cosmetics would take their absolute best product (probably best-selling too) and turn it into total garbage is beyond me. They just lost a long-time, loyal customer. I have now switched to KOSAS organic, skin-improving, non-comedogenic foundation with mineral SPF which is also REEF SAFE. And honestly, it is a pretty awesome foundation. Oh well.

Application was pretty easy, I applied with my fingers since it's a thicker formula, because of the sunscreen, and I wanted to warm it up a little to blend better into my skin. It didn't tug or pull, and although it's high coverage, it blends out really well so even if you get a shade off from your own, there's a good chance for it to look good. The coverage lasted all day, and my skin felt really nice and not dry at all, a huge plus because the weather was still on the cold and dry side when I got to try it out, a few weeks ago. The only reason I gave it 4 stars was that the color is a bit dull, sort of flat, slightly, slightly veering towards a grey undertone. So it's definitely matte, but a very matte type of matte, if you want a little color dimension you might need to mix a little of something else into it. Overall, I definitely loved everything else about it, loved that it had sunscreen, but not sure if I would repurchase just because I'd like a little more brightness in the color."

That is until I discovered IT Cosmetics Natural Matte CC+ Cream with SPF 40. This cream has been nothing short of a revelation for me, and I'm eager to share my experience with others who might be navigating similar skin concerns.First and foremost, the coverage is impeccable. The Natural Matte finish of this CC+ Cream is perfect for those who, like me, prefer a more subdued, shine-free look. It blends seamlessly into the skin, providing a uniform coverage that effectively masks the vitiligo spots without feeling heavy or cakey. The range of shades available is commendable, allowing me to find a match that compliments my skin tone beautifully, enhancing my natural complexion rather than masking it.The aspect of this CC+ Cream that truly sets it apart for me is its SPF 40 sunscreen protection. Sun exposure can exacerbate vitiligo, causing the light spots to become more pronounced. However, since incorporating this cream into my daily routine, I've noticed a significant reduction in the severity of my light spots. The high SPF content not only protects my skin from further sun damage but has also contributed to making the spots less severe over time, a benefit I hadn't found in any other product before.Another highlight is the formula's skin-loving ingredients. IT Cosmetics is known for infusing their products with high-quality, beneficial components, and this CC+ Cream is no exception. It's hydrating without being greasy, which is a fine line to walk for any skincare product. My skin feels nourished and soft, with a healthy, natural glow that lasts throughout the day.The wearability factor is also impressive. It stays put all day without needing touch-ups, even in hot, humid conditions. This longevity, combined with its matte finish and protective properties, makes it an"

I am surprisingly impressed with this product.  Even though the foundation has SPF it doesnu2019t irritate my skin and feels light weight on the skin. With SPF 40, this CC cream provides decent sun protection. It's a nice  for everyday wear.  The coverage is fantastic. It manages to even out my skin tone and cover any imperfections without feeling heavy or cakey. It's buildable, so you can achieve anything from a natural look to full coverage. However, the formula texture is a little dense and quick to absorb so you need to apply it quickly. For me, I use setting spray to help. As a person with combination skin, I appreciate the natural matte finish. It controls shine without making my skin look flat or dull. Plus, this Foundation blurs the look of pores; it doesn't settle into fine lines or pores, giving a smooth appearance.   I found on the website, Its cosmetics says this CC Cream lasts for 16 hours, but I feel it stays nicely for 8 to 9 hours then it starts to change a little.  Plus point, this CC cream is infused with skincare ingredients like hyaluronic acid, peptides, and niacinamide, which help to hydrate, smooth, and improve the overall health of your skin with continued use. The full coverage color correcting, serum foundation with a built-in primer, sun protection, all-in-one, multi-tasking, IT Cosmetics CC+ Cream Natural Matte Foundation with SPF 40 is a hard to pass product for combination and oily skin. Whether you're looking for coverage, sun protection, or skincare benefits, this CC cream has you covered. It is good to have for daily use or travel"

I really enjoyed using this product, appreciated the 40spf, and its staying power. The cons I did not find it hydrating. In fact I felt like it highlighted any dry spot on my face. Ensure you are fully moisturized before using, sometimes I even needed to blend in more moisture after applying. I would have given it 5 stars if it werenu2019t for how dry I felt it made my skin look and the extra steps needed to correct that. IT cosmetics is a brand I really enjoy, they consistently make quality products, and this foundation is no different. I think if you have oily skin this would be the best product for you."

I have super oily skin, year-round and nothing I do keeps the oil at bay for more than a few hours.

This, by far, kept my skin from shinning like a disco-ball more than anything else I have tried. I typically apply my makeup around 6:30 am before I head to work, and don't wash it off until about 7:00 pm. Throughout the day, I keep up on blotting powder and mattifying sprays to keep the oil under control- applying both 3-4 times a day. Not only did I not have to break out the setting spray, but I didn't even have to apply the blotting powder until late afternoon, and that was just for a quick touch-up!  I've been wearing this product just about everyday since receiving it, and it has held up during busy work weeks, evenings out, weekends at the coast (including one very humid weekend), and I can honestly say I'm incredibly impressed by its ability to hold up under just about every circumstance. * Note- I received this product in exchange for an honest review."

I like that I was able to put one or two pumps on my palm of my hand and it covers my entire face. I donu2019t feel like it is super heavy on my face when I mix it with my whole other makeup routine.

While the quality wasn't bad, the foundation itself just felt a bit too heavy for my liking.  Nice Coverage and Hydration On the plus side, the coverage was thorough. I also appreciated the hydrating ingredients like hyaluronic acid and aloe vera.   Too Thick for My Taste  However, the foundation's thickness was a dealbreaker for me.  It felt a bit heavy on my face, and I had a hard time achieving a truly natural look. I found that I needed a very light application to avoid looking mask-like.

I hate the dark uneven spots I have, and wrinkles that have developed with age and most foundations I have tried tend to settle right into the lines and pores accentuating them. However I was very surprised by this product not only did the smallest amount (seriously like the size of a pea) cover my entire face giving it a smooth even look it also did not become settled in to the areas I want to cover the most Add to that the fact it is also a sunscreen preventing further skin damage and this product has become the Holy Grail of my makeup routine and albeit it may be a little on the pricey side I promise it is worth every penny and honestly with the littlest amount needed it will last for a long time and probably save you money in the long run. Seriously this should be a staple in all womenu2019s makeup routines because not only is it good for aging women the protection is good for women who are younger but want to age gracefully."

It not only protects your skin with SPF 40, but it also color corrects, provides full coverage, and has a formula that includes a skin-balancing serum that doubles as a primer.  I tried it initially with nothing on my face to see how it worked, and I was blown away by the immediate coverage and elimination of redness. The formula is light, creamy, and spreads nicely onto the skin, leaving it looking matte, natural, and smooth. It is not at all cakey or overwhelming, and even on my aging skin, it doesn't settle into my fine lines or make me look older.  I have been using this product every day since then and even during my workouts, and I have noticed that it lasts without budging. This is hands down my new favorite foundation, and I would recommend it to anyone with aging (37) combo skin like mine. Additionally, the shade Fair Beige (c) was a perfect match for my skin tone."

Big mistake, I learned a little goes a long way with this product. So the second time, I applied it with a wet blender sponge and like I said the first time, 2-3 pumps are more than enough. Once I got the hang of the application process came the rest... So during the day I found the product on different items, my clothes, my hands, my mask, my phone... it was a nightmare. By the end of the day I'm sure I didn't have any product left on my face. I also felt like my face felt become more oily as the day progressed. If you're going to wear this for a short period of time I think its ok, to wear all day not so much. For the record I wore this during a 12 hour work shift."

Color correcting, pore refining, full coverage, and skin balancing serum, plus spf sunscreen. I wish this matched my skin a little better but I plan to use it for contouring along with a lighter color in order to look closer to my skin color. When I used it the coverage was good but I felt like it needed to use a lot and it didnu2019t blend very well. On my skin it felt dry not creamy. Almost like it dried out and wasnu2019t fresh.

I have combination skin and am in my late 30u2019s with smooth skin and a few lines and freckles. The bottle has a pushbutton applicator that neatly dispenses a drop at a time which I really like. Makes application cleaner if using fingers in a rush AND uses less product. Considering this stuff is $47 dollars a bottle, that's ideal. Application goes on smoothly and coverage is buildable. I felt some areas of my skin were a bit dry (flakey/cakey), even after exfoliation and moisturizing. So for those areas, I started mixing a drop of the foundation 50/50 with lotion which took care of the issue. I didnu2019t break out or have any rashes during use. Longevity was better than expected. I tried it alone, with primer, and with powder on top. I tested the sunscreen by mowing my yard in makeup lol. It lasted! Though I would prefer a formulation without sunscreen. The shade u2018Medium Coolu2019 was even natural, without making me look like some crazy orange person. Best of all, my dark circles were covered better than anything Iu2019ve used!! Thank you for that!! Overall, this stuff worked well for me and despite the price, Iu2019ll be buying some more when mine runs out."

The smell of sunscreen quickly wafted past my nose as I pumped the creamy foundation onto the back of my hand. You can apply with a brush for medium to full coverage, or blend withyour fingers for lighter coverage. Opting for the latter, I spread half a pump onto my face with my fingers. I learned the hard way that it's easy to apply too much product, so I started small and added more if it felt necessary. It immediately mattified upon application, which seems great for the normal to oily types. I used a setting spray to get a slightly dewier finish. Other than that, it minimized pores and facial redness pretty easily and with little product. The matte finish draws attention away from surface texture that would otherwise be highlighted by a shinier or dewier finish. Unfortunately, it clung to dry patches. Ultimately, it felt more like a foundation than a CC cream. I didn't really feel the skincare elements that CC creams claim to have. It also didn't mix well with my moisturizing primer, so I would definitely only use this on hydrated skin that is either freshly washed or is prepped with moisturizer.   pros: - covers redness easily - minimizes pores - matte finish de-emphasizes surface texture - good for normal/oily skin - SPF protection  cons: - emphasizes dry patches - not very moisturizing - does't play well with primers"

            "review_text": "I am so grateful to BzzAgent for sending me this CC+ Natural Matte Cream Foundation for free in exchange for my opinion. This review is honest & authentic for this foundation, based on my combo/oily, acne prone, textured skin. This is a VERY matte foundation, and it dries VERY quickly. I advise applying it in sections. I applied it onto the back of my hand & mixed it with some blue+white foundation adjusters as I am a fair/light skintone with neutral-olive undertones, and I noticed immediately how thick the consistency is due to how much adjuster I had to add. It isn't unusual for full coverage tinted moisturizers to have thicker consistencies, however this also oxidizes as it dries down & it does so very quickly. I had to go in with a lighter concealer to even my complexion out, but that's just a shade issue-I am curious to see if there's a shade I can actually use without too much mixing effort. I wish they had a better shade range.  Now, I work in a restaurant as a cashier/waitress/cook, and I've worn this foundation while working a double shift (10am-12am, opened & closed) and I didn't have to touch up as much throughout the day, which I'm usually an oily/sweaty mess within 2 hours. I have some dry patches around my nostril, where my nose was recently pierced 8 weeks ago, and I just had to exfoliate really well in that area & carefully hydrate specific areas of my face. This foundation does seem to sit better on my skin when I have time to let my skincare fully set, but I have mixed it with a hydrating primer serum right after washing my face without any other skincare-it kept it from drying as quickly, which I appreciated.   TLDR; great for overly oily skin, a little more effort for combo/dry skin, but I'm sure this will be a great summer date night foundation. It handles my 12+ hr work days beautifully. Dries quickly, can be used for experimenting + mixing with other products to adjust to the different needs of my skin. Needs a better shade range."

I have had some bad experiences with IT cosmetics in the past which made me not want to seek them out, mostly involving the shade range. When I saw this product had some more shades, including one I felt more comfortable in, I still had doubts but decided to try it. Well, I can say when I'm  wrong because this was such a good match to me, shade wise. I also enjoyed the formula - I avoided cc creams since it wasn't matte and this formula was and it didn't make me look 'dry'. I liked how it looked on me a lot, and I did get compliments because of it, which helped.   However, I don't think it works well with EVERY primer I have, but that's a 'results may vary' thing. I also don't think this is best if you wear face masks often like I do, unless you prep and set really well. I have several instances when my foundation is basically on the inside of my mask and not on me. If you plan on wearing this, set your CC cream well or just wear it when you're not going to wear a mask. Besides that, I really do like it and I will continue to wear it."

I was dealing with a pretty bad  breakout and it covered it so well - I didn't even need concealer!! It is a matte finish, but it's not too matte. As far as i've noticed, it has not broken me out any. My only con about this foundation is it did seem a bit too heavy for my skin. I'm used to lighter foundations / skin tints. I would wear this more on days when I need a more full coverage look."

            "review_text": "When compared to a BB cream the consistency is thicker and more mattifying.  It is also more opaque, therefore it is less forgiving when it comes to color matching. Medium, buildable coverage. Works well with other products and it is long lasting.  I love the packaging, pump is the most convenient. A small amount gives great coverage.  It dries up quickly,  I suggest applying on small areas and blending immediately. Fingertips application worked best for me. I have combination skin, my t-zone needed constant powder retouching. I would not recommend it for dry skin,  unless it is heavily moisturized first. No fragrance. Applied in small amount feels like skin, but a layer of additional sunscreen is needed in my opinion. I tried color light-medium warm, I find it a litle bit pale for me. I will be looking for a better match next time I visit the store."

It is definitely matte, but doesn't feel dry or heavy. You can use their color matching on their website to find your correct shade. IT Cosmetics is a great brand and I absolutely love their original line so I was excited to give their new matte version a try.Always a bonus to have SPF 40! The matte version is good for those who have oily skin or lean oily during the warmer months."

I also have to say the application was very smooth which I appreciate because some products don't go on well. The cc cream is a great color corrector, but the fact that it has SPF in it to protect you while outdoors, is a huge plus. Make sure to apply 15 minutes prior to going outside. The only negative thing here for me is that the color was not a good color for me, must've messed up on the color match. This color is at least two shades lighter than I need it to be. I like how it felt so much on my skin, that I will seek it out in my correct color. I do recommend you purchase it! Sometimes when I put tinted products, with SPF on my face, not long after my face gets a little bit itchy. I didn't have this problem with this product, and I don't normally have sensitive skin either, so the fact that this product didn't make me have that same response after applying it, was great."

For a CC cream I was pretty impressed. I have combination skin that is quite oily in my T-zone. I had the product on for 10 hours. With the exception of my nose, which gets VERY OILY, it still looked great by end of day, but I intentionally didnu2019t touch up my makeup during the day so I could see how this performs. I will definitely re-powder my nose at midday and in the evening (if going out) to keep oiliness away, but Iu2019m impressed that my forehead and chin didnu2019t get oily AT ALL. This is a great alternative to my full coverage designer foundation."

The coverage is medium-full and looks so good on. I typically use the Beauty Blender skin tint or the NARS Light reflecting. So the consistency of this foundation is a little thicker than the Beauty Blender foundation. But the wear of this was was great! I wore it from 10am to 10pm, with no problems of it disappearing or getting patchy. Iu2019ve never been one to use the IT cosmetics foundations, but this one will be a staple for me.

Unfortunately, for my current dry and flaking winter skin (especially since having begun Tret a few months ago), it simply was too matte of a finish for me and tended to collect on my dry patches.

I do love how buildable this product is, however, and I look forward to trying this product again in the summer - once my skin stops throwing a tantrum and the humidity rises! Ultimately, though, there were enough things I *did* like about this product/formula that it has led me to look into other IT Cosmetics products similar to this to possibly replace my current med-high coverage foundation with something on the lighter side.

My skin is a combination of normal, dry spots, and oily T zone. I know the joys of being me lol. This foundation does a great job of keeping my T zone under control, while keeping my normal skin supple, I did notice that i have to be extra careful in taking care of my dry patches before hand but nothing that i didnt have to deal with before. It does help balance my rosasea, specially when I go for fuller coverage. The only thing I dont love is that it is not a long lasting foundation, specially if you will be out and about. If I wanted to last all day I had to use a primer and a setting spray, which I rather not do. Or I had to do touch ups through the day."
