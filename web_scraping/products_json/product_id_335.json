But it was hard to work it, itu2019s not something that you can just take on your brush and blend, because pigmented you have to be careful in loading up your brush equally and then put it on your face. Even then it still moves my foundation. Iu2019ve tried it before and after powder, after powder works better for me but still can get patchy. It also clung to dry and texture on your skin. I have pitted scars and PIE due to acne and i felt like it magnified my hyperpigmentation and scars more, but is otherwise somewhat blurring on the clear parts of my face. This was such a bummer because i seriously loved the shades and wanted to use the product so bad."

The price for value of this set is amazing! I like the inclusion of Jubilee as it's not one I'd have tried otherwise and I don't think I'd ever need more than this mini size. Dancing queen is gorgeous, but I do have to go a tad light handed as I'm very fair, but I'm sure it would look gorgeous on others with a darker complexion. Now Spiced Latte is gorgeous, a perfect fall warm brown. it is nude but still such a nice blush color and so easily wearable! But Red Velvet is what I bought the set for! I love a red blush, on my fair skin I can get that perfect Snow White/Disney Princess blush. I only wish this was a full size too... I do hope it eventually comes out as a full size!!!"

These are highly pigmented and a little goes a long way. The colors can go very lightly but will easily build to an intense color if you want.  The value of this set is phenomenal and would be a fantastic gift. I love the cute minis, I wouldn't be surprised if we see the 2 new released shades become permanent editions to her blush family. I'm very happy with this purchase."
