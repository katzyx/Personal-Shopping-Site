It had all the ingredients on the box so no need to open before viewing the contents.  It says it is made with amino acids, omegas 3,6 & 9, prebiotics and vitamins B3, B5 and E which are all amazing vitamins for the skin.  I wanted this product for my 6 year old to start a good skincare routine and because the winters here in Canada really dry out her skin.  You only need a very small amount and I like the pump action as it makes it easier for my daughter to use.  It has a mild but pleasant scent and feels quite thick on the skin, comparable to a night time moisturiser for adults. My daughter loves it as it makes her skin feel very soft.  No cons and I highly recommend this product if youu2019re looking for a child- friendly moisturiser."

The texture is smooth, luxurious and not oily. It is extremely lightweight, gentle, hydrating for dry winter skin, leaving the skin residue-free. Even after a few weeks use, both my daughter and mom commented their skin is more hydrated, less itchy and glowey. The scent is also very nice, it smells exactly like sweet peaches. Such a genuinely fresh and luxurious peachy scent. The scent is not overpowering nor overwhelming. This cream is also formulated with so many vitamins and minerals. Very lovely and I highly recommend it for all ages. I received this product for free from Influenster in exchange for my honest opinion."

I prefer scented products and this one smells so good - peach scented and not too strong.  It contains prebiotics and vitamins B3 as well as squalane and jojoba oil. I had noticed that all three of my childrenu2019s skin have been getting drier as the weather changes and I apply this morning and night and their skin is much smoother and hydrated. Now I canu2019t wait to try some more products from this brand like their shampoos and body washes."

Saves a lot of mess and from having germy kiddo hands in a tub of moisturizer. The peach scent is nice and not overwhelming or too fake smelling.  That said, I do not think I'd ever go out of my way to purchase this product on my own. At $34 CAD this product is overpriced for what it is. As far as effectiveness, I think Aveeno lotions work just as well (if not better) for a fraction of the price. This entire line of kids stuff seems to be more of a gimmick than anything."

This great moisturizer contains a blend of Omegas and vitamins, giving her skin great antioxidant protection. Plus, it's vegan and gluten-free, which makes me feel good for using it for my kids. It has a peach smell which is nice but i wish they had the scent free options. Must try if you're looking for a gentle and effective moisturizer for your kiddo."

The skin just feels and looks better after application. I was a bit worried when I read that it is scented. But, the scent is so pleasant (fruity) and so mild that I enjoyed having it there. I like the colour and texture of the cream. It's very creamy. It's not too thick or thin. I love that the cream is packed with ingredients and vitamins for health. I felt good using this on my children and I would gladly use it again. The only reason I gave this 4 stars is because I am not a fan of creams that you have to pump out.

Not only has it left my skin feeling incredibly soft and smooth, but it has also enhanced the application of my makeup. Unlike some moisturizers that can leave a cakey residue or cause makeup to slide off throughout the day, this one provides the perfect canvas for makeup application, ensuring a flawless finish that lasts.  What truly impressed me was its effectiveness on my son's dry spots. He often gets little patches of dryness on his cheeks and chin, especially during colder months. Within just a few days of using this product on him, I noticed a remarkable improvement. The dry spots were significantly less pronounced, and the redness and scratchiness were visibly reduced. It's comforting to know that this product is gentle enough for his delicate skin yet powerful enough to tackle stubborn dryness.  Aside from its impressive performance, I also appreciate the pleasant scent and easy application of this product.
