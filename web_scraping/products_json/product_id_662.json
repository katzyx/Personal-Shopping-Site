I use two drops in the am and 3 in the pm. I do find that this product does mold after some time (the bigger bottle bc a little goes a long way) but that just shows that they use less preservatives which is a plus. Get the smaller size to prevent this issue for yourselves. If you struggle with acne, get this!! Trust the process!"

I will say that this is not an instant results type of product. Consistent use is key for this oil to work.  Everyone's skin and personal preferences are very unique, so you may need to test out the best way to use for yourself because the recommended directions for use didn't work the best for me.  I apply at night mixed in with my moisturizer. I only use during the day if I'm not wearing makeup over it because it doesn't dry down well enough for me. Over time, I've noticed that my skin is less congested, doesn't produce as much sebum, and my pores look smaller/clearer. This oil does a good job with calming angry breakouts as well.  I have had my product for about 4 months now and have not experienced the mold/contamination that others have had an issue with. Hopefully this doesn't happen to too many other people because a little goes a long way with this oil and I will definitely get good use for a long time.  For reference: I am in my mid-thirties, oily skin type, and breakout-prone postpartum hormonal acne."

I threw a bottle away the first time figuring maybe i contaminated it somehow. Next bottle I was SO careful, kept in a dark cool area out of my bathroom, never touched the dropper to anything besides the bottle....and after a few weeks...yellow mold on the bottom. I continued to use after the yellow mold, because hey...maybe it IS sediment... and I had the worst-- most painful break out of my life completely outside of my typical hormonal break out window (1-2 weeks prior to my period is the only time i break out...this awful break out occurred after my period). I really tried with this oil, but until they resolve this issue, I will no longer give this company my money and opt for tansy oil elsewhere.

I woke up with skin around my mouth and eyes itchy, burning, raw and sooo red.  As the day went on it got more and more red and spread across my face.

I tried going without for a few months because that price point can be a bit much at times, and let me say my skin FELL APART! Uneven tone, breakouts, etc, it was not pretty. My combination,  extremely sensitive skin works so well with this product after moisturizer, I love the glow and how soft my skin is. Three drops morning and night is all I need.  Now, the mold issue. It's not mold, it's sediment. Since this is a preservative-free product, the ingredients settle differently than most. Have you ever had something mold that didn't reek? Does this reek? No. I've used this product for years, had the same concern and did my research. I store this is my medicine cabinet and it's fine.  No mold.  Calm down.  This product is AMAZING!"

A little goes a very long way for me using this product as necessary, so a .3oz bottle easily lasts about a year plus change. Working this over my skin with a gua sha tool helps the product to penetrate deeper, plus it helps flush out toxins under the skin and prevent product from getting wasted on my hands - all around, a win-win! That's been my go-to zit treatment for at least 3 years now, if not longer. There seems to have been a lot of concern over mold. I think all three bottles I've had have had a bit of the blue-green sediment that people are concerned about, but it has never affected the smell, consistency, or efficacy of the product for me, and I've seen Herbivore issue a statement that this is a non-harmful, non-toxic natural sediment, which I believe. I've waited to see if the amount of sediment would increase (mold generally grows pretty quickly) and it never has. I've always felt safe and comfortable using it."

I no longer have a single breakout even though I have very dry skin and live in high desert climate. I use this almost every single night, and coat my face with one whole dropper! I've seen a lot of comments about how there is mold growing at the bottom. I had some yellow stuff at the bottom of the bottle as well and ended up contacting customer service. I was assured that it is just the product separating. For reference, I store at a cool dry spot. I decided to trust the CS and kept using it. It's been three months and I have no unusual irritation. On the contrary, my skin hasn't been this clear at least for the past 6 years.  Here is my nightly skincare routine: 1) Single cleanse with a cleansing oil wash that emulsifies very well 2) Milky hydrating toner WITHOUT hyaluronic acid 3) Retinol (replace with <5% lactic acid twice per week) 4) Ceramide serum 5) Thiccc moisturizer with omega fatty acids 6) A whole dropper of this oil 7) Healing ointment if necessary 8) Lip mask  I've been keeping up this routine with different oils for about 8 months but have really been seeing a lot of results since I switched to this guy.   Anyway, here to tell you to try this if you have very dry and irritated skin and you've seen zero results from salicylic acid for your acne and bumps despite what youtubers have been repeatedly telling you."

I use it in addition to my naturopathica moisturizer as the last step, I have dry skin so I use both. I struggle with hormonal acne and uneven skin tone. This has completely aided in balancing the moisture levels in my skin (I actually have very dry skin) without making it too oily. It does not break me out at all, if anything I have found it helps in soothing breakouts. The biggest positive I would say is its effect on my skin tone, I have seen a drastic difference in my usual redness since using this. I also think it is helping to fade old acne marks."

I have drier sensitive combination skin, but lately Iu2019ve noticed it was getting oiler. My acne ended up getting much worse (I was getting blackheads and cystic acne on my forehead which I hadnu2019t previously) which I was attributing to my skin getting used to the new products since I started a whole new skin routine (all herbivore products). Eventually my skin got so bad after a month and a half I decided to stop one product at a time to see if it improved. I started with this one and almost immediately it got better. Thinking maybe it was a fluke once my skin cleared I gave it another shot and immediately the next day blackheads popped up in multiple places again. Sadly, this is the second oil Iu2019ve tried from herbivore (tried Phoenix previously with the same issue) and I think oils just donu2019t work with me. I do love all the other products Iu2019ve used from herbivore.  Side note I do use a mini fridge for all my skincare items so I did not notice the mold forming during the two months I had this."

I actually have dry skin, especially in the winter, but suffer with milia and dark spots that made me interested in this oil. The first thing I noticed was the smell - the only way I can describe it is that it smells rich. It smells like luxury. Like, Oh, she's got MONEY money, rich. Putting this oil on, I felt like I was a millionaire influencer doing my nighttime skincare routine for Harper's Bazaar. It's faaaancy, y'all. I love the feel and finish of this oil, too. It's less thick/viscous than I expected it to be, but it doesn't skimp on hydration, so you feel deeply moisturized and plump upon applying it. It sinks into the skin quickly, but does leave that faint layer of surface moisture, so it's probably best for a pre-bed routine rather than before makeup. That's my preference, so it's perfect for me, but YMMV! I noticed an almost immediate reduction in the look of my pores and my surface redness. This feels like a true self care moment in the sense that it is luxurious and feels a little indulgent, but it also does what it promises. Can't wait to upgrade to the bigger size!"

I canu2019t say it really helped my redness but it definitely hydrated my skin and made my skin tone look a bit more even. I was using this as the last step in my skincare routine at night after moisturizer and I would wake up with hydrated skin that looked brighter. However, a few weeks after using this I found the Kiehlu2019s Cannabis Sativa Oil and it says itu2019s used for redness, and I started using that to see which one works better. The Kiehlu2019s works arguably better for redness than this one. I was amazed at that oil and how it helped my rosacea. So, if youu2019re looking for an oil to help redness I would go for Kiehlu2019s. If youu2019re looking for something to help brighten and hydrate skin, you could go with either, the Lapis oil does have a lot of great anti-aging ingredients as well, and I probably will go back to it since I have it, but Iu2019m just not sure I would buy this again, especially if hen the Kiehlu2019s is $20 less and targets my skin concerns.

A year later I have no acne AT ALL and I have tested to see if this is really what helped and in combination with the pink cloud face wash from herbivore, it is 100% what is keeping my acne at bay. I went 2 weeks without it and my acne came right back, and as soon as I used it again, the acne was gone. Just give it a chance, and return it if it doesnu2019t work, but it is a game changer, and everyone in my life has noticed the difference in my skins texture! Use it with the blue tansy mask if you really want to see a difference!"

A few months of trying different products and a trip to the dermatologist with a prescription and topical cream that did not really help much, I was getting extremely discouraged that the results were not what I wanted. Then, on one of my many trips to Sephora, I came across this product. Skeptical about the price, but already sold on the brand (I have the Herbivore bakuchiol--also amazing), I read reviews online while standing in the store. I saw a mix of bad and amazing, so I decided to just buy it and try it out. Well--let me tell you, I am so glad that I did. After only 1 month and a half, I am absolutely stunned at how amazing my skin is now, and I do believe it has a lot to do with this product. It has transformed my skin into almost flawless, and as we approach summer, I now am no longer stressing over the fact that I will have a naked face on the beach---I no longer need to cover up blemishes!

I was hopeless that nothing could help- I was wrong!! After much research into face oils, washes, cremes, exfoliant peels, etc.. I decided to purchase this product as it claimed to be made for oily acne prone skin. Integrating it into my daily routine after a 10% benzoyl peroxide face wash and regular face masks has TREMENDOUSLY helped my acne and the harsh redness of the scars. I cant say for certain that this product is preventing new acne formation but I know for certain that it helps breakouts clear faster and leave less of an impact (although, I have had much less breakouts since using it regularly..)  Not only does the product smell amazing, it also feels amazing on my skin. A little goes such a long way. I've had the 50mL bottle for three months now and I am only 1/2 through it. It absorbs quickly and leaves a pleasant, non greasy dew. I am very frugal with my money however, this product was worth every penny and I will purchase it again. Easily the best product I have ever purchased for my skin care."

It smells nice and absorbs nicely. However, like other Herbivore products, the shelf life on this is precarious and it's easy for bacteria and/or mold to grow in the bottle.   I started to use a new product in addition to my Lapis oil that was supposed to cause some initial purging. I had a few bumps, but they went away quickly, and my skin was looking great, until one day I had cystic acne coming in, along with a bunch of small white bumps, and my skin looked ruddy. I quickly stopped using my new treatment, but nothing was improving. I was ready to go see a dermatologist, when I noticed there was a viscus yellow mold in the bottom of my Lapis bottle.   After some investigation, I found that in addition to the Cloud Lotion, most Herbivore oils have the minimum amount of preservative, which means while they are usually okay, if you were to forget to screw the cap tightly one night or if the dropper came in contact with bacteria, there is a chance it could fester and grow. So, basically I was rubbing mold and bacteria into my skin twice a day...  Within a few days of stopping the Lapis (and doing a lot of exfoliating and using retinol cream) my skin was looking much better and a few weeks out with some new products, my skin is back in a good place.   I do love Herbivore oils - they do really absorb nicely and smell great, but I can't really say they are worth the experience I went through. There are other clean brands that are a bit more shelf stable that work just as nicely."

Also the smell, which i know some people like, turns me off (personal preference). Mine also had some kind of brown ..microfilm stuff on the bottom, that i didn't notice when i first purchased it. Not sure if that is relevant but it certain made me think twice about reusing after that.

As for acne you will notice after the first night that your skin looks less inflamed. This isnu2019t going to be drying out your acne like some other kind Acne products would do. Instead it helps to calm your skin down a whole lot. The biggest problem that I have with anti-acne products is normally they make your skin look very dry and aged, they also tend to just work on the surface level. The entire her before line tends to work beneath the skin. My acne didnu2019t disappear overnight but my face felt 100 times more comfortable. And now that Iu2019ve been using the herbivore line for my skin care routine, which includes The pink cleanser, prism, lapis and bakuchiol, I no longer have any type of acne and my skin looks softer and more radiant.

I have oily/acne prone skin, but it can definitely get dehydrated if I don't moisturize properly and then I'm oily with weird dry patches. I can't believe what a difference this has made to my skin. After cleansing and using TO Buffet, I use 3 drops of this (1 for each cheek, 1 for my forehead). Massage it in to my skin and let it sink in for a minute. It absorbs quickly, doesn't feel sticky or heavy. Ill put a light Cerave SPF moisturizer over top, little bit of powder and I'm good to go. I don't get overly oily during the day, if I wear makeup/use a primer, everything sit well overtop. My acne marks have faded. And the amount of acne I get has been significantly reduced.   I bought a second set with the small bottle because of how well this oil worked with my skin, and the price was too good to pass up. I didn't want to shell out $$$ for the full sized bottle yet, and thought I might be able to find a dupe. I looked around/researched, and the only thing I found that *might* compare was Pacifica Super Flower face oil. I tried it. I just wasn't the same. It feels a *bit* heavier and doesn't sit as well under makeup. I seem to get a little oilier during the day too. I'll use it up mixed with the Blume Meltdown oil (another oil that I love), but it's what made me realize the Lapis oil is the real deal for my skin. Holiday 2020 sale came around and that's when I decided to go for it. Very much looking forward to having this as a staple in my skincare regime. Since I use so little at a time, i know this bottle will last awhile."

Decided to give this a try, I have used facial oil before and so its nothing new, still I bought it as a last resort and boy was I glad that I bought it. I used it day and night, and by the third/fourth day, my acnes started to calm, the redness have gone down significantly, new ones were still popping up but less fierce.  I then began to use Erno Lazlo's seamud soap and this combination is the bomb.  All previous breakouts have subsided, and I have none.....none acne now whatsoever.  So if you have exhausted all your options give this a try. Try Erno Lazlo's soap too. In the beginning I used about 3 drops day, 5 drops night.  Now as a maintenance I only use it once a day. It is an oil afterall so you really have to spend time massaging it in.  The scent is strong as first but I grew to love it, its just a natural, medicinal smell.  Way better than those overly artificial floral notes."

One recommended product was a basic facial cleanser (that I really liked), the second was this, and the third was a nutrient-filled moisturizer (a little heavy for my skin). For reference, my skin type is combination, moderate-severely acne prone, and I have a big issue with pores and dead skin cell build-up.   As for the impact of this product: I used about half a bottle before giving it away to my mom, who has adult acne but much drier skin. I often found myself hesitating to use my moisturizer afterwards, because I just found this to be so greasy and rather uncomfortable, even with just two to three drops. As someone with a clogged-pore problem, I think this actually made my pores worse and left my skin looking rather dull. When it came to my ACNE acne (pustles and cysts), I really saw no difference, which was so disappointing considering I had spent so much on my first non-drugstore facial routine and this was supposed to be my u201ctreatmentu201d step. I used about 3/4 the bottle before I gave up.  Flash forward a year later: I have found my holy grail of products, including retinol from The Inkey List, The Ordinaryu2019s lactic acid pore treatment AND their niacinamide and zinc treatment, the Aztec Secret deep pore cleansing mask (once weekly), the Youth to the People super greens cleanser, and the Youth to the People adaptogen moisturizer.   Letting anyone who has a similar skin type to mine know, if youu2019re searching for clear, managable skin, the products you need ARE out there, and often less expensive than you might think. However, this oil is not one of them."

My skin is also red in some areas but this oil has helped my skin balance its tones so well!!

            "review_text": "This is one of the most frustrating products ever. When I first got it, it was the absolute BEST oil Iu2019ve ever used. It cleared my acne prone skin up almost immediately, and left me with glowing, perfect skin. When I was less than halfway through the bottle, I noticed a whitish-green viscous mass at the bottom of the bottle. It did not look like typical separation or anything, it definitely looked contaminated. I returned it and even an employee commented on how weird it looked. I got another one (from a different store in a different state) to give it another chance, and made sure when using it to keep it in a cold dark place (a skincare fridge outside of the bathroom), never touched the dropper to my hands or anything else, and washed my hands before use. I work in a sterile lab environment so I handled it like I would in lab to prevent contamination. Less than a month later, I saw more mold/bacteria accumulating in the bottom. This time I returned and didnu2019t repurchase. I canu2019t justify the price tag when the product gets contaminated so quickly and forces me to return it. I also will not put anything on my face containing an unknown contaminant like that.  I love natural products and herbivore products because they really do wonders for my skin, but the lack of any sort of preservative ruins this oil before I can use it all. Itu2019s so disappointing because the product is great but doesnu2019t last, even in the optimal environment I tried to provide for it. :(  If you do try it out, Iu2019d keep an eye on it to make sure that nothing starts growing in it."

            "review_text": "Sephora, please publish my review of this oil! I bought it to help with overall texture and appearance of my skin, at that point my skin was clear and without any breakouts, just a bit of texture and post-acne marks. First time I applied it at night and it felt very nice and absorbed into my skin very fast, I woke up in the morning glowing and my pores and acne marks seemed a bit better just after one use. So you can imagine how excited I got after seeing such quick results, I applied it again the following night expecting to wake up glowing again. I woke up with a lot of clogged pores/comedones  on my chicks and with 3 huge deep under the skin blemishes that were super painful and red. I freaked out and stopped using the oil immediately, babied my skin for a week using peels and AHA serum, then decided to give it another try just to make sure it was the oil that caused such damage. Used it at night, woke up with 3 new pimples on my chin and cheeks and I never get pimples on my chin. So long story short it does cause acne if you have oily skin because there is coconut oil listed as one of the ingredients, it`s extremely comedogenic and can`t be tolerated by oily/combo skin. Now it will take me at least 3 weeks to get rid of pimples and another 2 months for the marks to fade. With all that said, it does work great for my sister who has dry not acne prone skin, so just be careful and patch test before committing to buy it."

Their natural, penetrate deeper and thereu2019s no risk of them piling and flaking off of your face! I bought the clarifying mask and lapis oil duo to try and loved them both. The clarifying mask has excellent ingredients and directions. It got rid of ache, blackheads and scars and Iu2019d I wore it for the recommended time for sensitive skin it didnu2019t dry my face out and the lapis oil balanced everything out on my face. The lapis oil smells incredible. It has an earthy scent but not overpowering it all. Itu2019s hard to explain what it smells like, maybe subtly like blue tansy? It smells like a sapphire.. which makes 0 sense lol. The liquid is beautiful in the bottle. The results though. Ugh. I definitely over do it with the clarifying, purifying, exfoliating masks and serums. This oil has boosted my moisture levels WITHOUT causing acne or blackheads, which is a first! There is no greasy feeling and my skin feels hydrated all day!!! But the mini doesnu2019t last very long and I want more. I want to find a cheaper dupe for it but I doubt Iu2019ll be able to. I love this way better than the cbd emerald oil. I love the emerald oil but it doesnu2019t have a strong hemp scent but boy does it hydrate my skin extremely well! Ughhh, I hate these price tags. I think I may invest in some of Herbivores items.. Especially this oil."

I tried several different high-end products, humidifiers, everything imaginable, but nothing made much of an impact. Iu2019ve been using this product for a few weeks now and noticed an improvement from day 1. The breakouts have stopped, the one pimple that came up after I started using it cleared much faster than with any spot treatments Iu2019ve ever tried, my skin is softer and more vibrant, and the marks from my recent breakouts are fading quickly. I canu2019t recommend it enough!"

I have SUPER fair skin and always look very rosy and this has basically completely cancelled out my redness in general and especially the redness around my breakouts.  The smell is not overwhelming and the formula doesn't feel too oily - give it a few minutes to soak in before applying other products on top of it. I apply it directly after cleansing and toning my face so that it has an opportunity to really treat my skin concerns and then will layer my other products on top of it. This product is definitely up there with regards to pricing when it comes to acne products so if you're nervous definitely try out the sample size before making the investment. Acne treatment tends to be expensive anyways so I figured I didn't have much to lose by trying this out - it ended up working like a dream. Will definitely be repurchasing, and now I have the little travel sized container left over to fill up for trips."

I admittedly like to pick at my blackheads with my comedone extraction tool and I do go a little overboard resulting in red, irritated, inflamed and hyper-pigmented skin. I applied this oil after extraction and cleansing and instantly, the redness and inflammation was reduced. It usually takes a while to notice if a skincare product was working but INSTANTLY? Ok so I thought its maybe just a temporary effect so I continued to use this for a week and I was stunned. Scars that usually took 2-3 weeks to heal were visibly healed after a week of use, with no other change in my skincare regimen. If you dont care about that, its still a fantastic everyday face oil because its super lightweight, easily absorbed and has a calming scent. Needless to say, I bought the full size and dont think Iu2019ll be switching!"

At first I broke out in tiny little bumps over my cheeks, but I think that was either my skin freaking out at a new skin product or purging because, let me tell you, since then this stuff has worked WONDERS on my skin. My redness is almost unnoticeable, my acne is almost completely gone (with the exception of a PMS zit or two, and those clear up twice as fast as they normally would), and all of my acne scars have faded to the point that they're barely visible! My pores have also shrunk, and my skin just??? GLOWS?? I've been getting compliments left right and center from people telling me how good and bright my skin is looking - something that has NEVER happened to me before. I am honestly in shock, this stuff is a new holy grail for me.  AND, I've been using this twice a day for two months and the bottle looks barely touched. Seriously, the oil is still above the diamond logo sticker. This stuff is so expensive but so, so worth it in my opinion - it's going to easily last me a year, probably more.

I went through two mini lapis oils and decided it was finally time I had to splurge on the full size.   I spent the money on the full size and within a couple weeks, my acne was suddenly worse than it ever had been. It hurt to sleep on and it hurt to smile. I stopped the Herbivore routine altogether and have been keeping to cetaphil/basic products a bit and a lot of the inflammation has gone down, but now I have a lot more scars I have to deal with.   Basically, I donu2019t know if I would recommend this product. I think it takes a very specific skin type, but for my pretty severe acne, it just made my skin very angry.

For my normal to dry skin, it sinks in quickly, leaving my skin supple but not greasy. On days when my skin is not dry, I use this and perhaps squalane oil and I don't need heavy creams unless in doing a night mask. It's my second to last step in my night time regime. But sometimes, I'll use it through out the day of I'm not wearing makeup, just a teeny drop.   I love the consistency and the smell is addictive, I swear it is like aroma therapy.

After only TWO days of using this stuff both day and night, I can already SEE and FEEL the difference it's making for my skin.

Does not cause breakouts at all. My skin is so much more even and healthy-looking when I use this oil regularly. Iu2019ve actually been going foundation-free and have been getting compliments on my skin. I use it at night in combination with B-Hydra by Drunk Elephant. I feel like the two products work well together and the B-Hydra is lightweight and helps the oil to sink in. The Lapis oil is a bit oily at first but soaks in well after a few minutes. Sometimes I use it in the mornings before putting on a little Hourglass powder, a little blush, some mascara and Iu2019m out the door! I just wish they sold this oil in different sizes. Iu2019d prefer a smaller bottle. I originally got a small bottle in an Herbivore Kit along with the face mask. Lasted a long time. This was my first time buying the full-sized bottle. The price is high, but you get a LOT of oil. A little goes a long way so although this will last forever, I feel like the shelf life may not be as long because this is full of natural ingredients. I guess I will find out."

I still use benzol peroxide on the larger pimples but this oil seems to be preventing my acne for the most part!

I've read a lot of the reviews and I know some people are freaked out because normal coconut oil is a nightmare for acne - but this is not that. Fractionated coconut oil goes through a process that removes the fatty acids that block pores. It actually rates a big fat ZERO on the comedogenic scale. That being said I still wouldn't use this as an all-over oil as it even causes my combination skin to be a bit oily. But as a spot treatment for already formed or emerging pimples this is my go-to treatment, even over all the other spot treatments I've ever used. I use the rollerball size and apply to clean skin before bed. By the next morning the inflammation is almost completely gone and the pimple generally completely disappears by the second day and another overnight application. I've even used it on hives and razor bumps. It may be too heavy to apply all over for oilier skin types. For me this is a must-have blemish treatment."

I have rather reactive skin, which is similar to sensitive skin, so I was always afraid to try new products and lifestyle changes. I tried infrared light therapy, face masks, cleansers that didnu2019t involve water, high strength spot treatments,  eating healthier, taking supplements for skin, drinking more water, everything. But then on Christmas that year, I was gifted a little set that contained this oil, and I instantly went through the ingredients before replacing my usual moisturizer with it, without much thought. Within weeks, I noticed that my skin had begun to clear up significantly, and I curious as to what changed my skin, when I noticed the tiny little bottle of Lapis on my desk. After that, I knew I had to buy the full size, despite being on a college budget. That leads me to today, with my second bottle of Lapis, about 40% full after nine months of daily use, and much clearer skin. This is definitely worth the price, and I would recommend this to anyone out there suffering from acne, especially environmental and stress related acne, as well as combination skin, as thus does a great job at hydrating dry patches while not turning my t-zone into a greasy mess."

Everytime I use this with my serum (Herbivore Prism or Tatcha Hydration) it always makes the serums ball up into little balls on my face and its disgusting.  It is not at all dead skin, its just the reacting with the serums and stripping them off my skin.  It does not work well with other products.  It doesn't do a good job of nurturing my skin either as an oil like it should. Its more of a dry oil instead of a moisturizing one.  If you only need a facial oil and no serums, this will probably work very well for your skin and help not cause any more acne.  It does sink into the skin after about five minutes and it reduces redness very well.  The scent is not overpowering and will go away really quick.  It also does not leave a film on your face either.  The packaging is definetly amazing, its made of glass and the dropper is pretty decent.  A little goes a long way, but again I do not suggest this oil if you are using serums as well.  If you are a minimalist using only a cleanser and a moisturizer then I suggest trying this product to treat acne or redness or if you have a lot of oil and need a better drying oil."

I've using it day and night for a week now, and the clogged pores on my cheeks are clearing up (no more tiny bumps!). My make up also stays on much better during the day. I love it!"

Let me just say this now: As someone with OILY, ACNE-PRONE, and HYPER-PIGMENTED SKIN, I loooovee this product! It works really well for me. Itu2019s lightweight, skinks into the skin fast, and does not feel heavy compared to other oils like argan oil, and coconut oil (which I heard is actually bad for your skin).   I use it every night after cleanser, toner, and essence and follow it up by using moisturizer. I think a little goes a long way; three to five drops as instructed. I pat it into my skin, rather than rubbing it.  There is a SCENT thatu2019s kind of herb-y and medicinal, but I donu2019t find it unpleasant or overwhelming.  It leaves my skin looking GLOWY and makes my skin look and feel amazing when I wake up the next day!  Now: the downsides... First of all, the price. I really donu2019t know if itu2019s worth that much to be perfectly honest. I wouldnu2019t say u201cgo buy it because you absolutely need it.u201d Sure, it works for me, BUT I wouldnu2019t recommend it if itu2019s out of your budget.  I bought the full size version after finishing up the mini size (which lasted me like... four months). When I ordered the full version, I expected it to be much bigger than what I actually got (especially because I paid way more for it than the mini size   the mini mask).  Iu2019ve attached a picture of the mini size, the full size, and a full sized UD All-Nighter spray for a size comparison.  TAKEAWAYS Pros * Great for Oily Skin, Acne-Prone, Hyper-Pigmented Skin * Light-Weight * Quickly skinks into skin * Scent, but not overwhelming or unpleasant  Cons * Have to weigh out the costs and benefits - do you think that itu2019s worth the money? (Iu2019m not going to decide for you) * Much smaller than what I anticipated (may be my fault but I thought Iu2019d bring it up)"

It balances your facial oils and helps reduce your production. It doesn't make me break out, and is sensitive enough that it doesn't upset any breakouts I have. I use this morning and night and it moisturizes any dry patches, and keeps oil at bay. It smells nice, packaging is adorable, and I only use 3 drops for my whole face. It is a bit expensive, but I bought mine in April (now September) and have used it twice a day every day, and still have more than half a bottle left! Pair it with the Blue Tansy Face Mask."

My skin hasn't felt so amazing in so long (ever?). It completely calms redness and breakouts and controls grease leaving my skin feeling moisturized and soft. I never knew this was possible! Trust me, if you're wavering on whether or not to get it, do it! I am buying full size after my sample runs out."

I had been using the Sunday Riley UFO oil  for a few years, and I just felt like my skin was beginning to get used to it. I did some research and found lots of reviews stating that this product really help with texture - Iu2019m thrilled that they were true!   This product has helped flatten any texture on my skin. So many masks for acne/texture really dry the skin out, but I find my skin looks radiant and glowing after using this over night. It definitely didnu2019t work overnight, but Iu2019ve been using it for 3 weeks and Iu2019ve noticed a huge difference from where Iu2019ve started to now. It absorbs in to the skin fast and doesnu2019t leave a gross residue in the morning. I just wake up with healthy and refreshed skin.  If youu2019re on the fence, just try it! Not only does it work, it looks very chic and smells herbal - kind of spa-like :)  I originally bought the mini set of this and the mask to try out, but I have now repurchased both in the full size!"

Then a friend gave me this Lapis Oil, because it didn't work for her (it broke her out). I wasn't expecting much but I stripped my entire skincare routine down to a gentle cleanser, 1x weekly Fresh Lotus Youth Preserve masks, snail-based night cream and this oil. My skin has never, ever looked this good. No acids and yet my pores are clean and clear, texture even, redness toned down. I had no idea that treating my skin so gently and *adding* oil would do this. The price tag is no biggie because I no longer have to buy all the other stuff I used to think I needed."

Incredible for skin balance- A holy grail product in my book."

As you can imagine, skincare product shopping is very difficult and a lot of trial and error to see what won't irritate my redness or make it worse. I fell in love within the first few days as I noticed my face looking a bit brighter and I would wake up with this really nice glow. The smell doesn't bother me, but I do recommend only using a few drops to avoid the oily face look.  My skin has reacted very positively to this oil surprisingly and it's now a staple in my routine. Doesn't break me out, doesn't make my redness worse and seems to calm my skin down. Not to mention, gives me a great glow. I only have subtype 1 Rosacea which is a lot of flushing, so I'm not sure how it may work for someone else. But I am in love!"

Only one use, I woke up with such soft texture, brightened, glowing skin. Even better than my skin was before. (When I used to be proud of my skin) and it keeps it that way for a whole day. Controls oil. I met up with a friend today(after 3times of use) she was surprised how good even and soft my skin looks. I didnu2019t even wear makeup!!! She immediately ordered a bottle.

It also gave me lone pimples on my under eyes which I never ever get. So I had to return it even though part of me loved it and part of me didnu2019t. If you have texture and uneven dull skin that can handle oils well, I highly recommend. But for girls like me with unpredictable problematic skin, I say give it a try but donu2019t be too disappointed if it doesnu2019t work out. It also takes a minute to sink into the skin as well, just a heads up. But it doesnu2019t leave you oily so thatu2019s a great thing."

I tried layering my moisturizer and primer under and over this oil, and no combination ever worked. My face was slippery and I would wake up with more active pimples, not fewer! Coconut oil, which is highly comedogenic, is in the ingredients, and yet this product is marketed toward acne-prone skin types.

I recently moved to California and since I moved I have been struggling with my completion, dryness, sensitive skin, redness and more break outs than Iu2019ve ever had in my entire life!! I was hesitant to try this product because about one month ago a Sephora employee referred me to the biossance rose oil and after one month of use I only noticed a difference with my complexion. My skin tone was more balanced but I still had the frequent break outs and white heads which lead to more redness. It wasnu2019t really solving everything I wanted to solve.   About one week ago another employee referred me to this product and I seriously couldnu2019t be happier with the results. My skin looks and feels healthy. For the first time in 8 months since I moved to California!! My white heads are almost completely gone. The oils absorbs into my skin  exactly like you would want it too. (unlike the biossance which doesnu2019t seem to fully absorb but definitely does help skin tone).   My skin ton has balanced and evened out to the point where I donu2019t feel the need to wear foundation any more. (Which is also a first since I moved)   The most impressive thing about this product was I noticed results with in one week of use. Iu2019m going on 10 days strong of consistent use every day and have noticed legitimate results. The exact results I was looking for. I have been using this product either in the morning or at night. But definitely at least daily and some times twice a day. In the am and pm. I also love that once this product is absorbed into my skin I can apply my normal daily make up and my face still feels clean and I havenu2019t had any further break outs or white heads. It blends well with my daily make up.   I hope this product brings you as much happiness and success as itu2019s brought me! Will definitely be buying this product long term and I couldnu2019t recommend it more."

            "review_text": "This oil has been a game changer for my skincare routine. I honestly didn't expect much out of it other than hydration, but let me tell you why I'm in love with this product!  - It doesn't leave the skin feeling greasy or wet like other face oils can. This acts more like a dry oil, sets into the skin within 10 minutes, but still punches in hydration.  - It sinks in overnight. I use Lapis at night and Phoenix in the morning (maybe it's the colors that incline me to do this?) and every morning when I wake up, Lapis is beautifully absorbed into my skin. I have combo skin, so whenever there's too much oil it just kinda sits on top. Nobody would even know I go to bed with 5 drops of oil on my face!  - It really does treat break outs and calm the skin. I have a little bit of natural pink tones in my cheeks, and I tend to have hormonal break outs on my chin. Every morning I wake up with toned, bright skin and break outs are at a minimum. It has helped me even out the small bumps I get from beard burn. My boyfriend's facial hair is quite rough and can irritate my skin if he goes awhile without upkeep.  - I didn't love the smell at first, but now I find it soothing and relaxing. It helps me wind down for my night time routine.  I've been using this religiously on my skin for the past 3 months and honestly love it every night. I look forward to doing my nightly ritual because of this oil. If you want it to go one step further in your routine, use it on top of your moisturizer as your very last step. Since oil is thicker than water, your skin (just like a glass of water) will pull the oil in deeper from the density. Anything you use under the oil will be pulled deeper into the skin and you'll get a little more bang from your products."

            "review_text": "Upon first using this oil, my skin broke out in cystic-like acne for a week or 2. An esthetician once told me that reactive skin can always break out to *any* change in your skin care routine... so I stuck with it and I'm so glad I did. I am almost 40 and have skin like a teenager; my skin is very combination (like very oily, VERY dry), red, sensitive and I have scars from acne as a teenager. I did notice almost instantly that my skin felt smoother... less flakey, foundation went on like a dream... but I didn't start seeing the real benefits for about 4-6 weeks. My skin is more balanced, moisturized, less red and the scars may even very faintly be fading. I have spent an ungodly amount of money over the years trying any products that might help me just to give them away or throw them in the trash... I will definitely continue to repurchase this product when it runs out. Now some cons, just to be fair. The product is thick and it sits on my face/doesn't absorb quickly. I am now only using this at night and am using a different dryer oil/serum mix in the mornings before foundation. This product also smells bad... like fish oil. If you've ever taken the Omega 3-6-9 oil capsules... well, you can smell a resemblance, but it fades quickly. Lastly, despite what some other reviewers said... I will go through this quickly. My dry skin soaks this stuff up and I have to use 7-10 drops each night. In 6 weeks I've put a noticeable dent in the bottle. When I read other reviews, I thought this bottle could last me 6 months to a year, now I will be happy with 4 months before rebuying.  I have seen other reviewers mention breaking out after using this... my advice is if this happens to you, stick with it! My acne has NOTICEABLY improved... but it took a few weeks (with some bumps in the road on the way - pun intended). I would recommend anyone who has suffered with difficult skin to try this product out!"

I've tried everything, switching birth control, going off birth control, creams from the dermatologist, expensive skin care from multiple lines. I went into sephora looking for foundation last week and left with 20 things like we all do haha but this is one of the random products they talked me into.. the price had me skeptical but I figured it was worth a shot and I could always return it if it didn't help.. I am a week in using this product and where my skin is nowhere near perfect yet I can honestly say in just one week I've seen the biggest difference I've seen from any product!! Skin in slowly clearing from what I can tell! Only complaint I could say which it's not really a complaint because I'm just so happy it works is I have naturally oily skin so at night I do the 10 drops as they say but during the day I do about 5-6 as my skin doesn't entirely suck it up. I will definitely be gettting more from this brand!!"

Whenever my skin is feeling a bit irritated or Iu2019m trying to get rid of those pesky chin breakouts, this is the oil I grab. I use mine as the last step in my night skincare routine- double cleanse, toner, essence, serum, night cream and then this to seal everything in. Even found an unadvertised benefit; figured if this soothes irritation and break-outs on my face, it would probably be good on my just-waxed bikini area that was freaking out and, let me tell you, this is absolutely incredible for post-wax redness, bumps, you name it! The hair that grew back was also the softest itu2019s ever been, lol! All-in-all, definitely go for this oil- it really does what is says it will and more!"

The product itself is a hydrating oil that definitely helps my oily/combo acne prone skin. It has more of an impact on blemishes than it does on dry skin, though. A little goes a LONG way, I only use 4 drops to cover my whole face in the morning/night so this product lasts a long time. I've been using it for a couple weeks now and it has been keeping blemishes in check. The natural/vegan ingredients are why I gravitated to this brand in the first place and I love that I'm not putting harsh chemicals on my skin anymore."

So I tried to go through the ingredients on the website and saw a lot of reg flags here. Fractionated Coconut oil should NOT be for oily skin as it clogs the pores so baaad!!! Blue tansy, well that's pretty tricky essential oil to tell the truth. Many people can get allergy from flower hydrophobic liquid such as blue tansy. Also the blue color derived from the distillation process will not stay long, it's not natural composition from the plant itself, over time it will fade into olive green then brown, this where the azulene already dies. Then Kukui Nut does have higher Linoleic Acid than Oleic Acid but the ratio of these lipids is not the effective number to help oily skin acne problems. It's gonna be good for normal skin, not oily skin. I love the packaging it feels heavy and expensive and also the campaign looks simple yet high end but I'm not that hipster who follow natural hype without looking into the details. Price tag also makes y'all think twice."

I have very dry skin, an oily forehead, and small red breakouts along my cheeks/nose/forehead. Iu2019ve tried everything to get rid of it.

I've struggled with acne since middle school and have tried just about everything, prescription creams and antibiotics included to varying degrees of success, but nothing gave me legitimately clear, radiant skin.  I had a bad experience with facial oils a couple years ago, but was finally ready to give a different version a chance.    I never expect miracles from skin care products, but after about a week of using this product (morning and night) I realized that my skin was softer, smoother and just looked healthier than I can ever remember.  I've been using it for almost a month now and my breakouts have been kept to a minimum, just a few small whiteheads that are gone in a day or so, but no large, angry and painful red bumps like usual.  I've even considered going make-up free a few days, something I haven't done since I was 14.  This isn't to say my skin is perfect, I still have a lot of discoloration from years of acne, but it does seem less noticeable.  The true test will be my next period, which is when my breakouts typically spike.    Regardless, I'd say this is definitely worth a try if you're looking for a solution for your skin.  It's my new favorite product and one of the most effective things I've ever tried.  And if you're worried about the price, know that a little goes a long way.  I've been using it twice a day for almost a month and you can barely tell the bottle's even been opened."

I was experiencing the worst breakouts Iu2019ve had in a couple years (cystic acne and pimples, all over my face neck and chest, just awful). The first night I used the Lapis oil my skin calmed down. The redness and inflammation almost totally disappeared. Now after regular use my skin has gone from sensitive and oily to almost normal (at least as close to normal as Iu2019ve ever been). Iu2019ve found this oil works really well alone and I donu2019t need another moisturizer. During the daytime I apply the Lapis oil over my serums (Niacinamide and Vitamin C) then I apply Arcona ReOzone 40 tinted sunscreen (Sephora pleeeeease start carrying this brand). At night I apply this after any serums or AHA/BHA treatments. I am so happy with the results that Iu2019ve purchased the small rollerball bottle for my 14 year-old son to try. He has skin like mine that is prone to eczema and Iu2019m hopeful this will replace some of the harsher acne products he uses.   If youu2019re on the fence about this product just give it a try. Iu2019m justifying the price because Iu2019m not using another moisturizer and I can skip foundation because my skin looks great now. If your allergic to ragweed or chamomile proceed cautiously because Blue Tansy is a type of chamomile and might cause a reaction."

I have sensitive, acne prone skin (STILL, at 30), I break out when I simply touch my face. I believe the Lapis oil, along with the Blue Tansy mask, are partially if not fully responsible for keeping my skin relatively clear for the past few months! I purged at first, breaking out a little more than usual, but now that I've been using it for a few months my skin has settled and right now is very clear and loves this stuff. These are some acne secrets right here: After washing my face, then using the Blue Tansy mask, I quickly run an ice cube all over my skin, dry it, then spray the Herbivore Green Tea toner and let it dry slightly. On damp skin, I massage the Lapis oil into my skin, doing a lymphatic massage all over my face for a minute. Then after that I put my serum, then either salicylic acid or retinol on last. It's worked for me so far!"

It does make me look a little bit oily because i usually don't apply makeup on top but i like the natural glowy look. As far as helping with breakouts i believe it has been helping prevent future breakouts and getting rid of acne scars. The price is definitely high but based on how much I've used this first month i think this will last me about 6 months which is a long time. overall i think that this oil is worth it if you have breakout prone skin I'm excited to see further improvement with continued use!!!!"

I noticed within 2 weeks that my skin looked really clear, my makeup looked better, and my redness was almost gone. No product has ever done this for me, I am amazed.  People say it smells odd and it definitely took me a while to get used to it. The best way I can describe the smell is if you combine grape and pine?

I almost never get acne on my cheeks or jawline except for the random ingrown beard hair once or twice a year. I didn't think it was this oil at first, I just took it as just a random breakout. then I switched back to one of my old favourite face oils. the oils was the only thing I switched out and my jawline cleared cleared up in a little over a week. so I have to conclude that it is this oil that caused it. Maybe it's because it's a thicker oil, I'm not sure. I would still recommend this product, because it is really good at calming the skin. Just maybe get a sample if that's possible, or get the mini set that they have out now. Just try it before you splurge on the full size."

I used to break out with 7-10 mini bumps on my forehead or cheeks during my cycle, but now I rarely get any zits! Maybe the occasional one or two. I've also gotten so many compliments on my skin this past year. I like to pair this oil up with a Vitamin C serum by Mad Hippie so that probably helps with the glow and smoothness as well. I've definitely recommended this oil to friends and one recently said that the oil helps with her recent acne scars as well!

It has not caused any irritation or breakouts on my sensitive, dry, acne prone skin. The only down side I will say is that this is not a very moisturizing oil. But I have extremely dry skin so it's not the oils fault. I just layer my moisturizer and another oil over this. So I think if you have normal or even oily skin you will love this facial oil.

I didn't like it at first because I didn't think it did any better than my old facial oil (Laura Mercier rose oil) but after consistent use I can honestly say this oil has improved my skin.  I layer 3-4 drops over essence, BHA, and hydrating serum--this is my last step before makeup primer-- it sinks in within minutes and makes a great base for makeup! It does not make my face feel greasy, and over time I've noticed that it's visibly helped regulate my skin's oil production.   The oil blend is appropriate for oily/breakout prone skin.. Some of them are known to prevent irritation and none of the ingredients have appeared to clog my pores. Over 2 years I've seen my skin get less oily while becoming more radiant. A single bottle has lasted me 2 years of daily use! It still has a bit left and I'll be buying another bottle once I use up some of my other (long neglected) oils.  I actually really like the light natural scent and the beautiful blue colour. Since the bottle is clear, remember to keep out of sunlight! I store mine in a bathroom cabinet to prevent the product from turning."

I got a sample a few days ago and my acne scars have diminished quite a bit, I have a radiant glow, and although I still get a few breakouts (ugh, hormonal acne) they go away a lot more quickly with this. The first night I tried it, I had a few small white heads on my cheeks. I woke up the next morning and it was if the oil had purged them and they seemed bigger. I was hesitant about using it again, but the second night I put the oil on and The next day, they were gone. I love the smell and feel of this oil. The only other one I have tried that is just as wonderful is the Korres Viramin C oil. This was truly made for those who suffer from breakouts. My advice is: Give it time to work. I am definitely buying the full size!"

Enter Herbivore line.  I got the blue tansy mask on a whim and was completely in love. I love the ingredients, the way it made my skin feel, the visible change I saw almost instantly. It felt too good to be true. So I bit the bullet and invested in Lapis.  It's a gorgeous oil. It absorbs well, smells heavenly, and has done some magic on my skin already. I don't feel so terrified being out without makeup anymore. The scars have visibly reduced. I can't wait to see what a year of using this blue tansy combo of mask and oil will do.

It is light, smells pleasant (I don't agree that this smells bad, as others say... it smells natural and not laced with chemicals), and it is gorgeously packaged.   I apply this at the end of my skin routine after washing, toning, hydrosol and serum.. then pat and press 4-5 drops into the skin. It leaves my skin glowy and fresh, and has a mild drying effect on red or inflamed areas.  Do your research and look up the effects of Blue Tansy on skin.. it does those things, and this product is awesome.

BUT! this is the ultimate skin irritation savior. it is amazing for any kind of acne and it does absorb into the skin with some time. I had used a mask that started making me break out immediately after I rinsed it off. I decided to apply this heavily to my face and massage it into the affected area. after about a couple hours the irritation and bumps were 70% gone and by morning they were completely gone without a trace. I will be keeping this in my arsenal without a second thought. if you have any kind of acne or easily irritated skin, this is a must!"

I've been using it consistently day-night for 2 months, barely made a dent in the bottle, and have seen overall, less irritation and redness during breakouts, no more flakey angry skin, and it helped plump up some of the faintest fine lines near my mouth that I attribute to skin dehydration.

I was the person who had a 12 step skincare routine trying to cure persistent acne, hyper pigmentation, and also get that glow that people with perfect skin have. I have the kind of skin that doesn't really break out from products but just nothing changes...ever. I've tried everythingggg from the drugstore and switched to expensive Sephora skincare and still no acne changes. Bought this 3 months ago (wanted to make sure it was actually this product before I go raving) and guys...I HAVE NOT HAD ONE CYSTIC ACNE SINCE. I do get one pimple the week before my period but I just dab a little extra on it and it's smaller the next morning. It has actually helped speed up my breakouts! I went from 12 steps to just my Lush Herbalism face wash (I only use at night though), my toner I make myself (witch hazel, tea tree oil, lavender oil), Kiehls midnight recover eye cream, and this oil. I'm now that person that people compliment how glowy their skin is which I never ever thought would happen. Haven't worn foundation since and the last time my face was this clear was before puberty. This has tremendously helped balance my skin and increase pigmentation turnover. I use this day (3 drops) and night (5-6 drops) and it soaks in just fine. I've actually changed my skin type from extremely oily to normal. Like what are you serious. I was nervous for the added coconut oil but I'm glad I decided to push through the scare. Please try!"

I came across this product by chance and decided I'd try it since it said it was ideal for combination skin types. I was shocked at how well it worked within the first couple of weeks. I had always been skeptical of all natural products because I always had this weird theory that products with chemicals and preservatives would be more advanced and more effective. I was so wrong in this case.   Within the first week, my skin wasn't producing nearly as much oil as it usually had, any inflammation and redness in my skin disappeared everytime I applied this, and whenever I had a bout of hives on my face I would apply a healthy dose of this oil and pat it in my skin. It would came my hives right down. I use it during the day mixed in with my moisturizer so it doesn't make my foundation look greasy and I get a nice layer on at night as my last step of my routine.   My boyfriend has extremely sensitive and acne prone skin. He is using a retinoid cream to get rid of it that is causing extreme irritation, redness and flakiness in his skin.

I am a natural redhead who's got the typical thin skin which is prone to redness and I am SO happy for what this has done. I am always on the search for products which can help me switch to not needing much make up and I truly think this has helped. My skin has absolutely improved (probably with the help of that magical Tansy stuff) but I would not doubt the power in this little bottle. I was using Belif before (still use the problem solution cleanser) and if I had some sugary food or dairy I would break out the next day, and I thought to myself well that means I'm not using the right stuff still. Somehow this has changed things! My skin has cleared up no matter what I eat! Please give this a try and see what you think. I can't tell how long it'll last but no matter what I'll just rebuy it.

The products make make-up application more difficult and sometimes have permanently stained clothing.   I can't say I'm completely acne-free. I still have some issues with blackheads on my nose, but I haven't had a single pimple on my face since I started using this product. I occasionally get a pimple on my neck and when I dab this stuff on it it is gone the next day.  So. All that is to say if you have had a similar experience I highly recommend trying this.

I'm 31, I've had acne since I was a teenager. My skin cleared up drastically in my early 20s but it's been horrible ever since I had babies and my hormones went nuts. I've tried everything. Any three step skin care regimen I could find, from expensive subscriptions to more affordable drug store products, oral and topical prescriptions, you name it. This oil helped my skin more in ONE NIGHT than years and years of all that other stuff. So while I can't give a FULL review because it has only been one night, I can tell you with certainty even the change I saw in one day was worth the cost! Just try it. Seriously."

I've been using this regimen for about 2 weeks and I cannot believe the difference in my skin. I have no new acne. My active acne is going away. My overall skin texture is completely changed. My skin is smooth and soft; my rough texture has completely disappeared. My redness has gone down and my hyper-pigmentation seems to be fading. This is more than I have ever wanted to spend on skin care, but I will gladly spend this over and over again if I keep getting these results. I'm absolutely amazed!"

Retin-A also leaves your skin a bit red, as if you have a slight chemical burn, and oil feels very soothing.  I've always wanted to try it but the large bottle at Sephora is expensive. I found a smaller version in a perfume rollerball style bottle at a local store for $30.  I LOVE this stuff. It clarifies your skin, gives you a glow, is light yet hydrating, and soothes inflammation.

I'm early 30s and struggle with break outs. I used it the first night, and the next morning my skin looked almost clear and skin tone was amazing. Each day it gets even more flawless. I'm 2 weeks in and My skin looks amazing even with out make up which is crazy. (I haven't gone with out it yet, but definitely could) By mid day, the oil in my t-zone is minimal and I really don't need to touch up my make up.  Tip: I use the 10 drops at night, then I only use about 5-6 drops in the mornings. I also tie my hair back until the product had pretty much soaked in. It was making my hair greasy and I would break out where my hair touched my forehead if I went to sleep right after application. Waiting about 10-15 min with my hair pulled back seemed to do the trick and no more breakouts along the hairline."

No new blemishes, closed comedones have vanished or are shrinking, old spots are healing and even months-old post inflammatory hyper pigmentation spots are already fading.

I have stubborn hormonal acne on my chin and after reviewing my skincare routine, my dermatologist suggested the coconut oil in this product could be making my acne worse. I was heartbroken because this oil is fantastic for calming irritated skin and shrunk existing spots and faded acne scars almost overnight. However, I did notice that little bumps would pop up on parts of my face where I don't normally get acne (i.e. forehead, cheeks) while I was using this oil. In conclusion, I'm taking off a star because I think it's a bit odd to have coconut oil in a product for acne-prone skin, but I would still recommend the Lapis oil to anyone who won't break out from the fractionated coconut oil."

I'll be reviewing Luna oil at a later date. The oil looks heavy but actually it is quite lightweight and the absorption is decent. If you have dry skin like me, the oil will soak up faster but with minimal application -- a few drops -- all skin types can work this into their routine. The blue tint does not show up on the skin as much as in the Luna oil and the fragrance is fresh. If you didn't know, tansey oil comes mainly from German Chamomile flowers. Don't quote me on that...  I love that the silky oil glides easily over my skin without any sticky residue and it's made out of natural ingredients -- plus it's cruelty-free. Also, I found that it's soothing on the skin after a facial or glycolic peel due to the azulene element. Azulene used to be a spa secret back in the day. It was applied on the skin after peeling or waxing to cool the irritation and redness. I always had a hard time finding Azulene oil so I'm glad it's available here. I would consider buying this in the future although the price is not something I'm keen about. The upside is that the oil will last you a long time and the gorgeous glass bottle and dropper applicator are additional cool features."

I've tried Luna, Artemis, Argan, Argan Light, Tsubaki, Pure Truth, and more. I used three drops at first, but it absorbed so effortlessly I kept adding more even thought my skin felt instantly moisturizer. Ten drops absorbed flawlessly and after a mere 3-5 minutes felt only like I had put on a deeply nourishing cream, with no oily residue at all.  Blue tansy is also one of my favourite ingredients. Although I don't have much redness, only a few blemishes here and there, I find it really helps calm and even my skin.  Love!"

I got the travel size from Herbivore, but will definitely purchase the larger size once warmer weather comes since I will probably start using this one day and night!"

I used to apply benzoyl peroxide on breakouts and it would dry my skin out terribly, but those days are over now that I've found this!"

This oil does not clog my pores, even in the T zone and I closely inspected it! Having combination skin, products tend not to clog my cheeks, but I couldn't use anything on my T zone. I had no moisturizers for my T zone before I bought this.  While this gives me perfect moisture for my clog-proned T zone, it is not rich enough for my cheeks although I still feel comfortable using just this all over my face. It is not a dry oil like the Nude Rescue Oil, which is a bit too dry as an all over moisturizer. It is thick enough that there is a protective layer that glows on your skin, but has never clogged my pores. This makes my skin look healthy.  If every facial oil seems to break you out or clog your pores (plain jojoba or fancy mixtures) then definitely give this a try! If you have drier skin, you should probably layer with this one. If you have oilier skin, this is the best! My combination skin loves it all over. I just have to add some extra layers on my cheeks. I am so glad Sephora is carrying beautiful pure and natural brands like this. I never used to buy skincare from Sephora until recently. Definitely a must-have now."

And until I tried the Herbivore Lapis Oil, I had yet to find a day-time moisturizer that didn't make me look greasy or break me out. I stumbled onto this product when I did a search for oily skin oils. I have tried Argan, Marula, Maracuja, Camellia, and Coconut oil. ALL were just too heavy for day. This Lapis Oil is very, very different. It only takes two drops to cover my entire face!  Pros: -Has stopped my face from over-producing oil (my oil no longer breaks through my makeup.) -A little goes a long way (Just know that too much, and it will sit on the skin) -2 drops covers my entire face -Takes about 2-5 minutes to completely absorb -No moisturizer needed (for me, the Lapis Oil gives the perfect hydration) -Pleasant smell that dissipates in a few minutes -Slight glow without looking greasy -Soothing, calms the redness in my cheeks -Helps to puff my forehead lines so they are less deep looking -Fantastic as a makeup base (like a primer, but not greasy). I've used powder and fluid foundation with no problem. -Does NOT make me break out. Does NOT clog pores.  I know it's a bit pricey. But at the rate I'm going, I expect this to last at least 6 months. It is super concentrated. Just be careful not to drop the bottle, as it's made of glass.  I am VERY pleased with my purchase and am so thankful that I found a product that hydrates my skin perfectly.  Also, I found that the Perricone No Foundation Foundation Serum applied over the Lapis Oil is a winner! My skin looks flawless without looking greasy, flat or too matte."

This makes it a great fit for my combination skin. It hydrates the dry parts just right without causing my T-zone to get overly greasy.  This oil smells like jasmine (think the smell in jasmine green tea) due to the jasmine sambac in the ingredients. It's more floral than I like, but the scent dissipates quickly. The icing on the cake is the pretty packaging and the fact that this is a BIG bottle that I'm sure will last a long time! Definitely recommend."

So I decided to search for an all natural brand and found Herbivore Botanicals a few years ago. This oil is what brought back my confidence about my skin! As well as having acne prone skin, I suffer from hyper-pigmentation and my acne blemishes/scars stay for 2-3 months before the redness goes away. It was so so discouraging feeling like my pimples were just adding up, when in reality, I'd only have a few spots, but the residual hyper-pigmentation made it seem like I had many many more. BUT, this oil was the one and only thing that helped reduce redness and the sensitivity of my skin. While the oil doesn't seep into my skin as well as the Phoenix Oil(which is also AMAZING) when I use this oil at night, I can look forward to waking up in the morning and seeing my redness being SO much lighter. This seriously has helped fade my spots so much, and it has worked wonders for the dry winter months. If you have oily or normal skin, it might be daunting to use more oil on your face, but if you don't use too much, and massage the oil into your skin, you'll just be left with hydrated skin. If you're like me and have drier skin, you can always add a few more drops for a more dewy finish. It also doesn't cause me any irritation or make me break out. This oil is seriously amazing, and I HIGHLY recommend the whole Herbivore Botanicals line if you're looking for a healthy, all-natural skin care line that is actually effective!"
