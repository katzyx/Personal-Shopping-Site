Think expensive and updated Irish Spring and Old Spice with a brightness. Definitely a scent that we both agreed would be best for late 20s onward and reminded us of a man who is ambitious, motivated, and cares about their appearance. The scent can be worn both day and night and it has great lasting power. This is a head turner without being invasive. Love!"

The bottle itself is a work of art, paying homage to European craftsmanship with its solid shape and timeless design. It embodies the essence of masculinity and adventure, serving as a fitting vessel for such an extraordinary scent.

            "review_text": "This cologne smells absolutely incredible! It's marketed towards men but I fully believe women can wear this too! It's earthy and sensual with warm, woodsy aspects that all come together to make an intoxicating scent. It opens with the Bergamot which comes off crisp and fresh..as it dries down the Vetiver and Patchouli come through, Patchouli can sometimes be an overwhelming note but this one is PERFECT! It just adds a bit of spice and isn't overwhelming whatsoever! It comes off classy and sophisticated while also being sexy and mysterious. This is an absolute winner! Highly recommend this scent and Mountblanc in general, when it comes to scent, they never miss!!"

Whether you're going out for a formal event or simply want to feel confident and alluring throughout the day, this cologne has got you covered. One thing that I particularly appreciate about this cologne is its packaging. The bottle itself has a substantial feel to it, with a unique design that stands out from other colognes on the market.

Many would say with good reason that it is a Creed Aventus clone, even though it is more square and less subtle in its approach.  Bottle design is amazing and of high quality.  It is a great fragrance for all occasions, as it is not too powerful and is suitable for all seasons. The only drawback is its performance, as it doesn't last more than 6-7 hours on my skin.  Nonetheless, I do recommend!"

I cannot tell you how great this smell is. You just have to try it for yourself  However any time I wear it women either follow me around or chase me down to know what it is.  I'm a little heavy on the spray So when I'm at work it fills the halls and all the women love it...!!!  And let's face facts. That's the only reason we buy cologne right To attract women. And there's no better scent then explorer by Mont Blanc..!  I wouldn't buy anything else.  And the only reason your reading my reply is because my store was out of it. And I've had to buy it online  But wanted all the guys and girls to know how awesome and amazing this scent is.  Thank you  PAUL.O"
