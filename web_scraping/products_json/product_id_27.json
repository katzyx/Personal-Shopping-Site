            "review_text": "Iu2019m beginning to not trust any product review on Sephora. I filtered out all incentivized reviews and purchased the Rose Clay color hoping this would be a natural, long lasting lip liner. Upon arrival, it looks nothing like the photos. It is actually a light brown color on the stick and on my lips, hand, and wrist, it is a nasty yellowish orange. No rose tones whatsoever. The only good thing? It wasnu2019t long lasting at all. Wouldnu2019t recommend this liner."
