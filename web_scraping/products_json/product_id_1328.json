Upon comparison, I believe I have a fake as the P is off, no sticker, less refined seams on the sides of the bottle and the plunger/dabber mechanism is completely different. Upon arrival, the box had a lovely scent but much different from what I had believed was the scent. The small splash had leaked some and there was black residue that appeared to be from the lid floating at the top corners and when I used my fingers to wipe the liquid around the lid. Ironically aside from the residue, I enjoy the dupe more. There is a overall roundness in scent after the dry down that mimics PP but they are different enough. The bevel on the fake was nicer on the cap but not enough to not make me feel duped for thinking I could get the real thing for a typical price for the size. I only sort of wish I had more of this fake as the scent is nostalgic for me. I would still have wanted to try this fragrance and glad I did from Sephora and is my first Prada purchase. The travel vial is hearty in my hand and is nice for wanting an all over mist. Bottle is charming next to other minis. Would recommend."

I hadn't worn scent in decades because many people abuse scent and others have allergies. I fell in love with its soft, sexy, fresh femininity. A tiny squirt lingered on me all day and even after bathing! I ran out, but when I check prices, I was appalled by how expensive fragrance has become since the 1990s. Plus, I never made my way through an entire bottle back in my days of Lauren by Ralph Lauren and Happy by Clinique. When this travel size with the dabber became available, I jumped on it, and I'm so glad I did.    For those whining about the dabber, why?  This set was just a few dollars more than the travel size alone, so I jumped on this great value.  Now I always look for the fragrance samples from Sephora when I place my orders."

It didnt make sense to me at first because the pricing looked way too good to be true. As a 50ML is over $100. The 30ML travel size is $43 on its own.  Anyway Ill be returning this because who wants to pay $10 for a dabber? Not meu2026"
