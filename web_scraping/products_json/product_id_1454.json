However, it's more expensive and the while the scent is light and clean, it reminds me of expensive diaper cream."

Over the last few years it's become extremely brittle and breaks easily, falls out by the handfuls so now it's super thin, top half doesn't seem to grow anymore, dry, wavy, just awful and I don't know what to do at this point. I used a box of G hair dye about two years ago and by the time I was done putting it in my hair I started smelling my hair burning so immediately washed it out and contacted the company. Turns out it was expired and they offered nothing, no help whatsoever. My hairs been awful since. This product smells great! Clean and fresh, neither feminine or masculine. You only use 2-3 pumps to put in the mid section and ends and tie your hair up loosely at night. I don't think my hair is fixable at this point so I can't really say I've seen much of a difference except it doesn't seem as frizzy. It doesn't leave your hair greasy or anything and doesn't need washed out which is a huge plus. I'll continue to use what I have and hopefully can see a difference and update my review."

I put it on my hair damp and again my hair was soft in the morning. I normally wash my hair every other day but by the end of the day my hair felt greasy.

Unfortunately, it was not enough moisture to replace the serum I already use, so this would have to be more of an add on to my routine."

It tends to get dry, especially during winter. And in the humidity it gets thicker (expands) and frizzier and gets hard to control. Plus, with this ridiculous summer heat, the last thing I want to do is stand there drying my hair under a hot hot blow dryer. However, blowing it out seems to be the only way to make it silky smooth and not frizzy. But this product seems to do the trick!! Iu2019ve tried it a few times on dry hair before bed. I was worried that I would wake up with really greasy hair, and oil all over my pillowcase, which could also lead to skin breakouts ( this has happened  before with other oily hair serums). This serum is very light and did not leave any oil behind and it did not make my hair greasy at all. In the morning after using this overnight my hair is super soft, smooth, silky and no frizz! I would definitely recommend to give it a try."

I also thought that it did seem to make my hair less frizzy when I wake up in the morning. I did find that because my hair is so long, I did use 4 pumps instead of the recommended 2 pumps. I thought that 4 pumps was just the perfect amount to fully spread it in my hair. Overall, I would recommend this overnight serum to my friends and family."

I received this product about a week and a half or two ago and Iu2019ve used it 6 times so far. I used it after washing my hair before bed. I also tried the wavy hair tricks it recommends. My hair is a bit long (almost waist length) so I used between 2-3 pumps. This serum is very light and has a delightful aroma. I let it sit overnight and in the morning my hair is soft and shiny. Iu2019ve had multiple people compliment my hair since I started using this product. I will definitely be purchasing this product again and make a mandatory step of my hair care routine!"
