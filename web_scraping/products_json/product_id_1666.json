All in all, I'd say that this product performed amazingly, I just had a few minor things I think could be improved.  First and foremost, this product claims to be waterproof. I put this setting spray to the test during a particularly humid day and my makeup remained flawless throughout. Whether you're dancing the night away or caught in unexpected weather, this spray locks in your look without budging. The application is really simple and the spray nozzle produces a nice fine mist that covers your face in a thin layer. Definitely don't forget to shake it first and don't spray too close to your face. It doesn't leave any sticky residue and dries down quite quickly. I think this is the purpose of the alcohol denat. in the ingredient list, but I do wish this extremely drying ingredient wasn't in there as it's not great for dry skin. It also contains fragrance, which isn't great for sensitive skin either. However, I do really like that the formula is vegan and free of parabens and sulfates.

This is the only setting spray I truly trust for ultra hold in the sweltering heat (I do appreciate and love summer weddings but man, I get sweaty watching nuptials out in the sun!) and I feel like I'm less likely to need a touch up when I use this spray. If you're looking for a dewy or matte finish, this may not be your best option but I feel like this gives a neutral finish which is so versatile. Glowy base? This isn't messing around with it. Matte to the nines? No problem, we're just setting and forgetting. Even if I venture out to try something new (in the name of testing!), I will always find my way back home to this waterproof setting spray."

What I like to do to get the maximum amount of long lasting coverage, is once I am finished my face makeup, like foundation and bronzer, I will spray in a circular motion around my face. Fan myself to let the setting spray dry, and continue on with the rest of my makeup. Once I am done with the rest of my makeup, do a final layer of setting spray, let dry and good to go!  It really is amazing how well this stuff works, it really does give you coverage that lasts hours. I am not sure if I would say it lasts 16 hours like it advertises, perhaps if you were not sweating or touching your face, but the average person does, and I know I am guilty for it too.

This setting spray is definitely a necessity in my makeup routine.  - Product received for free from Urban Decay Canada in exchange for an honest review."

For my test I used a few different products and brands, with different consistencies (ie. more cream and powder based products) including eye liner, lipstick, liquid contour, concealer, power blush, powder bronzer, and mascara.  I noticed that this setting spray did especially well locking in the powder products. With the creamier products, this setting spray really needs to dry down to get the best staying power. Overall, I would rate this setting spray an 9/10 since it keeps the products vibrant and extends the longevity of the makeup really well!

This product truly lives up to its reputation for keeping makeup in place all day long.  One of the standout features for me was how light it felt upon application. Unlike some other setting sprays that can feel heavy or sticky, the All Nighter spray goes on with a fine mist that feels weightless on the skin. It's almost like you're not wearing any setting spray at all!  In terms of performance, this spray really delivers. My makeup stayed flawless from  morning until night, without any smudging or fading. I was in NYC the week I tried this, and even in the humid conditions, the All Nighter spray held up remarkably well, keeping my makeup looking fresh and vibrant."

It's perfect for summertime and keeping your makeup sweat proof. If you want to wear makeup to the beach or the pool this setting spray will be your best friend.

I put this product to the test on the hottest, most humid day we have had here so far this year...and was left very impressed. I also used this over my daughter's prom makeup, which lasted from morning to night..through humidity, dancing and sweat!  This spray really does prolong the wear of your makeup. I applied it in both a T and X motion on my face as per the directions. This setting spray is lightweight and comfortable on the skin. It dries quickly and doesn't leave you feeling sticky or tacky. The nozzle on the bottle is great and makes application easy. It comes out in a fine mist, so the product is pretty evenly distributed. Its alcohol free and doesn't dry out your skin.   A few sprays of this setting spray and my makeup stayed allll day, even in the awful humidity. I have a terrible habit of touching my eyes, so my eye makeup never lasts. When using this setting spray my eye makeup didn't smudge and lasted all day. There was no noticeable fading or settling into my fine lines.   My only suggestion is to spray before mascara or to make sure your mascara is dry before applying.   After multiple uses I can see why so many people love this product. Its perfect for special occasions or humid weather. It really keeps your makeup looking fresh so you dont need to have frequent touchups.    I will definitely be buying this in the future  - Product received for free from Urban Decay Canada in exchange for an honest review."

I'd say the spritzer on this spray is moderate - it's not so fine of a mist that I can barely feel it but also not so watery that I feel like I'm being hosed down. The fact that I can feel it certainly helps my awareness as to whether I've covered all areas of my face. And well, I'm not sure anyone likes being hosed down haha.

            "review_text": "As someone with dry skin, I often struggle to find a setting spray that can keep my makeup looking fresh all day without causing my skin to either dry out even more or get too oily. This setting spray strikes the perfect balance. The fine mist is incredibly lightweight and doesn't feel heavy on my skin. After applying my makeup, just a few spritzes are enough to lock everything in place. I've noticed a significant difference in the longevity of my makeup; it stays flawless and vibrant from morning until night.   One of my favorite things about this spray is that it doesn't leave any sticky residue. My skin feels soft and breathable, and there's a natural, dewy finish that adds a beautiful glow. Plus, it has a pleasant, subtle fragrance that isn't overpowering. It made my makeup completely  smudge proof but just make sure to drench your skin with the spray. It definitely works."

I applied my makeup at 10 am, and after a full day of ceremonies and an after party that lasted until 1 am, my makeup didn't budge at all.  The spray felt lightweight and comfortable on my skin, and despite the long hours and various activities, my makeup stayed fresh and flawless. I did notice a slight stickiness when I first applied it, but that quickly disappeared as it dried. The scent isn't my favorite, but it's a small price to pay for such incredible staying power.  Overall, Urban Decay's All Nighter Setting Spray exceeded my expectations and kept me looking picture-perfect throughout my special day.

Even with dry skin, makeup will eat itself due to oil production and the environment, or just stop looking so nice after a while. Not to mention Canadian weather is not makeup friendly.    This does work. I find my makeup settles into place better and lasts longer. I do need to skincare properly ahead of it all, or my skin will get tight after a few hours."

While it initially set my makeup beautifully, I noticed that my skin started to feel shiny after just a few hours. Despite its reputation for keeping makeup in place all day, I found myself needing to blot and touch up more often than I expected. If you have oily or combination skin, you might need to pair it with a mattifying primer or powder to get the best results. On the bright side, it has a nice lightweight feel and a pleasant scent, making it a solid choice for special occasions."

I purposefully paired it with eyeshadow that was chunky and glittery, and I knew wore off more easily as I truly wanted to see what the spray was capable of. In the total 10 hours spent with it applied. I was outside for a good amount of it, on one of the hottest days yet this summer at 33 degrees out. I cleaned the car and sweat like crazy. And by the end of the day, my make up was understandably very worn but I was very happy with how much eye shadow was left! I touched my face many times without my makeup transferring.

I wanted to try it and voila.  My impression: I gave this setting spray a good test drive, and it passed with flying colors. I wore it on a hot day, went for a walk, did some shopping, threw water on my face, and my makeup stayed put. ud83cudf21  I used it again for a night out into the early hours, again tossing water on my face and my makeup stayed in place. It was non-drying and gave my skin a bit of a glow.   The only part of my makeup that didn't last was my lip gloss, I had a feeling it was asking too much, so I still needed to reapply after an hour or so.   It actually takes a little extra effort to wash off, instead of a double cleanse a triple may be needed. This will be my go-to setting spray; they do have a few different finishes to choose from and the one that I tried is the real skin finish. There is a dewy glow finish and I think I'll go for that next because I'm addicted to more glow.  Got it free from this is butterly and urban decay in exchange for my review."

I was very excited to get the opportunity to test out the claims knowing my brother's wedding was approaching - an event that would have me laughing, crying, and managing multiple temperature extremes from sweating it up on the dance floor to freezing (literally) my face off with ice packs after hitting it force into a pillar. She is beauty, but she never ever claimed to be grace.   I managed to make it through the night, even though the testing for the All Nighter was extended beyond what was planned. The setting spray not only met but exceeded my expectations. After a long night and even after getting a concussion, my makeup stayed exactly where I had carefully applied it 12 hours earlier. There was no transfer onto the pillar either (yes, I checked!).  The spray itself is a dream. It is lightweight, quick-drying, and comfortable, perfect for my sensitive skin. The mist is fine and even, effortlessly locking in my makeup without altering its finish. Despite dancing and stressing about the injury, the only glow I had was the one I applied on purpose. The spray made sure any additional oil or shine was kept under control, while my highlighter stayed in place.   Having used setting sprays before, I understand the struggle of finding one that's truly worth the extra step. All Nighter has proven to me that its five-star reputation is well-deserved, especially for events where long-lasting makeup is a must. I was able to forget about my makeup with a few quick spritzes, and it was nice to have one less thing to worry about on such a big day. Of course, reapplication of gloss was required throughout the night, and because it worked so well, removing my makeup at the end of the night was more involved, but I think that is worth the tradeoff.   - Product received for free from Urban Decay Canada in exchange for an honest review."

So I used this over my makeup the other day before going out in the sun for the afternoon, and I really do think it worked and held up against the heat! I can imagine it'd be great for before a night out too, not that this mama's going out at night anytime soon, hahaha!

What truly sets this setting spray apart is its staying power. The setting spray has makeup staying perfectly in place from morning until late at night. I didn't need any touchups, even on a particularly hot and humid day. Its patented technology is supposed to lower the temperature of makeup, and there is something to that as both cream-, powder-, and oil-based products stayed put.  Another thing I love about this product is that it doesn't dry out my skin. The Urban Decay formula kept my skin feeling hydrated and fresh. Plus, it didn't cause any breakouts, which is always a plus for me.  The All Nighter Long-Lasting Setting Spray has a subtle scent that isn't overpowering, and the bottle comes with a double cap to prevent any leaks or messes. Plus, its vegan and cruelty-free formula ensures it doesn't exclude any makeup lovers from having a fresh face that stays put until you're ready to remove it.

Here's why it stands out to me:  This setting spray truly lives up to its name. Whether I'm attending a full day of work, running errands, or enjoying a night out, my makeup stays put from morning to night. I've tested it in various conditions, including humid and hot weather, and my makeup remained intact without any significant smudging or fading.  One of my favorite aspects of the All Nighter Spray is the finish it gives my skin. After applying, it leaves my face looking fresh and slightly dewy without being shiny. It seamlessly blends my makeup, eliminating any powdery residue and giving my skin a natural, flawless look.  The spray feels lightweight and breathable on my skin. It doesn't leave any sticky or greasy residue, and it doesn't clog my pores, which is a significant plus for someone with combination skin like mine. I also appreciate that it's oil-free and doesn't contribute to breakouts.  The spray nozzle dispenses a fine, even mist that covers my face in just a few pumps. I typically hold the bottle about 8-10 inches away from my face and apply in an u201cXu201d and u201cTu201d motion for full coverage. The product dries quickly, allowing me to go about my day without any delay.  A little goes a long way with this spray. Even with regular use, one bottle lasts me several months, making it a cost-effective addition to my makeup collection.  The scent is subtle and pleasant. It's not overpowering and dissipates quickly after application, which is great for those sensitive to strong fragrances.  Overall, the Urban Decay All Nighter Makeup Setting Spray has exceeded my expectations. It's a reliable product that ensures my makeup stays flawless for hours, providing confidence that my look will last as long as I need it to.

Don't get me wrong, it reduces the smudge and transfer, but the smudging and the smearing still happen.

One downside is the smell u2013 it's kind of nasty, probably because of the alcohol, but it fades quickly. Despite this, the spray feels like nothing on my skin, with no tacky residue.  Longevity is where this spray shines. I wore my makeup for about 10 hours, and it still looked fresh. Urban Decay claims it lasts up to 16 hours without fading, cracking, smudging, or setting into fine lines, and I can see why.  The packaging is sleek and sturdy, with a matte black bottle, lavender writing, and a purple mister. However, my mister spewed large drops instead of a fine mist, which might be a one-off issue.  I don't wear super heavy makeup u2013 just BB cream or skin tint, blush, lipstick, but always eyeliner. This setting spray keeps everything in place perfectly for my routine.  As for the price, it's on the higher end, but considering how well it performs, I think it's worth if you want to invest in a good setting mist.

Sadly, it didn't quite hit the mark for me. The second cap felt completely unnecessary, and the scent was a bit too chemical for my liking. The biggest disappointment? It smudged my makeup, which is the opposite of what it's supposed to do.   There's definitely room for improvement here, especially considering I've used other setting sprays that perform better and are more affordable. I usually love Urban Decay products, but this one just didn't work for me.  - Product received for free from Urban Decay Canada in exchange for an honest review."

My entire face was just as fresh as when I did it in the morning. It's great that it is also waterproof which helps a lot with sweating or taking your makeup from day to night. This is now a permanent replacement for other setting spray.  I recieved this product free in exchange for my honest review."

I tested it with a white cloth after wearing it for about 8hrs and no makeup transfered to the cloth which was impressive! The only thing I don't like is the scent. It does go away after awhile, but you can smell it initially when you spray it on your face. Definitely recommend it though if you're looking for a good setting spray!  - Product received for free from Urban Decay Canada in exchange for an honest review."
