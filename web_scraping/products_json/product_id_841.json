            "review_text": "I bought this set because I love the cleanser and exfoliating treatment and have used them for years, but I wanted to try the moisturizer.  The price for this set is fantastic as the cleanser is full size and if bought alone is $44. So this set is a great value. Keeps my skin looking smooth, even toned, brightened and keeps the pores clean of any buildup. I love the moisturizer, its a gel and spreads easily and sinks right in and creates a nice glow and base for makeup. I would buy this entire set again."
