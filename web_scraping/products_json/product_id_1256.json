The detox shampoo is fine- but nothing special where I would repurchase it again. The leave in conditioner is just terrible- i canu2019t believe I havenu2019t seen any other reviews talking about how bad it smells hut the scent is so incredibly strong and bad. It actually hurts my stomach if I spray too much of it. If it had some crazy awesome benefits on my hair then I could potentially work past it but itu2019s very drying and my hair feels very straw-like after using. Maybe this is something that only works for certain hair types, but this is not a good match for me."

The fragrance from the detox shampoo lingers in my hair most of the day after showering. I can tell that the shampoo and leave-in conditioner will last me for a long time, considering a little goes a long way.   Keep in mind that the detox shampoo is a clarifying shampoo. So you'll want to only use it once a week or as often as you feel you need product build-up removed from your hair. Do not use this shampoo excessively, as I have seen some reviews mention hair loss from this particular product. This is a normal potential side effect of using clarifying shampoo too frequently."
