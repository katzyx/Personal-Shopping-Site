I would only recommend this cleanser if you are on the oily side. even with a heavy moisturizer, no exfoliating, and this gentle cleanser, my skin was dry, a little irritated, and didn't leave me a nice canvas for makeup."

It eventually became the same consistency as water which made it difficult to use it as a cleanser at that point. I double checked to make sure the cap was on tight and that shower bottle wasn\u2019t coming in. That wasn\u2019t the problem. I ended up throwing out half a bottle out because of this. I\u2019m reluctant to purchase another one. Maybe it isn\u2019t meant to be kept in the shower?"

I apply this a night and sometimes in the morning  as well! I have to say that lotion is needed after this because it leaves your skin feel pretty dry, but with my birthday sample I also got the super food air whip light weight moisture cream and it felt so weightless and amazing on my face!

But this gave me full on fungal acne - it was itchy, huge pimples in groups (it looked like cystic acne), red. Going from pretty good skin to how this broke me out was literally a 1 to 100. People I saw in my everyday life were asking me what happened to my face lol. I stopped using it and after a week my skin was almost back to normal. However, I will say that I didn\u2019t read what it\u2019s actually MEANT for before using it, and that is my fault so giving it 2 stars. The advertising & description for this product does state clearly several times that it\u2019s intended for oily & acne skin, both of which I don\u2019t have.

I even find salicylic acid cleansers don't work as well as this - but I still switch back and forth between a PH balanced salicylic acid cleanser & this one based on my skin's needs. It's not amazing on white/black heads, but if I have oily pimples, discolouration, angry spots - this works wonders on those! I will definitely be buying this again"

As part of the Sephora Beauty Community, I pride myself in writing honest reviews, no matter if the product was gifted or not.  At first, I wasn't sure what the big deal about this cleanser was...however, after a few uses, I noticed my skin felt softer and looked a little healthier! So, I kept using it and found myself always reaching for it!  This cleanser effectively removes makeup and makes my skin feel really clean, but not stripped! It feels so nice and refreshing on my skin, I actually really enjoy using it and look forward to it! I love that there's tons of antioxidants and other great ingredients for skin. I have no idea if any of the ingredients help repair the skin barrier, but I feel like the antioxidants may have helped because I get a tiny bit of redness on my cheeks...but now, it seems to have really calmed down! I really like the simplicity of this cleanser...just a great, no frills gel cleanser that lathers really well...so a little goes a long way!  And, I love that there's no scent besides a natural ingredient scent, at least not that I've noticed, so anyone with allergies to scent should be fine!  The glass bottle is a nice touch - yes, even the mini size is glass! And, I think it's great that you can buy a Full Size Refill pouch! The only thing that I didn't like about the Mini size is that you have to pour out the cleanser, which can be difficult while trying to hold onto a smooth glass bottle with wet hands, but that's a small packaging detail.  My skin is happy and healthy with this cleanser, so much so that I ended up buying the Full Size (with the Pump) so that everyone in my house could use it, and Everyone loves it! This cleanser will definitely always be a repurchase!"

It also has a very nice, light, fresh scent.

            "review_text": "I did receive this product for free as a Sephora Beauty Insider Ambassador, however these are my own opinions. This is an effective cleanser that I've tried out a few times over the last five years. I do tend to prefer this in the summer months when my very dry skin is a more normal. While it's not stripping, it's certainly not hydrating either. I have a love hate with the glass bottle, it's quite pretty and I love that glass is so much easier for me to recycle. That said, it's also a jar that I won't keep in my shower, I'm not the most clumsy, but one wrong move and this bottle would shatter against my tile. I use this as a morning cleanse, something easy that I can still feel like I did a cleanse with, or as a second cleanse at night after using a balm or oil to remove most of my make up and SPF. I have in a pinch used this at night to take off my make up and SPF, however I do find that I have to really concentrate on massaging it into my eye area to get mascara off. This can at times lead to getting soap into my eye, so the double cleanse method is easier. I will say, I prefer to double cleanse at night for this reason with any cleanser. If I'm not wearing make up, this works fine to get SPF off on it's own. Consistency is great, comes out of the pump easily but is thick enough that it doesn't run everywhere. There is a scent to it but I can't really say that it smells like Kale, Green Tea or Spinach, it's more of a fresh green scent, reminds me of freshly mown lawn, but you really need to get your nose into the container to smell it. I do not notice the smell when I'm using it at all and I've used it to wash my hands to see if the smell remains. I can't smell anything on the skin after rinsing it off. Overall this is an easy product to use and purchase, I never regret spending money on it, but there isn't a big wow factor for me, but I'm not sure what kind of a wow I'm looking for in a cleanser either. Sometimes just being a solid product is good enough for me."

I also found that a little product goes a long way! It smells deliciously green, and although it was a tiny bit drying, it didn't strip my skin the way some cleansers do.

I had heard it had been reformulated so I was interested in giving it a try when I received it as part of a gratis package, hoping it might be less drying (or really, not drying at all) on my dry and dehydrated skin as the original formulation.   Unfortunately, that was not the case, though to be fair, it felt slightly less harsh on my skin than the original formula. After using it for a couple of weeks, I found the product to be too much for my skin type, and will be either passing this product on to a relative with oily or combo-oily skin for which this cleanser will be better suited or I\u2019ll repurpose it as a brush cleanser.   This is my honest and authentic opinion, as a Sephora Beauty Insider Community Ambassador.   WHAT I LIKE:  * Consistency - water based gel texture  * Lathers up nicely  * A little goes a long way  * Contains some good-for-your-skin ingredients   AREA(S) FOR IMPROVEMENT:  * Would love to see this cleanser be less stripping and drying on dry or very drying skin, maybe if there was a creamy, milky version of it?   FYI:  * Makes a good second cleanser  * Scent - faint, herbaceous, medicinal  * Glass bottle  * Best suited for those with normal, combination - oily, oily or very oily skin tones. Too drying for those with dry or very dry skin.   BUY \ud83d\udecd\ufe0f or BYE\ud83d\udc4b\ud83c\udffc?:  * In the winter months, my skin is dry and dehydrated, and this cleanser is too drying for it so it\u2019s a pass for me. BYE. However, if your skin leans more on the oily side, this cleanser might be worth looking into."

I\u2019ve been using this cleanser since middle school (I\u2019m a senior now) and am JUST beginning to run out of my last 8 Oz ( just got the 16 Oz for Christmas!). It\u2019s last me way longer than any other cleanser, and I always get compliments on how clear my skin is (minus breakouts every now and then related to hormones and athletics).   PROS: It has a refreshing feel, minimal scent, foams really nicely, takes off makeup efficiently, and you really only need a small amount and a little water to get a good lather.   COMMENTS FOR DRY SKIN: People say this cleanser is too drying, but as someone with dry skin I disagree. As long as I\u2019m only using it once a night, and follow up with a moisturizer (which anyone should do regardless of skintype!!)- my skin looks and feels great.  CON:  My only gripe with this product is the pump that comes with the 8 Oz. Sometimes I find that after pumping, it ends up leaking excess product, and that a whole pump is WAYY too much for my face. I recommend just using the cleanser as is, with the screw on cap and only pouring a dime sized amount onto your hands.  Even then, that\u2019s not so much an issue with the cleanser, but rather just a minor packaging detail that is completely optional to use."

I have oily skin but I found it to be stripping and the moisturizer wasn\u2019t very great, and didn\u2019t hydrate/made my skin look dull. I had a good skin care routine before switching but I found out that brand animal tests so I had to switch, and I was hoping that this would live up to the reviews but unfortunately not. It seems as though this line works really well for some people, but for people with acne and oily skin it might not be the best. I have a lot of acne scars and I found the moisturizer dulled my skin which made them more prominent. It smells very fake, like a shampoo you would get from a hotel and the price tag is just too high for what it is.   (disclosure: I am using prescription benzaclin cream and I have acne prone skin)"

I was first introduced to this cleanser from a Sephora digital event masterclass so this isn\u2019t the first time I have tried the product. I would definitely recommend it for someone who has sensitive combo skin or if your skin leans more on the dry side.  A little goes a long way as you apply it because it does change from a liquid to a foam after gently applying it in circular motions all over the face. It was easy to wash off and didn\u2019t feel like it tugged or dried my skin out like some other cleansers do.  The only thing to be cautious about is that the bottle is glass so it could easily break if knocked over. Also, the smaller size doesn\u2019t come with a pump or a dropper."

I bought the value pack and it's a really good cleanser, it's diminished my acne and honestly has helped my face appear brighter. I follow after with serums and a hydrating moisturizer. This would probably be a good cleanser in the summer bc my skin is drier during the winter-- hence the strip feeling.

Personally i've tried out a lot of brands before like CeraVe or La Roche-Posay  and both made me break out even more. This is the only cleanser that i've tried for a significant amount of time that has never broken me out so bad. Even when I have traveled to other countries, this stays consistent. I do recommend however that if you're new to it, to try the travel mini since I know for drier skin it may be a problem. Always try out small so you don't have to waste all the product. Hope my review helps you all!"

First I will say this is not by any stretch a BAD product, just seemingly over priced and overhyped (I am stealing this from someone else\u2019s review title I scrolled past so ty). It is IMO comparable to a number of cleansers that I have purchased at my drugstore, of which some I would actually prefer. On the positive side it did not make my skin tight or dry like gel cleansers can sometimes do and had a nice soft lather. It does not smell bad, it smells nice and clean but it is in no way a standout either direction. The bottle is nice substantial glass (I have the refillable size). So if you have a lot of money and want a NICE cleanser \u2026buy this. If you want to get a bit more bang for your buck I might look elsewhere."

First; my face was not dry nor oily after use, like normal with other products & soaps I've tried in the past.. and i did not follow instructions correctly the first time \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2640\ufe0f...    Keep in mind, Altho I have extremely sensitive skin, i don't suffer from acne, just oily skin. Thus all I truly use is dove soap water and Palmers coconut.    And so, for the past few days in a row, i was drinking soda, and also did some deep winter cleaning. So my face is breaking out!  First use, my face began to clear up.. I did not try it again untill 3 days later (why, idk. My life is a mess sometimes). But this time I've been very consistent and so far - 4 days later, I'm digging it..... Only thing I noticed different from the first time I used it is how slightly dry my face gets.  But I believe that's do to the soap I use (dove) after"

It doesn't strip the barrier from the skin, so your face doesn't feel tight, dry, or uncomfortable. To remove SPF, I recommend cleaning your face twice.  The best part is the clean smell, it definitely smells natural, so you feel good about using the product. In fact, I look forward to using this every morning and evening."

I'm thinking it's the added fragrance that did it for me, I just don't understand why skincare brands are still adding perfumes to their products, it's so unnecessary and serves zero purpose for the skin. The ingredients found in this cleanser don't warrant the price either.

This was at the top of every list on Sephora\u2019s website for those two complaints so I figured it was a no brainer to purchase it. This broke me out HORRIBLY within a week of starting to use it. I had painful, itchy acne that seemed to appear every day, the texture of my skin became a lot more rough/bumpy as well when using this. At first I thought maybe it was just a normal monthly hormonal break out and continued to use it hoping it would resolve itself\u2014 as my skin usually does. However, my skins condition got so bad that I had to visit a dermatologist and purchase prescription skin care. Needless to say, I\u2018ve discontinued using this. WEEKS later, my skin is finally starting to recover from whatever horrible reaction I had while using this cleanser and the moisturizer. I did not notice a difference in my oiliness/pore size while using this, it seemed to have the same affect on those things as my usual cleanser (which is half the price). Would advise caution to anyone who is thinking about purchasing, unless you\u2018re someone with money to throw away."

It works. It cleanses your face. The biggest negatives I have are the price point, it left my skin a bit tight, and if I accidentally got some on my tongue, it tasted like the soapiest, grossest thing I've ever experienced.  Full disclosure: I'm a snob with makeup and skincare (and a grocery list of other things). I'm careful about what I put on my face, near my eyes, etc. So I was content buying this because it had great reviews and clean ingredients. But like, $40?? Are you kidding me? There are so many other products you can buy. I've learned that you should splurge on serums. But a solid cleanser and moisturizer do not need to break the bank."

Southern California has had disgustingly hot summers lately, and I love washing the day away and using this in the shower. My skin is clean and ready for nighttime skin care. I don't feel like it strips it dry. The herby smell took a little bit of time for me to get used to but it's all good. My husband says my face smells like a green smoothie after I use it. \ud83d\ude02 My dermatologist recommended it also.

I took one star off only for the price, although I do really like it, the price may keep me from repurchasing it as there are comparable cleansers with clean ingredients as well, at cheaper price points. Although rotating it with other cleansers & using around once a day/every other day, there is a good amount left after 2 weeks. It wouldn't last as long being used daily or as your only cleanser, but if you don't mind the price I definitely recommend it!"

On days I don\u2019t wear makeup, I go straight in with this cleanser and it takes off all my skincare products and sunscreen very easily, but without ever feeling like it\u2019s stripping my skin. I\u2019m also a big fan of the packaging- the glass container makes it feel more luxurious and I prefer pumps over squeeze tubes for convenience. Personally, I don\u2019t mind fragrance in cleansers and I found the scent to be very nice."

Second picture is a month and a few days in. I still have blemishes, but they aren\u2019t angry, infected and dry anymore. They heal so fast since using this cleanser as well.  I get hormonal acne HORRIBLE and this cleanser along with my SolaWave tool has saved me beyond words. My skin is typically really dry and very oily and now I\u2019m hydrated and glowy. I only got the small bottle and I\u2019m def going to repurchase the big one bc wow. I\u2019m a huge skincare fanatic and I\u2019ve used SO many different cleansers. This is the one. If you\u2019re hesitant, get the small one. But thank me later. Your skin will love you.

Not to mention the fact that the color and smell is amazing. It does make my face feel tighter, refreshing, and clean- however, I have a dry skin, and this make my skin feel tighter in a dry way afterward (you can see the flakiness below my nose). I would say it's a bit overprice for its quality. I don't feel that much different. Another thing is that it doesn't effectively remove my makeup. Especially, eyeliner. I can see why though. This is a gentle and clean cleanser, so nothing surprising. I found that by using cotton pads to wipe of the foam help removing my makeup (a great way to see if there's any makeup left or not). If you wear light makeup, you'll be fine. For anyone wearing waterproof or somewhat lots of makeup, consider purchasing a makeup remover. Overall, it's a great product! It did what it supposed to do. So that's why I'm rating it 4 stars. Oh- did I forgot to mention the fact that it's clean and vegan (+ no fragrance)? I'm in love with how effective it is compares to the other gentle cleansers out there. Just 1 star off for overprice and unable to remove all my makeup :))"

So far this month I haven't had 1 cystic pimple related to hormone changes which never happens and the only skincare change I've made is this cleanser and a couple weeks later adding in another YTTP product.

Big mistake. My skin is pretty resilient--in fact, I can't remember the last time a product caused a reaction like this--but the Superfood Cleanser gave me a bad case of contact dermatitis. I had scaly, dry patches above and at the corners of my eyes, my eyes themselves were irritated, and I had an itchy rash on my chin and around my nose. It had to be caused by this product, because I introduced nothing else new to my routine. I have to wonder if some of the people in the reviews who say this broke them out also were suffering from contact dermatitis, since sometimes it looks like little whitehead pimples. After a few days of using cortisone cream, my previous First Aid Beauty cleanser, and Cerave and Skinfix moisturizers, my skin is finally doing better, but I feel far more wary about Youth to the People as a brand now. I normally steer away from fragranced products like those by YTP and am put off by brands attempting to make money by using trendy but meaningless terms like superfood, but I gave their products a try because I appreciated the mostly glass packaging, which is more recyclable than plastic. I will use up the YTP products I already own but will think again before buying more."

I did not specialize in skin care rather I looked for anything to get rid of my acne. I\u2019m embarrassed to say at times I would scrub my face with pure alcohol just out of desperation. This face wash is everything in one. It smells wonderfully, adds moisture to your skin without it being oily, really cleans deep into your pores to minimize texture and pore size, and all in all wonderful to use. I like how much this moisturizer lathers with water and I love the company and what they stand for. I promise you will not be disappointed!"

Then two applications of this soap works beautifully to remove the rest.  Only a faint make-up residue from my hairline areas is leftover on my white face towels.  In the mornings I find I don't need to wash my face usually; slept in my face creams and ready to add to.  I do get adult acne extremely easily.. macne and you name it.. as well as flakey in some patches.  This leaves my face clean and soft.. and hydrated.  No acne side-effects.  And has light green tea lovely scent.  Can you tell I'm a fan?!!  I like it :D"

However, once they reformulated the product I found that it had become irritating for my skin causing breakouts, thus starting my search for a new cleanser. With all the good things I had heard about this cleanser I had so much hope but was sadly let down. The sent is quite pleasing and it forms a beautiful lather but those are about the only good things I have to say. This cleanser caused me to beak out in several places I have never gotten blemishes such as my jaw, chin, and across my forehead. This product simply didn\u2019t work for me, nor do I think it\u2019s worth the price tag!  (I have normal-oily, blemish prone skin!)"

So far it seems this is actually improving my skin. I use this as my second, and morning cleanser. It smells nice and gets a decent lather. It is non drying and I have had no reactions to it, and I would know the morning after first use if I would. I\u2019m also prone to CC\u2019s and everything has been going great in the respect as well. It leaves my skin clean but soft and bright. I got the mini to try on a whim and I plan to purchase the full size when it\u2019s gone; I like it that much. If you have an allergy to any of these ingredients I would of course avoid it. I mostly use Asian exclusive skincare and have yet to find a cleanser I truly like that\u2019s not in that category until now. Very excited and the full size has a pump!! Could not be more excited about this product and it makes me want to give more of this line a try."

You\u2019re face feels clean, refreshed, yet hydrated just enough to feel no tightness and smooth as silk; especially after my Farmacy makeup melt away balm! Those two are a winning combo before bed after wearing makeup. I\u2019ve been trying all sorts of cleaners but I find myself going back to this one day and night. I will say I do not JUST use this, I use it as my second wash. I alternate between the first wash and then use this after. But it\u2019s awesome! If you\u2019re more minimal I would still say you could use just this and adore it just the same. I have more oily, terribly acne prone skin that gets red easily and this helps with all of the above. Highly recommend!!"

It\u2019s gentle on my rashy skin, and when I have the energy to keep up my skincare routine, this pared with other products seem to help with the rashiness.   My issue is with the container it comes in. I love the style of the container, but when the container and contents are in a warm environment (like a hot steamy shower or an non-airconditioned bathroom) the pump acts as a siphon and large amounts of the product are lost overnight. This cleanser is not cheap, and it sucks to lose a third of the product to the shelves in my shower rather than my face."

I put it on a silicone face scrubby and massage my face and neck in circles -- In the shower, it's great to do behind your ears and such as well. This cleanser leaves you feeling super fresh and clean without stripping your skin away until it's so dry that you start getting more acne. My skin was breaking out like crazy from masks at my work..... lol. This has completely saved my skin! You are able to use it both morning and night with no issues as long as you are keen on moisturizing afterward :)"

The lather is lovely and the packaging is fairly sturdy (the lettering can come off over time which is a peeve of mine.) I originally bought the travel size and used it while going abroad. I was delightfully surprised at how much I enjoyed using it and how much my skin liked it. I\u2019m a bit of a skincare junkie so once my trial size was finished up, I moved on to another brand. But then months later found myself missing this so I ordered the full size! Just finished the full size and will be restocking."

That being said, I got the opportunity to test the mini version of this cleanser through YTTP in exchange for my honest opinion & it lasted me much longer than I thought it would. An amount smaller than a dime is more than enough to create a beautiful silky lather that feels so soft on the skin. Each person is different so I by no means want to say other's experience with this cleanser is wrong but I have normal-dry skin & this cleanser did not strip my skin in the slightest, rather it left me feeling fresh faced & soft. I wouldn't categorize this product as moisturizing nor like previously stated, drying, but it gets it's job done. If you've been eyeing this product but are hesitant on buying it because of the mixed reviews, I'd honestly say it's worth a try...buy this mini & test out whether it's for you or not :)"

It always brightens my skin whenever I use it, I love the way it glides on my skin and does not irritate it either (my skin is very sensitive) Beautiful 5 stars  KEEP IN MIND THOUGH: one of my biggest mistakes in the skin community is believing everyone has the same skin, please see if you have oily, combo, dry, normal and etc skin!! Know your skin to treat your skin properly :)"

Plus it made it easier to remove my makeup, I will admit that I had to keep lathering it into my face to get all of the makeup off but I didn\u2019t have to get more product to remove it.

Love this stuff, my skin always is considerably less red, plus I wake up the next day and my face looks and feels noticeably better! You look forward to using it if you have any kind of irritation. However, after consistent use, though my acne was nearly gone, my face began to feel very dry and tight. A thicker moisturizer or oil would probably compensate, but since I'm sensitive to heavy creams, I ended up switching to Krave's Matcha Hemp Cleanser, which feels the same but doesn't foam, so is less stripping (and a lil cheaper lol) Still, I recommend this one to anyone who asks, especially if you are on the oily side! I think it's the best cleanser at Sephora and still might come back to it in the summer."

Other brands like Cerave give me deep pimples with no head for example, but this doesn\u2019t irritate my skin like that. BUT I do not think it\u2019s effective all on its own. I recommend The Inkey List oat cleansing balm first, and then this for everyday if this face wash works for you too. I think this is just a normal, nice, decent face wash that most anyone could use !! I still struggle with acne so personally i will be switching it out of my everyday routine for something that will target my problems better, but i will forever keep it in my routine for when i need a nice gentle cleanse <3"

The pump never worked which really defeates the purpose of its entire packaging. Overall I'm not impressed and it's not something to recommend at least not for me anyway. I am a black woman with combination normal to oily skin for some insight. I'm going to continue to use it simply because I paid for it but it really doesn't do anything super spectacular for me."

It doesn\u2019t remove makeup tho so u need to double cleanse with makeup remove or micellar water first which is a bit annoying.   The packaging sucks tho. While I appreciate what they trying to do with them being glass instead of plastic, it makes them a bit dangerous. I don\u2019t like having to worry about dropping it bc it gets slippery when wet. Also according to reviews their pump design is awful and i don\u2019t like the screw cap either. So i solved that problem by buying some cheap plastic 6oz bottles with flip top on amazon to store the cleanser in and then just refill it from the ytp cleanser bottle. I would suggest ytp use a plastic bottle with a flip top on it for the smaller size and then only use glass with screw top for the large refill bottles."

The person who recommended it said that it would leave your skin not stripped and refreshed....no. my skin felt so stripped afterwards and i was rushing to put on my toner each time i used it. used it up, never again, no please go spend a good $36 dollars elsewhere, personally i like the inkey list salicylic acid cleanser or the tatcha deep cleanse"

Based on that alone, I love everything about this cleanser except the the price which is unnecessarily high. It really does smell like green veggies and that scent doesn\u2019t linger after rinsing. Although it\u2019s a gel cleanser, it also reminds me of a cream cleanser in the way that it doesn\u2019t heavily foam. It does become white and slightly foamy when lathered. I had it around my eye area but never felt any burning. It cleans really well without drying out the skin which has been refreshing for me since right before using this I was sampling the AC Collection foam cleanser by CosRx which often left me feeling on the dry side. I\u2019ve been using this every AM/PM for almost a week now and I would honestly buy it if the price wasn\u2019t so high. Hence, the reason why I takeaway a star."

I did experience some breakouts with this. For reference, I previously used Clinique all about clean liquid facial soap oily skin formula. You can save roughly $17 on your cleanser!

If you travel a lot I recommend the small ones to take with you. Fun tidbit also: I live in a place so cold your eyelashes freeze, and I forgot a bottle of this in my car for a few hours, so it obviously froze. Good news is the bottle didn\u2019t break and it melted back to normal!"

For how expensive it is, it hasn\u2019t made my skin any better. In fact, it\u2019s made my skin more dry and I break out more often. I gave two stars for its ability to remove makeup pretty well, but I do go in with a micellar water as a first step. With that being said, this cleanser claims to prevent buildup in pores, yet I still have clogged pores, despite always double cleansing, exfoliating and taking great care of my skin. I know that just happens to many people no matter how great their products might be, but it\u2019s an odd claim from a cleanser that also doesn\u2019t claim to be non-comedogenic either. It seems to break many people out, myself included. For almost $40 I\u2019m not impressed, and once again, gentle and basic drugstore brands have it beat. I\u2019m not sure what to do with the remaining product because I really don\u2019t want it to go to waste, but I also cannot afford to keep breaking out and feeling dry. :/"

In the winter I do need something more moisurizing so I use Ethique Bliss Bar (also love!). Between these two cleansers I feel set. This cleanser does have a mild fragrance, which I would usually try to avoid, but it's a wash off product and my skin doesn't seem to mind. Will continue to repurchase!

Of course, if you get the odd blemish, you\u2019ll need something a little more aggressive. However, this has been the perfect everyday cleanser for me."

Besides the price, another reason why I was so hesitant is because of the small amount of fragrance in the ingredients. I have super sensitive dry skin, and products with fragrance never fail to break me out. This product has not! It's actually helped clear my skin, and does not leave it feeling stripped/dry.

My skincare journey has not been an easy one, and I\u2019m always struggling to keep my skin in it\u2019s best shape possible. Let\u2019s be honest, we all struggle with this, right? Well, my skin is combination skin and I find it that if I use a moisturizing cleanser, my skin is so oily!!! Switch it up, to a cleanser for oily skin, and my skin is SO dehydrated! Yet this cleanser is my holy grail to anyone struggling with any skin troubles. I\u2019ll start with technicalities of the bottle design. Few people say they have troubles with the bottle leaking, now I\u2019ll let you in on a little something\u2026 it\u2019s very unlikely for that to actually happen. I mean, there\u2019s so many people that it hasn\u2019t happen to. Don\u2019t let that be the reason you don\u2019t buy it. The design is really smart actually. It looks very nice sitting on the counter, and one pump is the perfect amount to completely wash your face nicely! Now, for the actual cleansing. It is so amazing. I love to have a cleanser that you can feel clean your face, but not strip your skin of any oils. This is great as long as you throw on a moisturizer on after (as you already should be doing), so I can\u2019t complain about it drying your skin. Also, it really gets in your pores and sucks out all that dirt and leaves your skin feeling neither dry nor oily. This honestly is the best cleanser I\u2019ve ever used and I\u2019ve used too many to count. Something else people comment on is the smell and I don\u2019t know why? The smell is so pleasantly clean and natural, not irritating or fragrance heavy. I honestly love every aspect of it. The glass bottle is so nice, the smell is lovely, and it not only works but it preforms BETTER than other cleansers. The price is justified as it will last, so if you\u2019re considering purchasing this product I hope it\u2019s no longer a question. Buy it, you\u2019ll have no regrets!"

I resigned myself to dealing with constantly clogged pores forever. Enter this amazing product about a year ago. What a change in my skin!  I was amazed from the very first use at how well it had cleansed my pores. Full disclosure, I used to spend SO much time in front of a mirror, squeezing my poor face, trying to extract all the sebum. Daily. I do still get some blackheads, but it\u2019s nowhere near the level that it used to be. My skin is so much happier now. I do have combination skin and struggle with dryness around my nose and mouth. The only time I have ever felt any sort of tightness after using this product is at the height of winter when my skin is just parched anyway. I have shared with several friends, and after one use they are in love as well."

It had a fragrance as soon as I opened the package.  Still I continued to use it, the cleanser just got more fragrant as I used it.  Some people might like the smell, but a lot of scents can trigger migraines for me so I stay away from them. Luckily I did NOT get a migraine from this scent.  The other thing I noticed after using it was how tight my skin felt afterwards.  That I really didn't like and doesn't happen when I use my Cerave bar.

I don\u2019t wear heavy makeup, but I do touch up eyebrows, use some concealer under eye on most days, and wear mascara.  I don\u2019t want to always have to use a makeup removing balm or similar product before using a cleanser.  I like this Superfood Cleanser.  It foams up a bit, which personally I like. It definitely does not give a stripped or drying feel. It does a good job of removing makeup, though if you wear a full face with eyeliner, eye shadow, full coverage foundation, etc this may not be enough on its own for you. The smell is pleasant (a clean smell, if that makes sense, as opposed to a floral fragrance).  Having said that, I personally like as little fragrance as possible, so I gave this 4 stars instead of 5, just because of my own personal sensitivity to strong smells.  Lastly, how awesome that they provide this in glass, with a pump.  Perfect packaging in my opinion and I wish more products came this way.  Overall, this is a great product I think and I would really recommend."

I have combination oily skin but I also struggle with ezxcema so I can get dry as well. It\u2019s a struggle bus let me tell you! Like anything else there are pros and cons.   Pros: simple ingredient list, vegan (so pretty natural based ingredients), barely any fragrance, does feel pretty clean after emulsifying and then washing face   Cons: pricey (I don\u2019t mind spending the money on good products for my face and I love how this brand does use nice ingredients and is recycle friendly but that dollar amount) even though there aren\u2019t any harsh chemicals or soaps to dry out your face. My face felt tight and dry after drying but still felt dirty in the t zone. For that reason alone is why I won\u2019t be repurchasing. Doesn\u2019t last as some other face washes I\u2019ve used in the past from other brands. Maybe that\u2019s because of the feeling of not being able to get my t zone to feel clean and refreshed idk.   I would reccomend this product if you don\u2019t have sensitive skin, acne problems, oiliness, or use makeup daily. This cleanser is very much for the non problematic skin type to wash out dirt, oil & sunscreen. If that\u2019s you, hit add to bag!! Hope it helps!! :)"

This product has a fantastic texture on the skin, and washes away quickly, easily, and completely. I also love the light, natural scent. I didn\u2019t realize how good this product actually is, though, until I had a reaction to a different clean beauty product. Within seconds of putting a different product on my face, my skin started to burn. I thought even washing my face would probably further the irritation because my skin felt so irritated in that moment. I reached for this superfood cleanser and within seconds my skin was cooled and soothed, all reactivity gone. This does more than clean\u2014it restores. I\u2019m a normal-to-dry skin type and I can use this cleanser twice a day without any issue. In fact, my already-healthy skin seems to become happier the longer I use this product. I do wish it was a little less expensive, but there\u2019s no question that it\u2019s a fantastic product, and it does seem that a little goes a long way so the bottle will probably last long enough to warrant the price. \u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f"

I've tried plenty of hydrating cleansers and this really is one that's actually hydrating.

However, in a recent Sephora order, I got a sample size (15mL) in a deluxe sample bag. I have been trying it out for about a week, both in the AM and PM. I don't notice a difference at all. It does what it's supposed to do but nothing exceptionally well. I would never drop $30+ to $80 on a simple facial cleanser like this one. I am happy to have received a sample, so I didn't have to waste my money to find out I wouldn't have liked it."

I sometimes wash my face twice if I have stubborn sebum but this works wonders!

I'm hopefully this will completely clear my acne in another few weeks."

I use this product to remove my makeup, even my mascara! The cleanser doesn\u2019t burn or irritate my eyes. In addition to the effective of this cleanser, I love that the ingredients are clean. I feel safe using this product as I know what it contains. I also used the sample of their Superfood Air-Whip Moisture Cream which was provided. It was enough for 2 days.

I tell all my friends about it so often I\u2019ve turned a few onto it. Ive searched years and years before finding this perfect cleanser. It makes your skin look and feel younger and hydrated. I feel so confident after using this cleanser. The smell alone will have you sold. Ive been using it for over two years now and I\u2019ll never switch cleansers again. I will tell people about it for the rest of my entire life. It really is the greatest cleanser ever created and I really hope every single person reading this tries it. At least try the 2oz sample one to see if you like it! Every single product they release is a fountain of youth in a bottle gold mine. You will feel and look younger and gain more confidence. Use it before your first date, before your big interview, before the first day of school or college, before a party, anytime you need that extra boost of confidence this cleanser will 1k percent help you out!! I personally guarantee you will fall absolutely head over heals over youth to the people not only with their superfood cleanser but ALL of their incredible products. I promise after you buy their face wash next thing you know you\u2019ll be instantly addicted and your cart will be FILLED with all of their immensely INCREDIBLE skin care products."

With this, I really feel luxurious and I know I'm now taking deep care of my skin.  Texture: It's a truly luxurious lather and silky smooth feel; it smells wonderful (nothing like it) and provides a real spa-like feel. So nice to use this after a work out and reset.  Quality: Ingredients are high grade and worth the cost. The bottle and pump is extremely high quality; I end up reusing the bottle for a ton of things.  Routine: My skin care routine is pretty minimal now since this takes care of so much of it. I usually finish it off with their peptide eye cream and I'm good to go. Highly recommend."

I have pretty sensitive skin so it\u2019s very difficult for me to find a product that doesn\u2019t cause my skin to react negatively, so this cleanser was a very pleasant surprise. After only 2 uses my hormonal acne started to clear and my rash and other redness is starting fade, my skin feels soft.

I also love the scent, light and fresh and not at all overpowering. A little goes a long way, also! So I think the price is well worth it considering how long it should last.

At first this did not impress me, but as I continued to use it, it's starting to grow on me and I'm leaning more towards liking it.

I tried a sample of Superberry Hydrate + Glow Dream Oil from a monthly makeup subscription and it was the first time I was able to use something consistently without it burning the skin or causing any irritation. I was excited but was still leery of their other items, but I tried the Kale + Green Tea Spinach Vitamins Superfood Cleanser. The smell (which is a big issue with products and my skin) was light and calming. I had no burning; the skin was not red or irritated at all. Sometimes it hits after a few days, but I have been using it everyday with no issues. The skin is clean and soft. My pores look amazing. My skin is healthy and happy. I would HIGHLY suggest this cleanser for any one with sensitive skin. It is nice to be able to have something that I can use consistently."

I\u2019ve noticed that the Superfood Cleanser takes the day off my face but doesn\u2019t completely strip it, which would otherwise kick off the overproduction of oil. I use this with the Kombucha Power Toner because the two products work really well together to calm my face down.

I only learnt recently of adding water again to my fingers tips and continuing to massage after 30 seconds. YTTP website details how best to use it. Doing this made the cleanser work much better. Sometimes I\u2019ve found this to be slightly drying but when I applied on wet face with wet fingertips, massaged for 30 seconds, wet my fingertips again and massaged for few more seconds, before allowing it to stay on my skin for 20-30 seconds and then rinsing off, I found it to not be drying at all! Love this cleanser.  Disclosure: while I have been using this for over 6 months, recently YTTP went me a sample for review which I was happy to do since I\u2019m already using the product."

I believe that the money is worth the luxurious feeling of using this cleanser because it bubbles and lathers without feeling excessive, and the scent makes me feel like i\u2019m at a spa. It\u2019s luxurious! But, it\u2019s tough to justify $36 on a cleanser unless you really care about skincare, and to treat your skin! I think it\u2019s worth the money to feel pampered.

I'm so grateful that my coworker recommended this and I recommend it to everyone I know, my mom even uses it now and loves it for her drier skin. I've been a repeat buyer for about a year now. A huge bonus that it is designed with minimal environmental impacts and all natural benefits (striving for that plastic free lifestyle).

This cleanser is one of the best I\u2019ve used since changing. It seems like all other cleansers dry my already dry skin out and I can feel the tightness and itchiness in my face with others even after all my serums and moisturized etc. the faint earthy smell of this cleaner I could smell all day! I wish it was a candle or air freshener! I love the way it lathers up after rubbing it in your hands and then onto your face. I feel like you really get a good clean if you\u2019re lathering it up right on your face for 60 seconds. Your akin just feels clean after you\u2019re done and can feel it. So smooth and soft like ready for the day! I\u2019d recommend this product to anyone looking for a good cleanser that doesn\u2019t have chemicals and is vegan and cruelty free! I\u2019ve actually turned my brother onto the brand and he loves this cleanser! He bought the giant bottle and when I went home about a month ago he was already half way through it!"

            "review_text": "This is a great water based gel cleanser. It foams, but not too much & is super gentle on my skin. I have dry & sometimes even flaky skin & I like to use their Dream Mask after cleansing for a boost of deeper hydration. The best way to use this is to apply to dry skin after getting a little bit of a lather in your hands with cool/tepid water. Gently massage 1- 2 pumps for ab 1 minute, adding cool/tepid water to your skin as you go (helps increase lather & efficiency). Rinse with cool water & if skin isn't too dry, I follow it with their Power Toner & Adaptagen Mist, then use the Air Whip Moisture Cream or their Adaptagen Deep Moisture Cream. There is fragrance listed in ingredients, but it's at the bottom of the list. Honestly, I can't smell anything with any of YTTP products. All of the YTTP skincare comes in glass jars, which can be upcycled or recycled. The glass is thick & hasn't broken on my tile floor. I have dropped it & it hasn't chipped or cracked. The cleanser comes in a mini, regular & jumbo size. I use the mini for traveling, the regular size (which comes with a pump) stays on my counter & the jumbo I keep stored & use it to refill the other 2 sizes.  I've tried other water based cleansers that make my skin feel squeaky clean, but not this one. It's great as a 2nd step in a double cleanse too. FYI: This is a cleanser, it won't reduce pigmentation or fine lines. It IS packed with vitamins & calming ingredients that help keep skin clear & in a more normal range. * #gifted but YTTP hasn't asked for anything in exchange*"

This cleanser is considered a cult favorite amongst skincare junkies and I was incredibly excited to be able to try it out for myself.   As the name would suggest, this cleanser is jam packed with a bunch of \u201csuperfood\u201d extracts including kale, spinach, green tea, alfalfa, vitamins C, E, and K. This cleanser has a thick gel consistency and doesn\u2019t foam up too much.   While the upfront cost of the cleanser is quite pricey at $36, the cost per oz isn\u2019t that bad at $4.   Since this cleanser is more so marketed for those with oily/combo skin, I was concerned it might be too stripping for my extremely dry skin; however, I was pleasantly surprised to discover that this cleanser worked for me! It thoroughly cleanses my skin without leaving my skin feeling tight and squeaky clean. This is probably the \u201cstrongest\u201d cleanser that I can use without making my skin overly stripped. I like to use this on days when my skin is feeling a bit oilier or more congested than usual or when I\u2019m wearing a lot of makeup to ensure that my face is completely clean.   I\u2019m a big fan of the Superfood Cleanser!!"

It does, however, help tremendously to keep acne from appearing (again, for me in my specific situation). I love it, and recommend it to everyone I know who is looking for new cleansers"

I know the price can seem a little high, but a little product goes a long way and the bottles last me nearly a year tbh. Every YTTP product I\u2019ve tried (and use) has absolutely been worth the cost.   My one complaint isn\u2019t with the quality of the product itself but with the pump/packaging. I love the glass bottle (I\u2019ve reused for plants, shampoo, etc), but hate the pump. If I\u2019m not careful and don\u2019t lock it after use, I noticed product drips out. I\u2019ve gotten around this by \u201cdepotting\u201d my bigger bottle into a smaller, travel-sized container, which works fine. Since I would only take off a half a star, I\u2019m still giving it a 5/5. It works amazingly for my skin which is my primary concern."

It\u2019s a foamy cleanser and a little goes a long way (I\u2019m talking half a pump is enough to cleanse your whole face and even your neck lol). Does a fabulous job at cleansing all impurities that accumulated throughout the day such as sweat, makeup, spf, dirt, debris, etc. WITHOUT drying your face out.

I\u2019ve spent a great deal of time trying to open the nozzles and despite my efforts I cannot switch it from a closed to open position. Although Sephora has been wonderful when addressing my concerns, the manufacturer needs to consider new packaging and a new way to dispense the product. I\u2019ve seen many multiple reviews online about issues with the pump. In the meantime, I\u2019ll be refilling my sample bottle so it\u2019s easier to handle. If you are interested in this product, save yourself the frustration of the 237 ml bottle and start with the sample size.

The smell in this was disappointing, less like a green juice and more like a green... water. I have sensitive, oily problem skin, and this cleanser was a bit too gentle to really do the job on its own. It also doesn't seem to go as far, either because there's less lather, or because I found myself needing to re-wash my face. I also think the glass bottle isn't a great idea for slippery bathroom areas with hard floors. It may work for you if your skin is more dry and you don't wear much makeup or SPF."

I bought one for myself, then immediately turned around and bought one for my mom and my brother who will otherwise wash his face with shampoo.

WELL... this was a skin changing cleanser. I know now what people mean because the moment I started rubbing it on my face, I could feel how good of a cleanser it was. There are no words that can explain how I knew but I know. This is my nighttime cleanser for double cleansing and I will never change from it. It is a pretty good price for 8 oz, most cleansers are only 6 oz and slightly less money. You don't need a lot of the cleanser either as it foams quite well- just make sure to rub on your face for at least 30 seconds!"

I got my first bottle in January and I\u2019m barely almost done with it. Considering the price and how long the product lasts, the price may seems overwhelming at first but it\u2019s a great investment. When using the larger refillable bottle the cost per use decreases a bit; making it a good investment if you enjoy the experience. That\u2019s all!"

It\u2019s so gentle (can go right over your eyes without stinging), and the thick gel really goes to work taking the grime off your face, unlike some other gel cleansers that seem to slick right off the surface of your skin and leave traces of makeup afterward (so annoying). I keep this in both my bathrooms. My fianc\u00e9 uses it once in a while and loves it too. A girl at the store once told me that her husband uses it too but she had to teach him to only use a half to one pump because he would put several pumps in his hand at a time. Lol! A little goes a long way. It also foams up a lot as you wash, which is rare for natural cleansers! Can\u2019t sing enough praise for this. But take note, if you don\u2019t like grassy/earthy scents, then this may not be the cleanser for you. I personally love it. Bought a bottle for my mom as one of her Mother\u2019s Day presents!"

I found it smelled a bit too strongly of fragrance for my tastes. If you\u2019re looking to shell out a pretty penny for a cleanser and you\u2019re curious about this one, I recommend getting the mini first. It\u2019s not really special or more effective than other cleansers, but that\u2019s just my experience. It\u2019s also glass, which can be a pain for using it in the shower. I don\u2019t want to step on broken glass or have the heavy bottle land on my feet."

It feels nice, I feel refreshed every time I wash my face and have purchased it 4 times already and also gifted one to my sister for her birthday.

I have sensitive skin and this hasn't irritated my skin at all, infact throughout this week my skin has felt comfortable (which is so nice to experience when you have reactive skin). My sister has combination skin and this hasn't made her more oily or dry but kept her skin feeling balanced . It's been a great addition to both our skincare routines.

An amazing product that I will continue to use and recommend! (P.S. I do not use this day and night 24/7! I use it every morning and about 3-4 times at night per week! I have it paired with The INKEY List Salicylic Acid Cleanser to help with my acne.)"

So I went back to this cleanser for the $12 bottle and like magic it cleared up my skin again! I know this cleanser works for me and now I don\u2019t care about the price so much cuz it gives results! I paid it with their yellow vitamin C brightening mask and my face is clear from dark spots and hyperpigmentation. They are a staple in my skin care routine. A little goes a long way because it foams up a lot with just a dime size amount so the bottle lasts me a month or a lol more. I see ppl say it strips their skin, perhaps their is an ingredient that does that for some but I always use this at night and apply their face mask with is very moisturizing. I say try them both out. One is 12 and the other is 15...take a risk!"

One of the very few cleansers that don\u2019t dry out my skin at all, and it\u2019s even made the bumps on my forehead disappear! It foams a lot too, so I only use half a pump (which helps make it last longer). It smells fresh and not like fragrances that are too overpowering or chemical-like. It\u2019s only been about a week but I\u2019m already noticing my dark spots are fading, and my face feels more hydrated and plump after every wash.

It's sad because the product feels so fresh on your skin and it smells good (for those complaining that the smell is gross, it smells green but in a fresh pleasant way). I have really sensitive skin and it didnt cause me any trouble other than the dryness.   You can also use half a pump to wash your face, its plenty, otherwise you will go throught it quickly. A bit overpriced in my opinion. I'd say its better for combo/oily skin. Theres better options out there in terms of price. Too much hype around it I think.

I loved it so I ordered the full size after about a week of using the travel size. The first couple weeks, it worked wonders for me & my skin honestly never looked that good. After a few weeks, my skin started to get very bumpy, which it hasn\u2019t done in almost a year. I think it may have just caused sensitivity (which I usually don\u2019t have a problem with), so I\u2019ve switched to using a gentle CeraVe cleanser in the morning & this one at night, but I haven\u2019t seen any improvement since I started doing that about a week & a half ago. In addition to this, the pump lid leaks horribly, so I wouldn\u2019t recommend traveling with that lid on if this face wash does work for you. I\u2019ll probably use the rest of this bottle just because of the price, but won\u2019t be repurchasing. Keep in mind though that everyone\u2019s skin is different, so what caused problems for me may still work for you :)"

Love how it foams and lathers without stripping the skin and is at a friendlier price point than other fancier brands (Glamglow, Tatcha). One star is knocked off because of the packaging. As there is no pump, the open bottle sometimes pour out more product than needed. I remedied this issue by decanting it to a small glass bottle with pump that I had on hand. Just wished this version also came with a pump or sorts!  FYI this cleanser isn\u2019t super beefy to take off waterproof mascara or sweat proof sunscreens, but is a good foaming and gentle cleanser for days where only light makeup is applied (some blush, tinted moisturizer). Personally, I use this as a second cleanse after my Heimish All-Clean cleansing balm for full-makeup days, or my regular cleanser for chilling-at-home days."

I do not use this at night, I use a cleansing oil and/or First aid beauty pure face cleanser to remove makeup and sunscreen.  A couple of notes: -if you are dry, this may be stripping to your skin, or leave it feeling really tight. -I would use this in conjunction with a pre cleanse oil or balm, this will not take off all your makeup and clean your skin.  Unless you use it twice, but that may be too stripping. -The glass bottle, although nice, is not travel safe or good to keep in the shower, can get messy."

It\u2019s not for removing makeup but good for the second cleanse following your oil cleanse. Leaves my skin clean, not tight and dry. I use it with my cleaning brush at times and it really gets my skin super clean. I have normal to sometimes oily, sensitive skin and this works great for me. It smells nice too, green and clean."

I expect a cleanser to leave my skin feeling refreshed, however, I know that a cleanser will not stop me from having breakouts because that is not the point of a cleanser (at least this one). I have combo acne prone skin and realllly like this. Compared to the soy face cleanser, its more purifying and deep cleaning. I do NOT use this to take off my makeup and the times I tried at the beginning of using this product it did not go well. As a 2nd cleanse it works great. Would not recommend this cleanser for dryer skin as I felt it to leave my skin deeply cleansed and on days I felt dry I'd have to go in with a hydrating toner and mist after this. Smells amazing, like a green smoothie!!! But a light enough scent that it doesn't over power my sensitive skin. Everyone with combo/oily skin should give this a try."

The packaging was a bit much but was kind of eco-friendly and the smell was amazing. I put so much faith into this product, but even after a few days I started noticing my skin was NOT liking it (I am a combo-type; dry/oily T-zone). However, I tried to blame it on the fact that it might have been in initial reaction to the detoxification, but decided to reach out to customer service on their Youth to the People website anyway and they were rude, blunt, and negative. So, if you purchase this or any of their products be prepared for curt answers if you reach out to them directly\u2014there goes your $36! After using it for over a month, once a day, I had so much in faith in it. But, my fungal acne broke out in just a matter of days and progressively gotten worse; no alleviation whatsoever. I just stopped using it and literally within 3 days my skin\u2019s already doing so much better. DO NOT BELIEVE EVERY HYPE YOU SEE ON THE INTERNET. Legitimately so disappointed."

All I use it for is to have a clean face to apply rest of skin care. If you are looking for a face wash that targets more things like acne I would recommend a diff. Face wash w/ chemicals that target that-I use the inkey list salicylic aid as well (which is why I\u2019m giving 4 stars) but if it\u2019s just a gentle cleanser this is perfect. I have combination skin."

I have rosacea (the kind that gives you small red bumps or pimples all over your cheeks when it flares up), and my face is extremely sensitive so any new product is a huge gamble. I also have kinda oily skin, which is unusual for people with rosacea. And even without the rosacea, I've never been immune to breakouts in other spots. Point is, I have a difficult face haha. During the pandemic, I made it my mission to find better products for my face than the drugstore ones I was using. First I tried Cerave - although it was still drugstore and not 'clean', I heard rave reviews. Within a week my face broke out with massive pimples everywhere, which were even unusual for me. I then tried another milky type cleanser from La Rose Posay, which was also doing the same thing to me, and it took me some time to realize it since I was using a new moisturizer too (lesson learned, don't try two new products at the same time).   Then I decided to try this cleanser. After almost three months of my nonstop breakouts, this cleanser finally helped clear them up. Nothing has ever really cleared up my face in the past - it is VERY stubborn. When it breaks out, or I get a rosacea flare, it lasts for like 6 months. But my face has vastly improved in the few weeks I have been using this cleanser. My skin is not perfect, but I don't expect one product to suddenly give me perfect skin. I think tweaking the rest of my skincare routine might get me there, and that's more hope than I've ever had about my skin. This cleanser is probably not for those with dry skin because I did notice a little peeling once but for my acne prone skin, it's been a life saver. Just make sure you moisturize enough and it's fine. I also LOVE that it's clean/without toxic ingredients, as I really wanted products better for my health and the environment. Such a great product, I hope it never changes :)"

One review caught my eye, someone mentioned that the new formula is terrible for sensitive skin now. I wish I had listened, my skin was sooo dry and parched it was flaking off. It stripped my skin of any moisture and hydration, leaving it highly stressed and irritated. I finally stopped using it and my skin improved over night.

It smells natural and usually I don\u2019t go for scented face products but in this case it washes off so it\u2019s totally fine. I\u2019ve seen a lot of complaints on here about the pump leaving a mess but I think people are just getting crazy with how they pump it. When I just popped it open I immediately started with a half pump and that\u2019s all I needed! It\u2019s super sudsy which I really like without drying my face at all! I have sensitive skin and I can tell my skin liked it right after I used it. I don\u2019t think I\u2019d ever be using any other face wash ever again! What\u2019s not to love? It\u2019s a glass bottle, great brand that is eco friendly, and makes your skin look amazing! I deal with redness and uneven skin tone and this is definitely the answer to my problems. I actually exchanged my Drunk Elephant cantaloupe jelly cleanser for this and if you ask me, for the same price, this is way better! You can definitely spend way less money if you really wanted a non sudsy unscented cleanser."

Since I\u2019m not using it daily I haven\u2019t noticed anything like drying etc, but based on how nice my skin feels afterwards I can\u2019t imagine it would be a problem. I can tell that there is no dirt or grime left behind, though I will say it doesn\u2019t work efficiently as a make up removing cleanser. Of course, that\u2019s fine as I don\u2019t believe it claims to be. If you use a little extra is does fine but I\u2019m not usually removing my makeup with it. Overall it seems relatively gentle but thorough for standard cleansing. I mostly use it in the morning. I think there is a decent amount of cleanser for the price of the 2 oz option.

My only complaint is that this cleanser is definitely not on the cheap side. 36 dollars, I do agree this is a really great cleanser, but for most people looking for an affordable cleanser, this is not one of them. Also, for the price point, I cannot believe that this has fragrance in it. My skin is extremely sensitive to fragrance (even in a wash off product), however I saw no problem with this cleanser but just beware. Try the vanicream gentle cleanser online, it\u2019s eight dollars and it\u2019s also extremely gentle.

I have combination skin that always thrive on clay cleansers but I gave it the benefit of the doubt and I'm glad I did. My skin doesn't feel tight at all after using this product and it looks great.   CONS -  1. I love the aesthetics of the package but the pump leaked on the first day. I had to clean the whole bottle with my handsoap to remove all the residue.  2. To avoid the leak, I have to press the pump all the way down which means I'm using more product than I need to. (I have a small face)  3. For the price of the bottle and the amount of product I'm using - this is quite pricey."

It allows face wash to accumulate on the neck of the pump and the face wash turns brown bc it\u2019s exposed to the air. Also the face wash that is in the collection part of the pump just below the cap turns brown on the surface which is gross bc that\u2019s the face wash that you use once you pump it. ALSO after I pumped some out, once I released it more came out onto the counter unless I was there to catch it, which is annoying especially since this face wash is so expensive. SO all in all I would recommend using the cap instead of the pump and just pour the face wash in your hands."

I use the ultra repair cream afterwards and my skin never feels dry, but if I don't moisturize, my skin will feel dry. I love how it is a gel that foams and it smells clean. A good price for what you get, much more worth it than the blueberry bounce by glow recipe, which I have tried. I also love the sustainable glass packaging.

It has now lasted me a few washes (and there's still about half of the bottle left), and I really love it!! It smells fresh, it cleanses my face really well (even takes off makeup!), and afterwards my face feels very clean and soft. I also love how it comes in a glass bottle instead of plastic. I'm actually planning to keep the mini glass sample bottle so I can use it as a travel refill for overnight or weekend trips!! Of course that means I'm going to buy the full size soon, too.

I contacted YTTP and they said to remove the pump and put it back in. To be honest, I\u2019d love for them to replace the wasted product caused by faulty packaging just because of the price.

Unfortunately, dermatology vids on youtube popped my blissfully sudsy, green tinted superfood gel bubbles.   I gave it three stars because I really enjoyed the smell and the feeling of doing good for my skin, and I always looked forward to using it and it would've lasted for a while. I discontinued because it was driving up my oil production (although not irritating my skin) and the videos online suggest that the antioxidants in this wouldn't make a skin difference. Without that it is a very basic, banal cleanser for a semi-luxury price. Oh well. Also, apparently perfume in skincare can cause a fragrance allergy, which would suck, so there's that :C YTP is NFM (Not For Me) QQ"

I don\u2019t know why this happens, if it\u2019s just me or not, but it gets everywhere and is extremely annoying and wastes an expensive super nice face wash."

I would describe myself as having normal to dry skin in the winter, and this cleanser could be just a little too much for my skin. It left me feeling pretty dry, so I did not like using it in the morning because I felt like I needed to load up on moisturizing products to counteract the dryness.

The tightness is not very bad compared to my previous cleanser. I enjoy the smell of this cleanser. It smells like what you should except knowing the ingredients in this. I also like how this \u201csudz\u201d up when washing your face! I haven\u2019t noticed any unusual redness (my skin gets red easily). This product is in a high quality glass bottle  I love this because it definitely wasn\u2019t cheap so it\u2019s feels worth the $. Glass is also better for the environment i. comparison to plastic.

This is just too harsh for me for daily use-however it will come in handy on those summer days where I\u2019m extra oily. And although it\u2019s too harsh for me on the regular I do reallyyyy like it. It\u2019s just pleasant. I love how it feels, I love the smell (like green grass juice)- I like the whole experience. I just don\u2019t like that overly stripped feeling. I also like how a little bit goes a long way- the smallest drop will lather like there\u2019s no tomorrow. So even though it\u2019s pricier it\u2019s worth it considering if you buy you will be using the same bottle for a long time. So to summarize if you have oily skin- buy it, maybe if you have combination skin depending on your preference for cleansers, but if you have dry skin I can\u2019t imagine you would like this. I wish I could use this more! But despite all this is a very unique cleanser and I\u2019m very glad I tried it."

Cons - cost seems a touch high, for a cleanser  - the scent is fresh and natural, from the ingredients itself, but I don\u2019t love it. I prefer no scent when possible.   A very similar alternative was the Farmacy Clean Bee cleanser and I\u2019m not sure which I love more..

Yes, this product is pricey. But because of its consistency, a little goes a long way. I bought the 8 oz in August, use it on my face and neck twice daily, and still have half the bottle left."

I think you would really love this product if you have combination to oily skin. I removed a star because it claims to be good for dry skin.... but I\u2019m not convinced. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s necessarily bad for dry skin, but for me, my face felt a bit tight after drying. It could also be due to the retinol im currently using."

Had to remove pump with a plier cause it was stuck in the bottle and ended up replacing with an old pump from a different product. Recently purchased my second bottle, I was able to put the pump in easily this time. My only complaint is that the pump has been slowly dripping in the shower every freakin day, there\u2019s been a bunch of cleanser wasted! I just don\u2019t get it, for the price I wished they designed the pump better. Otherwise, product is great!"

It smells great, lathers nicely and leaves your skin glowing and nourished. It simply cleanses a bit more deeply than my dry skin needs. By no fault of the cleanser, I\u2019ll have to find something gentler, but I will be gifting this for my people who do have oily skin and can reap its full benefits. If YTTP can ever release a product like this targeted for dryer skin, I\u2019ll be first in line!"

I have noticed my acne slowly clearing (it\u2019s only been a week and half). No new breakouts so far and all the active breakouts I had before using this are actively shrinking and some have disappeared completely. I always look forward to using this every morning and night. This doesn\u2019t take off all my makeup (it doesn\u2019t claim to) so I would recommend double cleansing (you probably should be anyway). Lastly, I love the packaging. The glass bottle is eco friendly and it comes with both a cap and a pump to switch out when you travel. Overall, great product. A very gentle and effective cleanser."

Even in the cold Canadian winter I can still use this, just make sure to pair it with a good moisturizer."

I usually use one after I cleanse but this cleanser made my skin so dry to the point where it was screaming for face cream after. I give it 3 stars because I love the way it lathers up and removes makeup. But if you have very dry skin, do not use this product alone.

Probably would be really nice in the summer when its more humid and for being anti-pollution.

Ingredients align with what the claims are, so you know it\u2019s not filled with anything that could be damaging or sensitizing for the skin in the long run. I recommend it to anyone and everyone!

It does a beautiful job of cleansing and nourishing the skin without being harsh or stripping. I find on days that I wear a full face of makeup I do have to use a makeup remover beforehand but on makeup free days this cleanser alone does an excellent job of making my face feel clean and hydrated at the same time. I have acne-prone, oily to combo skin and used to think that heavily stripping cleansers were the only way to keep the oil at bay. However, as I've gotten older I find that gentle products make my skin much happier and healthy looking. I find this cleanser does have a very slight, fresh scent but I think it is more due to the actual ingredients in the product rather than any added fragrance. Another strange phenomenon that originally put me off to using this product is the texture of my skin once I rinse it off. Before finding the superfood antioxidant cleanser I was so accustomed to having my skin feel stripped to the point of being squeaky clean. With this product, my skin had an almost velvet-like texture. At first I thought that it had left a film behind and tried to scrub any residue off, however it's not a film but softening affect on the texture of your skin! If you are looking for a new, cruelty-free, sustainably minded cleanser then I would highly recommend giving this beauty a try. I also can't wait to finish my bottle and repurpose it to hold my other bath and beauty products!"

My only complaint is the packaging. I love YTTP's stance on wanting to use more sustainable packaging, but the pump that comes with this cleanser bottle doesn't really fit in there... I had to force it in the bottle by hitting it with a hammer... and the pump did not function for very long after having to do that. I had to pry the pump back out 2 weeks later and buy another bottle to put this product in. That is probably due to fluctuations in the inside diameter of the glass bottle opening, I'm sure. But it just stinks I had to buy something else to hold this product."

I used to use Clinique (dried me out), then Origins frothy face wash (dried me out) and First aid beauty (didn\u2019t do much, didn\u2019t feel clean enough), and nothing else compares to this. It\u2019s such a simple face wash and the ingredients are great, but it doesn\u2019t dry my out or make me oily, and my face feels so refreshed and clean afterwards.

With covid19 and wearing masks got worst so I went to the dermatologist and she recommended retinol. The first month i wasnt seeing results from it because i know it takes a couple weeks to see results.. so i tried this by recommendations from hyram and let me tell you this is the best cleanser i have ever tried.

I'd be better off washing my face with hand soap from the dollar store. It doesn't remove makeup, it doesn't foam or lather well, and my face gets oily hours after using it whereas it takes a full day with CeraVe. I could never recommend this for the price. Maybe if it was $5 and someone didn't wear any makeup at all? *Shrug* I don't get the hype. I'll stick with my $15 bottle of CeraVe."

Firstly, it smells so amazing and fresh. I don't know how to describe the scent - it smells like fresh lettuce straight from the garden. It smells 'green' in a good way, very natural and leaf-y. The cleanser removes eye makeup without causing any irritation in your eyes. It is so gentle on my skin - my skin was burned from an at-home chemical-peel gone-wrong - and was incredibly sensitive. This cleanser did not irritate or burn my skin at all. Despite being gentle, it has been effective on my sensitive-combination skin - no breakouts and a visible reduction in black heads.  I can't recommend this cleanser enough. I will be continuing to buy it, despite the price tag."

It gets the SPF off and gently cleanses the skin and I'm left with a clear, smooth face that doesn't feel tight at all.

I\u2019ve been struggling with acne on my cheeks and around the sides of my nose since I\u2019ve stopped taking birth control a year ago. From pimples, to cystic acne underneath the skin, I wasn\u2019t sure what to do. I tried a lot of products and treatments (cerave, avene, la Roche posay, neostrata, cetaphil, Murad, dermalogica, drunk elephant, the list goes on). Now saying that, I gave each new product I used a month to see the results. Cerave seemed to be the line that kept everything at bay, but no great results (lots of bumps on top and underneath skin). I have combination, acne prone, and sensitive skin. Once I tried this cleanser in their mini pack, I will not go back. Within a week of use I was seeing results. My skin is now healing and my acne is almost all gone. I was quite surprised about how well this cleanser worked. It\u2019s gentle and cleans the skin without over stripping it. I also use this with the superfood air-whip moisture cream. I can confidently recommend this to anyone."

All in all great product, BUT THE RESTOCK OF THE BIGGER BOTTLES IS VERY SLOWWWW!!!

It's gentle, lightweight, and the smell is subtle.   Best of all, a little goes a long way. I initially bought the mini because I didn't want to overpay and quickly, I was surprised by how much lather I could get out of just a droplet. While I wouldn't call this anything miraculous, it's consistently reliable and does what it says it does.   That's miracle enough for me."

Since those initial breakouts I had when I bought this I haven\u2019t had any more, even during my period! The ingredients in this bottle really are worth the price. I also don\u2019t normally use gel face wash but I enjoy this one, it\u2019s gentle but still removes my makeup and sunscreen. I\u2019m purchasing the bigger bottle!

It is super light and feels like I'm rubbing velvet on my skin. The scent is very faint and fresh. I haven't experienced any sensitivity, break-outs, or any issues.  I've experimented with a LOT of cleansers but this one actually makes the cleansing process enjoyable!  I gave it four stars because I think it's a pretty high price point for a cleanser...

I just feel for what it is, that it is a bit expensive. If you have extremely dry sensitive skin this could work, but it may take your face a bit to get used to as it did for me. Should be a bit cheaper though."

I also like the fact that this had good surfactants (meaning it doesn\u2019t have SLS\u2014sodium laureth sulfate), and is good for the environment too.

The gel texture has a gorgeous soft feel that is gentle and the smell is pleasant like a green smoothie. But, I don't see any benefits like some other cleansers I'm using. So for those reasons, I don't see myself repurchasing this. Definitely try it still, at least the mini one, it's just not for me."

I do a double cleanse so I can't speak on the ability to remove makeup or sunscreen or whatever but it does get off any remains of my cleansing balm.  I like the smell and I like the consistency.  For me it lathers up a decent amount and I don't feel a need to use a whole lot, but I also admit that I don't care for products that lather a whole lot in the first place.  One of my biggest complaints is that it does tend to sting my eyes so I've just learned to be a little more careful when using it in my eye area.  I also love the packaging.  I know some people are worried about breaking glass bottles but honestly, the packaging is cute and very sustainable which I do like a lot.   Overall, it's a pretty good cleanser and while I do wish it were cheaper and wasn't as prone to stinging my eyes, I still think it's worth it's price."

I bought this about two months before I received my medication, I tried it on then and I was very regretful. So, for the past two weeks I\u2019ve been wearing my prescribed lotion and I figured I would give it a try again since my skin has (for the most part) cleared up. Unfortunately, the skin around my mouth and nose feels so dry and tight, and now I know for sure that this cleanser is definitely not for me. It\u2019s very drying and definitely not meant for sensitive skin (although it\u2019s marketed for that). I\u2019m not sure if anybody\u2019s struggling with either or of the two possible diagnosis that I have, but I want to save anybody who does the pain of paying for an over-priced cleanser. I gave it two stars, because the rest of my face feels fine. If it weren\u2019t for my eczema/pd, I might have considered sticking to this cleanser."

I have sensitive combination skin. I actually have to double cleanse with a different cleanser because this cleanser just from 1 wash actually doesn't remove any of my makeup at all and it still leaves a lot of residue. I don't recommend buying this cleanser because it's more of a cleanser you can use if you need a wakeup call if you're pulling an all-nighter. It only leaves the face refreshed for like a few minutes and that feeling disappears. It didn't really soak into my face but instead laid flat on the surface and then disappear."

This face wash doesn\u2019t overwork or irritate my skin and works well when paired with other skincare lines. Now the bad: it has little sud and I feel as if I use much more product to wash my face well. It does burn my eyes.

Sometimes I feel like the product doesn't fully wash off too because when I putting on a mask after completely washing off (or so I think) and drying my face, the mask will start to suds up a little as I apply the mask around.

I met with one of Sephora's skincare specialists to clear up my skin in Jan 2020. If you havent done this, definitely make you an appointment. I only tweaked one item. Shhh! Don't snitch. lol. My skin looks and feels great. Soft and clean and no more congested pore. I do use the First Aid acne pad 2xdaily, two moisturizers, yep 2 by Belif(Hungarian Water Essence and Pore Cleanser Moisturizer)!!  Plus an under eye cream, and a weekly peel.  So you can't just stop at cleanser sometimes. If youre not getting it right on your own, seek help. Everyone should feel flawless.

The glass bottle feels very luxurious and it is refillable, which I love for the environment. Overall I would say that this is a nice product and if clean beauty/sustainability are important to you then this is a great product, but if you are less concerned about those things then you could probably find a cheaper product that is very similar."

I prefer to have Ascorbic Acid in serums, and the kale and spinach likely just function as antioxidants, so I wonder why it isn't packaged in opaque glass. The natural fragrance which consists of fruit extracts can still potentially irritate the skin, though it didn't irritate mine as it doesn't maintain contact with the face for that long. It smells strongly of yuzu and leafy greens, and is actually quite pleasant. The foaming action is middle-of-the-road. I feel like it's not that harsh, but I definitely have more gentle foaming cleansers. There aren't many hydrating ingredients so the skin will feel clean and a bit squeaky after. I'm alright with this as I have oily skin but it might not be optimal for drier skin types. Overall, it's a pretty nice cleanser that I definitely enjoy, but the smell is pretty strong and the foam is a bit stripping for certain skin types."

The price isn't bad if you factor in how many oz it has. The brand has good intentions, a focus on good ingredients, & sustainable packaging. Although I like the glass packaging, I haven't found many uses for it. If someone could make a post on what they use the jars for, that would be great! I've seen talk of them creating a refill option for this which would be really cool. I will say though that due to the glass packaging & not so sturdy cap, I'm not keen on using this cleanser to travel. But back to the actual product itself: this isn't a magic cleanser or anything. I really don't get the hype & rave over this product. The only thing I really love about this is the smell. It's HEAVENLY. It smells like a fancy spa treatment & it enhances the experience of using this. The only reasons I could see someone loving this is if they have oilier skin or they just love the brand. Overall, not a massive fan of this product but it gets the job done. I actually stopped using this cleanser in favor of the Krave Beauty cleanser (unfortunately you can't get it at Sephora). It's a bit cheaper but it's a completely different experience. The KB cleanser feels soft, creamy, & so good on the skin. It feels really moisturizing & that's the focus of the KB cleanser. I think the YTTP cleanser's goal was to not be overly stripping but to still feel cleansing. The YTTP cleanser will probably work better for you if you have oilier skin but if you have drier skin, try the KB one. Should also note that if you are a frequent makeup user, I have seen many people recommend that you use this alongside an oil cleanser because this isn't good at removing makeup & sensitive skin beware: there are people who have been broken out by this! I don't think I'll be buying the full size but I enjoyed sampling this cleanser without having to take a leap by buying the full size."

It smells so clean and refreshing, it\u2019s so gentle, and it\u2019s great to use by itself or with a cleansing brush like a Clarisonic because it foams really easily.   It is definitely expensive, but the packaging is beautiful and to be honest it really lasts a long time. You don\u2019t need an entire pump each time you use it so my bottle is 3/4 full and I\u2019ve had it for at least 2 months now using it once per day (Used to be twice, but you know how quarantine goes). As far as the product itself goes, I do prefer the fresh soy face cleanser but it\u2019s very expensive and the tube doesn\u2019t last very long. I\u2019m sticking with this one because it\u2019s clean beauty, it does the job, it smells fantastic, and it lasts forever. Not to mention I do feel like my skin has improved in its elasticity since I began using it.   My only con is that because of the size of the bottle and the fact that it\u2019s glass, it\u2019s tough to pack in your bag even for a weekend trip. Other than that, it\u2019s a great product and I 100% recommend."

This face wash feels like it gives me a deep clean and does not strip my skin. It kind of just smells like regular hand soap( not super fragranced) and you get so much product for the price. I have seen that people have issues with the pump leaking. I personally have not had that problem thus far. So maybe it was just a bad batch that went out before."

It got to the point where I had decided my water\u2019s pH was the problem. That\u2019s how many failed face washes I tried. \u201cIt can\u2019t be all of these! It must be my water!\u201d Washing my face made my skin so irritated, I\u2019d even stopped doing it twice a day. I bought YTTP figuring I might as well support an ethical company, if nothing else.  After 1 week of using this, my skin is so happy. It\u2019s not red and irritated after washing. My oil level is unbelievably better. I honestly can\u2019t believe it. The first time since childhood that I\u2019ve been comfortable without foundation.  Big plus that the packaging uses minimal plastic, as well! I\u2019m super happy with my purchase. The price tag is a little hefty, but I\u2019m happy to pay it for something that\u2019s made such an incredible difference in my skin."

I really like this face wash because it is natural, in a glass pump bottle, doesn't leave my skin stripped or dry at all, and lathers really nice. Yes, it's pricey but you get quite a bit in the reusable bottle. I find it important to use quality, natural beauty products so this face wash is a win for me. I'd recommend trying out the small one to see if you like it, but I really enjoy it. I wash my face twice a day without fail, and a little goes a long way. It has lasted about 8 months and I probably have another month I can get out of it before needing to replace. I very rarely repurchase beauty products because I like to try new stuff but this is one I am seriously considering getting again."

I use the Clinique Take the Day Off Cleansing Balm to remove makeup before I go in with this, as the YTTP product is not quite strong enough to remove concealer, but it cleanses the skin perfectly and leaves it feeling soft and moisturized.

This does not foam up very much which was strange to me at first, but it does not have an effect on how well this cleanses my skin.  I start with my Green Clean makeup cleansing balm from Farmacy to remove my makeup and then I follow up with this cleanser. My oily T-zone feels balanced and I have noticed a reduction in oil production when I wake up in the morning. I am much less shiny and oily. The dry patches I have around my chin and between my eyebrows are not stripped of moisture and the breakouts I have experienced have been fewer and farther between since I started using this cleanser.  I would highly, highly recommend this cleanser. The Clean at Sephora approval and ingredient callouts are also a bonus!"

It is really good for people with dry and sensitive skin, but that doesn\u2019t mean it is not good for all skin types. I have oily, acne prone skin and this works for me. I will admit though you will not see dramatic changes in a day. Clean and simple ingredients are best for your skin, but only heavily processed and chemical filled products will show over night results.   This cleanser does live up to the \u201cclean\u201d name. I did see one ingredient that scared me which was \u201cnatural fragrance.\u201d  The word \u201cnatural\u201d has no legal definition in the food/skincare industry and fragrance is a known skin irritant so to find out more I emailed them and they reassured me that the \u201cfragrance\u201d comes from the foods found within the cleanser and are not chemical. I also dug through several YouTube videos to make sure this was correct and it is.   So if you are looking for a clean low chemical face cleanser I do recommend this. I believe in the long run of using this product it would benefit anyone\u2019s skin"

It has truly changed my skin for the better. I tend to be more oily in my T-zone and pretty normal-to-dry in my cheek area, so this cleanser is perfect for me. Using this, I have also noticed a significant improvement in my overall complexion. It seems brighter and healthier, which is a major plus. I also love YTTP and the morals that they stand for. Skincare for everyone, regardless of race, gender, skin type, sexual orientation, ethnicity, etc. This brand is a pioneer in the skincare industry, and I cannot wait to try more of their products!"

I was convinced that nothing on the market was actually going to heal my skin problems until I found this cleanser!!! This actually feels like it\u2019s cleaning deep within my pores, but I don\u2019t have to rush to put on moisturizer right after :) It foams nicely without having harmful sulfates. It\u2019s the best smelling face wash i\u2019ve ever used while being free of harmful fragrance and essential oils. Perfect for a gentle but effective double cleanse. Bonus it\u2019s fungal acne safe!! My skin has been clearer than ever and I don\u2019t need to use makeup anymore to cover my redness thanks to the green tea and vit c! My only ailment with this product was that the spout constantly leaked and I would lose a lot of product over time, but they have since replaced the spout and completely fixed that issue!

One of my favorite Youtubers gushes over this cleanser and I bought this along with their Vitamin C serum immediately after my irritating  cleansing fiasco.   After the first use, I immediately fell in love. It calmed my redness, evened out my skintone, made my skin super soft, and hydrated all of my dry areas.  I am on day 4 of using this in the AM and PM and my skin has been looking so much better. I have tried other cleansers before, but this one takes the trophy and my HEART. It is now my holy grail and I recommended this product to friends already!  YTTP cares about their brand and the values of their customers which is something I admire. Clean beauty is so important and their eco-friendly packaging gets an A+ from me. I am looking forward to trying their moisture cream next!"

I bought the full sized and used it for about two weeks. My skin started to have dry patches and would flake off. My skin became really dry when I usually have more oily skin in my t-zone. My t-zone started to become congested and I started to get little pimples and clogged pores. I love how this company is very eco-friendly and conscious about the environment, but this cleanser was too drying for me. I would recommend getting the smaller size before purchasing the whole thing."

This YTTP cleanser does not cause dryness and my skin is less oily after using it.  It also smell amazing and a clean product so why not.  Appreciate that it comes with a pump as the sample size(a glass jar opening) was hard to dispense.  I hope they will come up with refill pouches so I can reuse this glass jar."

Rinses off wonderfully and didn't sting near my sensitive eyes.  If you have allergies to botanical extracts, however, maybe stay away.

It makes my face feel super clean and refreshed without overly drying and I can't use anything else. a few weeks ago I ran out and had to use another cleanser while this one shipped and my skin was not even close to as good. This is so gentle but effective with awesome, soothing, superfood ingredients and I just love it. Also, the packaging is recycled and the glass bottle is recyclable (much better than plastic) also it's vegan and cruelty-free and the bottle lasts me (I use it once or twice a day depending on what my skin needs) about 3 months, so it lasts a long time for the price. JUST FYI this is not a makeup remover and I would use it as part of a double cleanse system with cleansing oil or balm if you wear makeup or sunscreen :)"

The next morning my skin was so unbelievably dry and cracked and bleeding in some areas. The temperature had also dropped about ten degrees so my already tortured skin was just crispy - it was awful.  In addition to finding medical grade strength moisturizer safe for acne prone skin (I used belif brand cream and gel layered together also bought from Sephora) I needed a gentle face wash that would still keep my acne prone skin clean during the peeling process. I chose this one and just prayed and thankfully it worked. It was so gentle on my compromised skin and was so effective that I still use it now as my regular face wash. I double wash with my medicated cleanser and this does such a good job I only follow with the medicated one twice a week. I will see in summer when my skin isn\u2019t so dry if this still goes the job (I have combo skin very reactive to the weather) but for dry winter chapped skin this is gentle and effective at getting skin clean."

I used it for about two weeks, and saw a noticeable decline in my skin's texture. Although I have somewhat blemished skin, the surface texture is generally smooth (so long as I stay hydrated.) This product seemed to cause a bumpy texture, so I was forced to discontinue my usage.   This cleanser is very lightweight, and lathers minimally. I found myself using a large amount of product, because I struggled to feel sufficiently cleansed when using a dime-sized drop. It is not over-drying, which is an aspect that I liked about it. I have had worse reactions to other cleansers, but this is unfortunately not a product that I will repurchase."

My skin rebounded and I forgot about it. When I ran out of my tried-and-true DE cleanser, I wanted to try something else. I love the way the super food cleanser smells and despite how many people complain about the packaging  I love it. The pump bottle is attractive and convenient and it comes with a screw top for travel. So despite my experience with the sample I gave it a go. My skin started looking worse within a couple times of using it :-/ I\u2019ve experienced face washes that don\u2019t necessarily improve anything but never one that made my skin worse.

It comes in a nice glass bottle and has an inoffensive smell of crushed greenery. That's about where the list of good qualities ends.  I bought this product as an upgrade from my drug-store brand face wash I've used without issue for over a decade. It has actively and noticeably made my skin worse in the full month that I've been using it. My face skin has tiny raised bumps that are new since starting use, and there's a noticeable increase in redness all over my face from before I started using it. I've removed other products from my regimen thinking it was them causing this, but after swapping things out over time I've realised this product is the culprit.   The product is runny and doesn't foam when rubbed in your hands or applied anywhere. I find I have to use far more of this face wash as other brands of face wash to get any kind of foam in my hands before it runs off  I am looking forward to switching back to my simple and affordable drug-store brand face wash and getting my unruddied and smooth skin back."

It lathers nicely, and it removes makeup very well, especially with a double cleanse to remove any face makeup.  The only reason I am taking off a star is that I find my face is a little tight, but again I do have dry skin. I combat this by using warm, not hot water, and it's not too bad.  Then  I follow this up with a moisturizer, and it's not a problem for me.  I strongly recommend getting at least the mini size to try it out and upgrading to the larger size if you find it works for you.  It's a little bit pricey for me, especially compared to other drugstore brands and face cleansers, but I have yet to find a drugstore brand that compares to this, so I am willing to pay the extra few dollars for my skin.

Now, I know that's my personal problem and not the reason for the 1 star. The reason for the 1 star is because this is a bad cleanser. I did get to try it a few times before I broke it, and every time it did not remove makeup or impurities well. I would follow with my toner and there was all kinds of stuff left behind that the cleanser did not get. It also left my skin feeling very tight and stripped.

I purchased the mini twice before biting the bullet on the bigger one and that formula seemed to be a thicker gel with a frothier foam.

This product would've gotten a 5 star from me BUT THE PACKAGING IS A MESS. I didn't understand why it was always so messy at the bottom of the bottle with a rim of product dried but I realized the pump leaks every so often and drips down the center of the bottle.

Pros: It is very gentle. I don't wash my face in the morning, but if you do, this is a nice gentle option that won't make your skin feel stripped and dry first thing in the morning. It has a light, non-perfumey fresh scent; this might sound weird, but it smells like a green smoothie. Either way, it's a nice scent that is not harsh at all.  Cons, and why I won't be buying the full size: It is very gentle. If I put makeup on, I double cleanse in the evening and I've found that this cleanser is not enough to completely get off any extra makeup or residue left from the cleansing balm. I have to triple cleanse in the evenings after washing off makeup, if I'm using this cleanser. For the price, I want this to be able to at least get leftover makeup off my face after already going in with a cleansing balm and this cannot do that.  Overall, it is a very nice gentle cleanser and I do like using it when I'm not washing off makeup. I just personally don't like having multiple cleansers when I know I can get one that does it all, and at a cheaper price point (I've used the La Roche Posay Toleriane foaming cleanser and the Simple Moisturizing Gentle cleanser and both are great options, get makeup off perfectly fine, and are at most groceries and drugstores)."

I do appreciate being able to recycle it, but it is not safe with children and elderly people on household.  More than one bottle been dropped or knocked over and broken in the shower or on sink.

I was a tad worried after buying because I had seen a few reviews saying this product ruined their skin but these reviews paled in comparison to the 5 star reviews saying this was a holy grail product. The first time I used the product within a week my skin broke out like nothing I had seen before, my cheeks were COVERED in little red spots of what looked like hyperpigmentation. At the same time I introduced this cleanser to my skin I started using a peeling mask and I assumed that was what was causing my issues. So I stopped both products and went back to my normal cleanser (First Aid Beauty) when I ran out of that and was unable to purchase a new bottle (corona) I started using the YTP cleanser again and within probably 2 days my skin broke out in Cystic Acne like I've never seen before. I've used less than half the bottle so I'll be returning it to Sephora asap. I'm extremely disappointed by this cleanser. Also side note it smells exactly like Dial hand soap (???? weird)"

At first, I thought this cleanser was bad and didn't help my skin at all, but I started rubbing more gently and washing my face with this cleanser for AT LEAST 2 minutes - I know that's long but just put on a video and time flies - and those two tips helped my skin so much. It also helps with hyperpigmentation and calms inflammation, redness, and most of my acne. For when I have fungal breakouts (like deep cystic acne) I would recommend using this, and then following up with a stronger treatment, as this cleanser essentially only calms skin. It has made the pores on my cheeks a little smaller as well, but that was with continued use, and isn't what the product claims to do."

Apparently, the fragrance component that se was talking about is the alfalfa extract which is not artificial or essential oil, so personally I don't see any problems with this product. I use this in the evening and Krave matcha in the morning, and honestly my skin feels even more hydrated than the Krave one. Will definitely purchasing the full size.

It was effective at removing dirt and unwanted oil from my skin without stripping it or leaving it feeling dry.   The scent was barely noticeable and not offensive at all.   However, I must share that the pump leaked quite badly and caused significant product waste.  This is not a cheap product which is fine.  I\u2019m happy to spend money on products I love that work well with my skin, but I do not like feeling like I\u2019ve washed my hard earned money down the drain and that\u2019s exactly what happened with this cleanser.  The pump leaked out product constantly no matter what I did to try to stop it.  I have no idea exactly how much was wasted, but I believe it was significant.

I use a very minuscule amount of this cleanser in the morning (less than a pea size) and then a little more at night. It's very convenient because you can leave it in the shower and wash your face. I love the simple packaging and most of all the clean ingredients. If you're on the fence whether or not to buy this, don't be...it's worth every penny!"

I have combination skin that leans on dry if I over do the facial masks (not hydrating ones) sometimes. Like clay masks (very drying on skin) more than twice a week. So I do want my cleansers and moisturizers to be very hydrating. I have also incorporated the Farmacy honeymoon serum into my skin care regimen about 3 weeks ago and have been using it 2-3 times a week, now twice with this cleanser. I was using a moisturizing cleanser with the Farmacy serum and now using this one in the past 2 weeks. The ingredients are ALL good for your skin!!!! Literally every single one!!! This is actually hard to find in a cleanser. Youth To the People has some really great products. When I first started using this cleanser my skin did feel a bit tight and I noticed some dry patches. I amped up using my hydrating masks during the first week and a heavier moisturizer at night and that seemed to be working so I continued to use those into the next week. I wanted to give it time because with any new product your skin needs to adjust. After two weeks I started to noticed the skin around my lips (that have been really dry and chapped during this winter) turn into scabs, which was very alarming. After I put my heavy moisturizer on it healed it up. This is chalk full of antioxidants which is great for your skin! I just think it is missing some moisturizing ingredients for balance. If this would contain hyaluronic acid or sodium hyaluronate it would be one of the best cleansers I have ever tried! I am going to continue to use it to see if my skin just needs to adjust more unless it makes it too dry."

It smells like a sweet green smoothie (more like green tea than kale or spinach), it lathers well, and you won\u2019t have to double cleanse to remove your makeup. Unless you\u2019re wearing very heavy eye makeup and full coverage foundation.  I have dry, sensitive skin and usually it turns red with the wrong product, but this cleanser didn\u2019t cause any redness! However, my skin still feels dry and I didn\u2019t notice any difference with my fine lines/wrinkles or texture.  This mini bottle has lasted me 1 month cleansing 1-2 times a day and I still have 1/4 of a bottle left, so it\u2019s definitely good value for money.

So I suppose if you\u2019re in a pinch it doubles as shampoo?  I highly recommend this product as a nice daily vegan gentle cleanser! Smells light and does the job.

It has been a bit of a struggle, since most face washes I was looking into either had some kind of ingredient that didn't agree with my skin or it had kaolin or another type so clay, which is obviously going to be drying. That's when I finally decided to spring for this wash and I will never look back. It cleanses so well, leaves my skin feeling fresh and never dry or squeaky clean (which is not good either.) My skin has been clearing up and I no longer have that horrible dry skin tightening feeling. I highly recommend! And even though the price may seem like a lot, a mid-range drug store cleaner would typically cost $12 for 4 oz, so for 8 oz this is a pretty fair deal!"

I gave the rest to my boyfriend who uses it to wash off his zinc based sunscreen, and although it gets every last bit off it's just too drying for my everyday cleansing needs.

I recently purchased an AHA and BHA peel and was using it along side this when I randomly got an acid/chemical burn on my chin. (I\u2019ve had the burn before it just gets itchy and patchy, be careful when using acids) I assumed it was just maybe too high of a percent for my skin or I forgot to wear sunscreen which will cause a reaction. After the burn was gone I tried to use my peel again and noticed no burn or irritation it was actually helping which I knew it would I\u2019ve used them before and then yesterday I used this cleanser on its own just to try it out without mixing it with the acid and it totally burnt my skin idk what\u2019s in this that my skin hates but clearly this is not the product for me so be sure to do some research on the product or keep your receipt to return it if it doesn\u2019t work for you. I also found this super strange as it is marketed as being gentle I really haven\u2019t had this happen to me before from a cleanser acids I understand but a gentle everyday cleanser I would assume wouldn\u2019t burn my skin."

I'm only giving it 4 stars because I can see how it is a little stripping at time. I have oily skin so it usually does not leave my skin feeling stripped, but on some of those super dry winter days it can. I don't see that being an issue at all in the summer months, but if you have dry skin I'd definitely recommend getting a small bottle to try first and using it once a day to start.

It has a light grassy smell and goes away soon after you lather it into your skin. It did not irritate my sensitive combo skin nor did it break me out, which is a plus.   Cons: the packaging is awful. Like several of the previous reviews, the product constantly leaks and it's such a waste of product, especially if it costs $36 per bottle (and I really dislike wasting product). I would give it 4 stars if it wasn't for the defective packaging. With so many other options of cleansers that are available, I would most likely not be purchasing this product again. I also didn't really see a significant change in my skin after using this for the past few weeks."

It does have a green scent but it's not overwhelming but rather mild and pleasant.   Thirdly, I'd just like to say that it's worth mentioning that when you buy the cleanser, one does have to assemble the pump oneself. For those having issues, maybe they didn't do it right? Idk, I'm on my second bottle and I've had ZERO issues. Also, the bottles are so cool and they are totally reusable. Love, love, LOVE this brand.

Usually every other cleanser can fully take my makeup off. This makes me wonder how well it actually cleanses your face or takes off your makeup. But overall it\u2019s a pretty good product!

My skin usually never ever has breakouts, so I\u2019m very disappointed to say the least. I have these teeny tiny bumps all over my face. On the contrary, I will say that this product DOES remove makeup very well. That is why I gave it three stars. I\u2019ve been trying it for about a month now and I\u2019m finally calling it quits."

First and most importantly its free of sodium laureth sulfate and other harsh surfactants which are irritating over time, also no essential oils or artificial fragrance. Second its in a glass bottle so it can be recycled an infinite amount of times and the pump locks for travel so you don't lose any product. finally youth to the people does a lot of great things as a brand and while I don't like the 36$ price tag I feel its justified because im sure its not cheap to be ethical nowadays. Overall I've been using this for about a week after receiving a sample and it does great to not strip my dry winter skin. I use it after a micellar double cleanse at night if I wear makeup or on its own in the morning or if i'm barefaced."

It took my skin about 2  weeks to adjust to this cleanser, I was using a CeraVe cleanser beforehand. Initially, it dried my skin out so much that I had to use twice my normal amount of moisturizer and serums. I was tempted to stop using it immediately but decided to see how it would play out over time. Once my skin adjusted to the cleanser I've noticed my pores generally look smaller, my skin texture is smoother, and my skin is far less oily. If you're looking for a cleanser for sensitive   oily skin that reduces oil and improves texture, I would highly recommend the YTTP cleanser with a regime of good moisturizers and know that your skin might take time to adjust to the product!"
