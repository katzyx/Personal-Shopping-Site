It's very easy to use and I like that it doesn't only have to be used internally. The spot vibrator also stimulates reallyyyy well on the outside as well. Let's just say it hits the spot.

I got this beauty in the Green color and love the look of it, but most importantly, I love the amazing things it does :) the curved angle gets to the right spot, every time.   In true Ivy Smoak, Single Girl Rules fashion, anything above 8 inches must not be refused and at a whopping 8 1/2 inches, this bad boy cannot be refused.  It's the perfect size, has the perfect curve and just the right amount of speeds. You can go from a gentle vibration to a full on rough sesh. I love it for both internal and external use.

The massage comes in a very discreet packaging and at the first sight you won't notice that it is a personal massager at all. The massager also comes with a usb charger, a sample of a personal lubricant and a discreet neutral storage bag for the personal massager. The massager is very smooth and soft to the touch. There is the smell of the silicone which is important because I have experienced when a massager has a plasticy odor. The thickness of the massager is just perfect for me which is compared to other massagers that I have tried. The vibrating feature is better to use externally for me rather than internally. "

The vibration is very powerful so sometimes level 1 is all that I needed and maybe level 2 in the last minute! If I hold it too long my fingers would go numb haha that's how strong it is! The long lasting battery life is definitely a bonus. I personally love the forest green color which is unusual and very chic for a sexy time toy."

This can be used alone or with your partner and both outcomes will be explosive. The variation of vibrations are great for beginners all the way up to those who are more seasoned when it comes to vibrations and their tolerance level. I can definitely feel the vibrations and theyu2019re incredibleu2014 each level! I highly recommend this.

I love the feel of the soft material against my sensitive skin with itu2019s super soft 100% platinum grade silicone it feels lovely and with lube glides beautifully in and out and cleans super easily as well. Now the 5 speeds are great because they can start you off slow and continue to go up in good speed to very high speed for an instant orgasim. Iu2019ve experimented with the different speeds and have to say itu2019s enjoyable at all speeds and very pleasurable. Its easy to build up the pleasure with the speeds or if you are on time constraints can adjust or however you enjoy yourself this vibrator has the speed!

It is very good quality made and you can wash it and I believe use it with lubricant too if you need to. It has five speed settings for your liking. It shaped in the way so it can stimulate the G spot but you can use it tip up or down for your liking. It gives such an ultimate long lasting pleasure. Highly recommend this internal device. You can probably use it fine to stimulate clitor too. I think itu2019s great value for the money."
