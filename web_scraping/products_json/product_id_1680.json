Additionally, it adds volume and fullness, which helps me style my hair effortlessly to meet my everyday needs.I live that I can use this anytime with wet or dry hair because I like it enough that its very cinvinient for me.  Overall, I really like this product and will definitely continue using it!"

I apply it to areas with less density, and now those spots have baby hairs growing in and look much fuller. The serum doesn't leave my hair greasy or sticky, and there's no residue. The dropper is super convenient, and I love the sleek, subtle packaging. Overall, my hair feels healthier, shinier, and softer, without any coarseness or brittleness. I really appreciate how manageable and full my hair looks and feels now."

The packaging itself felt cheapu2014the pink and gold design seemed more suited for a bargain beauty product than something positioned as high-end.  As for the formula, alcohol is noticeably present and appears to be a main ingredient. This is a huge red flag for me, as I intentionally avoid alcohol in both skincare and hair care due to its drying effects. Additionally, the heavy fragrance was overwhelming and unnecessary for a product intended for scalp care.  Unfortunately, this product failed in both presentation and formulation. I cannot recommend it to anyone looking for effective and thoughtful hair care solutions. No and no."

I did feel like the bottle was very small-only 30ml, which is very small compared to other hair growth serums I have tried. The serum had a very tolerable smell. And when I applied it on my hair, it was very light weight and absorbed very quickly. It did not leave my scalp feeling greasy or heavy.   I havent used this product long enough to notice hair growth, but its interesting (with how expensive it is) that you have to commit to 2-3 months of using it to determine whether or not you had positive results from it. It was definitely a costly serum"

I applied this daily, and I wash my hair about 4 times a week and that was still the same. I would apply to the scalp and then spend 5 minutes using my scalp massager before styling my hair.

I like that it feels weightless on the scalp and doesnt make my hair feel u201cdirtyu201d. I usually apply it before bed. My hair is very fine and thin and always has been, but it is definitely getting thinner as I approach menopause. Obviously, I did not expect the serum to change my hair type. Like, I did not expect I am suddenly going to have a thick, luscious head of hair lol. My hope though was that I would see noticeable differences in growth. After three months, I have noticed a lot of baby hair growth. It is encouraging. My stylist noticed it as well when I went in a few weeks ago. Im not sure that Ive noticed any huge differences in shedding, though. So did I see results? Yes, I think so. Like I said, a lot of new growth. Did it change my life in 3 months? No. Will I continue using it? Yes, because I still have another bottle. After that, Im not sure. Obviously this is a product that you need to really take your time with, and I am wondering if six months would give me a better idea of what this product might do for me. On the other hand, Im not sure if the difference is big enough for me to keep making the investment. I will use up the rest of my stash and then I will decide. Do I recommend this? Yes, because I did see some results. However, keep in mind that this is not a miracle treatmentu2026 at least in my experience."

I was applying it after washing my hair or before going to bed. One full dropper is all you need. I would focus on the spot areas I wanted to see more growth. After one month I started to see more baby hair in those areas. My hair also looks healthier and stronger. The texture is nice, it's easy to apply and it doesn't have a scent, which is a bonus for me and it doesn't fight with your shampoo or leave-in products. The packaging is pretty and it's vegan and cruelty-free!! I will keep using it."

This serum is designed to help those dealing with thinning hair by promoting healthier, fuller-looking strands. One of the things I appreciate about the GRO Hair Serum is its lightweight formula. It doesnt leave my hair feeling greasy or weighed down, which is a common issue with many hair serums. Instead, it absorbs quickly and feels like its nourishing my scalp from within. After a few weeks of consistent use, Ive noticed that my hair feels stronger and looks healthier. While its too soon to see significant regrowth, I can definitely tell that my hair is less prone to breakage, and theres an overall improvement in its thickness and volume. Another great aspect of this serum is that its made with plant-based ingredients, which makes me feel good about what Im putting on my scalp. It also has a pleasant, subtle scent that doesnt overpower, which I appreciate. Overall, the GRO Hair Serum for Thinning Hair has been a positive addition to my hair care routine. Its a great option for anyone looking to improve the appearance and health of their thinning hair."

The serum itself is very nice - it has almost no scent, applies easily, and is very lightweight. My hair texture is very fine so my hair tends to look greasy and clumpy quite easily and this serum didnt cause any of those issues, which is a big plus for me. This is definitely not the type of product where you are going to see immediate results, so I would only recommend it if youre willing to stick with it for a while. After 3 months Im just now starting to see a visible difference with my hairline and as far as fallout, though I think my hair and scalp have felt healthier for a while longer than that. Overall, Im really happy with it. I plan to continue using it to see where the improvements can take me and would definitely recommend giving this serum a try if youre willing to exercise a bit of patience."

My existing hair didnt grow faster nor did I get new growth from this. Im a fine haired person with extra shedding but no medical conditions as far as scalp or balding goes, so I assumed it would work for me.

Its formula, enriched with natural ingredients, has not only boosted my hair's volume but also enhanced its overall health and shine. For anyone struggling with thinning hair, the GRO Hair Serum is a game-changer that truly delivers on its promises."

After I finished my first bottle I left the second one out where I can see it everyday, that way I wouldnt forget to use it. I love the it doesnt make my hair greasy.

I decided to give this serum a try, and I'm so glad I did. I love the fact that it has a water based formula that made it easy to use the serum every day without having a build up.  Also, it doesn't leave your hair feeling greasy or dirty after application cause it dries quickly. At first, I was a bit hesitant because it gave a slight tingling sensation when I used it the first time, but I quickly got used to it casue it went away within a minute. Within the first couple of weeks, I noticed less hair fall. By the end of the first month, my hair stopped falling out altogether, which was a huge relief. During the second month, I started seeing baby hairs growing, and the best part was that they were growing in the temple area, where I needed it most. Now that I've finished my third bottle, I can confidently say that this product really works. Also, I made sure to eat a healthy diet, which I think helped enhance the results. Overall, I highly recommend the GRO Hair Serum if you're struggling with hair loss. Fixing the hair loss at the temple area definitly gave me more confidence so if you have a similar issue I'd recommend to start taking actions towards it and start using this product."

I've been using the Vegamour GRO Hair Serum for about 90 days now, and the difference in my hair's health and appearance is remarkable. **Packaging and Application:** The packaging is sleek and user-friendly, with a dropper that makes application easy and precise. The serum itself is lightweight and non-greasy, which is a huge plus for someone with an oily scalp. **Ingredients and Scent:** Vegamour prides itself on using clean, plant-based ingredients, which was a major selling point for me. The serum contains powerful botanicals like mung bean, red clover, and curcumin, all known for their hair-strengthening properties. The scent is subtle and pleasant, not overpowering like some other hair products. **Results:** After consistent use, I noticed a significant reduction in hair shedding and an increase in hair density. My hair feels thicker, stronger, and overall healthier. Its not an overnight miracle, but with patience and regular application, the results are definitely worth it. **Value for Money:** While Vegamour products are on the pricier side, I believe the investment is justified given the quality and effectiveness. They also offer subscription options which provide some savings and convenience. **Overall:** I highly recommend Vegamour to anyone looking for a natural and effective solution for improving their hair health. The combination of high-quality ingredients, ease of use, and noticeable results makes it a standout in the crowded hair care market."

So Im happy with that. Now I did notice that I had to wash my hair more often while using this or else my scalp would get itchy but  it wasnt to bad I switch to a weekly and appears to bi weekly wash routine while using. For me personally I dont think I could use it if I had a protective style I was intending to keep in for two months plus.

This is the only product Ive added to my routine. Im experiencing a ton of breakage about 1-2 inches from my scalp - which is where the product will migrate toward when massaging into scalp.  Perhaps its just me, but blondes, be cautious and pay attention.   I only use a straightener 1-2 times per week on a low heat setting so its not from heat damage.  Im starting to look like a science centre experiment where the static makes the broken hair stand up in all directions (and constantly hav to use oils to flatten in down).

I probably would have stopped using it after 3 months if I saw more negative reviews on the product. I was told by customer service to continue using it to see results.If you are young without any issues, it may work. I think many people believe it works because of the serum, but I think it's really about messaging the scalp. This is not FDA approved, so there is no scientific evidence that this product really works. I think they have great marketing and only show positive reviews. This is a really expensive product to use on a regular basis, so think twice before purchase."

I will definitely continue using the GRO Serum to continue to see more results. I am excited to see the improvement over the course of a full year! If you have thinning hair, or even no thinning but dry, brittle hair, I highly suggest trying this product! Just be aware that it does take time to see regrowth, and as with all hair related issues I recommend giving a good three months of use before doing a comparison!

I never had any reactions or tingly feelings. It is very simple and clear to you. It doesnt smell funny. It doesnt necessarily make your hair look greasy but I did notice that my hair wouldnt make it as long to the next wash day as it typically would, without using the hair oil. I could usually get away with washing my hair once a week, but while using this oil, I had to about every 3 to 4 days. But a small compromise to get some decent hair growth. The aesthetic of the bottle is very pleasing and nice to leave out on your counters so youre not forgetting to apply it daily. This is constant three month use."

While still fine, my strands seem somewhat fuller. The serum is very easy to use. I applied one dropper full in certain areas (sides and middle part) and gently massaged my scalp. The serum looks and feels like water and did not cause any irritation to my scalp. It did make my hair feel slightly greasy where applied but this would disappear by morning. As there is no irritation from this serum, I am going to continue using this to see if there is an even bigger difference in my strands.  Slow and steady wind the race."

As someone with thick hair , that struggles with hair loss at my temples from wearing a ponytail , finding an effective and clean solution has been amazing.  The serum is easy to incorporate into my daily routine. Following the suggested usage, I fill the dropper and apply it directly to my scalp. The fast-absorbing, non-greasy formula makes it suitable for both wet and dry hair, and there's no need to rinse, which is convenient.  The key benefits listed u2013 increased hair density, reduced shedding, and stronger, more resilient strands u2013 have proven true in my experience. I noticed a visible improvement in the thickness of my hair within the promised 90 days. The combination of turmeric, caffeine, and the red clover and mung bean blend seems to create a potent formula that not only stimulates the scalp but also nourishes and promotes healthier-looking hair.  One aspect I appreciate is the delightful fragrance. The light, citrusy scent with floral undertones adds a pleasant touch to the application process without being overpowering. Plus the texture is more like water so it doesnt affect me from styling it .  What sets Vegamour GRO Hair Serum apart is its commitment to clean, vegan ingredients. Knowing that it's plant-based and free from harmful additives adds to the appeal. Considering the staggering statistic that 80 million Americans suffer from hair loss, with 40% being women, this product's holistic approach to hair wellness is commendable.  Vegamour GRO Hair Serum is a reliable solution for those dealing with thinning hair, offering visible results and a refreshing approach to promoting sustainable hair health."

Why would a hair serum that requires 3 months of use be sold in a bottle with 1 months (or less) supply? Its absolutely ludicrous for the price. I guess Im the fool for buying it. I just didnt think about the commitment to the price. Not only do you need at least three months to notice any growth, you need to continue to use it to maintain those results. Super expensive in the long run and there are better alternatives. I used it for a month and of course I dont see a difference because you are not meant to until month 3. So this is a true review for what you are purchasing, a one month supply of vegamour growth serum. It doesnt work."

The product is supposed to last for one month, which would make it seem on the costlier side, however I have managed to get just under two months of usage out of my bottle, which is not too bad. Instructions say to use one pipette. I find when I squeeze the bulb of the pipette, it fills up to just over the halfway mark. And for me, that's more than enough for one application. So what have I noticed so far? Honestly not much. My hair has been more lank since I started using this, and I'm almost at the end of my bottle. I'm also finding I need to wash it more often.

Cut my hair to one layer, changed my showerhead to the Jolie showerhead and started using this serum EVERYDAY. Morning and Night. Naturally resting hair falls out 150 pieces in a sitting. However when you wash your hair 1 time a week it's more like 500+ Lol! I've cut my hair in late November and I've been using this serum for a month and have already seen 1-1/2 inch of growth. Usually i would be the customer to write a crappy review if the product was indeed crap. But this product Works. What i like the most of this product is that its like water so it DOES NOT leave your hair greasy or weighed down AT ALL. If your struggling with thin hair, hair loss Run do not walk.

When I saw this treatment, I was really excited. First of all, you can use it on wet OR dry hair. I don't wash my hair every time I shower but I was still able to use this every single day! It's also super quick and simple to apply with the dropper. So even when I was running around in the morning or super tired at night, I never skipped this step in my routine since it's just so easy! Now for the results... this made my hair grow but also made it SUPER healthy and shiny looking again! I couldn't believe the difference it made in just 3 months. That being said, if you're going to do this, I think it's really important to know you need to commit to applying it every single day! It's similar in that way to eyelash or brow growth serums.

After using it for over two months, I am absolutely in love with the results I have achieved.  First and foremost, I have noticed a significant improvement in the length and thickness of my hair. It feels fuller and more voluminous, which has boosted my confidence tremendously. The serum has effectively addressed my concerns about thinning hair, and I couldnt be happier with the outcome.  What sets this serum apart from others is its ability to fill in my bald areas and make them look fuller. This has been a game-changer for me, as it has helped me regain a sense of self-assurance. Its amazing to see how this serum has transformed my hair, making it appear more luscious and healthy.  Another aspect that I truly appreciate about this serum is its lightweight formula. I can use it every day without worrying about it making my hair oily or weighing it down. This has been a pleasant surprise, as Ive had issues with other products in the past. Additionally, I havent experienced any irritation on my scalp, which is a huge relief.  To top it all off, my hair has also grown in length since I started using this serum. This is an added bonus that I didnt expect, but I am absolutely loving it. The serum has undoubtedly contributed to the overall health and growth of my hair, and I couldnt be more grateful.  The Gro hair serum for thinning hair has exceeded my expectations in every way. It has made my hair longer, thicker, and has filled in my bald areas, all while being gentle and non-irritating. I highly recommend this serum to anyone struggling with thinning hair, as it has truly been a game-changer for me. @fabbeautyboss"

I really hoped that this was going to work but honestly I'd recommend saving your money or using it on something else."

I am very anemic right now also aging- I am 45 so the patch I wanted to work on is really thinning. I was very dedicated with applying the serum. I always had an issue of the best way I should be applying it. The area I wanted to treat was at my temples and it never felt like it was sinking in or getting to the right area so I was always worried I was applying it wrong. It does make your hair a little oily so you have to choose the right time to use it. I wrote them to ask if the stronger formula might be better for me but I never heard back so I just continued with this. The truth is that I believe I have seen some small Growth in these 3 months. And doing something is better than doing nothing. I am not going to say this doesnt work because I have other factors like health reasons that may make it harder so keep that in mind when purchasing. However if you are just someone experiencing mild thinning and going through a hard time I would give it a shot."

The dropper is mostly easy to use though I found one squeeze only filled it about halfway and was unsure of this constituted a full dropper or just a half. The formula doesn't leave greasiness and did a good job of absorbing. I did notice that with regular use I tended to use my dry shampoo more frequently for oiliness but the serum also helped limit the dry shampoo buildup and helped my hair look more voluminous and fresh on my no-wash days. Over the past few months of use I also noticed general improvements with my hair looking more thick and less wispy as well as more resilient and less prone to fall out."

I diligently applied the GRO Hair Serum to his scalp daily and massaged it in. He got frustrated because it took well into the second bottle to start seeing any results. I wouldnt say the serum completely made a difference, but it definitely made and improvement. u2728  He had no issues with irritation or any weird side effects. At the end of the three months my husbands bald spot was definitely fuller but not completely. He was pleased with the outcome. The only thing we werent fond of is that now that we have ran out of the three month supply, his hair is starting to thin out again. So we feel its a product that doesnt give long lasting results without continual usage. u2728"

After years of bleaching my hair, constantly straightening it, and age, Ive noticed my hair thinning around my middle part. It got worse during the pandemic due to stress. So far Ive noticed my middle part is not as thin as it used to be and even my hairline looks fuller. Ill definitely be using this long term for better long lasting effective results."

I've noticed a significant reduction in hair shedding and my hair feels stronger and healthier. The natural ingredients like red clover and mung bean have definitely contributed to the visible improvement in my hair's thickness. The serum has a pleasant, subtle scent that doesn't overpower. It's become an essential part of my hair care routine, and I'm excited to see continued results. If you're struggling with thinning hair, I highly recommend giving this serum a try"

I have my dads hairline (lol) so I think my thinning is just genetic. I also know I could have a better diet, so I dont want to blame my poor hairline health solely on the serum knowing I could probably do something else to help. One thing I do love about it is its totally non-greasy. I used it at night with a gua sha comb for extra massage and my hair looked clean and totally fine the next day!

The serum is easy to apply with its light, non-greasy texture. It didn't leave any residue or weigh down my hair, so I used it day and night without problems. The dropper packaging made it easy to apply precisely. After a few weeks, I noticed my hair was stronger, thicker, and longer. I also had fewer hair breakages. Keep in mind that results can vary based on genetics and health. Vegamour Hair Growth Serum is eco-friendly and affordable compared to similar products. In short, it worked better than I expected."

Because the serum is simple to use, it may be applied precisely and wastelessly.  It feels good to gently massage the serum into the scalp after it has been administered.

I did a lot of research on what growth serum I wanted to try and I was excited to try Vegamour. After a month of regular use, I noticed much less shedding when brushing and showering. After three months of consistent use, I also noticed that the areas where my baby hair was very sparse are really coming in. The product is super easy to use, and I especially love that I can use it on wet or dry hair since I don't wash my hair every day. It dried fully and quickly and didn't leave an oily residue. I would usually apply before bed, but I just took a little dropper, spread it across my scalp, and focused on areas that were thinner. There's no smell, color, or really any indication I've put anything in my hair after a few minutes, which is ideal.  I'll definitely keep using this and hope the shedding continues to decrease! A little goes a long way, especially if you have finer hair."

This product addresses an issue that affects so many people, and I'm delighted to share my experience. First and foremost, the statistics about hair loss are eye-opening, and it's reassuring to know that there's a holistic solution available. The 360u00ba approach to Hair Wellness makes complete sense, considering the various factors that can contribute to hair thinning. What sets GRO Hair Serum apart is its plant-based, vegan, and clinically-tested formula. I appreciate that it not only supports a healthy and balanced follicular ecosystem but also soothes the scalp and revitalizes hair roots. It's clear that this serum was designed with a deep understanding of hair health. The exclusive 90-day campaign is a brilliant concept. Having three bottles to use consistently for three months allowed me to thoroughly evaluate its effectiveness. And let me tell you, the results are impressive! I started noticing visible improvements similar to the before and after photos provided. My hair felt stronger, and I noticed less hair fall. My scalp felt healthier, and my hair had a renewed vitality to it. It's important to emphasize that results may vary from person to person, but the fact that I experienced such positive changes in just three months speaks volumes about the product's efficacy. If you're dealing with hair thinning or loss, I highly recommend giving the GRO Hair Serum a try. It's a holistic approach that works, and I'm grateful for the opportunity to participate in this campaign and share my positive experience with this transformative product."

It did not feel oily which I was super happy about and I did see progress in growth which i am super happy about. I usually would put it in the afternoons after showering and before styling my hair.

After using the GRO serum for 30days-Ive seen a visible difference and Im so stoked. My hair is growing in at a steady pace, Im able to wear my natural hair out without being embarrassed about my balding hairline- I now actually have edges. The most important thing that drew me to vegamour was that their product is vegan, its naturally scented-smells like a natural oil but doesnt leave you with buildup on your scalp like an oil would. Its soothing to your scalp and helps revitalize your hair. Im obsessed and I 100% recommend! I cant wait to see what my hair will look like in 3months.  Gifted by Vegamour"

Grow Hair Serum is a plant-based, multi-tasking product that promotes healthier-looking hair by reducing signs of shedding and promoting thicker, fuller hair. It is clinically proven and highly effective, using a combination of vegan phytoactives to support a healthy follicular ecosystem. The water-based formula quickly penetrates hair follicles, ensuring no excess oil on the scalp. GRO is 100% vegan, gluten-free, cruelty-free, and certified clean at Sephora. It is easy to use, requiring only one dropper per day, and can be applied morning or night for best results.  I have been struggling for a long time with hair loss, and no treatment has come close to this result. I accepted the fact that my edges were not coming back. However, the more I used the product, the more I started noticing little changes, and I am loving it. It has been a little over 3 months since I started using products. I am very happy with my results.  This is how to use:  Fill one dropper full and evenly disperse droplets throughout a wet or dry scalp. Gently massage the product into the scalp with your fingertips. Leave in. Style your hair as usual. Can be applied morning or night. Apply daily for 90 days for the best results."

As someone who has struggled with hair thinning and slow growth, finding a product that delivers on its promises is a game-changer. One of the standout features of Vegamour Hair Growth Serum is its commitment to using natural ingredients. It's formulated with a blend of plant-based actives, such as mung bean, red clover, and curcumin, which work together to nourish the hair follicles and promote healthy growth. This was particularly appealing to me, as I prefer to use products that are free from harsh chemicals and synthetic additives. The serum itself has a lightweight and non-greasy texture, making it easy to apply and work into the scalp. I appreciated that it didn't leave any residue or weigh my hair down, allowing me to use it both day and night without any inconvenience. The convenient dropper packaging also ensures precise application, preventing product wastage. Over the course of several weeks, I noticed a significant improvement in my hair's overall health and appearance. My hair felt stronger, looked thicker, and even had a noticeable increase in length. Additionally, I experienced fewer hair breakages and shedding, which was a pleasant surprise. It's important to note that individual results may vary, as hair growth can be influenced by various factors, including genetics and overall health. Another aspect that sets Vegamour Hair Growth Serum apart is its commitment to sustainability. The brand is dedicated to using eco-friendly and cruelty-free practices, which is a big plus for conscious consumers like myself. In terms of affordability, Vegamour Hair Growth Serum is relatively competitively priced compared to other similar products on the market. Considering the quality of ingredients and the noticeable results it delivers, I believe it offers good value for the price. Overall, Vegamour Hair Growth Serum exceeded my expectations."

The product was really easy to use and felt amazing on my scalp when massaging it in! I used the product at night or in the morning when i wanted to wear my hair in slick back buns! I also used it after showing as well and it didn't leave any oil residue or anything i could style my hair as usual so you can use it on wet or dry hair. Overall this product really helped my hair and I will repurchase this product for even more results! Gifted by Vegamour."

Not gonna lie, I didn't have much hope when I first started using this. I just kind of accepted that the baby hairs were there to stay. Thankfully, that's not the case. After using this gro serum for the past several months, I've FINALLY started to see progress. It's not anything crazy, but my hair is slowly growing back, and I couldn't be happier. So, about the ceram itself. It's extremely easy to use, simply apply using the dropper and massage in with your fingertips, and a dropper actually goes a lot farther than I thought it would. I don't know if it was just me, but it actually had a slightly cooling effect? I've used this on both wet and dry hair, both morning and night, and love that there is no greasiness or oily residue left behind. I did not notice any buildup after using this consistently for several months. I'm extremely impressed with my results considering nothing else had seem to have helped until now.

I started at my scalp and would sprinkle droplets through out my hair, then I would massage the serum with my fingers. With continued use, I did not feel like the serum weighed my hair down and did not make my scalp greasy/oily at all. There was barely a fragrance which I prefer. I applied it both to wet and dry hair to see if there was a difference, and personally I feel like it worked better for me on wet hair.

This serum has definitely yielded results although I will note that it is a slow process and one that takes time. I prefer using the serum at night as I find that using a whole dropper per application can weigh my hair down if applied during the daytime. The product itself is easy to use and feels nice on the scalp, I like to massage it in for a couple minutes, ensuring its well distributed. Ive noticed tons of new baby hairs along my hairline, which I take as a great sign. Ive also noticed less shedding in the shower. I look forward to seeing improved results as I continue using daily. This product was complimentary from Vegamour."

As someone who's been dealing with hair thinning and shedding, I was intrigued by their holistic approach to hair wellness. The statistics they shared about hair loss affecting so many Americans, especially women, hit close to home. What caught my attention the most was their plant-based, clinically-tested formula. It's not just about tackling one issue, but a combination of factors like stress, vitamin deficiencies, and scalp health. The water-based serum feels light and quickly absorbs into the scalp, leaving no greasy residue. I love that I can use it daily without worrying about excess oil. While it's still early days, I've noticed my hair feeling stronger and looking healthier. The serum has a soothing effect on my scalp, which is a huge relief. The promise of visible results in 90 days seems realistic, and I'm excited to continue this journey. Overall, Vegamour Gro Hair Serum offers a comprehensive solution for hair health. It's suitable for various hair types and textures, and the 30-day supply per bottle makes it convenient to incorporate into my routine. If you're looking to address hair loss, thinning, and shedding, I'd definitely recommend giving this serum a try."

I cannot say whether the results are permanent, but it is real hair thats growing there and I dont think its just going to start falling out if I stop using this product. That said, I dont know if it actually addresses the underlying causes of hair loss, so if you stop using it, and those are not addressed, your results may not be permanent.

And the best part is that my scalp never felt itchy or irritated while using it. While it takes about 90 days to see major changes, I've already noticed some exciting results. My hair length hasn't changed much, but I see new hair growth. The shorter broken hairs on top of my head (probably from hair dye) have grown about two inches since I started using the serum. My hair also looks fuller near the base. Overall, I'm really happy with this product. I can't wait to see even more results after the full 90 days!"

I mainly focused a lot more on certain areas where I had less hair but still added the access to the rest of my hair. I saw more baby hairs growing in.

It's so easy to use, you just use one dropper-full and massage it into your scalp. Every night before bed I apply it, and it never makes my hair greasy or acquire build-up like some products do. Over the next few months, I have noticed a significant difference in my hair thickness/volume that I previously struggled with. I did not use any other supplements or special products, just the Vegamour serum and reduced heat styling. I will continue using this serum because it's truly made a difference in my hair thickness!"

I used it at night before i went to bed either on wet or dry hair. It never created build up and I could style my hair per usual the following day. It is not oily at all! Overall, I am super impressed with the results so far and will continue to use!  I was gifted by Vegamour."

If you follow me on my socials (@angiesmayhem) you can see how long my hair is. I really want to keep it healthy and full, and the fullness has been tough. After giving birth to my first baby, I noticed thinning and noticed certain areas not as full, like little naked areas. I started to apply Vegamour every night before bed. I applied it all over my scalp, separating my hair vertically with one filled dropper, and would just focus a bit more on my sparse naked sides a little more (that got extra love.) When I say my jaw dropped, Im saying that literally! Just look at the difference. I have new hairs that are like bang lengths right now. What in sorcery is this?! lol! If this is the results now,  I most definitely look forward to seeing the results at its fullest potential. My recommendation. Give it a try for at least 30 days. Find the balance for you and your hair, and stay consistent."

With just one dropper full, you can cover your entire scalp or use it as a spot treatment. The serum is easy to dispense, allowing for precise application without any wastage.  Once applied, massaging the serum into the scalp with your fingertips is a pleasant experience. The lightweight formula feels refreshing and soothing on the scalp, providing a relaxing sensation during application. It absorbs quickly without leaving any greasy residue, making it suitable for all hair types.  One standout feature of the Vegamour GRO Hair Serum is its water-based formula. Unlike some other hair serums, this one doesn't build up on the scalp over time. This means you can use it regularly without worrying about product buildup or weighing down your hair."

This may be lengthy, but stick it out for me - I am 32 and have recently gone through some truly traumatic life events.

My hair has been such a large part of my identity for so long and I was willing to try anything. Dedicating three months of my life to anything is a challenge but I knew that if the end result was better looking hair that I may be able to stick it out. I applied this to the bald patches on my head every morning. I used a scalp massager to work the serum in to my roots and waited till it dried (which it never made my hair look greasy) and then would style as usual. I did this every single day for 90 days. I am in tears writing this because the results were and are truly worth the wait. I have the confidence again to wear my hair back in braids or in a bun. I am not constantly wearing a hat to hide hair I dont have. And I want to make sure to say that this did not magically give me longer thicker hair - so dont go in to this thinking that. But it did start new growth in areas where I had lost my hair. I was lucky to be gifted by vegamour but this product will be used continuously in my hair routine. This is worth every penny.

My hair lacks volume, and when I would use this, it would make my hair even flatter. I also felt that it made my hair look greasy. I like my hair to look freshly showered, and each time I used this on my freshly showered hair, it didn't have that post hair wash day look. I was disappointed, and ended up washing my hair every day, which isn't very healthy for my hair. I was gifted by vegamour in exchange for my honest review."

As someone who is currently struggling with hair thinning due to weight loss, I was in need of a reliable hair growth solution. After using Gro Hair Serum for several weeks, I am excited to say this serum has helped.   The Gro Hair Serum comes in a sleek bottle and convenient dropper, making it easy to dispense the right amount of product without any wastage. The packaging is attractive and informative, clearly detailing the serum's ingredients and usage instructions.  The serum has a lightweight and non-greasy texture, which was a big plus for me. Applying it was a breeze, and it quickly absorbed into my scalp without leaving any residue. The serum's pleasant scent was an added bonus, as it made the application process enjoyable.  I have been using the Gro Hair Serum consistently for the past four weeks, and I can confidently say that I have noticed a significant improvement in my hair's thickness and texture. My hair feels stronger and looks healthier, and I have also noticed a reduction in hair fall during showers and brushing."

Recently, Ive been pulling at my edges and that combined with constantly getting protective styles has caused a little balding. I rubbed this on my edges every night for the past 30 days and my edges have grown back thicker than ever! The serum is water-based so I had no issue with it staining my clothes and/or bed wear. It also doesnt have a scent (IMO), so it shouldnt cause any skin irritation. Ive had the nape of my hair cut for about 10 years, and now Im thinking about growing it out with the help of this. Definitely one of the best hair growth serums! This serum was gifted by Vegamour."

Dealing with hair loss due to medication, finding a product that stimulates hair growth without leaving my scalp oily has been a challenge. Thankfully, this water-based serum ticks all the boxes.  Using it consistently after every wash (every other day), I apply it all over my scalp. I love how lightweight it feels and how it quickly absorbs, leaving no residue. Unlike some other products, it doesn't weigh down my hair or compromise its appearance.  While not as potent as Minoxidil, I noticed some new growth and, more importantly, a significant reduction in hair fallout. It has become a key factor in keeping my hair looking and feeling healthy.  What sets GRO Hair Serum apart is its compatibility with clean hair styling. It integrates seamlessly into my routine, allowing me to style my hair without any telltale signs of product use. This has been crucial for maintaining a natural appearance.  Overall, GRO Hair Serum's water-based formula has proven effective in stimulating hair growth and reducing hair fall. It's gentle on my scalp, feels lightweight, and leaves no greasiness. If you're looking for a non-greasy solution to hair loss, I highly recommend giving GRO Hair Serum a try."

The act of massaging the serum into my scalp with my fingertips became a pleasurable part of my daily routine.  The serum's sensation on the scalp is light and invigorating. Its water-based formula ensures that it doesn't build up on the scalp, making it feel clean and refreshing.  I love the flexibility of this product, as I could use it on either wet or dry hair and at any time, AM or PM. I usually applied it on dry hair in the morning, but I also found it worked wonderfully when applied on wet hair at night. The fact that it left no oil residue made it an excellent pre-styling treatment.  Gifted by Vegamour, this serum has transformed my hair care regimen, proving to be an effective and delightful solution to thinning hair. I wholeheartedly recommend it to others seeking a lightweight, versatile, and efficient product for hair thinning concerns."

I tried this product as a hopeful way to grow back those spots that are now missing hair. I received this product as a gift from the brand, so I hate saying this, but I feel like I need to be totally honest with a possible consumer; I saw very little improvement. There was a little bit of hair regrowth, but I dont think it was enough to justify the price and inconvenience of a product like this. I feel like it left behind a residue that caused me to want to wash my hair more frequently then I would like. I also went on a couple of trips and having to bring a bottle of this stuff with me wasnt ideal. I was hopeful because Ive use eye lash serums and they work great for me! So I was thinking maybe this would be similar, but it wasnt. Sadly, I do not recommend.  Gifted by Vegamour."

As for the cons, the only drawback is the price. Despite that, I find this serum to be excellent, and I actually prefer it over the Ordinary Hair Density Serum that I was using previously. The only downside is that I tend to go through it quickly, making it a bit costly.

I noticed a reduction in hair fall out and breakage, which I feel has contributed to the overall volume and thickness of my hair. One of the things I loved about this hair serum is its non-greasy formula. It absorbs quickly and it leaves no build up. The application process is super easy. With just a dropper, I applied the serum directly to my scalp and gently massaged it in. I tried to be consistent and applied it with my morning routine and styled my hair as usual. But there were a few times that I applied before bedtime on dry hair or after my shower on wet hair. Super easy, no mess no fuss. I am absolutely in love with the results, and I couldn't be happier with the length and thickness of my hair.  Pros: * Noticeable increase in hair thickness and length. * Non-greasy formula with no residue left behind. * Easy and convenient application process. * Hair looks healthier and shinier. * Reduced hair fall and breakage.  Cons: * Daily application (but even that was simple)   This product was gifted by Vegamour."

I feel like my hair has become longer and a little fuller at the hairline after using 1 bottle, and that's with forgetting to use this or not wanting to due to oily appearance about half the time.

I started to notice more hair loss with my showers and sparseness around face due to fine hair and the adverse effects of ageing. With this product I can 100% say with confidence that my hair re-growth has improved (I'm seeing a lot more baby hairs), I notice less hair loss when showering, and the thickness of my hair is double. I just wish it helped with splits on already existing hair, but hopefully I'll see less splits with continued use.

It usually takes up to three, six, or even more months to see the first results so dont be discouraged. This serum is also free of toxic chemicals, carcinogens, hormones, or harmful side effects. The formula is water-like, non-sticky and it is absorbed quickly without making your roots look oily. Its super easy to use, you have to massage the serum into the scalp with your fingertips and I think it works better on dry hair. I use it both in the AM and PM and I started to notice less fallout."

Ive tried their shampoo, conditioner, and dry spray, so I know I am getting an excellent product in advance. I tried the hair growth formula every day for two months and appreciated that it was not oily. A lot of the recent products by other brands are oily formulas. I rub in one dropperful in the evening before bed. It doesnt seem to have much of a scent, which is fine. I rub it into my scalp with my fingertips. It is easy to use. It wasnt irritating to my scalp. It feels like water. This would make sense because it is a water-based product. I can use it night or day, on wet or dry hair, because it isnt oily. My hair looks thicker and fuller in areas that I applied it. Would recommend!"

The bottle is expensive and small so it is not ideal if you have a lot of surface area to cover.  The product is also a liquid so you need to be careful how much to dispense from the dropper at a given time.  On several occasions the product just dripped down my forehead onto my face.  I think I would prefer a product that you can spray at the roots onto the scalp.  I will keep using it to see if makes any different in terms of hair growth in the isolated areas where I apply it."

I started using this a few years ago and love it so I'm thrilled that it's now at Sephora. Most growth products in the Black hair industry are oils or heavy serums and cause buildup. But since this is a more watery consistency, I started using it on my hair when I had braids in so I was able to really see the results because I had to have my hair rebraided more often when I was using it consistently. Now I have locs and am similarly seeing clear results, and have to retighten my locs more often. Some say it's expensive, but out of all the hair growth items that are recommended by dermatologists that truly work, such as Nutrifol, this is more affordable. You have to stick with it for 2-3 months (which is 2-3 bottles) to really start seeing results, but it's worth the investment!"

Once doing something about the issue became a serious priority for me I started applying vegamour once a day, (almost - nobody is perfect haha) everyday, just like the bottle says. It didnt take much each time, just one full applicators-worth of serum, and I started to see the signs of new little hairs in under a month. Throughout the subsequent weeks of use I have noticed a substantial improvement in my areas where the hair was starting to really thin out, so much so that I really dont notice the scalp in those parts of my hair any more. I feel better because I look better, and a big part of that is my better hair thanks to vegamour"

I cant tell if I have to wash my hair more often or not but I guess thats good since its not noticeable. This has helped my hair grow in more thick and not as sparse around my hairline area. I also have gotten my boyfriend to use it since he wears hats all the time and it damages his hair and Ive seen results on him also. 10/10!"

Admittedly I haven't been as consistent with it - for example, I forget to use it DAILY so there are times when I have skipped some days. When I saw there wasn't much improvement in hair growth around my temples that's where I stopped using it daily. I did notice an increase in the strength of my hair and less shedding on the days when I used it consistently. I also feel like it has made my hair feel fuller and healthier. The serum itself is very light and felt like water - and it didn't leave my hair greasy or oily, there's no scent. I'm rating this as a 3 simply because after a month and a half I didn't see much hair growth but that could be the lack of consistency and I might try the shampoo/conditioner after."

It does have a slight scent but it disappeared quickly. Its light enough to be used on any hair type. I didnt experience any itching or irritating. And it helped my sparse hair to grow!

The spots are filling out more, not breaking off, and growing longer. I can even see new growth at the front of my hairline where there was no hair before. I also cut my hair short before starting this journey, and I have never seen my hair grow so fast. It feels super refreshing on your scalp and does not leave your hair feeling oily.

You dont need much of it but I still recommend using a generous amount during each application. I apply it about two to three times a week to my scalp and generously massage it in. After the first month, I noticed  the my hair feeling significantly thicker, stronger, and more luscious.

It wasn't shiny bald, I could see my hairs in their follicles, but that spot wouldn't grow and the tiny hairs that did grow around the spot were soo sparse, straight, and wouldn't grow at the same rate as the rest of my hair. This serum brought my hair back to life! Within the first week of using about 1/3 of a dropper daily the density of the area with the tiny, straight hairs was thicker! Within a month the problem spot started growing healthy hairs and my curl pattern came back to the sparse hairs. I've been using the serum for over three months now and I'm only halfway done my first bottle, I love how far it goes if you're just spot treating. I have around 6 tiny curls/coils within the problem spot that continue to grow and the area around the spot is definitely flourishing. The serum is watery, absorbs completely, and smells lightly of rose. It'll take a while for my hair to catch up and even out but it's so much better than it not growing at all! I've tried other oils and products that didn't work but I honestly think my main problem is hormonal so I love this serum and can't wait to see my results when I finally finish my third bottle!!"

Some people might have had a better experience with us because they didnt get insanely sick while using it. I also used other Vegamour products while using this. In general, I have a very positive outlook on the company. The products I used worked really well.  All that being said, I dont really feel like this did a ton for re-growing my hair. My hair is still incredibly thin. I still feel like my hair is very thin in certain spots. I dont know if that is more to do with how sick I got though. Im not really sure. Honestly, I couldve lost more hair from just getting so sick. I will say, my scalp health has been so much better since using this. As a scalp serum, this is really great.   This product does not actually contain any FDA approved ingredients to cause new hair growth. This doesnt have minoxidil in it so its not going to actually cause new hair to grow. I think if you have the right expectations for this product, you probably wont be let down. Make sure you read reviews and look at the ingredients to know what youre getting into. You really do have to use this for the full three months to see any kind of results. Its not something thats going to work overnight. Its not a miracle."

On top of that, I have noticed a HUGE improvement on my scalp health. My hair has never looked this healthy, luscious and in general full of life! My hair has always been dull and lifeless, now even when I dont apply any products to my hair and just let it air dry, you can notice volume and life. Its such a good feeling because I had NEVER gotten a compliment on my hair until yesterday and I know this serum has played a huge role in bringing life to my thinning hair.

This serum bring grow new hairs on the scalp and helps with shedding. Its a slow process but it definitely works. With that in mind, I feel that the shampoo grows hair on the everywhere other than the scalp as in neck or top of the forehead because it is hard to get the product massaged into the scalp. Ive noticed that the shampoo tends to stick to the hair and neck when Im massaging. Another side to the shampoo is that is makes my hair feel squeaky clean. The conditioner makes the existing hair grow longer, more shiny and stronger. Therefore using the serum along with the shampoo and conditioner is best for Ideal results. I totally recommend."

I really like that this product doesn't make unrealistic claims and that it's recommended to use it for a few months in order to see the results. I've been using this serum for 3 months now and I wanted to share my results. The directions tell to use one dropper of serum for the whole head, but since I was only concentrating on my sparser areas near my temples, I used half of the amount applying the serum every day. It's a very watery product and I love how easy it is to apply. Since I didn't use a whole dropper, the bottle lasted me longer than a month. About 2 months into the serum, I thought I had some tiny effect, but I wanted to wait until the recommended time before evaluating the results. Well, that time is now! The hair in mv temple areas are more sparse and they grow very light, but it's not an issue for me. After using the hair serum since August, I do see some extra hair growth and a few darker hairs, but the changes are pretty minimal. I never paid close attention to the hair growth, so I can't tell for sure if it's the result from Vegamour or if it's just how my hair grows. For now, the changes do not justify the cost and time for me to recommend this serum. However, everyone's hair is different and I might just need more time, so I will continue using this serum and hope that the results will be more obvious in the future."

The growth process takes some patience so stick with it! Recommend applying in the evening and spending time to massage into the scalp. The formula is thin so work in small portions also using too much will make hair look dirty. I used primarily at night on wet hair or if planning to wash hair the next morning. My husband has also been using for thinning hair on top and swear its working better for him!! He just wishes the bottle was a different color/not glass for traveling purposes."

Thank you #vegamour #skeepersfamily This three month supplies of Hair Serum is really a game changer for me to at least regain some of my confidant back after losing quite a lot of hair through radiation.  I've tried so many product out there to no avail until I saw this GRO Hair Serum from Vegamour. I was a bit hesitated at first because I didn't want to disappoint myself if I didn't get the result that I was looking for. Moving forward, after months of using this product, the Vegamour GRO Hair Serum has changed my mind. I love the way how slowly and steadily my hair is improving every day. I see a lot of new hair growth on both sides and the font of my head. I noticed that the strand of my hair is getting stronger and appears healthier. I have seen less hair falling out from my hairbrush and that is quite a relief. The serum is easy to apply on the scalp, hair and it feels very comfortable without any irritation or itching feeling.  Although my hair is gradually improving, but so far I'm very happy with the progress that I'm getting from this hair serum. Thanks Vegamour, my hair looks healthier than months ago and I'm literally regain some of my confidant back."

Honestly I can see only a few baby hairs growing after 3 months. This serum takes patience and you might not notice any difference until the end of month one or two. I usually apply it after I wash my hair and when it's damp. Overall, I love this serum and my hair looks healthier.   Cons: The dropper is not enough for the whole scalp and I focused only on the problem area until now. After using this for a month I observed when I stop using this devotedly, the hairfall problem will be back. Initially in the first month of using this I noticed some pimple like bumps on my scalp (near forehead) and slight itchiness persisted for a little while. Not anymore! I really wish this was a little inexpensive so it'll be easier to continue buying."

I can't believe it helps to grow my front hairline back with full-looking hair. It's a watery base serum without any scent. I use 1 dropper at night every day on my scalp and sometimes to the spot I want to grow my hair.  It absorbs very fast, only need to massage my scalp for a min, and done!

Less shedding and my hair feels stronger and feels like they dont break as much anymore. Also the serum does not feel greasy on my hair. Its a really good product if your concern is thinning hair.

I loved that this serum did not make my hair greasy so I could use it in the morning and not worry about it making my clean hair look dirty at work. I've also noticed less hair shedding throughout the 3 months as well, I used to find so much hair on my clothes at the end of the day and that has definitely reduced, so I love that it's not only helping me grow new hair but also protect the hair I've got. The dropper on the bottle is so easy to use and apply too and the packaging is so luxe!!

I was skeptical about applying a serum on my scalp everyday because like I said, I don't wash my hair daily and using my fingers to disperse it felt like I was just going to get more oils on it. However, this serum does not make my hair more oily. It actually feels absorbs quickly into my hair and is light/thin like water. I applied it daily on dry hair at night-time focusing on my hairline and then massaging towards the entire scalp. I do notice a difference in my hair after using it for 3 months. The baby hairs around my hairline look longer and those were stuck at that same length for a long time so I can definitely see a difference now. It's a very lovely serum. I actually enjoyed it very much. I will probably keep using it along with their gummies for overall hair health and growth which is what I want the most."

My scalp has never been so healthy, and i have more new growth than I ever have. One of the things I love most about this product is that unlike some other hair serums that would be for similar use - this one is NOT OILY AT ALL. I put it on my hair before I go to bed, and you literally cannot even tell the next day. Hair growth takes time, and there are so many different factors (stress, diet, etc). Im so excited to see what continued use of this product looks like!"

Onto the results of use after 3 months: it didn't have an incredibly significant effect on hair growth, but did seem to help the integrity of my hair leading to shinier, healthier looking hair strands. It became a familiar supporting hair product that you could tell was offering something to the overall appearance of the hair, especially after brushing and getting the serum totally throughout the head and hair."

As soon as I started using this product I started seeing results, even though I wasn't using it daily as instructed. Later on towards the end of the summer I found the opportunity to try this product for 3 months in exchange for my review and I immediately signed up, because I had some good results using it before. Long story short, I'm so glad I signed up for this opportunity because I now have lots of beautiful baby hairs in the parts that I was pretty much balding. This product works, specially if you are consistent in the application. And it doesn't smell weird or make your scalp itchy like other serums to help prevent hair loss.

My hair looks healthier and feels like there is more volume overall. I also noticed my hair line is getting fuller. You need to be patient to see visible difference and if you miss a day or two, don't worry and keep going. Love that this product is Vegan and Clean."

However, here's what I liked about it and why I'm excited to keep using it for the next 1.5 months (or maybe more!): Using it daily forces me to massage my scalp which in itself is really good for blood circulation and hair growth. Product is clean, vegan and cruelty and sulfate free, I'm a pharmacist and the ingredients are GREAT.  The product leaves no residue and was not oily/greasy, so my hair always looks good after I use it."

For someone like me, with very fine hair, not having thick, healthy locks can certainly improve their hair look, gaining confidence!

I have tried many products in the past to try to add some volume and thickness to my hair, but they've either grown hair in places I do not want hair to be grown, or I saw no difference at all. This product by Vegamour does wonders. I truly see a difference in my scalp, and feel/see new hairs come. Especially when used with Vegamour's other products, such as their vitamins. The only thing is, it takes time to see results. You need at least 3-6 months to see changes. But when you do see the changes - they are worth the wait. Product was not sticky like other hair serums, and smells good as well. I highly recommend"

I noticed some baby hairs in my scalp being less visible after three months it definitely takes some patience because month one or even a month to you might not notice a difference definitely take some photos so you can compare"

I did some research the second time around, used less oil, and used a clarifying shampoo to get the oil all the way out and that was the trick! My hair definitely looks shiny and pretty after using this oil. I havent noticed a huge difference in softness yet but the biggest game changer for me is that after only two uses my hair has stopped shedding so much! Im noticing less hair loss in the shower which is an indicator that the claims this oil prevents breakage is definitely true.   Anyway moral of the story is take your time to understand how to use this product properly the first time around and if you dont like the results at first make some changes before deciding whether you like it or not. Id be willing to bet most bad reviews are from people like me who didnt understand how to use the product properly at first!"

I used the serum on my crown, as well as in dots around the outside of my hair line. I also put a few on the nape. So just a dot all around basically. If you do that & don't use a glob in one spot, it won't make your hair oily or greasy. I didn't have to wash every day or anything. I also used the scalp brush to massage it in.

I enjoy other products from a brand, was also taking biotin vitamins from them. Serum started working. Not the miracle you see in just one use (and not supposed).

All you need to do is apply serum and rub it into your scalp.  Remember to close the dropper so it doesn't evaporate.

I have naturally blonde hair but went even blonder a few months ago and I felt like i was having the worst shedding of my life.  Literally strands/clumps of hair would come out when I washed my hair and I think it was due to the bleaching of my very virgin never bleached before hair.  I started using this a couple weeks ago to try and curb some of the hair loss and while I haven't noticed any extra thickness in my hair (yet, i also do have naturally thick hair) I have noticed a SIGNIFICANT improvement in shedding, like barely noticeable now.  I really only use it on my wet/damp hair right out of the shower, I feel like it makes my hair a bit greasy used on dry hair, the formula can also leave a bit of a sticky residue on my hands after rubbing it in.  I dock one star for the price vs. quantity.  I could see going through this small bottle very quickly if I was using one full dropper every day as recommended and at this price point that can add up very quickly.  Luckily I only wash my hair a couple times a week so hopefully this will last a bit longer.  Also difficult to get a full dropper filled, it usually only goes about half or 3/4 full."

I was cleaning off ny brush twice in one brush session and my shower kept getting clogged because of how much hair I lost. Ive never experienced this with any of my other pregnancies. So when I noticed the front of my scalp was looking less tanned than usual I realized my hair was falling out. I could no longer hide it. I started using this product immediately, without paying attention and using it daily along with my skincare I noticed today when trying to tame flyaways certain hairs just wouldnt sit. And I realized this product was actually doing its job. I couldnt believe it. Mind you Ive been taking vitamins for months now and I know for a fact that this product made the difference and is likely the prime reason my hair is growing back within a month. Its just sprouting, that I hadnt noticed before.  Buy this product. Give it a chance! I hope it works out for you!"

This is easy to use, a dropper lasts for one time use, I used my finger tips to rub the product into my scalp. It didnt leave any residue or make my hair appear oily, it disappeared. A bottle lasts you a month, they claim results with 3 months of consistent use. For the first month itself, I wasnt as consistent I was hoping to be but my baby hair started showing up slowly but consistently. Im convinced this works and if hair loss is an issue, I really think you should give this a try. Note: I stopped taking biotin supplements to ensure the changes were due to this serum and was really surprised. I still have 10-15 days of use left, I was gifted the serum by the brand but I would consider repurchasing it."

            "review_text": "I've used the GRO Hair Serum for Thinning Hair for 3 full months. I personally did not see any difference in my hair or any new baby hair growth starts. I also do not see my individual hairs growing thicker or having any less shedding than before. I have long had issues with hair thinning and have yet to find something that works for me. I think maybe this serum is more suited for temporary hair changes where hair is likely to grow back anyway, like in like stress-related hair loss rather than ongoing problems like I have. As for the bottle, dispensing, and directions; it says to use one dropper full daily and each bottle lasts one month. I have found that the dropper only fills half way up (about 1 inch high), so when I first started using this I was doing one dropper full as stated. I noticed 2 weeks in that I should have been at a half full bottle but I had more so I started using 2 droppers full daily. Since I was applying to my whole scalp rather than a spot treatment this felt right, like I was actually getting the product everywhere it needed to go. So for me 2 droppers full daily works out to one bottle per month. This needs to be addressed in the directions as people might be using too little product as there is no fill line on the dropper and it doesn't fill to the top.  As for texture, this isn't oily and didn't make my hair greasy. I applied it at night and massaged it in. Once dry it is like it was never there so there is no residue. So overall, if you have ongoing hair loss issues this might not be for you as it didn't work for me. If you have temporary hair loss, check the other reviews to see if it works for others in similar situations. If you are spot treating then one dropper might be enough, but for full scalp, you may need 2 droppers."

Before I get into my review, heres some background for context: Im in my late 30s and have been experiencing thinning hair/hair loss, particularly around the crown, for the past 15 years or so. I have hypothyroidism and PCOS which contribute to this.  Ive tried several shampoos, sprays, serums and treatments over the years and nothing has really worked. Im happy to report that this Vegamour serum *actually* helps!  Some cons: At nearly $60 a bottle, the high price tag makes it less accessible. If you stop using it, your hair will go back to how it was prior to useu2026you HAVE to use it consistently and this of course adds up fast. In my experience, I found it to cause small irritation bumps if applied to a non-clean scalp. I prefer to not wash my hair daily and this didnt play well with dry shampoo.   Has it miraculously grown my hair back to a luscious mane full of body? No. But it absolutely has helped to retain hair, grow new hair, lengthen existing hair, and is (very) slowly starting to close in the gap I have on my crown! I also love how easy it is to apply and that it doesnt make my hair greasyu2014something I experienced with most orher products Ive tried.  Together with a healthy lifestyle, this has been such a great tool to bring my confidence back! Im sure many of you reading know how traumatizing it is to experience hair falling out in fist fulls every time you wash or brush your hairu2026Shes pricey, but this Vegamour serum absolutely helps!"

I didnt think I would have to keep using this all the time.  Maybe Ill have to try a 6 month treatment to insure the growth of my hair.  As of now I am worried about losing the new hair I was getting used to."

Thats how I knew it was working. My last bottle in I started to do spot treatment as it says its more effective and sure enough it was !! Im so glad I could experience vegamour! Honestly gave me back my confidence"

Three years ago I visited a new hair stylist and she told me I had a bald spot in the middle, front part of my head, near my forehead. I was so embarrassed and self conscious about it that I started parting my hair to the side to hide it. I didn't really do anything to treat it aside from trying to wear my hair in loose, low styles and only parting it to the side. I was so self conscious about it! When I learned about Vegamour, I was curious and hopeful. I bought my first bottle in Feb 2021, and in Aug 2021 I finally started parting my hair in the middle and felt much more confident. My part looks much more full.   I use it EVERY night after my shower. I literally mean every night. I have probably missed around 12 days where I didn't put it on in the last 10 months because I forgot, so I literally put it on almost every single night. You HAVE to be consistent. I took pics every month and after month two I noticed a difference. SO HAPPY! I am so thankful that I found this because my bald spot was a major insecurity that I finally feel is practically gone. I will continue using it daily until Feb 2022, and then I plan to only use it every other day instead of nightly. THANK YOU VEGAMOUR!"

I say this because  - Any hair growth product has to be used for at least 3 months before you can see results. And some will cause an initial shedding. All vegamour did was create an oily scalp environment, and clog hair follicles. Im not sure why Sephora picked up this company, because in addition to products not working, they were notorious for poor customer service, shipping delays, and etc. I guess putting their product in a shiny new package duped someone in product.  If you want to regrow hair spend your $ on - minoxidil, PRP, red light therapy at 680, address any hormonal issues, and or vitamin deficiencies."

I have Asian hair that is very flat and this did not weigh it down, i was in shock because usually any leave on product will leave my hair looking greasy.. Online it does say you see results in 3 months but my body is sensitive and I saw it very quickly. I'm obsessed. I am hoping Sephora will start to carry instore so it is easily accessible!!"

It works slowly because hair follicles have different growth and dormant phases. The solution (its watery but smells nice) keeps the hair in their growth phase for longer so they keep growing BUT your hair follicles will go back to their default setting once you stop using Vegamour. Translation: You lose all the new hair Vegamour gave you within a month or two of discontinuing it. To maintain the growth, you can use it 3 times a week instead of every day to make it last longer."

I was horrified. Constant shoulder length hair was making me feel crazy. I started using this and really giving the massage part some credence. If you use it at night and aren't showering you wind up with hair that's thicker and easier to deal with. After a few months you notice the baby hairs. After half a year you see your hair has actually started growing and now at a year I have hair past my bra hooks. I live for this. It gave me my confidence back."

I have been using this for the past month or so with the shampoo, conditioner and gummies.  However, I have been using this every day (did not use the shampoo/conditioner daily), including with other shampoos/conditioners in order to test its effect.   I was pleasantly surprised that this did not feel greasy at all - it has a pleasing smell too.  It definitely made my hair easier to style and helped a bit with the frizz.  Its a little pricy but other hair serums I have used in the past (John Frieda, Biosilk, etc) would tend to make my hair greasy if I wasnt super careful. So, for me this is 100% worth repurchasing, and would recommend for others who also have fine/straight hair."

This gave me those vibes. I had previously looked at this product and considered purchasing in the past, but after receiving it for free, I am glad my money was spared. I have fairly thin superfine hair that tangles if you look at it funny, and after trying the instructions of massaging it into my scalp on both damp and dry hair, I got tangles, and had to blow dry my hair because it was wet after trying on dry hair alone. The only way to try it was to drop it on in strategic places and use a wet brush and gently brush it through. I noticed practically no growth in my hair, but did notice my baby hairs at my temples looked a little fuller. The bottle says 30 day supply, but even using a single dropper full, I have excess product, so if I continue to use it, it will take maybe 40 days per bottle. I do not plan on continuing however, because it was too much of a hassle adding it in my very tight morning schedule, and had minimal results, even if they tell you it takes 3-4 months for any real results."

You have to use it once daily to see results, but its as light as water in your hair with no residue."

Some people might see a difference within a couple months, others it might take a little longer. Once I stopped looking every day for change, I'd say I noticed a nice difference at about 4 months. Also, one bottle will last you a full month if you apply it properly. I see people complaining about this all over here. I just put a drop on each problem area and then add a few more randomly and then massage it all through my hair with my fingertips. I do it on my dry hair at night, and I don't wake up with any greasiness."

Its hard to keep the dropper from dripping the product on the counter or floor. Which is a waste. Its also hard to distribute the product on my scalp and massage in.

The pros are that this stuff smells great, and it feels kind of luxurious giving myself a scalp massage each night before bed. (Not to mention, my hair looks super voluminous afterward!) It doesn't make my hair feel greasy either while applying the serum or after the fact - just feels like putting sweet smelling, cool water on my scalp.  I don't quite feel like a dropper-full is enough to cover my whole scalp, but that's how much they say to use, so I've just been trying to put the drops in a different part each night, hoping it evens out.

Before you buy, I suggest you see how difficult it is to spread evenly on your scalp even 1 fluid ounce of water. Then imagine being expected to do the same with one-thirtieth (1/30) of that amount, which is what you'll need to do for the bottle to last you a month.   From my experience, unless you have a bald head, the liquid will be absorbed by your hair follicles and evaporate within seconds of you attempting to blend it in. You'll arguably be creating friction and doing more damage to your existing hair by rubbing your very dry fingertips across your scalp each day trying to apply this product.   You know what I can say that's positive? The packaging is not that bad! I just went to look at my last empty glass bottle and noticed that the label is not a stick-on. It's just unfortunate, for me, because I value high-quality products more than high-quality packaging.   After 3 bottles, I did not see a single difference, and I do not believe this company works in good faith. Although I am disappointed that Sephora is backing this brand, hopefully, this means that Vegamour cannot continue to censor honest reviews."
