This is a little more expensive than the drugstore one I used to use (loreal maybe?) but I found those tubes always almost empty on buying, clumpy and gummy. This doesn't feel greasy, but thicker than water, and doesn't harden or clump on the lashes. I think it keeps them more fanned out than just brushing them, but it doesn't have much hold, probably wouldn't keep a curl. It doesn't make my lashes grow like the serum, which was outrageously fast, but they do grow a little longer, and they don't fall out, which is all I really wanted. It does have a STRONG fragrance when you first open it, aggressively floral, I could smell it all day, but the more I used it, the less it smelled like anything, so it was quite a temporary problem. I tend to be very allergic to things, and it didn't make me sneeze, it was just too strong. The formula has never bothered my skin, or even my eyes, which I'm sure I've rubbed it into once or twice."

I feel the GrandeRepair lash conditioner is very well formulated. It has a bunch of ingredients that you will find in pricier products, it\u2019s a really good value for the money and an excellent choice for those who don\u2019t want to use lash serums with cloprostenate or bimatoprost. Personally I use it once a day at night along with the GrandeLash serum, which I\u2019ve been using on and off since 2013.   I found that the GrandeRepair lash conditioner paired with the GrandeLash serum gave me thicker-looking lashes vs using GrandeLash on its own, and I definitely have less lash loss. The problem with using the GrandeLash serum long term is that my lashes have synchronized on the same growth cycle, they tend to fall out at the same time every couple of months then I have to wait until the next growth cycle kicks in for my lashes to come back (I hope that makes sense, I haven\u2019t seen anyone else talk about it because most reviews aren\u2019t from a long-term user). While using the GrandeRepair serum at the same time I\u2019ve definitely noticed less lash loss over the growth cycle, that alone makes it worth purchasing again and again.   The serum does dry a bit crusty and tends to clump the lashes together, that\u2019s why I use it at night. If you really wanted to use it during the day you\u2019d have to get a lash comb to comb out the clumps before the serum dries. But that\u2019s a minor inconvenience compared to the huge benefits I get out of it. I hope they never discontinue this product."

Mine are typically brittle and stumpy, and it usually takes tons of mascara to make it look like I have nice eyelashes. I really noticed a difference after applying mascara. One coat, and they look long and gorgeous compared to my usual lashes. My left lash line up top is kinda patchy and uneven, but I swear it looks normal again thanks to this stuff. It's easy to apply, the wand is sturdy and just the right size. I even liked the smell of the conditioner. I typically apply it in the evening, but maybe I'll give it a shot in the morning to see how it works as a primer under my mascara. This is so worth the price, and I wholeheartedly recommend it. I'm going to continue to use it daily, and I'll definitely be purchasing it once I run out."

The instructions were clear, easy to apply, and has no smell. It doesn\u2019t sting the eye at all and seemed quiet gentle on the skin compared to other brands - no redness or reaction.

The conditioner consistency is a lot lighter and less viscous than comparable lash serums I've tried previously which I love. After all, nobody's wants heavy weighed down lashes! I also appreciate that the lash wand is on the smaller side and doesn't come out deeply saturated with product allowing for more precise application. I'm up in the air whether this conditioner has made a big enough difference to warrant the price, but my lashes feel do softer and more moisturized so I'll continue using it for now! My main compliant is that I absolutely hate the texture of the outside of the container, but that's probably just a picky thing on my part!"

If you\u2019re struggling with brittle lashes that have started to point in different directions (my problem), I highly recommend this. I\u2019ve been using it for 4 weeks and I see an actual, palpable difference in my lash strength. My mascara also looks so much better when I use this as a primer.

From what I can tell it looks like other people are using this at the same time as they use the GrandeLash MD Serum.   Don't do that! I don't think the products are meant to be used in conjunction with eachother. Others seem to be using it at night. Don't do that either! You apply it directly to your eyelashes so the product is going to get in your eye while you sleep. You can put castor oil on your eyelashes and it will irritate your eyes while you sleep. That's common sense to me lol.  I like to use this product during the day, on days I don't wear makeup or mascara. I have noticed less lash fall-out when I do choose use mascara.   I love the serum, and I love this conditioner. I found it for sale on the GrandeLash website and that's where I tried it.  Highly recommend!"

Even when I stopped the curling and the rapid lash, I found that the were still dryer, more coarse, etc. Despite cleaning more often and taking care of my allergies, diet and hormones, still no luck.   This conditioner, which is more cream-like or balmy, than a water light serum,  helped me get my lashes back. It also helped them grow longer and thicker than ever, even without the grande lash serum. It only took a couple of weeks. I also added the grande lash serum and saw even better results but am still waiting on one or two bare areas to fill back in.   All in all, I'm very pleased about the amount of product we receive, its consistency, and the results. I think my only issue may be with the applicator, which sometimes applies globs of the product that you have to work through other lashes. Good thing it dries clear."

It is a clear/white-ish (dries clear) serum that\u2019s dispersed on a mascara wand that you brush on your eyelashes. I feel like it\u2019s very conditioning and after a few days of use I noticed my lashes felt like they were more conditioned for sure.
