            "review_text": "I've purchased both of these products in other scents. the hand cream works well - definitely has a strong candy-like watermelon scent, like a jolly rancher or something. The lip balm is a pass, almost just sits on top of the lips and dries out fairly quickly. seems like my lips are drier after somehow? i've never had this issue with other scents so maybe it's just this one? or the formula has changed since my past purchase?"
