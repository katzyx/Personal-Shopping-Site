HOWEVER I can see why someone would love this mascara--it darkens the eyelashes in a super natural way that makes it look like your eyelashes are just that way without makeup. It also separates them well without any clumps. I use it on my bottom lashes and recommend to someone looking for that natural look!"

I can confidently say this Buxom mascara is a ride or die. I wouldn’t wear it alone for an event. It layers nicely with other mascaras, but the best part about it is : no fall out, flakiness, curls and separates lashes—doesn’t get clumpy. The way the product comes out is better than 99.99% of mascaras. You know how you have to wipe away some of it on most? Totally unnecessary with this one. It pulls the product out at just the right amount.   I don’t know about you, but when I’m getting ready to go to work I do not have the time for a random eye flutter and waiting for mascara to dry on my lid or under my eye to brush off. My time in the morning is limited (I.e., no time for mistakes or a heart attack<—dramatic, yes). I’m any case, I’m actually buying a full size—pigs must be flying."

I have never received a sample and went to go purchase the full size product other than now. What I like about this mascara is firstly the brush, its simple and that's what I like about it. It reaches all your lashes and when you remove the wand from the bottle the excess product is removed leaving you with a ready to apply wand. This mascara is dry wet consistency which sold me on the product. If your eyelashes fall very easily after curling them and applying as mascara I'd highly recommend trying out this one. It is dry enough that it keeps my eyelashes standing up without making them clumpy. Want a longer eyelash look? Wiggle the want at the top of your lashes and the job is done. Want a fuller eyelash look? Apply more starting at the root of the eyelash! I cannot say enough good things about this product, the other bad reviews surprise me honestly. I guess it's the same as how some other high-end mascaras from Sephora just don't work for my eyelashes."

Without a doubt every single time I use this quite a bit of mascara is smudged onto my eyelid, especially when I attempt to even go near the base of my lashes.

The brush does a good job of removing any clumping, a look I am not a fan of. My lashes look longer, fuller, and all around better and it just stays put. Don't stop making this one.  It is a keeper."

If you are looking for a natural looking healthy boost this is it. If you want dramatic, then this is not the formula. I have sensitive skin and eyes and this did not irritate me what so ever. I have purchased this numerous times and the product is consistent. I am 37 and own a ton of makeup and cosmetics. This is my go to.

Loved it so much I came and got another one, then another one and then another etc. I’m probably on my 6-7th tube now. It doesn’t clump when you apply, gives great long lashes, lasts all day long and the brush has many little spikes on it to really help separate your lashes when applying. Only draw back is on the full size tube after about 5-6 months it does like to clump a little. Just wash your brush real good and it helps. That really is the only drawback I’ve come across. I have sensitive eyes (like seriously wearing eyeliner/eyeshadow can bother me greatly and cause red eyes and irritation) and this mascara doesn’t bother my eyes at all. I can wear everyday and have no issues. Usually I just wear a light bb cream, blush/highlighter and this mascara most days and I have no issues. Even have people here and there compliment my eyelashes. I don’t wear falsies either.   If you’re looking for a great mascara I seriously suggest you try this out. You can always get the travel size first and then go from there. I bet you come back and get the full size tube. Today I’ll be buying another since my little niece decided my mascara wand was a “magic wand” and wanted to clean it off with soap and water because it was dirty and then color all over my bathroom counter and sink and walls etc. my husband asked by not just get something from Fry’s or Walgreens etc it’s cheaper?! I’m like are you serious, they suck that’s why. Buxom is the only one I use and it’s what I’m getting if I have to order it online and wait for it!

It’s 10/10 for length but probably 6/10 for volume. Since I use this for my everyday look, I prefer the more “natural” look this mascara gives so I don’t mind the lack of volume. I’ve worn this mascara for up to 18 hours and it wears amazing! It doesn’t flake or run. Also the application is by far the easiest and quickest of any mascara I’ve tried! I can easily apply to both eyes in 5 minutes! Overall I’ve had an amazing experience with this mascara and would highly recommend it to anyone who’s looking for an easy, quick and natural mascara!"

Always see so much fall out in my makeups wipes, I’m very gentle when taking off my makeup so I was shocked to see so many lashes when I take this off. This is not something that normally happens to me as I’ve used many different mascaras in the past, seriously so many.

I have really sensitive eyes so this mascara is really great for that as it has more natural ingredients and doesn’t flake. I have deep set eyes that are between almond and round, and I have fairly long blonde eyelashes.

Judging by appearances, I figured it would be basic and low quality. I gave it a try and ended up liking it a lot. It gave length and volume, but most importantly it also provided a smooth and even coat on each lash without clumping and sticking together. I also found that it didn't flake by the end of the day and it seemed to hold out quite well on long-wear days too. I prefer mascara that is gentle on your lashes - one that won't cause them to fall out or break over time. I don't know if this one is actually formulated for clean ingredients but I didn't have issues with my lashes while I was using this mascara.

They got rid of their buxom stand at this particular store, but one of the workers helped me find the full version. I will never use another mascara again. I do have fairly long eye lashes, so applying it is easier and I see better results so I may be a bit biased, but it doesnt make my lashes stick together when applied correctly. (very gently and from top to bottom)  and makes them look super long!! I feel like i have lash extensions on when I use this. (I would never lol)"

I applied the lipstick and immediately felt a tingling feeling on my lips. The tingles turned into a cooling effect, but after some time I didn’t ever notice my lips look any plumper. That’s the only real down side to this formula. It wore really well after hours of me drinking/eating! I really love the shade I received and I think that the lipstick provided very opaque coverage.

The mascara formula is amazing because clumps? No where! Absolutely great formula that beautifully separated my lashes, while giving them volume and making them appear even longer! I use it daily now and when night time comes to remove it, it comes off nice and easy! Also, if you happen to get a little of product elsewhere on your face, let it dry and then use a q-tip to sweep it away-voila!! I love personally using the beautiful wand shape by blinking and wiggling the mascara wand upward (or downward for my lower lash line) which gives me the full effect of the mascara. I DEFINITELY recommend this beautifully formulated mascara to anyone wanting longer, volumized lashes without the clumpy mess many leave behind!

Sooooo when I opened up this mascara I was pleased to find that the brush is huge and is very defined . I put it to the test and it did a great job of separating my lashes and I was able to layer it without it getting clumpy or too thick (no spider lashes here!). The real test was wearing it for a few days, including wearing it to work during a 12 hour shift.

It was so big it was hard to apply in small areas such as my bottom lashes and the inner corner of your eye without jabbing your eyes and getting mascara all over it. If that was changed then it would be a really good mascara for length not so much volume or thickness."

I applied two coats and my lashes looked evenly coated, long and dark. My tip would be to always allow the first coat to dry before adding the second. I love this mascara!

The package is very simple but and pretty.  Tip: when applying the mascara, take the excess product so your eyelashes don't look clumpy.

I do like to use this with a lash primer, as it does not add much for length. The primer I use is white, so to cover it well, I first apply with normal strokes, brushing up from underneath the lashes, then I’ll bring the brush down from the top of my lashes - trying only to hit the tips, because any closer and I get mascara all over my kids- and I twirl the brush as I’m bringing it down to catch the lashes and get them all coated really well. I finish with another couple swipes from underneath to separate again.   The brush is the best part - the bristles are stiff (silicone I believe) and separated well, this is what gives the great fanning effect. I mush prefer this over a typical wiry brush because I think it helps prevent smearing/smudging the mascara as well.   Great formula too. Not too thick, not too runny, and doesn’t flake. It’s not waterproof, but I have cried with this before and it didn’t go bleeding down my face either.   Overall, EXCELLENT product."

There is never any clumping (a problem I had with the Too Face 'Better than Sex' mascara) which is awesome, because the last thing I need is flakes or chunks of mascara falling in my eye and causing irritation. My skin is incredibly sensitive to just about everything, and Buxom is one of the few brands that doesn't cause a reaction. Even with some mascaras, I'll notice my eyelids puff up or become red and irritated, but this one has caused me no problems. The only downside is when it is freshly applied, my lashes will sometimes stick together, so I comb them out before the mascara dries."

Buxom, though is much better in so many ways!! It lengthens like crazy, is buildable, and has a good amount of volume without looking heavy or fake. I feel like my lashes look stellar but still super natural. I tried the waterproof version first, but found it too difficult to remove with normal make-up remover. This one, though, comes off very easily with remover at night. It does transfer a tiny amount if you wear it for over 9 hours (which I do with work), but it's very durable and easy to touch up under your eyes after a work-day if you need to move straight into the night and keep it going. Buy it - you won't regret it!!"

Buxom is such an underrated company, so this product is not as well known as Too Faced's Better than Sex or Benefit's They're Real!, but this mascara holds it's own.

All of this combined gives your eye makeup a natural and dramatic look. I've gone through at least ten bottles of this, and I don't think I'll ever switch up!"

Bonus 6. you can use the whole bottle and it won't dry out... I have used other mascara's in the past that would clump or dry out before i got halfway thru it. But not Buxom.

			"review_text": "So there is a love hate relationship between me and mascara. Looks good, but I debate the trouble it’s worth because it is hard to find a great formula. You never know if what works for someone else will work for you. So here’s the skinny on this product. Granted experiences may differ depending greatly on preference and the time from when you first open the product to using it. Also other various factors, but trying to keep this short as possible. I will admit. When I first tried the mascara, it was clumpy. But I was warned it would be this way! It was recommended to me by a coworker and fellow Sephora junkie that when it is first opened the product is not that great. She advised me to use another mascara in conjunction with it. Generally the formulas in the “fatty” mascaras as she called it helped when starting out on it. I’m not sure if that mattered, but I used my old cover girl one that was starting to run empty. Apparently the more air exposed to Buxom’s mascara the better it becomes, but it can take a bit so starting it was tricky. Now I use just the Buxom mascara and no complaints. It will flake after long hours of wear like a day+ of wear. If you are an avid mascara wearer new to this product I would sample before buying and keep in mind that even still a full-size one may need to be aerated if you find it’s clumpy. I also recommend twirling the brush when applying, and making sure to skim the excess off back in the tube as it comes out with a lot. Thank you! Wishing you success on this product!"

I have light-colored naturally long lashes so I prefer mascara that adds a little length and darkens them.  Although a good mascara, I wasn't wowed by this product like many other reviewers. It wears nicely most of the time but smudges occasionally under the eyes and on rare occasions I would see a couple flakes. My favorite part is that this gives a very nice curl to the lashes when I roll the brush while applying. I didn't like getting poked with the wand bristles when applying mascara to my lower lashes. It gives raccoon eyes during a workout which isn't flattering and since I work out most days but don't want to wear waterproof mascara daily, this isn't going to be a staple for me."

			"review_text": "I've tried a vast array of mascaras over the years and this is the first non-tubing (and cruelty-free) mascara that I can truly call Holy Grail.  I have severely oily eyelids and mascara transfers to my brow bone very easily (so much so that I can only use this mascara or tubing mascara when I'm going to be doing anything physically active that may cause me to sweat or if I'm just going to be wearing my makeup for over 12 hours). I also have naturally long lashes, but they are very straight and very light at the ends, so for an everyday mascara I'm looking for something that will darken, lengthen, separate, and hold a curl. This checks all the boxes for me.  I curl my lashes first, then apply one coat of this mascara and it makes it look like I have lash extensions. (It still looks nice with two coats but I've always been a 'one-coater' kind of girl.) It never clumps, the stopper in the tube is actually fantastic so you never get too much mascara on the wand that you need to scrape off or waste, and the wand design (though it may look a tad stabby) really helps separate and define my lashes. And of course, best of all for anyone with oily lids, it does not transfer throughout the day (that being said, I never have issues with any mascara transferring under my eyes so I can't comment on that specifically but I imagine it would hold up in that regard as well.)  Also, I've tried both the mini and the full size and I can say they really do perform the same (unlike a lot of mascaras)."

One swipe leaves no clumps, however I apply multiple times (short lashes!) so there is some clumping - it's not that magical. However it's easily fixed with a lash brush. I would say this is more of a lengthening than a volumizing mascara, the brush is not as amazing as some others but that is what you sacrifice for not a lot of clumping. It still makes your lashes look great though and I love it for an everyday look mascara. This does leave some smudges under my eyes after around 6 hours of wear but they are not as bad as some other mascaras I have tried. This may be less of a problem with the waterproof version but I have not tried that because I hate trying to take off waterproof makeup! Finally this mascara removes easily with makeup wipes, micellar water, or cleansing oil so I'm very satisfied with this!"

It looks like I have thick beautiful lashes when I have this mascara on. I got my roommates and friends on this mascara and they also fell in love. I apply the Dior mascara primer first and then I apply this mascara on and MY GOD it’s AMAAZZINNG. I definitely recommend using it with a primer first if you want a more dramatic look but even without a primer it still looks amazing."

I think a couple of flakes came out when I pulled the brush out for the first time. After a few swipes on my lashes, there was no visible product whatsoever, so I ran the brush across the back of my hand and hardly any pigment came off. I decided to try my Diorshow sample instead, which I loved and could instantly see in one swipe!

Rather, I looked like I had such naturally amazing lashes that I didn't need them.  Why, then, do I feel the need to remove half a star? Because getting there requires a ton of effort. More specifically, this mascara feels like it takes you from 0-100. While many coats lead to the glamorous look I described, two coats do not look like anything, due to how fine and thin the bristles are. This is a problem for me, because I do not always have ten minutes to spend on my lashes. Because two coats don't cut it with this mascara, it's difficult to integrate into my busy morning routine. This is a stunning mascara, but the amount of effort required to achieve full results limits its versatility."

It gave my lashes a nice and natural look but wasn't overpowering, it lasted through me bawling my eyes out from a movie, and fulfills its promise to be clump free. Now, if I'm being honest, I'm not the best at applying makeup, especially eye makeup. This mascara was easy to apply although it does take a bit to dry. I will definitely be buying again."

I achieved amazing definition even for the small lashes in the center and underneath. It is easy to build on so you can go for more than 1 coat without clumping. It's great for a natural look too, so some days you might not need eyeliner. The brush is actually long enough so you don't have to worry about avoiding corners with the dreaded mascara filled tip of the wand like you do with other products.

I normally go for the thick (Urban Decay Perversion type) wands that really grab and layer on the product. This wand is gentle in comparison but it is super efficient. It works into every little hair and coats evenly. I think that is why this is the first mascara I've ever used that really is clump proof with patient application. No flaking. A bit of transfer after 6-8 hours because I wear sunscreen but minimal compared to others. I love how a quick coat or two gives my lashes a natural look with volume the roots and a nice tapered end. The thick blocked off tarantula leg tips on eyelashes are a pet-peeve, for me. I really didn't expect the vitamin enriched formula to pay off but after using this for the last month my lashes are getting a little thicker. I can see how this would not work for anyone with lashes on the shorter side. It really isn't a dramatic mascara. You aren't going to get false lash thickness or super extended length but if you're going for natural at it's best, this is something you should try."

The bristles are so soft and don't hurt your eyelid like some other cheap plastic Wands. The brush is straight and gives you that perfect cat eye look. I loooove the formula- non clumpy, doesn't transfer, adds perfect amount of volume and amazing length. I have pretty decent lashes for a girl, they can easily hold a .15 extension.

Also, I can see how this mascara would be good for people with shorter and/or thinner lashes as well, since the brush has short bristles, making it very precise, and allowing it to get all the way to the end of your lashes to make them as long as possible. I definitely recommend this mascara and regret not buying it sooner!!"

It doesn't flake off through out the day and lasts as long as my work day which can range 5-9 hours (outside).   Kind of Cons... it is slow drying so I have to keep my eyes mostly closed while it drys otherwise I get black spots on my eyeshadow and brows. The non water proof is exactly that, not water proof so don't get caught in the rain or a sob story or you'll be a racoon. The wand is huge and takes some getting used to, but once you do.. WABAM!

It separates my lashes and adds insane length and a bit of volume, yet they still look natural and pretty; no clumps at all. The wand shape is quite similar to the hourglass shape of better than sex's applicator, however the bristles are rubber.

Start all the way at the base and work all the way to the top, then, after a couple of coats, just hit the tips a little, which gives you the length."

Furthermore, I have sensitive eyes, and this formula doesn't irritate them at all. Minimal to no flaking as well. Some people prefer the wall of lashes you can get from a thicker formula, so if that's you, I would go for something thicker and more volumizing. This one is perfect for achieving ultra-separated, long, dark lashes. I've had people ask me before if I'm wearing false lashes and then clarify that I didn't seem to be wearing mascara but have impossibly great eyelashes. So, bam. Best mascara in the world."

I LOVE the false lash look without the false eyelashes because I wear contacts and it irritates my eyes like no bodies business. I used lancome hypnose drama for a while which was great for volume, but not for lengthening. i also used the lancome cils booster primer and it still wasn't what i wanted. i finally switched to Dior Maximizer primer and i LOVE it. i tried Dior Extase, Iconic Overcurl, and the OG Diorshow and none of them gave me what i wanted. Lots of clumping, and not very long. I finally tried this because of the brush. i figured a plastic/rubber brush would help with clumping. I heard this didn't have much volume though. so i use this on top of my dior primer and it's amazing! clump free, separated, VOLUMIZED, LONG, lashes. it's absolutely perfect. and it holds curl so amazingly!"

I had very very high expectations on this mascara from all the great reviews I read, and it not only met my expectations, but greatly exceeded them! Before buying this mascara, I was a huge fan of the Benefit They're Real mascara, and I still am, however this is now my new go to mascara for a number of reasons. 1) I got way more length in my eyelashes than I ever got with They're Real 2) The formula goes on A LOT smoother and as the mascara dries out (which isn't as fast as They're Real so it might last a little longer) I don't have nearly as much flaking as I did with They're Real 3) I only need to use one layer for my lashes to suit my preferences whereas I would have to use two layers for They're Real 4) I can be REALLY clumsy when applying my mascara and tend to accidentally stab myself in the eye more often than I'd like to admit, and the brush on this wand is sooo much softer and less pokey than the brush for They're Real, and yet I still find it applies mascara a lot better I honestly have an endless amount of good things to say about this mascara, so I'm just gonna skip to the bad.... This mascara can be quite runny and I always notice that when I've been yawning a lot that day, I have black streaks under my eyes from the mascara running, and I realize its not the waterproof one, but neither is the Benefit They're Real mascara, and I never had this problem with that mascara. However I think this problem could be easily solved by just opting for the waterproof version of this mascara instead. And on a side note, I didn't notice too much extra volume with this mascara so if you want one that's volumizing, this may not be the mascara for you despite the description saying that its ultra-volumizing."

Dior's is too wet when you first get it that it clumps and smears easily. This mascara is the exact opposite. It lengthens and thickens without clumping.

Im not very good at putting on makeup, but this goes on perfectly without much effort. Originally i had bought the mini version with some points, and thats when I fell in love. I wish they made that size available again, i would buy like 10 of these and keep one in every bag, my car, etc. And one more awesome thing -- the tube lasts a REALLY long time. I use it at least once a day, if not twice, and have had the same tube since march! Cannot recommend this more. Better than dior show, WAY better than Benefit they're real.

I guess I am looking for a permanent mascara that will allow me to transition from day to night with a few swipes. Other than that, I like that it goes on semi-wet, dries quickly, and the bristles are great to coat the bottom lashes.

The wand is small making it difficult to apply, the formula dries very quickly, it's a bit flaky, and the worst part is the smudge factor - this does not last all day.

I've tried most of them out there, but none have compared - Too Faced Better Than $ex (flaked and clumped), Diorshow (not enough length, dried out fast), Benefit They're Real (heavy and smeared), Ciate Triple Shot (no volume, very spidery), MUFE Smoky Extr. (smeared and clumped), Lancôme hypnose volumizing (not volumizing enough), Guerlain maxi lash (no volume or length) - the list really does go on. I use Buxom on both my top and bottom lashes, and what I really like about it is that if I want to be super super dramatic for a special night, I can layer another mascara (lately Urban Decay Pervasion) on my top lashes and it doesn't clump with the Buxom underneath. Also love that it doesn't dry out fast (or at all!) and I can have consistently nice lashes every time I use it. This is a complete win for me and I highly recommend it."

I love the brush and the formula. It finds and coats EVERY lash, separates, adds length and volume, won't flake or come off and give you awful raccoon eyes. I can work a 12 1/2 hour shift and there's nothing under my eyes. It's also very versatile and buildable without getting dry or clumpy. You can easily go from a natural everyday look to a dramatic look that's great for nights on the town or special occasions. It comes off easily with makeup remover or when you wash your face. You don't have to rip out half your eyelashes to get it off like with some I've tried either. It could also be a great base for another mascara. I've used a coat of this with Better Than Sex over it and wham! It's great and I highly recommend it to anyone.

I used to use Benefit They're Real Mascara, I had a very very hard time removing They're Real mascara and I thought they looked more clumpy. This Buxom Lash Mascara gives SUCH a better look, separates much better and is so much easier to remove than They're Real. The formula is easier to work with to separate the lashes, as it is less sticky.  This gives the look of really intense lashes.

When I opened it for the first time the next day I only then realized how big the brush was which made me a little dissapointed as I prefer smaller brushes (my eyes are small). So I then went ahead and swept the mascara wand up to my lashes, sorta expecting them to clump, and was presently surprised! This mascara actually does what it claims to do! Defines, separates, and volumizes! Even after one coat I could see a difference! Although the formula is a little too wet for my taste, it doesn't clump at all. The brush size may take some getting used to for me (if you like a big brush then this mascara is for you!) but aside from that I like this mascara and I like that it separates and lengthens my lashes without having to put on many coats! I'm pretty satisfied!  Pros and cons, in my opinion...  Pros: -Defines and separates -Thickening/volumizing -Lengthening -Doesn't clump -Pigment is the blackest black I've ever seen  Cons: -Gigantic brush (hard to not get mascara on your eyelid, unless careful) -Formula is very wet"

I have also found that the brush easily and evenly covers all my upper lashes and even goes on smoothly to my lower lashes, which are long and sparse (definitely a mascara challenge) without smudging onto my skin. To add another detail, which personally I really like, just the right amount of product comes out with the brush when removed. I have encountered too many mascaras that deliver too much product (which probably adds to the dreaded clump--when not seeking clump--factor) so this really allows you to apply just as many layers as you'd like, though I typically find that I don't get super falsies-thick lashes even after several coats (which suits me just find unless I'm going for that look).

If you have medium/long but fine lashes this will make them POP! My lashes look 3 times bigger and longer and defined (NO CLUMPY MESS EITHER!)  I heard some people don't think this mascara and say that it goes on thin. Well, that is true when you buy it brand new, however it doesn't take much to build it up with a few coats.  The real winner for me is that this mascara gets even more better as it ages. As it ages the formula starts to get less thin and more thick (probably from collecting air when taking the wand in and out) as this happens I notice it can have the effect I want without adding more coats AND its does not clump on me! One of these lasts me 3-4 months...probably even longer. And I mean that. I don't have any problems with irritation or redness from this mascara. It is truly a godsend and worth every penny!  Buy yourself a sample size one and try it out for a few weeks!"

I can add 2-3 coats in the morning and if I decide to touch up later in the day I don't end up with spider-looking eyelashes. It comes off fairly easy with a good eye make-up remover or using a washcloth with soap and water. A great product!"

The brush is amazing, and I've been using it every day for MONTHS and I'm still not done with it. I can wear just one swipe each for a more subtle look or build and build to create amazing lashes. The black doesn't fade during the day, my lashes look thicker and longer, and it doesn't flake into my eyes even if I'm wearing it for 12 hours. I love this.  I bought the full size and still haven't had to crack it open. Love love love this mascara. ♥"

No need to keep applying it over and over. Also, does not flake or smudge and washes off easily with soap and water.

It's incredibly lengthening and decently volumizing, which is what I look for in a mascara. However, I do recommend that you buy the sample tube. Why? After 6-8 months, the product begins to dry out. I understand that there are methods of liquefying them again, so that could be a possible solution. Anyways, I normally enjoy dryer mascaras. But this one doesn't perform nearly as well when it dries out. It becomes flaky and clumps easily. On my medium length lashes, it doesn't look very good. I say to get the sample because it has so much product in it and it lasts around 9-10 months if you don't use it too much. I wear it almost everyday, and I still have plenty in the tube and I've been using it since November. It has just began to dry out for me. But I've had three tubes of this mascara (two samples, one full size), and each time I've had to repurchase one after around eight months. So, I definitely recommend getting the smaller one. It will save you so much money, unless dry mascaras work really well on your lashes. All mascaras look differently on different lashes. Anyways, it's up to you and your preferences. I hope this review helped :)"

It very nicely separates my long, thin lashes (being thin other mascaras sometimes clump them together a bit). The brush in the free sample was just a bit shorter and actually worked better than the full size. The full size brush is a bit overwhelming. I will advise, definitely do not wear this if your eyes water or if you will cry, sweat, or swim. The slightest bit of water makes it dramatically pour off your lashes and streak down your face. :) That's not so pretty. Less thickening than some mascaras but the super-dark shade really gives a nice pop. I like it!"

It stays on even through crossfit and spin and gives me longer lusher lashes. It also isn't a nightmare to get off. No crazy raccoon eyes. I'm pretty impressed.

Unfortunately, although the brush itself was okay and it didn't irritate my eyes quite as much as other mascaras with this type of brush have in the past, I'm still not happy with this. In fact, I'm pretty sure the formula gave me an eye infection. I don't want to use it anymore. It worked well enough though, so I guess everyone who is less sensible to those types of brushes should be fine!"

After curling my lashes, any other mascara I've ever used has weighed them down and pulled the curl straight out. This formula is not heavy, dries fairly quickly but will allow you to mold your lashes once the mascara is on to ensure they're staying curled or even curl them more! One coat of mascara for me is usually good for daytime, but this formula is very buildable and three coats has me looking like I have on false eyelashes. Another perk of this formula and packaging is that it lasts FOREVER. I'm talking 9 months with one to two coats daily. It's amazing. I've tried DiorShow, Too Faced Better Than S**. Tarte Lights, Camera, Lashes, Benefit's They're Real!, and several others by Dior, Bare Minerals, Lancome, Clinique, Smashbox, the list goes on and on. I've been using this formula now for 2 years and every now and then decide to try out something new but I always always come back to my favorite Buxom Lash! If you have trouble getting your lashes to stay curled do yourself a huge favor and try this mascara! After all, with Sephora's fabulous return policy if you don't like it, return it!"

I now have two samples of this which will hopefully last me a looong time. But, when they run out I intend on buying more :). Not going back to the drugstore brand."

You can also use the end of the brush to fill-in and it works really well that way. It holds a curl pretty decently (my eyelashes are straight and require an eyelash curler).If the curl relaxes a bit as the day goes on, you can re-curl without your lashes sticking to the eyelash curler or losing lashes. Buxom Lash also does not have a nasty, chemical smell. It smells faintly pleasant. My eyes are sensitive and it does not make them red or irritated and most mascaras do. Buxom Lash is the total package!! You will never regret the purchase and if you want to try it, the .20 size still has the full-sized brush, just on a a shorter wand. It still works fabulously and seems to last quite a while. Treat yourself to great-feeling, great-looking, naturally thick and voluminous lashes that last."

			"review_text": "First off- Am I the only one who didn't know this line was by Bare Escentuals?? In honesty, I wouldn't have purchased it if I'd known ahead of time, just because BE isn't exactly known for their mascara. I worked for them years ago, and their mascara wasn't bad, just a bit old-school. (just a generic wand, nothing great) This stuff, however, is fantastic. Glad I was fooled!  It did take a while to get used to it, the beginning couple of days were met with some goopy application, but thankfully nothing I haven't faced before even with premium mascara... it wasn't clumpy or hard upon application.  What I love about this mascara is that it defines and also bulks up my fair lashes. I have enough length, but in mascara I look for something to make my lashes dark! Period! My eyes are very dark brown, but I have naturally light hair- so if I require a lot of help from my eyeliner/mascara to open the whole eye area. This mascara delivers!!!!!  The tips included with this product says to apply to tips first, since the base of lashes are naturally thicker. I would agree IF you have darker, thicker lashes. For those of us who have light lashes, ignore that tip! Start with the base as usual, and work it, work it, work it through- base to tip, base to tip, base to tip. Start with the part of your lashes you want to add the most definition to... if you're going out for the night, work the outer corners for a sexy look, then simply fill in the mid/inner lashes. If you're like me, just a work at home mom, start on the inner corner to really open the eye to cover how darn tired you are lol  Lastly, because BE uses good ingredients, there is nothing irritating about this mascara. It comes off easily, but I doesn't smear during the day. My eyes look as great at bedtime, when my hubby & I finally get *alone* time, as they do during the day taking care of my kids & working my brains off!!! SUCCESS!!!!!"

It doesn’t flake or smear, but unfortunately it didn’t do much for my lashes, either. The lengthening was OK, and it didn’t clump, but it didn’t give a thickening effect at all. Perhaps not enough mascara was deposited on the brush to make much difference for my lashes.

In fact when you first apply make sure to start at root of lashes and follow all the way through to ends which I know we all do anyways right... let the first couple of coats sit for a couple minutes then proceed with the next couple coats it works better for the fullness when you let it dry a little I love My Buxom Lashes!!!

The first is to fan out my lashes and the second to bulk them up. If I am going out or want to make my lashes look extra bold I apply a third coat.  The formula is also really nice, this isn't one of those flaky mascaras that make your lashes crunchy. When I wash my makeup off the mascara kind of melts away. This may sound scary because it may seem like it will smudge or transfer to the under eye area, but it totally stay put!  I have repurchased this mascara several times and always have a back up."

With drugstore mascaras approaching US$12, for a few bucks more, this mascara is definitely a good investment."

I have found a couple others that are good (second fave is Tartes lights, camera, lashes) but Buxom lasts longer than any other without getting thick, hard, or clumpy. The brush is by far the best, like none other. Lastly, the mascara spent need to be caked on to do the job, but can be built up to make the lashes look longer and more dramatic. My lashes have never been happier, fuller, and curlier than with Buxom lash. Highly recommended."

If you get this one anywhere close to your lashline, it colors your eyelid, no way going around it. BUT even when you do get it close to your lashline, it doesnt curl the lash what so ever! It's very rare that a mascara wouldn't curl (my) lash when you start at the base and work it up. It also does not make the lashes thicker. Only good thing is that it doesnt clump; but if a mascara is new it generally shouldnt anyway. Maybe if you use a lash curler and then only apply it to the tips of the lashes it would work? But why would I add a lash curler when I never have to with hundreds of other good mascaras? Either way, even if you did use a curler, it would still keep your lashes very thin and sad looking."

When I went to exchange for another mascara a Sephora associate suggested Lancôme and Buxom. I thought Lancôme was going to be it but Buxom out did Lancôme tenfold. I tried each mascara on and the difference between Buxom and Lancôme were so apparent. I have long but straight lashes and Buxom curled and defined my lashes without making them look like I have a ton of mascara on. You can layer as many coats as you want without clumping (I've layered up to 4 coats). My lashes look long, supple, healthy, and defined. The wand also separates lashes effortlessly. I had never heard of this mascara before it was suggested to me and I feel like this is a best kept secret or something. Great product and great price. I'm in love!"

Firstly, the brush is a bit too large for my liking which makes applying mascara kind of awkward. Secondly, I don't think it does that much for lengthing. It is loose in consistency and doesn't really voluminze or add depth to your lashes; it makes them look thin. Lastly but most importantly, it gets all over your eyelids when you apply! It is SO annoying! I wear white eyeshadow and then I get these black marks on my eyelids, even when I am trying to be careful. The mascara is quite black, I would like to add. I am a fair, blue eyed, red haired girl and it is almost too dark for me. I think this mascara is pretty average and I could easily compare its quality to an $8 mascara from the drug store."

I don't know if it's the big fat wand or the mascara itself but over and over I find Buxom to be my favorite. I naturally have pretty full lashes. When I use the Buxom mascara my lashes seem to double in length and thickness. I never get clumps and I don't have to bother with a lash curler or any other products. Two coats is more than sufficient (although it's best to apply the second coat immediately as it dries so quickly!). Therefore, I do two coats on one eye and then move to the other. The brush is perfect for my needs. I can get to the short lashes in the inner corners of my eyes as well as really stroke the outer corners into long, thick curves.I can even use the brush on my lower lashes without smudges or clumping of the lashes. With my Buxom mascara and Buxom lip plumping gloss (in Gaby) I'm good to go for the day. Oh yes, and the mascara washes off almost completely with soap and water. Surprisingly, it doesn't much smudge or flake during the day so it wears very well(surprising since I tend to rub my eyes inadvertantly quite a lot)"

This mascara worked great with my lashes. It did not clump at all, even when I put on a fourth coat of product. But you should know a few things about this mascara before purchasing, that I've learned to look when when shopping for mascara: 1. It's a wet formula. It's similar to Benefit's They're Real! Mascara. (if you don't the difference between wet and dry mascaras, a dry mascara example is either Benefit's BadGal Lash or Urban Decay's Big Fatty mascara. 2. It does not clump, even when you apply multiple coats. Either way, I love this mascara, and I will definitely repurchase Buxom Lash."

So I wanted something that would give me volume and this did not do it. It either grouped my lashes together that it looked like I had fewer lashes or since I have thin longer lashes already it made them look like spider long black spider legs. Which is not an attractive look. Really was hoping this would be my new go to mascara but sadly its not.

Buxom is MEGA lengthening, VERY GOOD volumizing, and EXCELLENT at defining lashes. My eyelashes are of average length and density, but they're very light as I am naturally blonde. This mascara--in just one coat, by the way--separates, lengthens, and makes my lashes pop to perfection. I haven't had to resort to a lash brush or to declump the mascara from the tube or on the wand -- it's simply perfect.  For the $19 price tag you really have your pick of premium Sephora mascaras. In my experience, this mascara is far better than its competition, and it is worth every penny. It also lasts a really long time (doesn't flake off), and each tube has enough goop in it to give you over a year of daily use (though technically, mascara has a 6 month shelf life).

It seems to have a lot of staying power, doesn't flake or smudge, and washes off fairly easily in the shower (could be a bit better in that department, but overall not bad). It really lengthens, defines, and volumizes my lashes. I think it's hard to find a brand/formula that does all three without making you look like you have spider lashes or clumping terribly. I get very few clumps with this mascara, if any, and when I do they are easily brushed out with a lash comb or removed with a q-tip. I do use a lash primer underneath this mascara to really bring out my lashes (I use Tarte's lash primer). I really like the thick brush as it coats every lash very well. It is just a tiny bit tricky to get the tinier lashes in the corners of my eyes, but with a little practice it's manageable."

But the result was long, full, dark, lush looking lashes! I love it, the brush is great and also is able to reach my bottom lashes and make them stand out as well.

It goes on effortlessly, it doesn't clump, it makes my lashes look luxuriously full without looking heavy or fake. And whatever is in this formula has improved the thickness and condition of my lashes, because evn on days I don't wear makeup my lashes look fuller and thicker than before. It's also long-wearing and doesn't smudge or flake, but removal is so easy with soap and water or makeup remover cloths. I am a contact lens wearer and this doesn't irritate my eyes.

Who wants to carry makeup remover around wtih them so they can clean up after it it? (not to mention the need to reapply concealer and the like... it's just too much trouble.)  2) It doesn't hold curl at all. I curl my lashes, apply, and the curl is gone almost immediately. The resulting look is lashes that stick straight out from my eyelids, which doesn't make my lashes look long and beautiful.  3) It is not volumizing. In fact when I apply it, my lashes group up into families so it looks like I have FEWER lashes than I aleady do; and I personally could use all the help I can get. Plus, it makes the lashes look like spider legs.  I wouldn't recommend this mascara. I've found better ones at the drug store."

I love the brush, I find that the synthetic rubber brushes apply much better. Also, I have no idea how it does it, but it makes your lashes extra long. It definitely is a lengthening mascara, over a thickening/volumizing one. This plays into the whole lack of clumping thing. If you are interested in more volumonous lashes, think PLLs girls lashes, you want a mascara that clumps and is targeted for volumizing. However, I personally love lengthening mascaras because it makes your lashes just seem naturally really long. I get comments all the time about how long my lashes are, they don't need to know that I am wearing mascara. ;) Overall I highly recommend anyone who is considering this mascara to just take the leap and get it, the price isn't bad considering how long it lasts and compared to other highend mascaras that do not preform anywhere near as well."

It is very defining, volumizing, and lengthening. It does not clump or flake. The brush makes it very easy to get all the way to the root of the lashes. I love, love, love it. Plus, I had been using Benefit's BadGal mascara for several years, and had resigned myself to a certain degree of smudge under my eyes because I have long lashes, top and bottom, to begin with. Well, Buxom fixed that problem. No smudges all day. I also wear contacts every day and have had no stinging, irritation or other contact-related problems I've had with other mascaras. Best of all - it's not stiff and doesn't make your lashes feel brittle. I'll be buying this again and again and again."

Very disappointing. I told the clek I wanted length and not as worried about volume. This mascara offers no length at all. Did plump lashes but they were still short. I prefer Tarte or Bare Escentuals mascara to this and quite frankly most mascara's to this one. Not a good value and not a good mascara. Also leaves black under eyes by end of the day. If you are looking for length, try elsewhere. Even cheap brands are better than this one."

It is easy to get mascara on your face or eyelids with a large brush.  When the mascara is new and fresh, the formula is thin and does not clump. It does give both length and volume. The formula does not work well on lower lashes because it will smudge and run underneath the eye. It is a very moist formula, and you must let this mascara dry. (I once sneezed right after applying this mascara, and it transferred under my eye. It was a mess!) This mascara works well for layering with other mascaras, and I like it as the base for that. I also like it over a lash primer.  The only problem that I really have with this mascara is that it always dries out too quickly. When it begins to dry out, the formula begins to clump and flake. It's just so difficult to work with when this happens. If you go through mascara very quickly, then maybe this won't be a problem for you."

The formula is a little drier than the black, so it's a little heavier on the lashes (I recurl after the dry and also mid-day), and it's harder to add some coats after it's already dry.

My lashes were BAM in your face, separated, super long and if I let them dry and put another coat on they had VOLUME. I was extremely excited and I now curl my lashes every day and use this mascara.  What this mascara is great for: Every day, separated, long and natural-looking lashes  What I would not but this mascara for: Extremely voluminous, dark and fake eyelash-looking lashes.

What I do like, are big, separated lashes that look like you were born with it; like movie-makeup mascara. Not all crazy clumpy and but not so natural that it looks like your normal lashes are just wet or something.  This mascara does it all for me, and the big brush just gets to every lash perfectly.  One coat for daytime at school and two coats when I want it more dramatic or at night."

I am telling you that I am very happy about my choice.  This mascara really separates my lashes and really makes the look fuller, and at first this didn't really WOW me because my Voluminous Million Lashes could do the same at a cheaper price. But what Buxom does and Voluminous didn't was that it didn't smear or run or anything! I mean sure, you can always buy the waterproof version of Voluminous Million Lashes but it's hard to take off. Buxom doesn't run and it isn't waterproof. I wore this in the pool (on accident) and it didn't budge. I was so surprised that I didn't have raccoon eyes.  I have this in both blackest black and blue noir. The blackest black is really good at defining your lashes, but blue noir really makes your eyes pop. It doesn't matter what color your eyes are. It just manages to makes your eyes pop and it's super pretty.  All-in-all, you should definitely buy this product. It is amazing and is my favorite mascara ever."

(BTW, something I have read - it seems most mascaras are made by 2 or 3 factories in Europe, so the mascara formulation isn't that different among all the various brands, but the brush - that's what makes different ones, well, different.)  I have the stereotypical thin-lash issue. They're long, but just not thick. So I prefer the plastic brushes and wetter formulas, because they separate my lashes better and the wetter formula doesn't clump them together so I don't end up with sparse, funky spider legs for lashes.  For those wanting a volumizing formula, this isn't really one of those (although the description says so) - you really have to layer it on to get it thicker, and even then it doesn't really get that thick. But that's what I love about it, because for my lashes, the thicker formula makes them look worse. It's just thick enough for me, without the clumpiness of a lot of volumizing formulas. The brush also has a slight dip in the middle, which is good. Oh, and the brush part is really long, longer than the ones I'm use to, and I think that is also a plus, because it covers so many lashes in one swoop.  I think this may be my favorite mascara yet! :-)"

After a few applications, I got the hang of it. I find that I have to curl my eyelashes, then apply once, allow it to dry for a minute or two, then immediately apply a second coat. Usually this gives me length and the curl stays. Stays on all day and comes off very easily with water.

So of course I bought the full size. I don't know why, but for some reason, the full size seems to dispense differently because I need to blot every time I use it, otherwise my lashes are more clumped and less fanned. It's still nice, it's just not quite right, and I'm very finicky with my mascara, as many days I don't wear anything but mascara or will just have mascara and blush or lips on. I think it's worth trying, so long as volume is one of the qualities your looking for. Personally, it's not balanced enough between voluminzing and defining.  By the way, I have naturally long lashes, so I don't need a ton of lengthening (but they all add some), though this does add some length.  So I'm still searching. I'd buy this again, but I'm still gonna try others and try to find that perfect one."

It also lengthens them quite well, and volumizes pretty decently.

It's brush is similar to the Diorshow Iconic brush. There are a few reasons I will be purchasing this from now on opposed to the Dior. 1. Less expensive 2. Washes off easier at the end of the day (I don't have to tug at my eyes which is important since I'm trying to keep wrinkles at bay for as long as possible) 3. Makes my lashes feel better. 4. It's very close to being completely natural  I would not choose this mascara if your eyes water a lot or you are planning on crying. Also, I would not use this mascara for pictures. It's pretty up close, but I find in pictures it doesn't give much drama to the eye. I would either wear falsies with it or layer another mascara on top."

I found that layering the mascara by applying less product with more strokes allows more control and separation for my lashes. I love how the formula goes on very black and smooth. I have no problems with clumping and the lack of additives is fabulous! My old mascara used to make my eyes itch from fragrances and other chemicals but I didn't realize that was the culprit until I swapped to this product. Overall, I'm a big fan of this mascara.

Not waterproof, if that's your thing. Definitely lengthens and defines. Not sure that it volumizes. I mean, it makes your lashes bigger, but I don't know about thicker. But really, how thick can eyelashes get without looking like you have some weird eye condition?  Bottom line, best mascara ever. Seriously. Buy it right now."

Then a couple weeks ago I purchased the Sephora Favorites set, which includes Buxom mascara. And I must say, this is THE MOST PERFECT MASCARA I have ever tried! No clumps, no raccoon eyes, no difficulty removing. One coat is beautiful and wonderful for daytime; it's noticeable without being too dramatic. But adding a second coat definitely adds the drama I'm looking for in the evening. And no matter how many coats I add this mascara refuses to clump, which is awesome. I am so incredibly pleased with Buxom, and I am so happy that I came across this mascara pretty much by accident! It's a winner in my book and will be a staple in my makeup bag for years to come."

It is not a very buildable formula but you can put as much as you want on and there still won't be any clumps. The only thing I do not like about this mascara however is the size of the brush. The hourglass shape is great but I think that the brush size itself is too big. I get mascara on my eye lids all the time because the brush is hard to control. All in all I would recomend others to try it because the formula is awesome and you can wear it all day without any smudges."

			"review_text": "* A quick description of my lashes: Average in length, but so straight and sparse that they look microscopic.  Breakdown of the mascara  - It lengthened my lashes nicely (no spidery effect); it wasn't a huge difference, but good enough.  - Very natural-looking volume if I apply only one or two coats. If I want a dramatic, false-lashes look, I would need at least three coats. The mascara was very buildable, and I didn't experience any clumping even after four coats.  - The brush did just what the description said in that it coats and thickens all the lashes evenly, including those hard-to-reach ones in the corners of the eyes. The formula is a true black color (no grayish tint at all).  - The definition was amazing. It gave my lashes a pretty, fluttery look, and they felt soft even after four coats.  - The formula was decent in holding a curl. It straightened out my lashes a little when I applied the first coat immediately after curling my lashes. But what was left of the curl stayed even after the second, third, and fourth coats, and the curl lasted all day.  - I didn't experience any flaking or smudging with this mascara for 12 hours.  - The mascara washed off pretty easily in the shower. I use Olay's Gentle Foaming Face Wash.  Overall, this is a near-perfect mascara for me. For the first time I actually look like I have eyelashes in photos, including the ones where I'm not standing very close to the camera. Highly recommend."

A couple of people have asked me if they are real. This formula does not clump upon application or flake off during the day. The number of coats one uses determines how long and lush they look. I usually use two coats for a striking effect. In my oppinion, this can only be made better by making it in waterproof, although it does not come off quickly if you happen to shed a tear. So I continue to order it again and again."

Everything I want in a mascara I get with Buxom, and then some. I want beautifully long, voluminous lashes that don't look cakey at all--very hard to find! This mascara coats my lashes evenly and lengthens with one coat, and with a second coat, I get the volume I'm looking for. It never looks cakey! And for those reviews that talk about the lack of volume: you really need two coats at least to get the full effect. One coat won't cut it. An added bonus is the mascara's longevity. I've been using the same tube everyday for a month and it hasn't caked up or dried out AT ALL. Every swipe is like a fresh bottle. What a money saver! I can't recommend this mascara more.

I naturally have long eye lashes so when I don't use a waterproof mascara some tend to bring my eye lashes down and this is one product that by the end of a long day it doesn't look so good.

I used this for the first time and found that it defined and curled my lashes really well without clumping. I think the secret is partially because of the shape of the brush....it is shaped in a hourglass and it seems to get even the skinniest of my lashes. The other part would be because BE just rocks it out and Leslie has an amazing product line.

I'm a mascara junkie- I love eyelashes- and using Buxum, I regularly sport the best lashes I ever have. I'm half Chinese and half caucasian, but thankfully I got my mother's eyes- larger than your regular asian eye, with long eyelashes. However, because of the Chinese, my lashes tend to be straight, and not as thick as some others'. Using Buxom, not only do they look ridiculously long, they also look incredibly thick!  My one quibble with Buxom is how wet the formula is. This quality has both pros and cons. Because it takes so long to dry, it's realllly hard to ever get clumps in my lashes, which means you can pretty much put on as many coats as you like without the fear of looking like there's spider legs poking out of your eyeballs. On the other hand, after I finish applying the mascara, I have to super careful for the next hour or so to avoid touching my eyes or brushing against my lashes, as they'll stick together. What I've found works the best is applying one coat, letting it dry for 10 or 15 minutes, then applying two more coats at that time. The dry first coat allows the next two coats to stick much better, making the process faster and allowing me to use less mascara to get my desired look.  Another GREAT thing about Buxom is the brush- the rubbery wand grips and coats every single lash, allowing for fantastic definition. Because the bristles are so small, I can get even the tiny lashes on the inside of my eye, as well as the ones at the corners that are harder to get at. The brush works fantastically, it even curls my lashes. I don't even need to use an eyelash curler if I don't want to!  I love Buxom lash!"

			"review_text": "Last year, I created a very specific look for a party, wearing mostly blues and silvers, and choosing my makeup in the same tones. I had completely forgotten about it until a friend reminded me recently how good it had looked. I was able to recreate the same look again, wearing clothes in silvers and blues, and then matching with my eye makeup. I was able to create a somewhat dramatic glamorous look. My skin is very pale, so I used that to my benefit, omitting the tinted moisturizers or tinted primers I usually use. I opted not to use blush. Like last year, I used Buxom Lash Mascara Blue Noir on my lash tips, It worked well over the other mascara.. I used a blue liner, rich intense silver shadow (DIOR 1-Colour Ultra-Smoothing High Impact Eyeshadow in Chrome), black mascara, and then this Buxom Lash Mascara Blue Noir on the tips. When I did this last year, it was quickly apparent that the Blue Noir was the extra touch needed to make the look have some oomph because it was sort of bland until I added the blue. What's interesting is that, while the blue isn't terribly obvious when it goes on over black (plus I have black lashes), it adds a really nice finishing touch and definitely some drama. I can't define exactly what happens, but it really makes a difference. I could see this after adding the Blue Noir to the first eye, and then comparing it to the eye I hadn't applied the Blue Noir. The reminds me sort of a Cleopatra look, but done with a much lighter hand, as compared to the heavy blacks (liner,lashes, shadow) that are shown in Cleopatra movies. It might be a good idea for a Halloween costume, too, although that's thinking ahead."

It does not hold curl at all, but my lashes are super-straight and no mascara ever managed to hold a curl on me. So don't mind that. The only thing is that it smudges at little bit, but just a quick swipe of a wet finger under the eye takes it off. I realised though that it will never smudge if I don't put any mascara on my bottom lashes. So I use a waterproof mascara (Diorshow Iconic Extreme for now) and my eyes are beautiful and perfect. I have tried lots of mascara, and this is one of the best quality for the price I have ever found, and it lasts a very long time without drying. I have had it for at least 3 months and the results are the same as the first time I tried it."

It adds volume to make my lashes look fuller and adds even length and definition while keeping them separated. This mascara is especially perfect for those of us who aren't blessed with naturally long lashes as it helps to define the lashes to create a full and complete lashline. This lasts all day without smudging or flaking and is also great for any occasion, even if you're going for an everyday natural look for work. This adds a hint of wow factor to my everyday look.

It was the only mascara I would use but I decided to try a new one out of curiosity. I am a lover of good mascaras and am obsessed with finding the best one. A saleswoman at sephora recommended I would like Buxom if I am looking for a new one and love diorshow iconic. I have to say after using this mascara a few times I have fallen in love. It thickens, lengthens and separates. It may definitely be my new favorite mascara. Although I still recommend using a primer before hand. I recommend the diorshow primer."

This works great to get all those tiny little corner lashes. I then go back and add one more coat. Believe it or not, no clumps. None. The black is rich and dark and makes my lashes look really nice.

It was that intense love and loyalty that drove me to Buxom Lash. Unfortunately, Buxom Lash just didn't live up to the high standard that the big & healthy lipsticks had built.  The Buxom Lash is the clumpiest mascara I've ever owned. I get clumps of the actual mascara on my lashes on top of it fusing my lashes together in odd little groups. The formula dried quickly which would be lovely if I wasn't trying to comb out the clumpy mess this creates. On the odd occasion the mascara goes on without unfortunate congregation of lashes ensuing it's gorgeous. My lashes are thicker, longer and not nearly as stiff as they are with cheaper pharmacy type cosmetic brands. The problem is that the mascara rarely goes on that well. I still try it out of a vain hope sometimes (because I've still got it thanks to holding out hope past the date I could return it by) but overall Buxom has let me down this time, which is a shame."

I've tried the pink tubes, and the black tubes, and the purple tubes, and the gold tubes . . . nothing, at all, has come close to this formula. Every time I put this mascara on, it's like I'm wearing false lashes. Something about the brush just picks up your lashes, sweeps them away, and manages to coat every single one without making them look clumpy. WITHOUT A PRIMER, mind you. I used to be bent on mascaras with primer, so I could get the fullest lashes possible. Never again will I ever by any other mascara. LOVE IT. <3"

No funny smell, great brush thats big but can use the end to get in the corners. Its not waterproof, but i would say almost water resistant. Didnt smuge walking in rain, humid weather, or at the gym, though it is a bit tough to get off at night and definately need a eye make-up remover. Its up there in price for a macara though the longivity of this product and look it gives were worth it to me. My next favorite masara was Laura mercier though too expensive, love maybline one by one minus the funny smell and it smuges a bit. I found Benifit bad gal smuges a bunch and like this one much better. Overall one of the BEST ive ever tried!"

I think I like the brush other than the fact it was a bit sharp at the edges and hurt a bit, : it was a fantastic shape and size. The formula is very wet and weak. Color intensity is good (it's a nice true black), but ZERO bang for your buck. This volumizing mascara has NO VOLUME. I also found that by the end of a day it has disappeared from my lashes....it didn't flake off, it didn't smear off, it just sort of was barely there by midnight. Weird. So, I'm sad to say, this is not earning a place on my shopping list. :("

			"review_text": "I had used Benefit BadGal Lash (which I still love, to be fair) for a few years now, so I decided to switch it up and try something new. I settled on this mascara, since it seemed like it had the volumizing properties plus the deep black I like.  At first I was really really disappointed in the product. The first couple of uses were terrible (even more than the first few days with other mascaras); runny lashes, spider lashes, you name it -- all very unappealing.  But, about a week in the product started working much better for me, and I have to say it does a really incredible job of making my lashes look naturally gorgeous. It definitely lengthens and volumizing, but without clumping at all or having obvious signs of heavy mascara.  You *definitely* have to change up how you apply it, though. Don't wiggle the wand back and forth, just sweep up straight. Also, curl your lashes beforehand because the wand won't help in that department.  This mascara lasts me throughout a 10 hour work day + gym session. It almost even lasts throughout an hour long boxing session, which is very impressive! I highly recommend if you want defined but not OTT lashes that look fuller and longer."

The wand was what attracted me to it, and it applies the mascara perfectly. I also love it because I can make my left eyelashes fuller by applying two or three coats, and I only have to apply one coat to my right eyelashes to even them out (for some reason they're thinner and more brittle on my left eye), so it looks even, full, and incredible! It also leaves my eyelashes feeling normal after I take it off; they don't feel brittle or itchy. :) I definitely recommend this to everybody! My only concern is that it doesn't come in the color that I want, which is brown... So I ordered some Flawless Definition in brown, and I'm just going to reuse the wand from Buxom for when I need a day time look. :p"

Plus, it doesn't have harmful chemicals. This is my new favorite mascara. I feel like many reviewers are a little prejudiced towards a brand name, but this one is better than most.

Compared to the Bad Girl mascara which is great at volumizing, this one is a great lengthener. Also, the formula seemed more watery, not as thick as others.

Although it doesn't do so great at volumizing, it does an exemplary job of lengthening and defining with not a clump in sight. It holds the curl in my lashes well and doesn't flop after a few hours. The end results are very pretty. It absolutely beats the snot out of Benefit's Bad Gal, which I presume is one of its direct competitors. Buxom's effects are extremely similar to Diorshow Iconic; I would highly recommend this product as a more economical alternative.  Some negatives... It does not have perfect staying power. I notice black starting to build up under my eyes (note that I do not apply to the bottom lashes) after as little as 8 hours, but other times as long as 12. The brush is extremely large and can be cumbersome. At the end of the day, it's also more difficult to remove than the average mascara.  Overall, for its price range, this is an excellent mascara. While I think I still prefer Sephora's Atomic Volume and MUFE's Smoky Lash for their volume and durability, if you're looking for a moderately priced mascara that gives gorgeous length and definition, this is where you'll find it."

All it takes is an eyelash curler, two coats of Buxom, and I'm good to go. Not only does this mascara hold a curl really well, despite not being waterproof, but it also separates and defines lashes, coating each lash, with the result that my lashes seem longer, thicker, and less sparse. Don't attempt more than two or three coats, though. It will clump and weigh down your lashes. Trust me. You don't want weeping willow lashes."

I've tried Dior Show (which was just 'eh' for me) and Lancome Definicils (which I liked a lot) as well as a bunch of other mascaras over the years, but Buxom Lash is the only one that really makes my almost non-existent lashes pop!  I wish I could rate it 4.5 stars instead of 4. The half point off would be because it isn't waterproof. I wish Buxom made a waterproof version of this..."

However, the applicator is rather large and I have difficulty applying this without smudging it on my eyelids.  Applying the mascara carefully and patiently solves this problem :]."
