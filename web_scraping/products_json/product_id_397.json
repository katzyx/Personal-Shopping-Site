I am on a regimen of Tretinoin, spironolactone, and topical anti biotics.   Adding this mask has made a significant difference in a relatively short amount of time. I have been using this for about 3 weeks. it's helped reduce the healing time of breakouts and reduced the amount I get overall. if you read the studies, this device is BEST when used WITH a solid skincare routine and mostly when your skin is being exfoliated (i.e. tret/peels). I think this alone it's not going to be as affective but it has definitely boosted my results from my dermatologist Rx products.   further, you can get this with an FSA/HSA account."

            "review_text": "I bought this years ago after being given a free blue light device to trial from another brand that massively helped my cystic acne and reading studies about the benefits of light therapy. That trial device only spot treated so it took me forever to treat all the areas that needed it. So after it died, I wanted to get something that would treat my whole face. I first got a light panel, but a treatment took like 30 minutes and you had to sit in one spot just staring at the light device the whole time while making sure not to get too far away from it, which was uncomfortable. You were also supposed to do treatments multiple times a day. It was a huge time suck and I didn't notice any effects. Plus it was huge and difficult to store. So I researched more and found this device which was newer on the market and had the right wavelengths for both treating acne and rosacea, which were my primary concerns. The red light wavelengths seemed to be the right ones too, so I was sold despite the high price since I figured I'd return it if it didn't work. It works really well for both my acne (including cystic acne) and rosacea!! I do need to use it daily to see the best results, but since the treatment time is so short that's easy to do. The strap to keep it on seriously sucks, but I see they've updated that so hopefully it's better now. I just use it while laying down. I also don't trust that it's safe to use with my eyes opened due to how bright it is so I just keep my eyes closed. I can't say how helpful the anti-aging benefits are though since people already thought I was much younger than I am. I will say it doesn't seem to be built the greatest as sometimes the button takes a few presses before it works and the construction seems cheap. Though it's still working, so I guess I can't complain too much. I do wish however that it fit my face a bit better. Overall, it's worth the high price for me since it provides such major benefits and relief."

            "review_text": "Do yourself a favor and invest in a different brand. This was my first experience with a red light therapy product and I am not a fan.   I bought this item in hopes that its blue light feature would be the answer for my adult acne, while also hopefully seeing some benefit from the red lights. First, the mask doesn't even come with a proper protective case...just a little drawstring bag. For the price, you can't even safely travel with this product. Even the dyson airwrap (another luxury tool) has a proper hardshell case. Second, the strap on this is laughable. It does not stay secure for me, and the mask itself has some weight to it. Because of its heaviness and nonsecure strap, it is always sliding down my face, meaning I have to lay down the whole time. Third, my derm told me that 3 minutes is not enough time to see real benefit and told me that 10 minutes is more ideal for any type of red light therapy. She is a doctor, I am not, so I am inclined to believe her. Because of me having to sit with it on for 3 cycles (9 minutes), the battery dies so quickly.   All of that to say, I am disappointed with the lack of attention to detail and wish I could return the product for a refund. I won't speak to the effectiveness because I have since upped my acne medication regimen and believe that this is the reason for any improvement in my skin (I now use this mask about 3x per week and have had it since April), but the lack of attention to detail for such a pricey product is enough for me.   Also, like some other reviews have mentioned, I am concerned about the effect of the lights on my eyes. To be safe, you should probably keep your eyes closed while wearing this."

The results are minimal and the cost of this mask is high. Depending on what youu2019re targeting and the results that youu2019re hoping for, this is most likely not worth the investment. - Blue lights stopped working about 12 months later on my device.  - This is a massive waste of plastic and electrical pieces once you can no longer use it. They should introduce a recycling program for this or something. I feel terrible throwing it away now that itu2019s no longer workingu2026   Pros: - Easy to use at home - Comes with both red and blue light treatment in one unit - Looks coolu2026?  Overall, I found other light therapy options more effective than this one. For me, the blue light in this device was more effective at reducing acne and treating acne marks than the red light was at reducing wrinkles.  For about 5 months, I was using this 2 - 3 x week. During each treatment session, I did one red light round and one blue light round."

My dermatologist removed it but it came back in a month. Within a week of using this device it is nearly completely gone. I didn't even think this was possible. Overall, my pores are smaller and less apparent.   I typically use this at night and follow it with the DDG peptide product. Then in the AM, after washing my face, I use the gentle peel. It may be the combo of these products working for me. I am really impressed."

I do want to mention the reason I rate this 4 instead of 5 stars and its simply because of one reason and that is that it is too heavy for the silicone straps to hold up against your hair. It slides everytime I even try to put this on even if i tighten it up the best way i can, it eventually slips so I had to take them off and just use it without them laying down. Other than that, I did get this using my 20% discount for being rouge. it is an expensive product but it does work!"

I just tighten it up about once a week. My friends are getting face lifts and are astonished that I do not need one. This is a marvelous beauty device. I must say that I've had covid several times and it has affected my skin by drying it out severely. If I had not been using this mask, I would have looked much older than I am. Most people assume I'm in my late 40's to early 50's. I highly recommend this device. I have also invested in the Body, Mouth, and Eye LED items as well. I'm reviewing the Faceware Pro because I've used it the longest. They all work, though.

BUT if I can spend in the region of this on botox annually, then I figured what's the harm in investing in something that could cut down on the bill and (hopefully) save money in the long run? It has 2 main functions, to combat acne/breakout prone skin and also aid in the anti-ageing process. I purchased it for the latter, and was curious to see if it improved my overall skin texture and elasticity.  The results? My skin definitely looks more radiant and uniform looking. I feel that it has done something to my fine lines too as they seem ever so slightly less visible. My skin looks and feels good and for the price you pay for this contraption, it definitely should! The only con I had with the mask was with the elastic strap that tightens it in place. After only 3 sessions, it started to lose its grip, meaning I had to hold the mask in place. I absolutely loved trying this mask, but I just cannot get my head around the price. After a months' usage, though I'm loving the other results, I'm not convinced it's the immediate answer to botox. The elevens' are still there, the crows feet still visible when I smile. Muscle movements, are something it doesn't seem to work on, which is confusing as the description mentions targeting wrinkles (which are caused by muscle movements!).

When I received this product my expectations were high because I had read excellent reviews. But I must confess that none of them seem to me to be as close to reality as my own experience. I am amazed at how easy this mascara works and how effective it is. I have used it for 30 consecutive days. Every night after my usual double cleansing to remove makeup, sunscreen and impurities. With dry skin, I proceed to use the mask, I use the first red light option for 2 minutes (the mask turns off automatically when the time is complete) I wait 4 or 5 minutes and apply my night skincare products normally. The results speak for themselves in the photo (without any filter). And I am very happy to list them: 1. It has helped me with the production of collagen in a rapid and very noticeable way (even my eyebrows look fuller, which is why I think the LED light regenerates the skin, it has also done so with the hair follicles, the change is very noticeable and since I have not used any specific product for the eyebrows. I consider that it is a result of the mask) 2. The dark spots that I have been struggling with for a long time (next to my jaw and under my eye) practically disappeared. In person they are visible, but very slightly. 3. My deep frown line has decreased noticeably, especially the part closest to my forehead. 4. My pores look smaller. 5. Skin care products are absorbed faster and you feel them working (it's an indescribable feeling, but believe me you feel it) 6. And last but not least (in fact it is what my family and friends have noticed the most) my skin without makeup has a healthy glow and feels firmer and very moisturized. I'm so happy with this mask, I clean it with a dry towel after using it and it is my most precious treasure. I want it to last a lifetime."

The device is lightweight, making it easy to use for extended periods without any discomfort. The LED lights are evenly distributed, providing consistent coverage across my entire face. The LED technology used in this device is impressive. It combines red and blue lights, which are known for their acne-fighting and anti-aging properties. The red light stimulates collagen production, reducing the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles. Additionally, it helps to even out my skin tone and improve overall texture. The blue light targets acne-causing bacteria, effectively reducing breakouts and preventing future ones. Using the FaceWare Pro is incredibly simple. It has an automatic shut-off feature after three minutes, ensuring that I don't overuse it. I appreciate this feature as it saves me from constantly checking the time. The device also has a built-in timer that beeps every minute, allowing me to move on to different areas of my face. I have been using the FaceWare Pro for a few weeks now, and I have noticed a significant improvement in my skin. FaceWare Pro is an investment. It is on the pricier side compared to other at-home LED devices. However, considering the results I have seen so far, I believe it is worth every penny. The device is also rechargeable, eliminating the need for constant battery replacements. Overall, I highly recommend the Dr. Dennis Gross FaceWare Pro - LED Acne/Anti-Aging Device to anyone looking for an effective and convenient solution to combat acne and signs of aging."

I guess the more concerning part of all of this is that I developed brown spots on my upper cheekbones where my skin and the mask had the closest content (one big pigmented spot on each cheek).

The strap that they use for the mask is a thin, cheap piece of plastic, that they have in a pretty gold color. The strap never stays in place, constantly loosens itself when you try to put it on, or just completely comes apart and you have to assemble it all over again.   I'm definitely unimpressed by this product. The strap itself ruins the product for me as I'm spending a half hour just trying to put the mask on for a 3 minute cycle.  There are better products out there that can give the same result, cost about the same (or less), but way less hassle. Which is the route I have taken. Seriously, move on from this product."

The silicone strap isn't the easiest to adjust, but it's really not that bad.  There are a lot of comments stating there is no warranty. There *is* a warranty on the product. It must be registered within 30 days of purchase to qualify for the one year limited warranty. Registration steps are in the instruction manual.

I purchase this mask about one month ago and canu2019t believe the results. My hyperpigmentation is fading rapidly, my face looks plumped and has a young glow. I have not had problems with the straps, not sure if the company has corrected the issue. I do wear it for 20 minutes, everyday. I know itu2019s an expensive device but I canu2019t recommend it enough. I used Klarna to help break up the cost, all without any additional interest.

Also, even though I take great care and clean my mask as per the instructions, the plastic inside the mask covering the little lights is turning brownish (seems to be related to the heat produced by the lights) so this is also disappointing for such an expensive product and I wonder if it affects the quality of the treatment.

I became a licensed esthetician and learned a lot more about light. Any light that is powerful enough to make an impact in 3 minutes might be so powerful that it might have some risks too. Something to consider. I upgraded to a pro device from another brand not sold at Sephora. Itu2019s also sold at a retail cost for about $1800, and I paid $1200 for it with a pro discount. It  runs for 30 minute cycles (less powerful lights are safer for longer periods) and it came with eye protection. Something to think about. If you use this mask, cover your eyes. Protect them."

I tried returning it after giving it 4 weeks and just missed the return window (I thought it was an extended holiday return window because this was purchased in early November, plus there was a shipping delay that ate into the 30 day window).  Any skincare routine requires at least 4 weeks for improvement and I am disappointed by the return policy as explained to me in store and online. I had modest expectations for this to work, understanding nothing works overnight but I  am over $500 poorer and my skin looks the same. Don't waste your money. I would rate this zero if that were an option as it those are the results."

All of these features have made it easier for me to incorporate the face mask into my daily routine, otherwise I do not think I would spend this money on a device that I would be less inclined to use on a daily basis. I know people have complained in here about the strap.. I personally have not had to many issues with it, I do need to tighten it maybe every few times I wear it, kind of like swim goggles but I donu2019t mind. There has been a couple times that it has come loose while I have been wearing it but I was able to fix it easily, and the mask grips my face so much on its own I donu2019t think it would ever fall to the floor. I have noticed that my strap does look different then other reviews that I have watched so I think that they have updated it to be better? I included a picture of what my strap looks like. I am happy with the charging capacity of my mask and all of the bulbs are still in mint condition after 6 months of daily use, I think I will get many more years out of this product. I think it is the perfect addition to my preventative aging skin care routine. :)"

After COVID, 4-5 HUGE PAINFUL cystic acne bumps per WEEK.   I was MISERABLE.   I was just about to restart a prescription medicine from  my dermatologist that literally jacked up entire body the  previous time I had been on  it. I was desperate.  Then I was up doing some late night shopping and ordered this.  I dedicated myself  to using it every single day.   Within two weeks the bumps were no longer forming and the previous scars were healing more quickly than normal. I thought maybe just a coincidence, but of course kept at it .  I can now honestly say that after 5 months, I get maybe one bump a month...and itu2019s not nearly as severe as before and heals up much more quickly. Also my hyperpigmentation has lightened.  I never skip a day for fear.  Itu2019s a commitment not a quick fix. Iu2019m ok with that. 6 minutes of my day is easy and doable.  I do not use the straps. They are awful and Iu2019m afraid of my mask falling off and  breaking. So I just hold it on my face. Doesnu2019t bother me at all.  If you are suffering from acne TRY THIS.  I want to get a backup in case anything ever happens to mine. I charge it overnight every 3-4 days just to make sure itu2019s always ready.  Thatu2019s all! 1000000 stars if I could!"

I will need more time to see if does any anti-aging but my boyfriend says yes.  The only reason I will take away a star is that for an expensive beauty product, the strap to put it on your face is terrible. It's a silicone material and very slippery so really hard to keep the strap through the loops. If you make it too tight, it pulls on your hair when taking it off or unravels. It's also not easy to pull it through the loops when the mask in on your face. I wish they had done a different material or different mechanism for the strap. I think the easiest way to use it is to forgo the straps altogether and just rest on your face laying down."

I had also tried professional salon peels (Green Peel), but they were too harsh on my skin.   This mask has done it for me. It has reduced redness and significantly helped with breakouts (rosacea breakouts). Expensive, but so worth it.  If you do get it, make sure to register it on the Dr. Dennis website for the extended 1 year warranty."

The strap is flimsy, it's better to use this lying down because if you use the strap stand up (or if your cheek bone can hold on to the device) the device will drag down on your skin. For the price this is not worth it. Could have used more material lights and wider mask.  Going to replace with another brand when this eventually dies.

The treatment misses the lower cheeks and jawline. For this price they should have added a little more plastic and a few more LED bulbs.

I didnu2019t want to go straight back to the dermatologist because accutane is extremely tough on the body and I was willing to try anything else.  I bought this with fairly low expectations, but i actually see results! I use the mixed setting that had both the blue and red lights to tackle acne and anti-aging. I see my fine lines are reduced and my acne is really under control. If I have a zit, pretty much the next day after using this mask itu2019s gone.  The only negative is that it may not cover your face fully. It also worries me regarding lack of eye protection, but I use tanning goggles when I wear the mask.

So I went ahead and searched online for any additional information and didn't have any luck. The next thing I did was contact the manufacturer by sending a message through their chat, along with an email. It has been over a week since I contacted Dr. Dennis Gross, and all I've received is coupons and spam emails. Due to their lack of diligence, along with the other reviews I've read on Sephora, I decided to return the mask. It's not worth it to jeopardize the effectiveness of my botox treatments if that alone is already working out for me, and if I don't suffer from acne."

It neutralizes pimples as soon as they appear and I can get rid of them in less than week. Before it will take more than a week and it will leave a horrible scar. I use the red and blue light in the morning and the blue itself at night to get the most of it. Itu2019s travel friendly and the battery last a week with 2 daily uses. The straps in the back donu2019t hold the mask too tight but I just lay down for 3 minute."

My skin is smoother and my acne scars have lightened, which says a lot because I have naturally tan skin with hyper-pigmentation. When I started using this mask, I had two cystic volcanos, one on my nose and one near my eyebrow. Both since healed and normally it takes a full week or more for both the zit and dark spot to fade from my skin. I used both the blue light and red light in unison. I was initially very skeptical. It sounded too good to be true. I always thought my acne was from stress or birth control hormones. I've bought the PMD, Clarisonic, acid peels, Retin-A, facial essences promising to get rid of acne, and I use foundation with Vitamin C and turmeric and those all have helped to some degree but they can be harsh on the skin. So far this has been the most effective tool delivering the fastest results which leads me to believe that bacteria must be my main issue since the blue light that kills acne-causing bacteria seems to be working. I do have a bad habit of touching my face a lot throughout the day and I have oily skin that probably traps the bacteria. One thing I'm curious about is whether this is safe for my eyes. It's probably safe if its FDA-approved but I might try to find some tanning bed goggles on Amazon anyway."

This mask is also cheaper than the ones from other reputable retailers like Shani Darden ($1,900) and LG ($589). I for sure won't put an alibaba mask that costs 30 on my face that is not backed up by the FDA or a doctor.   The only thing I did not like was the strap. It is absolutely pointless and cheap.

After emptying acne products after acne products to no avail (drug store and high end) I decided to finally make the purchase since I had this in my cart for so long. I was able to get it when Sephora had the discount promotion. Luckily I kept an eye on it every day because it was sold out right be the deal started and was finally back in stock a day before the promotion ended. Within 1 hour it was sold out again. Even without the promotion this thing keeps selling out! So I'm surprised there are barely any reviews. Anyways this is worth the money! Yes it is pricey but let me just say it is worth it mostly if you're like me and are constantly buying skincare products to treat stubborn acne that won't go away. With this one time purchase I don't plan on repurchasing any of my older skincare products which more than likely totaled over the price of this. The first time I used this I was skeptical like what can this even do? its just lights. I woke up the next day and my stubborn acne on my chin was dramatically reduced! I started to use this in the morning and night its day 4 now and all I have left is one tiny pimple on my chin, it's also reducing the pigments in older acne scars. Also as a plus it has reduced my fine lines on my forehead."

It definitely helps control any irritated spots or slight acne I get."

I was so hopeful of it helping out with my acne and have used religiously everyday and moved to twice a day after a month of not really seeing any change. I wish I had better news but I have not seen improvement. Even a little improvement would have been enough to keep me excited but nothing. I spoke with someone directly with Dr. Dennis Grossu2019 customer service since all the other reviews on any site were near perfect and this is not a cheap item. I wasnu2019t offered much in the way of help other than u201cin some cases it begins to help in a few daysu201d which obviously doesnu2019t help me. Just very disappointed and out $435."

While that item is great for spot treatment, if you have generally nice skin save a monthly pimple, it is a hassle for full face/ multiple spots. My concern is acne and scarring but now as I enter my thirties, wrinkles as well. This provides both treatments at the same time. So easy and quick to use each day and I find it has been immensely effective. I will say that my one critique is that the shape is kind of awkward on my face shape (it feels a bit off) but that doesnu2019t effect its ability to treat. Really worth the investment."

            "review_text": "I am 46 years old and a skincare junkie of about 20 years.  When it comes to spending $450 on a LED light mask for your face, I suggest you already be on board and have an understanding of LED benefits to your skin (ie what different light colors are designed to do, their depths they go versus laser treatments you might get at an actual dermatologist office, etc). There are a lot of LED options out there.  Over the years, what is really different as these have caught on with the general public is the amount of surface area of the skin on your face these at home treatment tools cover and the length of time needed to use them on a daily basis. My first hand held tool was about the size of dime and took me out 20 minutes to administer (because again, the surface area of the tool was small).    I have used a few different LED hand held tools over the years to get a larger surface area and thus cut down time.  I am only really interested in the red light due to my age.  I was excited about this Spectralife because the amount of surface area is no longer an issue with this mask, because it administers light to my entire face in 3 minutes.  With hand tools, my arm gets tired, because you are pressing the mechanism into your skin and moving it around.  With Spectralite, I make sure it is charged, have a clean face with nothing on it (I use it after my Refa tool and before essence), I put it on my face, press the button, lay down and chill for 3 minutes and I am done.  So maximum surface area is covered and it requires no work on my end.  Love it!   I use a mild alcohol wipe to clean it off once a week and store it in its pouch.  I use it once a day.  I have had it for about 30 days and have only charged it once, so it lasts a long time, maybe less if you are using it twice a day.   Is it working?  One never knows what is working if you have fine tuned a research driven skincare routine.  But I am a believer of LED light and I find this an excellent and super easy tool"

Evenly distributes the correct amount of light therapy all over your face in very little downtime! I was looking between this and the Skin Inc. but I am so happy I went with this one! I am able to combine red and blue light in three minutes all over my face versus rubbing the skin inc device taking turns with the light between 10 mins (chances of uneven distribution on the face). Does not require a water-based mask prior to use, just make sure your skin is clean and dry. Very high-quality material and rechargeable USB cable. The skin inc. requires batteries to operate.
