The cream and orange color scheme gives it a fresh yet sophisticated look. I applied a small amount (roughly the size of two peas) throughout the mid-lengths and ends of my damp locks. Be careful not to use too much, or else your hair will feel sticky and stiff. Although the product is white in color , it turns invisible on application. The consistency is like a lotion but feels weightless on hair. The scent can be off-putting to some, as the fragrance is reminiscent of that of a sunscreen.  Once I combed the product through, I used a blow dryer to style my tresses. The result? Instantly softer hair! The leave-in treatment left my hair smoother, shinier, and untangledu2026 a state it hasnu2019t been in for over 3 months! Surprisingly, the product also helped diminish the frizz I had resigned myself to.  Iu2019ve been using this baby consistently for the past 2 weeks, and Iu2019ve never been happier with my hair! Since it is a heat protectant as well, my mane has stayed healthy despite several run-ins with a flat iron. If you are looking to transform your dehydrated locks, then this is definitely the product for you!"

This has a very light scent. It tends to leave my hair feeling drier than normal. During and after styling I feel like my hair is not as soft as it is normally. If you have more oily hail, this would probably be a great product, but just not for me."

And this is what I think: Upon my first use, I was unimpressed. While my hair was wet it felt drier than before with other brands. The instructions on the label tell you to use the amount of two drops. Two drops?? What does that mean? It's a cream, so is that a pea-sized amount? Drops the size of a dime?? However, after figuring out the right amount for my hair (turned out to be a nickel sized blob) and combining with other products in the line (shampoo and condtioner) and drying, I was very happy with the result! My hair was smooth and soft and remained that way for a few days (I do not wash my hair every day). I think this is a great product--I did not have any problems with my fine hair being weighed down or being dried out. The only thing I don't like is the vagueness of the amount to be used, how hard it is to find English on the label, and price point when I will want to purchase it in the future :)"

I knew it could potentially tame my curls, especially when I straighten my hair. Typically when I straighten my hair, by the second or third day it starts to frizz out, so I was excited to put this product to the test. And let me tell you, it exceeded my expectations because of the difference it made on my hair  After using it to straighten my hair, my hair was silky smooth and pin straight. This product is so good my hair lasted a week and half where  I typically have to wash my hair out by day 5 due to the frizz. However, It stayed sleek and frizz-free. I can not rave enough about heat protection though. After washing my hair, I noticed no heat damage, which was shocking to me  considering my past experiences with heat protectants. I always experienced some sort of heat damage. My friends even told me that they didnu2019t see any heat damage in my hair, which was surprising to hear that they noticed. This made me so happy because they know how much I love my curls and the amount of damage I usually get when straightening it. Overall, as you can see I loveee this product and I would repurchase it. I just want to mention that this product was sent to me for free, but I am giving honest and genuine review based on my experience."

So, Iu2019ve been using the Kerastase Nutritive Nectar Thermique for a little while now, and let me tell you, itu2019s been a pretty fab addition to my hair routine. First things first, that scent u2013 itu2019s like a bouquet of flowers decided to have a party in my bathroom. Now, if youu2019re into fragrances, you might just fall head over heels for it. But fair warning, itu2019s definitely not subtle. If youu2019re sensitive to strong smells, proceed with caution. Now, performance-wise, this stuff is legit. Itu2019s like a silky hug for your hair. My strands feel smoother, and Iu2019ve noticed less frizz u2013 especially when Iu2019m blow-drying or straightening. Plus, it doesnu2019t weigh my hair down, which is a major win. But hereu2019s the tea: itu2019s a bit of a splurge. Yeah, itu2019s not exactly budget-friendly, but sometimes you gotta treat yourself, right? A little goes a long way, though, so that tube lasts longer than a Netflix binge. Would I recommend it? Totally! If youu2019re cool with the scent and want to invest in healthier locks, give it a whirl. Just sniff before you commit u2013 you know, in case the floral fiesta isnu2019t your jam. Hope this helps someone out there on their hair journey!"

I have thin/fine hair and an oily scalp. This very quickly made my hair look and feel weighed down although I used a minimal amount. -The price is a bit high in my opinion but if it worked perfectly for my hair, then I might have had a different opinion on the price  Overall I still believe Kerastase is a good brand and would recommend this to a friend whose hair type it is intended for."

It felt hydrated and smooth. I was worried that the next day my hair wouldnu2019t hold curl, but it was the opposite. I curled my hair the next day and it held all day so no worries about making your hair too soft or slick to style.
