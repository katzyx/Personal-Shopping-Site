My best use is detangling or using it before I heat style my hair. That way, it smells good and I have enough leave-in conditioner. Otherwise, can't use for my curls."

After using this product, my hair is generally soft but I donu2019t find the frizz to be moderately reduced when I wear my hair natural. If i blowout my hair or heat style, I generally have better results and less frizz. Not a bad option if your hair is straight/wavy, but I donu2019t find it to be enough for my curly hair"

I did like it to help detangle but I did not feel like it was very hydrating for courser hair types. There are other products that help detangle while also helping curls form and hydrate at the same time. The smell reminds me of Baccarat rouge 540. I prefer more water/beach clean smell but if you are a fan of warmer more vanilla scents, you will appreciate this smell."

I've never used a leave-in conditioner because I was worried they would make my hair feel greasy. I didn't find that with this product! In fact, it seems like I haven't used any product at all on my hair. The only real difference is that I use mousse for my waves, and my hair hasn't seemed crunchy after using this product alongside the mousse. That is about the only benefit I've had, unfortunately. I wouldn't buy this product for myself because it hasn't helped to hydrate my hair. However, I might recommend this if your hair isn't extremely thirsty like mine is. It just may not be strong enough for heavily bleached, thick hair. I thought it might be really easy to use as a spray, but it's awkward to hold and spray the bottle throughout my hair. The push-down on the spray is tough. Maybe just need to be used longer. It smells good at first, but once I've sprayed it a few times, the smell is too strong and almost chemically-sweet. I definitely think this product is good for others, but it just didn't work for me. There may be other Verb products that suit my needs better!"

In fact, my hair was so soft and sleek, it was difficult putting it into a claw clip for the day at work - because my hair was just that smooth. I applied 5-6 sprays to towel dried hair and brushed through. That was it! A little goes a long way and I can see this bottle lasting me awhile. Will be using this after every wash!!
