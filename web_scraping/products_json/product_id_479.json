Iu2019ve tried so many other eye creams that claim to reduce dark circles/bags/fine lines, but end up drying out my eyes or literally do absolutely nothing. For whatever reason, my left eye always gets dry and crusty, to the point that it burns. So I was looking for something that would keep my under eyes hydrated, while actually doing what it claims. This eye cream is phenomenal. After the first time I used it, I could already see a difference in my dark circles and it keeps my under eyes hydrated all day long. If youu2019re thinking about it, just get it. You wonu2019t be disappointed."

I stopped using it today and my eyes feel mostly back to normal, and this was the only new product in my routine.  I've used other vitamin C products before so I'm not sure what about this I am reacting to."
