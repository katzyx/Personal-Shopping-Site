Itu2019s floral and delicious without being overwhelming. If a scent could be classified as u201cclassyu201d this would be it; very luxe.   The product itself doesnu2019t do the best job at taming flyaways, but it also doesnu2019t weight down the rest of my tresses. Instead, it leaves them silky, shiny and soft and enhances my natural waves in a way that prevents me from having to do any other styling, so thatu2019s a trade-off Iu2019m willing to make. If you have relatively healthy, wavy hair and want to be able to wash and go, this product just might be the right one for you!"

It also has a very light and floral scent, which adds to a more luxurious experience.

I love it because my hair is looking good again, shinny, healthy and sooooooft. And not felling heavy or leaving my hair with stickyness or felling heavy. The smell is light and delightful and the best part is how soft and moisturize my hands are after putting in my hair and adding a last dab for my hands (and elbows!)"

It leaves my hands feeling silky smooth without the greasy feeling, the only downside is that it doesnu2019t penetrate your skin so it washes off easily. It also smells really good which is a plus for me."

The first thing I noticed was that the scent is exactly that of a cherry Jolly Rancher. Not what I expected from a luxury product...but I don't exactly hate it! I am giving this product a mixed review because that's what I found it to be. A product with mixed objectives, trying to do too much and not able to achieve all of its promises. The bad: it didn't get there for me as a moisturizing hair balm. I have thick hair with some wave and didn't notice any additive moisture after use. There was also very minimal instruction of how much to use. A pea size? A quarter? More? I was mindful that I didn't want it to feel greasy either so maybe I didn't use enough and will continue to be hopeful and play with the range, but I just wasn't impressed. I typically use an olive oil based conditioner and see better results from that. The good news: As a skin balm, this is great! I used this on rougher areas like elbows and feet and it has kept them very smooth."

I need some serious moisturizer for my skin year-round but this is quite light. I think this would be ideal for anyone looking for something non-greasy and something that sinks into the skin quickly. It smells heavenly, the scent is a perfect match for honeysuckle. It seriously softened my skin upon application although I wish the moisture lasted a bit longer throughout the day.   This is marketed as a balm but I think is not what I think of when I think of a balm - the product is very light, not thick. I use the Shu Uemura Rice Water Tonic in my hair which is LEGIT but I donu2019t think this a superstar product for the price."

I guess it adds a light moisture to the hair. But I found it works really well in hair if you dilute it with water and olive oil a bit after putting it in. Still a cool product bc I can use it for hair and body and. I used it on my 2 year olds curly think hair and it helps, if I dilute it. In a rush tho it gets the job done just for curly hair I think you need to add water so it doesnu2019t weigh the hair down."

This product is nothing short of a game-changer.  First and foremost, the packaging is both sleek and convenient. The small jar is easy to store and take on the go, making it perfect for travel. But the real magic lies inside the jar.  The balm itself is a silky, lightweight texture that instantly melts into my hair without leaving any greasy residue. I have fine, straight hair, and I was initially worried that this balm might be too heavy, but I was pleasantly surprised. It's incredibly nourishing without weighing my hair down.  The scent is heavenly u2013 a delicate floral aroma that lingers throughout the day, leaving my hair smelling fresh and luxurious.  The true beauty of this product lies in its versatility. I use it as a pre-shampoo treatment to deeply nourish my hair, as a leave-in conditioner to tame frizz and add shine, and even as a styling aid to smooth flyaways. It works wonders in all these roles, and a little goes a long way.  After just a few weeks of incorporating Shu Uemura's Essence Absolue Nourishing Universal Balm into my haircare routine, I've noticed a remarkable improvement in the overall health and appearance of my hair. It looks and feels softer, shinier, and healthier than ever before.  While this product may come with a higher price tag, it's undoubtedly worth every penny. If you're looking for a versatile, high-quality hair treatment that delivers on its promises, I highly recommend giving Shu Uemura's Essence Absolue Nourishing Universal Balm a try. It's now a staple in my haircare collection, and I can't imagine going without it."
