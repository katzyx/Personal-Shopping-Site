This one has taken over as my holy grail product. It's so hudrating and has a lovely thick formula. There is a good amount of product especially as a little goes a long way. My advice is just to squeeze it out gently as to not put too much as a lot can come out at one time. It is easy to apply and is not sticky at all. It immediately soothes chapped lips and heals them, especially when used overnight. If you do not light thicker balms this may not be for you but you can sheer it out with your fingers. If you suffer from chronically dry lips please try this! The ingredients are all of quality and do not contain any potential drying agents or irritants like fragrances.  Holy"

Yes the price point is higher than the average lip balm but this is for heavy duty care. I'm almost done my first tube and will be repurchasing. It is a thicker application than you're used to applying but I always make sure to use a bit before walking the dog and before bed. In the morning I wake up with smooth hydrated lips. I'll give this 5 stars because $25 is a small price to pay when nothing else works for your dry chapped lips. My lips do still get dry sometimes but I just apply some of this and problem solved.

            "review_text": "I was skeptical about this stuff, but the reviews had me curious so I tried it. I AM SO GLAD I DID. It's thick enough to feel moisturizing, but not enough to be all sticky. It has a really smooth texture that leaves my usually very chapped lips feeling soothed and soft. I'm curious to see how long it lasts because it is a pretty small tube, but I'm hopeful that it lasts long enough to make it worth the price. (I haven't noticed any lip-plumping, but I didn't really care about that when I purchased it.) It doesn't have a scent or a taste, which is a bonus for me, especially since it has a light Vaseline-y consistency (without feeling gross like Vaseline does IMO). The applicator is rounded, which I wasn't crazy about at first, but it does help spread the product over your lips without leaving any behind, wasting less product (which is always a bonus). I think found a new favorite lip product."

In general, fragrance in skincare is unnecessary, but it's ESPECIALLY bad if you have sensitive skin. It will just irritate your lips even more. Keep in mind, everyone's skin is different. However, I recommend trying this because there's a good chance it will work for you if it worked for me after trying so many different lip products. I've been using this for a while now and my lips rarely ever get chapped, and if they do, I use a lip scrub (GENTLY) to remove the dead skin and then apply this product. It works amazing."

I wanted to give the product the benefit of the doubt and kept using it, and it would just make the sores worse. When I didn't use the product, my lips would feel drier than they did before. I really wanted to love this product, but sadly it had a negative outcome on me. Be careful! My sores are currently healing since I've been off the product for a couple of days now. The laneige sleeping mask and lip balms wear away quicker, but they are a lot safer than this product and give me no side effects."

Same ingredients and packaging, they just changed which line it's in (Pep Start vs moisture surge).  This is my holy grail product that I cannot live without. I'm rouge because I spend all my money on skincare but if I could only have one product for the rest of my life this would be it!  It's a wonderful lip treatment and can be worn day and/or night. It isn't sticky, more so gooey but in a wonderful way! Can't recommend this product enough 10/10"
