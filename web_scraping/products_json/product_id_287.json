This one has taken over as my holy grail product. Itu2019s so hudrating and has a lovely thick formula. There is a good amount of product especially as a little goes a long way. My advice is just to squeeze it out gently as to not put too much as a lot can come out at one time. It is easy to apply and is not sticky at all. It immediately soothes chapped lips and heals them, especially when used overnight. If you do not light thicker balms this may not be for you but you can sheer it out with your fingers. If you suffer from chronically dry lips please try this! The ingredients are all of quality and do not contain any potential drying agents or irritants like fragrances.  Holy"

Yes the price point is higher than the average lip balm but this is for heavy duty care. I'm almost done my first tube and will be repurchasing. It is a thicker application than you're used to applying but I always make sure to use a bit before walking the dog and before bed. In the morning I wake up with smooth hydrated lips. I'll give this 5 stars because $25 is a small price to pay when nothing else works for your dry chapped lips. My lips do still get dry sometimes but I just apply some of this and problem solved.

It's thick enough to feel moisturizing, but not enough to be all sticky. It has a really smooth texture that leaves my usually very chapped lips feeling soothed and soft. I'm curious to see how long it lasts because it is a pretty small tube, but I'm hopeful that it lasts long enough to make it worth the price. (I haven't noticed any lip-plumping, but I didn't really care about that when I purchased it.) It doesn't have a scent or a taste, which is a bonus for me, especially since it has a light Vaseline-y consistency (without feeling gross like Vaseline does IMO). The applicator is rounded, which I wasn't crazy about at first, but it does help spread the product over your lips without leaving any behind, wasting less product (which is always a bonus). I think found a new favorite lip product."

            "review_text": "I have had really dry lips for a while now and I think have tried almost every brand on the market. Biossance, Blistex, Laneige, Bite Beauty, just to name a few... Nothing worked as well as this. I love how there is no fragrance which is the best thing when your lips are already irritated and dry. In general, fragrance in skincare is unnecessary, but it's ESPECIALLY bad if you have sensitive skin. It will just irritate your lips even more. Keep in mind, everyone's skin is different. However, I recommend trying this because there's a good chance it will work for you if it worked for me after trying so many different lip products. I've been using this for a while now and my lips rarely ever get chapped, and if they do, I use a lip scrub (GENTLY) to remove the dead skin and then apply this product. It works amazing."

Altogether, I apply this lip balm once or twice during the day and my lips stay totally hydrated. There is no plumping affect, but I don't believe the product was intended to be like the TwoFaced Lip Injection lip plumper. If you want something to mainly plump your lips, this isn't the product for you. If you're looking for a super hydrating, longlasting lip balm, this is it."

After a very busy summer with lots of outdoor time, I noticed how dry my lips were and pronounced pucker lines on my top lip. Two days of applying this product and I already feel a difference.  My parched lips heaved a sigh of relief!"

Iu2019m rouge because I spend all my money on skincare but if I could only have one product for the rest of my life this would be it!  Itu2019s a wonderful lip treatment and can be worn day and/or night. It isnu2019t sticky, more so gooey but in a wonderful way! Canu2019t recommend this product enough 10/10"
