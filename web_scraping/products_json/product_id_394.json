My skin responded well to the ordinary glycolic toner so I bought a sample pack of these and I was shocked at how they wrecked my skin with just one use.  Not everyone needs something of this strength and it can really mess with your skin barrier.  My skin is now super sensitive, red, flaking and breaking out in places I normally don't.  I'm using a barrier cream and gentle hydrating products and giving it some time to recover.  If after one use it seems like your skin is upset, cease and desist.  There are gentler glycolic products that are plenty effective.  I had also tried a sample of the M61 peel pads and those worked great for me.  These are just VERY strong."

I don't tend to get huge breakouts but I do get the occasional one to two on my cheeks, nose, and jaw. I don't think you need to use them everyday, more when you feel like you need it. I will say that I also tried some of the extra strength and even though I have drier skin I didn't feel a difference between them. I'm sure that if I used the extra strength in consecutive days there would be a difference but if you're looking for 3-5 times a week instead of every day you could go either way. I do notice a difference when I use them when I breakout! It's not an overnight miracle but I think it takes a day or two off the overall process of getting it to go away! You do also need a minute or two for each pad so if you're not interested in putting another 5 minutes into your skincare I wouldn't recommend! I like the extra little bit of time because it feels like a little treat and self care time.Overall, I like them a lot, but I will be buying the extra strength the next time around."

Unfortunately, this box is the personification of the devil for me. I didnu2019t have perfect skin but I didnu2019t have that much acne to begin with. These pads made me break out in a bunch of new spots and left me with hyperpigmentation that I am still struggling with. Attached are pictures of before and after.  Maybe I should have used the sensitive one, instead of the regular peels, but oh well. I have been using retinol before this so I thought I could do with the retinol in the universal one. I did not use the retinol pads and the gross pads on the same day, as I knew the gross pads had retinol in them.   So I started using this treatment relatively slow, I started with once a week and then twice. The first time I used it, I noticed a tingly feeling but I was like u201ceh, it should be fine.u201d  The second time I used it, the tingly feeling went away but my face still felt a bit dry. I then noticed my skin starting to break out a little bit. u201cMaybe itu2019s the purge from the retinol!u201d I thought to myself. So I continued to use the treatment, trying to slowly build my tolerance up and thinking that it was just a purge. A few months lateru2014 maybe about 3 or 4 monthsu2014 and about 15+ pads, the u201cpurgeu201d did not go away. I donu2019t think it was a purge. The reason why I let it continue on so long was because I thought that it was a purge and it would get worse before it got better. Nope! These pads just did not do well with my skin.    After discontinuing usage, my skin stopped breaking out but I am left with remnants of the hyperpigmentation. I should have known when I had acne in places Iu2019ve never had before. My skin has never looked as bad, not even when I was a teenager. I should have known before falling for the hype and buying 2 boxes on sale.

So, I decided to splurge on these as thorough research of the disclosed ingredients seemed like a reasonable solution to restore my clear skin. Unfortunately, it turned into my worst nightmare - SCARRING, CYSTIC ACNE and chronic inflammation on my facial skin that occurred gradually after using every other day as instructed for over 3 months. It couldn't have been a purge as my skin was accustomed to actives like retinoids before - I imagine it is something in the patented formulation or something else that seriously irritates my skin type. The effects are insidious as you think it'll get better after it gets worse, so I'll keep using but unfortunately it never got better for me. Now I have permanent scars. Looks like some others have had similar experiences.  My recommendation as someone who takes a very cautious, research-oriented approach to skin care and dermatology, and as a future physician with a breadth of dermatologic knowledge, ONLY turn to these if you already have severe cystic acne and your dermatologist recommends them to you, as it has worked wonders for some with these types of severe conditions. Do NOT use if you have relatively decent, young, resilient skin. I wish I had endured the small maskne-breakouts that would have healed since masks have been put away, than the permanent scars I have now from using this product. Definitely recommend other more gentler products in your skincare routine that are certainly more affordable as well.  Two stars only because I believe in the good of this product for some - the main active ingredients have much scientifically-backed potential. But I caution everyone to think twice about how potent of a product they really require."

However, this is not a product I would use every day, as instructed, for two reasons: firstly ALCOHOL - it's the 2nd ingredient in Step 1. Long term alcohol use on the skin is never a good thing, even when there's this many 'beneficial' ingredients in both of the pads that are counteracting it. The second reason is it's simply too much exfoliation for my skin. Step 1 includes 4 different AHA's and 1 BHA. That's the level of chemical exfoliation I aim for once a week or fortnight at most. Any more than that and I find my skin breaks out in random itchy hives and becomes more sensitive to the sun.  I only use AHA-containing products on a night, so after cleansing and removing makeup on a night, I wipe Step 1 over my face and neck for about a minute or so, and find something else to do for the required 1-2 minutes it takes for this to work. Then comes Step 2. It contains Sodium Bicarbonate to neutralize the acids from Step 1, as well as soothing ingredients such as Green Tea extract. The thing I like the most about these is that all the key anti-aging ingredients are in here (Retinol, Vitamin C etc) and I don't feel like I need to use any other anti-aging treatments or products afterwards.   ~ My Sephora Top 7 must-have list ~  (My top 7 must-have beauty products of all time, focusing mainly on my purchases at Sephora)  1.

I first tried this product as a sample over a year ago and noticed a difference overnight, so Iu2019ve periodically purchased 5 packs of this product to use before big events like weddings or vacations. When I use this product, I use it at night followed by Skinfix moisturizer (something thicker to lock in moisture). I hesitate to use this product every night because my skin dries out easily. On off nights, I use niacinamide and good moisturizers.   For anyone worried about bad reviews, please keep in mind that this product has retinol in step two. You WILL purge with this product, which for me happens about 2-3 uses. By the time I use all 5 pads, my skin is clearer than before. This is NORMAL with these products. Unless your skin is actually burning or your skin is very dry, you should keep going. I donu2019t think people realize that there is retinol in this. Drink a lot of water while using this to help flush your skin. The next layer of skin you grow while using this will come out clearer.   The end result for me after using 5 pads is that my skin is noticeably less congested and I see that my scars look a bit better. If this product was on sale, I would splurge to get a bigger pack to work more consistently on old acne scars."

My current regimen is using Dr.Gross cleanser daily and using the peel pads 1-2 times a week. I make sure to not use another mask, exfoliator, peel or toner within two days of the peel. If I do, then I will see irritation. For example, if I use the peel pads on Monday then I want exfoliate or peel again until Thursday. This way my skin gets time to heal and does not get inflamed. I do find that a nice creamy, soothing mask is complementary to the peel pads especially if I use the pads at night and the soothing mask in the morning when I wake up or vice versa. My skin is dry, sensitive, melanated and thanks to these pads smooth, no pigmentation and helped eliminate ingrown hairs ;)"

Over the last 8 months or so, Iu2019ve had hormonal acne getting worse and worse. Iu2019m 30 and have always struggled with acne, but had it fairly under control with spironolactone and a good skin care regimen. For some reason, my hormones have been out of whack lately and itu2019s affected my skin, especially before my period. Deeper, cystic acne on my chin, near me nose, and around my mouth. They would pop up out of nowhere and leave ugly red marks behind for months. I decided to give this a try to help lighten some of the red marks and clear my pores, not expecting it to help the cystic acne at all. Well, not only did it clear up active acne, whenever I get what could be a pimple it is immediately reduced by using this once every night. I even had my period with no active acne (including cystic!) for the first time in almost a year. My skin is so smooth, clear and my old acne scars are starting to fade really well. I donu2019t care how expensive this is, I will literally use it forever because itu2019s THAT good."

Iu2019ve never heard a board certified dermatologist use the term u201cpurge,u201d but itu2019s an apt description of what I experienced. The A/B peel accelerates skin cell turnover, so if youu2019re acne prone you do run the risk of bringing blemishes to the surface very rapidly. But the life cycle of the blemishes is also accelerated, so theyu2019ll subside as quickly as they appear. (Oh my though, they are dramatic looking. Ugh!) My advice is to power through.

I have somewhat sensitive skin, and I really only felt a little discomfort for the first couple times.  I've made several of my friends use this and WOW I cannot recommend it more.

You need your skin to build up to them so try ultra gentle first. Over time, breakouts reduce and scars will fade, and a brighter more even complexion emerges. I have purchased these many times and love that through Sephora you get a few extra as bonus, as per pad they are something like $3-4 each. I use after washing face or showering and skip toner due to the neutralizer step, which balances the ph of the skin. Proceed with serum (nothing too active when I use these) and moisturizer. You need hydration after use.   Ps. Now my skin has calmed down (no acne) and I aim to use 1-2x per week."

My face immediately looked a little brighter. Felt a little smother. But this morning I looked at myself and took a double take!  My skin hasnu2019t glowed this much since I was in my 20u2019s!  I absolutely love this product line and will always keep these daily peel pass in stock."

            "review_text": "I bought this product for my pimples after developing quite the acne spot from constant use of masks and especially the humidity and sweatiness while wearing them in the summer.   I would best describe my skin as: quite sensitive, oily on the T-zone (especially my nose), normal every where else, pimple prone on the outer cheeks and a bit every where else, has discolouration, around mouth and chin, doesnu2019t tolerate a lot of product and a lot of steps, may be dehydrated.  I would say this if I had to describe the product and itu2019s effects on me: a daily exfoliating and repairing treatment that penetrates the skin and helps accelerate the natural cell turnover of my skin, deeply cleans pores, reduces and stables oil production and leaves my skin more radiant and even looking.   How I use this product at night: I double cleanse with an oil based cleanser, wipe my face dry, apply step 1, wait 2 min, apply step 2, wait 2 min, apply moisturizer.   The product does sting a little bit and may make your face more red for a min and pimples more apparent when applying, but the redness of the pimples should go down after a nights rest.   Now I will say this, this is in no way a miracle product (though it impresses me quite a bit), you have to be consistent and keep using it for your pimples to go down and keep buying it again. In no way will it clear your skin after 1-2 weeks of use that is just asking for the impossible (I use them every other day). Take your budget into account, because it is quite expensive. You may be looking at a 6 weeks+ for clearing skin and really getting the full effect (and it depends on your acne and skin condition) look at it realistically and you wonu2019t be let down.    A money saving tip is to cut the product in half and seal the rest (half is enough trust me)   I cannot recommend this product as every skin is different and you know best what fits it, but I would say to try the 5 packs to see what strength is good for you."

I noticed a change a week in but remained consistent with use and 3 weeks in I see a big change in glow, and fewer fine lines.  I feel like I shaved years off my face.  Grateful to have found this!"

I have tried the sensitive version of these as well, but I don't think they do as much as the original/regular treatment.  Yes they are pricy, but I think they're well worth the price-point, especially if you use them the way I do (and many other women I know).  Just make sure you give your skin lots of moisture following treatment, and don't wait too long after the first step if you have sensitive skin (you may get some unwanted redness/irritation)."

My skin cleared up and my stubborn hyperpigmentation began to fade - slowly.  I feel like the pictures will speak for themselves.  First picture is from June 2020, second is October 2020 (and I was having a bad face week).  I still use it almost daily.   FYI: I did try the extra strength one and it was too much for my skin. If anything it backfired and my skin broke out more. So I switched back to this product and itu2019s already so much happier."

I started off with the Universal Daily Peel because my skin is fairly sensitive on top of it all. Here are a few tips I gathered from personal experience and other comments if anyone is considering this product: - Start this product slowly and work your way up to using it every day - One wipe can be used for 2 days. Just make sure you store the wipes in a sealed container like a Ziploc bag to prevent the wipes from getting tried out. Its an expensive product, so doubling the usage helps.  -There is a good chance you will experience purging when you start this product. Purging skin happens when an active ingredient, such as retinol, increases skin cell turnover rate which leads to breakouts. That's normal. The zits should go away on their own after a while.  The reason I gave this product a 4 out of 5 and stopped using it is because of the packaging. I just found it wasteful to continue throwing away the wipes every other day. Im trying a different product with retinol in it for the sake of limiting waste.   I would still recommend this product for anyone battling acne because at the time I didn't know much about skincare and this product helped greatly."

I used to get cystic pimples all around my jawline and chin to the point where I would call in sick out of embarrassment of my face. My sensitive skin had rejected almost any acne regime and even a dermatologist prescription so when I say I tried everything I mean EVERYTHING.   Flash forward to me finally biting the bullet and giving this peel a go, three days in I was sold. Unlike all products that claim u201cit will get worse before it gets betteru201d this product works like magic where you just see fresh glowing skin coming through.  I wish I took before and after pictures because you wouldnu2019t believe I ever struggled with acne, as this is also amazing for any dark spots or scaring!

I decided to buy it again and accidentally grabbed the universal box which I've never used. I'm currently on my 2nd wipe for the week and already notice a huge difference. This wipe is balancing my skin while also getting rid of dark marks and wrinkles. My skin feels baby soft. Even though it says to add a moisturizer, I feel like I don't need to because my skin is beginning to feel naturally moisturized without being too oily. I also have acne scarring, so far there hasn't been a change but I will keep you updated. I highly recommend these wipes to anyone looking to slow down aging!"

After 3 use, I had: - Clearer skin (small blemishes were gone) - Firmer Skin - Smoother & Softer Skin - Diminished my dark spots  Overall, I love this product but its magic honestly reaches a plateau after 5-10 uses. My dark spots weren't really able to have any noticeable lift in pigmentations afterward. On the other hand, my regular skin routine was capable of maintaining the results that I had just achieved, so I stopped using the pads.  On the bright side, these pads won't expire for a while so I'm saving them up to use again after summer or when I have really bad skin again."

In just THREE uses my under skin acne is almost gone, and pores almost completely clear. I am in complete shock that FINALLY after well over a decade of searching, and wasting countless dollars something delivers again. Sunday Riley, and Tatcha used to work fine enough (not great), but again, both have changed formulas like everything else for whatever reason so I have been desperately trying to find something without having to turn to, and rely on the hefty cost of laser treatments. I have found it! I am overjoyed. If you have high maintenance skin, try this. If you can invest in your skincare do not pass this. Start with the milder formulas first if you are not all, but plagued by your skin, but, if you suffer from large pores, visible clogging, acne, and/or extreme oil production, you owe this to yourself to at least TRY the trial."

I think the alcohol in these wipes is over-drying beyond the AHA/BHA. My face was always red and tight even after moisturizers and my skin never got used to it even after 2-3 boxes. I switched to a cheaper cleanser (use at nightime only instead) and it has shown me better skin renewal.  I think this was a great easy intro to AHA / BHA and anyone who is still being lazy about their routine can start here and move on after to something better once they are more open to the possibilities of chemical exfoliants and do more research to really perfect their results."

Breakouts have been reduced in a significant way, and my skin is much smoother/less red, milia have been slowly disappearing and whiteheads/blackheads have been clearing up and not returning. I have sensitive/combination skin, so I've been cautious when using any hardcore products, because some acids will trigger additional irritation and breakouts... but these wipes have been perfect and I'm so impressed with the results, I plan to continue purchasing products in this line! I wish I had some before photos to upload... truly such a huge difference to my skin!"

It was so frustrating because they left marks on my cheeks and they would just never heal. They would gradually minimize, but ALWAYS came back up. I decided to try the alpha beta peels and considering the price I was pretty hesitant. I used ALL of the pads in a course of about 3 months. I didn't want to bombard my face with the formula, since I do have sensitive skin. So I did about 1 peel pad a week. Then gradually I started twice a week and so on and so forth. I will say this... this product can work for you but you can NOT expect it to fix all your problems in 2 weeks. It takes time, it took me three months to notice significant changes. I am so HAPPY b/c my face has cleared so much and looks healthy and those 4 pimples btw GONE. (;"

I couldnu2019t tell when this actually started working but my daughter noticed when she came home from college that my hyperpigmentation wasnu2019t as dark and prominent. I can pass as having freckles on my outer cheek bones. I donu2019t feel as self conscious about my skin as before I started using this product. I still have hyperpigmentation because I had to stop using this product due to food allergies (created extreme skin sensitivity) but now that we have identified the problem I am definitely repurchasing!

It resurfaced my skin so it was baby-smooth, reduced the look of wrinkles and evened out my skin tone. I also had a small scar on my nose which faded much faster when I used this product! Finally, I suffer from cystic acne; I had a big one coming in on my chin (these last for WEEKS and they are very painful). I used the peel a few days in a row and the zit magically disappeared!!  To extend this product, I cut the pads in half and share it with my husband lol. I always go back to this peel and now that my husband loves it too I'm sure we will always have it in the house."

It preps the skin for other products, as I can feel my skin just drinks up the serum and moisturizer right away afterwards. The only down side is the price tag, so I started to cut the pads in half, and there's no noticeable difference for me. 2 boxes of these later, although I didn't notice much reduction with my dark spots, but my skin's overall condition is at its best!

It's an expensive thing to just pick up and try, but it works. The only downside is that it takes a long time to apply. If you don't have the time for that you can cut the sheets in half and use the other half the next day. What I do is rub it all over my face until it gets dry and then I put it on my neck, chest and the top of my hands. This means it takes about 10 minutes to apply because there is a lot of product on those little sheets. I even scrape out the remaining drops left over in the bag."

Because of my sensitivity, I use this peel every other day instead of the recommended daily use. I did experience some mild sensitivity after my first few sessions, slight redness and some stinging, but after my skin got used to the formula, I havenu2019t had any of that. I am THRILLED with the results. I have noticed a marked improvement with regards to my fine lines and enlarged pores, and more importantly, my makeup wears SO much better. My foundation looks way more natural and seamless, and I have found it lasts much longer throughout my day as well.

I cleanse, tone, peel, serum and follow with a moisturizer. I use it on my face, neck, decolletage and the backs of my hands. Donu2019t forget to use sunscreen before going out into the sun. I donu2019t have any wrinkles but Iu2019m all about prevention. So I love the anti-aging properties in step 2. Step 1 does sting a little which is normal. Step 2 will neutralize the peel and the stinging should stop. Now that I have been using it for awhile it doesnu2019t sting everyday as my skin has built up a tolerance. There offer different levels depending on your needs and skin type. So if you have sensitive skin try the one for that. This one is for normal skin or individuals who have peeled before. Of course they have extra strength  for experienced peelers and for individuals with bad acne and visible wrinkles. It can be used every other day until youu2019ve built up a tolerance. They have a customer for life."

Iu2019m 12 days into the treatment and all I can say is wow! My skin has never looked so even. My scars, dark and red spots began fading so fast itu2019s unbelievable! My pores are so much tighter and the whiteheads have significantly went down. I can easily say this product will be a consistent part of my skincare routine going forward.

The product cleaned my pores so well, just so happy with this product!"

With all that being said, it does have denatured alcohol listed as the second ingredient, so for those of you with sensitive and or dry skin, it might be a little too intense for you. It does say any skin type can use this product, but I would limit it to using it every other night. Buy the five pack to see if you get any negative reactions first. But even with all that, I still recommend!!!"

I was having a hard time getting my skin back to normal and kept getting breakouts. I read the great reviews about this product and decided to purchase the 5 treatments to try it out. I thought about getting the sensitive version, but decided to stick with the universal ones after reading reviews. When I applied Step 1 during my nighttime routine, my skin tingled a little bit, but I waited the full 2 minutes and applied Step 2. I followed with my normal moisturizer. I noticed a difference in the texture of my skin right away. The next morning my skin was so smooth and felt incredible! Iu2019ve now been using the daily peel 1-2 times a week and my skin has remained smooth and soft. I would use this every day if it wasnu2019t so expensive, but even once a week is enough to keep your skin healthy. Definitely recommend to all!"

I highly recommend this product and just re-ordered and will be upping my usage to slough off the dead skin cells. I tried the extra strength version but it was too strong for my skin and burned a little. If you have more sensitive skin, I'd definitely recommend this version.

I have combo skin, a little more on the oily side, very acne/hormonal prone and sometimes sensitive. I will eventually want to try the extra strength once I build the tolerance. Okay now For the good stuff, so I tried it last night and have maybe like 5 acne scars/pigmentations and 2 active pimples, 1 cysts on my jawline, another on my forehead thatu2019s bean there for a month and nothing will take it away!! The next morning I noticed my pigmentations where much lighter. The two active acne are finally dry and significantly reduced the inflammation, pain, and itchiness. I know it doesnu2019t sound like much overnight but again i tried everything to get rid of the pimple on my forehead with benzoyl Peroxide which usually works, only this peel got it to get dry and with the cyst acne if you have these mother effers you know nothing works to get rid of it and just in one night Itu2019s dry and itu2019s dying !! Iu2019m so excited to finish these and get in the habit of using it to move up to extra strength!! Take a chance you will never know if itu2019s your magic potion until you try it !! Good luck !!"

Years and years ago when I worked at Sephora my skin was so bad mostly due to hereditary cystic acne passed down from my mom. I was so afraid it would keep progressing and that I would need to go on acutane like my mom. Something I was hoping to avoid at all costs because it can be quite intense on your body. Luckily I learnt so much about this brand and had many many colleagues tell me that this specific brand will do miracles. They were right! I have used the ferulic acid and retinol pads (night time), the original formula (day time) and once a week I used to do the medi-spa peels (same strength as Dr. Dennis uses in his office). For the past two years my skin was amazing. I stopped buying the peels because my skin got so good. Now I am engaged and super super stressed out about my wedding Iu2019m having some skin issues again. Iu2019m not worried though because I know that these peels will be a quick month or two fix and my skin will be all balanced again. I donu2019t work for Sephora anymore but if I did this would still be my number one recommendation for women wanting smoother, brighter, clear, poreless looking skin.  Pro tip: you can cut the pads in half and stick the other half in the fridge and get two days. Or use the full thing and also use the pads on your hands!!! Keep your hands and neck as youthful as your face. Use the pad till itu2019s basically dry that way you get the most use out of it."

So in desperation, I started using these Dr Gross pads- first every other day, then daily. Now, after a month of using the pads, my skin looks great, scars have faded, skin tone has evened out, and I now love leaving the house without foundation! HOW TO MAKE THE MOST OUT OF THIS PRODUCT: - The slight tingling sensation after putting on Step 1 may feel weird at first, but itu2019s expected since it is a peel. Like the instructions say, use the product every other day if it feels too much. - USE SUNSCREEN! This should be a given every day, but itu2019s especially important with this product. You can actually damage your skin if you use this product without applying skinscreen. - I personally like applying this product in the evening, but the instructions say you can use it in the AM / PM."

It must have caused my skin to act/flare up and my face felt bumpy, dry and uncomfortable for days after. Makeup did not apply well and it felt so dry that I temporarily thought I had eczema!

But my main problem was not the breakouts or blackheads, it was the acne scars! They stay for many years no matter what I do! I came across these wipes and I was skeptical! Wipes for chemical peal?!!! Really?!!! But once I tried them...it was a new birth to my skin, it is softer, more elastic and....most importantly, my acne scars are fading so fast that Iu2019m getting closer and closer to a flawless skin. And it is a given...if you do chemical peals regularly, your skin wonu2019t breakout...it is simple! There is no dead skin or clogged pores to attract bacteria. So Iu2019m breaking out a lot less and even when I do, they are gone in a day or two!  Two advice I want to give if you decided to try this product: 1- go first with the extra gentle ones and then work your way to the universal and then eventually the  extra strength ones if you can take it. Chemical peal is harsh and can cause irritation at first, you want your skin to adapt first so that your peals are painless. 2- I use them every other day not daily for 2 reasons, first because my skin in sensitive so chemical peals every day may be too harsh no matter how long you have been using them and in the days I donu2019t peal I use retinol to renew and moisturize my skin. secondly to be a little more economic, 30+5 wipes last me 70 days instead of 35 days if I use them daily so the $88 wonu2019t be too expensive if it is for something you will use for more than 2 months. I highly recommend it! It will change your skin to the better and youu2019ll find them indispensable in your skin care regimen."

Itu2019s super pricey but hereu2019s a tip; use it 3 times a week so it can last up to 3 months and every day for 3 months save a dollar, so by the time itu2019s done you already have $90 saved.

You definitely want to use a moisturizer after. But my skin looks amazing! I love this and now share this secret with all my friends.

It's really easy to use. I love that the treatments are individually packed, because I travel a lot and I didn't need to buy the 5 treatment pack in order to use these on the go.   I personally started with this peel because I thought my sensitive skin won't take the extra strength well, but I was wrong, so I switched to it. But you can always start with the 5-pack one, try it out and see which one of the two formulas you like best.  You don't have to buy the 60 pad package if you want to save some money, because I did the math and the 30   5 free comes at the same price of $ 2.5 per treatment. Don't forget to use sunscreen every day, even if you use these only at night. And last life hack from me - unless you are using it on your neck and chest as well, you can actually cut one pad in half, put it in a zip lock bag and use half of the size of the pad, the pad is pretty large and soaked through, so if you are only doing your face, half a pad will do it. But if you want to cover a larger area, one pad can be used for both of your face AND these everywhere where you might need it - back of your hands, shoulders, decolte, neck, etc. If you are having signs of aging or dark spots, you can use these anywhere on your body."

So I tested it out with the 5-pack and have been buying the 5-pack for months now. I am hooked. Theyu2019re so easy to use. Perfect for right before makeup, or for right before bed. I prefer them for right before bedtime as you have this glowing effect with minimized pores and acne in the morning. Yep I said it.   These are amazing Peel Pads. Yes it does tingle and slightly sting but that goes right away. Then I follow up with my skincare.   ***NOTE: This is not to be washed off.***  Iu2019m trying to use them enough to start using the extra strength but trust me, youu2019ll see a difference in your skin.

I took a nap and when I woke up it was the complete opposite. All of my clear skin looks/feels so smooth, and the marks on my cheeks overall look better! I had two bumps of my cheeks for like a month and they feel more like pimples now which Is great because I can finally treat them. I REALLY like this product, I cut my wipes in half and put them in the fridge, you can definitely get two uses out of the packet. Iu2019ll use again in a week and if the results are this good again Iu2019ll be buying the 5 packet, cutting in 3u2019s and only treating my cheeks.

Too much of a good thing I guess - now I use one every few weeks for a skin pick-me-up. I bought these to address hyperpigmentation and texture  issues. They help with texture but I have not seen any big differences in hyperpigmentation. I also do not see a difference in active blemishes as far as size or redness when I use these pads.   If you want a skincare splurge I would go ahead and get these pads - definitely try the sample pack before buying. If you want a cheaper alternative, I found that the Nip&Fab Extreme pads work well."

If you have dry skin like me, make sure to moisturize after the second step, or it could dry your skin out even more.

I know it's very expensive for the 30 treatments so I would suggest purchasing the 5 treatments for $16 if you are on the fence. If you really lean on reviews however, bite the bullet and get the pack of 30 treatments. Worth it & you will not regret it. My skin has some uneven skin tone from the sun, a few fine lines (I'm in my early 30's) as well as breakouts which are a bit more infrequent now that I'm older, and since using these, I am obsessed with how my skin looks and feels.

Unfortunately it doesn't seem to have too much of an effect on my acne, although I've used countless products and I think it's hormonal and I have to fix it from the inside. What it does seem to help is acne scarring and lightening up freckles and dark spots. I love how many good things are in it and I am doing some prevention, too. Try these! The main thing is your skin will be more radiant! Also I would start by doing them every 2 days since they are somewhat strong at first!"

The Peel removes and exfoliates in areas such as between the eyebrows and where your nose meets your face. I really like these peels and will continue to use them.

I've tried nearly every product under the sun (including changing all of my make-up multiple times) and my skin care routine takes about 20 mins. each morning and night. I hesitate to go to the dermatologist because I keep thinking I can get it under control by using high quality make-up, face washes, serums, creams, and of course, my clarisonic, but no dice. I bought this as my last ditch effort before conceding and scheduling a dermatologist appointment and WHOA am I glad I did.   I've never left a review on Sephora, but I absolutely had to for this miracle product. No BS, this stuff is insane good. I've used it for a week now and it not only forced the blackheads out of my entire face, but left my complexion smoother, my pores less visible, and it's lightened my dark spots and it's reduced my fine lines. I wouldn't consider my skin sensitive, but it's not overly tolerant to retinoids (I used to be on Retin-A-Micro and it never agreed with me). I do not get irritated using this product. The second wipe takes away any irritation caused by the first wipe. I use it at night just in case it makes my skin red and I SOO look forward to my skin care regimen at night now. After the treatment, I spray an aloe and rose-hip water on my face and that usually calms any redness or irritation I may have.  For someone that doesn't write reviews at all to gush like this, pay attention. If you struggle with blackheads/dark spots, take a leap of faith, buy in bulk, and FINALLY enjoy the skin you've been desperate trying to achieve your entire life."

But that's how they get you, the ingredients don't include a percentage of the acids used, so it could be 1% glycolic acid, etc, which doesn't make a difference at all for any skin type. You're better off buying a alpha beta peel for Skin Obsession which is super straight forward and doing it once every 3 weeks for MUCH cheaper than this. And in no time you will see the difference because that's a real peel with a concentration of 30% of Glycolic and Salicylic acids. Would not buy again or recommend, this is nothing but an expensive make up remover.  Also, for those interested in this product for acne purposes:  1) Clean your face with Castille Soap 2) Tone with a solution of Apple cider vinegar (1 part apple cider to two water) 4) Finish it off with moisturizing with an essential oil that is non-comedogenic like Argan Oil 4) If really necessary, use a treatment like topical Retin-A  And change your diet! Cut dairy, sugars and processed food. Get some L-Lysine, Probiotics and Zinc (which is comparable to antibiotics given for acne). Don't believe me? Do your own web research."

I have combination skin with a lot of texture and acne on my chin. I am especially dry on my cheeks and have little oil production on my tzone.

Good news/bad news for me was that if I have a black head, the day after I use this, it will have pulled it out into a whitehead. That sucks, but then it eventually goes away, and I know this is doing a deep clean of my skin.   I'll continue to buy these-I'm totally hooked.

I was skeptical at first because they are expensive but I was desperate to try something that would help clear up a moderate acne breakout that I had been suffering for about 2 months after not having any major problems with acne for about 1-2 years. I had a few pustules and a number of white heads and black heads. Now, they are all completely gone! My skin is radiant, clear, and my pores have shrunk significantly--in 5 days! I also use benzoyl peroxide during the day and retin-a at night after I use the peel and moisturize, but using the BP and retin-a alone did nothing to clear up my skin. I think that peel pads finally allowed my products to really penetrate my skin and fight all of those acne causing bacteria! I honestly couldn't be happier. I just ordered a full size box of the Extra Strength peels because I heard they're even better for acne prone/oily skin. $88 dollars a month is 100% worth it to have clear, beautiful glowing skin! Don't hesitate to buy them! My only regret is not buying them sooner!"

We all know how depressing it annoying it can be dealing with troublesome skin. Normally there's not a quick fix when it comes to skincare, but you will see results with this product very fast within maybe just two days. I recommend using it at night so your skin can rest and this product can do it's magic. Been using this consistently for about a month and half maybe two and I have seen a reduction in pore size, post acne scars have started to smoothen out, my skin tone has evened out, and it also it helps calm problematic acne, and helps heal your skin way faster than normal. I have very very sensitive skin, as well as combo skin. So I can get very oily, or very dry depending on what products I use. This will transform your make up application. Just drink plenty of water, and I'm sure you will not dissapointed. Thank you for this wonderfeul product."

It takes several minutes for each pad to lose its moisture, plus the 2 minute wait in between, so when all is said and done you need to sink 10 minutes into the process.  Maybe others are more devoted, but that's just too much extra work to add on to my daily skincare routine.

This is one product that I think (as long as I can afford it) I will keep repurchasing.  I purchased the 5 treatments for $16 and used that up.  This morning I noticed the appearance of the milia under my eyes has diminished in size.  If you have milia you will know these suckers are near impossible to get rid of without manually removing, which can leave scarring if not done professionally.  I'm not sure if this is suppose to be used so close to the eyes, but it works so I will continue do to so.  It only stings for a few minutes then goes away.  I have also had a few acne spots lately which this has helped fade faster.  I think this is a great product that actually delivers.  I would recommend to anyone wanting to fade acne marks and even texture."

It instantly reduced the feel of texture on my face and visibly minimized my pores. The full 5 days in, I was completely hooked. Just saving up to splurge on a larger amount of treatments! It even reduced deep, deep acne scars on my best friend, whose makeup I did for her wedding last month, and her skin never looked better!

The first time I tried this I was amazed, my redness was reduced, pores smaller and just felt clean without feeling stripped. I have pretty good skin anyway, but this just took it up a notch. My husband even asked me if I did something different. I said I would buy a pack if I got the same result with the 2nd and 3rd pad. I used them a week in between. Each time, couldn't believe how good my skin looked. It glows! And my redness and dry patches are gone. I immediately went to Sephora and bought the 60 pack.

I usually don't review many things because I figure why take that time out of my already busy schedule BUT I simply could not go without writing a review for this. Though the price is something that may steer many away at first, I can assure you that this product is worth a try! Not sure if you're skin can handle it? Sephora usually has a single sample that they can give you in stores to use at home. I tried this and had not bad results. The next day I went back and bought the 5 day pack to test it out some more. It dried and peeled my skin a lot the first 3 uses, but after that (its been 4 months) it never did that again. It may be because that particular time of use I had bad cystic acne...which brings me to my next point... I used to get bad cystic acne on my chin. Huge swollen bumps, red, shiny, the whole ordeal. Since using these wipes I have only had that ONCE since, and it has cleared up in 3 days- which is AMAZING. I use these wipes after cleaning my face before bed. I use all the product on the pads until it feels dried, though some may advise you to simply cut it in half (up to you). I use these religiously every night and my boyfriend, mom and sister have all told me they are amazed at the difference. If you are in need of a product to improve your skin, do yourself a favour and give it a shot. I would give this more than 5 stars if it was possible!"

I was desperately looking for a mask or treatment to address those dry/flaky spots AND minimize pores and treat minor acne blemishes. Oh! and softening expression lines would also be ideal. The impossible right? I tried the 5-day peel ($16) at night. Followed by DR. DENNIS GROSS SKINCARE Ferulic + Retinol Anti-Aging Moisturizer. I was amazed at the OVER NIGHT results. I woke up to a wrinkle-free, toned, clear skin. Blemishes 80% diminished (and with minimal makeup, 100% gone). To be fair, I was skeptical, at firts, because I have used both of these products in the past. Howevet, I have used the peeling wipes and the ferulic mosturizer separately, and didn't see these amazing results. I highly recommend using the peel, at night, followed with a retinol cream. Reminder: Retinol increases sun sensitivity. I cannot emphisize enough how crucial it is to wear 50+ SPF sunscreen everyday! Not only will you increases your risk of skin cancer but you will almost immediately see sun spots appearing on your face, if you skip wearing sunscreen after any retinol treatment or any peel."

This is unusual, I typically have some inflamed white-heads around my nose. I suspect it's the combination of acids in this product; Salacylic acid has helped reduce acne in the past."

I must say that I am pleasantly surprised in my overall skin health. It's a lot more radiant, even in texture and tone, and I never really had late pores to begin with, but I do notice a minimized effect as well. My main concern was always a pink flush in my cheeks, and this has basically eliminated that in about 2 weeks of continued use. At first my skin was a little sensitive the first week, but my skin has grown accustomed to it. I am now incorporating medi spa to boost my results. The only drawback about the system is that it is recommended to use daily, but its a quick session so its not too overwhelming. So happy I tried this product!!!"

I've been using the pads every or other day and I've definitely noticed that my skin is NOT breaking out, is smooth and even my pores seem smaller when I wear foundation! The pads feel like a super cleaning system that gets in there and brings everything out, which is definitely discouraging any problems with my skin from starting.

I did apply a layer of coconut oil after I let Phase 2 dry just incase the product irritated my skin, but when I woke up this morning there was no irritation or sensitivity and my skin was super soft. The redness has cleared up a bit, along with the bumps and most of the flakiness. I am really pleased by the way my skin looks and feels. I will finish the two other applications and possibly switch to the sensitive formula once finished."

I do have some sun damage and I can't say that I have noticed a difference there. I can honestly say with using these my skin looks better without makeup than with it.

I have some acne scaring on my cheeks that have darkened and just from 3 nights of using these, the spots have improved. It did sting a little bit when I first applied them (both step 1 and step 2, but step 2 stung less). I think I will try using them without the argan oil after, just to see if there is any difference. My skin seemed brighter and more even after use but there was a little peeling on my nose, so I think I will only use them twice a week. I bit my tongue buying the 30-pack, but it really is cheaper in the long run verses buying the 16-pack since you get those 5 extra to make 35.

After my first try, I could tell that my pimples were diminishing, and my skin was actually glowing. I continued using this product for next two days and my skin was totally different than 3 days ago.  I ended up canceling my facial appointment because I didn't feel a need for it, and instead, I went to Sephora store and got 60pk package. On my 4th day, I was getting burning sensation but it got better after I put on moisturizer. So I cut it down to every other day and it still works fine."

It's refining, hydrating, and potent. I have acne prone skin and I've been working hard to get rid of acne marks since I've been acne free for a few months now (hallelujah! Thank you PTR products and the Murad spot corrector). I have a few tough areas that don't want to leave just yet and one of the associates recommended I try this peel not only for reason, but others as well. This peel will refine your skin and it will be SO SMOOTH you won't be able to stop touching your face. It is surprisingly hydrating (I guess the word peel makes me think it would be drying or aggravating to dry skin at least) and leaves you glowing, I think one of my favorite things about the peel is that if you have tough blemishes that won't come to a head and just kinda live under your skin for a while (or is this just me?) this will not only bring them to the surface, but get rid of them all in the SAME use! It's mind blowing, really. I can't say enough good things about this product.  Oh - it's also safe for daily use and comes in different strengths, what's not to love!?"

My skin is oily/combination and I suffer from mild acne (at my worst I would have about 4-5 pimples and once in a while get a cystic pimple from hormones). I have only used this product one night and have immediately seen a HUGE difference in my skin. The marks have already started fading and it got rid of all but one pimple that was developing. The peel is rather strong and may cause irritation to people with dry or sensitive skin. The woman at Sephora suggested using it three nights in a row and then adjusting my use from there. The product is very expensive which is a downside, however it is definitely worth the money.

It made my face VERY red for about 4 hours after. it was baby soft though and instantly reduced pores/blackheads on my nose. I was kind of disappointed because I had read so many good reviews, even from people with sensitivities.  But...when I woke up this morning. Wow. Despite being horribly hungover (which usually makes my skin look puffy, blotchy etc.) my skin looks better than it has in months. It's smooth, even toned, not red and my pms chin zit is gone. I don't know what it did. Anything with the word peel in it usually makes my skin crawl but this worked wonders with just one use. Will definitely be trying out the 5 pack when I get paid next. Personally I wouldn't use this every day. Probably max 3 times a month, but thats mostly because daily exfoliation seems counterintuitive to me.  My skin type is pretty average combination skin with some discolouration and scarring from picking, a bit more sensitive than most and I get rosacea when I eat bad food consecutively, next time I would probably use it before bed. Would not recommend for cystic acne prone skin or anyone who is sensitive to fragrance."

They do smell very medicinal so be forewarned. I'm using the Amore pacific oil cleanser and following the serum with Josie Maran's light argan oil because I can see where they could be drying. Of course as with any retinol product be sure to wear sunscreen because your skin will be more sensitive to light. Even though it slows me down, I use them in the morning because I heard you secrete the waste products from your skin overnight so it's best to exfoliate then. I will probably buy the large pack and use every 2-3 days and then maybe go for the full week to 2 week treatment quarterly. He also makes a weekly peel that I'm going to check into.

I honestly don't even care about the price now that I've seen the results - it's worth it for me. This product is also just so convenient to use, and it definitely has made my skin feel more smooth in general, which are added bonuses.  However, I HAVE had a few pimples pop up in the last couple days, so I don't know how great it is at preventing acne.

I have never broken out like this before and the majority of the pimples are tiny dots on my cheeks and occasional jawline.

An employee there recommended this to me and I grabbed it last minute before the checkout and I am so glad I did! My skin feels softer, the acne is less flared, and I am just amazed at the results. Although it's really expensive, I think having nice skin is worth investing in. Oh yeah, the smell of step 1 is horrible..It burns my nose but at least they don't use fragrance.

My face is less bumpy and my pores seem less congested. My pores will always be somewhat congested - I've tried everything so this is just something I've accepted. However this peel seems to do what toners, astringents, and facials have not been able to do. My skin appears smoother, tighter, and more even toned and textured. Unless I find something even better, this product will enjoy a permanent place in my cabinet. I think itu2019s more effective than even prescription strength tretinoin creams, which Iu2019ve used nightly for years.  I was introduded to this peel when I was given a couple of samples at my local Sephora. If the price puts you off, ask your store for a sample and see for yourself. If not used daily (I don't suggest daily use for most people), the price is actually very reasonable. I purchased the 30 treatment pack and I anticipate that lasting approx 5 months."

I started using the peel again and in a few days my skin was back to normal...which is amazing given the environment there. This was truly a miracle and saved my skin for the rest of the trip. I highly recommend taking this with you when you travel -- anywhere. The packets make it so easy and I always make sure to have some stashed away in my travel bag."

I have had acne my whole life, I have large nose pores, uneven tone, redness, excess oil... all of it. I use a ton of products to try and control all of these things, but have never really found anything that makes my skin look better when I DON'T have make-up on, everything I'm using is basically to prepare my skin to accept make-up with open arms. But these peel wipes are very different. They dramatically changed the texture and look of my skin in just 5 days. I had gotten a free sample prior to buying this set and really liked the results so I wanted to get a week's worth and wow, so great. I definitely will keep purchasing!"

I have enlarged pores on my t-zone, uneven tone, and even some fine scaring. I have tried what feels like literally every product to make my skin presentable. I've done every skin care fad imaginable, home remedy, over-the-counter and prescription treatment. Although some have helped, nothing has ever taken care of my issues even remotely close to what I would consider acceptable. For years I have slathered on foundation every day to mask my poor skin. One night while attempting to re-order my foundation of choice I decided to browse the skin care section. I saw something about glycolic acid ( something I wasn't familiar with) and after a quick google search decided I would try it. I went in to Sephora because I wasn't sure which product to get and the sales team in the store I frequent are always amazing at helping me decide. I talked to a girl, told her what I was looking for and she recommended this product. To say I was skeptical about this product working is an understatement.. my hopes have been crushed by literally hundreds of other skincare products. I'm currently on day 12 of my two week sample and today for the first time in years I went makeup-less. My skin is glowing and beautiful. My scars, lines and dark spots have gotten about 70% better. I honestly didn't even think it was possible for my skin to look this good. Tomorrow I will be back in to purchase a full months supply! This product has literally changed my life."

After one use, skin was even toned. After two uses, skin is soft, pores are SIGNIFICANTLY smaller and the lines in my forehead have all but disappeared. More than this, my skin is radiating. I had no idea I had dull skin until I used this product and saw how beautiful it could be.  Absolutely wonderful. Use in the morning before make up and gives me longer wear and better coverage.

Today my skin looked so bad, the weight of the rash was actually pulling down some of my under eye skin -- trust me I looked horrible. I figured what did I have to lose at this point when I spied the sample on my bathroom vanity. I used the two step product which took two minutes and I was so shocked at the result I nearly passed out. Almost all of my 66 year old face wrinkles disappeared. The rash diminished by two-thirds, my face is glowing. I'm immediately put on moisturizer to be sure I didn't remove any moisture from my face -- truth be told I thnk it added moisture! My little pink rash is now flat and looks like blush. :-). I am sold on this and going to Sephora to buy some. If it worked this wel with one use, imagine what it will do with more usage!"

I have been dealing with persistent adult acne for years and have tried so many different products. Normally I wouldn't spend so much on a product like this but I was so fed up with my skin that I gave it a try. I used it on a daily basis for 30 days and was so impressed by my skin's transformation. Not only was my skin glowing and looking younger, my acne was clearing up little by little each day. The peels even cleared up my acne scars, leaving me with the most even skin tone I have had in years.  While this product is really expensive, you might find that it helps you save on other beauty costs. For example, since my skin is so clear now I rarely wear foundation anymore. And since I don't need multiple, expensive skin care products anymore, I now just use a $10 drug store facial cleanser.  I wouldn't say this product is some kind of magical, miracle-worker since I still find myself getting the occasional pimple here and there. But this is the closest thing to skin care magic that I've ever found. And if you're like me and have been dealing with unrelenting adult acne for as long as I have, you'll probably agree that the occasional pimple here and there is a small price to pay for overall gorgeous skin."

The treatments lasted me a long time since I was cutting the towelettes since I only needed it for a small area. I wish I loved this , it was so simple and easy to use. The smell wasn't horrible nor did it break me out it just didn't do what I hoped it would do."

Applying foundation, BB cream or liquid highlighter in those areas was hard. It didn't look good. I also was experiencing more blemishes than ever. A lot of black heads in my chin and cheeks and they were leaving red blemishes. My chin looked so horrible.  I've bought so many treatments looking for a solution! I even went to the dermatologist, even though I don't have acne or anything, but when she prescribed antibiotics for 3 months everyday.... no thanks.  For some reason this treatment didn't grab my attention for a long time... I think it was just the wipes, towelettes form. Also because it was a peel. It scared me.  After getting tired of my uneven texture, I once again started my research. I decided to see the reviews of this product since they were so amazing. After reading them, I decided that I needed to try it. I went to my local Sephora and bought the 5 treatment box.  WOW! I don't remember feeling and seeing my skin this way since... well I don't remember. The uneven texture is gone. It didn't dry my dry skin, which was my biggest concern.  I used it before bed. Didn't put anything else on my skin after the treatment, just in case to prevent a bad reaction and to see how it really worked on my skin by itself. In the morning my skin looked beautiful. It is soft, glowing, tight, and the best thing... it didn't dry my face! It looked just as if I applied a moisturizer before bed.  Yes, it tingles. BUT it's not like you feel like your face is burning. This is a peel, and for what I've read they are strong. The tingling disappears in a couple of minutes. Believe me. I'm very cautious with what I use in my face.  I think one of the best uses for this product is to use it when your skin is looking dull and you have something important that night or the next day. LIFESAVER for those situations.  I will DEFINITELY buy this again. Yes it is expensive but I don't plan to use it every day. I think that once a week is enough, or maybe two if needed. I also think it is better to use at night so your skin can absorb everything and breath for a couple of hours.  Also, just because this peel worked for me I'm not going to try others. Be careful with what you put on your skin. A bad peel can really damage your skin."

I just got finished with both steps a few minutes ago, and while I know it's too early to fully judge the product, I will say the results I'm seeing after just this first use far exceeded my expectations. My skin looks much brighter, my pores do look slightly diminished and my overall complexion just looks better... I'll have to wait and see how it does with the dark spots I have from the breakouts I've been experiencing lately, and if the product dries out my skin or any other adverse side effects, but the visible difference in my skin with this one trial is just the pick me up my complexion needed and I'm hoping it only gets better with further use..."

It wasn't until this past year that I found myself unhappy with my skin, as working in a harsh environment and dealing with some health issues began changing my features. Texture was unpleasant, my skin was dull, my pores had gotten quite large in areas, and I'd been dealing with more acne and blackheads than I ever have. After two weeks of use I notice I'm glowing again. I've noticed some pore minimization, my acne is less prominent and my blackheads are nearly gone, which was one of the issues bothering me the most. My skin looks and feels a little more plump and my skin tone is a little more even. Most of my fine lines are around my eyes, but the much less noticeable smile lines I had are pretty much diminished. I'm still pretty oily, which may have something to do with my hot and steamy work environment, but I can deal with that. These pads are easy to use and although they tingle quite a bit in some areas I haven't become red or irritated from using them and my skin hasn't dried out at all. I use them in the morning and they don't seem to affect make up application at all. It's an expensive product, but if it can do all the jobs of a bunch of expensive creams and serums I think it's worth it. I've tried a few creams and serums without noticing any differences so it's fair to say I'm happy with the results from this product so far."

It has not broken me out once, it has not irritated me. I have very dry flakey skin around my forehead. I was sure that this product (and the extra strength formula) would dry me out further. It's the opposite! No more flakey forehead.  I had a deep-set wrinkle on my cheek due to major acne scarring, as well as a few acne scars around my face. They are gone. The deep set wrinkle that I've had for years and years is gone. I can't believe it. Pretty much all my acne scars are gone. Any discolouration I had on my face - gone. Fine lines - gone.  The most notable change is in the size of my pores. Even my husband has noticed. I used to have large pores on my nose that were a pain to control and on my cheeks. Now I just have small pores on my nose and barely noticeable pores on my cheeks. It's unbelievable how well this product worked for me.  It's perfect.

I had a really bad reaction on my chin and cheek area a couple of months ago and the redness and spots weren't attractive on a pale complexion like mine. I was extremely nervous to try a peel but it was so gentle and left my face baby soft. After 3 uses in a 4 day span my boyfriend commented on how glowy my skin looked and how my redspots were less noticeable. That is great news to my ears, knowing that this man hardly notices anything I put on my face. I am sold on this peel. I will be heading back to Sephora to purchase the 30 day supply."

I vowed to never revisit this product. Years later, I got another sample, and tried it again in the correct order. I tend to put things under my eyes to rid myself of the fine lines that appeared years ago. Nothing much worked aside from a mask I found recently. This too, worked to buff out the lines underneath my right eye, and a laugh line slowly appearing on the left. Guess what? 1 week from using this, and those lines are still diminished. If you feel a bit daring to carefully try this under your eyes (I don't recommend it, my skin is like rock and rarely irritated by anything other than Proactiv and this when I did it backwards) then I hope it works for others like it did me. This is something I will purchase in the future!"

You could say my entire face was scarred in my early twenties.  I took photos of my skin when I started, and looking back I am always amazed (and slightly mortified that I let my skin get so bad.)  It's now over a year that I've been buying the extra strength (started with the regular), and my scarring is 70% less. It actually looks decent.

But I had recently purchased a few things on the website and a sample of this was an offer at the time, so I thought to myself well I'll give it a try.  At this point, finding something a little bit pricey felt like my only option. I had done everything to keep my skin staying as youthful and clean as possible. Over the counter/ grocery store cleansers did nothing for my skin. My issue has never been pimples actually surfacing but having very clogged and enlarged pores. So, when I received this product, as well as fresh- soy cleanser (another one I had discovered via sampling) I saw immediate results. I am going to buy the bigger package and hope to the lords that my body doesn't adapt to it quickly due to the fact that this is like the miracle product I have been waiting to find.  My pores not only got smaller, but all the clogging and dirt was prevented after using it as well, between both products, left my face bright and absolutely refreshed. I have never felt so clean and silky! I also purchased Tarte Pure Maracuja Oil ( I bought the roller ball size for starters, but I had heard nothing but amazing things about the product. Once this is all used up I am going to purchase the larger one as well) and I would apply that about 5-10 minutes after doing my face peel. That definitely helped moisturize my skin, OVER NIGHT. Overall, between all three products I feel that clogged pores, blemishes and redness do not stand a chance.  Although the cleanser and oil have made a significant difference. I have broken out on my chin, and of course after I ran out of my samples of this product. I think a lot of it is owed to this. Tomorrow I have to go to the mall to purchase some things and this will be one of them!"

Ok, so I'm still in my twenties and see this as a preventative maintenance investment, but the difference in my skin tone and texture is remarkable! No makeup needed, and I get more compliments now than ever. HUGE confidence booster!  How I use it: Integrated into my morning routine, I wash my face in the shower and pat it dry prior to applying Step 1 in a circular motion until the product is no longer on the pad. Wait a couple of minutes (I use this time to apply body lotion or do other quick tasks) and apply Step 2 - again, circular motion until the product is completely used up. Let your face rest and apply makeup once face is dry (if needed, but I find makeup is not necessary).  As for discomfort, the first few applications would be rated as minimal for me. There was a slight stinging, but it was completely tolerable and short-lived. Now that I'm used to this being a part of my daily routine, I don't even think about it.  This product is worth a try. Weeks later, I'm STILL seeing additional results through younger looking skin and radiance. If you don't love it, you never have to buy it again - but you're totally going to love it."

I've tried just about everything, the most drastic of which was Accutane, which cleared my skin for a while but the side effects were so awful I had to quit it. Out of all the treatments I've suffered through, the only thing that has ever really changed my skin was eating healthy (funny, because my derm insists diet doesn't affect acne. Ha!). Anyway, though my skin isn't horrible, it's still bad enough to really drag down my confidence. I'm lucky to have finally mastered foundation application, which actually makes my skin look almost normal, but that isn't a solution to the problem! I bought these in the hopes that they'd even out my skin tone a little and maybe even help with the scarring. I've used four pads so far, and am impressed (wish I had taken before and after pictures!). It's not an overnight cure, but it has definitely reduced redness, flattened raised pimples, and given my skin a certain glow. Now, some other reviewers mentioned that this product worked great for a week or so, then they broke out horribly. I think it's worth mentioning that after my second night of using this, there's a very small cluster of pimples on the upper right of my forehead (which is why I deducted a star from the rating). I know this is what did it because I NEVER break out on my forehead, only my jawline, chin, and cheeks. But, other than that, my skin has showed no other signs of irritation, only improvement. In fact, this has proven gentle enough for me so use every night instead of every other day. I will definitely do a follow up review in a couple weeks or so (either here or on the extra strength version). But for now, I can say that I'm happy with the purchase!"

Honestly, I expected them to burn and itch and irritate me.  Within an hour of trying these, my boyfriend (who didn't know I had tried something new) told me that my skin suddenly looked much better than it had looked in weeks! It was clean, fresh, glowing, exfoliated, not overly dry or oily. These are great, I am so glad I tried these, what a great, unexpected find!! Definitely worth trying!!"

I go to the spa at least once a month for a chemical peel so the tingle feeling is normal. This product is easy to use and feels nice, the cloth is not rough and does not feel like sand paper. I do recommend at least once a week with the combination of masks. After using the peel my skin feels VERY clean and you can feel that it has removes all the dead skin cells.

I've tried hundreds of different products and finally just accepted that I have bad skin. UNTIL! I received this sample.. there were 3 treatments, but I found the cloths to be quite large, so I cut them in half and made 6 treatments. I wiped over clean skin, added my moisturizer, and went to bed not expecting much; however noticed that my skin felt very nice immediately. My skin looked INCREDIBLE the next morning! The dry patches and blemishes alike were reduced! The best part? I used it every other day, and my skin continued to clear and become more radiant. I've noticed that when I run out, my skin slowly starts to lose that clear radiance that this product provides... always making me come back for more. Yes, it's expensive, but if you've suffered with horrible skin, you're willing to spend the extra for such an incredible fix!  Also, it's worth mentioning, I bought this item as listed above, and I received 5 bonus Extra Strength wipes too!"

And now Im starting to notice a difference in both the tone of my skin (it was quite uneven), my blackheads are starting to improve (first time a product has helped in this arena), and my skin used to be patchy with some flaky areas and some oil slick areas. Im noticing those are evening out as well.  I can recommend these enough. BUY THEM! You wont regret it.  P.S. SMALL NOTE ABOUT THE EXTRA STRENGTH VERSION They came with a 5 day sample supply of the extra strength ones but by the end of the 5 days I noticed a slight bit of discomfort and dryness with using them. But like I said earlier, my skin is pretty much virgin in regards to any real skin care/treatment, so I think they were just a little strong for a brand new beginner like me."

Because I have clear and moderately even skin, I don't use these every day (Plus their expensive!)

I'd tried using retin-A prescribed by my dermatologist, but it was way too harsh and left my cheeks raw for months. I just figured I was destined to have bad skin forever. Until my dear cousin gave me a sample box of these wonderful little packets. It's the best thing I've done for my skin--it's never looked this radiant. I only use them 3x a week to save some $$ but I plan to use them as long as I can!"

That said, I think it's worth every penny. Pricey, yes, but it makes an immediate and significant difference and is very easy to use. I've found that the extra strength version used every other day helps to stretch the budget without a noticeable difference in results. I highly recommend this product."

Further, I have fair skin and mild sun damage which I have actually noticed getting better from the ingredients from this product, nice little unexpected side affect!  I would buy the packet of 30 but if your skin is sensitive like mine, you only need to use a pad once every few days to get the same results without drying out the skin."

There were 3 treatments, but I found the cloths to be quite large, so I cut them in half and made 6 treatments. I wiped over clean skin, added my moisturizer, and went to bed not expecting much; however noticed that my skin felt very nice immediately. My skin looked INCREDIBLE the next morning! The dry patches and blemishes a like were reduced! The best part? I used it every other day, and my skin continued to clear and become more radiant. Since I've run out, my skin has maintained this healthy glow! I will definitely be purchasing this... it's expensive, but if you've suffered with horrible skin, you're willing to spend the extra for such an incredible fix!"

When I finished the sample box of 3, I wanted to get the full size product but it's so expensive for alpha hydroxy! Luckily for all of us, they also sell these in travel packs of 5 peels for $15!!! which is great for a quick pick me up every other month when your skin isn't looking its best."
