Not sure about rating a product as bad just because it is slightly smaller, when I look for reviews I want to know how a product is, but i digress."

Their response? unfortunately we don't have access to this information. This was kind of off-putting for someone who's a long term customer. It's getting hard to justify $49 CAD for 2 oz less, as 8oz was already not enough product for the price. I'd say wait for the gift sets and value sets around the holiday season- this is when they have more bang for your buck. Just something to be aware of ud83dudc4d"

            "review_text": "I was so excited to see this product back since it's one of my absolute favorite body moisturizers - the vanilla apricot scent on my current original one is incredible. But after seeing that the standard size is now 2oz less than the original (from 8oz to 6oz, albeit for $2 less), there's really no way I can justify the cost now. Nearly $40 for a body butter was already a lot but the fact that it's that much less product now, it feels ridiculous."
