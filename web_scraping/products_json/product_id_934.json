Serum, primer, moisturizer etc I have to literally wear nothing under this product or it ballls up and flakes off very badly"

I have been using Teint Idole for a few weeks and am SO happy and impressed with it. here's what I love.  No Sweating/beading: I tend to sweat a lot from my face, and unfortunately most tinted moisturizers with SPF tend to run right off of my face, leaving me vulnerable to the sun. This AMAZING formula locks into place, without feeling heavy, and does not sweat off or bead up on me. On that fact alone I am sold.  Formula: I love the pleasant light scent of this foundation, and as someone with fragrance sensitivity it causes me no problems. And even though it's matte, it looks natural on my skin, not chalky or cakey like mattes tend to do.  Color matching: I tried 345N and it's a great match for my tan, golden peachy skin tone. Also, as someone who has trouble reading tiny print, I LOVE that they add a little sticker on the back of the bottle with the color number code.   Overall, I am really pleased with this foundation. It makes my skin look nicer, while not sweating or running off, and has SPF, which I absolutely want to ensure I have on me. This one is joining the rotation and I will purchase when it runs out!"

I put it on in the morning, and it still looks fresh by the evening without needing to touch it up. It also has a natural matte finish that looks smooth but not dry, so my skin looks polished but not shiny. Itu2019s very easy to apply, whether I use a brush, sponge, or even my fingers. I just need a small amount to cover my whole face, so the bottle lasts a long time, which makes it worth the price. The color range is fantastic, so itu2019s easy to find a perfect match for my skin tone.

I like the fact that it has SPF 15. Not that I rely on foundation for sun protection, but I'll take any extra protection. Despite being advertised as a matte foundation, I like the natural finish it provides. It has good coverage and sets on my skin after application. Overall it has the potential to be a great foundation, if you can find your perfect match."

I normally wear a skin tint or Mac Studio face and body foundation since I can't stand the heavy feeling of a foundation or the make-up'y look of it but I like to have more coverage for certain occasions. I was pleasantly surprised that I can get medium coverage and long wear with Lancome Teint Idole Ultra Wear foundation without any of the negatives, so thank you Bzz Agent for the free product. I wore it to a dance class and it stayed and kept my face natural rather than shiny looking through it as well as several hours later without touchups. Love the beautiful glass bottle, which feels solid and looks great on my bathroom countertop. Pump works well, too, and doesn't spew out too much product. It did make my pores look more noticeable, which is why I gave this foundation 4 and not 5 stars, so a good primer and skin prep are essential before using it. For reference, I have normal to slightly dry aging olive light medium skin with neutral undertones and 330N was a near perfect match for me."

Iu2019m super impatient and canu2019t handle makeup that I have to sit there and blend for a while to get a seamless look. It leaves my skin matte, but not dry or tight feeling.

Per the pictures you can see that I chose the wrong color, however the description of the foundation color was for my type of skin color. Which is rosy red.....  I thought it looked dark in the bottle, and as you can see by the pictures below, it doesn't look natural on me.  I had to put it on my neck and chest area . Then my arms were still red. Hahaha    I did look at other shades of the foundation on the sephora.com website, and it seems there are a few different shades that might work with similar descriptions.   There is 245c is for light/medium skintones with cool/rosy skin undertones and 320c is for medium skin with cool/rosy undertones   The product itself is lovely. I mixed mine with a little bit of my moisturizer and it went on like a dream. It does last a good portion of the day. I sweat alot on my forehead, It stayed on. A+ for me. It doesn't smell like sunscreen. A+ for me.  I looked at the ingredients and WOW! I don't know if any of them were good? If your skin reacts to alcohol then this one isnt for you.    Outside of the shade not matching me. I love the product. It has good coverage, as you can see below in the pictures that it covered my rosy red skin.   What do you think about the shade on me?  I'm not really a fan. Lol   If you are interested in this and you've never used it. I suggest going into Sephora and get matched with their little device that they hold up to your face and it chooses a shade to try. I dont know the name of the device. Lol  I hope this helps anyone struggling to pick a shade. I know I did and it still wasn't the right one. Lol  Ladies, have a great day!"

My favorite days to wear this foundation is when I want minimal makeup. I can use this foundation, a little concealer, mascara, and lipgloss and look so put together for work zoom calls. The glass bottle is slim, attractive, and does not take up much room in my makeup bag. As far as longevity goes, it stays on a lot longer during the colder months on my semi oily skin. However, I still wear it on warm days, when I do not need to have it on for longer than six hours, and have it wear down beautifully. Overall, I think this foundation continues to be a cult favorite and I see myself repurchasing it in the future."

This is the first time I have tried a Lancu00f4me product and was skeptical about trying it since my normal foundation changed formula and began drying out my skin and sinking into my fine lines - I thought maybe it's my skin's new normal.  I was pleasantly surprised when I tried this product, and happy with the coverage.  The product is thin, but buildable. With it being thin, it does not feel heavy and I was able to wear it for a full day without feeling like I was wearing makeup.  The wear time was also fantastic and there was no need to reapply or touch up.  I also found that it did not sink into my fine lines like my other foundation.  I will say, it looked better with my Mattifying primer than my Hydrating primer, so make sure your primer has the same base as the foundation. The color was spectacular, and I'm happy to have find a shade that blends easily with my olive like complexion (with sun spots and redness of cheeks).  Upon removal, it removed easily leaving behind no residue or clogged pores.  The only con is the price, as it is not as budget friendly as the typical super market foundations. I would definitely recommend this to a friend, and an now interested in trying other Lancu00f4me products."

I am normal to dry on the perimeter of me face with an oily t zone, after about 8+ hours of wear (no setting spray) I did notice it was sinking into lines and fading around my nostrils.

My preferred way to use it is still mixed with a little bit of a tinted moisturizer to just give it a little more of a natural look, but again, that's because of my personal skin issues.

I think that that is critical for wrinkle prevention, and having that included in my foundation is so convenient.  CON: The only con I noticed, an reason I gave it only 4 stars is that at the end of the night when I went to go remove my makeup, I noticed it some cracking and lines in the area under my eyes. It seems it did not hold up as I was expecting it too. I did use a primer before hand and also used a setting spray after applying.  Overall, I would recommend this product for shorter durations rather than longer ones. I would not use this for a photosoot for example. I would certainly use it for every day short period usage."

From its packaging it is quite an experience, its box is beautiful and its reliefs give an elegant touch to the packaging, the container or packaging is of quality, it looks resistant and what I liked is its applicator, it manages to give you enough quantity without wasting product when referring to the formula I have to say that I liked its coverage is very good, it feels light on your skin and I love it, I am fascinated that my skin looked as if it had a filter, I felt pretty, it left my skin even and it is very useful for me to protect me against the sun, it is a product that I would buy and recommend, what I advise is that when using it prepare your skin well so that the product has its maximum benefit on your skin, I was delighted with this foundation, compared to others that I use both high-end and pharmacy, it gives me everything, easy application, coverage, sun protection, and more. I am very amazed at how good it is and how beautiful it makes me feel because of how my skin looks. The inflatable one will be the new favorite in my makeup bag."

The color was a little light but will work perfect in the wintertime. It is very lightweight and honestly went on like butter. It has buildable coverage but I will say I am not convinced it's 24 hr wear. I feel like compared to Estee Lauder Double wear it doesn't quite match on the longivity of the application. But it is still a nice foundation that I would consider rebuying. It does not feel cakey nor does it break me out. A little also goes a long way. I will say it is not quite hydrating so if you have a more dry skin it may sit more on that than help. Overall I was very happy with it and will continue to use it."

When it arrived I noticed that there was an additional label stuck on the bottle. It's meant to replace the original expiration date. I don't think this was a good move, especially without any explanation to potential customers that the product was going to be sent to. So I decided to try it on my hand first to see if there were any adverse effects. The color was perfect, but I intentionally applied it to dry skin to see how the foundation would hold up. It made the dry textured skin appear more textured, so the drying combination skinned need to be hyper aware of this. I love that it blends beautifully, and has a buildable coverage. It's lightweight and that's ideal for me. I started to look for more lightweight formulas as I've gotten older, wanting the no-makeup makeup look. The color was a perfect match, but I noticed that there weren't a ton of options available. It doesn't oxidize, but when it begins to dry down the color darkens and neutralizes just a bit. The texture feels really nice to the touch and didn't transfer easily."

This foundation is matte but feels light on my skin and breathable. I also seem to have a little bit of a glow from within appearance while wearing. Typically my I am combo/oily. My skin doesn't get oily while wearing this and I am able to touch my face hours later without transfer. I used a tacky primer and a brush to apply. Using that combo seems to really work for me. Pressing the foundation with the brush into face keeps me from using too much and also allows me to build it up if needed. I am also impressed with the coverage. A tiny bit handles redness concerns and adding more will cover blemishes. As for longevity, I have worn this several times in a humid Florida climate and at the end of the day there's no visible separation or other issues. As with anything matte though I will always recommend a good skincare prep. Overall I would definitely recommend and plan to purchase more when I run out!"

Iu2019ve been looking forward to applying this every single day. Iu2019m so ready to invest in this every time I run out. I definitely recommend it to those who want to feel good about themselves to try it out. I donu2019t even need to set this, and honestly, I donu2019t even need concealer either. The bottle is absolutely gorgeous! The hyaluronic acid and vitamin E really make a huge difference. I noticed it doesnu2019t set into my fine lines, which is a huge win for me. The full coverage it provides covers my uneven skin tone and problematic areas like magic. I canu2019t stop raving about this enough. Lancu00f4me, you got yourself a true winner with this one!"

Even though I typically like a more dewy finish, I found myself constantly reaching for this one because the coverage was unmatched and it just feels so nice in my skin. When I have dry patches, you can definitely see them, so hydration is key. When I was a more dewy look, just layer on a highlighter.

However, my nose area is always tricky, and this foundation didnu2019t quite work thereu2014it settled into my pores and made the whole area look flaky. To be fair, almost no foundation works well with my nose!  I think I probably need to hydrate better beforehand, especially around my nose. Since my primer is water-based, I skipped it the first time using the foundation, and it felt a bit too dry for me. Next time, Iu2019ll try it with a silicone-based primer to see if that helps with the dryness and flakiness.  On a positive note, the color match is spot on for my Northeast Asian skin tone, which I appreciated. Iu2019ll experiment with the primer and better hydration, but so far, itu2019s a solid foundation with potential if you prep your skin well!

Texture is an issue for me, and I was impressed by how this formula sits on the skin without clinging to things Iu2019d rather blur out. I will say that this shade, for a neutral, pulled significantly warmer than I was hoping for, which on the one hand is great for counteracting the pinkness/redness in my cheeks, but doesnu2019t blend too ideally when it meets the extra fair skin on my neck.  I havenu2019t been reaching for it in my day to day, for work or play, but at night time it makes for a fantastic base for when Iu2019d like a heavier handed look. That being said, I tend to go for a less is more approach in my daily makeup wearing routine. Iu2019d be interested in trying to find a better shade match, but worried the other options for a very fair neutral might pull a little too cool.

While it might be out of my usual price range, I truly appreciate the free sample I received. It allowed me to test it out before committing to a purchase.

But when I'm going out and want something that will last me all day and into the evening, I switch over to full coverage foundations.  This foundation by Lancome is the only one I've tried so far that does not look cakey at all on my skin and also does such a great job with coverage that I feel like I don't need to use any concealer.  Within the makeup influencer communities on Youtube and Tiktok, I feel like this foundation is greatly overlooked.  I don't see myself going back to the Nars foundation after trying this one out."

Finish & Coverage: The foundation offers a beautiful natural matte finish that doesnu2019t look flat or cakey. It provides excellent buildable coverage, effortlessly evening out my skin tone while still allowing my natural skin to shine through. I love that I can wear it light for day looks or build it up for more coverage during the evenings.  Longevity: One of the standout features of this foundation is its staying power. It lasts all day without fading or settling into fine lines, even in humid conditions. Iu2019ve gone through long days and still looked fresh by evening, which is a huge plus for me.  Texture: The texture is lightweight and smooth, making it easy to blend. Whether I apply it with a brush or a sponge, it glides on effortlessly and doesn't feel heavy on the skin.  Shade Match: Shade 335W is a perfect match for my warm undertones. It doesnu2019t oxidize throughout the day, which is often a concern for me with other foundations. The range of shades available is impressive, catering to various skin tones.  Skin Compatibility: I have combination skin, and Iu2019ve experienced no breakouts or irritation while using this foundation. It has a lovely oil-control feature without being overly drying.  Overall Impression: The Lancu00f4me Teint Idole Ultra Wear Foundation in 335W is a fantastic investment for anyone looking for a reliable, long-lasting foundation that delivers on coverage and finish. Itu2019s suitable for both everyday wear and special occasions. Highly recommended!"

It has a medium to full coverage that I have found to be buildable depending on what look you are trying to achieve. I used a beauty blender to apply and I think that it has a really nice finish with that as opposed to applying with my fingers. The only reason that I gave it 4 stars is because in my experience, the longevity of the wear isn't as long as I was hoping for. It is not as sweat proof around my forehead as I was hoping for. Honestly, if you are looking for an all in 1 foundation that has sunscreen, this is a fantastic product!"

The 510N shade was a perfect match for my African-American complexion, which can be challenging to find, so that was a pleasant surprise.The foundation has a silky texture and blends seamlessly over my serums and moisturizers. I put it to the ultimate test during a vacation to Florida theme parks and was impressed with how well it held up against the heat, humidity, and even after water rides. The product truly lives up to its claims of being long-lasting and resilient.I love how buildable this foundation is; I can achieve maximum coverage under my eyes with a brush, and then use a damp beauty sponge for a smooth, medium coverage across the rest of my face. It doesnu2019t flake or settle into fine lines, and the finish is so natural that no one could tell I was wearing makeup. Overall, I appreciate the versatility of this foundationu2014itu2019s now a staple in my makeup routine."

I applied it early in the morning before work, and by the end of the day, it still looked fresh. Even in high humidity and during a workout, it held up incredibly well without becoming patchy. I can confidently say that it can easily go the full 24 hours if needed. What sets this foundation apart from others is its lightweight, breathable feel. My skin didnu2019t feel clogged or suffocated at all, which is often a problem with long-wear foundations. It almost feels like a second skin, allowing my complexion to breathe while still providing full coverage. This is great for everyday use, especially for people with sensitive or acne-prone skin like mine. It offers medium-to-full coverage, which is buildable. Whether youu2019re going for a natural, light look or full glam, it does the job without feeling heavy. The finish is a lovely satin-matte, balancing between a natural glow and a shine-free look. It blurs imperfections, covers redness, and leaves your skin looking smooth and flawless. I have combination skin, and this foundation worked wonders for me. My oily T-zone didnu2019t break through during the day, and my dry patches around the cheeks remained hydrated without any cakiness. From my experience, it seems suitable for both dry and oily skin types. This 24-hour breathable foundation is a game-changer!"

This is really beautiful foundation. I have a hard time matching my fair skin, and this matched so well! I would say this is medium coverage and buildable. It looks so nice on the skin (like my own but better) and does not feel heavy at all. It has no weird flaking or clinging to certain areas like other foundations Iu2019ve recently tried. I wore it all day while out and about in 70 degree weather, and it looked great all day. Iu2019m dinging this one star because it has chemical sunscreen in it, and I avoid chemical sunscreen because itu2019s absorbed into your bloodstream. If this had only mineral sunscreen, I would absolutely give it five stars. If you donu2019t mind chemical sunscreen then I highly recommend trying this foundation!

Firstly, Iu2019m 56yo with skin that acts like it doesnu2019t know that itu2019s menopausal. I have very few wrinkles and my skin is oil/combo and foundations made for more u201cmatureu201d skin break me out.    The shade range is impressive and quite inclusive . The color I received to try was 510N which was a bit more natural than I would selected but, it still blended seamlessly with my complexion, which can often be a challenge as Iu2019m neutral/warm.  The undertones are well thought out, catering to all tones so thereu2019s a good chance youu2019ll find a shade and undertone that works for you. Typically, foundation with SPF added does not bode well on melanated  complexions and can come off looking grey. That was not the case with this formula as it wore beautifully. I wore it on a long 12 hour workday and the formula really held up throughout the day.  It is lightweight , didnu2019t look like a mask and blends like a second skin, which is always my concern with full-coverage foundations. My oiliness did break through after about 4 hours, but nothing a blotting sheet couldnu2019t handle.   Would I buy this again, most definitely. The beautiful wear, added SPF, and extensive shade ranges and undertones make this a solid choice without having to jump at every new foundation release."

            "review_text": "I recently tried the 320C Teint Idole Ultra Wear Foundation by Lancu00f4me, and I must say, it has quickly become a favorite in my makeup routine.  Firstly, the shade 320C is a perfect match for my skin tone, providing a beautiful, natural finish that blends seamlessly. The consistency of the foundation is smooth and lightweight, making it easy to apply. Whether using a brush or a beauty sponge, it glides on effortlessly without feeling heavy or cakey.  One of the standout features of this foundation is its long-wear formula. It claims to last for up to 24 hours, and I was pleasantly surprised to find that it held up remarkably well throughout the day, even in warmer weather. There was minimal fading or settling into fine lines, which is a huge plus.  Another benefit is its buildable coverage. I found it easy to achieve a sheer, natural look for a daytime outing, but it also layers beautifully for a more full-coverage finish when needed. Plus, it has a nice matte finish that helps control shine without looking flat or dull.  Overall, the 320C Teint Idole Ultra Wear Foundation offers excellent coverage, longevity, and a stunning finish. If youu2019re looking for a reliable foundation that can take you from day to night, I highly recommend giving this one a try!"

The 135 neutral tone seemed more of a match; however, it was a tad too dark. I am somewhere in between these shades. I went to the Lancu00f4me counter, and it was difficult to get a good match.

The formula glides on smoothly, offering a flawless finish that feels lightweight on the skin. The coverage is buildable, allowing me to achieve everything from a natural look to a more polished appearance for special occasions. One downside I encountered was that I picked a shade that ended up being a few tones too dark for my skin. While the shade range is extensive and caters to various undertones, itu2019s essential to be sure of your shade before purchasing. Despite the color mismatch, the foundation wore beautifully after mixing it. The foundation quality is great, just be sure of your shade."

Unfortunately, after testing the product on my actual face my opinion varied.  letu2019s begin with the shade range; disappointing and falsely advertised. immediately when i applied it to my face i found the shade to be grey, but after testing another color, it did get a little better. this is concerning as i had to go much darker than originally intended, meaning the darkest shades are likely not dark enough. the first foundation shade was another concern, leading me to believe that the undertones of this foundation are off/grey, which specifically stood out o me as a black woman.  The foundation texture was silky and beautiful; it blended with much ease, but it personally made me look cakey at first. the coverage is not truly matte or entirely buildable, more so lightweight with a satin finish; i found i could only get a medium coverage after layering. this foundation definitely was natural looking and felt weightless on the skin; when initially applied, i looked like i had little product on my face and it felt very breathable, but as i finished my routine i found myself looking more cakey with the foundation pilling around the forehead area.  the wear on this foundation is the best thing it has to offer; as i went through my day it settled more into my skin and looked significantly better, losing the initial textured appearance. This foundation lasted through hours of wear and had minimal to no transfer throughout the day; i took a long nap in this foundation and woke up without any transfer and my my face was flawless. i was also able to wipe mascara off of my face without disturbing the foundation in any way. as someone with watery eyes, i had tears run down my face that left no impression on the foundation.  overall, the foundation was okay; nothing life changing. at this price point, you can find better at the drugstore."

With my regular skin prep / primer routine I think my skin looked beautiful with this foundation. It evened everything out. It did not emphasize any dry patches or enlarge my pores. It didn't look too cakey. And it lasted my 8 hour work day looking great. I finished my look with powder and I think that helped keep my shininess levels down. Would definitely recommend."

I own the Teint Idole Ultra Wear All Over Concealer - love it so much, I convinced 2 other family members to buy it. And now, I've finally had the chance to try this Ultra 24H Long Wear Matte Foundation (for free - in exchange for my honest review)! It's no surprise at all that this product quickly made its way into my daily makeup routine, replacing another brand of liquid foundation I've used faithfully since the summer of 2019. u2728ufe0f  Pros: - Medium, buildable coverage. Paired with the matching concealer, (or even without it) this foundation does an amazing job of covering up any dark spots or blemishes you may have. - Weightless feeling on the skin. No matter how much coverage you apply, you won't end up with that caked on look. It goes on so smoothly and is as light as a feather. - Beautiful, uniform matte finish (without being dry) thanks to the added sunscreen, morgina, vitamin E, and hyaluronic acid. - Over 40+ different shades available. You will certainly find your perfect match just like I did - mine is shade #510N. Lancu00f4me, you rock for being so inclusive!!  Cons: -I tried hard, but couldn't think of one.  I would and do 100% recommend this foundation, as well as the other products within the Teint Idole line. It's a must have!"

This foundation provides excellent full coverage without feeling heavy or cakey on the skin, which is perfect for my combination skin type.  Pros:  Long-lasting wear: I wore it for a full 12-hour day, and it held up beautifully without any touch-ups. No shine, no fading! Matte but not drying: It gives a soft matte finish that doesn't look flat or dry, which is a common issue Iu2019ve had with other matte foundations. My skin still feels breathable. Buildable coverage: A little goes a long way! I can easily build it from medium to full coverage depending on the occasion, but it never looks cakey. Great for oily/combination skin: I have combination skin, and this foundation keeps my T-zone shine-free while still feeling comfortable on the rest of my face. Wide range of shades: The shade Medium is a perfect match for my skin tone with neutral undertones. Cons:  Price: Itu2019s a bit on the higher side, but honestly, you get what you pay for in terms of quality and longevity. If you're looking for a foundation that gives you a flawless matte finish and lasts all day, this one is worth every penny. Highly recommend! ud83dudc84u2728"

I wore it for the first time going to a wedding and people kept complimenting me on my skin... I thought wearing it to a wedding would also be the perfect test because I usually remain on the dance floor and it did not budge while sweating. At the end of the night, I still looked amazing. It's so light that I now just put a little on with my face cream on days I don't want to go full faced and it makes me feel so much better.

I also love how it settles into a matte finish (though I did notice some shine on my T-zone by the end of the day) It's not overly greasy, but I did have to blot a little, so Iu2019d recommend it for those with combination or oily skin to keep that in mind.  The only downside was the shade I pickedu2014250Wu2014 it unfortunately pulled a little more yellow/orange than I expected. I typically lean towards neutral or slightly warm tones, but this shade didnu2019t quite match my skinu2019s undertone as Iu2019d hoped. It was a bit too warm, but it still worked in a pinch when blended carefully.  Despite the slight shine in my T-zone and the mismatch in the shade, I do think this foundation delivers a stunning finish thatu2019s hard to beat, especially for those looking for long-lasting, full coverage with a flawless appearance.

I did a full 8 hour work shift plus took my kids to their sports and still looked good. It didnu2019t separate or look shiny. Truly my new favorite foundation, not saying it because it was free for me. I honestly love this, and that it has sunscreen protection in it as well."

Hereu2019s a casual review of the Lancu00f4me Teint Idole Ultra 24H Long Wear Matte Foundation:  ---  **Lancu00f4me Teint Idole Ultra 24H Long Wear Matte Foundation Review**  Hey there, beauty lovers! Letu2019s dive into one of my recent favorites: the Lancu00f4me Teint Idole Ultra 24H Long Wear Matte Foundation. If youu2019re on the hunt for a foundation that can keep up with your busy lifestyle while giving you that flawless finish, this one might just be your new best friend.  First off, letu2019s talk about the packaging. It comes in a sleek glass bottle with a pump, which is always a win for me. The pump makes it super easy to dispense just the right amount of product without any mess. Plus, it feels pretty luxe sitting on your vanity!  Now, onto the formula. This foundation has a lightweight feel but provides full coverage, which is a hard combo to find! It glides on smoothly and blends effortlessly into the skin, making it easy to achieve that airbrushed look. Iu2019ve tried it with different primers and moisturizers, and it just plays well with everything.   The finish? Absolute matte perfection! It gives you that soft, velvety look without being flat or dull. I have combination skin, and I often struggle with areas getting shiny throughout the day, but this foundation really holds up. Iu2019ve worn it for long hoursu2014think a full workday or a night outu2014and it stayed put without needing to touch up too much.   One of the standout features is its impressive longevity. The u201c24Hu201d claim definitely holds up in my experience. Whether I was running errands or hitting the dance floor, it didnu2019t fade or oxidize. It also feels comfortable on the skin, so you wonu2019t feel like youu2019re wearing a mask.  Now, letu2019s chat about the shade range. Lancu00f4me really nailed it here; they offer a wide variety of shades to suit different skin tones. I appreciated how easy it was to find my match, which isnu2019t always the case with other brands.  This is a must have!!"

            "review_text": "I'm not a big fan of matte foundations due to the fact that it made my skin feel congested and I wanted to remove it immediately. I'm not mad at this foundation. I've worn this foundation for a week so here are my thoughts. Starting with the packaging, which I love. The glass is heavy & though I don't plan on dropping this to test its durability, it looks like it would survive an accidental drop on the floor (just don't do it!) It comes in a pump (after you remove the cap) which I appreciate. I only used one pump of the foundation, which it wasn't watery, it was slightly thicker, but not like a cream. It covered all of my face and some of my neck. At first I used my fingers and the foundation spread smoothly. It covered most of my redness, more so than one of my current foundations, but texture will always be there for me. Then I used a damp sponge to blend lightly. This is more of a medium to full coverage for me, even with one pump. It matched my skin tone and I didn't see any oxidation after it settled. It doesn't accentuate any fine lines & it didn't settle in my pores too much. I didn't use any powder as it was matte on my moisturized skin. After testing it on cold and hot/humid days, it did stay on even on hot humid days, but my face ends up a bit shiny at the end of the day. I will say that it didn't oxidize at the end of the day but on certain days, it did make my skin feel slightly tight, even with moisturized skin. If you have dry skin, you may not love this. Overall, this is a good product for normal, oily, or combo skin. Sensitive skin folks should test it first. I have sensitive skin, and it didn't bother me as much (only on days when it was cold it felt itchy but not bad). Would I buy it again? No, but I do recommend for medium to full coverage. I like light to medium coverage. I do tend to feel the foundation on my skin at the end of the day though, which I'm not liking. Overall, this foundation is nice on hot humid days because it does last all day."

I have been using a tinted moisturizer plus concealer in place of foundation for a few years since I couldn't find a foundation like this. I am 44 and my skin has different needs than when I was younger, so I felt like foundation was too thick and drying for my skin, and blocked my pores. This product changed my mind. It checks all the boxes for me, it's very light and breathable but still provides natural looking coverage, and it lasts all day, even covering my dark under eye circles. I wore it daily for a week to make sure my skin didn't react to it, and I have had no issues. No dry patches, breakouts or redness. It doesn't dry out my skin, and doesn't look cakey when I apply bronzer or blush over it."

It has a very thin consistency which makes it easy to apply in ultra thin layers. Thin layers allow you to control the level of coverage and for a daytime look, I enjoy a natural, light to medium coverage. You couldnu2019t tell that I was wearing any foundation at all aside from how even my skin tone looked. Itu2019s supposed to be a matte finish but I think it looked radiant with almost a satin-like finish for me. As someone who is dry and not oily that may be a concern for my oily friends.  The other thing I really liked was that it has sunscreen in it but doesnu2019t have that overwhelming sunscreen chemical scent that you find in a lot of foundations with sunscreen. It was much more pleasant experience and wear for me because of the mild scent which went away after only a few minutes.  Lastly it blended very beautifully with cream products and didnu2019t lift during any application of powders. Overall, itu2019s a winner for me especially as an every day, natural-looking almost u201cno makeupu201d makeup foundation."

It glides over my skin with a foundation buffing brush or a beauty blender, and has light to medium but buildable coverage. It still allows for my freckles to show underneath and I love that (but knowing I could use more to cover up). I do have to say the shade is perfect for my fall skin tone when I apply a light amount (my tan is starting to fade), but I would need to purchase a different shade if I were to have a heavier application, so thatu2019s something to note. I do have dimple lines that any foundation settles into over time, and this foundation isnu2019t exempt. Nothing a bit of setting powder canu2019t fix though! I havenu2019t broken out since using it, and I have very sensitive skin - so thatu2019s MAJOR for me. The packaging is sleek and easy to fit into any bag for on the go.

Plus on days I'm running late or forget sunscreen, some protection is better than none.  The only downside is the shade match is a bit off. Some brands say neutral and the foundation is warm but Lancome is definitely true to shade/undertone. 320C is way too pink for me. When I get the right shade for me this will definitely be my go-to daily foundation. It's light enough to wear everyday and in the hot SoCal weather, but I can also see it working during the cooler seasons for those with oily skin. It has good build able coverage and plays well with other skincare/makeup products.  Overall very impressed and happy with this foundation!"

As someone with combination skin living in a humid climate, I found that it performed quite well during the hotter days when my skin was more oily. The foundation provides excellent coverage and has a matte finish that helps control oil, which is a definite plus. Compared to other foundations I've tried, the Teint Idole Ultra Wear stands out for its long-lasting formula and ability to withstand humidity. It kept my skin looking fresh while I was at home. However, Iu2019ve also experienced separation and clinging to dry patches when I traveled to a drier climate. This inconsistency makes it less versatile than some other foundations I've used . One of the main benefits is its impressive coverage and durability, making it ideal for summer days. The packaging is also convenient and travel-friendly. Additionally, it has a good range of shades, ensuring that most skin tones can find a suitable match. While I appreciate its performance in humid conditions, Iu2019m not sure I would repurchase it as my go-to foundation. The issues I encountered in drier environments make me hesitant, as I prefer a foundation that can perform consistently. I would recommend the Teint Idole Ultra Wear Foundation to friends or family with oily skin."

I must say, I was highly impressed with its performance, especially on my oily skin. One of the first things that stood out to me was that it did not cause any breakouts, which has been an issue with other foundations containing SPF in the past. The foundation provides a smooth, medium coverage that feels incredibly lightweight on the skin. It's so light, in fact, that just one pump is sufficient to cover my entire face without the need for additional layers, giving a natural look without feeling overly heavy.  Unlike other full-coverage foundations, like the Estee Lauder Double Wear, which tends to feel quite weighty and uncomfortable after a few hours, the Teint Idole Ultra Wear sets to a soft matte finish that feels remarkably weightless and pleasant on the skin. I particularly appreciate its color match, natural finish, and lightweight feel, making it a standout product.  Moreover, it held up exceptionally well throughout the day, even on my oily skin, without requiring frequent touch-ups. This long-wearing capability is a significant plus, especially for those with oily skin or anyone struggling to find their perfect shade. I highly recommend the Lancu00f4me Teint Idole Ultra Wear Foundation to anyone seeking a comfortable, natural-looking, and long-lasting foundation."

I also like how this foundation has a bit of SPF in it to give the skin on my face a little extra protection. For the most part it lasts the whole day for me.

It creates a flawless yet genuine look by balancing out my tone and highlighting my natural texture.Impressively, the oil control prevents shine without irritating my skin.

I don't use primer and have been using the same skincare products the last few months. My skin is just super problematic lol. Sometimes matte foundations makes my skin look dry as it is overly matte. This foundation provides a soft/satin matte finish and swear it still gives my skin that hydration it needs without becoming greasy. Better yet.....I can achieve the same beautiful finish every day which makes it easy to put on in the mornings when rushing around getting ready for work. I still do get some shine that peaks around the 4 hour mark, but it looks more of a glow rather than grease. I also have acne-prone skin at the young age of 40 and haven't had any problems with breakouts! It does have a slight perfume scent but dissipates quickly. I was fortunate enough to receive this product from BzzAgent and provide honest reviews."

The coverage is controllable and you can build however much you need. It covered my imperfections very well, leaves a matte finish on skin and controls oily skin (at least mine) perfectly.  Now I can't make the claim It will last 24 hours because who keeps makeup on their face that long? Lol. But I will say after 9+ hours of wear, my skin still looked flawless.

Setting spray/no spray, setting powder/no powder, prior skin care routine and none) so I could gauge the difference and longevity of the wear. Feels very thin when applying but has great buildable coverage without feeling cakey. Stays matte through the day which is amazing in the southern heat. Absolutely love and have found an upgrade to my current foundation."

I have a lot a freckles which I like to keep visible, and a bit of redness around my nose and chin which I like to cover, and I felt this foundation did a good job at doing both.

This truly does wear so light it doesnu2019t feel like foundation on the skin and it is easy to build for desired coverage level. I have combo skin and was worried it would be patchy on drier areas, but it wore beautifully even at a baseball game sitting in direct sunlight for an hour. I love that itu2019s fragrance free and buildable, but my favorite is they have truly improved the shade selection for more olive skin tones like mine. I noticed immediately it compared to past experiences with the brand where I just could not fit the right undertones. So glad I got to get reintroduced to this product."

Pros: love the pump, very easy to dispense, only need 2 pumps to cover the whole face, good coverage and it is buildable, no fragrance Cons: it did not wear evenly, by the end of the day I had caking and areas around my nose that had worn off, could definitely tell I was wearing a foundation (which is fine if it is even and beautiful!)  I used a foundation brush first which seemed to go on well but did not wear evenly.  The next couple of times I used a beauty blender and that was much better.  Still didn't wear well.

It doesnu2019t have a thick goopy feel and leave your makeup feeling and looking heavy. This shade 310 N is a little light for me but I find that if I mix it with a drop or two of another darker foundation, itu2019s perfect. It mixed well.

The photo is of me with about 1.5 pumps on my face. I'm also impressed with how it stays throughout the day and still maintains that glowy, natural look. I really love for my makeup to also have skincare in it so this just hits all the boxes with the hyaluronic acid.  I was initially worried that the color I picked (330N) would be too grey for me but it seems pretty perfect.

Firstly, the coverage is phenomenal. It provides a flawless, full-coverage finish that still looks natural. The formula is lightweight and breathable, which is crucial for everyday wear, especially in Florida's humid climate. I found that it didn't clog my pores or cause any breakouts, which is a huge plus for my sensitive skin.  What impressed me the most was its staying power. This foundation truly lives up to its ultra wear claim. It lasted all day without fading or requiring touch-ups, even during a busy day that included preparing for a hurricane. The matte finish kept shine at bay, and I appreciated not having to worry about my makeup melting off in the heat.  Additionally, the shade range is extensive, making it easier to find a perfect match for my skin tone. The formula also blends seamlessly, creating an even, smooth complexion.  Overall, Lancu00f4me Teint Idole Ultra Wear Foundation is a top-notch product. It's perfect for anyone looking for reliable, long-lasting coverage that maintains a natural look.

I love that it has buildable coverage. It's definitely not too heavy and I can even show off my freckles unless I want to build upon the coverage. I can't believe just how long this foundation has held up. I've tested it out for a full day and even worn it to bed to see how it holds up for 24 hours of wear. When I woke up with the makeup still on, my skin was still covered and the foundation held up. I have to say that I also have been able to go for hours without needing to touch up with powder, which is honestly fairly shocking for me because I definitely have issues with oily skin and shine in my T-zone. It's not uncommon for me to need to touch up with powder only an hour after first applying some makeup, but I've been able to go for over 4 hours without feeling like I was very shiny with this foundation. My biggest issue is that I think it's just too thin and runny. I applied this product using a foundation brush and then again with a sponge, and I found it to be quite liquidy and just seeped down into the brush and sponge. I know it's supposed to be a thin and breathable foundation, but I just found it to be a touch too thin and prefer foundations that are a little thicker and hold up with a little more consistency on a brush or sponge as I'm applying the product. I felt like I had to go back and add a little more to my brush just to get the right coverage because it was too thin. Overall, I think this is a great foundation that absolutely holds up for long-term wear with just the right level of coverage."

It glides onto your skin so easily and the coverage level is just perfect! Doesn't leave me shiny or looking oily, and doesn't give a caked on look either.

I prefer to use a blender to apply it. You need to use very little to achieve full coverage. Because of this, I need to start with a really small amount.   I ordered the 225N, which I felt was a little tiny bit too peachy for me, but it still blended in well.  When I looked at the range, I was pleasantly surprised to see such a wide range of shades and would recommend getting samples or going into the store to get a perfect match.   As a note, I do think it's a little drying, most likely due to the matte effect of it. This wasn't too important for me, but it might be something to consider if you have dry skin. For me, it works best if I'm using a hydrating moisturizer before make-up.   Overall, I like that itu2019s super lightweight, and when it dries it doesn't feel heavy on your skin. It lasted throughout the work day and caused me no issues or touch-ups."

I tested the Lancu00f4me Teint Idole Ultra Wear Foundation alongside my usual daytime skincare routine, which includes vitamin C, moisturizer, and sunscreenu2014because, realistically, thatu2019s what I apply daily before my makeup. The foundation claims to have a matte finish, but with my skincare underneath, the result was more of a natural, healthy finish, which I didnu2019t mind. Day 1: On the first day, I didnu2019t set the foundation with any powder. Initially, it looked flawless, and I was pleased to find the shade matched me perfectly. However, around the 6-hour mark, I started noticing it settling into my smile lines, with oil breaking throughu2014particularly in my T-zone. By the 8-hour check-in, my face had become very oily, and the foundation was starting to smudge and break down. Day 2: On the second day, I decided to set it with powder and finish with a setting spray. The makeup looked beautiful again at first, and I was optimistic. At the 8-hour mark, the foundation had settled into my smile lines but much less than on Day 1. There was also less breaking around my nose, though it still wasnu2019t perfect. Final Thoughts: Despite Lancu00f4meu2019s claim of a 24-hour wear, I found that it struggled to hold up throughout my typical workday (7 AM - 5 PM). By the end of the day, the oiliness was too much, and the foundation started to wear off, particularly around my T-zone. Honestly, the finish and wearability are comparable to a drugstore foundation that Iu2019ve been usingu2014and for the price, Iu2019d rather stick with the drugstore option. However, the right powder and setting spray will aid in the longevity if you still want to make this foundation work."

It has a nice natural matte finish, not too dry or powdery looking and doesn't emphasize dry areas. Overall, I really like this foundation and will continue using it when I wear a full make-up look. The only negative is the formula seems to be a little thicker and harder to spread than some other foundations I have tried, but that could be due to my dry skin or my application technique."

It is a little heavier than Iu2019m used to wearing. I use La roche-posay tinted mineral sunscreen and this is much more of a foundation than that. So if youu2019re looking for full coverage+sunscreen this would be a great option.  As I did the rest of my makeup it did seem to blend more into my skin better. I would approach with less is more and build if more is needed.

I'll be the first to admit I have really oily skin that doesnu2019t fare well in Texas heat. My skin is prone to breakouts, with some acne spots, and can be picky with new products. So, when I got the chance to review this foundation, I was worried my skin would break out. However, Iu2019m happy to report that wasnu2019t the case!  It had been a few months since I used liquid foundation because of the heat, but I decided to apply it before a late-night concert. Using a sponge, I noticed it took a couple of layers to cover my acne spots, but the foundation was buildable. While the first layer was a bit light, smoothing it out gave me the coverage I needed.  Now, remember how I mentioned I live in Texas? This foundation seemed to take that as a challenge! The foundation stayed in place after a concert, drinks, and walking in downtown humidity. I did sweat, but that didnu2019t affect its appearance. I didnu2019t need to reapply or add powder, and it didnu2019t look oily afterward. Shocked is an understatement.  Another big plus? My skin didnu2019t feel suffocated or dry. After about 30 minutes, it felt like I wasnu2019t wearing any makeup at all. Iu2019ve worn it a few more times, and my verdict remains the same: I may have finally found a foundation that works in this heat!"

Itu2019s easy to build for more coverage or use sparingly for a subtle, smoothing effect.    u2022   As I remembered, it has a strong u201cperfume-likeu201d scent, which doesnu2019t feel particularly clean or natural.    u2022   It worked very well with my oily skin, keeping a natural matte finish even after all-day wear in the Miami heat.    u2022   I didnu2019t need to use any setting powder, which was a plus!    u2022   However, it didnu2019t play nicely with my cream blush when applied over it. The best method was applying the cream blush first, then lightly tapping the foundation on top. Powder blush worked much better.    u2022   While the finish looked great throughout the day, my skin felt drier than usual. I needed a finishing spray to add moisture and had to reapply it multiple times.  Overall, this foundation is definitely an improvement from the Lancu00f4me formulas Iu2019ve used in the pastu2014lighter and fresher. However, it didnu2019t feel as hydrating or natural as Iu2019m used to now. Itu2019s a solid choice for oily skin, but maybe a bit too effective in keeping the shine away!"

The Lancu00f4me foundation had many shades and while it looked good overall when I applied powder over parts it seemed like it didnu2019t dry down a lot and the powder kind of stuck to it.

I have normal/dry skin, normally matte foundations do not work for me but this one is not drying at all and very comfortable to wear, because this is a natural matte with Hyaluronic Acid it looks so smooth on the skin and I feel like Iu2019m wearing something thatu2019s actually good for my skin."

My other issue is that this didnu2019t provide a lot of coverage and even when I tried building it, there were spots that never really felt as covered as others and it looked uneven. When I used this foundation a few years ago I was very happy with it so I am kind of shocked at how bad this was, and usually Lancome is relatively reliable but the quality in this is very questionable.

I was impressed that this is the case since this is marketed to be towards the matte side. - I really enjoy the consistency of this foundation. It has great coverage but is not extremely thick. It spreads easily and does not leave my face feeling like Iu2019m wearing tons of makeup.  Cons: - I do believe that this foundation oxidized on me a little bit. While it was minimal compared to other foundations Iu2019ve tried, itu2019s worth mentioning. I do not like to wear setting powders, so you may be able to prevent that by setting the foundation."

The first time I applied it, I used way too much. It has a matte finish, but I have been obsessed with cream products lately and my cream blush, bronzer, and highlighter applied over it like a dream. I only used setting powder on my t-zone where I am oily.   This truly lasts all day. I was so impressed that my skin still looked flawless at the end of the day. When working from home, I prefer a lighter, more dewy CC Cream, but I needed a great going out foundation, and this is definitely it.   I have attached a before and after photo."

Sometimes it's normal to oily (in the summer time) and sometimes it is normal to dry (colder, winter months). Finding the right makeup can be tricky at times.  Lancu00f4me is a brand that is worth paying more for and this foundation is no exception. In my opinion, it is leaps and bounds better than any of the drugstore brands that I have tried.  The 215C (fair with cool pink undertones) was a perfect match for my somewhat pale skin tone. It blended easily and seamlessly. You couldn't tell the difference between the areas where makeup was applied and where it wasn't. Definitely impressed!  I always apply a good quality primer before applying my foundation. It went on smoothly and didn't settle into any fine lines or pores. I didn't have to use a ton of the foundation to achieve my desired look. I do NOT like the overdone, caked on makeup look. I prefer something more natural so it's important that I don't end up looking clown like or like I'm applying face paint. I think this has a true medium coverage. I was very pleased with the somewhat glowy finish and end results.  It held up VERY well throughout the day. I have worn the makeup even when I was working outside and sweating a lot! I didn't notice any fading or changes from when I first applied my foundation in the morning from when I removed it in the evening. It does rub off on my sunglasses when I wear them so I normally have to fix my makeup after removing them!"

The tint is a bit off for my skin tone; while it claims to be universal, it didnu2019t blend as seamlessly as I hoped. I found that it left a slight cast, which is not ideal for daily wear. Additionally, the finish tends to be a bit greasy, which doesnu2019t mesh well with my usual makeup routine. I prefer a matte finish, so I ended up having to apply a powder on top to reduce shine.  Overall, while this SPF does provide effective sun protection, the color match and finish could use improvement.

If you have oily skin and need something that won't slide of your skin, this is a great foundation. I will keep using it on days when I need my makeup to last longer.

It also covers the redness that I sometimes get on my cheeks. Those are the pros. Unfortunately, this product makes my skin look dry and bumpy, even when it isn't dry or bumpy. And, after only a few hours of wear, it separates quite a bit. This happens regardless of which primer I use, or how much setting spray or powder i use. I've tried various products along with this one, trying to find the magic combination. I have definitely tried worse foundations, but I've also tried better. I will keep this on my shelf as an emergency backup, for now."

I did not have any patchy spots or spots where the foundations slid around or came off.

Very natural look, not oily, not sticky, however more on a dry side, I would recommend using moisturizer prior to application. I love that it's unscented and not noticeable at all, but would prefer more coverage. I did use high-density brush for application, maybe applying by hand or with a sponge would give more coverage. It has 25 SPF sunscreen, which is a bonus. Doesn't smudge or stain clothes. Definitely a matte finish, and the shade was absolutely perfect, exact match for my skin.

Both my 25 year old niece and I have been using it and enjoying it. The texture is a lovely gel that spreads evenly. I would call the finish skin-like, it's neither matte nor glowy. I have not noticed any transferability during the day. The longevity is excellent. There is no scent, which is also a plus. This has sunscreen, which I dislike because I always wear sunscreen as part of my skincare. Overall just a really solid, everyday foundation from an excellent brand."

The Teint Idole Ultra 24H Long Wear Matte Foundation is a new favorite that I will definitely be purchasing in the future. Most matte foundations are drying and do not compliment my dark skin tone. This foundation successfully created the matte look I'd been wanting, without appearing dry or cakey. It is incredibly light and flexible, allowing for a full night of smiling and laughing without the annoying foundation creases around the eye and mouth areas. I wore this foundation, with primer, to an event that had an indoor and outdoor social area. My face was flawless throughout the night, after approximately 6 hours of smiling, laughing and talking in both the outdoor and indoor spaces. The color match, coverage, and longevity factors of this foundation each deserve their own 5 stars! I definitely recommend this purchase."

Also, it doesnu2019t break me out, which is always a concern with long-wear products, especially for those with sensitive or acne-prone skin.  However, there are a few areas where it could improve. First, while the foundation performs well in controlling shine, it can cling to dry patches if you have combination skin, especially during colder months. I find that using a hydrating primer helps, but without it, the product can exaggerate texture in drier areas. Additionally, though the formula is long-wearing, after about 8 hours of wear, I noticed slight separation around the nose and mouth, especially if youu2019re sweating or wearing a mask.  Lastly, while the shade range is good, the undertones can be tricky. Some shades lean too yellow or pink, making it hard to find a neutral match, especially for those with neutral undertones."

I have olive skin and shades never truly match me. I just have to get close but it will either be too orange or too light until this! Iu2019m obsessed with the shade and then when I came on the website I see they specifically worked on the olive shades and I feel so seen! I kept taking pictures of my neck because usually no matter how much I blend it just is not the right color and I have to blend it down my entire neck in order to not have an obvious difference in my face and neck! I also wore it to work and then took this picture after so it really is truly long wearing. Lastly I HATE when foundations FEEL like you are wearing foundation and this one felt super breathable! Love it."

Definitely live up to its name of breathable foundation. Another plus is the bottle looks luxurious, feel sturdy with a frosted look and pop gold cap. Looks good on the vanity.

While it is more matte than what I would typically go for, I still had a nice glow with it.

With so many foundation choices out there, Iu2019d never tried one from Lancu00f4me before. My first impression was that they offer a really impressive shade range. I have fair-light skin with aggressively neutral undertones. Most foundations are too warm or too cool for me, but I was able to pin down the perfect shade (097N) using the photos and swatches provided online. The consistency of foundation was a little surprising. It has a slightly oily, thin consistency that dries with a natural semi-matte finish. I didnu2019t need much to get a light level of coverage (which is my preference) and it seems buildable, but I do wonder if it would look a little heavy if I used much more. The only downside of the oil-like consistency is that it magnifies any dry patches/flaky spots, so prepping skin with a good moisturizer first is essential!"

I am very happy that this product was sent to me to try in exchange for a review, because I would have never otherwise experienced how great it is!  I keep my morning routine very simple, moisturizer, SPF, and aloe vera gel for primer before foundation, but since this one has SPF included, I have been able to skip that extra step (I use powdered SPF for touch-ups during the day). This foundation goes on easily and blends well, and I haven't noticed any creasing. I use setting powder out of habit, but could see some users having the ability to skip that step if they aren't very oily. The finish is quite matte but doesn't feel or look crusty. It actually looks very natural, but could be built up for a more flawless finish if that's your preference.  I have combination/oily skin, so for foundation, the real test for me is longevity. Without going into too much detail, I had an emergency one day after using this foundation, which ended in me not doing any touch ups, and I even neglected to remove my makeup before bed. Sleeping in foundation is a guarantee that I will wake up with angry skin, or so I thought. My sensitive skin showed no signs of irritation the next morning, which was pleasantly surprising!   I would like to add that I haven't used chemical-based SPF in a few months, as it has made my skin break out in the past. Even after sleeping in it, I did not experience any breakouts.  Overall, I would recommend this to anyone who has a compatible skin type. If you're considering giving it a go, I would say it is worth it!"

One pump is enough to get a beautiful medium satiny finish. If I wanted it heavier, I could have used a little more. I was nervous it would be too matte (super matte foundations scare me) and I really don't find it to be the early 2010s matte dry look and found this to be more radiant to me. I would describe the finish as looking like my skin but more even and blurred. So far it is also very longwearing (on par with like an estee lauder double wear imo without being as heavy) This will definitely be added to my foundation rotation - I will definitely replace it when I run out!"

I can say that this has absolutely replaced my previous foundation. The benefits of this product are so noticeable within the first week of wearing. I live in the Northern United States where the weather is variable this time of year and you can be sweating one day and freezing the next. My skin has remained hydrated wearing this foundation and on the hot days the Teint Idole foundation has not melted off when sweating and does not transfer to my clothes! This is HUGE! Not having to switch my outfit or wash shirts right away because of foundation on the collar. This shade matches my skin so well and it feels thin and breathable- two things that are a MUST for me with foundation. It is buildable for full coverage or a more natural look but either application look so natural on me, it doesn't look like I'm wearing makeup at all. There is also no scent which I appreciate and my skin has been really happy with this product, as some other products typically will cause breakouts or sensitivity.

It blends beautifully, provides the perfect coverage, and stays out for my full 12 hour makeup wearing day. Would definitely recommend. Just make sure to get color matched, so that you get the right shade. Then it will be perfect! Im picky when it comes to foundation.

My skin is pretty decent and I don't like feeling like I'm wearing a mask. My regular go-to makeup look is nothing. Barring that mascara and concealer because I have very dark undereyes. Concealer, however, is hard to find because it cakes and doesn't cover that well but since I'm only really using it in one area (and rarely bother with makeup anyway) I never cared.  I received this product for free and I thought why not try it. I absolutely would not give an opinion that wasn't facts regardless of that because I am not generally a fan of incentivized (read: inflated) reviews, but y'all...I used this in place of my concealer and I look AMAZING. I'm 41 and I swear this took 10 years off my face. Undereye circles are covered perfectly, but more amazingly? You can't tell I'm wearing makeup. AT ALL. It is perfectly smooth and blended to look and feel like nothing. As a non-makeup person I cannot tell you how much I appreciate this! I will 100% wear this daily. I love it. I have never felt this way about a foundation before. All I've ever wanted was something that covers the dark circles and otherwise looks like I'm wearing nothing. Apparently that was too much to ask...until now.  The sunscreen is nice a bonus."

First off, the coverage is flawless. I noticed how effortlessly it blended into my skin. A thin, pigmented fluid that is buildable without feeling heavy and never cakey. It offers a breathable feel while still providing excellent buildable coverage. It evened out my complexion beautifully, and I felt like it improved the overall appearance of my skin throughout the day. I was able to achieve a flawless look without it feeling heavy or cakey on my skin. Whether I wanted a light layer for everyday wear or a more polished finish for an evening out, it delivered beautifully.  One of the standout features for me is how well it held up throughout the day. With my oily combination skin, I often struggle to find foundations that last, but this one stayed put without transferring. I didnu2019t even need to set it with powder, which is a huge plus! It felt lightweight and comfortable, allowing my skin to breathe.  Another bonus is the SPF 25, giving me added protection without feeling greasy or overly drying. Overall, the Lancu00f4me Teint Idole Ultra Wear 24H Foundation will become a staple in my makeup routine. If youu2019re looking for a long-lasting, breathable foundation that works well on oily skin, I highly recommend giving this a try!"

I also appreciate that it comes in a wide range of shades, making it easier to find a perfect match for different skin tone  Overall, if youu2019re looking for a foundation that lasts all day, gives you a flawless finish, and feels comfortable, I highly recommend Lancu00f4me Teint Idole.

Compared to other high-end brands I've tried, this one strikes the perfect balance between full coverage and a natural finish. It feels light on the skin but still manages to give me that flawless look without feeling heavy or cakey.  Why I Love It:  - Long-lasting wear: It lasts all day, even when I'm running around after the kids. No need for touch-ups! - Perfect match: The shade 525W is a lovely warm tone that blends perfectly with my skin, which can be a struggle to find for deeper skin tones. - Non-greasy finish: I tend to get shiny throughout the day, but this foundation gives me a matte finish without drying out my skin.  Would I Buy It Again? Absolutely! It's now my top choice for both everyday wear and special occasions.  Would I Recommend It? Definitely. I've already shared my love for it with a few friends, and I'd recommend it to anyone in need of a long-lasting foundation that provides great coverage and feels comfortable."

I've gotten a solid 10 hours, and any additional is not bad, but just not perfect. But really, you need to do all sorts of work to make any foundation last that long. I have normal skin (but dry these days due to it getting colder). I do 2 pumps and apply 2 thin layers with a fluffy foundation brush, and going back in with a denser brush on areas that need more coverage. It sits SUPER naturally on my skin. I could probably go a shade darker if I didn't contour and blush. I'm a C4 at MAC and it's a perfect UNDERtone match. I don't know if I'll repurchase for $57, but we'll see. I can see this lasting for at least 4-6 months, with using it 3-4x a week. Also important to note, even though this is a silicone based foundation, I felt like it sat better with a water based primer. Meaning, when used with a primer that's more of that slippery feel, it pilled, but maybe I didn't wait long enough. I have had better experience WITHOUT any primer at all, just a regular moisturizer (again, wait til its fully dry). Just like with any other foundation, exfoliating and removing any dead/dry skin is key, especially for a matte foundation where it's going to more easily show the dryness."

Having sunscreen in the formula is also a plus! My skin usually has a negative effect to SPF and this didnu2019t cause any problems. I could see this as being too drying for those with dry skin, as the foundation is very mattifying. I found that a little bit really goes a long way, and the coverage is truly buildable.

Just my usual primer as a base and the Lancome foundation.  I'm pretty pleased by how well the 130C fit my skintone. I don't feel like it washed me out or was too dark. Another plus is that it has SPF in it, which is a must have for fair skin like mine. It didn't completly cover my freckles and hyperpigmentation, but it seriously put in some work. I can definitely see the difference. It doesn't feel too heavy on my face, I feel like the final look could have been better overall had I used other products but again, I wanted to show you all how the product looks without compromising it with other products.  I included a before and after for you all, no filter, natural lighting."

It doesnu2019t highlight dry patches or flakiness, which is a big plus for me. The coverage is quite full, but it still looks natural on the skin u2014 no mask-like effect. As an experiment, I applied it on my hand over a brow pencil, and it covered it really well, showing great coverage power.  Another bonus u2014 the foundation doesnu2019t oxidize or turn yellow or orange throughout the day. I usually set it with a translucent powder, which helps it last longer. I wore it for about 10 hours, and during that time, it didnu2019t smudge or transfer onto my clothes or tissues.  I hope it doesnu2019t cause breakouts since my skin can sometimes react to new products, but so far, so good!

            "review_text": "Thank you to Lancome for the free product in exchange for this review. This foundation in 400W is a true medium with warm undertones that was a decent match for my tan skin. The consistency is runny but not watery or serum-like; it was easy to spread with my fingers, a dense brush or beauty sponge, depending on how much coverage I was looking for, which makes this more versatile than the other foundations in my collection. As someone with combination skin, I thought this wore OK on my dry areas but looked much better on my oily T-zone. I prefer a medium coverage foundation, and rely on concealer to deal with dark spots or blemishes, and it was easy to build this up without looking too heavy. Of course, powdering helped this foundation wear longer, but that meant having a really glam look that I would only ever wear when I want to look flawless in photos. I'd recommend this foundation to anyone looking for a foundation that works well on slightly oily skin, provides more than just sheer coverage (i.e., can be layered for a more flawless complexion) and wears solidly for about 6 hours before fading."

With the previous bottle, because it was very budge proof and once something successfully budged it it was impossible to blend back in. Once I got more comfortable with it this actually became what I liked most about it. With the previous formula I could apply just a little and it would stay all day and not break down. I didn't need to powder or prime, it was one step. It would even look better as time went on and my oils mixed with it. It was also the best color match I had ever found.  The new formula is beautiful on the skin right away on application. If I had tried it first before being used to the old formula I might have loved it. It's not budge proof and moves around a low-mid amount through the day. Isn't matte, more like a natural finish, so on my oily skin it doesn't look as good at the end of the day as the previous stuff. It probably needs powder but the previous bottle didn't. It also has a thinner consistency and is easier to apply then the previous formula. It also has more skin loving ingredients which I appreciate. However the new color is a shade darker than my previous bottle which was the most disappointing...   I like it, I'll use it up, but I probably won't repurchase."

Iu2019m extremely picky and nothing impresses me so I had lower expectations. I wore this foundation for a few days around 8 to 9 hours and all I can say itu2019s a wonderful formula with medium to full buildable coverage. I used it with the YSL primer and they worked really well together. The finish is natural not too matte and you definitely donu2019t feel something setting on your skin. I didnu2019t notice any emphasized texture or pores, but I had to use blotting sheets on my nose after a few hours of wear which is OK. However, this is not Transfer proof :( although I set it with powder and setting spray! So this is some thing Iu2019m not truly happy about, because when a foundation is not, Transfer proof it means that everything I apply on top of it is going to move around throughout the wear time.  I hope they improve this, for the meantime I will finish the bottle and I will go back to my Esther Lauder foundation."

It's soo hard for me to find a shade and when it comes to quizzes it's like, the color picked is always either like my same color or off, I know most of you are thinking duh.. that's the point to get the same exact color of your skin but that's NOT what I want, like I specifically prefer to look a bit tanner then I am, as it just looks, well, better.. it still matches my body as my face seems to be one of the lightest parts of my body as I try to keep it protected from getting burnt, also at 35 almost 35 almost 36 in July, I'm noticing a really HUGE and multiple diff. Changes with my skin... things I never thought or imagined or knew anything about and kind of still don't as far as like my forehead having started to well ill put it like this it looks like I went to the beach got burnt, pealed, some of the burn turned to tan and now my foreheads blotchy like 2 diff colors ud83dude1e I've been trying to figure it out & from what I've researched it's Hyperpigmentation  and normal for my age.. but this is one of the reasons I also look for a VERY ALIGHTLY tanner foundation.  And I cNt beleive I literally found it and SO EASILY! I love how it blends making all my skin perfectly one color which gives me so much confidence back, it doesn't crease in my fine lines like my forehead creases from make that face like excuse me???? (With sass) ud83dude09 you know those creases right above your nose the horizontal ones!! I KNOW I'm not thee only one with them. Anyhow, I digress I'm just so over joked that I found an AMAZING and buildable and comoletley perfect match my FIRST try, it lasts me all day unlike others I eaily sweat off when working or make creases this foundation is TOP TIER lightweight, not cakey, feels good on your skin, and literally gives you a totally new view on your day I put it on and can go from feeling like zero to hero real quick haha. Total confidence booster I highly highly recommend."

This product has buildable coverage and despite being listed as a matte foundation, I found that I was able to manipulate the finish depending on how I prepped/set the face! I have combo skin but prefer to have a more natural finish so I was glad to see that it was breathable and not too drying. I can see where it could look heavy in some areas but on a positive note it does set down well. Worked well with my current routine and all my usual products layered nicely ontop. The shade I received (240W) is a little dark/yellow for me at the moment, but I am very excited to see it match better in the summer when my olive skintone deepens. I still prefer something a little more skin like and thinner but I will be reaching for this when I need my makeup to be locked in and not budge on hot days!"

Overall though, I think this foundation is worth a purchase because for a matte foundation it didn't feel dry on the skin at all. My skin still felt refreshed and hydrated. For the summer months I think this foundation could work great since its matte and it won't melt right off your face from the heat."

As someone with combination dry skin, finding a foundation that blends seamlessly and doesnu2019t emphasize dry patches can be quite a challenge. This foundation, however, blends like an absolute dream.  One of my biggest concerns with long-wear matte foundations is that they can often look cakey or cling to dry areas, but the Teint Idole Ultra exceeded my expectations. It provided a flawless finish without looking heavy or textured. My skin looked radiant and healthy, yet not overly shiny or greasy, which is a perfect balance for my combination skin.  The staying power of this foundation is also impressive. It lasted throughout the day without the need for touch-ups, maintaining its fresh, natural look. The coverage is buildable, allowing me to customize it to my needs, whether I want a more natural look or full coverage for a night out.  In summary, the Teint Idole Ultra 24H Long Wear Matte Foundation has quickly become a staple in my makeup routine. It offers a beautiful, blendable finish that doesn't compromise on comfort or longevity, making it a fantastic choice for anyone with combination dry skin. I highly recommend giving it a try!"

Lancu00f4me is a trusted beauty brand and they put years of research into creating makeup formulations. Lancu00f4me Teint Idole Ultra Wear is their newest matte foundation. It offers a 24hr wear time and although I didnu2019t wear it that long it, certainly lasted throughout my 12hr days of work and errands. I also liked that it was a natural matte that still allowed me to look like myself and not like a mask. One of my favorite things about this product is that it is buildable. I think one pump can be spread from the center of the face outwards for a tint-like effect and you can add extra pumps depending on coverage needs. This is perfect for the days you only want to hide some t-zone shine. Even with one pump I was able to diminish redness and some hyperpigmentation. A nice thing about Teint Idole Ultra Wear is the extensive shade range featuring deep and olive friendly shades. Marine blue allows for deeper shades while chromium green is used for olive tones. I use the shade 240W and would say it a pretty solid match. Sometimes I think it looks slightly pink, so I do wonder if Lancu00f4meu2019s u201cWu201d tones have some cool tones added but overall itu2019s a good match."

It smooths out my skin, and leaved it flawless. When I do start to get oily, all I need is a quick powder touch up and it's good as new.

Having been a loyal user of Dual Finish Powder Foundation for many years, I was hesitant to switch to a liquid foundation. However, from the moment I tried the Teint Idole Ultra Wear Foundation, I was absolutely blown away. The lightweight yet full coverage formula allowed me to achieve a flawless and natural look that I had never experienced before.   One of the most impressive aspects of this foundation is its blend-ability and buildable coverage. It seamlessly blended into my skin, leaving it feeling nourished without any oily residue. Living in a humid climate, I was delighted to find that it effectively controlled oil and lasted all day long, keeping my skin looking fresh and radiant. I was particularly thrilled that the foundation did not settle into my fine lines, and instead, it provided a smooth and natural finish that enhanced my complexion. The confidence and comfort I felt wearing this foundation are unparalleled.   Lancu00f4me Teint Idole Ultra Wear Foundation has truly transformed my makeup routine, and I cannot imagine going back to powder foundation after experiencing the remarkable results of this product. Thank you for creating such an exceptional foundation that has become an essential part of my beauty regimen."

Iu2019ve been using a lot of medium coverage, dewy skin tints lately and was a little skeptical of using a fuller coverage, matte foundation at my age. I was so pleasantly surprised! First of all, itu2019s not a flat matte. Itu2019s a pretty natural finish if you ask me, at least on my combo skin after my normal skin prep. It didnu2019t apply streaky with a brush or with a sponge and it didnu2019t settle in or accentuate my fine lines. It wore beautifully throughout the day and was still holding strong by the evening when I was ready to wash it off. It really is sweat-proof and it holds up under a mask as well. Iu2019m very impressed and will be repurchasing when I run out. Itu2019s nice to have a full coverage foundation in the rotation that looks nice on maturing skin and pairs well with my skincare.

That is definitely not the case with Teint Idole Ultra Wear. The coverage is light to medium and buildable without getting cakey. It wears beautiful and looks like a satin skin finish, which I prefer, with little to no transfer. I like to apply with a damp sponge for the most flattering effect. It did feel a little drying on the first few days I tried it, but my skin adjusted and I don't have that problem any longer (I have normal to slightly dry skin). I think the key is to get the correct shade and undertone for your skin and 220C was perfect for me."

The only complaint that I have is that it separated on my nose. I tried it with various items from just on clean skin to my usual lotions to different primers in multiple combinations of those and it would always result in separation on my nose. So, to battle that, I just stopped applying it to my nose and applied my usual sun protection and blended everything. It gave a nice natural look by doing that.

It applies well with a brush, and looks good even as the day goes on. It also doesn't have an unpleasant smell, so that's an added bonus.   Cons: It does stick to the dry parts of my face and pill with the dryness. But I would say that's to be expected of a matte foundation. I also think I probably could have gone with the pinkier undertone foundation for a better shade match.   Who I think this is best for: Neutral leaning warm skin tones, on the combo/oilier side"

But as Iu2019ve gotten older, itu2019s easier to see blemishes and dark spots and I find myself wanting a foundation again but not the thick coverage I used a couple years ago. THIS. FOUNDATION. IS. PERFECT. It feels like there is absolutely nothing on your skin, itu2019s opaque enough that it still allows your skin to maintain a natural look but itu2019s buildable if you want something a little heavier. Thereu2019s no strange smell that haunted my teenage years of heavy makeup. Itu2019s in a pump, so you can avoid as much exposure to bacteria and the air as possible. On top of that, I chose my color from a photo online and somehow it matched my skin tone perfectly. The value of this foundation is more than what they have it priced at and I canu2019t see myself using anything else while including foundation in my makeup routine."

It absorbed right away on the top layer of my skin and stayed on practically all day. It was ok with being able to layer the foundation in spots that needed it, but don't expect extremely full coverage like some other brands. In conclusion, I believe that this would be a great option for someone who doesn't want a cakey feeling face also providing even coverage when spread out."

The only time it came off a little was around my nose when I had to blow it. It also did not run into my lines & wrinkles, it stayed put even through sweating! It's definitely worth the cash it costs and performs better than any other foundation I've used to date and I've used some good brands. It also stayed on through sweating, too!"

Here's a PERSONAL review of its performance:  **Pros:**  * **Matte finish:** The foundation delivers a true matte finish that controls oil and shine throughout the day. * **Long-wearing:** It lives up to its claim of lasting for up to 24 hours. The coverage remains consistent and intact without fading or smudging. * **High coverage:** The foundation provides medium to full coverage, effectively concealing blemishes, redness, and imperfections. * **Lightweight and comfortable:** Despite its high coverage, the formula is surprisingly lightweight and comfortable to wear all day. * **Wide shade range:** Lancu00f4me offers a wide range of shades to cater to various skin tones.  **Cons:**  * **Can accentuate dry patches:** The matte finish can emphasize dry or flaky areas of the skin. Moisturizing the skin well before application is essential. * **Not suitable for all skin types:** The matte finish may not be suitable for those with very dry or sensitive skin. * **Settles into fine lines:** Over time, the foundation can settle into fine lines or wrinkles, especially for older skin. * **Limited refill options:** Repurchase can be costly compared to some other foundations that offer refill pods or accessories.  **Overall Impression:**  The Lancu00f4me Teint Idole Ultra 24H Long Wear Matte Foundation is a reliable and high-performing foundation for those seeking a matte, long-lasting finish. While it may require careful application to avoid accentuating dry patches, its exceptional coverage and durability make it a worthy investment for special occasions or everyday wear. If you have dry or sensitive skin, you may want to consider other foundation options or use a hydrating primer underneath to ensure comfort and prevent dryness."

I've worn it as a foundation is intended to be worn (full face) and on days when I didn't want to wear full makeup, I used the product for spot coverage only. I always use a foundation blender brush for application. The Teint Idole Ultra Wear Foundation truly feels tailor-made for me, offering impeccable coverage without the heavy, cakey feeling often associated with long-wear foundations.  The color is a perfect match for my skin tone. I had been skeptical about this, as well, because I always have a difficult time finding a foundation that's just right.  They often make me look either too orange or too pale. Again, not this one!  It is PERFECT. It's a match made in heaven for me.  While it may come at a slightly higher price point than what I typically budget for foundation, a little goes a long way, making it a worthwhile investment in my beauty arsenal.

I have combo (mostly oil) skin and full coverage foundation is my preference as I have acne scars and hyperpigmentation to cover up. I was previously using a competitor's long wear full coverage foundation (EL) but this foundation has quickly taken its place! This foundation is SO lightweight while being full coverage and without being cakey, which is hard to find in a full coverage foundation. This has lasted 10+ hours on my skin with minimal touchup throughout the day. It does not settle in to fine lines or break apart, which most foundations on me do. The shade range is excellent and I was very easily able to find my shade (love the olive undertone representation!!). If you're looking for a foundation to cover everything and that will last you from day to night, this is the one!!"

This foundation has quickly become my go-to for achieving a flawless complexion.   Firstly, the coverage is incredible. With just a small amount, it effortlessly camouflages any blemishes, redness, or discoloration on my skin. It provides a medium to full coverage that is buildable, allowing me to customize the level of coverage I desire.   What I love most about this foundation is its lightweight formula. It feels like a second skin and doesn't weigh down my face at all. It blends seamlessly and evenly, giving me a natural-looking finish that doesn't look heavy or cakey.   Another standout feature is its long-lasting power. The Lancu00f4me Teint Idole Foundation stays put all day, even in hot and humid weather. I never have to worry about it melting off or fading throughout the day. It keeps my skin looking fresh and matte, without the need for constant touch-ups.  Overall, I highly recommend the Lancu00f4me Teint Idole Foundation to anyone who wants a high-quality foundation that provides excellent coverage, a natural finish, and long-lasting wear. It's a true game-changer in the world of foundations, and I can't imagine my makeup routine without it!"

It matched beautifully and was easy to apply with a beauty blender. It took just a few minutes. I contoured, bronzed and blushed. Using this everyday with different primers and products and it stood through the changes. My skin looked filtered and smooth. I was thrilled with the results and the wear time as it lasted all day to my surprise. It doesn't feel heavy on the skin, honestly it does not feel like you're wearing anything. It blends great and works with any product I have added whether underpainting or layering on top. I love the glass bottle and the push top dispenser as it makes a clean and easy application. I would definitely purchase this again in the future. I am eager to pair it with the Lancome concealer. Truly a beautiful finish of matte, where it is not drying, it does not look dry and is exactly what I have been looking for in a foundation. I have mature skin, well starting to have mature skin in my 30s and have been pleasantly surprised with this."

For starters it is VERY yellow, more yellow than you expect and it was for me even though I am very pale with warm tones. So definitely shade match! Secondly I struggled to layer it over moisturiser and/or SPF without the foundation pilling which is super unfortunate as I view moisturiser and SPF as a must under makeup. With that being said I would probably use this for nightouts or mix it with some moisturiser to help with the pilling.  The good thing about this foundation is that without the pilling it goes on very nicely and blends with my other products so well (liquid blush, highlighter, cream contour stick) for a really put together and dewy makeup look. It's also decently long lasting and I feel like this is good for 8 hours of wear before it starts to break down.  I want to emphasize again that it does leave the skin looking nice when applied correctly.  I'd give this a 4/5 as it is very dependent on the application. If you are interested in the foundation I can't stress enough how important it is to go for a shade match and also test the product as apparently the formula changed a year ago!  I received this product for free in exchange for writing a review, just as a full disclosure! :)"

            "review_text": "I LOVE the formulation of Lancu00f4meu2019s Teint Idole Ultra 24H Long Wear Matte Foundation, and 245C is an exact match. The product is liquid with medium, buildable coverage and so light and breathable, the texture is skin-like. I use a smaller, but very dense, fiber foundation brush and the application is phenomenal. My skin isnu2019t oily or dry most days, though once in a while, it falls under combination. On those days, I typically have to be careful with matte foundations. Not with Lancu00f4me Teint Idole foundation. My skin is  perfectly even; no patchiness or fading. Powder and cream products donu2019t affect the flawless foundation coverage, though seem to benefit from Teint Idoleu2019s 24 hour wear. I have worn the foundation with and without primer and the difference is minimal. Some days, I donu2019t need concealer, which is incredible since I have very dark circles under my eyes.   I compared the Lancu00f4me Teint Idole foundation to my Chanel Les Beiges, and I was a little surprised to find the Lancu00f4me is superior. The Chanel is a little dusty and amplified pores that arenu2019t otherwise noticeable. My single, minor dislike is the foundation contains SPF, which is due to my personal preference and does not, objectively, change the efficacy at all.  Although I was gifted the Lancu00f4me Teint Idole from BzzAgent, I give fair reviews, as you can see in my history. I truly test the product under different conditions for nearly a month, even though Iu2019m aware it means I wonu2019t have the opportunity to test additional beauty products during that period.   *Please note I had just recovered from COVID when I took this photo a few days ago."

It wore really well throughout the day however did break a little on my chin after 6 hours which is usually my problem area.

I have found that it does dry pretty fast, and it does cling to dry patches (I have combination skin - oily in T-zone, dry on cheeks).  I do have to moisturize my skin VERY well to prevent that from happening.  I tried applying it several ways - finger, wet blending sponge, brush.  I think the most successful was the sponge.  The finish is very nice - it says matte, and it is for the most part.  I do get a little shine in my T-zone, but it does control oil better than most foundations. I think the nicest things about this foundation are that it feels lightweight and has the SPF in it.  - Thank you to BzzAgent for allowing me to try this foundation for free!"

One of the standout features of this foundation is its impressive staying power. True to its name, Teint Idole Ultra stays put for a full 24 hours without fading, creasing, or transferring. Whether you're facing a long day at the office or dancing the night away, this foundation remains intact, ensuring your makeup looks fresh from morning until night.  That being said, there are a couple of drawbacks to consider. While the foundation does an excellent job of controlling oil and shine, it may not be the best option for those with extremely dry skin, as it can accentuate dry patches. Additionally, the price point may be a bit high for some, but considering the quality and performance of the product, it's well worth the investment.  In conclusion, Lancu00f4me's Teint Idole Ultra 24H Long Wear Foundation is a standout product that lives up to its promises. With its long-lasting formula, comfortable wear, and extensive shade range."

Next use I made sure I applied my moisturizer's (20 mins prior) then dabbled product on my face using a foundation brush. Once the foundation had time to set my face looked flawless. From the first time I applied to the second time around the foundation's results were night and day! I have a new go to item. It's very light weight and buildable. SPF is a super plus! I am mid 40's with combination skin.  I would recommend this to anyone that is looking to try a new higher end foundation, I was pleasantly surprised with the outcome. Even with a matte finish you can add a finishing spray that will give dewy results and will have no impact to the staying power. Please note I received this foundation complimentary from BuzzAgent in exchange for my honest review.  #Buzzagent #Lancome"

I tried this foundation with no primer, illuminating primer and mattifying primer and got the best results with mattifying primer + mattifying setting spray but still needed to power and blot within 4 hours of wear. Besides that the foundation feels very comfortable on the skin and is a true buildable formula. This does have SPF so if you are sensitive keep this away from your eyes or it may cause mild irritation.  Overall I do really like this foundation and would recommend to people looking for a soft matte with buildable coverage. Please note I received this product for free to try and review."

I wiped my face, my nose was running, I for sure thought my makeup looked atrocious but to my surprise it looked just as nice as it did when I applied. Even though it's a matte formula it feels so silky smooth on my skin, it doesn't emphasize texture, and covers up discoloration quite well. I did feel like I had to apply several pumps at times to get the coverage I desired, however I tried a few different brushes and found to enjoy a large almost medium density brush to achieve even flawless coverage. Overall I'm blown away at the quality of this foundation it's a 10 out of ten even though the bottle appears small it's a sturdy glass bottle, the details are an extra bonus you can just tell its luxurious. I received the shade 135N slightly darker than I anticipated but that's ok for summer."

The foundation does last a long time, I wore it for the day and it didn't irritate my skin. I have dry combo skin and it didn't feel bad at all with good prep of my skin with the primer and products. Make sure you go in store for proper matching and even if you don't wear a setting spray this wont move. It didn't budge when I forgot to put on setting spray. My first time trying and I am impressed."

As far as the sunscreen, I didn't notice anything that would indicate it as far as scent or the texture.

I felt like I had a blur filter on with the right touch of glow.   Shockingly decent coverage with one pass of the brush despite the thinner texture of the foundation. Went on light but stayed PUT. And I emphasize stayed put because I proceeded to go to a pretty high energy concert later in the day, sang and danced my heart out and when I got home my face still looked great. Not just the foundation but it also kept my blush fresh and that always seems to fade. 10/10 recommend and will be buying this regularly from now on."

On days where I wanted to spend more time on my makeup it also applied great with my brush.   Longevity: On a usual office day it was still looking good & matte upon completion. I also wore this to an outdoor event and despite breaking a sweat with hot temps my face stayed matte. +1 because I naturally have very oily skin.   Coverage: The coverage is buildable and I was able to skip concealing dark spots and foundation while applying with both my fingers and a brush. Itu2019s also not at all splotchy and I found that the color didnu2019t change upon oxidizing.  Overall Iu2019m really impressed with this foundation!

It goes on super smoothly and evenly, without any clumping or looking too thick on my face. Plus, it lasts all day and provides good everyday wear coverage, but you can still see actual skin, so it doesnt feel like paint. It is not opaque. It is quite transparent tbh. The scent Is neutral, which is a big deal for me because I have super sensitive skin. I've never had any issues with irritation when using this foundation. Overall, Lancome's Teint Idole Ultra Wear Foundation is definitely a winner for me. It's lightweight feel, long-lasting coverage, and skin-friendly formula make it a staple in my makeup bag."

The texture of the foundation is really nice on the back of my hand, doesnu2019t feel heavy or anything, and it doesnu2019t have that sunscreen smell. Goes on very smoothly on my face. I used half a pump, and I do believe it is buildable. It says itu2019s a natural matte finish and I have to agree with that. I do have acne and texture on my skin and it emphasizes my texture. The foundation covers most of my dark spots and scars but some still peak out. It also says itu2019s transfer resistant, if you dab at your face with tissue a little will come off but not a lot, however if you swipe, more will come off obviously. The packaging is stunning, and feels very luxe. Overall a really nice foundation with sunscreen, and I need to get it in my actual foundation shade now!"

I did enjoy the way my skin was not completely matte and flat looking I still had a glow showing underneath from my skin prep. I wouldnu2019t recommend this for people with very dry skin (I would use their glow version of this) as up close I noticed it was clinging to a few dry patches in my skin which I did expect as it is advertised as a matte foundation. To be completely fair it was a lot closer in the mirror than anyone typically would be looking in person but regardless it still was clinging to my dry patches. From a little further back in the mirror it looked beautiful like my skin but better. I first tried to blend this product with my fingers as I felt it would be the most difficult and give me a chance to really feel this product and it worked so unexpectedly well. I really did enjoy this foundation and would recommend for those with normal to oily skin looking for a matte foundation with medium coverage.

Wears well throughout the day with only one initial powder application. However, the oxidation on this foundation is next level. I have light skin with neutral-ish undertones, and within 2 minutes the foundation takes me to medium skin tone with warm undertones. I usually do a light layer of foundation and then fix it with a bit of concealer. This would be better fitted to my summer shade, so make sure to test in store or get 2-3 shades lighter than you normally would."

The matte finish holds up remarkably well throughout the day, absorbing excess oil without the need for touch-ups.  Overall, the Lancu00f4me Teint Idole Ultra 24H Long Wear Foundation excels in longevity, coverage, matte finish, and especially in skin protection thanks to its SPF formulation.

This foundation has been considered a holy grail for oily/combo skin so I tried it out. First off this foundation applies beautifully, but you must wear a primer or use a setting powder with it or else you're going to be an oily mess. Upon first application, I did it without primer and a setting powder, because this is 50 dollar foundation and I didn't expect to use setting powder. The primer I skipped out on because I can't find it. So this did not last me very long before I started getting extremely oily. The foundation still held up pretty well once I blotted, in fact it looked like new after doing so. The next day, I decided to apply the foundation and then use a setting powder on top, and this it worked pretty well. My makeup held up for a long time and I only needed to blot one time. I do believe that if I get a new primer that will control my oil, this foundation will look flawless even longer."

Lancu00f4me is a premium beauty brand and itu2019s no surprise that the TIU foundation feels rich on the skin!   The Lancu00f4me TIU has a very luxurious look and feel when applied. It has a medium yet lightweight coverage giving off a luminous and smooth look to the skin. It applies smoothly and leaves the skin looking fresh, flawless and radiant. What I loved the most was that unlike most of the foundation it doesnu2019t feel heavy on my skin and leaves no appearance of fine lines and creases. It is buildable and has the added advantage of broad spectrum SPF 25 so I can wear the foundation and skip the sunscreen.   The bottle is sleek, premium and comes with a pump dispenser so itu2019s easy to use the amount of foundation needed with precision. The 325 C perfectly matched my skin tone and gave it full flawless coverage. My acne marks and uneven skin tone was covered flawlessly and yet my skin felt breathable. I just applied some blush and my face looked radiant!   I am really happy with the results and the Lancu00f4me TIU foundation will now be an essential to go in my beauty regime.   I highly recommend the Lancu00f4me Teint Idole Ultra Wear foundation. Pamper yourself!"

I applied using a moist blender sponge and a few pumps on the back of my hand to warm the product before applying. My skin felt pretty good inside and out after applying as opposed to sticky and suffocating like some foundations Iu2019ve tried. The coverage was medium and just right IMO and the finish was a youthful matte with some natural glow breaking through, which I love. My skin tends to look oily after applying other foundations which requires a powder to mattify (Iu2019m trying really hard to avoid all powders at the moment to increase the look of youthfulness), so this finish is what Iu2019ve been trying to achieve! The color I chose 220C may have been a little lighter than I would have chosen in person, but nothing my bronzers couldnu2019t handle. I applied this foundation in the afternoon, and after about 5 hours I noticed some minimal shine in the t-zone and chin area. Nothing crazy.  When removing at bedtime, I noticed my cleanser didnu2019t take as much off as I expected, so I used micellar water, rewashed, and then my regular toner. Probably an indication of how long lasting it will be.  Will definitely require a makeup remover.  Overall, would I buy this product? The price is a little out of my range, personally, but definitely worth every penny and highly recommended!"

This foundation being a 24 hour matte foundation doesnu2019t feel like other matte foundations. This feels moisturizing and looku2019s luminous.  I have an olive skin tone so getting 400w was a perfect choice considering itu2019s for medium-deep olive skin with warm/ golden undertones.  From my experience with this foundation my skin looks so natural and doesnu2019t feel or look cakey like other foundations.  It covers any flaws and, and stays in all day long. You wonu2019t  have to worry about reapplying. You donu2019t need to use a lot on your face because, a little goes a long way.  I definitely would buy and recommend to family and friends."

It stays put all day, keeping my complexion fresh and matte without feeling heavy or cakey. As I age, I'm in my early 40s, it's getting more difficult to find a foundation that does not settle in my fine lines, even when using primer. I couldn't even see my fine lines with this foundation! I didn't have to reapply my powder even once all day, and I wear glasses. The coverage is buildable, but not necessary .  I tried both cream and powder blush on top of this foundation and was impressed by the staying power of the coverage and the ability to blend in the color.

The lightweight feel of this foundation on my skin was incredible; it felt like a second skin. As someone with combination skin, I appreciated how it kept my drier areas hydrated without adding extra shine to my oily T-zone.  One thing I loved was its buildable coverage, allowing me to customize the finish. And can we talk about the packaging? It's downright luxurious, exactly what you'd expect from a high-end foundation.  But, alas, there's a hiccup. Despite carefully selecting shade 415w based on online visuals, the color was way offu2014too dark and too orange for my skin tone. Let's just say I resembled an unintentional Oompa Loompa.  For that reason alone, I had to dock a star. And as much as I adored the foundation, the steep price tag of $57 is a tough sell for me."

Also iu2019d say that 110C new pulls more yellow than the old version which is also frustrating, making it look pretty orange on me. Swatches in natural light for comparison in photo. Estee lauder 1C0 Shell is an excellent match for me, so i guess im giving up on lancome"

As a makeup enthusiast, I've had the pleasure of using this foundation over an extended period, and it has truly become a favorite in my collection. The medium coverage is buildable, allowing for a customized application that caters to different occasions. What sets this foundation apart is the radiant and natural finish it imparts. The healthy-looking glow it provides is unparalleled, giving my skin a luminosity that lasts throughout the day. The inclusion of hyaluronic acid and mandelic acid in the formula is a game-changer. Hyaluronic acid ensures my skin stays hydrated and visibly plumped, while mandelic acid contributes to smoothing and refining the skin texture. It's rare to find a foundation that not only offers beautiful coverage but also incorporates skincare elements that genuinely benefit the skin."

Not only can I not find an exact color match to my skin, but the new formula is hard to blend, leaving it somewhat streaky and the consistency is thinner with somewhat worse coverage.  Additionally, it is not long lasting and even with minor sweating melts right off my face, even going in my eyes and causing burning, especially in the summer.  So sad to see this one go!  In the meantime, I'm buying up all the old formula wherever I can find it and hopefully that will give me enough time to transition to a different brand that is better than the new Lancome formula.  I would like to have faith that they might bring back the old formula, but the company has probably already spent lots of money and resources in developing the new and improved formula so I doubt they would go back to the old one.  I'm sure they were trying to produce this new formula for someone, but it's just not for me, and based on the reviews I have seen about the new formula, many life-long users will stop using this product too.  I guess all good things must come to an end."

It would fix sleepless nights, dry skin, discoloration, you name it. It looked elegant and rich. This new formula is a disaster. First, the new colors donu2019t match the old ones and l they all look yellowish. Second, it dries my skin regardless what I use as a primer and how many layers of moisturizer I add. Thirds, it breaks down and looks patch no matter how I apply it, beauty blender, brush, fingers. Yes, it absolutely looks like I have foundation on and this is the first time I am using such products. Takes you back to high school in 2000."

Long lasting: NO. In fact it smudges off very easily. It cakes after 3-4 hrs. It's semi matte. I have oily skin and this in no way, shape or form compares to the OLD FORMULA, which didn't budge and contained 15spf sunscreen. This one says titanium dioxide as last ingredient, so you don't know how much supposed spf it has (could be a little as .001%) They might as well call this by another name because it's NOT THE SAME. Will go back to fenty pro filtr' when I finish this $77.00 mistake that I bought 6wks ago. There are better MATTE, OIL FREE, NON TRANSFERABLE bases out there like fenty. I also use a oil absorbing primer underneath and it still turns out a hot mess. u26a0ufe0f"

The new formula is really bad,it breaks me out, settles into fine lines and pores, looks cakey, not natural, runny, and breaks apart. So sad they changed the formula, it was perfect before. could have sparked new interest, kept the old formula and the new formula to see which sold better - almost like a game - let your customers decide. or keep both formulas out why not? So here I am, looking for my new go-to holy grail and no longer a lancome tent idol girl."

My quest led me to Lancu00f4me Teint Idole Ultra 24H Long Wear Matte Foundation, and I can confidently say that I've found my new go-to foundation.  First and foremost, the lasting power of this foundation is truly remarkable. I've worn it for full days, from early morning meetings to late-night dinners, and it stayed in place flawlessly. The 24H claim might sound ambitious, but this foundation truly lives up to it. No more touch-ups throughout the day; it's like a second skin that doesn't budge.  The matte finish is another standout feature. It provides a velvety, airbrushed look without making my skin feel dry or tight. I have combination skin with an oily T-zone, and this foundation helps control shine all day long without over-drying the rest of my face.  One of my favorite things about this foundation is the broad shade range Lancu00f4me offers. Finding the perfect shade was a breeze, and the color match was spot-on. It blends seamlessly into my skin, providing a natural look that doesn't scream I'm wearing foundation.  The coverage is buildable, which is a huge plus for me. Whether I want a sheer, everyday look or full coverage for a special occasion, this foundation can do it all. It effortlessly covers imperfections, redness, and uneven skin tone, leaving me with a flawless complexion.  What truly sets Lancu00f4me Teint Idole Ultra 24H Foundation apart is its lightweight feel. It doesn't feel like you're wearing a mask, even with full coverage. It's comfortable, breathable, and doesn't clog pores or cause breakouts u2013 a must for those with sensitive or acne-prone skin.  The packaging is elegant and practical, with a pump that dispenses just the right amount of product. A little goes a long way, so"

It is also drying and caused a few breakouts.  Might be due to the addition of titanium dioxide to up the SPF in the new formula.  Over all it is not a bad option for light to medium coverage normal skin people that donu2019t need it to stay on all day.   Iu2019m going to EL Double wear unfortunately as that is now better than this new formula.  Iu2019m very disappointed that my HG foundation of many years is no longer the same."

Coverage was full and was fine from a distance, but it did not look good closer up at a conversational distance. If you have oily skin though, this foundation may work well for you.

Ive always been a huge fan of Lancome and they reformulated this foundation to be more lightweight on the skin, and they definitely delievered!

PROS: Lightweight feel, great medium to full coverage, blends effortlessly and does not dry too quickly, variety of shades to find the perfect match, i love that its a matte finish combined with powder no shine!, smell is pleasant for me theres only TWO con and its that the foundation oxides tremendously. First application to after its dried its like 3-4 shades of a difference which is kind of intense so its best ti get matched to this foundation in person rather than online in my professional opinion. The other con is it does have the toxic chemical sunscreen in it among a few other undesirable ingredients. I definitely do recommend this foundation for a full coverage look without the heaviness on the skin! This foundation lasted about 10 hours for me! I recommend finishing with a powder than setting spray! This foundation could be drying to some people with dry skin     I recevied this product complimentary from Influenster for my honest review :)"

I have to stress that if you have fine lines or wrinkles, you must prep your skin with a moisturizer or primer as it can cause them to show more due to the matte formula. I like to use a sunblock that isn't oily. As long as I prep, my skin looks phenomenal when I wear this.

I personally thought it provided enough coverage to look natural. I like the long wear formula -it lasted me a good 8 hours and still looked freshly applied. I have combination skin - more so oily and I didnt feel the need to touch up while wearing it.

It also has a wide range of shades to suit every skin tone and undertone. It is oil-free and non-comedogenic, so it doesnu2019t clog my pores or cause breakouts. It is also fragrance-free and suitable for sensitive skin. I only wish I had the correct shade"
