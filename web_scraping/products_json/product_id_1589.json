I got this one in the latest lip kit from Sephora and I was really excited to try out the shimmer glass shade and the Rosy Mauve looked like it would apply as a darker color. It doesnu2019t.  At all. The color barely shows up when applied but you do get the shimmer. Paired with a brown or darker shaded lip liner, if you fill in your lips (or just use a lip stick), it works well as a topper to provide that shimmer. I also could not tell that this was plumping AT ALL. It does have a really weird mint taste if it gets in your mouth (inevitable if you eat or drink anything) but definitely would not call this plumping. This one doesnu2019t melt nearly as much as the first shade I tried. The Nyx Slick Click pens are so much better imo. The shade No Filter Needed from Nyx is comparable to this one and probably shows up a lot better. I have the Nyx pen in shade In a Mood which looks similar from the photos to the Tarte shade Currant and for $9 Iu2019m picking Nyx. The application and product are so much better than Tarte on every level. Unless you want the name associated with this, save your money."

I want to preface this by saying I donu2019t like plumping products due to their stingy nature (having my lips feel burnt and swollen is not ideal imo), and lip glosses or even balms just to me seem so pointless, and I never like the texture. So why do I like this?? First of all, this does not sting. It has a really RESFRESHING cooling sensation. With that said, I notice little to no plumping. Maybe my lips look a tad fuller? But they definitely donu2019t look stung by a bee. That doesnu2019t bother me. The cooling sensation actually lasts awhile too, and again, I find it resfreshing and Iu2019m hypersensitive. This glides on really nicely, it isnu2019t u2018slipperyu2019 to where it is simply going to slide off, and it absolutely is not tacky. And to my absolute surprise, it lasts deeeecently well. I was trying to convince myself to like a lip oil, and that lasts all of 10 minutes and I just donu2019t see the hype. Anyways, I bought the full size tarte plump in u2018tulipu2019 and it is super pigmented! It does NOT slide into my fine lines or smear. It will wear off, but it fades gradually and doesnu2019t cling to any weird dry spots either. If you want to put something on your lips without the full commitment of a lipstick, but canu2019t jump on the lip oil/lipgloss bandwagon, I totally would say to give this a try!"

If you pair it with a lip liner, you can add a bit of definition too. I definitely want to pick up and test a couple more shades because this is the most gorgeous sparkly lip I have ever had.

Finally, in terms of results, I would say this is a good moisturizing lip product. It does have a cooling, minty sensation which some people like and others don't, so a big heads up there.

I was a die-hard original formula Glossier  DotBalm fan for about 8 years, and then they changed the formula and it no longer worked for me.  I have since tried:  PawPaw, LanoLips, Summer Fridays, Tarte, Glossier Shiny Lip Gloss, Burt's Bees, Goop, Merit, and Juicy Colour Pop all in an attempt to find a cruelty-free lip gloss that nourishes my lips, stays on, and just adds a lit of gloss.  I'm going for that classy touch of make-up that makes people ask you what you are wearing. I got that a lot with an old school version of Bobbi Brown pale pink gloss (not cruelty free) and Glossier.  Comparing all the substitutes, this is what I have to say about this particular product:  PROS: - goes on nicely - nourishes your lips - stays on for a reasonable amount of time - looks nice on - I think it gives average sized lips a little luster without being over the top   CONS: - price by far is the biggest con - applicator is a huge con.  You lose a significant amount of expensive product by the time you get to the bottom. Buy yourself a Spaddy Daddy to scoop up the expensive leftovers. - It doesn't last as long as on your lips or in the tube as the original formula Glossier DotBalm. I found myself both applying more frequently (though not as frequently as Summer Fridays, for example) AND running out of the product within 1 month, while using other products at the same time.  That's a quick turn around for $25. - applicator seems to use a lot of plastic - it's a chunky device that seems largely unnecessary for a soft lip product.   In closing - I'd recommend this product IF it were on sale.  They need to change the applicator so you can get the product at the end, or reduce the price so you don't feel like you're wasting so much."

            "review_text": "This is a beautiful, high quality formula but I'm surprised it has such a strong COCONUT scent, since people seem to either love or hate coconut. I've read so many reviews that I want to give a detailed review here, that I wish I had read begore buying.   PLUMPING: I don't taste menthol or feel tingling, but there is an obvious COOLING sensation. So it's kind of like a gentle menthol feeling but not too distracting and no minty vibe. I don't notice my lips plumping but because it's thick and fills in lines, I think visually it gives a fuller look. For people who like plumpers Tarte nailed a non-irritating, comfy sensation.   TEXTURE: just like my image text says, this feels like a cross between a gloss, balm, creamy lipstick, plumper and a lip oil. I'd say it's a dream, comfy formula if you like high shine. Some chapstick junkies might love this as a thin, nourishing swipe.  MOISTURIZING: Yup! feels like I could wear this in sub-zero temperatures and know that my lips are protected.   TASTE: I wish more reviewers and Youtubers would discuss TASTE. This one does not have a strong taste. When layered thick it might have the tiniest bit of a clean ingredients taste with slight taste of the coconut, but so minimal.   SCENT: very strong coconut scent. I'm shocked they went with a coconut scent since many people I know hate coconut. With a thin layer I don't mind it (i love coconut) but it's not ideal to smell this while I'm drinking or eating. With a thick layer the scent is so overpowering that I'm considering returning this. I get migraines from harsh scents like this.   COLOUR: This might as well be clear. Maybe the baby pink colour shows up over a lip stain or filled-in liner. Or maybe on a darker skin tone. It kind of lightened my naturally berry-coloured lips to be more pink, but only with an uncomfortably thick layer.   VALUE: If you don't mind the scent and lack of pigment in lighter tones, this is an amazing product. It's not messy if you keep it low in the tube"

After 1 month and 1/2 of using it, no more product wanted to come out and I had to really scrub some of it out, since the u201cclickingu201d thing did no longer push the product out. Overall, if you are ready to spend 30$ for a hydrating and pigmented lipstick only to use it for 1 and 1/2, then I recommend it. Other than that, donu2019t buy it."

Best of all is this colour--it's just beautiful, a great dupe for Clinique Black Honey, though I like it even better, and the formula is 100x better than the Almost Lipstick.  Honeysuckle is a good reddish-brown, not too mauve, which doesn't work as well with my light-medium skin with warm undertones.  I just wish Sephora Canada stocked the matching Honeysuckle Maracuja juicy lip liner shade --it seems to be available on the USA Tarte website, but nowhere else.  Please bring it in ASAP!"

However, and the reason for a star knocked off, I hate applying it, itu2019s almost too creamy/emollient, and if I try to just swipe on the lips like shown in all the vids, SO much product gets on that I would need to go back in with a lip brush to spread out the product evenly or dab my lips with some paper towel to remove some of the product,not sure if it is just mine, but Iu2019ve learned best way to apply is def just tapping on your lips and rub in or apply with a lip brush if needing a bit more precision.

I wouldn't say it really plumps my lips much, but I still love the way it feels. i got White Peach and the color is pretty nude but is great as an every day subtle color. All of that being said, mine stopped clicking up after about 5 uses. I'm super annoyed since there is still a ton of product in the tube and I don't have an easy way of using it now. If you're looking for something similar that doesn't break as easily, I recommend SEPHORA COLLECTION Melting Lip Clicks Lip Balm. I have 3 different colors of these and love them. None have stopped clicking up on me. The product doesn't have the same plumping/cooling affect but I'd still probably prefer them to the Tarte one's since they are way cheaper & haven't broken."

In fact, I actually prefer this shade wayyyy more! The pigment is definitely light-medium, but still gives some good color to the lips. Since itu2019s a deeper shade, I find it looks best actually patted on rather than swiping it. It has a really nice shine and stays looking pretty when it sinks into the lips after an hour or two. The u201cstingingu201d is not bad at all and is similar to that of the Buxom lip glosses, and goes away after about 20-30 minutes. I find the feeling really satisfying honestly!! The plumping effect isnu2019t really plumping, but OMG it did fill in my natural lip lines to make them sooo smooth. Hope this helps and I wouldnu2019t hesitate on this lip product!! Loving it and definitely getting more shades."

The product glides on smoothly over lips and the color is buildable. It leaves a fresh, minty feeling on the lips which I love, but others may find it irritating. Other reviews mentioned there was a smell but I do not notice any smell whatsoever. I'm not sure that this product gives me any majorly noticeable plump, but my lips do feel slightly plump and I think the shine of the formula also gives the illusion of plumper lips. Either way I love this product so much and highly recommend. I got the shade poppy which is a beautiful pink perfect for spring and summer. I can't wait to buy more shades!!"

Honeysuckle is really pretty, but I wasn't a fan of Tulip which was not as much a sheer colour as Honeysuckle.   On the lips, the Maracuja lip plump feels similar to the Makeup by Mario plumping lip serum, but they really don't smell as nice and the MBM also have a bit of shimmer, where these don't. To me, this product smells slightly like coconut, and a lot like sunscreen and suntanning products... I know, weird!  Once you apply on the lips, if feels minty/cooling/plumping, (similar to the Makeup by Mario plumping lip serum) but unlike the MBM which smell minty, the coconut/suntanning/sunscreen smell/taste never goes away.  For that reason, I find this product to be disappointing  and a fail for me.  I was really looking forward to another minty lip product from tarte. I will definitely stick to the Sea Quench balms. I would recommend going in the store to smell them before buying them, I admit I have an extra sensitive nose and I'm very particular with how products smell, so you may not be as bothered by it as I am! On the positive side, they do feel plumping and hydrating!"
