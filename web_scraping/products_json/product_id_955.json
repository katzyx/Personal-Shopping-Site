            "review_text": "I purchased this as something to have when I want my makeup to stay put and I want my complexion blurred out more. I have dry fair skin and this shade is really nice for me and blends in + brightens seamlessly, I find loose powders annoying and messy but no pressed powder seemed to outshine this one. For dry skin, it does not feel bad, but it does feel different since I am not use to powders on my face. When I apply it of course that 'just-moisturized' bouncy feeling goes away for me and it takes away a lot of that 'shine' that a dry skinned person might love (such as myself) but an oily skinned person probably does not. I am not one to have sensitive skin to many products and I wouldn't say I am allergic to this as I had no reaction that would be typical of allergies but my skin did have a ~weird~ feeling after immediately applying it - maybe thats normal idk lol? Ultimately I am conflicted with keeping or returning this - on one hand it does everything right that I originally wanted it to do, but I just personally don't seem to love powder on my face so it seems like a steep price to pay for something I will likely not reach for everyday and savour for nights out and events which are few and far between. I have nothing to compare this to and I don't want to be one of those reviewers that say 'don't try this' just because of my preferences, however I would say if you like powders and are looking for something to smooth out your skin and not look cakey, this is worth a try. If you're dry like me and want to try a powder, I think this is a good option for you and there is a strong chance you will love it. I can't speak for other skin types but I think its a solid product if you can get past the price."

The one negative thing I would say, is I wish it came with the special puff to apply it. When I went to the store, they were out so I got something else. It made applying a little awkward.

I have dry skin as I live in a desert climate, so I use a moisturizing routine and prefer a Dewey look. This power takes away the look I'm going for, so I probably won't use it.

The main thing I notice that I'm not really liking is that this powder has sparkle too it, not glitter but it almost has like an eye shadow sparkle to it, I'm guessing from the silica. I would definitely be aware of that before purchasing and I would highly recommend asking for a sample to try before pulling the trigger because you may not enjoy sparkle under your eyes. due to the sparkle I use this on other points of my face which is a little disappointing because I love pink powder under my eyes."

The lightweight, finely milled texture feels amazing and blurs imperfections beautifully.  The only small downside is that it can sometimes be a bit drying for very dry areas, and it doesn't come with a pouf, but overall, the flawless finish is worth it. Highly recommend for a fresh, radiant look!"

I need it to set my concealer without looking cakey (I do not bake) or settling into lines, without clinging to dry patches. It's a tall order but this Laura Mercier powder fills it. It's super finely milled; so fine it feels like absolute silk - I don't even know how they do that. It does not clump up on the skin. It is the perfect peach/pink shade, so it would work for many skin tones whether warm or cool. It's humid summer and right now, all I use is this and the Laura Mercier concealer underneath. You can see from the before/after photo that it really does blur pores but doesn't make skin look too dry or baked. It's wonderful!"

My expectations were already high because I have purchased the translucent shade of this powder many times and it is phenomenal. The rose shade, somehow, is even better. It gives my complexion such a healthy and smooth appearance while still mattifying my oily patches. This powder actually blurs my (humongous) pores and sets my makeup beautifully to avoid creasing in my fine lines. Check out the before and after comparison photo I posted! This formula partners well with every combination of foundation, skin tint or setting spray that Iu2019ve used along with it. The rose shade is subtle but so flattering, just making my skin look healthier and more youthful. I believe it would enhance a wide variety of skin types and complexions, so I would definitely recommend it to everyone."

The product definitely smooths out my pores and gives a flawless finish initially.  I have been getting several hours of wear from the powder, but nowhere near the 16 hours promised.  My skin is fairly oily, and I think this product may be better-suited for dry or normal skin, since it is talc-free and includes hyaluronic acid for hydration.  The peachy pink tint is barely discernible, but it definitely gives fairer skin a pickup glow.  The product recommends applying with a powder puff, but no powder puff is included.  At this price point, this was surprising.  Overall, a good product with a light finish, but it does not keep oily skin shine-free for long."

However, there is a slight white cast in flash photos. While itu2019s on the pricier side, the quality makes it worth it. Overall, itu2019s a fantastic setting powder for a flawless, long-lasting finish."

I prefer using this to brighten up my under eyes due to the peachy pink tones, but it also works great as an all over face powder to set your foundation. It doesnu2019t make my face appear chalky or pink either. Iu2019ve noticed that my foundation looks instantly matte and my pores are blurred. I was amazed that my foundation was still intact at the end of the day, so it does last through the heat and humidity. I highly recommend this powder for my oily gals who want to brighten up their complexion."

I love the slightly peachy pink color because it blends well with my skin tone. I stream online as an esports coach so it's very important to me how my skin looks on camera as well as in real life. This powder works without creating weird reflections. The powder is so soft so you can tell how good of quality it is. The only con I can come up with is if I want to take the product with me, the powder gets a lot in the top of the container & I have to shake it upright to get less mess, but it really isn't an issue!

Second time I did a light dusting all over to set everything but nothing particularly heavy under the eye. Again, so many compliments on how bright my skin looked! Aside from that, every time I use the product, my makeup STAYS! Not stays like its there so I look smooth but maybe oily - like exactly the same by the end of the night!

Not sure if it's because I already have a fair/light complexion but it doesn't do any brightening as it claims. However, I do love this powder, it seems just as good as the original formula and I do use it all over my skin and do not notice any white cast (or in this case, pink cast). I was hoping this will do some wonders for my undereyes but it doesn't. It's a little drying on the undereye area (I have combo skin but dry undereyes) so I avoid using it there. Overall, if you have the OG, you can skip this but it is a very good setting powder to try if you don't have it."

The powder is very finely milled and it goes on smooth - it doesn't look cakey, it doesn't crease or crack.. it looks good. The rose tint is nice and brightening. I have a light-medium/medium complexion with slightly golden undertones and other rose tinted powders I've tried haven't done much for me, but this one has a great balance of hues that actually do appear brightening on my skin.  The only con for me is that the oils in my face still seeped through a couple hrs after wearing.. however, this is a setting powder so it's not its job to keep me shine free... the price is a bit steep but this product will last you a looooong time, so it ends up being a good value."

Applying it is a breeze u2013 it blends effortlessly and never looks cakey. I love how it blurs my pores and imperfections, leaving my skin looking smooth and flawless. Plus, it keeps my makeup in place all day, which is a game-changer for my oily T-zone.  The packaging is elegant and practical, with a sifter that helps control the amount of product you use. While itu2019s a bit pricey, the container lasts a long time because you donu2019t need much to achieve great results.  Overall, this powder has exceeded my expectations.

My purpose of using a setting powder is to bring down shine from my very moisturizing morning skincare routine, Iu2019m 99% skincare 1% makeup. After serum, moisturizer, and spf Iu2019m left looking a bit more slick than dewy so Iu2019ve always done a quick dusting of the Translucent Laura Mercier setting powder. It worked fine but I felt like it sat on top of my skin all day and sucked some of the moisture back out leaving me a little chalky. This powder sinks in and doesn't budge. It also provides a nice blur effect in the spots I have some bigger pores. I wouldnu2019t say it brightens as much as other products Iu2019ve used but it also doesnu2019t dull my skin down. Itu2019s a very nice upgrade from the traditional loose powder. Iu2019ll definitely be purchasing this one from now on."

I'll start off with the positive. It helps with shine if you have oily skin. I used this over sunscreen and helped give me a matte finish without making me look like a ghost. I even used another layer of sunscreen later in the day over this product and was not left cakey which I was worried about. The rose tint makes it blend well with my skin so I don't look pale. Overall very impressed with the formulation, specifically how it absorbs excess oil without drying me out or making me look cakey. What I don't like about it is how much it stings. This has vitamin c which I am sensitive to and I definitely had a reaction. Nothing terrible, but certainly uncomfortable. The other issue is that this product does not specify if it's  talc-free. I know it can show up as another name in ingredients so I'm worried about that. Overall, I would not recommend this to people with sensitive skin but would recommend this to people who can tolerate vitamin c and are prone to oiliness. I would also recommend that LC list talc-free on their product box if that is the case and if not consider launching a talc-free version."

It blends in beautifully and it feels like nothing on my skin. A really nice feature I appreciate it has is its non photo flashback. I did some test photos and had no issues with annoying powder patches of white showing up.

It provides a soft matte finish with a hint of radiance, which is perfect for achieving a natural, flawless look.  Color and Coverage: The rose hue is designed to brighten the complexion and add a subtle, healthy glow. It works particularly well for those with fair to medium skin tones, providing a slight color correction that helps to neutralize dullness.  Application: It applies smoothly and blends easily without settling into fine lines or looking cakey. Itu2019s recommended to use a fluffy powder brush or a puff for an even application. The powder also works well for baking, especially under the eyes to set concealer and prevent creasing.  Performance: The powder effectively sets makeup, extending its wear time and reducing shine throughout the day. It controls oil without drying out the skin, making it suitable for various skin types, including combination and oily skin.  Packaging: The product comes in a classic, sturdy container with a sifter that allows for controlled dispensing. The packaging is travel-friendly and looks elegant on any vanity."

When trying this product out I noticed even after a few days, it did not irritate my skin which is super awesome for a sensitive skin girl like me! For reference, I have a combination, leaning towards oily skin. I love the way this product was not too pink and smoothed while simultaneously brightening my under-eye. It held up fairly well throughout the day but I will say I use another pressed powder on top so be mindful of that. I did try this on a night out where people were taking flash photos and can gladly report, no flashback!!! All in all, this is a pretty good product if you are on the hunt for a new powder.

What impressed me most was the color and undertone, most pink powders run VERY pink or VERY peach this one feels like a happy middle ground of a subtle brightening effect that isnu2019t intimidating to the everyday makeup wearer. I think itu2019s definitely worth checking out if youu2019ve been interested in the pink powder trend!"

I've been using it every day since receiving it, and I really love this product!  It locks my base in place all day and gives my skin a gorgeous, smooth looking, light, pretty glow, with just a slight shimmery pink hue.  It compliments my fair skin tone very well.  The only thing I didn't love (and actually found a bit off-putting) was the fact that the box gives very specific instructions for how  to use the velour puff to apply the powder, but then concludes by saying that the velour puff is sold separately.  It brought me back to the days of receiving the toy I'd been hoping for all season on Christmas morning as a little kid, and then being devastated to read batteries not included written on the back of the box. Fortunately, other setting powders I own come with applicators included, so I used one that looked like it might be velour, and it worked just fine - as did a setting powder brush.  I took a star off for the lack of the applicator the box instructed me to use, but otherwise I think it's great!"

Here's a positive review for the Rose Translucent Loose Setting Powder:  ---  I recently tried the Rose Translucent Loose Setting Powder, and I couldn't be happier with the results! This powder is an absolute game-changer for my makeup routine. The translucent finish sets my foundation perfectly without altering its color, leaving my skin looking flawless and natural all day long.  One of the standout features is the subtle rose scent, which adds a touch of luxury to my makeup application. It's finely milled, making it easy to apply and blend seamlessly into my skin. I also appreciate that it doesn't settle into fine lines or pores, providing a smooth and even finish.  What I love most about this setting powder is its long-lasting effect. My makeup stays put throughout the day, even in humid conditions. It controls shine without making my skin look matte or dry, striking the perfect balance for a radiant complexion.  Overall, the Rose Translucent Loose Setting Powder has become a staple in my beauty routine. It's a must-have for anyone looking to achieve a flawless, long-lasting makeup look with a touch of elegance. Highly recommend!"

Honestly, I despised it and was reluctant to giving this new product a shot. But, Iu2019m absolutely in love with this blurring setting powder. It feels very silky on the skin and does not make my skin look aged or dry. My favorite trick is to apply it on the eyelids in this order: primer, foundation, setting powder, then eye shadow. It does not crease on my greasy eyelids all day long! I was having such a hard time finding a good setting powder and was just wasting money. So thankful I have this brand another chance and tried this blurring setting powder. Itu2019s been a game changer!"

I have owned a previous version where talc was among the main components and was extremely excited to try a new talc-free option. This powder is really a miracle. I have received it in the Translucent shade and this shade should work with every skin tone, this powder is not white, yellow or pink, itu2019s absolutely neutral. Powder fully matches the skin tone and is not visible! Itu2019s very soft, thin and gentle and feels like a transparent veil on the face. Powder smells u2026like powder, very classy and pleasant. It doesnu2019t dry the skin regardless of how many layers you put on, and this is especially important  for my dry under eye area. This powder last at least 4 hours and gives a  light shine for a healthy skin look, skin looks polished and velour-like. Highly recommend!"

I have used countless setting powders in the past, my very first being Laura Mercier to newer brands of this decade! I had not used a Laura Mercier setting powder in a while before this sample, and I canu2019t remember why I ever switched to other brands! This setting powder holds true on its claims of ultra blur; it is very finely milled and does not settle into fine lines. My skin used to be combination/oily but now it leans more to normal/dry. With other setting powders, I have struggled with them either being too cakey or settling into my fine lines minutes after application. That isnu2019t the case with this powder! In the image provided, I compare the Laura Mercier powder on the left which blends in beautifully to the skin, while the powder on the right cakes into my fine lines and does not smooth out, even after continuously trying to blend it out! This shade is Honey, but be aware that Honey in the Ultra Blur powder appears darker than Translucent Honey of the original setting powder. I am unable to comment on the color difference of the two, but this darker version appears only to be darker in the packaging, but not on your skin. Overall, I would highly recommend. Give this powder a try if youu2019re looking to add a new one to your routine!"

As a beauty enthusiast always on the hunt for the next holy grail product, I was eager to put this powder to the test. The texture of this setting powder is exquisite. It's incredibly finely milled, which allows for seamless application and blending. Upon application, it effortlessly blurs imperfections and sets makeup in place without settling into fine lines or emphasizing texture. One of the standout features of this setting powder is its ability to mattify the skin without leaving it looking flat or dull. It imparts a natural, skin-like finish that keeps oiliness at bay without sacrificing radiance.  I particularly appreciate the versatility of this powder. While it excels at setting makeup, it can also be used for baking or as a subtle mattifying veil on bare skin for a no-makeup makeup look. The translucent shade is universally flattering and suitable for all skin tones, making it a must-have in any makeup kit.  In terms of longevity, the Ultra-Blur Talc-Free Setting Powder delivers impressive results. My makeup stayed put for hours on end, with minimal need for touch-ups. Its finely milled texture, skin-perfecting capabilities, and long-lasting formula make it a standout product"

Plus, the fact that it has hyaluronic acid keeps my skin feeling comfortable throughout the day.

This is a great setting Talc Free setting powder for an overall luminous-but-not-sparkly finish. I included a photo comparing the Translucent shade to two other Talc Free, Silica based Translucent powders, over UD Face Tape Foundation and 3 swipes of Rare Beauty Liquid Highlighter in Flaunt.  The Laura Mercier preserves glow, but actually adds luminosity too so it is not mattifying. So it's not fair to compare it to the original which is mattifying. This provides a more 'hydrated' look! The AC one is mattifying while preserving any glow you've already applied. And the It one is even more matte and tends to diminish glow.  However none of these powders are bad, but just know what kind of finish you want and what you are buying and how you want to use it. I think the Laura Mercier is the best to set a more glowy look that you don't want to dim down.  Would definitely repurchase!   But I will say that the Deep Shade of this powder leaned a bit too orange for me. The tone of the deep shade definitely meshes in with your makeup. I will still use it but I just have to make sure I buff it out really well otherwise I can look like an oompa loompa in the daytime.  :-("

(I got it as a free sample with an order).  I don't set my face often, but when I do I prefer pressed powders. At every stage, every skin type I've had ranging from normal, combination, and oily, loose powders have looked horrific on my skin. I have large pores and they always settle into them rather than glaze over the top, and it ends up looking like whiteheads. Not the desired result. The last powder I tried was the Patrick Starr One Size powder, and I was ready to give up. This has changed my mind. It smoothes over the top of my skin seamlessly, blurs pores, sets my face and takes away unnecessary oil without removing the satin-y radiance I like to keep, and doesn't darken my foundation. I wear MUFE N110, Colourpop tinted moisturizer 2W, and Urban Decay Tinted Hydrator in 20. I'm pretty pale. And this keeps me that way. Love this powder!"

Of course Im familiar with the brand and have purchased the tinted moisturizer several times, but had not tried any other products from LM (not for any negative reason, just didnt need anything at the time). My good luck!  the sample was purse size, I threw it in there as soon as I received it, and was on a flight weeks later feeling that I looked as tired as I felt!   I put it under my eyes w my fingers and down the part of my cheeks that tend to get red due to mild rosacea.  WOW!   I felt like a new person!!  it was so unbelievable, I checked it in the airplane bathroom, the airport bathroom where I landed, my purse mirror in the uber!   lol!  On top of it, my destination was very humid and this stuff didnt budge!  Mind you, this was a sample, but a generous size sample.  It seems to be a layering type of powder, yet did not need re-applying, the only reason I did was to test the layering properties.  This formula seems great because even this the color is translucent it is more like adaptable to many skin tones and DEFINITELY controlled my redness, which is a constant battle.  Did not dry out my skin or feel caked on.  My skin DOES get dry and flakey at times, but this did NOT make that worse.  I am definitely going to order a full size right away (tonight actually!)  I am just wondering if it comes in a pressed formula.  but sometimes that doesnt work as well. I am considering to purchase some small container for my purse, or maybe use something like a contact lens container(?) Its great so far!!!!"

Iu2019m glad to say I have been using this daily for seven months, and Iu2019m still happy with the results! I have combination skin that is very oily in the t-zone and can also be dry and flakey. Before finding this, I tested other brands, but never found anything better than Laura Mercier. I used Laura Mercieru2019s regular translucent powder for years, and was excited to see this new talc-free version. During the summer I donu2019t think it kept the shine on my nose at bay for quite as long as the original, but it lasts longer during the fall and winter. I still need to use an oil blotter and touch up by the afternoon; however, itu2019s the best setting powder Iu2019ve found so far. It gives my skin a smooth, natural matte finish that I really like and doesnu2019t accentuate dry spots. I donu2019t need to use much to achieve the right amount of coverage. I hope this will eventually be available in a travel size. I highly recommend trying it!"
