This tiny vibrator is the size of my thumb, but it so high powered, -not to mention waterproof!- that it can keep me smiling no matter what is going on in my life. I can literally take it with me ANYWHERE as it's small yet durable silicone design allows me to carry it in a special pouch in my purse. It is super quiet, too. The people in the next room are not going to hear it and ask what is that sound?. The solid silicone sheath is what allows this to be waterproof for great fun in the shower/bath. Even the charger port is fully covered (feel for a tiny indentation on the bottom side of the vibe, and push the charger post into the indentation. Don't worry, it is designed for it!) And even better, it holds a charge for HOURS even with heavy use. It has 3 speed settings too. I will definitely be keeping this handy for those times when I need to relax and unwind."

I have always used them with my partner during intercourse. Hes never been the type to be jealous of a toy, just always being wanted me to have the best experience possible. I like the size because it is easy to hold and use during intercourse. You could easily pack it in your bag and I also like that it is waterproof. The price point is decent. I recommend it."
