Which means you donu2019t need to break the bank on every foundation or lipstick color!!

Ultimately these grease paint like colours are super pigmented (a little goes a long way), really bendable, and easily mixable for any custom colour for any creative look. Perfect for drag to even custom everyday looks (lips, blush, eye shadow base). These colours are not budge proof unless you set them. Use a velour puff or beauty blender to essentially bake the product like you would a concealer. This will mute some of the vibrancy however, but if you want the colour to last all day it's the only way."

I strongly prefer cream formulations for eye makeup, as they perform far better on mature skin (Iu2019m 40). No wrinkles for me yet, but the flesh around your eyes becomes more delicate as you age. Due to that and some oil control issues on my lids, I wonu2019t use most powder formulations. I was most excited to try the blue and green pots in this palette. Unfortunately, they were the most confusing. Unless I wanted to create a bold, avant-garde nighttime look, the blue and green have no use for me. They look very strange once applied. The other colors are lovely but I donu2019t need all those pink and pink-adjacent shades. Iu2019m giving it three stars because the formulation does seem excellent, though I imagine the packaging and the volume of product will cause dry-out over time. For $99, with no practical value for me personally, this had to be returned. Iu2019m interested in seeing the kind of looks others can pull off."

The color selections and the light compact case make it extremely alluring and practical for any make up junkie, from novice to pro. But unfortunately the quality doesn't match to its bolstering $99 price tag. At a first glance and swatch the color payoff is vivid and pigmented but the formula is really greasy and doesn't stay put. I've used lipsticks on my eyes and cheeks that have had a better blending and lasting power. I really can't see how this has gotten several raving reviews, and I urge MUFE to make the formula matte rather than creamy. Really disappointed."

You can apply this product with ease using any tool you should desire.  One huge downfall of the product is it does not translate well on eyes. It needs dry surfaces like the cheeks and lips to adhere to to stay in place. On the eyes, it creases and slips. I have tried setting it with powder, it just becomes cakey. I have tried priming the skin before application, it makes no difference and I have also tried mixing a gel mattifyer to the product in the hopes that it would soak up a bit of the moisture, it did not. The only thing I have not utilixed to rememdy the issue, is a sealant. If anyone has done so, please share your experiences below.  What makes this product stand out above the rest? This product is versatile; it can be used anywhere on the face and body and acts as a great base for making dull eyeshadows seem lively! The wide array of colours are perfect to add to a kit for professional use and work well in beauty, creative, fantasy and special FX looks.  The Nitty Gritty? As mentioned above, this product is not ideal for use on the eyelids. This item aslo has a hefty tag price retailing for $99. It was retailing at sephora.com for $110 CDN and since has been reduced to $99. However, it is still very expensive.  Final Summation:A must have for anyone who is serious about makeup. You will be pleased at the colour options and how vivid they turns up on film/digital format. With that said, don't however expect much in terms of wear on the lids."

I bought it a little while ago and recently I had been looking for great cream blush that was rich and bendable, After two unsuccessful buys I remembered that I had this! I used it and loved it and returned my two other blushes! I customized the blush to my taste. It's long lasting, I can make it as rich or as light or bright or as dark as I want. I read that it can be used to make your foundation, your eyeliners, lipsticks and eyeshadows. Although I'm not sure about using it just as shadows, maybe as a base, because in my opinion they might just crease on their own. They are super creamy!!"

It's a grease paint makeup set so if used as eyes shadow it doesn't really dry and will crease like crazy if you don't set it.

The red is the hardest texture. I feel like it's grainy sometimes but that's just comparing to others since they are very creamy. The reds and the pinks tend to stain. So don't put it directly on your eyes. (you are not suppose to it says in the back) but if you really want to put some base on your eyes before you tint them with red color haha.

As I read reviews on it I discovered they gave you these particular colors so that you can make ANY color you desire. This naturally piqued my interest so i decided to watch some youtube videos on it and study the color wheel a bit. After much research, I finally bought it. I have not regretted it once. This is one of those products i use everyday because it can be used for so many things. I love to mix custom eyeshadows with it. I have made several lovely purples from this palette as wel as beautiful blushes. When you use it as a blush, make sure you apply the color/mix very sheerly and blend well. If you do this it will look like a very naural stain on your cheeks ans will last all day. As for eveshadows, it will crease if you dont use it properly. When i apply it on my eyes, I make sure not to use an oily moisturizer or eyecream and I also apply UD Primer Potion. Then I apply my desired color very sheerly and blend it well before setting it with a powder. You can use a corresponding color of powder shadow or a translucent setting powder. When I do this it creases very very little or not at all. I would also like to say that the warnings about what colors can/cant be used on eyes or lips is only on there for the U.S. customers. I have sensative skin and I do not heed these warnings and I have had no problems at all. I have also used this palette as facepaint for a ball game i went to. I set it with powder and it lasted all day without smearing! This is a truly fantastic product that you can use for anything. If you are thinking of getting it, I would reccomend that you really do your research on it and make sure you play around with it alot at first. Once yu get the hang of it you can make any color for anyhing :)"

I tried everything: different primers, no primer, layering on top of shadows, powdering it down. I eventually had to admit defeat and return it. It was lovely, but it just wouldn't stay on, and when I applied the shimmery colors, the glitter fallout was ridiculous.  One note: I do have oily lids, so some products just don't work for me. The texture of this product is super-slick, not as creamy as I was led to think, and that may be the issue. I do have many other MUFE products, and I have no problems with any of those.

In the description it says it can be used on eyes, cheeks, and lips unfortunately on the back packaging some of the colors I either couldn't use on the eyes or i couldn't use on the lips. Also, some of the colors, no matter what I tried (especially the metallic), kept creasing. These colors weren't as long lasting as I would have liked. So I returned it because I had no use for it. I wouldn't have minded paying for this product if was truly worth it."

You can create almost any color imaginable by blending. Go and get yourself a color wheel and just experiment. You can create custom eye shadow, lip color, blush, eyeliner, eyebrow color, and did I mention foundation?!?? I mixed yellow, green, orange, and a touch of brown. It's insane. Some reviewers clearly have no idea you can do this as they keep saying these colors don't work on them etc. They work on everybody!!! Learn how to blend! And you need so little product that the palette is a steal for $99. It will last forever."

A little goes a VERY long way. Dab too much and you'll end up with a thick block of bright colour on wherever you dabbed it on your face.  The brown and white are great for contouring (used VERY sheerly), and the pink, red and coral are great for the cheeks. Obviously this palette can be used for the eyes as well, but that's just one of the many things this palette can do. I use the colours (such as black, blue, green, silver and gold) as primer sometimes -- If my base colour is green for example, I'll use a touch of green to really bring out that colour.  Overall, I'm very satisfied with this palette. The only thing I would say is a downside to this, is the smell -- it DOES smell a little strong. Also, if you have greasy skin this might not be the best for you, as it could make your skin even more greasy."

I used all of the colors on all the parts of my face...I didn't break out...I didn't go blind...I didn't explode or catch on fire...so it's really use at you own risk (but our big brother government requires the warning)...Also I have heard complaints that the color is not pigmented and that you don't get a lot of product..#1 a little product goes a looonnnggg way...and I mean just a tiny tiny bit..even smaller than a pea especially for the lips #2 If you blend out ANY product it will become sheer.. you can always just layer the product until you get the desired amount of opacity.

Depending on the event, I will set it again with the powder (see the Mud Run photo). It is easier to create designs with this than the Aqua Creams, which set quickly on their own. This palette has made a custom foundation to cover waxing bruises for a boudoir shoot, made intricate and abstract designs for fashion photography, and taken me and my running team through 10K of mud and obstacles."

I used it on eyes mostly for photoshoots, but use it for just about everything else when I do weddings including tattoo cover, color correction, and lipstick.

I didn't realize the gem I had picked up until I started going through the box. This was definitely one of the best finds... This is an awesome item for anyone who takes her makeup seriously. There's so much versatility in this palette. It can be used everywhere - lips, cheeks, eyes...  There are two metallics in this palette, a silver and a gold. The shades are all highly pigmented and can be mixed to make almost any shade imaginable. If you're a real makeup pro, this would be amazing to own. I'm also thinking this is excellent for me, because I get bored with specific shades quickly, and using this palette to concoct my own should be extremely entertaining to me. A little of this intensely pigmented product goes a long way, so as long as it doesn't get dried or crumbly, it should last for ages. The one problem I've had so far is that it creases even with primer and powder shadow over it, but I figured out how to make the creases part of the styles. As time goes by, experience will teach me how to get the most from this. Suffice it to say, for the time being, it's certainly fun to play with.  We got to a fair amount of theme parties. I sometimes end up buying products I'll rarely use, but this palette will allow me to make some of the shades I want, on my own. The only issue I've had so far is that this definitely needs powder so that it doesn't make a mess.  (Three colors can't be used near the eyes, and three can't be used on the lips. Please make sure to read directions in order to protect yourself).  If you're truly serious about your makeup, check this out."

I will say that these have quite a slip to them, they do not dry down to a powder, they remain creamy.

I would give this another chance and apply just a dab, it will still go a long way! :-D Good luck!  A Definite Must Have!!!!!"

It has so much product inside. This will literally last your whole life if you use like i do. I was a bit worried that it didnt have purple, but I found that you can create your own custom colors including a various amounts of purples and pinks and basically nearly any color of the rainbow by mixing the colors here. It is well worth it. and a little goes a long way. I use this mostly as a base to apply eyeshadow but there are millions of uses. I was thinking of collecting mac paintpots or MUFE single flash colors but this is less expensive in the long run. The colors are easy to mix and blend. The cost ends up being well worth it."

There are literally endless possibilities with this. I even blended a combination to make skin tone concealer, and I'm definitely no expert. My latest craze is experimenting with one of the colors as a base under my other shadows or lipsticks. This was worth my money!"

Downside is with or without a primer, if you use them alone as eyeshadow, they'll crease in no time, so definitely set them with a powder shadow!! Also, it's recommended to NOT use the salmon/coral, pink/magenta, or red colors on the eyelid, so definitely spot test before you use!! You get a ton of product for the price, and it will last a looong time. Make sure you call ahead before you drive down to your sephora, because 4 out of 5 times, they'll be sold out :< but if you buy online, you'll have no problems(:"

I use the gold and silver almost daily as a creamy base under any metallic shadow. using a primer helps it stay all day but even without a primer it doesn't travel, it just fades a little and actually I don't ind how it fades. The colors are super intense, almost clownish, so be prepared. But you can mix ANY COLOR. It's an artist's dream. one disadvantage is the shape of the container, because its a little tricky to get just a little product on your finger if you have long nails. but since you only need literally a tiny amount of this product to cover a whole lip or eye, i usually just dip the tip of my nail into it and scrape up a tiny roll of the cream like peanut butter. I then transfer it to the back of my hand where I can mix it with other colors or apply it to my eye or lip. Also, I have to note this doesn't give you acne, doesn't smell bad (had a light scent in container but not when you put it on) and you can really var the look with how much you apply, from a very light stain to an opaque look dramatic enough for theater. Really, of all the things ive bought on sephora this and my ghd hair straightener stand out as the best purchases that I can't live without!"

Using LORAC behind the scenes under the flash colors and MUFE high def powder on top, I've gotten this to last over-night (sleeping), all day, another night and again the next morning. After that, it starts looking weary! The powder gives it a polished matte look and keeps it from getting on my pillow and the primer keeps it stuck to my eyes. All in all, an amazing performance!  Incidentally, the person who said that any color can be mixed from yellow, red and blue is really only right in theory. With pure colors, it's more or less possible (not including the florescents) but these aren't pure colors. The yellow is actually kind of orange, and the blue is slightly red. Surprisingly, the nearest thing to pure blue in this pallet is the turquoise color, so you'll want to use that as a mixer instead. I'm not sure what the undertone in the black is, I haven't used it much, but all blacks have one, which is why brown is often used to darken colors instead of black. No matter what color you're trying to make, start with the closest pan (e.g. for green, start w/green, for purple, start w/fuchsia, etc) and then correct it w/other colors. Good luck and have fun with this!!"

Even subtle make-up (which I've never understood or bothered with) is interesting with this. Bright as a clown is a possibility as well; in fact, you to do anything with this given a bit of time to mix the right color. It's also great for fixing slightly off lipstick shades. Subtle effects like highlights on the bottom lip and a slightly darker top lip are as easy as pie with the colors at hand. It is grease based makeup, so smears easily and should probably be handled with care for these prone to acne. It will probably stay very well once I get some powder/primer things (currently it smears easily and disappears within a few hours, much less if I fidget). I seriously love this and have been playing with it constantly since I bought it.  For what it's worth, it's probably not waterline safe (made my eyes itch when I tried it). Also, the no coral, fuchsia and red around the eyes and no silver, white or dark blue on the lips are US recommendations only (and is the only part of the label not in French as well).  I loved that they included fuchsia (a notoriously difficult color to mix) and the coral color is a great shortcut (it's something you would have to mix individually very often if it weren't right there on the palette). The yellow is a tiny, tiny bit orangey but can still make subtle light-lemon colors by combining it with white and a tiny bit of the aqua color. Really my only complaint is the choice of greens. It's brighter than it looks in pictures, but it is still the sort of slightly muddy green that is relatively easy to mix. I would have preferred one of the bright emerald or jade greens that are much harder to mix, especially since the bright blue contains a tiny bit of red (not enough to see, but enough to make greens muddy!) However, the aqua mixes very well with the green and after some experimentation, I got a nice bright saint- patty's day color. The gold and silver are endlessly useful/fun and the brown is a nice neutral umber color which darkens beautifully without adding undertones.  My one warning is, when buying in the store, you might want to smell it first. One of my colors (the brown) was a slight bit rancid so I'm going to exchange it one of these days."

To me, MUFE is a dream come true to makeup fanatics. Hereu2019s some tips for this product: A little goes a long way. Do not be afraid to blend. My favorite combination currently is the coral, red, and yellow. You can use the black as an eye liner or to add that extra darkness and give you eyes more depth on the outer corner of yours eyes (remember to go VERY light on the black). Using cream shadows, you have to apply a setting powder or else it will crease. A friend of mine uses the MUFE HD powder since it is practically translucent. I use what ever power eye shadow I want to use that day. Remember to have fun and experimentu2014itu2019s the only way to learn how to do things your way. If you have oily skin like I do, then do not be afraid to use a primer underneath. I use Too Faced Shadow Insurance primer and then I add a quick coat of Bare Essentuals Mineral Veil to even out the uneven skin tone."

It looked absolutely gorgeous... the white made the color appear creamy. My suggestion is that you mix these (very) creamy colors with pure pigments, otherwise, you end up looking very cartoonish. Apply lightly, because again, if you apply too heavily... you look like a clown. I absolutely LOVE the silver glimmer shadow. I'm also not really sure as to what TOOL to use to apply this shadow. I tried finger, but it smudges too easily. I tried a regular eyeshadow applicator and it applied the shadow to places I didn't want it (above my lid where I wanted a lighter color) and ended up becoming a mess! Overall, I give this shadow kit a 3 out of 5 stars. It's going to last forever (only need to apply a little), but I'm not sure I'll be using it forever."

You have to play around with it and see what works for you, but once u figure it out...the results are great, and I get 12 colours in one easy palette whereas I would pay $22 for one colour You will never need to buy another one, because the portions of the eyeshadows are VERY generous (feel like i am talking about food now!)

Better than kryolan and the pigmentation is ridiculous. Use with setting powder if you want to go for a more demure look or better yet, set with loose color and pigments (mac pigments and mufe work together so well!). Pricey, yes. Worth it...totally! Easily my best make up purchase of the year."

I don't really care for the packaging but it is a good idea in order to keep them clean and I wish it was more air-tight. I hope they don't dry out quick, I have never used this product before, so I hope to find ways to use it. Also the red fuchsia and coral are not to be used on the eyes, and the white silver and turquoise are not to be used for lips I believe. Other than that I would buy if I was a professional artist.The most amazing thing I bought this year."

I do advise if you are new to this product to play around at first and experiment with different tools and brushes. To use for base, you will need to mix, blend and play around until you get the colour right. I suggest loking up a colour wheel online.  To ensure long lasting wear, set product with transluscent or loose powder.  This product takes me back to art classes and unleashes your inner artist. A definite must have and the only product you will ever need. Worth every penny."

I don't know if it's just me, but the Sephora picture was a little misleading. I thought the case was white but it is really clear plastic. It's not white guys! Haha"

Not an everyday kind of color usage due to the vibrant bold colors. Probably would be great as base also. A value purchase for the the product!"
