            "review_text": "This does its job by facilitating styling and creating texture. The scent is strong, like a clean floral but too much for me. Its hold is 5/10 for me. I sprayed it on dry strands pre-styling so that my curls would hold better, then after to set. Itu2019s really stiff and crunchy. As soon as I brushed through it, it was flexible and allowed manipulation, but my curls begin to fall and didnu2019t last the day. It leaves a lot of residue behind, so my hair wasnu2019t soft and smooth anymore. I even broke my poor hairbrushu2019s handle trying to detangle it at the end of the night. I had to wash my hair at the end of the day because it was so uncomfortable with a powdery film all over my hair. This may work well in situations where you spray and leave it, but I think there are better hairsprays out there for flexible styling."

The Living Proof Flex Shaping Hairspray is one of the few sprays that isn't overly sticky or weighs my hair down. I definitely appreciate that it extends the life of any hair do and use it almost every time I straighten my hair to add a little hold and combat fly-away and frizz. This products offers a light hold and won't help much with keeping hold on more complex hairstyles (ie: using a curling wand). Great for everyday use; minimal buildup. I would recommend to anyone looking for a natural feeling hairspray!"
