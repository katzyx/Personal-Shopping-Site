After 20 minutes you can already see the first result. After 60 minutes, I already had a nice and even tan."

St.Tropezu2019s self tan express eliminates all of my previous concerns with self tanners, resulting in a streak/mess-free application accompanied by a lovely tropical scent. I also love that the tanner dries down quickly so you donu2019t have to worry about staining your furniture or clothing! When applying the tanner, place a generous amount onto the mitt and rub into your skin until itu2019s completely even in colour. The tan will seem very subtle at first, but increases over the next 8 hours. I have fair skin and left the tanner on for 1 hour which resulted in a natural sun-kissed colour. I absolutely love this tanner and will be repurchasing again! (I received this product for free in exchange for my honest review from Skeepers)"
