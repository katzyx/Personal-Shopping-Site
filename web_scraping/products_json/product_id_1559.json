The smell was also interesting, it was a quite strong chemical smell with a hint of floral at first but dissipated quickly. The product also stung briefly when applied but again would subside fairly quickly.  All in all I probably would not purchase this again."

I love the scent (starts out strong and spicy, turns floral), and I love how it makes my skin look after a few days of use.

So either I have to blot off the excess oil (which of course is a waste) or wait until it all soaks in completely (2+ hours) before applying my makeup. Imho it's too oily to just put my primer/ makeup on top, and increases slippage. So while I actually love the effects, the formulation is not super practical for me.

I kept using the sample size bottle, a very generous one by the way, lasted the whole month and still have some left, and noticed very positive anti-aging benefits that were in the description of this product are true. In my case I've also noticed that the  fine lines that started appearing has diminished quite noticeably. As a result I've grown fond of the natural Ayurvedic scent of this oil and continuing applying it every night."

This oil - which to me smells more like vitamin c and is not as bad as people are saying - absorbs quickly, lessens redness and makes me glow. I use it in the morning after doing the rest of my skin regime and I follow it with my gua sha and my facial roller. Does it make my dark spots and acne scars disappear over night? No, because no product actually does that. It takes time and patience and more than just vitamin c oil. Yes this product may seem pricey but I've had it for 4 months, use 3 drops on my face a morning and it looks like I've barely used the bottle. A little goes a long way and this will last a long time."

Overall, my skin texture has improved a lot; however, the two results this serum touts are skin brightening and lightening dark spots, results I have not seen.  I still feel like my face, despite its even texture, has a dull quality, and acne marks from four or five months ago have not lightened noticeably even after using it daily for almost two months.  Maybe, I'll see better results after longer use, but I don't have the money to waste, tbh.  The purchase was a nice luxury experience, but I won't be buying it again."

It tingles and if you're sensitive, that could be annoying.   This will lower the pH of your skin so consider that when using with other products.   Also, the post recommends using this with retinol. That makes no sense as retinol reduces the effectiveness of Vitamin C. So if you're a fan of retinol (I am!) use this in the morning, as it won't cause you're skin to be more sensitive to UV rays."

However, I did one of the oxygen facials and the person who was doing mine used this on me and just avoided the eye area. I've been using this consistently for just over a month now and my skin has never been better. My skin is glowing to the Gods, I get complimented on it all the time. I've also noticed quite a reduction in my hyper-pigmentation. My skin is also super hydrated. The scent isn't overwhelming, I actually quite like it but it's not for everyone. I use this first, then put a couple spritzes of my Caudalie beauty elixir and Fresh Glow Nectar and I'm set for the day. I honestly never wear makeup anymore because of this combination. HIGHLY RECOMMEND."

I do not recommend it for combination or oily skin at all because it adds way too much oil to ur skin and clogs up ur pores; as a result I just breakouts after breakouts until I had to stop using it. Maybe I'll use it on other parts of my body like hands instead of face."

I normally use turmeric in my homemade mask to reduce inflammation and hyperpigmentation, and I like to incorporate vitamin C products to help protect my skin against UV damage. When I saw the ingredients and the claims I had to try it. And I am so glad I did.  I happen to have had a bad reaction to some skin product previously and broke out on one of my cheeks. My skin type normally gets brown spots for scars that seem to never disappear. The sale could not have come at a better time; the oil seems to have calmed my skin, and has reduced the appearance  of the spots.   I have only been using it for a couple of weeks now, twice a day, and my complexion is more clear, vibrant, and feels more hydrated. No bad skin reactions, and my spots have not disappeared entirely, but they seem lighter and my complexion seems a bit brighter; so I have hope. I use about 3-4 small drops for my entire face. I hope this will help me lighten my hyperpigmentation more with prolonged use.  This formula does not break me out, and it wears well under liquid foundation. I have tried about three different foundations and all have worked well together. It does not pill, or change the shade of my foundation. I put my sunscreen on top of this before my foundation. Everything works beautifully together.  I would highly recommend this face oil. I have combination oily skin, that is aging and has hyperpigmentation. I get hormonal breakouts."

            "review_text": "So I got this oil as a tiny sample about 2 weeks ago from Sephora. My biggest skin problems are that my skin stays pretty clear, but if I get one small problem area it spreads everywhere and then takes at least 2 weeks to calm down. Then after the acne is gone, the scars take weeks to go away and usually almost gone but then the next outbreak starts. I've been using my Avene Recovery Cream (from the pharmacy) and this oil together for the past 2 weeks and it's really helping with the scars. They don't look as dark as they normally do (especially the ones on my cheeks which are the worst). The scars are usually black and difficult to conceal, but they've become a brown that just a few shades darker than my skin tone now. With concealer now, they're almost invisible.   I'm excited to try a larger size. I use it mostly at night after washing my face with Aveeno sensitive skin face wash and then I add a thin layer of that recovery cream for added hydration. I sometimes just have the oil on a bare face if I'm just at home and it doesn't make it super oily, but I recommend only 2 drops for the entire face.   I have combination skin, my t zone is oily, my cheeks and jawline can become dry and start to crack after using acne-related products.   Will give it 5 out 5 once I try the larger size for more than 2 weeks! Hope the review helps!"

I just love the scent. It is fresh, herbaceous and almost like just cut grass. Really lovely.  It seems to have slightly reduced any pigmentation and I'm sure will continue to do so over time.

Unlike some other reviews, I happen to really enjoy the natural smell of this oil and admire that it isn't full of added fragrance like other skincare products. I noticed glowing results within the first week and love how well this product keeps my acne under control. Turmeric is an anti-inflammatory ingredient and makes my acne prone skin look hydrated and glowing. My cystic acne looks less red and less irritated which is usually really difficult to achieve. I have been using this oil in the evening with a jade roller to really help it absorb and in the morning I will put a couple drops on underneath my makeup. It's not always easy to trust reviews and not every product is going to be holy grail status for all skin types but if you have combination or acne prone skin I highly recommend trying this product. If you are having any doubts I would suggest buying the smaller size- it's cheaper, more travel friendly, and you don't have to worry about ingredients going bad over time like you do with the larger size!"
