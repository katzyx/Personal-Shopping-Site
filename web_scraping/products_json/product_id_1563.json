I live in canada and it's winter at the moment so I can't test it's power against the sun. But after reading the back of the bottle I think this sunscreen actually has zero sun protection. I shouldn't have to reapply a sunscreen every two hours for it to work especially with this price point.  And cover my body with clothing so I don't get burnt... it's summer I'm not doing that. Also the bottle sucks."

It comes at a pretty high price point so I wanted to see if there was something else I could use that's a little more affordable, since sun is one of my biggest triggers.   The consistency of this product is very different than most sunscreens and feels more like a primer. It spreads VERY easily and the normal 1/4 tsp that I use for my face, covered both my neck and chest as well. My makeup sat well on top and I liked that it was odourless.   The consistency is still weird to me, but I'll keep using it for now since it seems like my skin tolerates it well, it's more cost effective and fragrance free, which are all wins for me!"

I've tried many many sunscreens, both drugstore and high end, and the only one that came close to this was Khiel's gel sunscreen (linked below), but it's got a very high price point. I've tried the Supergoop play sunscreen and really enjoy it for my chest (which is also super sensitive and acne prone) - so I thought I'd take a stab at the Unseen Sunscreen, and I absolutely love it. The texture at first does feel a little thick, but it seamlessly blends into your skin and feels super lightweight once it's settled. The best aprt of this sunscreen for me is that my makeup look absolutely amazing over it - it doesn't feel like I've got sunscreen on, and it doesn't look like I've got additional layers underneath. I actually think this acts as a better primer than the Olehenrikson Banana Bright Primer (which I typically use on glam nights out).   Highly highly recommend giving this sunscreen a shot, I will definitely keep purchasing & this will most likely be replacing a lot of my other base products.   https://buy.cosmeticsnow.ca/iteminfo/kiehls-ultra-light-daily-uv-defense-spf50-60ml?ad_type=pla&target_id=1871050644393&ad_id=&utm_source=googleads&vt_keyword=&vt_campaign=21373082869&vt_adgroup=&vt_loc_interest=&vt_physical=9061030&vt_matchtype=&vt_network=x&vt_placement=&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=21373082869&gad_source=4&gbraid=0AAAAADhZK-xIRbVbKPOyA_zsIlF6ygPWI"

It leaves no white cast (of course), and blends overtop of my skincare really nicely. The texture is very silky on top of the skin which makes it appear matte while still keeping your skin feeling hydrated throughout the day. It can pill if you apply too much at once though!

I find it does have a slight mattifying effect and locked in my moisturizer well. There is no scent, which for me is a plus. As a retinol user, sunscreen is a must but it can be tough to find one that's non irritating, non-comedogenic and non-greasy.

Sprays, creams, gels all pill on my skin and usually make me look shiny (in a greasy way which makes me not want to wear them because my acne looks worse). I know that some people say that if sunscreen is pilling it is usually the order you apply your skincare on before, after, letting things dry, rubbing it in, tapping it in, etc. I have tried different ways of applying other sunscreens, sometimes one method helps but it still will start to pill the moment I perspirate.   I live in Canada so it's not usually super sunny through lots of the year but I do have very light skin and easily burn when it does get warmer. I'd heard good things about this brand before on social media but was unsure because of the price being so high for such a small quantity and not even knowing if I like it. Finally decided to give in and buy it though and even though it's expensive and this sunscreen is not shiny at all, completely clear so no white cast, applied without pilling and literally didn't even need time to set in.   Will definitely repurchase this once it runs out (even though it's expensive it's certainly cheaper than buying ones I'm not happy with) and will likely use my other brand ones as reapplies for my hands after washing or something just to not waste them. Exceeded my expectations and won't be buying any other face sunscreen. :))"

Also, because the lotion is totally invisible, while applying it on my face I couldn't tell if I already applied it on some spots/areas of my face, which might have caused me to apply twice or more on some areas.
