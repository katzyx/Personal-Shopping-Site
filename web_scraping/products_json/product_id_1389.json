It seemed to smooth out imperfections and gave my complexion a healthier glow. I was almost tempted to pile on more, thinking it would enhance the effect, but as I've been told with skincare a little goes a long way. Overall, despite being new to taking care of my face, I was impressed with this product. My after-shave now feels like I'm just applying filler - so I'd say this is product is definitely worth considering for anyone seeking to up their skincare game, regardless of gender."
