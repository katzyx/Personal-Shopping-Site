This formula dries out my skin and it feels tight and sticky when it dries. I am giving it two stars because my face appears less red than how Tatcha products make my skin. I was looking forward to this but I am so disappointed. If you have super dry sensitive red skin try Dr. Jart  Cicapair™ Sensitive Skin Moisturizer for Redness. It helps tone down red and has a pretty decent moisturizing feeling. I have been using it for a month i bought another tube already."

Firstly, the cushiony, whipped texture of this cream is luxurious and feels incredibly nourishing on the skin. It provides instant hydration that lasts throughout the day without feeling heavy or greasy.  Secondly, the long-lasting moisturization it offers is impressive. Clinically tested to restore the skin barrier, it retains moisture for up to 48 hours, leaving my skin feeling plump, supple, and hydrated.  But what I love most is the explosion of moisture it brings to my skin. Even after just a few uses, I noticed a significant improvement in my skin's overall hydration levels. It feels smoother, softer, and more radiant.  Plus, the added ingredients like peptide, ceramide, and squalane work wonders for improving the skin's moisture barrier and elasticity. My skin feels firmer and more resilient, with a healthy glow that I haven't seen in a long time.  Overall, the LG Beauty Belif Moisturizing Bomb is now a staple in my skincare routine. It's perfect for anyone with dry skin looking for intense hydration and lasting moisture. I highly recommend it to anyone in need of a moisture boost!  Thank you to Skeepers for introducing me to this amazing product!"

I tend to take hot showers, so my skin is usually dry and tends to flake. Sometimes during the day, I notice my skin feels flakey and starts to peel, but after using this moisturizer, my skin feels a lot more hydrated throughout the day and I don't notice any flakiness. This is such a great addition to my nighttime skin routine since I can wake up to soft and hydrated skin that will last me all day. Overall, I'd recommend this moisturizer if you have dry skin like me."

As someone with more oily skin, I was curious to see how it would work for me. While I can't deny its effectiveness in providing intense hydration, I found that the rich and creamy texture felt a bit too heavy on my skin.  Although the Moisturizing Bomb didn't quite suit my oily skin type, I can appreciate its nourishing formula, which left my skin feeling soft and moisturized without any greasiness. I found it worked better for me during the colder months when my skin tends to be drier.  In comparison to the Belif Aqua Bomb, which is specifically designed for oily and combination skin types, I personally found the Aqua Bomb to be a better fit for my skin. Its lightweight gel-cream texture provided the hydration my skin needed without weighing it down or exacerbating oiliness. The Aqua Bomb felt refreshing and absorbed quickly, making it ideal for daily use.  Overall, while the Belif Moisturizing Bomb didn't quite meet the needs of my oily skin, I can see how it would be a game-changer for those with dry to normal skin types seeking intense hydration. It's important to note that skincare is highly personal, and what works for one person may not work for another. If you have oily skin like mine, you might find the Belif Aqua Bomb to be a better-suited option for your daily moisturizing needs"

I then checked the jar and discovered that it had been reformulated and now contains many citrus and floral essential oils, all of which are known irritants, and even more botanical extracts. I'm extremely disappointed that Belif chose to add a slew of awful fragrances that provide no skincare benefit and even more so that I've lost a great product that worked for me.  Everyone's skin is different so not everyone will have the terrible reaction I did but be aware of the changes, especially if you are a long time Belif user. *The Moisturizing Eye Bomb now also contains these same essential oils and botanicals, which used to only be in the Aqua Bomb line."

			"review_text": "As someone with dry and sensitive skin, finding the right moisturizer has been a journey. I recently tried the belif Moisturizing Bomb, and I must say, it exceeded my expectations.  Firstly, the texture is luxurious yet lightweight, sinking into my skin effortlessly without leaving any greasy residue. This makes it perfect for both day and night use. Upon application, my skin immediately feels hydrated and plump, which lasts throughout the day.  I appreciate that it's formulated without harsh ingredients like parabens, sulfates, and phthalates, which can irritate sensitive skin. Instead, it's enriched with soothing herbs like comfrey leaf and oat extract, which help calm any redness or irritation.  One of the standout features for me is its ability to provide long-lasting hydration without clogging pores or causing breakouts. It's rare to find a moisturizer that strikes the perfect balance between nourishing dry patches and keeping oily areas in check, but belif Moisturizing Bomb does just that.  In terms of scent, it has a subtle herbal fragrance that dissipates quickly after application, making it suitable for those sensitive to strong scents.  Overall, belif Moisturizing Bomb has become a staple in my skincare routine. It's effective, gentle, and leaves my skin feeling hydrated and refreshed. I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a reliable moisturizer, especially those with dry or sensitive skin."

For that reason I was very happy to try this moisturizing bomb cream from Belif that promises deep hydration for up to 2 days and I honestly feel that its components leave my skin very soft and smooth. This cream hydrated me a lot and I continue using it at night, although it can also be applied in the morning to maintain the results. I like the aroma, it relaxes me a lot and the texture is more light than creamy. Furthermore, it is not a sticky or oily product, this is truly one of the great attractions for me. This product does work! It is completely recommended if your purpose is moisturizing your skin."

First impressions matter, and this cream does not disappoint. The packaging is sleek and elegant, hinting at the luxurious experience within. Upon application, the first thing I noticed was the texture. The cream is rich yet non-greasy, absorbing beautifully into the skin without leaving any residue. It’s a perfect balance for those seeking deep hydration without the heaviness often associated with more nourishing creams. The inclusion of peptides and ceramides in the formula is a game-changer. Peptides are known for their anti-aging properties, aiding in skin repair and rejuvenation, while ceramides strengthen the skin barrier, locking in moisture and protecting against environmental aggressors."

The moment I dipped my fingers into the deluxe sample from Sephora, I was met with a rich, creamy consistency that instantly signaled hydration. It's not often that you find a moisturizer that feels this luxurious upon application. The cream glided effortlessly onto my skin, enveloping it in a comforting embrace.

It has helped my dry skin feel more hydrated especially the changes in temperature and when it’s windy.   The texture is rich and luxurious, and a little goes a long way. It feels really hydrating without being greasy, which is a huge plus for me. I have sensitive skin, and I found that it absorbed well and left my skin feeling plump and nourished.  One thing that stood out to me about this moisturizer is the ingredients. The addition of peptides and ceramides is a nice touch, and I definitely felt like it helped improve the overall texture and appearance of my skin.  I also appreciate that it comes in a jar, which makes it easy to get every last bit of product out. However, I know some people prefer pumps for hygiene reasons, so that's something to consider.  In terms of effectiveness, I noticed an improvement in my skin's hydration and overall softness after using this product consistently.  Overall, I'd say the Belif True Cream Moisturizing Bomb with Peptide and Ceramide is definitely worth a try if you're looking for a deeply hydrating moisturizer that also offers some added skincare benefits. If you're willing to splurge a little, it's a solid choice."

This petite 10ml powerhouse proved that good things do come in small packages.  First and foremost, the texture of the moisturizer is incredibly luxurious. The cream is velvety and smooth, gliding effortlessly onto the skin. Despite its richness, it doesn't feel heavy or greasy, making it suitable for various skin types.  What truly sets this moisturizer apart is its intense hydration. Packed with the belif's signature Napiers Aqua Formula, it delivers a surge of moisture that revitalizes and plumps the skin. After application, my skin felt instantly quenched, and the effects lasted throughout the day.  Another standout feature is the subtle, refreshing scent. The fragrance is mild and clean, providing a spa-like experience during application without being overpowering or irritating for those with sensitivities.  The deluxe sample size is perfect for those wanting to test the product before committing to the full-sized version. It's also travel-friendly, making it a great companion for on-the-go hydration.  In terms of packaging, the sample comes in a convenient and sanitary squeeze tube, allowing for precise control of the amount dispensed. The packaging is also visually appealing, reflecting the brand's commitment to a modern and clean aesthetic.  While the deluxe sample may not provide a complete assessment of long-term benefits, my initial experience with the Sephora belif Moisturizing Bomb was undeniably positive. If you're in search of a hydrating moisturizer that combines effectiveness with a touch of luxury, this miniature marvel is worth considering for your skincare arsenal."

It effortlessly glides onto the skin, providing an immediate burst of moisture without feeling greasy. This makes it an excellent choice for those with combination or oily skin, as it effectively hydrates without clogging pores. One of the standout features of the Moisturizing Bomb is its impressive list of natural ingredients. The formula is enriched with comfrey leaf, a powerful herb known for its hydrating and soothing properties. This, coupled with oat extract and panthenol, creates a potent blend that not only moisturizes but also helps to strengthen the skin's barrier. I particularly appreciate the long-lasting effects of this moisturizer. Even in harsh weather conditions, my skin remained plump and supple throughout the day. It's a fantastic base for makeup application, as it creates a smooth canvas and prevents any patchiness. The product's packaging is not only aesthetically pleasing but also practical. The jar is sturdy and allows for easy dispensing of the product without any mess. A little goes a long way, so despite the higher price point, the Moisturizing Bomb proves to be cost-effective in the long run. In terms of fragrance, the moisturizer has a subtle and refreshing scent that doesn't overpower. This is a plus for those with sensitive skin or those who prefer skincare products without strong fragrances. In conclusion, the Belif Moisturizing Bomb is a standout product that lives up to its reputation. It's a reliable choice for anyone seeking a high-quality moisturizer that delivers on hydration, nourishment, and overall skin health."

From the moment I opened the jar, I was impressed by the cream's luxurious texture. It's rich yet absorbs beautifully into the skin without leaving any greasy residue. The addition of peptides and ceramides in the formula really sets this cream apart. These ingredients have worked wonders for my skin, leaving it feeling deeply nourished and visibly more supple. I've noticed a significant improvement in my skin's overall texture and hydration levels. Even during the harsh winter months, this cream has been a lifesaver, keeping my skin hydrated throughout the day. What I also love about this product is its gentle formulation. Despite having sensitive skin, I experienced no irritation. The scent is subtle and soothing, adding to the overall pampering experience. Overall, belif's The True Cream Moisturizing Bomb with Peptide and Ceramide is a fantastic product. It's effective, luxurious, and a pleasure to use. I'm genuinely grateful for having been given the chance to try it for free, and it has certainly earned a permanent spot in my skincare routine."

After cleansing, and using my usual pre moisturizing items, I applied this product on my dry skin. Let me just tell you my skin feels so hydrated and rejuvenated!"

			"review_text": "I love the Belif brand, but I was worried about trying this cream because it contains alcohol and the smell was quite strong. While the smell is unpleasant to me, it doesn't last on the skin which is nice. The alcohol didn't irritate my skin with a few applications so far, and actually the cream is quite thick and almost oily which is actually great for my very dry winter skin. If there was an unscented version without alcohol, this would be perfect for me and I could even use it year round in my dry state."

			"review_text": "The LG Beauty Belif Moisturizing Bomb is a true cream moisturizer that comes with Oak Husk and Vitamin B, which is good for dry skin, dryness, dullness, and uneven texture for normal, dry skin types.  Moreover, this moisturizer provides 26 hours of intense, long-lasting moisture based on a clinical study.    This cushiony, whipped textured cream provides dry and dull skin with intense 26-hours of moisture, leaving the skin feeling refreshed.  Moreover, this moisturizer is blended with Belif’s signature Napier's Moisture Formula, and so this rich cream is ideal for balancing skin’s oil and water levels by minimizing excess oil production and providing deep moisture to the skin with soothing properties.  I have already recommended the LG Beauty Belif Moisturizing Bomb to many of my friends and family and several of them have already purchased and used this cream moisturizer and are absolutely happy to see the results, as this cushiony, whipped textured cream provided their dry and dull skin with intense 26-hours of moisture, leaving their skin feeling refreshed."
