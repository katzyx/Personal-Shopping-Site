I would imagine these could work on any skin tone since they are incredibly pigmented. I now have the blushes and bronzer stick (the foundation stick was a bit of a fail for me)...I plan on trying more products from LYS. Great brand!"

You can swipe these sticks straight on to your cheeks for a bold look or use a brush to pick up color from the blush stick before applying it to your cheeks for a more subdued look.  You can easily twist up the stick to access more product and twist it down to secure it inside the cap so no blush accidentally gets scraped off the side.  The blush is velvety smooth and doesnu2019t dry down quickly so you have time to blend.  The finish of the blush gives a dewy, hydrated effect to the face.  There is no visible glitter or shimmer.  On my fair skin, shade Focused is a brick red."
