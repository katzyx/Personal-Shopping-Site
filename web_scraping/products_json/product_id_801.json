This is the second product that Iu2019ve tried in their Stem Cellular line and Iu2019m yet to be disappointed. After using this product over the past four weeks, I am loving the results that Iu2019ve been seeing. My skin appears to be much more hydrated and glowing. I did not mind the citrusy scent from the vitamin c ingredients but a word of caution - use sunscreen, as I had forgotten to do so and burned my face the first day I used this. Totally my fault!   I did very much enjoy the packaging with using a pump to access the product. One pump dispersed enough of the moisturizer to use on my entire face & neck. I would definitely purchase this product without hesitation and have already recommended it to a few folks already."

The product itself is great but the scent could use some toning down."

Iu2019m a big fragrance person and love scent, but the lemongrass almost has a skunk sent to it that I donu2019t like at all so I have to give this cream away unfortunately.

The first thing you will notice is the fresh, citrus smell.  I do not like scented products, but it is not overpowering and smells fresh, and the smell seems to dissipate once on the skin. In the short time I have used the Stem Cellular product I feel that my face looks brighter, and possibly a bit plumper.

            "review_text": "So I used this for 5 weeks two times a day and these are my thoughts:  As a person with sensitive skin, I found this cream to be non irritating and calming to my skin. I love that the cream is not super thick and spreads nicely and evenly on my skin. It has a fresh smell which goes away in minutes as the cream completely absorbs into the skin in minutes. Also, although they suggest to use the product liberally, a little does go a long way. The packaging is very nice and I like the pump dispenser. It's easy to get the amount of cream I need without waste. I don't have a lot of wrinkles, but I found my skin looked brighter and and was extremely well moisturized all day (and night with a second application after cleansing). Overall I really loved the cream, its definitely a luxury purchase but I would buy it with my own money and would recommend it to my friends and family who are looking for a face cream.  The only downside I can say is that with the pump dispenser, I can't tell when I'm almost done and need to get a refill."

After all, the product is an anti-wrinkle moisturizer but doesn't state it'd reduce wrinkles.  As a moisturizer it's not powerful enough on my very dry skin. Even in the summer, I've had to use vitamin E oil in conjunction with the product to keep my skin hydrated. So, unless you have oily or combination skin, this may not be the right product for you.  The product has a pump action to release the ideal amount of cream and keep the remaining product clean. I do like that function as it makes applying the product easy. However, I imagine there will be wasted product left in the container given you can't wipe out every bit of it. With that said, having used this daily for 3 weeks it hasn't run out yet.  The aroma will be a hit or miss with people. I love citrus so don't mind the really lemony scent. For some, they may find it too cloying and a bit like dish detergent. Perhaps reducing the scent or bringing it from lemon to more of a general citrus would be better."

I recently started using the Stem Cellular Anti-Wrinkle Moisturizer to work on my fine facial lines and dull skin. It has a lightweight, creamy texture and pleasant citrus scent. It's infused with plant stem cells and vitamin C and is free of parabens, phthalates & formaldehydes. It feels lovely and hydrating when applied to my face. There is a visible difference after regular use, and my skin looks brighter and smoother. I will be keeping it in my regular skincare routine!

Not sure about the anti wrinkle properties as it has to be used for months to see effects. I like that it does not make the face feel taut. The bottle has an easy pump top but sometimes the lotion gets dried up at the opening."

It absorbs well into the skin without leaving a greasy residue thus suitable for daily use and works well under makeup! I also loved the light, fresh scent which is not overpowering.   I did see noticeable improvements in skin hydration and texture after a week of daily use. It helped to plump my skin, giving it a more radiant and smooth appearance. Although the wrinkle repair is not that noticeable in such short time but I guess in a month or so this should show some improvement.   Overall I really liked this moisturiser for its clean ingredients and lightweight texture."

I prefer this formula as a night cream, as I feel it takes awhile for it to fully absorb (though it's not sitting wet, more like there's a little residue that goes away by morning).  It says that plant stem cells, vitamin C and Resveratrol are the active ingredients and I think those ingredients do make a difference over time, though for the short term it's just been a very nice moisturizer for me."

The natural ingredients and rich antioxidants give me peace of mind, knowing that I'm nourishing my skin with clean, organic products.What truly sets this moisturizer apart is its ability to visibly reduce fine lines and wrinkles. I've noticed a significant improvement in my skin's firmness and elasticity over time. The citrusy scent is an added bonus that makes my skincare routine feel like a luxurious spa experience.

I did not know what my skin was missing out on until now. It is lightweight but really hydrating. I didnu2019t realize how dry my skin was until I tried this product and saw how my skin just soaked it up. One of my main complaints is that I am starting to develop creping on my neck and I was becoming very self-conscious about it. After 2 applications of this, my skin is noticeably less crepey and saggy!  After about a week, I noticed that the marionette line around my mouth becoming less pronounced. The dispenser makes me feel like Iu2019m at a spa and I always feel pampered when I apply the moisturizer because of the subtle but fresh scent!  I have been using it for over 2 weeks and thereu2019s still a lot left because you donu2019t have to use very much.  I will definitely buy this in the future (just need to figure out what to do with the moisturizers I have that are not cutting it for me now that Iu2019ve tried this).

But it leaves my skin feeling moisturized and looking hydrated, without looking or feeling oily (which I realized my usual product was doing to my skin). I'm not a huge fan of the glowy look, so I was totally okay that I didn't get that with this. My skin looks healthy and it works beautifully under make up. The scent is so fresh and lovely. It reminded me a lot of Fruit Loops to be honest. The only downside of this to me was the price point. I am a bargain type lady, so this one scared me a little and made me not want to like it, but you bet your butt I am going to do what I can to justify this one! I will absolutely be recommending this to my fellow mature skin friends!"

It's part of my morning and night time skin routine, and I'm finding my skin has a natural, healthy glow without my skin feeling greasy or overly moisturized. My previous moisturizer lacked the glowy feel, and I sometimes had to apply more cream as my skin looked dull and dry.   I also like the lemon scent, it's not overpowering as other reviewers have mentioned, instead I find the scent to be very fresh and aromatic for your senses. I'm giving it 4 out of 5 stars because I think I need a good month of trying this cream to really assess the anti-wrinkle claims. So far so good, and based on current results I would purchase this product and recommend to friends and family. I also find you don't need a lot of product so this jar could potentially last a long time. My only feedback is the pump applicator inside the jar is a bit awkward in terms of how to hold the jar to pump cream. This is innovative as I've never seen this before for a jar container, and perhaps it keeps the product stay fresher in the container, but I think you need proper instructions on how to hold it. The first time I pumped way too much cream and had to leave some sitting on top of the pump to use for next time."

It hasn't clogged my pores or caused any acne.

It is a cream based moisturizer yet so light. A little does go a fair way, and it paired well with the serums that I use beforehand. You can also use this AM and PM. It does have a noticeable scent, but it is not overwhelming. If i had to describe it, it was a cross between grapes and berries. I would absolutely buy this again when I ran out of it. Highly recommended for anyone who is looking for a solid anti-aging moisturizer to round out your skincare routine."

The product has a refreshing citrusy scent that is not too overpowering. My skin tends to get dry during summer with the heat and sun rays, showing faint lines on my forehead and around my mouth so I was delighted that this cream helped to reduce the visibility of the dry patches and faint lines in one week of use after cleansing my face . The round jar is great as it comes with a nice pump that you press to deliver right amount of product for use without the need to contaminate the cream by inserting your fingers in the jar.I noticed a glow, a nice shine and less dullness too so I can highly recommend this cream to anyone looking for a good anti-aging moisturizer with nourishing ingredients which  works as a great base before applying make up too to provide the soft smooth skin ."

It has a fresh, citrusy, and natural aroma that is very pleasant, especially in the morning. It feels refreshing and invigorating, making it a perfect addition to my morning routine.  I also appreciate the container design. It's very convenient and hygienic, delivering the daily dose without needing to dip your fingers into the product. This helps keep the cream clean and ensures that each application is as fresh as the first.  The moisturizer itself is quite effective for summer use on my dry skin. However, I suspect it might not be heavy enough for the harsh Canadian winters. While I haven't used it long enough to see a very visible effect on my fine lines, my skin does feel smoother and a bit more plumped.  Overall, my experience with this cream has been positive.

You never have to guess how much product to use. Press the top and it squirts out the amount you need. It also keeps contaminants out of the jar. Just donu2019t be overzealous and pump vigorously like I did or youu2019ll end up with moisturizer all over the counter.   I am a big fan of lemon and this moisturizer comes in a fresh lemon scent. It applies like a dream and one dollop does my entire face and neck area.   Itu2019s important that me skincare is derived from organic and natural sources as much as possible. This moisturizer contains 70% organic ingredients.  It is also great for my sensitive skin. I have had no breakouts or burning while using this product.  My skin has been plump, and soft and very hydrated since I began using it morning and night as part of my daily skin routine. Iu2019ve also noticed my skin is less red (I have rosacea) Iu2019ve been able to got out this summer without throwing on a tinted foundation to cover the redness. Itu2019s a great bonus for me.  I will add this to my skin care routine once I finish this sample. I am throughly impressed."

Love the packaging, and that you pump this out, it gives you more then enough product with just one pump. Smell is nice, gave off citrus, lemon. The smell disapates quickly. I like the way it soaked into my skin, it isn't sticky, and leaves my skin feeling soft and hydrated, I don't think my face has felt this soft in awhile, and I've tried all kinds of different moisturizers and never been really happy with most of then even the expensive ones. It also didn't make me breakout like some of the others have in the past.   Although it is pricey, I feel like it did work for my skin and love it. I just wish the price was a little more affordable, I feel if it was more people would try it. I'm definitely considering ordering more when this one runs out, it might be a staple in my skin routine.   Thank you Juice Beauty for letting me try this product."

One of the best things about this moisturizer is the natural and organic ingredients. I love that I'm not putting harsh chemicals on my skin. It's packed with antioxidants and vitamin C, which have made a noticeable difference in reducing wrinkles and improving my skin tone and texture. After just a few weeks, my skin looks more radiant and smoother.  Iu2019ll admit, the price point is a little on the higher side, but honestly, it's worth every penny. The results are worth it, and itu2019s now a must-have in my skincare routine. Iu2019ve already told my friends and family about it, especially those who prefer clean beauty products. If you're looking for an effective anti-wrinkle moisturizer with great ingredients, I highly recommend giving this one a try!"

I just turned 40 years old so I have been more aware of my fine lines and wrinkles on my face. I was excited to use this product to see positive results. I used it for approximately 4 days consecutively in the morning after I washed my face. I took a before and after photo to see the difference. I noticed that prior to using this product, I had lines on my forehead whenever I smiled. After using this product a couple of days later, those lines significantly disappeared. They did not disappear entirely but there were less visible lines. This is good progress! I did notice that the scent from this moisturizer reminded me of citrus. I usually prefer non-scented products because I have sensitive smell. It only slightly bothered me at first because it gave off a strong citrus scent. After a couple of days use, I just got used to it. However, if it was lightly scented or non-scented, I think I would have rated it higher. I look forward to continuing to use this facial moisturizer and hopefully I will see long-term positive results. Here's to looking young!"

I have to be honest at first I found the smell a little overpowering (lemon) but after a week I actually came to like it. It is super handy with the little push pump too! Its not a heavy cream but it is thick and silky. Absorbs very well and my skin is looking plump and visibly has less fine lines. Overall it is a great product and I would def recommend giving it a try! Thanks! Sophistosassy"

However, after a while of everyday use I noticed that it was causing some redness, irritation and dry tightness in my skin. So, I stopped and did some reading to figure out what was causing that because the first few weeks I had been ok. Some people suggested to try and only use it 2-3 days a week and see if that goes back to being ok. So that is what I have been doing and so far, it is working. I do want to finish the jar to give it a chance to see the anti-aging benefits. If you have sensitive skin just be aware of that but if you have normal skin this will probably be a nice cream for you."

As someone with sensitive and reactive skin, I was initially cautious about trying a new product. However, this moisturizer has been a pleasant surprise, with its sensitive-skin-friendly ingredients like shea butter, vitamin E, and aloe juice.  One of the things I appreciate most about this moisturizer is its lightweight formula. It provides just the right amount of hydration, making it perfect for daily use. I particularly enjoy using it as a base for my makeup, as it adds a subtle glow to my look. Plus, the light scent is refreshing and makes the entire experience even more enjoyable.  If you have drier skin, I recommend using this product as a first-step moisturizer or in place of your serums and then applying a thicker cream to seal and protect your skin. I do this on cold Canadian winter days, and it works wonders. I also brought this product to Florida on vacation and found it perfectly hydrating in the warmer weather.  Trying out this product has been a pleasure, and I wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone looking for a moisturizer that nourishes and makes the skin glow."

I do like some aromatherapy in my face products but the pay off for performing with it. The pump is great in that it dispenses how much you need. Without it I might have been using less and probably not enough. The only thing I would criticize about it is that it leaves residue behind that hardens and you need to wipe it off when you next use it. Still it gets 5 stars."

Very uplifting in the morning but I can see fragrance sensitive people not liking. That's my main reason for deducting a star since it's pretty strong. I totally don't mind.  It has one of those push top lids and I'm not a super fan since alot of product can be wasted and I have to actually break open the container. It is very light though and absorbs quick into my skin without residue. I had no tight feeling and while my skin felt moisturized, it wasn't overly heavy. I wore at night and day and make up went over the creme just fine.  It's a high price point but the ingredients are quality and it's not animal tested which is nice. It's clean.

It replaced my current moisturizer for ten days, using the full 50ml jar in that time. I liked that the formula was organic, had vitamin c, was loaded with antioxidants and plant stem cells to combat dryness, uneven texture, fill lines and wrinkles, brighten and tone skin overall. My skin has been dry with lines, wrinkles, sun damage and an uneven texture and dullness. I used this product twice daily under makeup and at bedtime. The formula was nice and light, non greasy and my skin soaked it up. It had a light citrusy scent and felt like menthol on my skin. Like no other moisturizer Iu2019ve used, this felt so good on my skin. It was the perfect base for makeup and I did not have to touch up or reapply during the day. I used to have to double cleanse at bedtime but did not have to while I used this moisturizer. Iu2019d apply this again at bedtime and did not feel the tight, itching feeling on my face like before.  After Iu2019d used the whole product I have to say that it did indeed feel plump and hydrated, my skin is smooth, feels and looks soft, even and bright, fine lines are less defined. I am not surprised that this formula worked for me considering how well itu2019s ingredients targeted my problem areas, and in the short time I used it. I will continue to use it and recommend to everyone with dry or combination skin types because it worked so well for me."

I am 40 years old, have dry skin and visible signs of aging, like fine wrinkles, some redness and discoloration and a few dark spots. I have been using this product in the morning and evening for 10 days, without any other products that I usually use. What I really liked about this product is its ingredients list, it does not contain any harmful chemicals. It has a mild citrusy smell (which I liked) and a medium rich consistency. I felt that it needed some extra time to get completely absorbed into my skin. I have also felt a tightening feeling on my skin after a few minutes of applying. As I have only used it for several days, it might be too soon to tell, but what I have noticed is more even tone of my skin and reduction in some of my dark spots. My skin felt hydrated after, even a bit greasy. If you have oily skin, you might not like this product. I have not noticed any visible signs regarding my fine lines and wrinkles yet, but I did not have any expectation in that area anyway, as I do believe there is nothing that can be actually done with cosmetics alone (without using fillers or Botox). The downside of this product is its price. The products I was using before trying this one did not cost as much, but on the other hand, this one did outperform in the areas of discoloration and dark spots reduction. So, if you want good product with quality ingredients and your main area of worry is hydration and dark spots, I would recommend trying out this product.   The left picture was taken before trying the product and the right one was taken after 10 days of continuous use. I did not wear any make and did not use any filters."

I was super intrigued to try the STEM CELLULAR Anti-Wrinkle Moisturizer, which promises to combat signs of aging while nurturing the skin with potent botanicals and plant stem cells.   First and foremost, the packaging is so elegant and practical - the moisturizer comes in a sleek pump bottle, ensuring hygienic dispensing and easy application. The texture of the cream is luxurious and quite thick that glided effortlessly onto my skin. It absorbs quickly without leaving any greasy residue, which is a big plus for someone with combination skin like mine. One of the standout features of this moisturizer is its formulation. It's made with organic ingredients and plant stem cells derived from fruits like grapes and apples, which are rich in antioxidants and nutrients. I did an in-depth check of the ingredients and it is absolutely packed with emollients and humectants, mainly oils, which is extremely nourishing to the skin. At the same time, these comedogenic ingredients can be triggering for those with oily skin prone to fungal acne.  I started noticing visible improvements in my skin's texture and tone after just a week of applying it day and night. My fine lines appeared less noticeable, and my skin felt firmer and more hydrated overall. What impressed me the most was the long-lasting hydration it provided throughout the day. This is definitely a premium product, but a little goes a very long way! I'd say it's worth the investment."

It feels like the product actually absorbs into the skin.  Cons: Does have a greasy feel. I hate the packaging, it is not a container or pump you push down on it and the product comes out of the top through a hole- it doesn't seem the most sanitary. Will I purchase in the future ? No."

The texture of the moisturizer is creamy and dense, it absorbs quickly, leaving a delicate feel on the skin. It has a very fresh citrus scent, but I find it slightly overpowering.

It gives off a luxurious vibe, making it a worthwhile investment for anyone seeking effective skincare solutions.

Upon application, I found that a small amount of the product goes a long way, thanks to its lightweight formula. It absorbed quickly into my skin without leaving behind any oily residue, leaving my skin feeling soft and hydrated. However, I did notice a strong citrus scent, which may not be suitable for those who prefer unscented skincare products.  I enjoy the invigorating citrus scent. In terms of performance, I was impressed by its ability to improve both skin texture and tone, in addition to targeting wrinkles. After using it consistently before bedtime, I noticed a noticeable improvement in the overall radiance and suppleness of my skin.  I would buy the product again."

The cream absorbs really well, not greasy or pilling.(I have not used this under make up, so I canu2019t say how that would sit.) I appreciate that it leaves my skin very soft and smooth without any residue quickly after application. I found it to be quite soothing as well when I used it post a BBL treatment, and my cheeks were quite red and irritated/hot. The amount of moisturizer that automatically comes out is perfect for me, but the container easily opens if you prefer to scoop it out as well.

I love that it dries quickly and that I can't feel it on my face, unlike other moisturizers that leave your face sticky. The only dislike I have about this product is the packaging - it is confusing. The way the lid is made, it has multiple pieces and its easy to incorrectly open the inside of the lid instead of the product. The inner ring keeps falling off when I open the product and I am unsure of whether I need to keep it or not, as it fits around the dip in the lid. I don't know if the ring keeps it from leaking or whatnot.

It was the first thing I noticed it when applying the moisturizer to my face. It was a citrus scent that reminded me of the polish cleaner that you would use to varnish (the scent was very mild but very scent still very distinct in my own opinion)"

I've tried many moisturizers that are on the market and this now sits in my top three. I'm in my early 40s and I've definitely noticed a lot more fine lines over the last couple of years. I have been using this as my night cream and I am really enjoying it because it actually makes my skin feel really supple. Especially this time of year, my skin is so thirsty for moisture so when I use a night cream, I usually wake up and my skin still feels tight. However with this, my cheeks still feel as juice-y (see what I did there) as they were when I apply the cream. I have noticed a slight difference in the areas that have more fine lines as well. I'm hoping with continued use, they will be less obvious. The cream smells delicious but if you are sensitive to scent it might not be for you. It is definitely more of a night cream though and would be a little heavy for day use under foundation. Having said that, if you need that extra moisture during the day, just use less. A little goes a long way with this product."

It works well under makeup, leaving a smooth finish. I did notice that my T-zone became shinier more quickly while using this moisturizer, but it wasn't enough of a problem for it to detract from my overall positive opinion. I really enjoyed the citrus scent of this product, although it may be a bit strong for those with sensitive noses.  I love that Juice Beauty's products are cruelty free and that they use natural ingredients. The container is well-designed and easy to use.  I would definitely recommend the Stem Cellular Anti-Wrinkle Moisturizer to anyone who has dry or combination skin. I will definitely be purchasing this for myself tonjse again in the future"

For the price though not sure I would buy it over some other creams on the market at a similar price point. Thatu2019s said the ingredients are clean, efficacious and efficient and it smells so damn good. Worth testing out of you want to treat yourself to a splurge.

I have pretty dry skin, and I found that this was not heavy enough for my winter dryness, so I will save the remainder of the product for the summer when I prefer a lighter-weight moisturizer. It does have a strong citrus scent, but it did not irritate me. I think many customers will enjoy the pump-style packaging of this product, as I often read reviews where people say that they donu2019t like sticking their fingers into little pots of product. I prefer the pots, as I like to know that Iu2019m getting every last drop of product. Obviously, having the Clean at Sephora stamp of approval is a huge plus.  I do recommend this product and look forward to going back to it in the summer."

I donu2019t have very many wrinkles and didnu2019t notice a huge difference there but perhaps with long term use there would be an improvement.  I love the container. It has a pump so you arenu2019t wasting moisturizer and you can unscrew the top when it gets too low for the pump and use the remainder from the container.  The cream was hydrating and did smell wonderful but I am not sure if I will purchase for long term use as it is expensive."

I love it. I received the Anti-Wrinkle Moisturizer from the Influenster in exchange for an honest review of the products. I must first note to you all that thia product is organic, vegan and cruelty-free.  I used the Anti-wrinkle moisturizer every morning for the past few weeks. The color resembles light green tea and when I apply it, it feels light and non-oily. It absorbs into the skin relatively quickly though I would not recommend just relying on this one product to moisturize your skin for the day, especially during winter. It would probably be better during summer.  In the short term, due to the retinol, I did notice some flaking at first but it got better as time progressed.  I did also notice that the lines on my face decreased. Overall, I'll give it a 4/5 for now."

Product smells glorious in what I would describe as a lemon verbena scent, very fresh! Product glides on easily and soaks right into your skin leaving face dewy and what I would describe as almost lightly matted.  Used in combination with the complementary overnight serum, after using  this for almost a month, Iu2019ve noticed a smoother and more even appearance to my skin.  I donu2019t have to wear makeup over this my skin looks so good,  just a dusting of mineral sunscreen and Iu2019m glowing.  Noticed a definite difference in the plumpness of my skin!"

This is a great moisturizer, everything from texture, absorbency on the skin, fragrance, and ingredients makes it a DEFINITE new favourite on my skincare list. I have very fine lines that are almost not there anymore after using this moisturizer for about a month now! I will definitely repurchase. My one and only con is that it doesnu2019t have SPF in it; so what Iu2019ve done when using it during the day is just mixing it with my regular face sunscreen (:"

The pump was my favourite part, it was sanitary and resembles the Drunk Elephant moisturizer packaging. The scent was nice, light citrus scent. My last moisturizer did not have fragrance so it is a nice switch up. In terms of moisturizing, I donu2019t think Iu2019ve used it long enough to see the full benefits, but it absorbed nice and paired well with the serum. For an extra kick of moisture I paired with a hydrating sleeping mask! Overall I enjoyed using this product and would repurchase!"

My favourite thing about this moisturizer is the dispenser; it's a sanitary pump, helps preserve the active ingredients, and helps you measure the amount you actually need for your face. From the onset there is a strong citrus smell after applying but it does seem to fade away within 30 minutes. The moisturizer has a nice texture and does get absorbed by my skin nicely. The reason I can't give this a full five stars is because my skin starts to feel tight and dry within four or five hours after I apply it. It could have to do with the face that I live in a cold climate and this moisturizer might preform better for me as a summer product instead."

But It definitely has made my skin more plump and hydrated, I do not have a large amount of wrinkles or fine lines but I do see that it has made a difference in my smile lines with regular use.   I live the smell of it - bright and citrusy, like apple like or something.  It does a great job of moisturizing and keep the skin looking fresh ans plump.   I did receive this product from Influenster for my reviewing purposes but all opinions are my own."

This moisturizer does have a strong lemon scent , I honestly donu2019t mind it at all and it reminds me of a scent from my childhood that I canu2019t put my finger on.  The pump delivers the perfect amount of moisturizer for my face an neck, it is a very thick consistency. It leaves me hydrated with soft skin. I havenu2019t seen a huge improvement with wrinkles as of yet but as itu2019s only been a month. This is only getting a 4 star as the scent makes it unusable to consumers that are highly sensitive to scents in skincare. . .
