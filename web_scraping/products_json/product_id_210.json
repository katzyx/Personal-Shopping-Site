GOOD GIRL is a sensual, evocative fragrance born of the beautiful contradictions and the ever-present duality of modern women and modern life. Both freshly light and moodily dark, this innovative fragrance captures a womans wondrous complexity with surprising and exceptional ingredients. The sweet, alluring qualities of jasmine give GOOD GIRL its brightness and femininity. The darker side is created with richly fragrant cocoa and intoxicating tonka. Almond and coffee bring the scent its immediate vibrancy. Tuberose, extracted in a new way that creates a rich delicacy, is the fragrances wild card, bringing fluidity and femininity. GOOD GIRL exemplifies the effortless elegance and wit of the House of Herrera...The ground-breaking bottle, the first in the form of a high heel, speaks as eloquently of the power of modern femininity and a womans dual nature as the fragrance itself. Made of sleek, smoky, midnight blue glass, it stands on the tallest, thinnest gold heel...Give a girl the right shoe and she can conquer the world.u2014Carolina Herrera de Bu00e1ez, Brand Founder",

I find myself spelling my arm when I wear it because I quite literally can not get enough of it. It is perfect for all occasions but especially those events that you want to feel sexy, put together and confident at. It smells amazing right out of the bottle but even better once its settled and mixed in with your natural pheromones. I wish I could gift this to all of my friends because it is absolutely perfect. This has become one of my signature scents and I could not be happier. Highly recommend. Even if you cant afford an entire bottle please get the sample / travel size. You wont regret it."

Each time I went in store I always attempted to smell it again and eventually I gave in and purchased the mini. Im now obsessed.

The story that Good Girl tells is one filled with duality, offering a sense of sensual play with a hint of mystery. It holds a balance between a friendly smile and captivating gaze; its the classic tale of unrequited love or a love that keeps you wanting and needing more.   It has a delectable, almost forbidden sweetness to it buried in the whimsically curious tones of bergamot and musk. It has a mature and even toned presence thanks to the grounding notes of coffee and sandalwood, with the feminine addition of geranium rose and jasmine. The base notes of cacao, praline & vanilla make it approachable allowing for the alluring desire it creates to pull others in. This is the fragrance of a women who knows what she wants.   In my experience, its long lasting with notes that are still detachable with 6-8 hours of wear time or more, especially with well moisturized skin. It has a moderate to strong silage leaning more toward moderate, those around you will be able to pick up the fragrance but its not overly vivacious. I wouldnt place this scent in any season category but it does carry a flirty and zestful demeanour so it feels more romantic and evening friendly than it would for the office.  This is a fragrance for any woman whos heard the term u201cu2026 but you look like such a good girl.u201d"

The high heel bottle is elegant and makes for the perfect decoration. Even when my bottle is empty I will be keeping it because it looks so neat! The bottle itself is a mysterious smoky midnight blue glass and the sleek gold heel is the finishing touch! I spent years walking around Sears during the holiday season demoing fragrances so I like to think I have some knowledge when it comes to fragrances and Id have to say this one would be a top seller this holiday season and beyond. The scent itself is sweet yet not to sweet. Its in the floral family and its key ingredients are Tuberose, Jasmine & Tonka Bean. On first spritz I absolutely loved the scent but found once it dried down it wasnt the absolute best scent for me. As with most fragrances it reacts differently once its on your skin. Thats why some fragrances smell differently on each person. Ill still wear it just not an every day scent. If I spray it on my clothes it still smells beautiful just remember not to spray all perfumes on white clothes because some fragrances can stain white or light coloured clothing. Another great thing about this fragrance is the scent lasts all day. In all I think this is a wonderful fragrance and the bottle itself offers a fantastic curb appeal!"

I would say this is a sophisticated perfume and would recommend this for women looking for a bold, every day scent. Its bold and the smell lingers even after wearing it for a few hours. I like this scent, its not a usual scent I would choose, I usually prefer a sweeter warmer scent, not as spicy. But I feel this is a great winter scent!"

It can be a statement decor once the fragrance is finished.   Ive been wearing the fragrance for almost two weeks and Ive been complemented almost every time Ive worn it (my fiance complemented it the first couple times saying I smell nice and now I think he has gotten used to the scent).  My mom and best friend like the scent, too, so I think it works well with my body chemistry.  Truthfully I didnt think I would like the scent as much as I do now.  For me, I find it sultry and sexy and I, for personal presence, would gravitate to fresh and light scents but this is definitely classy and would wear on a night out or a formal occasion."

The bottle has some real weight to it, making it seem expensive. On the negative side, the bottle has a bigger footprint than the typical cylinder or rectangle bottle. Its also a bit awkward to spray with one hand due to the placement of the mechanism. in terms of the fragrance, I would say that it smells like a standard perfume. The scent is mainly Jasmine and it is definitely feminine. The scent is floral without being cloyingly sweet. I sprayed it on my wrist as well as paper to test the staying power. The paper one was still going strong 6+ hours later. The one on my wrist had significantly faded and only a faint trace was left after the same amount of time, probably due to the temperature of the skin. Therefore, I would suggest to apply it accordingly and apply it to the hair or clothes rather than the skin if you want something stronger. This would make a great gift due to the novelty of the bottle."

Good Girl opens up with soft almond and coffee notes with some fresh citrus. I can also almost instantly pick up on the beautiful Jasmin Sambac note, which adds an elegance. The silage of this fragrance is amazing for about 3-4 hours and then it becomes a body scent that requires someone to be up close to smell. I can continue to smell it off my clothes for a while. Although I love this fragrance, it is not an original scent. When I first sprayed it, I knew I had smelled something close to this before. The scent is not unique, but the bottle sure is. I would definitely recommend this as a gift to someone who is just starting out getting into fragrances. Its a great arsenal to have in your collection just for the design of the bottle alone!

            "review_text": "Good Girl is a lovely, complex fragrance.  Upon first spraying it, I was hit with an alarming alcohol smell that faded nearly immediately into a jasmine and citrus infusion. A little bit of lemon, and something bordering on bergamot. After this upper layer fades, which happens fairly quickly. the perfume moves into it's more enduring notes, which are much more gourmand. Starting with an almond note, and then into a heavier coffee, cocoa, praline, and slight floral mixture. It has a very heady musky sweetness. It reminds me of a really lovely incense. It finalizes with a woodsy, cedary smell, that is a little spicy and even more musky. These final notes really only make an appearance when the fragrance is sprayed on clothes, where the longevity is much longer than when sprayed on the skin. However, personally I preferred the way the perfume wore on my skin as compared to clothes.   So who is this fragrance for? It is certainly feminine, however I think some men and certainly non-binary folks could really love this. It has a really lovely gourmand/floral sweetness to it, but it's also heavy, mysterious, complex, and deep enough to skew unisex. It could be either mature or youthful depending on the person wearing it- no age barriers in my opinion. I would definitely stick to wearing it in cooler temperatures, as I think that same musky heaviness could be a little overwhelming in warmer temperatures- unless of course wearing a fragrance with a beastly sillage to some hot sweaty club is a power move for you, in which case this is totally the ticket.   In terms of the packaging, there's more to it than the ICONIC shoe design. The sprayer is fabulous! It has, legitimately, the smoothest, most satisfying spray I've ever experienced.   I think there are people this frag would be too much for, honestly, and so for that reason I can't recommend this as a completely blind buy- if you know that muskier frags can be a headache trigger for you, I'd steer clear."

Its a bit cacophonous; and it sounds the same from the beginning till the end. Just fades away without any changes. The longevity is moderate. On me it lasts for about 4 hours. The silage, Id say moderate to intimate. Maybe if you overspray it, it can be choking. But if you use a couple of sprays, it sits pretty close to the skin. If you love gourmand fragrances that arent intoxicatingly sweet, with some freshness and spice to it, you might like Good Girl. And, of course, the bottle is beautiful."

I am normally attracted to floral musk scents or citrus scents in the summer. This has floral notes in it, and a sweetness and a depth that's hard to put my finger on. To my surprise, it ended up being unintentionally accessible/disabled friendly. They trigger spray makes it very easy for someone with limited dexterity, to be able to spray it. PROS: -Great packaging -Unintentionally accessible -Unique smell -Good for a day or night -Longevity CONS: -Unique sweet smell The jury is still out on this one. I'm going to live with it a little bit longer before I give it a thumbs up or thumbs down, but it does have a lot of pros."

I dont get a whole lot of the floral scent from the jasmine. Very slight musky/amber notes. The almond comes through very nicely, making it a rich almost decadent scent. It is rich, but not over powering where you youd feel overwhelmed. It does last on me for quite a while. The strength does dissipate a little over time, but not so much where I cant smell it at the end of the day.   If you are considering a fragrance as a gift for anyone, I think this would be a great option for the upcoming holidays."

I love all things that smell good perfumes, candles, room sprays. It has the perfect scent that I just can't put my finger on it. My friends say it smells like a modern clean home. I give this a 5 out of 5 :)."

I have been on the hunt for my signature fragrance and this is the first one on my fragrance journey and I have since got several minis and samples but I keep coming back to this one. I lean more towards woody and spicy with a hint of sweetness fragrances. And this one hit all marks in an unexpected way. I cant stand most floral fragrances but the floral notes in this are balanced so well with all the other notes. Its definitely mostly warm sweet but not overly so the dry down (my favorite part of all fragrances) is soft woody vanilla. I can smell the few floral notes all the way through but more in the back ground which gives it some complexity. The coffee and almond isnt over done either like black opium. I like black opium too but its almost too sweet like when you accidentally put too much sugar in you coffee but Good Girl is balanced soooo well! I love it so much I just wish all those great notes lingered a little longer like my long time favorite and old signature fragrance decadence."

Everyone will ask you what you wear.  It's unique but feminine. Dark and erotic smelling, this scent will leave everyone around you drooling. It's ironic that it is named Good Girl when I imagine the women to be wearing this to be provocative, dark and sensual. If you like to smell strong, unique and sexy, buy this.  The full size bottle is stunning but always buy a roller or sampler size first never blind buy babes!!!!"

It is definitely sweet but well-rounded by the floral notes and the cedar/patchouli in the base. Especially appreciate the almond note, though. It is one of the most detectable notes to my nose. Its a more earthy almond rather than sweet and marzipan-y. In addition to almond, I most prominently smell coffee, cacao, and praline. There is A LOT going on in this fragrance's composition, but somehow it works. I find this to be a pretty unique scent as well. In my opinion, it is best for cooler weather, most suitable for nighttime, but pleasant and not too overpowering for daytime wear as well. Not sure if this will be everyones cup of tea though but it does definitely stand out in my opinion."

And it smelled all right enough in the store. Employee said it was their best seller. Bottle was super odd and neat and cute. But I cant really describe the smell. Its not fruity or floral at all. Theres some kind of almost sensual deep musky smell with it, and be careful with the sprays, cause she lasts and lasts and lastsu2026 especially on clothes. My kid loves perfume. She wanted one spray of it last night while playing pretend. I barely even gave her not even half a spritz, and sprayed it to the side of her neck with her shirt collar pulled down, so that what I sprayed, all of the half a spritz wouldnt even hit her neck, and most of it would go just into the air kinda near her (cause I worry about spraying perfume really on any of the kids and usually try to use all natural products with them, with the least amount of chemicals possible). She already had her pajamas on before bed, and today is just a couple days before Xmas, so shes kinda prowled around the house in her PJs today, since we werent going anywhere today. Sthought she was sooo big when she got that barely even a half a spritz put on, lol. Well, her shirt collar somehow rubbing against that area at some point in the night has made her shirt smell like it from a mile away, and I can still smell it all over her. I smells I mean, pretty good to be. But its like a strong sense of this sexy, deep, dark, sensual smelling stuff. Not sweet or fruity or floral AT ALL. Not even a little. Til I can find a new signature scent (mine WAS formerly YSL Black Opium Floral Shock. Hate the regular Black Opium, but Floral Shock was sooo so so good for the type of scent profile I like. Except it was stolen from me a few months back). So thank God I had this bottle as a backup, while Ive been on the prowl for something else, or Id have had no perfume."

It smells very classy, perfect for a night out or just for going to work. Id say its definitely a u201cprofessionalu201d perfume, and smells very mature. I think spraying this on a sample card at the store may not give you a good idea of what this REALLY smells like. Once I gave it time to settle, I found myself liking it a lot. The only complaint I have is the price, but of course, quality perfume is often expensive."

It is the ideal scent for my vast taste. Its warm but light and makes you feel very sexy. Its not a super strong scent either its perfect for everyday as well as a special occasion. A must have!

It starts off with this beautiful freshness then as it drys down it has sweetness some musk and a little spicy kinda scent. When going in store they can only spray it on paper so not being able to actually spray it on my wrist is where this perfume kinda disappoints. I read reviews on this perfume where other people was saying it doesn't last. I figured we all have different skin types different chemistry. I figured I'd still buy it. This lasted 2 hours on my skin after that it was like I was never even wearing this perfume. It leaves no scent behind at all for $100.00 dollars I expected this to last a long time. Now it does last forever on clothes which is great that is last somewhere. But to me they need to go back and figure out how they can make this last longer. This was my first perfume I bought. I usually buy body sprays because spending a $100.00 on perfume you expect it to last. I even sprayed this on my neck and wrist like 4 times to see maybe its just a light perfume and adding more will do something and it didn't. I got b&bw body sprays that last all day on my skin and clothes so why can't this last longer. I probably won't buy this again when I run out even tho. the scent is amazing and intoxicating. I can't justify paying that much again for something not to last at least 8 hours or more. I hope they hear their customers and try and find a way to make this last."

I will say that I hate the packaging and I think the heel part of the shoe feels flimsy and cheap for the price. (I bought the 1.7oz bottle)"

The scent is hard to describe but to me it's very sexy and kind of mysterious. Wait for it to dry down before you form an opinion, I think the opening is quite 'meh' but when it dries it's spectacular. It lasts all day on me and a little bit goes a long way.

I bought a full size. True the top notes are not my thing but when it goes through it's magical changes it is worth it. I find I keep smelling my wrist through day. Give it a chance if you find opening is not appealing. It really does change. Everyone's chemistry is different I realize, I just know for me, I had to really let it mix with me. The longevity is probably the best of any perfume I own. It doesn't bother my allergies at all and so glad I didn't write it off. I am very picky, I won't buy something I don't totally want to wear. It's a keeper and I feel beautiful when I wear it. I don't have many perfumes I love, this is one I do."

This is a floral scent, the jasmine comes through predominantly, but is tempered nicely with a smidgen of vanilla. Florals are not usually my thing, however I find that the warm notes give the floral notes a complexity and depth."

My boyfriend loves this scent. It's his favorite out of my entire perfume collection. In essence, I'd describe the scent as warm. I wear it as a work, day-scent even though the packaging reads a little sexy.   My only suggestion for improvement is changing the bottle. The stiletto form comes across as cheap, and branding is everything. 4/5 stars, docking a star for the bottle."

Ive come to appreciate it now for its uniqueness, and I cant help but feel luxurious when holding it. I love the scent because its not super florally, despite having tuberose and jasmine. The coffee and almonds even it out to a warm and sweet floral scent, somewhat in gourmand territory. If you like Alien by Mugler, youll probably like this. I personally dont notice the scent that much, but apparently others around me do. My best friend and mother tell me all the time that they can smell it and that it smells like me as a perfume. Which is kinda strange to hear, but I understand what theyre getting at. The scent lasts a few hours before I cant smell it on my wrists, however Id say thats pretty good compared to past perfumes Ive had, which only lasted an hour. Overall, it works really well for me."

It's a nice perfume but too floral for me- the floral in it is a bit sickly like a bouquet that's a week old and needs to be tossed. I also am not a fan of the rollerball and wish it was an atomizer. The rollerball is good but leaves so much liquid on my wrist I'm left blowing it to dry or dabbing it all over my other arm to get it to dry down.  If you're into perfumes, you'll find this to smell very similar to most of the Valentino perfumes. Extremely floral, feminine and expensive smelling. It's very grown up and I wouldn't put this on a woman under 40 (I'm a 31yo woman who loves gourmands and some floral perfumes). It's an inoffensive fragrance and very office appropriate- some may find it too mature. Sorry! I know that Good Girl has a ton of fans but it's pretty mediocre and a bit too mature in my book.   For reference, the scents I buy over and over include: Hugo Boss For Her, Tom Ford Noir Pour Femme, YSL Black Opium,  Marc Jacobs Decadence,  YSL Mon Paris,  Clean Neroli,  Atelier Cologne Mandarin,  Lancome La Vie Est Belle,  Lalique Amethyst,  Elizabeth and James Bourbon. I avoid most Dior and Gucci perfumes!"

I loveeee this scent. the last few months I have found myself gravitating towards warmer, sweet scents like cinnamon and vanilla or caramel notes. and I usually love more sweet floral scents. my favorite of all time for winter are Michael Kors Wanderlust and Giorgio Armani Si. just for some background..anyway, I love this scent. the first thing I smell is the tonka bean, which gives me that cinnamon almost warmth that I've been loving lately. I was looking for a scent a few days ago at a fragrance counter and I told the lady I want to find similar scents to Good Girl, like with warm cinnamon notes and she looks at me like I had 5 heads..cinnamon?? that's unheard of in perfume.she said..but it's really not..I mean our noses are all different and when tonka bean notes and vanilla notes are mixed with certain other ingredients, they can give off almost a cinnamon scent. DONT DOUBT YOUR NOSES LADIES..lol.   Ugh I love this scent, it's not for the young girls..I'm 27 and I wouldn't have liked this perfume in high school..I was wearing Juicy in school..so it just depends how you want to smell..I like to think of Good Girl as a hug in a bottle..  I just wish it lasted longer. I find it doesn't last very long on me..and luckily scents tend to last days on me if I'm not careful or if I spray clothing or a jacket, it lingers for days. but not Good girl..its so sad. For the price it should really stay put!"

It was the only one that smelled unique. Sexy. Confident. Spicy. Flowery. Sweet. Its literally the best of every scent category! And to top it off the night of our anniversary I recieved more complaments than Ive ever gotten in my life with a fragrance! The shoe is just a beautiful plus!

So I have only a few go-to perfumes that u2018work on me: Creme dNude by MAC; u2018Saint by Kat Von D, and u2018Pure Grace by Philosophy (whose newer formulation lasts only about 45 minutes.) So when I got a sample of GOOD GIRL in a recent Sephora purchase, I was skeptical. Im known for giving away great samples and minis because they just dont cooperate with my ginger-girl skin. I sprayed two tiny pumps of GOOD GIRL and it was love at first sniff. This is a very sexy, sophisticated scent that really turns heads. Two men, complete strangers, asked me at different times what kind of perfume I wear, because they wanted to buy it for their wives! It really smells that good. GOOD GIRL will stay in my small, carefully selected handful of amazing perfumes. Its a bit of a spicy floral, but settles into a beautiful base note thats like a touch of magnolia. It also reminds me of Chanel No. 19, a classic thats hard to find anymore. GOOD GIRL is almost indescribableu2014long-lasting, delicious, a true *grown up* perfume thats perfect for date night, to spray on your sheets before bed, or for the office, where co-workers WILL ask you, u201cWhat is that scent youre wearing? I want it/want to give it to my girlfriend.u201d Yet its not too strong or overpowering. Its lovely, noticeable, memorable. To be honest, GOOD GIRL has released my inner bombshell! Expensive, worth every penny. The larger sizes come in a bottle shaped as a 6-inch stiletto pump. I really dont care for this packaging, so I think Ill transfer GOOD GIRL to a glass perfume bottle with a stopper."

You already know you're getting a unique play of contradictions here.  It doesn't disappoint. Good Girl (2016), an additive Oriental, has tuberose, roasted tonka bean, Sambac jasmine, cocoa, almond and coffee. For a split second, I thought there was amber in it (amber turns sour on my skin): Nope. The warmth is amber-free, and I get to enjoy the sexiness without consequences. I feel so bold wearing it. It's sweet, with a subtle spice to it. It's in between light and heavy (Carolina Herrera hit the right level for this) so this may be more appropriate for a date night out.    Received this as a free sample with my online order. I'm thinking about getting the 1.0 oz spray because I love the scent and the bottle will look so cute on my vanity."

As it wasn't stocked at Sephora at the time, I had to snatch this baby up right then and there.  The perfume is delectable and lasts all day.  It is a unique fragrance with multiple layers and notes of floral decadence.  The scent changes from the moment it is sprayed onto the skin and as you wear it throughout the day.  It becomes more subtle and feminine, but not diminished in intensity.  The bottle is stunning in itself and worth purchasing even if you do not like the perfume all too much.  The glass is thick and heavy and the whole piece looks like a sculpture that deserves a pedestal of its own on your vanity or dresser.  I even purchased the glitter bottle version.  This is an amazing item... purchase before it's gone!"

From the way individual notes are easily identified yet extremely well blended to the long lasting power and last but definitely not least its sex appeal. My husband is incredibly picky with fragrances, first time I wore this he spent the day with his face buried in my chest and other places. ;) Strangers have stopped to compliment me and demand to know what Im wearing. I thought Armani Code would be the one but I was too hasty with that review, it lasted all of two hours then faded to nothing. I'll chalk that up to fate bc Good Girl blows it out of the water! Eight hours later I'm still catching the scent when I move. I actually purchased a 17 piece sample set from Sephora in JC Penney (includes a voucher to redeem for a full bottle of your choice) there are some top notch designer scents included, thankfully this was one of them and is still #1 for me.  As a note of reference I do not care for cloyingly sweet scents or overwhelmingly floral perfumes nor do they work well with my chemistry. For example Prada Candy and Viva La Juicy were both included with the sample set and I despised them equally. But this concoction of jasmine, almond and tonka is heavenly. Good luck!"

It's not a fragrance that would be considered too old smelling or too young smelling for anyone, it is extremely versatile. I do prefer this fragrance as a night out fragrance, but would not hesitate to wear it during the day either. Once on the body, the fragrance changes slightly to become a warm sensual scent (which differs from it's scent on paper). The bottle is beyond gorgeous. I'm wearing it currently, so I can't say the exact staying power yet, but I have a feeling it will last awhile. This is one of my favorite perfumes that has come out in a long time. It is in my area Sephora stores at the moment, so I am currently using the free sample, and encourage others to go try it out."

The scent lasts about 20 minutes on me- not before it fades but before it's completely gone! And that beautifully designed bottle is a total joke. The cap doesn't click shut and pops off so easily that after I apply it and put the cap back on it always falls on its side when I set it down. The golden heels is very cheap lightweight plastic, which I was not expecting! It's so light that there isn't really enough weight to balance the shoe. Just terrible. Carolina Herrera I am appalled you actually put your name on this."

I get mostly tuberose and tonka bean from this. If I were to wear it regularly, it would be reserved for evenings although I do not consider Good Girl a sensual fragrance. While it is a bit pricier, it does last quite awhile on the skin."
