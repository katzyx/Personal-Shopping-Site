It's not the most blurring powder I've tried, but it gives an imperceptible look that I really like, meaning it will set and matify, without giving you that obvious powdery makeup look.  The one draw back that really frustrates me is the packaging. The fact that there is no system to close the sifter so that whenever I close the lid the powder does not come out, makes this really messy.  I keep my makeup in a makeup bag, so my powder does not stay upright. So whenever I open up the powder, there is already a whole bunch that has come out, and it flies everywhere when I try to get some on my brush or on the cap.At this price point (and this goes for many other loose powders) , I should be able to have a lock system to keep the powder inside the container and only shake out as much as I need. On the picture, I had taken out the powder from my bag and opened directly, without shaking it or moving it harshly, and that's how much powder was already out. Even for travelling purposes, this would be really inconvenient."

I needed a setting powder that would not just set my makeup and help control my oils, but would also be lightweight and not dry me out. This powder by Mario absolutely has worked for me and checks what I was looking for. The Neutral Peach color is a true neutral shade that offers light pigment but is translucent enough that it does not alter the color of my foundation or leave a white cast. For being Talc-free, this powder does a great job at setting my makeup. I find I do not have to touch up later in the day and even if my oils peak through, my foundation stays in tact. I love the natural finish; it has body but feels lightweight, and does not feel dusty, crusty, or cakey. I also appreciate that the sift cap is easy to remove. So when traveling, if powder collects in the sifter, I can remove it and carefully dump it back into the jar without it getting messy. I will continue to repurchase as long as this stays in the line. I hope Mario never pulls a Givenchy."

The packaging is marios traditional  basic but chic not heavy a good size and easy to carry i would say what i love the most about this is it works wonders for creating the pore blurr effect and for doing the no make up looks !

My undereye still does crease a little bit, but that isn't something that bothers me since that area is prone to creasing anyways. The powder doesn't irritate my eyes either.  They really need to sort out the packaging, because the powder plumes everywhere due to how finely milled it is. And it is an asthmatic's nightmare. I keep it upright on my nightstand to help it settle a bit, but they really need to sort it out by adding a mesh or something to keep the powder contained. This powder definitely isn't travel friendly. I am trying to find a solution to decanting it into something that won't get the powder everywhere."

On top of it hitting pan so quickly, i didnt like how it dried my skin like the Sahara desert and left a dusty powdered look to my skin. So after trial and error thru multiple powders i found this one. I LOVE IT!! Its blurs so beautifully, doesnt dry me out and leave a beautiful finish for almost my entire work day without having to repowder. I also have overly sensitive skin and no issues at all with this. I use it daily for a month now and still on the same purchase, havent run out yet. LOVE THIS!!"

The powder is very very fine and my only complaint is thst tends to get everywhere when I tap out the powder. If they can fix that that design flaw with the container it would be perfect!

Makeup by Mario's Surrealskin Soft Blur Setting Powder came at the most perfect time. I had been searching for a setting powder that was easy to go on, one that left me looking matte but not powdery or cakey, and one that was a great shade match for me; and I found that and more with this product. I received shade number 5 - Neutral Medium Deep and the texture seems to be velvety and smooth, making  buildable in case I was darker or lighter, which makes it easy to match and work with. I especially love that it doesn't leave me ashy, just as many other setting powders do. It leaves my skin feeling light, as if I don't have makeup on. With this powder, I go all day without getting shiny or greasy. For the oily girls and guys, this powder will change your life. For the dry girls and guys, this won't leave you feeling tight. I've used this powder multiple days and with multiple variations of makeup bases and looks, and this powder doesn't change. You get exactly what you pay for. There is no scent, so if you're sensitive, this is a great resource for you. Also, the packaging is simple, uncomplicated, and works great to help you keep from easily losing product, especially if you drop it. I plan to use every drop of this product, buy again when out, and would recommend it to everyone."

Out of all the powders I looked at that said best for oily combo skin. Thereu2019s only a few for us with dry skin. I didnu2019t have any hopes because this powder was not on my list and every time I asked, she said I canu2019t go wrong with any of them, but because of dry skin, she wanted me to try this and Iu2019m so happy I got it. I donu2019t think I wouldu2019ve bought it any other way loose powder powder in general. Itu2019s like it sucks all of my prep work and takes all my hydration out. Iu2019ve never seen a powder loose powder leave your skin like this, it blew me away because I have dry skin. They were putting this out that day if I went a day sooner itu2019s a powder I never wouldu2019ve bought and Iu2019m so glad I did all the powders that said natural finish radiant finish that didnu2019t say good for oily compost skin, I made sure not to put those on my list and as a woman and 35 trying to find make up that works for her they didnu2019t have my foundation shade that I came in for so I got a sample bought. This doesnu2019t even look I put powder onand my make up stayed. I never got more compliments on my skin with a certain foundation in this powder then I have since I was 28 this is for anyone with dry skin."

If you're olive you know how hard it is to find makeup that doesnt pull orange/peach on our yellow/green skin.

It's a very soft blurring meaning no too heavy on the skin. Now granted for I did get the wrong cookie but because I'm so tan it actually worked for me which does kind of concern me for the darker girls and guys but honestly it could just be more brightening for them which is how I normally like my setting powder. I would love to try it in a peach color.  Also be very careful when opening because the top came off and spoiled everywhere, hint the powder all over my shirt.  All in all though I think this is so a hit for Mario's first setting powder and can't wait to see what else comes out. P.S. I am a very oily girl so my oil did peak through at the end in the sunlight so don't expect for none at all.

It is talc-free and non-comedogenic which is another huge plus for me! I felt like there was a little shine throughout the day, but the light diffusing powder may factor into that. I have combination skin and I would have liked for this to have stronger oil control. It definitely doesnu2019t make my skin look dry or dull. It is buildable, but I noticed it creasing some. The price point is very reasonable and usually a little goes a long way with loose powder, so it should last a while before running out.  I personally donu2019t think this would be as long lasting for oily/very oily skin types. I donu2019t know if I will buy this myself, but I will continue to use it and see how it does with my skin.

It's a very soft blurring meaning no too heavy on the skin. Now granted for I did get the wrong cookie but because I'm so tan it actually worked for me which does kind of concern me for the darker girls and guys but honestly it could just be more brightening for them which is how I normally like my setting powder. I would love to try it in a peach color.  Also be very careful when opening because the top came off and spoiled everywhere, hint the powder all over my shirt.  All in all though I think this is so a hit for Mario's first setting powder and can't wait to see what else comes out. P.S. I am a very oily girl so my oil did peak through at the end in the sunlight so don't expect for none at all. Also just realized there is 2 darker shades so every color should be able to find a match."
