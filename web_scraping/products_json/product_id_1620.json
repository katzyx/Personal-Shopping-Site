It's expensive for an eyeshadow - no disputing that - but if you are looking to splurge on a shimmer shade you can wear every day, you will NOT be disappointed. I disagree that there are cheaper options with a similar effect - I have tried so many similar products of varying price ranges to find the perfect one and this is by far the best I have found.   I see some people complaining about the formula being dry and powder - that is not my experience with the shade I purchased. I use my finger to apply it over two matte shades from the Huda Beauty Creamy Obsessions palette underneath and have very minimal fallout and it lasts all day.   As for the size, I think it is comparable to ColourPop super shock shadows and urban decay moondust, but again, I think it is far, far better than both of those options.   It's a $30.00 eyeshadow, no one NEEDS it, but if you want it and can afford it I really don't think you'll be disappointed."

I think that it has to do with how you apply it, I use a glitter primer whenever I want it to last and stand out on my eyes always so again, I absolutely love mine and have had zero issues with it.
