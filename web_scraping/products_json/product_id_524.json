            "review_text": "This thing has the potential to grow mold. The current price of it at $400+ is ridiculous. I remember when I thought this product was expensive at $180.   It should come with a life time warranty at this price.  Another example of corporate greed and price gouging.   You can probably use a silicon pad - cheaply found on amazon and save your money.   Also this thing grows mold...even though it is supposed to be anti-microbial."
