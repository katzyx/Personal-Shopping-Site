If you have really dark circles you can use the matte stick for more coverage and layer the illuminating concealer on top for brightening the area and preventing dryness. These both work well for blemishes and you can pick based on your skin type. The fluid concealer may be better for dry skin and the matte stick for combo to oily skin.

Whether you like cream contouring with the matte side or a natural luminous effect with the liquid side this is an amazing product.   I prefer using the matte side in dryer climates because the cream sits on my face without running or bleeding creating that mud mask effect.   I like using the liquid for a natural bronze base. This is great for winter because it hydrates the skin and brings out a natural glow which gets lost in winter dullness. Liquid contouring can be tricky but if your makeup skills are advanced this product is amazing.   I would like to try another colour in a lighter shade so that I can use both for a full contour- highlighting and sculpting.   This is an amazing product for on the go spot treatment, especially if you are running out the door and are wearing minimal makeup or want to dress up your face without over doing it. It is also perfect for people that travel often due to compact packaging.   There is an ample amount of product in both ends of the concealer- liquid and cream- which makes it an excellent investment and worth taking along.  I LOVE this product and will definitely keep it stocked in my collection."

It doesn't settle into line or slide off throughout the day. The liquid is a nice fuller coverage highlighter, although it find myself wishing that it was toned just a half shade lighter to properly highlight. It does lend a nice subtle glow. I find myself still pulling out my Touche u00c9clat, however. Would buy again."

I went into Sephora looking for a concealer for contour and stumbled upon this gem. Not only is it perfect for contour, it covers everything! I put it on and it covers my red face. I put the matte side on my cheekbones, under my eyes, nose, chin, and forehead. Then I sprinkle on the other side in little dots. It makes you glow in a subtle, beautiful way. You don't even need foundation tbh. It even our skin tone, lasts all day, and isn't cakey. I also have tan very red skin, and it covers it flawlessly. This is the only concealer that has ever covered my red. This will blow up once people find out about it because it's amazing!"

I've actually been using it all over my face to even out my skin tone because I don't normally like to go heavy on the makeup everyday (and I'll be honest, I ran out of foundation months ago). I use the matte side and make dots around my face then I dampen my beauty blender with a hydrating spray. After I blend that out, I use the illuminating concealer under my eyes, down the bridge of my nose, on my forehead, and on my Cupid's bow. I also fill my brows out a bit with their eyebrow pencil. A little bit of blush, highlighter, and mascara and I'm out the door!  Pros: Hydrating upon application. Makes my skin glow. The matte side is the perfect domed shape.  Cons: There isn't a lot of product on the liquid side. After a few hours, I've noticed I start to crease under my eyes. It also sinks into fine lines (and I'm 22!)"

I'd love this is a larger size. It's beautiful. I use the twist side for blemishes or anything needing heavier coverage. The liquid is amazing for dark circles. I see no orange in the fair at all. But everyone's body acidity reacts to products differently. This is a great multitasking portable product. Try it, you will love it."

I have to say the product is easy to use and creamy. I have mature skin so some fine lines and wrinkles, I also have under eye bags.  This wore for about 6 hours before I noticed some cracking. By the end of the day my undereye area was a bit dry. Always moisturize day and night to prevent this. This product just didn't perform to my standard. I gave it 3 stars as the concept and portability are great, the longevity and cracking issue need some work."
