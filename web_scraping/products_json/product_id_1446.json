Sure; if you are looking at it percentage-wise, each sheet of this cotton (in the 165 sheet pack) is 62.5% more than each cotton round in the cheap pack I was buying from the drugstore. And I wasn't even buying the cheapest option from the drugstore.  But if you just look at the amount, $13 is not a lot for at least 165 uses, front and back. Also, the cheap cotton rounds I get sometimes tear in half as I am either taking them out of the packaging or trying to saturate one with product. These are super thick and soft, and luxurious feeling. The $13 lasts me a pretty long time too, because I don't really use a ton of these.  So in my opinion, the value of these over the drugstore cotton rounds is worth it. They even look nicer in my little cotton storage box than the rounds XD. They're more durable, feel better on the face, and are super thick. In fact, when I look up the sephora organic cotton pads right now, they are $4.50 per 50 pads (9 cents each). These are $13 for 165 sheets (about 8 cents per).   At any rate, these fit into my budget for the value and I really enjoy them and will buy again when I'm out :)."

Never before had I imagined that normal drugstore cotton pads were not adequate for this purpose until I purchased myself a pack of these. Now I use only these to remove mascara, eyeshadow and eye SPF, and have absolutely zero redness or irritation which I used to experience quite often with normal cotton pads. I don't use these for the rest of my face as they soak up a lot of the micellar water I use and I can find myself going through a bottle much faster. For other areas I just stick to regular drugstore cotton rounds. The other use I have for these is when I have a troublesome patch - rough/dehydrated area or acne mark. I simply cut the pad down to size required to cover the area, soak it with the right watery serum for the purpose and place it over the area. The pad adheres well so long as I'm not moving about and by the time I've removed it 10 minutes later I've had an intensive spot treatment that no amount of layering products would have achieved!  ~ My Sephora Top 7 must-have list ~  (My top 7 must-have beauty products of all time, focusing mainly on my purchases at Sephora)  1.

Itu2019s definitely more expensive but if you have the skin I have itu2019s a must. Muji pads come in second place. On my 3rd pack and will stick with these for as long as they continue to make them"

I personally use them to remove makeup, and in combination with my favorite makeup remover (clinique take the day off makeup remover, the one in the bottle) they are beyond amazing. With other cotton pads/rounds, I use eight maybe 7, and the cotton pads cause enough irritation that the concept of a night time skincare routine is ruined because just getting to a second cleanse burns, even with the same makeup remover.  But with these? I use three for a full face of makeup, and two for my half-face or my, I only have time to put on concealer, mascara, brows, blush and the nearest lipstick in sight I just shake my makeup remover, tip five dots on a single pad and press it to my eye for three minutes, wipe down and up, cover every corner of the pad, flip, repeat, throw it away, eye two, repeat, and face.  If you don't have sensitive skin, they still can be a good buy, especially if you are eco-conscious, and even if you're not they are still really soft and feel luxurious on the face, but if you can get away with using four old fashioned cotton rounds, then don't buy them, they're really not that special and not worth the price. I only buy them because my face skin is a drama queen, so yessss, I have to love them lol"

They seem sturdy when you first grab one, but then any liquid is on it and no good!  I also do not understand why the sides aren't sealed shut?!

I especially love them to use with my P50 lotion (which everyone should own by the way, I promise) because with that particular product, you're supposed to kind of press it into your skin and I soak one of these with it and sort of lay it on my face. I feel as if I waste less product so really it ends up being way more cost effective than cheapie cotton pads when you consider wasting whatever toner you use it with. They are also excellent for nail polish removal... I use 1 pad instead of 3 or 4 to remove everything. I highly recommend!"
