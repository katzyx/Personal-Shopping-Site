The firmness and elasticity on my face has not improved at all -it didn't get worse either but it most certainly does not have a lifted appearance as advertised.

            "review_text": "This is my first time writing a Sephora review and Iu2019m an employee. Tried this product on a whim while it was on sale after eyeing it during my shifts. I turned 30 this year and I am slowly trying to get into anti aging products. Id been using elfu2019s retinol pretty heavily and thought it was making my skin look awful, until I realized retinol can dry your skin and I needed a better moisturizer. I immediately noticed a huge difference in my skin after using this product and my face seemed more toned, mature, contoured, glowy, sexy, whatever you want to call it. I used it daily and nightly and didnu2019t get any new breakouts and saw my acne marks fading. I was shocked at how even and bright my skin looked and I was on my way to not even needing foundation. Then came the dreaded day - I pressed the pump and nothing but air came out. That was also the day I realized that the huge bottle really only held a 1.7 ounce tube. Even with my discount, I feel $48 for a miracle cream that only lasted a month or so is kind of steep (for me). However, as soon as I stopped using it, my face started breaking out in a way that  it hadnu2019t for weeks. Idk if thatu2019s a coincidence or not, but I didnu2019t even break out during my cycle while using this cream. So while Iu2019d either love a cheaper price or a bigger bottle, I think about this cream every day since I ran out and will repurchase, but I will also find a cheaper but effective alternative to use every other day to make the cream last longer. If price per ounce isnu2019t an issue for you, then this is a five star, amazing product that you probably wonu2019t be able to do without. Pic is no filter, just hourglass concealer on my under eye and some bronzer. Horminal acne marks used to be pretty bad around my jawline and chin."

I have been so happy with the results!    Here's what I Loved:   - I experienced no redness or irritation. In fact, my redness cleared up. I do experience    redness from rosacea and for full transparency of this review I was going through a period of    irritation with more redness than usual (as seen in the photos). This went away and my skin    has far less redness than usual.   - The compliments! My skin has become noticeably more plump/glowy since starting this    cream. This is not going to be a humble statement, but I have normally have really good skin    with the exception of my rosacea (ie; minimal lines and minimal breakouts) and am often    complimented on it. The compliments have more than doubled since the effects of this    cream have kicked in.   - This cream has noticeably reduced the fine lines around my eyes.   -  My skin is very hydrated and has a great glow after using   - I love the way it feels on my skin u2013 smooth, hydrated, and glowy, without being greasy.   What I Didn't Notice or Didn't Love:    - I haven't noticed any improvement in sagging skin. I have only been using this product once     a day at night though, so Iu2019m curious to see after my second bottle.   - The cream causes my sunscreen to pill, so I have to wash my face in the morning before    applying it. This isn't something I've had with other night creams, I'm usually good to just    splash water on my face and proceed with my morning skincare.   Despite the couple of drawbacks, glow and fine line reduction has made this a staple. I'm excited to see how a second bottle does with the sagging benefit claimed.

I have had no adverse side effects from using this product - no additional oiliness and no breakouts. In fact, my breakouts have been less over the last few weeks. I applied the product to clean skin every morning and most nights. I've noticed smoother, more radiant skin over the last several weeks. The packing is functional and pleasing to the eye, should you want/need to leave it out on your counter or vanity. I LOVE the size of the bottle and the pump is easy to use.

I am just shy of 40 with normal to sensitive skin and still struggle with breakouts usually around my period. Living in the high desert I can't express how dry the air the is, so finding something that can hydrate my aging skin in an arid climate is tall order when everything seems to cause breakouts. Well, InnBeauty Extreme Cream checked all the boxes for me.   I used four (4) pumps morning and night for the last five weeks and my skin has never felt more hydrated and looked more luminous. It's suppose to firm your skin as well, and I'm not sure I've noticed that, but overall my skin really does look amazing with an even tone and glow from within.  When you pump this out you'll find it to be really thick, don't be scared if you're breakout prone. As you apply it to your face and neck it instantly thins out due to its reverse emulsion technology. After I worried about it being too thick, then I worried it wouldn't moisturize as well because of how it thinned out, feeling almost water-y. My concerns were quickly soothed as it sunk into my skin and felt great! I use to have to use so much light weight moisturizer followed by an oil at night only to wake up to bone dry skin. Not with Extreme Cream. I wake up just as hydrated as when I went to bed.   A few asides: The bottle itself is pretty heavy and feel luxe if that's a feature you like, I don't typically. I did NOT notice a smell of any kind on my first bottle, but did on my second. Some people were saying it smells like crayons or sunscreen a bit. I do get that now on my second purchase, but due to how well the product works I don't really mind.  All in all, I am a total convert to this product, and into my second bottle (Sephora was out of the refill). If you're struggling with your barrier, or need hydration this could be a great option. And for under $50!   Thank you Gloss Angeles Confidential for this opportunity!"

It might be too soon to say for certain, but after a month of consistent use, my cheeks seem a bit tighter and smile lines are not quite as apparent as a result.

It felt luscious and hydrating upon application, but not too thick-- which was a concern of mine being that I have combo skin that leans more oily this time of year. Initially it seemed great, just a bit thick for my AM routine as it left me looking a little greasy. But really liked using it in the PM, as I'd wake up feeling like my skin was nicely hydrated.   That said, about 1.5 weeks later I had to stop using the cream as I noticed I was consistently getting a new blemish/breakout every day. At first I thought it was just hormones and bad lunch, but eventually I pointed to the cream and after I stopped using it, my breakouts subsided. I've had a similar reaction to another barrier-repair marketed product, so it may be a reaction to a specific ingredient or just that it's too much congestion this time of year for my skin type. I'm cautiously interested in testing this product out again in my PM routine when the weather cools down, but ultimately this wasn't a fit for me.

What I love about it: - I have dry to combo skin and this is so moisturizing without being greasy. I can feel the difference the second it hits my skin. I took it on a two week vacation with me during the testing period and was able to use this as my sole moisturizer day and night. Also have had no issues with combining it with SPF or pilling under makeup. Those with oily skin may consider opting to only use it once per day since it is extremely moisturizing.   Areas for improvement: - My only complaint about this product is the packaging - while the glass packaging is beautiful and makes it feel luxurious, it is much too bulky and heavy for travel. I opted to remove the glass packaging for travel but the top dispenser still adds a bit of bulk. Would be great to rethink the packaging to make it more travel friendly.   I didn't take before and after pictures to observe a noticeable difference on the firming and lifting benefits but I will absolutely continue to use this product as my primary moisturizer and look forward to seeing additional benefits with continued use.

(My intention was to try it for a full 28, but I dropped the bottle on my bathroom floor, and the top entirely broke making it unfeasible for me to pack it for a two-week trip.)  The first thing you notice when you open the product is the smell. For me, it smelled like sunscreen. Itu2019s not a deal breaker, but as someone who uses sunscreen that does not have a strong smell, it did put me off a bit. I really love the packaging, but for the size of the bottle, you donu2019t get that much cream. Butttt, it is refillable, which is a really nice touch. The pump was a little finicky, however, and required me to push down a few times for cream to come out. That aside, the texture is lovely, and it goes on nicely. Unfortunately, however, I didnu2019t really notice a difference in my skin between me using this product and my prior moisturizer by Tower 28. I felt like it did make my skin look a bit oily/shiny throughout the day. I was a bit disappointed too because I really wanted to love this product, but early on in the testing period, my neck started developing a rash from this product. I then switched back to Tower 28u2019s moisturizer on my neck and Extreme Cream on my face, but as someone who has a basic skincare routine, I didnu2019t love having to use two different moisturizers to cover my neck and face, and I had to be careful not to get any of the Extreme Cream on my neck after putting on it and my sunscreen. The unfortunate thing is that I also really wanted to try the product because of tech lines on my neck, but I couldnu2019t use it in the end for that purpose!  All in all, I think it has the potential to be a great product for someone else, but it wasnu2019t a winner in my book, and while I may still use the broken bottle when I get home, I likely wonu2019t be refilling the bottle in the future.

I was excited to get my hands on this cream as I had heard excellent things in the skincare influencer community.  It did not disappoint.  The cream has a rich reverse emollient texture that leaves the skin hydrated and glowy.  For two out of the four weeks that I tested the cream I was living in an arid mountain climate that typically leaves my skin feeling dry and irritated.  Extreme Cream was the ideal antidote.  My skin drank up the cream and felt hydrated throughout my vacation.  Back at home, I found that I preferred the cream at night as my final skincare routine step.  In the morning, I typically jump from all of my serums straight to a moisturizing SPF during the summer.  I found when using the Extreme Cream between serums and SPF in the a.m., that my skin was too glossy and my makeup was more likely to slide off of my face.  If you have normal to oily skin, then I would recommend this as a night cream as opposed to both a day and night cream in the summer.  That being said, it was great for me day and night in the mountains and I bet I'd like it in winter mornings too.  It does leave skin glossy/glowy, which I personally love, but might not be an oily girl's favorite.  The consistency and finish remind me of Augustinus Bader's The Rich Cream or UBeauty's Super Hydrator.  At this price point, I'd pick Extreme Cream over either alternative every day of the week!  I did not notice any lifting with this cream, but I don't honestly think that any cream can lift the skin.  I did love the texture and tone of my skin using this and loved that I could layer it over tretinoin, AHAs, Vitamin C without any irritation.  I definitely think the cream is worth checking out!"

            "review_text": "Here are my thoughts after testing this product for a month:   For reference my skin type is combo, shiny in the t-zone and I have rosacea type 2 where I experience bumps on my cheeks. I have a few fine lines at 37 years old and I have noticed some volume loss and less defined jawline so I was excited by some of the claims the company makes about u201cliftingu201d.   First impression: I was a little put off by the scent. I avoid essential oils and fragranced skin care because of my rosacea. There is no added fragrance or essential oils in the ingredient list so I believe the scent comes from one of the ingredients. It did not end up aggravating my rosacea and the scent does not linger.   I was worried this cream would be too heavy and rich for my combo skin but I was pleasantly surprised by the texture. It absorbed beautifully and felt like a great balance between feeling lightweight but providing enough moisture and hydration. I have noticed more balanced hydration in my skin and less oily shine throughout the day.   It wears really great under makeup which is a huge win for me as I struggle to find something that pairs well with my rosacea RX and sunscreen.   Overall I really enjoyed testing this product and will definitely repurchase a refill. I did not experience noticeable u201cliftingu201d but did not expect to after only a month of use. I am anxious to continue to use to hopefully get those results in time.   One thing I think could use room for improvement is the packaging. It is aesthetically pleasing but the size is a bit deceiving. For travel I was able to unscrew the glass vessel that reveals the slimmer, inner tube but the cap was still chunky and took up space in my carry on toiletry bag. I like the idea of the refill but I think there could be adjustments in the design.   Thank you Gloss Angeles Confidential for this opportunity"

Earlier in the year, I had bad contact dermatitis, something I had never had before. Due to that, I switched all of my skin care to Vanicream and have been using it ever since, mostly because I needed to finish the jar, but I was also just content using it since there wasn't really another moisturizer I was in love with. My skin has been through a lot with the dermatitis, and then I found out I was pregnant! My skin became pretty dry and dehydrated as a result, and I went through the process of figuring out what to use. I'm also acne prone so it was new territory as someone with usually combo/oily skin. Enter Extreme Cream. It was the first moisturizer I introduced to my skin after Vanicream (Note: My OB did say it was okay since bio-retinol isn't true vitamin A), and my skin instantly loved it. The reverse emulsion feels amazing, and it makes my skin have the prettiest glow. At night I use 4 pumps for face and neck, and in the morning I use two since I layer it under sunscreen. My skin never broke out from this, and I wake up in the morning with plump, dewy skin!! There is a slight santal-like smell for me, but it doesn't bother me at all, and it doesn't linger. I do think the texture of this cream makes it more of a summer cream. On days that I was really dry I had to layer my Vanicream over it to feel really sealed in, but most nights, it's fine on it's own. Since I have dry skin, I will probably either switch to something else in the winter or just layer this since it feels so nice! Another thing I don't particularly like is how heavy the bottle is. The packaging is beautiful, but I traveled with the cream and found that I didn't like it too much since it was so large and heavy. Those are minor things though. I do see this as a future repurchase and highly rec to all!  Thank you Gloss Angeles Confidential for this opportunity!"

I have combo, oily skin that can become easily congested so I tend to stick to lighter formulations, especially in the warmer weather since I love where it gets hot and humid during the summer months. After testing this for a little over 4 weeks I was incredibly impressed on how hydrating this was without feeling like grease on my face. I would say that while I tested this morning and night per my instructions I would recommend for skin that tends to be oily to use only at night, and possibly night and morning during the colder months. I did notice when I woke up in the morning that my skin felt plump and moisturized without being sticky but some days it felt a little too heavy. It worked well with my other skincare in the morning and evening and meshed well with both makeup and sunscreen. I did notice a bit more congestion in my chin, but that could also be attributed to the warmer weather and I can't say it was from the moisturizer 100%. Overall, my skin looks a little more even in tone and smoother than when I started and this is the only step in my routine that changed. The smell for me wasn't unpleasant, but it does smell like its ingredients so if you don't care for fragranced skincare this might be a bonus for you. The packaging is beautiful, with a glass bottle that houses the refillable tube but it is very fragile so it is best to keep in a cabinet and not part of a travel regimen. I can confidently say this is something I can see myself purchasing a refill of, especially during the colder months.    Thank you Gloss Angeles Confidential for this opportunity!"

I do feel like it smoothed my skin and made my lines and wrinkles less prominent which I didn't have high expectations for so that was a pleasant surprise.

I liked the texture; it is medium-weight, not a heavy cream but thicker than a normal moisturizer lotion. The product scent was fairly neutral (smelled like raw ingredients) and I prefer fragrance-free for any potential irritation. Extreme cream spreads on easily and leaves a layer on your skin that you can feel, but yet is not tacky. I noticed that products layered on top of the cream applied more easily and less could be used. I took a photo at the beginning of testing and after 4 weeks and I can see that the lines around my mouth look plumper!  Thank you Gloss Angeles Confidential for this opportunity!"

The cream is luxe and rich yet it absorbs into my skin beautifully.  It plays well with my other skincare products and leaves my skin hydrated and glowing -- both immediately after use as well as the following morning.  The packaging is very substantial and I love that it is refillable (helping both my wallet and the environment). Extreme Cream is focused on anti-aging and while I don't know that I saw firming and lifting miracles happen after this past month's use, I definitely feel that, over time, this will be a great part of my skincare arsenal to target my areas of concern. I'm adding this to my Sephora Loves immediately and can't wait to try other products from the line."

This paired really well with my minimal night time routine. Double cleanse, Dr. Idris dark spot treatment, extreme cream as the final step. The texture is so creamy and luxjuriosuly easy to apply. I didnu2019t notice any scent or fragrance associated with it. Every morning my skin felt hydrated, so smooth and plump. When I pivoted to include AM use, this layered VERY well under my sunscreen which was a HUGE win! I cannot stress the importance of wearing sunscreen with this - it makes your skin very glowy and flawless! I kept the morning routine very simple as well to track my results better. This was the sole indicator for me that this product was working. Iu2019ve used retinol serums in the past but this one is in a league of its own. I could not get over how smooth and plump it made my face and neck. One thing that was a little difficult to manage was the packaging, initially I thought my bottle was empty since the pump wasnu2019t pulling out any product. After checking with others, it seemed like the inner pump could become dislodged so it was necessary to check if it was on properly. While this isnu2019t a total dealbreaker, it would be good for the brand to reconsider the packaging on this one. I like the fact that itu2019s refillable but the pump should maybe be a little better quality or should come with an info card on how to check itu2019s properly installed. Overall, I would 100% recommend this if youu2019re looking for an easy way to incorporate a retinol product with a lot of punch behind it. I will definitely be purchasing the refill option!

I was nervous that it would be irritating, but I actually had no issues with irritation on my forehead. The cream is definitely rich and creamy, so my crusty forehead felt plenty moisturized!  I loved using this cream best under makeup! It definitely gives a great glow and plays great under both spf and makeup. I had no issues with pilling.   Even though I enjoyed the product overall, I am giving it 3 stars for the following 2 reasons 1. I didnu2019t see any visible firmness. This is a big claim the products makes, and I donu2019t agree. I feel like the marketing focuses a lot of firming, but I didnu2019t see those results.  2. My face did sting when I used this product at night after a BHA serum. This is extremely confusing to me because it was soothing on my crusty forehead (that I didnu2019t use a BHA serum on). So this is just something to watch out for.   In summary, I wish the marketing wasnu2019t so heavily focused on firming. I find that a bit misleading. Overall, itu2019s a beautiful, glowy moisturizer under makeup, and I would purchase again!

I typically go for non-irritating barrier repair type of facial moisturizers due to my dry, rosacea skin. And I usually need to slather on two generous layers both morning and night, and sometimes an extra layer midday just to keep my skin from feeling dry and tight.   Not with the Extreme Cream! I have been using 2-3 pumps for my face, neck and chest morning and night (a pump is fairly small). It soaks in immediately, leaves a lovely glow that is not sticky or oily to the touch, and lasts all day/night. TBH, it's more expensive than my basic barrier creams, but I use a lot less and can skip a separate peptide serum, so I'm pretty sure I'm winning! This bottle has lasted me over a month, using it twice a day. I use it under sunscreen daily and have had no pilling or application issues.  As far as the lifting and firming claims, I did notice some improvement in my skin. The small wrinkles around my lips are almost completely gone, and I'm seeing a lot more smoothness on my neck and chest where there was more visible sun damage. YMMV u2013 for me, even if there was no firming and lifting results, I'd still keep using it just for the moisturizing benefits.   This product didn't have any scent whatsoever for me, and I like that it's refillable. At first I thought that the chunky glass bottle is too much, too heavy, but now I'm used to it and I like that I can buy a refill (already on order) and keep using the outer bottle and pump. The only packaging negative is that the cap cracked, but it would be too large for me to travel with anyway.   Thank you Gloss Angeles Confidential for this opportunity!"

I plan to repurchase and have it on hand to wear under makeup (I don't wear makeup every day), to use for long flights, and whenever I need a one-product-and-go situation.

This intense hydration has been a blessing, especially for my aging and acne-prone skin.  The only drawback I noticed was the texture of the cream.

I used EC in combination with my retinol, sunscreen, and little else, and I have the best skin I've had in a long time. EC is hydrating and moisturizing without feeling heavy (though it applies richly, if that makes sense?). I was skeptical, as I live in a place with HUMID summers, but I haven't felt greasy or occluded. It layers well under my mineral sunscreen - no pilling or heaviness. My breakouts have been as light as they've ever been. I don't deal with sagging right now, so I can't speak to tightening, but my face feels as bright and energized as ever, so I'm gonna stick with it.

After using this product consistently for 4 weeks (paired with a retinol 2-3 nights per week), I noticed a difference in the fine lines on my forehead, more so than with a retinol and u201caverage/regularu201d moisturizer alone. Other areas of improvement included the look of aging on my neck and chest, which both now appear more youthful. The product itself feels very thick right out of the pump, but once applied onto the skin, it glides on easily (I used 2-3 pumps every morning and evening). It also worked great under the Beauty of Joseon sunscreen and all of my other makeup products and did not separate or pill. I donu2019t think it was supposed to be scented, but it smelled mildly of crayons to me at first. I honestly donu2019t have many critiques for this product, but will say that with my combination skin, I sometimes felt on the dry side by the afternoon and wanted to reapply a thin layer or spot treat specific problem areas. I think this product is reasonably priced for all of the benefits it touts and will continue to purchase and use it to see if my results continue to improve.

            "review_text": "I tested out this product for a period of one month, and to be honest, did not expect much. I didn't expect a moisturizer to have much impact on my skin (as opposed to something with a more potent delivery system, like a serum), but I have been enjoying the Innbeauty Project Slushy serum moisturizer so I was optimistic.   My skin is combo/dry, and gets very easily irritated and flaky. My main concerns are texture, evenness of tone, and loss of firmness.   To determine that any change in my skin was from the cream, I was very careful to keep my routine basic while trying this out- just gentle cleanser, hydrating serum (Slushy in the morning, CosRX snail essence at night), Extreme Cream, and mineral SPF during the day.  This product is genuinely such a pleasure to use. I love the texture, which is rich without being heavy. Love that it has a pump, love that it's refillable. I also love that the main component is heavy enough to not topple over as the product empties and gets pushed towards the top, which can happen with airless pumps.   Immediately after using, I saw the glossy glow mentioned on the box. I also noticed that I wasn't having the skin barrier issues I was having before, literally zero flakiness. By the end of the month, I noticed a big improvement in the tone and texture of my skin. As of yet, the effects on sagging haven't been dramatic enough to have me convinced I'm not imagining it, but I feel like my jawline is looking less jowly.   While I received this product free in exchange for my honest review, I ended up loving it so much I purchased a refill before the testing period was over. I'm a big fan, highly recommend, and if you're reading this Innbeauty Project, please make a mini for travel!   Thank you Gloss Angeles Confidential for this opportunity!"

This looks SO good under makeup if you want a glowy/dewy finish. Worked great over my serums, under SPF and makeup. It is fragrance free but I did notice a slight scent (maybe sandalwood?) I didnt mind it honestly. It feels like a good high end moisturizer at a lower price point. I used it twice a day for about a month, and it was consistent on my skin the whole time. Only cons I guess are that I did not personally notice any lifting or firming, as the package describes. And I think the bottle is overly large /heavy for what you get. I would suggest just traveling with the refill.  Overall I am a fan of this brand, and I am likely to buy it again. I also love that it's vegan and cruelty free (a must have in 2024, IMO.)

Would have to decant for travel  - I understand theyu2019re going for u201cluxeu201d but the weight seems a bit overkill  - The pump is very nice: easy to control how much product you dispense   Efficacy - Does seem to have vitamin a-like activity: causes a little sensitivity/peeling around nose, chin. Had to back off using prescription tretinoin (had been using 0.05% daily and had to reduce to a couple times a week to avoid peeling around nose/chin) - Noticed some skin firming/tightening - Skin feels moisturized throughout the day.

The texture is so lovely and feels luxurious when applying, like to apply on dry skin better than damp, and it gives the loveliest glow. Plays well with sunscreen and makeup too. The downside is that it is just too active for my skin. I have very sensitive skin and am prone to dermatitis outbreaks and this was certainly a trigger. I tried the recommend night and day application for the first two days and immediately got the dreaded red bumps. Then I pulled back to every night with another moisturizer on top as I was waking up with dry tight skin. That was still too much. Once I started only using it as I would a retinol, a few times a week sandwiched between cream, my skin was happier. When it calmed down the I did notice that my skin looked great!  I was able to apply it to my hands and neck daily and noticed a huge change in skin texture, firmness and dark spots as well. Will probably keep in the routine and use sparingly because I do love the results and feel but guess my skin is just too reactive for consistent use.

Its so hard to travel with becuase it takes up soo much room in my bag, but I wouldn't decant this into a different container because it might impact the efficacy of the product.

I only use moisturizers/cru00e8mes that are unscented or have a mild scent, so I love that this product is unscented.

Despite the humidity, my skin was getting really dry from time in the sun, and this product was incredibly soothing and moisturizing.   My only main issue was that the smell wasn't my favorite - not terrible, but kind of a strange thing to have on my face everyday. Aside from that, I will definitely be buying refills of this product!  Thank you Gloss Angeles Confidential for this opportunity!"

I have sensitive, acne-prone, dehydrated/dry skin that is pretty finicky with most moisturizers, and this didn't cause irritation or acne. Big plus for me there when a lot of actives bother my skin! I'm a mom in my 30s, and I look more tired than I ever have before, and this really has made a difference in the past month to make my skin look glowier and feel more moisturized. I do use prescription tret, and that combo didn't bother my skin using day and night. I didn't notice a scent, and two pumps was plenty to cover my face and neck. However, it is a greasier formula that take a few minutes to dry down.  My first complaint: I do need an extra moisturizer on top to seal it in. I live in a desert climate, so one lighter moisturizer isn't enough. Second complaint: you really need this to soak in before applying anything else on top. It feels like a heavier moisturizer until it dries down, which takes longer than my other moisturizers. However, I've had no issues with SPF or makeup pilling with this underneath. Third: I hate this gigantic packaging! I feel like I can't travel with it because it's just so huge and clunky, and I worry about dropping it.   Even with those complaints, I'm going to rebuy. The fact that I saw results, and it didn't irritate my skin are just too big to overlook! I can work with those few issues to get happier skin.

I found the cream was too thick and I preferred my lightweight gel moisturizers.  However, as a night cream, I am in love. I feel it gives an incredible amount of hydration and leaves my skin looking plumped the next morning.  I also feel that it has helped with some fine lines, too.  Looking forward to using this year round and am certain that it was continue to be a staple night cream for me.  Thank you to Gloss Angeles Confidential for the opportunity!"

In PM I just it over retinol and my eye cream.  Rarely do I have to use a thicker moisturizer over it- only if I have been going hard on a peel or retinol once in a while.  I have been complimented on my complexion this month.  I think the price for quality of product is great.  Apparently, it is refillable, too.  I would definitely recommend this product.

            "review_text": "I received this as a free tester. Normally I do a ton of research on products before I purchase, but since this was free, I just said ok letu2019s go! It has ceramides AP, EOP and NP along with several peptides. The ceramides are pretty high on the list of ingredients which is awesome. Normally they get stuck at the bottom and thereu2019s probably very little in the product. I have no idea if the peptides or bio-retinol are sensitizing because I never experienced any irritation. I just tried Stratiau2019s morning moisturizer and Iu2019m pretty sure it made my neck break out, so I was wary of trying this one. However, it was easy to integrate into my routine. It felt moisturizing but not overly so, so I could still use my Instant Angel over top of it at night. I used it under 3 different sunscreens (Anessa, Beauty of Joseon and Skin1004) and they all perfectly layered over it without issue. The one thing I did notice is whatever serum I used before needed to dry down otherwise the moisturizer began to slip around on my face, like it has those tiny water beads that burst, but that wasnu2019t intended. Iu2019m attaching my before and after pics - I canu2019t really see much of a difference although I do think my skin looks more radiant. The before pic was from June and the after pic is a month later in July, so my face should be tanner and it does look lighter and brighter. I am 38, live in a humidish climate on the west coast (PNW) and my main concerns are mostly preventing wrinkles and keeping my face hydrated. I have normal to dry skin, never flaky dry. I also have congested skin, blackheads on my chin and nose. One thing to note is that the bottle is HUGE but the container of product is normal sized. Itu2019s meant to be refilled. Something to keep in mind if you travel a lot. Itu2019s heavy and glass and clunky. Honestly it is my least favorite aspect of the product. However, this was a really nice moisturizer!

I just put this on before I leave and don't feel as blah as I normally would.  There was no noticeable scent to me and it wore well under makeup and SPF, even in the TX heat.    When I started using the cream, I had some light peeling around my nose. Nothing crazy and not the dry peeling you get with RX Tretinoin. That went away after a few days. I didn't have any other issues for about 3 weeks. I went on vacation and I did experience some very small zit clusters on my forehead and one larger one on my left cheek. I DO NOT break out. This was frustrating and the only reason I gave the product 4 stars instead of 5.  Thank you Gloss Angeles Confidential for this opportunity!"

My skin feels noticeably brighter and superbly moisturized after incorporating this product into my daily skincare routine. The experience of using the cream was great. Its lightweight texture absorbed effortlessly into my skin without leaving any greasy residue, which made it perfect for both daytime and nighttime use. I particularly appreciated how well it wore under makeup and SPF, providing a smooth base without compromising their effectiveness. The subtle, pleasant scent added to the overall experience without being overpowering, contributing to a soothing sensation during application. I used the cream consistently for over four weeks, and during this time, I noticed a significant improvement in my skin's hydration levels and overall radiance. While I loved the product overall, there are a few aspects that could be improved upon. For instance, I found the packaging a bit bulky for travel, which may not be convenient for everyone. Additionally, while the cream worked exceptionally well for me, individuals with extremely sensitive skin might want to test a sample first due to the added fragrance.  Overall, I am genuinely impressed with the InnBeauty Project face cream and would highly recommend it to anyone looking to enhance their skincare routine with a product that delivers visible results. Its effective moisturizing properties and compatibility with makeup and sunscreen make it a versatile option for daily use.  Thank you to Gloss Angeles Confidential for this opportunity!"

After using this product AM &PM for a full month, I have to admit, it's pretty great (if I could give it 4.5 starts that would be more accurate)! This product definitely makes a lot of claims and while I can't really speak to how much it improved the contours of my face (hence -.5 stars) I can say that it left my skin incredibly moisturized with zero heaviness and overall seemed to make my skin smoother, more even toned, and yes more glowy. The texture of this is unique. It's not heavy at all but still lush when you first apply and then it almost just feels wet. So you may need to tinker a bit with giving it some time to set before moving on to sunscreen, makeup, etc. Once you sort that out it layers beautifully with whatever else you're using over it. You also may find you don't need as many other products with this. For ex. if you're using a separate peptide serum, this should do the trick. I also found this to work well with my retinal in the PM but also think it works great as a solo night cream. Perhaps most importantly I had zero issues with breakouts, clogged pores, or irritation of any kind with this product. For the cost, this is kind of huge steal! It feels and preforms just as well as products 2x the price. Plus I only need 2 pumps for my whole face and neck so cost per use for this is insane imo. If you are someone looking for a product to help with overall tone/texture/fine lines that isn't heavy or irritating this is a SOLID bet."

Iu2019ll start with the negatives since there arenu2019t many. The cream is a little too rich for me to use twice a day. When I first started using this product my skin was unusually dry and nothing I tried helped, but this cream definitely brought my skin back to life. However, my skin is usually oily and now that weu2019re deep in the Texas summer, twice a day was just too much for me. Going forward, I will only use this cream at night & reevaluate when winter comes. Since the formula is rich, it was a bit tricky figuring out how many pumps I needed. Depending on the condition of my skin, I need 1.5-2.5 pumps. And lastly, the bottle is heavy & glass. That is a positive in its own right, but since I travel a lot for work, it can be a hindrance. Now to the positives. WOW my skin has seriously never looked better, this cream is stunning. Compliments galore on my skin! In the morning, I wore only the cream topped with SPF. I tried multiple SPFs and all worked out well over the cream. It also wears beautifully under makeup. At night, I sometimes used alone and other times with my other products. I found that layering it with other products was a little too much for me since I am naturally very oily. This is great news for me cause it means itu2019s a perfect one stop shop for my skin. If you do not have the time or simply donu2019t want to spend the time with 5+ step routines, I think this moisturizer is a wonderful option. In general, I tend to use what my skin needs on a day by day basis, instead of a set routine (and I just love trying products) but I could see this being the only product I use, especially when Iu2019m traveling and donu2019t want to pack too much. I truly enjoyed this product and Iu2019m glad it lives up to the hype it receives. I already purchased a refill for myself and another bottle to gift my mom.

This has been so hydrating without being too heavy. I love the texture of the product and how well it blends into the skin, especially at night (no moisturizer on my silk pillowcase, just on my face). It also pairs nicely with all of my other skincare products (and I do a full routine morning and night), and it also looks lovely under makeup. I have worn this both day and night, but currently think that it is a bit too much for the extreme heat and humidity during the day, so I am currently just using it at night (and will use it during the day come fall).  If you have more oil in your skin, I would start with just a small amount.  I find I only need one pump to fully moisturize my face, which means this product is going to last a long time.  I did not expect to actually see any results beyond hydration, but I find that my skin is a bit more even in tone, is glowing and I also feel like my laugh lines have softened/blurred a bit.  I find that this followed up with tinted sunscreen is the perfect glow during the day, especially for those no-makeup days. I love that the product is refillable, but I do wish that it wasn't so large/heavy given that it is only 1.7 ounces.  I'd love a smaller package option for travel.

The one downside to the packaging is that it is difficult to tell how much product is left in the bottle.  I also love that there is no discernible scent. The cream itself is lightweight and smooth. I used this cream for weeks and put it to the test AM and PM and never once did I feel like the cream was too heavy or greasy. It layered nicely with spf, serums, makeup. My skin always drank it up. In fact, I feel like the addition of this cream under makeup helped to improve the visible texture of my skin. My skin looks so much more smooth with this in my rotation. I also noticed that after 4 weeks of using this cream, my skin really does feel more firm and tight. I used two pumps on my face, neck, and du00e9colletage and noticed results after the first week or so using it twice a day. I will definitely be refilling my Extreme Cream once I run out.

I found the cream to melt into my skin on application which felt luxurious. I had no issues using this product with any of my others (Vit C, SPF, tret) and found it was a great base for make up! The one thing I dislike about this product is the packaging - itu2019s large, heavy, and clunky, which makes it a liability near a tile floor and would prevent this product from ever traveling with me via plane. At 1.7oz it would be nice to already be in u201ctravel sizedu201d packaging. Otherwise for the price point this is a great moisturizer, one I am likely to repurchase!

I have pretty reactive skin so initial I loved it, especially since it has bio-retinol and ceramides but over time I experienced breakouts which resulted in me only using this on my next and chest.   I think is a great product for those who have normal and combo skin especially if you are looking for anti-aging benefits, so 30+  If you have oily, acne-prone or sensitive skin I would be be cautious"

Need to have light moisture in the day and heavier moisture in the evening.  Skin Concern: acne prone, pigmentation from acne, and fine lines (smile and du00e9colletage). With that being said, letu2019s go over my thoughts on this product! The texture feels light, but not light in a gel way. It a texture Iu2019ve never felt before. Itu2019s not a heavy feeling rich creme. But itu2019s not a light gel. Itu2019s something in between that I canu2019t quite describe. I found it to be the right moisture for me in the day time. But I felt my skin wanting more at night. This could be due to the fact I use a hydrating SPF during the day(which, btw it layered really well under my SPF and makeup). However, I use this because of the results. Keep in mind I use many type of actives, so I like to think my skin is resilient. I didnu2019t feel any irritation while using this, and my acne did not flare up. I mainly saw the best results in my du00e9colletage. I believe with continued use I will see my skin firm around my jaw line. Iu2019ve been using this product for roughly a month. If your skin sounds like mine, you may need additional products to fine the moisture your skin needs. But all in all, itu2019s a great product with great actives. I will continue to use!

I have extremely dry skin, despite the change in seasons, and this made my skin visibly glow like no other moisturizer I have ever used. It was very nourishing, not too thick or sticky  and unscented. It laid beautifully under makeup and gave me a more glowing from within look. Also of note it was the perfect ethereal dewy glow, not a sweaty wet post gym glow. It didnu2019t burn or tingle upon or after application, and I do feel like after a month of testing my skin is firmer. My only qualm with this moisturizer is that I believe it caused me to break out on my cheek. I rarely struggle with breakouts, and only ever on my jaw and chin, so that was definitely a downside. This moisturizer says it can be used with actives, retinol, and essentially your entire current skincare routine both morning and evening. I think using this morning and night along with my preexisting routine of acids and tretinoin might have just been a little too much for my skin. When I cut back to using it in just the morning I noticed I only had a small breakout once. Despite these breakouts I do think the overall texture of my skin improved, and the glow and hydration I had when I was wearing it was truly noticeable in the best way. I would definitely purchase the refill when I run out, as well as try other products from this brand. Thank you Gloss Angeles Confidential for this opportunity!"

It has no scent and has not irritated my sensitive skin at all. It has helped immensely with dry patches on the lower part of my face that looked terrible under makeup, and I feel that the overall texture of my skin has improved. I love the refillable system and will definitely be taking advantage, though I wish there was a lighter option for travel, as the outer glass bottle is heavy and bulky.

A few cons: I did feel a little bit of tingling/spiciness when I first started using it, but it eventually went away. Also, I did experience some peeling in the nose area.

Itu2019s incredibly nourishing without being too thick and this is where it gets complicated. My first week or so, I wore it morning and night and it left me absolutely hydrated and GLOWING. I was obsessed.   However, as time went on I noticed some congestion just underneath the surface which always means something is getting trapped. I didnu2019t immediately think it was the moisturizer, but eventually I tried using it only at night and noticed a difference.   My takeaway is this product is just a little too heavy on my combo skin in the summer months so Iu2019m bummed about that, but feel it would be amazing to bring back in the fall/winter.   All in all a mostly good product, but just be mindful of your skin type. If your skin prefers gel formulas for example, I would be aware it could be a touch too heavy.   I didnt experience any reactions and continued to use retinol products as well. Bottle is a nice weight, although not sure how much product you actually get. Would be curious to see the refills.

I used this morning and evening as directed for a month, and the immediate nourishing moisture this provides is undeniable. Over a few weeks, I noticed my jawline appeared more defined and cheeks seemed more lifted. Deeper lines appeared softened. The cream has an irresistible texture, one I have yet to experience in a product before, and this made me look forward to using it. At night, I apply it all over my face, neck and chest, then I spot-treat by adding a little more to my areas of concern: nasolabial folds, elevens, jawline, and outer-eye corners. I then try to wait about 20-30 minutes for it to soak in before my head hits the pillow. The packaging is quite beautiful; the bottle's size and heft (it's glass) do make it seem like there's more than 1.7 oz.

I love that it goes on smoothly and you can instantly feel an improvement in the firmness of your skin.

For context, my skin type is normal but leans towards dry. Iu2019m a longtime follower of the u201cGloss Angelesu201d podcast and cohost, Kirbie, put this brand and product on my radar. Her glowing reviews and specific comment of u201cAugustinus Bader dupeu201d at a fraction of the cost really drew me in and in turn, I kept this product in my orbit to try in the future. When I was selected to test this product, I was in pure shock and disbelief, but ultimately so grateful and excited for what was to come. Upon the first application, I instantly fell in love - specifically, the luxurious texture and the plump feeling it left my skin as it completely drank it up! I donu2019t consider myself particularly sensitive to scented products and I would agree that this falls in the u201cnon scentedu201d bucket as advertised. If you are someone who has scent sensitivities, I find it wears off within five minutes tops. Each morning and evening, I apply three pumps and disperse on my face, du00e9colletage, and the residual on my hands. As a major positive, I didnu2019t experience any pilling of sunscreen or makeup, but I do let the product absorb for ~10 minutes prior to applying anything additional. Within the first week of testing, I initially noticed slight firming and a reduction of noticeable pores. After the second week of testing, I noticed my hands were noticeably firm and were less dry. After the third week of testing, I noticed wrinkles on my forehead and around my eyes have magically reduced. As someone who has dabbled in preventative Botox, this is a pleasantly surprising alternative method! That being said, I will certainly continue to purchase the refills going forward as itu2019s honestly become a holy grail in my skincare line up.

I used this cream morning and night for one month to test it. My initial thoughts were that I loved the glow it gave me, but I didnu2019t love wearing the cream during the day. It worked great under sunscreen and makeup, there was no pilling or anything, it was just too much for my skin type for the summer months. At night, I loved it. The reverse emulsion is such a unique feeling. It comes out of the pump like a traditional thicker cream, but once you rub it between your hands or onto your skin, it u201cbreaksu201d and feels like micellar water. It feels like a sealant on my face honestly, which is great for nighttime for me. With lighter gel creams, I tend to wake up in the morning on the drier side, but I wake up feeling moisturized with this cream. As far as anti aging goes, I do believe the lines on my forehead have become less prominent. I couldnu2019t really get the cream onto my crows feet lines due to the product causing my eyes to sting and water if I got any into them. Overall opinion- this cream is effective, gives a really pretty glow to the skin, and is great for nighttime use for a combo skin girly. Iu2019m excited to try this cream further and see how it feels in the colder, drier months. Thank you Gloss Angeles Confidential for this opportunity!"

Since using this the texture and fine lines have diminished completely and I have a perfectly balanced complexion, especially when wearing makeup. This sits wonderfully under makeup too, even with a few other products and serums underneath. I really notice the reverse emulsion technology they talk about, it starts off feeling as a thicker cream but once you rub into your skin, it feels like literally butter melting, itu2019s really quite a beautiful experience.

This was a huge win because I didnu2019t want to change any other parts of my skincare regimen. And thereu2019s nothing worse than a moisturizer that makes your makeup pill or do weird stuff. In fact, I felt that using this cream worked almost like a primer for me. It made my makeup application smoother.

I found the texture to be pleasant, a little thicker than I am used to for daytime wear but it absorbes well into the skin without leaving an oil slick across my face. For PM use, it has worked well with my actives (retinol, azaleic acid). I did experience some sensitivity in my first week of use but it resolved itself when I backed off my actives for a few days and slowly added them back in.  Results: immediate glowy skin, a tightening sensation, temporary plumping. Did not experience any significant improvement with tone, my hyperpigmentation, or permanent results with fine lines.

Layers well with other products in my routine, including retinol, sunscreen, etc., and make up when I do wear make up. I'd say if you can afford it, buy it.

It doesn't feel too thick on the face but does feel very moisturizing. However, it's a bit thick for me under sunscreen in the summer when my skin is more oily and prefer it for night. I found the scent to be a little bit herbal but faded quickly.  I have been using this product for about a month and my skin definitely feels smooth, clear, and hydrated, but on occasion it can feel a little spicy around my naturally sensitive eyelids.

It immediately sinks in but still feels hydrating past the immediate application. I found the scent of this product pleasant, it's a light scent but goes away pretty quickly anyway.   When using this cream, my skin immediately looks visibly plumper. Happy to say that after just 4 weeks, I can see that the main wrinkle on my forehead looks significantly less prominent :) While I used this consistently AM/PM, I think I'll continue with mainly PM use. It paired nicely with my SPF and didn't seem to cause that much more oilyness during the day, but at least for the summertime I'll keep it to PM use. Will definitely re-up on this when I run out.  One comment about the packaging: I love the idea of a refillable product, but while the glass bottle feels very luxe it's pretty clunky compared to the actual component that holds the cream.

Despite it being so rich (it honestly feels like AB The Rich Cream, in a great way - thank you reverse emulsion!) it also had the strange effect of leaving my face a peeling mess about half the time (particularly in on my forehead and nasolabial folds). I stopped using my tret while on this for the month, but that didnu2019t really make any difference. I also got some increased congestion on my chin - sigh. Overall, I really like this cream but for me I could only tolerate it nightly and at times found myself layering a more simple moisturizer over it in the areas I was peeling.

It's heavy in texture but doesn't feel heavy on my skin, even in humidity. I can easily wear this day and night. It works well with my other products also. I don't notice any fragrance which I like, overall the product is great. The packaging is refillable, when you repurchase you get the refill size and insert it into the bottle. A downside (one star off)  is that the packaging is heavy and unfortunately mine rolled out of my travel bag and landed on the tile floor of my hotel bathroom and shattered, so I'd say it's a bit fragile. Also because it's opaque you can't tell how much product is left in the bottle.  I will definitley continue using this moisturizer but I may put it into a travel container for weight and so I can see how much I have left.  Thank you Gloss Angeles Confidential for this opportunity!"

As someone with extremely dry, sensitive skin, I was skeptical to try this moisturizer when I noticed the relatively lightweight, thin texture. But this one exceeded my expectations.  - Ultra-light texture  - Absorbs quickly without leaving a greasy residue - Provides solid hydration despite its lightweight feel - Works well under makeup - no pilling or caking - No adverse skin reactions  While I can't speak to long-term anti-aging effects yet, it seems promising.  If you're looking for a moisturizer that multitasks without causing irritation, I recommend giving this a try!"

I live in the Midwest where it is currently hot and humid with skin that is acne prone and tends to lean oily. If I used this during the day along with my usual serum and SPF, I found it to be too rich and caused some congestion. After about 2 weeks I decided to use it in the evenings only but the last week or so I've been feeling like my skin still feels too dry. I can physically feel the product on my face but areas of my face just felt tight, like it still wasn't moisturized enough, and I found myself reaching for other products to top things off with to give my face the cushy, hydrated feeling I was after. I'm just turning 38 and have visible signs of aging and do feel like I've seen improvements in my laugh lines and also the vertical lines on my chest, but I'm finding I'm not loving the way my skin feels with it. I do think in the winter when it's cold, snowy and dry that I would enjoy this as my day cream however and plan on giving it ago again once cooler weather roles around. I do love that it's refillable, and the price point is great for the ingredients. It does smell initially like crayons to me but I appreciate that it does not contain fragrance and any scent disappeared quickly. Thank you Gloss Angeles Confidental for this opportunity!"

Since I was testing this product, I tried to have a consistent routine, but it mixed well with all of the products I typically use, no pilling. I suspected the cream would be too heavy during the day in humid NC summer heat, but it never felt too heavy. I liked using during the day and night. If anything, i'd use one pump during the day if I was trying to anticipate hot weather. I love the reverse emulsion texture, it felt elegant and the finish was very nice - top tier! I didn't really discern any scent - and wasn't really conscious of any scent though some in our testing slack channel did. My skin does feel more firm but i honestly want to keep using longer to see i notice a more discernible change. I plan to get a refill once it runs out because i like it so much and I think the pricepoint is great for what it is and how it compares to luxury moisturizers that are marketing anti-aging in their claims. I also like how weighty the packaging feels and love the rose gold dispener. Not really any downsides other than maybe the bottle could be smaller considering it's like 1.7oz.

At first I thought the texture was something I would only want to use at night, but after seeing how glowy my skin looked in the mornings, I decided to give it a go for AM use too. It makes skin look nice and hydrated without feeling greasy. With my typical gel moisturizers, that glow would usually go away after about an hour, but I feel like this cream makes skin look glowy for hours on end.  As for lifting and firming, it's hard to say if I saw any difference in my skin, but I do think it has a bit more bounce to it.  My skin also did experience some slight peeling after about a week and a half, but I used a gentle exfoliator every 2-3 days to slough off dry skin and that helped. Once my skin got past that phase, I found that it really brought out the glow. And now I wonder how many more times can I say glow in this review, but it really did work its magic in this department!   The one drawback is that it's a fairly heavy bottle and not so travel-friendly, but I do love the idea of the refill option!  Thank you Gloss Angeles Confidential for this opportunity!"

I wasnu2019t sure if it was hormones or something else so I stopped using it. I started using it again after hearing about it on the podcast a second time and sure enough I got acne and really stubborn painful cystic acne spots. I remembered that I had this reaction from when I used this previously. I thought maybe my skin was adjusting so I used this for a few weeks and as I continued to use it the acne was worse and deeper. I use prescription tretinion so any acne is very rare and especially to this extent. It was so bad and painful and made me feel really self conscious. This product does not work for me and I didnu2019t notice any of the benefits that it claims to provide."

The pump is really nice quality and seems to dispense a very even amount each time and the product itself feels dreamy. Itu2019s a beautifully thick and rich cream, but isnu2019t heavy - so it applies wonderfully to the skin but absorbs just as well and doesnu2019t leave you feeling sticky or like you have a thick layer of product sitting on your face. My skin immediately felt softer and better hydrated, so itu2019s a great option for the dry winter weather weu2019ve been experiencing but I also donu2019t think it will be too much even when summer rolls around. My skin definitely feels plumped and super soft. And after a couple of weeks of use I feel like Iu2019m starting to notice some improvement in firmness around my jawline. So far Iu2019m incredibly pleased and I canu2019t wait to keep using it! If any of what I mentioned appeals to you, regardless of your age, I would definitely recommend giving this a try, itu2019s really lovely!"

It feels a bit more emollient (imagine mixing a drop of oil into moisturizer - except there's no need to add that additional step with this cream). This serves a dual purpose: softening dry skin and also adding a beautiful glow to the skin.  Now, as a person who works in research myself, I have to admit that I heavily side-eyed the claims on lifting. At the very least, I expected to see a consumer perception study (meaning: they asked people did this lift your skin? and they answered probably!) But I gotta give it to Innbeauty: it looks like they did indeed hire a third party lab to analyze real skin for the results. I admit I'm still a bit skeptical, but perhaps peptides do hold promise (or perhaps ceramides/bisabolol/etc firm skin via strengthening?)  In terms of what I have noticed, I will say that my dry skin LOVES this cream. I love how it instantly moisturizes and gives me a glow, I love how nicely it glides on my skin, and I love it under makeup. I'm also glad to see this is a refillable system, wherein there is a reasonable discount/incentive to repurchase. $40 to pick up another beautiful cream? Well thought out, Innbeauty!  My only additional commentary is that I think oily skin types might not love this - for all of the reasons that my dry skin type does."
