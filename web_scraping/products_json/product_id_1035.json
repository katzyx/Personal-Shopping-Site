            "review_text": "I never thought I could afford a Margiela perfume until this set came along, on sale it's a great deal you get 40mL all together. The box was kind of gross I picked it up from the store they were all dented, had makeup and dirt strains, but still cute presentation if you were gifting, although I wish it came with a cap like Margiela gift fragrances sometimes do. The travel spray is really nice for on the go and the tiny 30ml bottle is very cute, but both are not filled all the way. The scent is very yummy, it smells like vanilla extract and then cookie dough when you mix the wet and dry ingredients together, a bit of honey or syrupy, and very creamy like philosophy's fresh cream. It's not too sweet which I love as I usually find dessert fragrances overpowering, but this has moderate sillage but isn't too overpowering, to give you an idea my friend who was driving could smell it while I was sitting in the back of the minivan, but I don't think it has any more projection than that, which is good as I'm not one for a strong perfume, in fact I'm usually allergic. I kind of think of it as a clean girl gourmand which isn't sickly sweet or alchool-y but subdued and not as childish as smelling like fresh baked cookies seems. Kind of upset that it lasts maximum four hours on me, but it is an eau de toilette so that's expected. Very warm, cozy and subdued scent. This was a nice splurge that I probably won't be able to afford again which sucks because it makes me want to try more Margiela, although my bank account won't be too happy. it is also clear, not yellow, although I don't think that matters unless maybe they changed the formula? Great nonetheless!"
