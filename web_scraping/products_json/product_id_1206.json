By the way my hair is medium thickness but has many breakage and split ends due to hair extensions and not being able to cut all the bad off unless I wanted a short short haircut which I don't. Another main thing that I love about this product is that I put it on the next day for hydration and it doesn't leave residue or make my hair look like I hadn't washed it. It just looks healthy. This project really does hydrate. I'm so glad I purchased this item and I don't really leave reviews but I knew that I wanted other women to find something that actually works without spending hundreds of dollars.  The pictures I posted are from the second day without using the product. So I applied the product the day before and this is second day. My hair is not or was not this healthy LOL and I did not use any filters"

In the past few months I have been dealing with split ends in the back of my hair for some unknown reason so I was excited to try the Olaplex No. 5. I love the scent itu2019s very light and goes on smooth. I typically let my hair air dry rather than blow dry it to save time and not get more damage. After I used the Olaplex my curls were popping! The damaged parts even had more plumpness and wave to them. I would definitely recommend this product especially if you have some damage to your hair and want to have them revived. Itu2019s not just for curly hair but for all hair types, whether you trying to reverse damage or have your hair look its best amen and Moisture is for you!"

From there I work the product upward and then brush to help distribute it well. I think it really helps add the moisture to my hair that I desperately need while also helping to seal my split ends. I love that my hair feels smoother and looks nourished with this product. The only thing I don't like is that the smell is not the same as the old product or other products from this line. I feel like it is slightly different and almost sour. However, the product works perfectly even with the slight scent change."

Iu2019m excited to use this in conjunction with their shampoo & conditioner and no.3 product.

I tried this product in hopes of repairing my hair and creating a sleeker, smoother appearance. The first thing I noticed about this conditioner is the texture. It's thick and viscous, but still runs. It feels rich in the hand and smells wonderful, without being overpowering more of a clean scent. The first time I used this I used 2 pumps as directed on damp clean hair. I noticed immediately my hair looked smoother and shinier within hours. However, by the end of the day and into the next day, it felt a little weighed down. I have wavy hair and it gets pretty flat and straight. If a product is even slightly heavy It's a struggle to moisturized. Ue to this the second time I used it. I only used 1 pump, and that suited my hair much better. It still felt heavier than normal a couple of days after using it. But my hair also looked smoother and way shinier. Overall, I really like this, leaving treatment and how it made my hair. Look, I wish it was a tad lighter so I could go longer between hair washes. But with the right amount, it's not a deal breaker, and I will still continue using it.

Wow, I couldnu2019t believe the instant softnes, there was a shine that Iu2019ve not seen from my hair. It visibly looks healthier and has a lot more Vavoom type fullness that I never see unless I use a box full of different products. This leave in actually gives me a wash and go option that I rarely get to experience. After shampooing/conditioner I used 2 pumps while my hair was still damp. This formula distributed so evenly through my hair. The scent was also pretty incredible. Such an energetic scent, Iu2019m a huge fan of citrus and am truly grateful that it doesnu2019t have a super sweet scent.

I can tell you it did not disappoint! The No 5 leave in is a really release that I'm super excited to have in my lineup against hair damage, another great product that allows me to take risks with hair that weren't possible prior.. You get a really good amount of product in this bottle first of all and it really goes a long way, you don't need much.. I tell clients to apply a half pump at a time and you can always add more instead of wasting it.. It immediately makes the hair more manageable and reduces any tangles making it easy to comb through. It leaves the hair feeling immediately healthier, shinier and softer. And I love that it's also a heat protectant and seals down the outer cuticle leaving the Hair feeling smoother..

It has some sort of watery lotion texture and the scent is extremely odd but not disgusting. I split my hair into four sections, and then split each section two more times, then used a half pump on each split section. As I went on, I started using less and less because the residue built up on my hands (a good thing). Blow-drying my hair after was a breeze.

I have been loving the addition of this Olaplex No. 5 leave-in in my haircare routine and how quickly Iu2019ve seen results on my color damaged hair. I also tend to use a lot of heat styling tools regularly as well, so my hair definitely takes a beating and needs a repair based leave in to help restore, smooth and revitalize my dry, damaged locks. Formulated with Olaplexu2019s Bond Building Technologyu2122 and High-Adhesion Sealing Complex, this leave in conditioner helps to instantly hydrate and detangle the hair leaving it feeling soft and looking moisturized. This leave in also aids in repairing and smoothing split ends which makes a huge visible difference in the hair health with continued use. I absolutely love how well this works in my hair, it has a thick texture, but feels lightweight on the hair and makes combing out my tangly hair a breeze. Definitely perfect for anyone with split ends or damaged hair looking for a leave in that shows results quickly. This review was collected as part of a promotion."

I was excited to receive this product because my hair has noticeable split ends, especially after I straighten my curls.  I applied a single pump of the product to my towel-dried hair before blowing drying my hair with a volumizing brush attachment.   The product softened and smoothed my thin hair without leaving it feeling oily or weighed down. The product left my hair looking shinier and healthier with noticeably less frizz and sealed my split ends.  I have been unemployed since April 1st. My naturally curly hair is easier to manage and looks more professional when I straighten it. This product has truly made styling my hair for job interviews easier and faster.  I love that Olaplex is cruelty free and does not test their products on animals."

The product is very easy to dispense in exact amounts, and a little bit goes a long way; the viscosity of the conditioner is similar to a creamy serum, and is slippery (not oily) between the fingers. The fragrance of the conditioner is light, and reminiscent of clean-scented spa body lotion. My hair is curly (corkscrew curls to be more specific) and dense; it is also color treated, usually quite dry, so I was very pleased when I noticed that my hair felt smooth after applying the product to my hair and even made my hair extremely easy to detangle with my fingers. My hair was frizz-free, smooth and manageable, and felt light and silky. I appreciated that my hair did not feel tacky, heavy or like straw after I applied the product. I did note that the end of my hair looked smooth right after application, and that brushing my hair did not cause breakage. Overall, I am extremely please with the Olaplex No.5L Moisturize & Mend Leave-In Conditioner for Split Ends, and I highly recommend it for all hair types. My only caution is that women with dense hair may need at least 6 pumps for satisfactory coverage."

I've been using it for a  week now, and it's been a total game-changer for my hair.  As a guy in my 30s, I've started to notice my hair getting drier and more brittle, especially after washing. But this stuff has completely turned that around. It's like a drink of water for my hair - it's instantly hydrated and softened.  I use it after washing, it's got a really subtle scent that's not too fancy or overpowering. I've even noticed my hair looks healthier and more vibrant, which is awesome   What I love most is that it's not greasy or sticky at all - it absorbs really quickly and leaves no residue. I can use it on both wet and dry hair, and it's perfect for adding some extra moisture and protection throughout the day.  Oleplex has seriously impressed me with this product. It's become a staple in my daily routine, and I can't recommend it enough to anyone looking to upgrade their hair game."

To preface, I do not use conditioner in the shower as I tend to have greasy roots. I prefer using leave-in conditioner as it keeps my split ends from knotting after brushing. With this being said:   cons: -This product allows me to brush through my split ends and knots much easier, but I also noticed that the u201cmendu201d aspect of the product has not helped my hair much. In fact, I have noticed that when I am brushing the knots out of my hair I tend to lose quite a bit of my hair (this is to be expected when brushing knots, but I thought it would lessen due to the expectations of this product).   -The product does not have a strong scent or add any scent reallyu2014 my hair smells the same & not any nicer than other leave-in conditioners  (moroccan oil for example smells amazing).   -There hasnu2019t been a visible difference in making my curls look better.   pros:  -My hair feels much smoother using this conditioner than without it, and it appears shinier too.   -This conditioner allows me to brush through my hair much easier.   -The softness lasts, so after initially brushing my hair, the second+ times my hair is just as easy to brush through.   Overall:  I feel like this is a nice leave in conditioner & maybe with more time it will repair my hair better, but for the price that it is I do not think it is worth how expensive it is. If it was a bit cheaper it would definitely be better."

Another amazing part is that itu2019s a heat protectant also! My hair hold curls and has zero frizz on the ends or throughout. I Love all olaplex products and this one is especially a home run.  Iu2019ve been a hairstylist 24 years and this is the best one Iu2019ve used! Your hair will love this. This would be great for curly hair girls also!"

I found this to be a nice leave-in conditioner when I'm adding other products to my hair. So, this doesn't weigh down my hair on those days. But I prefer a thicker conditioner for my thick coily curls. Although I like the way this makes my hair feel and look, I don't necessarily think you need it. I would rather use a leave in conditioner that's cheaper, but I know works. I think getting a value pack of Olaplex is more worth it because the system seems to work better than by itself. Plus, you'll get more bang for your buck by getting more products than one. Overall, I would recommend trying Olaplex and give this product four out of five stars."

The first time I used it in the shower, I applied 3 pumps since my hair is so dry, but quickly realized that wasn't necessary. I also used it on my ends (shown in photos) to soften the dryness, which I usually cut off. As someone who regularly uses heat irons to tame my frizzy curls, I have some damage, but this product really helped tame the unruly look without needing to trim as much. I think this is a great dry end softener, which I havenu2019t found in the past. Thinner hair types should be cautious with the amount and focus on distribution, especially when using it on wet hair. The smell is pleasant too. With over 30 years in the beauty industry as a licensed esthetician, Iu2019ve tried countless products for healthy-looking hair. I definitely recommend this one, with a moderate hand!"

My hair reaches my mid-back and is fine and highlighted. That combination means I need heat protection and something that seals in moisture. I only need about a half a pump for my whole head, so I recommend using less of this product than you initially think youu2019ll need. No. 5 isnu2019t as thick as most leave-ins, and it seems easier to work into the hair than many other leave-ins.   Closing Thoughts: Iu2019ve noticed that my hair is extra soft, but No. 5 is easy to overuse, which makes my hair even straighter than normal. Oddly enough, my hair doesnu2019t look or feel nearly as clean on the second and third day post-shampoo, so I have to really be careful how much I use. This may be a unique situation due to my hairu2019s fine quality, but itu2019s important to note if you also have thin hair. Overall, very nice. 4 stars because it makes it very difficult to create volume when I use this product."

Therefore, this productu2019s bond repair technology does its magic while being a nourishing treatment, making it a perfect primer after I color and apply heat to my hair. I find it an intense heat protection before using any heating tools. The frizz is gone, and my tress feels soft and shiny. Despite it being highly moisturizing, it is shockingly lightweight and doesnu2019t weigh down my curls. I donu2019t see any buildup or oiliness as it absorbs quickly, so I see sleeker curls.

I was tired of the end of my hair looking fuzzy. I was amazed at how well Olaplex helped repair the condition of my hair even after the first use! You only need a small amount of this product and I would recommend following the directions on the bottle. I only needed one pump for my hair and i applied it mostly the the mid and ends of my hair. I avoided the roots of my hair because my hair tends to get oily and this can make it worse and weigh your hair down if you over do it. If you have oily hair, I would really suggest to use this on the ends of your hair. The leave in is very thick and may have a light scent that is barely noticeable. I loved how shiny, soft, and smooth Olaplex left my hair. It was easy to brush through and helps to detangle your hair. It does a great     job of sealing the split ends and made my ends smooth and no longer fuzzy! I like that you can use this on wet or dry hair. I also tried it on my hair when dry and it helped to make the ends of my hair smooth and soft. Again, if you use on dry hair. I would recommend only using on the ends, especially if your hair tends to get oily. I also really love that this product helps protect your hair from heat damage and continues to work on sealing your hair after use. I would highly recommend Olaplex Moisture and Mend Leave in Conditioner if you have dry, damaged hair, ir split ends. It will work amazingly well for your hair! *I received this product as part of a promotional review through Beautytap and this is my honest feedback."

I also have health issues that cause my hair to thin and be dry. I have not let anyone treat, touch, cut or do anything to my hair (besides myself this is of course) for over 10 years. I take PRIDE in my hair. With hair the length mine is, split ends are bound to happen. As well as the continued being pregnant, then postpartum, and pregnant again, my hair is in need of a lot of love after the last 5 years especially. Olaplex' leave in conditioner provided quick and noticeable results after the first use! I was and stil am truly shocked as per how well this works! This products packaging is right on point, sleek, and modern appeal to the eye. The pump is easy to use as well, making it easy to press one handed if needed. The formula, oh man!, it is so lightweight and really does an amazing job! A little goes a long way and really works into your hair well! I noticed right away how much softer, silkier, smoother, and overall healthier my hair looked and felt after the very first use! As I used it more and more, my hair became so soft, it was like my high school days! I honestly am blown away by the immediate results as well as the prolonged results I have and continue to see! This review was collected as part of a promotion. Even with that said, I am being 100 percent honest about my opinion on this product. I am a new HUGE fan of Olaplex!"

However, despite the initial promise, I found that the formula was a bit too heavy for my hair type. While Olaplex is renowned for its bond-building technology, this particular product seemed to weigh my strands down, leaving them feeling overly coated rather than nourished. Even with a light application, I noticed my hair appeared flatter than usual, losing its natural bounce and volume.  While I can see this working wonders for someone with thicker or more damaged hair, for me, it was a bit much. I appreciate the effort Olaplex puts into creating high-quality products, but this one just didnu2019t mesh well with my routine."

For reference,  i have fine curly hair that needs a lot of hydration. The first time i used it a put 2 and a half pumps because i have long hair, however,  i think it was too much because it weighed down the Curls and left me with a frizzy mess.  The second time I used about 1 and a half pumps and combined it with a curly hair gel.  Much better result! It kept my hair soft and hydrated and my hair looked more shiny and healthy.  I think over time,  the product also builds bonds in your hair and will only get healthier.

Brushing was seamlessly detangling. And after blow drying, my hair was the softest its been in a very long time whilst also appearing a bit glossier than usual. At least on my hair, this is everything I could have ever asked for -- a true all in one product that replaces the need for a lot of other hair products.

While I still have some split ends, this product did make a slight improvement in the health of my ends. My hair remained voluminous and did not look greasy! I highly recommend this product to anyone who needs repair and lightweight hydration! I received this product as part of a promotion."

As someone who's always on the lookout for products that can hydrate and protect my hair, this leave-in conditioner hits all the right notes. It's designed to be reparative, and I can definitely see why. From the first use, it made my hair feel softer and more manageable, while also tackling my split ends. I've noticed a significant improvement in the appearance of my hair since using it. My ends look much healthier, and I no longer have that frizzy, dry look. Hydration is another big plus. I have naturally dry hair, so the added moisture has made a big difference. My hair feels smoother, looks shinier, and is so much easier to brush through after applying this leave-in conditioner. It absorbs quickly, and my hair still feels light and bouncy after use. The Future-Damage Shield is also a huge bonus, as it protects my hair from styling tools that can heat up to 450u00b0F. This has given me peace of mind, knowing my hair is being protected from potential damage every time I blow-dry or straighten it.

It's intensely hydrating without being greasy, and I was pleasantly surprised at how little product I needed - just a small amount goes a long way.  The texture of my hair has improved significantly. It feels smoother, stronger, and has a brilliant shine that lasts until my next wash. I also love the subtle, fresh scent that lingers throughout the day without being overpowering.  Overall, the Olaplex No.5L has exceeded my expectations, and I highly recommend it for anyone dealing with dry, frizzy hair or just looking to give their locks some extra love."

I have type 2b wavy hair and I had been using regular conditioner earlier. I also have slightly frizzy and damaged hair with split ends.   The conditioner feels really light on application. I used it on damp hair. The conditioner dries quick and doesn't leave my hair feeling oily. Little conditioner goes a long way. I like that it doesnt have a strong smell.  I used this product instead of my regular conditioner and followed all other steps of my haircare routine. Since I have wavy hair, I also use a gel to define my wave. Inspite of that, the Olaplex conditioner has worked like wonder. I saw lesser frizz and more moisturized hair after each use and this lasted for atleast a few days. I would recommend this to anyone whose hair needs a little moisturizing and repair.   This review was collected as part of a promotion "

When using this product, I first noticed the scent was a nice, clean scent. It wasn't strong at all and simply smelled like hair care product, so I did not mind having it on freshly washed hair. I applied it about 4 inches up from my ends through the ends of my hair.   After air drying, I noticed my hair felt and looked softer in the places I used Olaplex No.5. My hair looked shinier as well. It appeared as though I had less damage and fall out from my ends than I normally do after washing my hair.   Unfortunately, my hair still became fairly knotted easily (a sign of damage) and made it difficult to finger comb my hair between washes. I also didn't like that this is mainly to apply to wet. The instructions say it can be applied on dry between washes, but when I applied it to my ends, it made my ends sticky."

First off, the texture of this conditioner is rich, but it doesn't weigh my curls down, which is a huge plus. After applying it, my hair feels instantly smoother, and the frizz is noticeably tamed. It also has this subtle, pleasant scent that isn't overpowering, which I really appreciate.  One of the standout benefits for me has been how it seems to really lock in moisture. My curls tend to get pretty dry, especially towards the ends, but since I started using this, they feel much more hydrated and bouncy. I've also noticed fewer split ends, which I wasn't even expecting.  Overall, Olaplex No. 5 has become a staple in my routine. It's not a miracle worker, but it genuinely makes my curls look and feel healthier. If you've got curly hair and are looking for something to help with moisture and frizz without the heaviness, I'd say give this a try.  This review was collected as part of a promotion"

After I apply this to my hair and let it air dry, it leaves my hair feeling so soft, smooth, and hydrated. It helps to reduce my frizz significantly which leaves my curls more defined. I typically use about a dime sized amount and apply from the mid shaft of my hair to the ends. I love that this has a pump applicator so you donu2019t have to use your fingers and dig into a tub or squeeze a tube. The leave in conditioner feels smooth on the hands and after applied to the hair. There is a very faint salon like scent which I enjoy! I have even used this on dry hair by taking a bit and running it over the frizzy ends of my hair and it works wonders that way as well by adding shine and reducing the frizz!

This product addresses my specific hair needs by delivering deep hydration to my dry ends and helping to balance my hair's overall moisture.  The formula, enriched with OLAPLEX Bond Building Technology, is particularly effective for my highlighted hair. It strengthens and repairs my hair structure, which is essential for maintaining its health and preventing damage. The leave-in conditioner smooths and detangles my waves, leaving them softer and shinier without adding weight. I appreciate that it can be applied to both damp and dry hair, and even on already styled hair the next day, without causing heaviness or buildup.  The lightweight nature of this conditioner ensures that my hair stays grease-free while receiving the moisture it needs. It keeps my waves defined and healthy-looking, avoiding the common heaviness of other leave-in products. While the scent can be a bit strong initially, it fades quickly and doesn't affect the product's effectiveness. By applying it mainly to my mid-lengths and ends, I can enjoy soft, shiny hair while maintaining a balanced scalp.  In conjunction with No.4 Bond Maintenance Shampoo and No.5 Bond Maintenance Conditioner, Olaplex No.5 Leave-In Conditioner has helped me achieve the healthy, manageable, and glossy hair I've been striving for.

I have previously tried a couple products from Olaplex, but this new leave-in is a new favorite for me!   I apply the leave in as one of the first steps in my curly hair routine, and I like to rake then scrunch it in to help my curls clump together and avoid frizz. This leave-in seems to do a great job of helping define my curls without weighing them down, and I think my curls have been looking beautiful since I started using this! I follow with a mousse and gel to help lock in my curls for longer.  This has a very light, almost minty scent and I actually really like it. Itu2019s not overpowering, and itu2019s actually quite pleasant. The consistency is perfect to offer a little bit of slip for brush styling if thatu2019s what Iu2019m doing that day.  Overall super happy to have this in my curly hair routine!  This review was collected as part of a promotion."

I always apply some product to my hair before detangling to give it some slip and help the comb glide through my hair. On a scale of 1-10 I would give this conditioner a 5 in terms of slip so it probably works better as a detangler for looser hair textures. It did make my hair feel very smooth and moisturized but I had to use way more than the 2 pumps that were suggested for thicker hair types.

I washed my hair as normal, but left it a little knotty to truly test the product. After a quick towel/air dry, I applied three pumps from mid shaft to ends and used the leftover product for my roots. My hair felt smoother while running the product through my hair and brushing was a cinch! I did my normal styling routine afterward and was very happy with the results! My hair was shiny, soft and knott-free! The only reason I did not give 4 stars is that I think the product is too expensive. I have had similar results with much less expensive products!"

This product is for all hair types and targets the concerns of split ends and dryness. The directions tell you the amount you need for fine, medium, and thick hair. I have gone to medium hair so I used one pump. The product applies smoothly coating all my hair with just one pump. The first time I tried the leave in conditioner I towel dried my hair, applied and then let air dry. The next day my hair looked very healthy. My layers POPPED making it look like I got a fresh hair cut. I think that was the leave in cream doing its work at repairing my ends. I used it on and off for a few days and my hair does feel nice at the ends. Overall, for the price point I think this is a great product for hair that needs some repairing. It leaves your hair looking healthy and also protects against damage."

My hair curled so easily with the conditioner when it is not as easy for other products. The curls bounced and with my brush, my hair detangled right away. All it took was two pumps per section and my hair was so easy to comb, section, and braid.

This is a really great light conditioning hair product that doesnu2019t weigh your hair down. Instantly, after the first use, I noticed my dry damaged hair instantly felt softer, silkier, and I noticed my split ends looked smoother/repaired. The Olaplex No.5 Leave-In Conditioner has helped tremendously with hydration, detangling, and shine. I loved that this leave in conditioner not only helps my hair look better but actually deeply repairs my hair preventing future damage with bond technology that helps strengthen hair. This leave in conditioner is also great for heat protection up to 450 degrees if you often apply heat styling to your hair such flat irons. Apply the Olaplex No.5 Leave-In Conditioner on slightly damp clean hair and before styling! I highly recommend Olaplex No.5 Leave-In Conditioner as a great product to help not only to repair past hair damage but also to prevent future hair damage!"

Upon receiving the product, I was immediately impressed by its sleek and simple packaging. The soft, minimalist design is sturdy and easy to handle, which is a plus when youu2019re using it after a shower. The texture of the leave-in conditioner light yet creamy is a luxurious consistency that spreads easily through the hair without being overly runny or thick. I typically use a coin-sized amount on damp hair after washing with my regular shampoo and condition routine. The first time I applied it, I was impressed with how easily it spread through my hair. My strands felt immediately coated in a veil of hydration. The fragrance is very  pleasantu2014without being overpowering.  After blow-drying my hair, I noticed an immediate difference. My hair felt softer and silkier to the touch. I can confidently say that it felt as though the frizz and flyaways had been tamed considerably.  Iu2019ve always struggled with dry ends due to my tendency to use heat-style with my hair frequently, but after incorporating the Olaplex No. 5 into my routine, the texture of my hair has improved noticeably. I've used this leave-in conditioner consistently for over a course of a  week three times and I can attest that it does deliver on its promise of moisture.  My hair maintains a healthy shine, it doesnu2019t leave a greasy or heavy residue.  On days when I want to wear my hair natural, I can simply apply a bit more product to damp hair and let it air dry; the results are beautifully are just as good.  Over time, I have noticed some lasting benefits. My hair appears healthier and more resilient; split ends are less prominent, and I am experiencing fewer breakages.

I am familiar with some Olaplex hair products and am glad to see that they are continuing to extend their line of bond building hair products.

Itu2019s a creamy consistency that is thicker than a hair serum and daily rinse-off hair conditioner but not as thick as a rinse-off hair mask.

Recently i was able to try OLAPLEXu2019s No.5 Leave-In Moisturize & Mend Leave-In Conditioner. I have tried several leave in hair conditioners and most of the claims never deliver. Which is why i was so surprised to see the results with Olaplex No 5.   It comes in a small plastic bottle very similar to the rest of the Olaplex line. The leave in conditioner is white in color and the texture is light and creamy. It has a mild fragrance that isnu2019t overpowering or unpleasant. I learned after my second try that a little goes a long way. I only needed a small dollop size amount for each section of my hair. It quickly absorbed into my dry and frizzy hair leaving them hydrated. After the first use i could notice the visible difference in my curl pattern. My hair was bouncier and retained my curls for a longer period. This multi functional product not only hydrated my dry, frizzy hair immediately but also continues to repair my cuticles and split ends. It also offers heat protection up-to 450F which is  perfect for me who uses heat tools for styling.   Overall i think this is an amazing product that not only delivers immediate results but also continues to protect your hair. It hydrates dry hair and helps mend split ends that causes frizz for most of us. This has quickly become my go to product after shower and i look forward to using it to heal my hair.

I also noticed that the ability to pump just a small amount of product from the container is very beneficial. Some products deliver an output that is too much and sometimes the product goes to waste. This product delivered the perfect amount. Once the leave in conditioner was applied to my hair, I felt like it became very silky. I also applied it to my daughter's hair ( who happens to be a swimmer) and it made her hair nice and silky as well. I was afraid the end result would be greasy, but this was not the case.

The formula feels luxurious and has a subtle, pleasant scent. Itu2019s definitely a must have in my haircare routine now! This review was collected as part of a promotion."

I am very picky with leave in conditioners since I don't want my hair to be super oily and leave a residue on my pillow. However, this Olaplex No.5 works great! Additionally, I've noticed my hair to be stronger and have less split ends. This also works great to help style my hair. I use this once a week and have seen my hair become shiny and look full and healthy! Defintely adding this into my regular hair routine on hair wash days!"

The texture of Olaplex No. 5 leave in is creamy and rich, but not excessively heavy, I like to activate the product by passing it through my hands first and then putting it on, this makes the application easier, since it is evenly distributed.  After applying it my hair felt more manageable and with less frizz in addition to providing hydration and control over the hair, the tips were more sealed in an exceptional way, they were not dry as normal, although my hair still felt damaged, the difference is huge After using it, the hair feels significantly more silky and manageable, even my hair looked smoother, this is due to the formula that helps repair the broken loops in the hair, promoting a softer texture and less prone to tangles.  Over time, I hope to find a greater improvement in my hair with the Olaplex No. 5 continuum and notice more changes.  But with this product the hair becomes stronger and less susceptible to future damage. Although the product may be somewhat expensive, the results usually justify the investment, especially if you are looking for a solution for damaged or dry hair.  It is an excellent leave in conditioner that provides deep hydration and effective hair repair."

I have fine hair that I color, and it can become very brittle and dry. However, I struggle to find an effective conditioner that does not weigh down my hair or leave it with residue. The Olaplex No. 5 Leave in Conditioner has been working well for my hair. This leave in conditioner has a light scent that isnu2019t overpowering. This acts differently, in that it seems to seal in the moisture instead of just coating my hair. I use one pump after washing my hair. I think this product would be especially effective for someone with extremely dry hair, or very thick hair that does not absorb water or other products well.

Plus, it seals split ends, making my hair look healthier. As I mentioned, I have the whole collection from Olaplex and I love their products. It's perfect for keeping my hair strong and healthy even with all the styling I do!  In addition, I remember reading that this leave-in conditioner works better and better with each use, and I can tell that it does.

After having my kids my hair has changed during each postpartum journey with my most recent leaving my hair drier than a desert at times. This leave in condition helped restore hydration leaving my hair soft and maleable. I believe It's a must have for everyone's collection and I couldn't be happier having it mine!"

When I first put this product in with wet hair, I saw that I had absolutely no breakage. Typically, when I use extra product products in my hair there is some loose hair. After my hair is dry, I noticed that my hair did not dry frizzy as usual. Additionally, when I brushed my hair, I had a lot less fallout than I typically do. My hair remains soft and conditioned throughout two days without washes. I will say that the product did not change the overall appearance of my hair. It will stop breakage to help my hair grow faster. I would recommend this hair product for anyone that is looking for an anti breakage conditioner to help split ends."

This leave-in conditioner is supposed to mend broken strands, leave your hair moisturized, and helps with all hair types. I love how it has a pump, so you donu2019t have to worry about the top opening. With the pump, you can control how much product comes out of the package. It has a creamy texture, and a light beautiful scent that is not overpowering to my senses.  It has been a year since I gave birth to my lo, and unfortunately I still experience postpartum shedding. Although my shedding has gotten better since I first experienced it, I still make sure my hair routine contains products that help with moisturization, breakage, and bond repairing. When I applied the leave in conditioner to my hair, It made my curls more defined. It helped with detangling my hair, and provided moisture.    Olaplex can be pretty pricey, so the only way I will purchase it is if there is a sale, or I have reward points to use. I really recommend this product to anyone who is trying to combat shedding. This is a good product for someone who does not like heavy leave in conditioners. This is a nice product for someone who is in between trims, and need something to help with breakage."

Its my new favorite for wearing my hair straight. I still absolutely love number 6 but I think that will be my wash and go leave in because it allows my natural waves to dry and not look frizzy. So if I want the same beach wave look, Ill grab 6. My hair also feels amazing, which most us blondes know maintaining the integrity of your hair is always a priority and task, this leave it not only helps with styling your blow out to ultimate smoothness but its also repairing your hair at the same time. Olapex never lets me down, this product is definitely 5 stars in my book!"

I struggle with split ends. I try all of the typical prevention techniques such as not washing it every day and sleeping on a satin pillowcase, air drying and getting a regular trim.  Even so, the split ends persist. This leave in conditioner promises to actually improve hair health and mend split ends, which is exactly what I need. I still saw a few split ends after having just applied this to my damp hair and letting it air dry.  However, overall, there are less of them than I normally see, so I think with regular use I will keep them under control in between hair trims.  I also notice that the ends of my hair feel less dry or stiff, and my hair feels smoother and more hydrated. For my hair type and length the directions recommend one pump.  The pump is quite generous, and I almost felt like I may have only needed half a pump. It has the texture of a lotion, and while it was drying my hair felt slightly tacky, but once it was dry, my hair felt normal again and no feeling of residue or stickiness. I like the smell, which is like a sweet candy, but not overpowering.  For touch ups on my ends on the days I donu2019t wash, I only need a small amount and it dries without causing clumping or making my hair look dirty and it has a nice shine.

Once absorbed, I did notice a difference immediately. My hair was softer, and when using heat styling, my hair didn't feel as brittle. I also noticed my hair was easier to manage while wet and didn't feel as prone to breakage. My only critique would be the smell; it's certainly not bad but I do wish it was a bit better.

Olaplex has such a great reputation and this leave in conditioner lives up to the talk. I use this on towel dried hair focusing mainly on my ends or anything below my shoulders. It does not weigh down my hair and does not leave it oily or dirty looking like some of these products can. It does, however, leave my hair shiny like a Barbie and extremely silky to the touch. Since I bleach my hair and am also mid 30s with more delicate hair, I try not to use too many heat or styling tools when it isnu2019t necessary and this leave in treatment allows me to do so while giving my hair a gorgeous shine that usually takes heat tools to do so.

As a beauty product enthusiast I appreciate that it's both a leave in conditioning product AND is a heat protectant. I've tried the other olaplex leave in conditioner product and like this one more for two reasons: 1) the pump is easier to use, 2) it has a minty scent that not overpowering. I also really appreciate that olaplex products are cruelty free and that they don't test on animals. My hair is softer after using this product and smells better too. It also is a fairly significant amount of product you get for the price point so the value is great too. I would love to try the olaplex shampoo and conditioner products as well. Will continue to regularly use this product and appreciate its multiple benefits."

I have very long, slightly wavy (2a) hair that reaches my butt so because of how my hair is, a good leave-in conditioner is a must for me. This product has a lovely scent that is on the lighter side and not overpowering at all. It has a nice creamy texture and a good amount of product comes out with just one pump. I first tried it on damp hair after the shower and it definitely helped to detangle my hair and made it easier to style afterward. My hair felt soft and hydrated after using it. I love that I could apply it to dry hair in between washes if needed. When applied to dry hair, I had the same effect of it helping give my hair extra hydration and while I haven't been using it very long, I feel it helped improve the appearance of my split ends and I feel with longer use, would help out my split ends even more. It didn't leave my hair feeling greasy or stringy at all and overall, it is a product I will continue using in the future.  *This review was collected as part of a promotion*"

Even with dry ends I don't usually use a leave in because they tend to make me greasy- even if only applying at ends it tends to shimmy up. That being said I've always dealt with split ends no matter how careful I am so I was more than willing to try this. One pump is more than enough for me. I enjoy the fresh scent but it sadly goes away quickly and I would mind if it lingered. I have tried using both after shampoo and conditioner and only shampoo and have found my hair feels adequately conditioned skipping conditioner. So if you lean oily you could probably skip conditioner when planning to use this.  Thankfully when using after both shampoo and conditioner it doesn't get my hair/scalp greasy but it doesn't seem necessary. It it far too soon to see if this will keep my freshly trimmed hair from splitting but I have no faults thus far. It does leave ends feeling extra soft and nourished so I'm hopeful!"

Unfortunately, I didn't see any improvement with my split ends bonding as it states it should and didn't help tame the frizz... makes me wonder then, how much moisture did my hair actually get?

Reduces breakage of hair making it strong and looks healthy. Can be use immediately after washing and hair conditioner. But, my favorite is using it between hair washes to seal and tame split ends. As its leave-in conditioner, easy to use anytime. Can be used on any hair type. Comes in pump packaging so, best for travel use and dispenses required amount of product."

This product can be used with your regular shampoo and styling tools. I like that I saw results after the first use. My split ends are looking healthier and my hair is so soft and shiny. This products contains a ton of ingredients  but it is vegan and color safe. The Olaplex immediately  seals the split ends and mends hair from the cortex to the cuticle.

Also, my hair didnu2019t feel any stronger than before. It kind of sits on top of my hair where my ends needs to be trimmed.

Now, my hair is shoulder-length, and the middle to the ends feel like straw, always needing extra care and deep conditioning. But guess what? I've been using this Olaplex stuff for about two weeks, every other day with just a couple of pumps, and I swear my hair ends are like, transformed. The curls aren't crunchy and dry anymore, and the ends don't look all stringy. It's like the texture and appearance have completely changed.

Usually by day 3 into post hair wash day, the ends of my hair get dry, but they didn't this time. I also air dried my hair and used this product on my ends when my hair was still damp. You can add this to dry hair as well, but I keep it just to the ends. The bottle is huge too, and you don't need a lot so it is a great value.

I love that I can also apply it to dry ends between washes to keep them looking fresh and healthy. The scent is light and pleasant, not overpowering, which is perfect for those who prefer a subtle fragrance in their hair products. I've also found that it works beautifully as a base before applying other styling products, ensuring my hair stays hydrated and protected throughout the day.  Overall, the Olaplex No.5 Leave-Inu2122 Moisturize & Mend Leave-In Conditioner is an excellent addition to any hair care regimen, especially for those with fine to medium hair types."

I think this would be ideal for very thick, coarse hair and damaged hair. For fine hair, it seems too much. I'll try a little less than a full pump next time and see if that makes a difference. This is a product that I feel requires some amount of experimentation to really see the benefits."

The packaging is cool, I love the finger pump, it's almost like a mousse would come out, but it's just a nice white cream. Also the size is great for taking with you on a weekender trip! It honestly packs a serious punch and allowed my hair to dry without being poofy or frizzy. It really emphasized the natural curls and kept them together better than my usual products. I would totally recommend this Olaplex Leave-in Conditioner to anyone with any hair damage and even if you don't have damage I think it will really make your hair shine and look healthy. I was really happy with this product and its outcome on my hair."

I'm sharing photos to see for yourself how well this product worked for me. My first photo is 2 days without washing my hair and is pre-Olaplex use. I used this product in place of conditioner, and after shampooing my hair. I let my hair air dry. Usually when my hair air dries, I have poofiness that needs tamed with a wax stick. Well, I didn't need my wax after using this Olaplex product! Photo 2: On another way day, I used the leave in conditioner after both shampoo and conditioner. I wanted to know if it was going to be too much in addition to my regular conditioner. Well, I'm happy to report that my hair wasn't greasy like I thought it could potentially be. Even better, this product doesn't just tame my frizz it also takes the place of my detangler spray. I'm so happy to add this product to my hair care routine. Moisturize and mend is right!

I use this product after taking a shower and towel drying my hair. I use about 1-2 pumps for my thick wavy hair. I then comb through the conditioner into my hair.

My hair is more soft and smooth now, with some defined curls. My only wish is that this product could offer a little more curl definition.

This conditioner is meant to help with detangling the hair and conditioning the hair. It smells good like some kind of soap. But the product doesn't make my hair softer or heavier. It is like I'm not using anything after applying it. I got more volume on my hair and it helped me a little bit with detangling. But sadly, I didn't see too much of a difference in my hair. I was expecting to get softer or healthier hair. I applied the conditioner on my ends and half of my hair. The hair dries and it looks the same as other days. After one or two days, it gets more moisture and looks like the after picture. I would recommend this conditioner because it didn't make my hair worse. I would recommend this product to people with fine hair or greasy hair. It feels very lightweight so it will help with volume. This review was collected as part of a promotion."

I decided to try first the olaplex leave-in conditioner on my hair ends that were not wet. They were so dry that I needed something to style them and moisturize them before exiting home. I used 1 pump and my hair felt instantly moisturized ! They got the weightless hydration needed without greasy results.  I also tried the olaplex leave-in conditioner on my clean, damp hair. Then I used my different hair tools. I love that that product protects my hair from styling damages and heat tools. My hair results after using olaplex were hydration and shine.  I love the texture of the product and it has a very light scent that smells very good and leaves a nice scent on my hair.  The olaplex leave-in conditioner is a very good quality hair product.

This leave-in conditioner claims to hydrate, soften, detangle, and seal split ends. As someone that has very dry ends and oily roots, this product worked amazing! The first time I tried the product, I noticed instant shine on the ends of my hair and it felt so hydrated! I'm guessing this is due to the split ends sealing technology in the product. I also love how this product prevents heat damage up to 450 degrees. I love that I don't have to use a separate heat protectant when heat styling my hair, this leave in conditioner works as a 2-in-1. No matter the hair type you have, I recommend giving this product a try. It has definitely made it to the top of my favorite leave in conditioners list."

I have long fine hair and this product works well without weighing my hair down or making it look greasy. A little goes a long way and I use one pump for my hair. I could use about half a pump if I did on my ends, but I have layers and I apply this leave in conditioner, starting at the end and going about halfway through my hair length. I love that the texture doesnu2019t feel silicone-y and reminds of a medium thickness lotion. Itu2019s not heavy and itu2019s not too rich for my hair. This product is easy to distribute throughout the hair evenly and I use it both when I air dry and when I use a hairdryer (works great both ways). My hair is left very soft, detangled and hydrated. This is a perfect addition to my haircare routine and I will continue using this leave in conditioner."

            "review_text": "I have long, thick hair that I love to style, but this also means I deal with some damage and dryness. I was excited to try Olaplex No. 5 Leave-In Conditioner because the Olaplex brand focuses on repairing and rebuilding hair bonds rather than just masking problems. This leave-in conditioner was unique in that it had the same consistency as a regular conditioner, which was different from the thicker texture of most leave-in products. On my first use, I applied too much since it's very concentratedu2014you only need a small amount.The second time, I used a smaller amount and let my hair air dry to see if there was any difference. I did notice that my split ends looked a bit better, but I didn't get the overall strong, frizz-free hair that I usually achieve with other Olaplex products. Normally, when using Olaplex, I can get away with not blow-drying my hair because it feels smooth and well-maintained. With this product, I didnu2019t notice much difference beyond the usual hydration and a more sealed look on my ends."

Iu2019ve recently judged the Clean Beauty Awards and Iu2019m a reviewer/content creator on Instagram.  For reference, I have bleached hair that is fine and fragile.  I was hopeful that this Olaplex product would help repair the damage I have inflicted upon it.  I washed my hair as usual, but did not condition it.  Of course after towel-drying my hair, my hair looked and felt quite coarse.  The instructions stated to use one to two pumps depending on hair thickness.  As my hair Is very fine, I only used one pump.  I distributed throughout my hair from mid-shaft to the ends.  During this process, my hair felt immensely more hydrated, softer, and smoother.  Due to the condition of my hair, I have only been allowing it to air-dry.  When it was dry, my hair felt so healthier and stronger!  It was actually shiny!"

Iu2019ve always admired Olaplex and the amount of science and technology that they put into their products. I recently tried the Olaplex no 5 leave-in conditioner and could not love it more. A little bit of it goes a long way and the texture melts into your hair. I have below shoulder length hair and I used a pump of the product and it was perfect. The scent is very typical of any olaplex product and lingers on your hair for at least a couple of days which i love! It can be used as a leave-in and it doubles as a heat protectant for upto 450F, I love how versatile it is! I didnt really feel the need to use a serum after I was done styling since this already left my hair feeling very smooth. It tames frizz and makes your hair very shiny! Iu2019m not sure if it did much for my split ends but i will definitely continue to use this to see if it makes a difference! I would highly recommend this to anyone looking to add a leave-in to their routine."

And in this case the leave conditioner has quickly become one of my favorites for my 3b curly hair. I really like that it leaves my hair well moisturized, with defined curls and no frizz but not at all oily or sticky like I usually get with other products. My hair is long and 2 pumps are more than enough to cover my curls evenly. I apply it from mid-lengths to ends, I prefer to avoid the roots because that way my hair gets the necessary volume and doesn't get flattened. My curls stay intact until the next wash, just wet them, untangle them, style them and that's it. This is the perfect leaving conditioner for my curly hair. I get a fresh look every day without needing to apply more product."

That's why I was so excited to receive this new leave-in treatment.  After using it for just a week, I have already noticed a significant difference in the texture and appearance of my hair. The leave-in treatment helped to restore moisture and shine, making my hair look healthier and more vibrant.  I also noticed that my hair felt softer and more manageable, with fewer tangles and frizz. I love how easy it is to use - just a small amount applied to damp hair and I'm good to go. It doesn't make your hair look greasy or oily either. Just beautiful healthy hair.  Overall, I am extremely happy with the results and will be incorporating this leave-in treatment into my hair care routine. Thank you, Olaplex, for creating such a fantastic product!"

            "review_text": "As someone who's battled with frizzy, color-treated hair for years, I've tried my fair share of leave-in conditioners. When OLAPLEX announced their No.5 Leave-Inu2122 Moisturize & Mend Leave-In Conditioner, I was intrigued but skeptical. Could it really live up to the hype of the OLAPLEX name?  When I first got my hands on the sleek white bottle, I was impressed by the packaging. The pump dispenser is a godsend for my clumsy morning routine. The product itself has a creamy texture that feels luxurious between my fingers. I was pleasantly surprised by the subtle scent u2013 as someone sensitive to strong fragrances, I appreciated that it wasn't overpowering.  For context, my hair is long, thin, and naturally wavy with a tendency to frizz. Years of highlighting have left it prone to dryness and breakage. My main hair goals are moisture, frizz control, and repairing damage from heat styling and color treatments.  The product spreads easily through my hair, and I can immediately feel it smoothing out any tangles. This alone has been a game-changer for me. Gone are the days of wincing as I try to comb through wet hair!  The first thing I noticed was how much easier it was to style my hair. Whether I'm air-drying for a natural wave or blow-drying for a sleeker look, my hair is noticeably more manageable. The frizz that usually appears as my hair dries is significantly reduced, and I'm left with softer, smoother strands.  My color looks more vibrant, and there's a shine to my hair that I haven't seen in years. I attribute this to the moisture-locking properties of the product and the famous OLAPLEX bond-building technology."

I have tried the other Olaplex products which work well and was happy to give this leave-in conditioner a try.  It worked well right off the bat.  I could feel my hair absorb this and condition after towel drying it.  It was not heavy and really conditioned it.  It didn't leave my hair heavy or greasy and a little goes a long way.  I used about half a pump since I have short hair.  The scent is clean and fresh and not overly heavy but is the same scent as most of their other products.  It works well with other styling products and hairstyle was easily attained.  I would definitely purchase this again."
