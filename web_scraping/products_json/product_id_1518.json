I think that the '62 scent smells like nutty sunscreen (which is not bad, but I do not want to smell like that on a daily basis, and definitely not in the winter), '71 smells like buttered popcorn (I do not want to smell like buttered popcorn), and Beija Flor smells like a fruity cleaning product.  '59 is a very cozy and inviting scent. It may even put you to sleep--not because it's boring, but because it's like a lullaby. If you want a scent that will relax you, this is the one. '59 is a sweet evening walk in the garden, whereas the other SDJ smells are very life-of-the-party: exhausting.  If I were to do a bit of creative writing about this smell...well, consider the following situation: you have baked a fragrant vanilla cake in your kitchen, and you left the window open. It is a slightly damp but cool and pleasant night outside. You go outside from the kitchen to a wooden porch, where you are surrounded by night-blooming jasmine. You take a deep whiff of moist, cool air. You can still smell the cake in your kitchen. That's what wearing '59 feels like.  Pros: Inoffensive and lovely. Great for layering. Lingers in hair and clothes.  Cons: It's a body spray and not a perfume. It has weirdly good staying power for a body spray."

It is not as youthful as let's say 68, but is still fun and playful. I feel like someone of any age could wear this fragrance when they just want to feel sweet and playful and delicious. This layers SO WELL with some of my other vanilla/musky/amber fragrances and when combined with the body butter...stunning. It lasts about 5 hours on my skin (6+ when combined with the body butter) which I feel like is really good for a body mist."

Cosmic doesn't smell the same as '59 but they smell really nice together--sweet and pretty.  Cosmic also doesn't have great staying power.  Le sigh"

However, it's a very sweet but also a smooth and soft vanilla with hints of orchids. It also smells a bit like candy in my opinion. I find it's very long lasting compared to the other SDJ sprays! However sometimes when I first spray it, it feels overwhelming for a little bit because of the potency which I don't normally experience, but the overwhelming sensation doesn't last long for me. It just maybe something to keep in mind if you're sensitive to scents! Overall 9/10!!"
