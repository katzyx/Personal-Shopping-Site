I'm a rule follower and it seemed beneficial for my skin (I recommend following the directions for use). I am 40 y/o and have combination skin. I used it every other week because it did leave my skin more pink after I washed it off. Pores are truly influenced by genetics but I think this helped clean them out, which helped my face look healthier. The specs in the mask stained the brush I used to apply, which doesn't bother me, but fair warning. If it wasn't so pricey, I'd buy it again. It's just not in my budget right now."

My toxic trait is over exfoliating - I constantly feel like I'm trying to repair my skin barrier (but doing a lot better lately - new year new me!). This mask is gentle enough to use it 2-3 times a week for half an hour each time. Try this!!  Tried the lapis oil and it's fine but nothing special"

Their BLUE TANSY RESURFACING CLARITY MASK is no exception to my enjoyment of their products. I have naturally oily skin, but as the weather gets colder my skin gets a little drier.  The gel mask is easy to apply and while it has a thick texture it's in no way heavy. I've been using it for a couple of weeks and I found that my skin looks more clear and I'm having fewer breakouts. It has a pleasant natural fragrance which is not overpowering for me is when I'm wearing it (this is significant because many fragrances give me headaches, but thankfully this product does not). I've noticed that my pores definitely looks smaller and are far less prone to getting blocked since I've been using it."

First, I want to acknowledge the attractive packaging and the brand's commitment to using natural ingredients, which initially sparked my interest. The Blue Tansy extract, coupled with the promise of refining pores, sounded promising.  However, upon application, I found the mask to be quite disappointing. The texture was thin and runny, making it difficult to apply evenly on my skin. I also experienced a slight tingling sensation, which, although not painful, was not particularly comfortable either. I understand that some people may enjoy the tingle as a sign of effectiveness, but it did not resonate with me.  Regarding the pore refining claims, I did not notice any significant improvement in the appearance of my pores after using this mask consistently over a few weeks. I had hoped for a noticeable reduction in pore size or a smoother skin texture, but unfortunately, the results fell short. I found the fragrance of the Blue Tansy BHA and Enzyme Pore Refining Mask to be quite overpowering. While some may enjoy the herbal scent, it was too strong for my liking, and I prefer skincare products with more subtle or fragrance-free options.  Please remember that skincare is a journey of trial and error, and what may not work for me might work wonders for you.  *gifted by Herbivore *"

My skin is extremely sensitive with a lot of adult hormonal cystic acne, particularly in my chin area, and large pores mainly concentrated to my T-zone. I do have a lot of textural, irregularities and hyper pigmentation on my cheeks. I am ashamed to admit that I had not tried Herbivore prior to my receipt of a blue tansy mask complimentary from Herbivore Botanicals to try in return for my honest opinion. First impression was that the packaging was very luxe and classy, which is always important to me as I am not attracted to anything trendy in appearance. Upon opening the box, the container that held the gorgeous ocean blue mask was also high-quality. Unscrewing the lid, I was a bit surprised to notice that there was no inner seal and the mask was immediately exposed. Herbivore stayed true to their name as when I open the lid, I could immediately smell a violet- like scent that had some herbal undertones and almost a light nonoffensive medicinal smell. The first thing I noticed about the mask was how it was a bit like a jelly, but then upon dipping my finger in it, it seemed more like a medium serum consistency. Reading the directions, I applied it to my entire face but concentrated, particularly in my T-zone to make sure all of my challenge areas were fully covered. Please do not be scared by the dark blue color of this mask and think that it will leave a heavy layer of that color post application. Because of the serum like consistency, it is so thin and easy to move across the face. It feels like a water-based gel moisturizer rather than a heavy mask. In fact, it has no color at all when applied properly. I left it on for 20 minutes and noticed in the beginning a very, very mild tingling sensation, but no burning or discomfort. As directed, I rinsed it off after 20 minutes was over, and there was no irritation or redness to my skin."

It worked so well for her I tried it for my breakouts and I can confirm first hand, it produces on what it promises. When you first apply them mask you can feel it cleaning your pores without your skin tightening. The sales rep at Sephora also said you can use it at night for spot treatment, which I have not done yet but would definitely try.

The colour range can be very large from beautiful teal blue to musty old grey green with black oily looking splotches, this is due to the nature of the product and is not that it has gone bad; however, it doesnu2019t look very nice like is advertised, so I understand other reviewers concerns. With the gross colour I find the product still works (the black dots are from separation not mold), but I do also keep mine in a mini fridge just incase. The smell is strong but tolerable unless itu2019s been opened for awhile or opened before. I find it gets stronger the longer itu2019s opened or if the u201csealu201d or lack there of has been opened.

Took a star off because the consistency is very thin and digging into the jar to apply feels kind of unsanitary especially for such a u201cnaturalu201d product without the typical preservation system. Wish it came in a tube that you squeezed out rather than an open jar."

I know I'm probably not supposed to keep a jar for a whole year, but I haven't had any reactions to an old jar so I keep using it...  I also told a co-worker about this as well and we're both fans for life.  The smell is pretty strong and definitely won't please everyone, but I'm willing to put up with it for the clear skin that I get in return.  It might sting a bit if you have sensitive skin. I recently tried to use this with Herbivore's Aquarius Cream and Lapis Blue Tansy Face Oil and I think that might have been a bit too much BHA for my skin to handle, so I stopped using the oil and reduced the mask time to 15 minutes (usually I do 20 mins, twice a week).  I also have never received a jar that wasn't a greenish colour.  I've ordered this from Sephora, Detox Market and from Herbivore's website themselves and the jar always had the greenish colour.  I'm not sure what colour it is actually supposed to be, but as long as my skin reacts positively, I will keep using it!"

I didnu2019t mind it when I was younger but Iu2019m getting older, the redness started to overpower the colour on my face. I use this mask around once a week now and enjoy the overall experience of it - how it feels immediately when applied, the cooling sensations, the immediate reduction in redness, but also how it also seems to clear up/polish up my skin once I wash it off. Will definitely repurchase when I am out. I know some people find the aroma and look off putting but neither of those things bother me, as long as I can see it working Iu2019m good."

My jaw actually dropped when I looked in the mirror the morning after. My acne was calmed and less red, and the actual pimples were smaller. The whole texture of my face was smoother (I have some annoying bumps on my forehead--they were gone). AFTER ONE USE.   The scent is wonderfully herby/earthy and the feel of it is very cooling and soothing thanks to the menthol. I just stick my finger to the bottom of the jar, and pull straight out, and that's plenty of product for my face.   Absolutely follow the recommendations: use for 4-5 days straight, then 2-3 times a week to maintain. Nothing has made my skin look or feel better. The hormonal breakout I had was pretty much gone in 1.5 weeks when it would've probably taken a month otherwise. HIGHLY recommend for the acne-fighting girlies."

I donu2019t know if itu2019s really helping my acne too much, but my skin does feel so much smoother after using it. I think I saw a couple reviews saying that it burned them, but if it leaves your skin red, you clearly have more sensitive skin than you think. Leave it on for 5 minutes to start and see how your skin reacts.  I only have a couple small issues with it. First, itu2019s kind of hard to wash off. I now only use it before I shower because I hate washing it off in the sink. Second, I saw all the reviews saying it grew mold after they had it a while, so Iu2019m trying to use it quickly and am storing it in a skincare fridge.

I use a mask applicator brush I snatched up on Shein for a buck to apply. Itu2019s a little messy, so I just use this one when Iu2019m in the tub. I have this trio of reusable fluffy facial rounds, each was for a different use but Iu2019ve long since forgotten. I use one of those to wash it off because theyu2019re great at removing makeup and just using my hands and water to rinse results in black stuff being left on my face.   I have hyper sensitive skin and this cleared up a mask breakout after one use. If you wear masks as often as I do and hate maskne, this helps. It also helps with hormonal breakouts. I usually will have 1-3 blemishes but theyu2019re gangster and wanna live rent free for 3 weeks.   I did just order the mask spray after I saw a TT video, so hereu2019s to hoping that helps.

I was pretty nervous to try this because I have dry and sensitive skin but I needed some kind of exfoliant in my routine and this has been on my u201cmust tryu201d list for a while. I used it for 3 days in a row at first and then 2x a week after that. It smells strong and that scared me tbh! I leave it on for 15-20m and my face so slightly red for an hour or so after, but this helps my face so much! My blackheads are coming to head or disappearing completely, I have barely any breakouts now, and my face is brighter and less red.

I feel like it helps unclog my pores, but also lightly exfoliate dull, dry skin. Itu2019s also non irritating, I believe thatu2019s from the tansy. Anyways, I cannot say enough good things about this product! I used to use the Lancer Caviar mask, and I think this one works just as well, but is less sensitizing! Itu2019s also half the price. I would absolutely recommend this product. I have no pore fillers or smoothers on in my selfie. No filters. Just some light powder foundation and my skin is healthy, smoother, and glowing."

I know some people have mentioned a weird smell, but I personally was really enamored by it - it does smell kind of herb-y but to me that just signified that there isn't any artificial scents or fragrances in it, only natural stuff. Even if the smell did bother you a bit, I personally think it would be worth it. I used this about two times a week, and my skin always felt rejuvenated, less red, and soft.   I will agree about the short shelf life that others have mentioned - I noticed some specks of something (assuming mold? not sure) around the lid and the glass walls of the container when I started running low, but at that point I had had the mask for at least four months. Because this is a natural based product, I think that aspect makes sense. For me, I was able to finish it before I thought I needed to toss it, but if you are not planning on using it every week I would maybe be wary!  Overall, I love this product and Herbivore in general. I have very sensitive skin that is prone to redness and acne so it is always really refreshing when I find a product that not only doesn't worsen those two things but actually helps mitigate them."

Fombined, these ingredients leave your skin feeling plump and refreshed.  The instructions recommend leaving on for no longer than 20 minutes and suggest cutting the time in half if you are prone to having sensitive skin. the mask comes in a thick glass jar with the screw off lid. The mask is high in Azuline which provides soothing benefits to blemish prone  and irritated skin. My mask is more of a teal color rather than blue but this is completely normal due to the natural ingredients in the mask.  After only one use my skin was visibly softer and the texture was less apparent. As with all skin care products, I recommend doing a test patch to ensure you donu2019t have an adverse reaction"

This mask has a bluish green color  that is gel like and in-between thick and liquidy. The blue tansy incorporated in this mask is the main ingredient. Its high in azulene which is what gives it the color and scent.  I was a little surprised that it was more green than blue, but because of the natural ingredients it can be either color. Now the scent is a whole other story. I'm not going to lie , I am not a fan. I love a good natural and herbal scent, but this one is too strong for me. I'm still able to wear the mask for the full 20 minutes , but with the off putting aroma I don't find it very pleasurable like some other masks. Still even with me not caring for the scent of it , I love the results I got from it.  All I can say is WOW!! I had a breakout in a couple areas on my face and this literally got rid of my acne. I was stunned at how well it worked. It reduced the redness and size of my pimples dramatically where they were pretty much non existent. I've never used a mask that worked so well for my acne. Not only did it help with my breakouts ,but it made my skin extra smooth and my complexion has been glowing everyday since I used it. Days ago my skin looked a hot mess, and this literally saved it."

I've only used it for 4 days, but so much of my acne has already cleared up!!! Like so fast. And my skin feels so smooth, and just looks so much better. I feel like it looks like I just got a facial recently. My skin is glowing after using. I'm still using my acne med with, in case anyone else is on the same boat. I also have had very large pores, and it's been difficult for me to wear makeup, even with other products I use to minimize my pores. Well this cleaned/ made my pores smaller after just one use!!   I also have VERY VERY sensitive skin, and this gave me no reaction whatsoever. I look forward to continue to using this!!!    Just be careful when taking this out of the box. The container is pretty slippery. I dropped it because it slipped out of my hands, making me loose like half of the bottle :( But still worth using. I recommend this to anyone with stubborn acne."

So--it's pretty hard to find the right balance of products for my skin, and it's REALLY difficult to calm my skin down when it gets upset (which is, like, way too often).  But this mask? I almost can't believe how well it works. It calms my redness and inflammation, smooths away texture, and stops breakouts in their tracks. The effects are immediate and also long-lasting.   A lot of other resurfacing masks are way too harsh for my skin (for example, Herbivore's AHA mask burns a lot and damaged my moisture barrier when I was trying to use it), but this mask just feels calming, with an almost cooling effect. Seriously--it saves my skin time and time again.   Also, it smells like heaven. Do your self a favour and try this one out."

This one calms my skin down completely while exfoliating it and since I started using it a few weeks ago, I've had no clogged pores, more radiant, healthy looking skin, a huge decrease in redness, and my skin is incredibly soft. It makes more of a difference in the appearance of my skin than any other product I use with the exception of sunscreen. Sure, it has a strong scent. But it's just sort of herbal and, honestly, I don't care how it smells when it works this well. And if yours is green, that's ok! It's supposed to vary in color from blue to blue/green to green."

I have combination skin with an oily T.zone. The mask completely refreshed my face, like I'd been for a professional facial. I love how soft it felt after the treatment. Definitely recommend this product. The scent is devine; it's fresh and herbaceous : like being in the forest after the rain.

But while it sits on your skin, it is cooling and refreshing. It seems to have lightened my skin and helped with blemishes so much. Itu2019s my favorite part of my skin care routine after a shower. The directions suggest to use it every day and then down to a few times a week. I canu2019t help but use it almost every other day just because I enjoy how it makes my skin feel and look. Bought my first jar two months ago and already halfway through. It is pricy but a little goes a long way.

First time was scary lol it smelt strong and almost like menthol minty... it tingled to the point I got a little concerned so I only wrote it 10 minutes to be safe because my skin can be very sensitive. I decided to give the mask another go as directed on the jar and the second time there was no tingling and I wore the mask for the full 20 minutes... washing off was easy and afterwards my skin felt amazing! Normally bha products make me break out but this just... like wow. For me personally I have to repurchase this mask for life because my skin and I are in love with it. I saw reviews saying it's hard to wash off but if you use the small amount as directed and wash off with lukewarm water it comes if very easy. The smell becomes pleasant with time and the texture it's a watery gel so a little goes a long way."

Additionally, I have acne scarring for the first time in my life.

Despite all this though Iu2019ve decided I wonu2019t be repurchasing anymore. I had a mini jar of it as a backup that I purchased about 4 months ago stored in a box and the box was inside of a drawer so it never saw light and it was in a dry environment, but when I cracked it open today it was definitely expired. It had turned into a dark green colour reminiscent of the bits that would stick to the bottom of the jars that I had almost used up and had for months. Disappointed that something Iu2019d thought of as a HG would go off like that but Iu2019m not surprised since Iu2019d seen many reviews about people saying theirs had gone bad as well.

Importantly, it doesn't irritate my highly sensitive skin (and basically everything irritates my skin).   However, over the past year or so, the company has started to water down the products -- I guess to save money. This makes the product extremely runny and difficult to apply without spilling it all over the sink counter. Not to mention the fact that the little spatula they include for scooping is rendered completely useless. Just charge us slightly more for the real product, rather than forcing us to use an inferior product. Very disappointing."

It literally smells like basil and tea tree which is like the best way to describe it, if youu2019ve used or tested UFO by Sunday Riley it smells very very similar & like refreshing, like you just mashed a bunch of garden herbs! I loved the way it felt on my skin during and after, my skin did feel really soft after, and quite glowy. I didnu2019t notice any crazy changes, I was going through a bad breakout when I tried it and it honestly didnu2019t do much for my breakout unfortunately but I do somehow still like this mask haha idk what it is but like I said I actually like the way it smells and it just feels nice to have on your face!

Texture was fine, no problems with the mask per se. Applied the mask to my clean skin and only noticed very mild tingling which wasn't bothersome at all. Waited, then rinsed off like usual with no noticeable issues. Although my face felt very smooth and soft afterward, what I was bothered by was the SCENT of the mask.

Second the protection lid was barely stuck on to it. So this means it was basicly an opended product. The air, bacterias and things you don't want in your face mask was seeping in since the product was made.  And finaly there was some of the product that was sticking to the sides of the jar and had started to mold. This company uses very little preservatives and already had to recall some products because of mold problems. I returned mine and was told that this is a commun problem with this product. Don't buy!

I have actually washed my face twice and gone to the extreme to spray my face with perfume. It literally smells like rotted pizza. Itu2019s burned into my pores. Itu2019s horrible. I just canu2019t.

BUY THIS. Read all the other reviews and just do it!! If youu2019re on the fence.... just do it! I am getting to the point where I can probably get away with feeling confident in a tinted moisturizer vs my normal Estee Lauder double wear foundation. Not 100% there yet, but I have only been using this for a week so I am looking forward to seeing continued improvement! I followed instructions on using it 3-4 days in a row at first, and then I started using it every other night in rotation with my retinol. Contrary to a lot of these reviews. I LOVE the smell. Love love love. Even if I hated it I would still use it. Best mask ever. Buy it!! Will post an updated review with before and after pictures.. like I said, itu2019s only been a week!"

People, youu2019re throwing away an amazing $50 mask for no reason.  If you still donu2019t trust it, do a patch test, which you should do anyway.  That being said, itu2019s not worth the price.  I get a custom formulated prescription trentinoin from Curology for $19.95 per month. I have mature, acne prone skin, so my custom formula is Retin A, clindamycin (antibiotic) and azelaic acid.

I have been using this mask for four nights in a row and with typically sensitive skin that reacts easily to products, I can leave this mask on for 20 minutes with no bad reactions.

I took a look in two boxes as i was going to purchase, and they were also green!  For reference, i have used this product before and loved it, so i know what the consistency and colour should look like!  There are no preservatives in this mask, therefore the shelf life isnu2019t as long as other products. My concern is that maybe Sephora has too many old blue Tansy masks in inventory that they are trying to offload.  Fantastic mask for congested acne prone skin.

I donu2019t mind the smell but I can see how those sensitive to smells would. Not a deal breaker at all for me.Once itu2019s on, you feel a bit of tingling after a few minutes but itu2019s not painful. The next day my skin is GLOWING. I feel my pores are cleaner/tighter & any acne on the edge of emerging is kept at bay after I use this. Usually, masks this effective also dry my skin out considerably and this one absolutely does not. Itu2019s now a staple for me. :)"

I was not expecting it to smell pleasant based off of some reviews, but itu2019s worse than I thought. I have the lapis oil and thought maybe it would be similar to that... nope. Itu2019s like cough syrup, super strong pine, and moldy wet towels. I applied the mask and it made me so nauseous. It actually made the back of my throat feel dry just from breathing it in. I took it off and can still smell it lingering, ughhhh... I thought I could push through it to try it a few more times but I really donu2019t think I can. For the price, I want a mask that I will enjoy and actually be able to make it through the whole jar.   Also the one I received is not blue, its green. Their pictures online are very misleading. Iu2019m wondering if that means itu2019s an older product and that explains why the smell is so off putting?? I wonder if the non-expired thing smells better?   Anyways- still giving 2 stars because I like herbivore as a brand their packaging is aesthetically pleasing, and the product did make my skin pretty soft after 1 use... but itu2019s just not enough. Iu2019m thinking I will exchange it for their prism mask instead."

There are a few downsides I've noticed to this product so far, but none significant enough to get me to stop using it. It find applying it with the applicator to be a bit tedious and time consuming, though I don't want to use my fingers because I don't want to waste any product. I also find it difficult to wash off and really don't want to resort to any soap or scrubbing to remove it. And finally, I do have sensitive skin so initially (maybe a minute), there is some heat (I wouldn't necessarily call it burning) though it subsides very quickly and I'm glad the description actually gives you a heads up about that because there are a lot of products that burn my face that aren't supposed to and I stop using. I don't find the smell overwhelming like some people. Sure, it's odd, but I can get used to it. And it's SO worth it for these results. Initially, it says to just it daily for a few days, and I would HIGHLY recommend following that instruction before slowing down to once or twice a week."

I am a big believer in nourishing my skin and moisturizing it during breakouts. A lot of acne products I feel like (I am not a professional) damage your skin. This product stood out to me as it had decent ingredients. I have since used up my bottle. If my skin is ever in a situation like that again I will buy this product in a heartbeat.  I will say it does go bad and you can visibly see it. This just means you need to use it in the specified time you have it. Which is both sad and good. Sad because I have a hard time remembering to use masks, especially when my skin is good. Good because it means I am using products for their specified time and not hoarding products that have gone bad but still work.  I would definitely recommend this product if you are having issues with breakouts or texture. The smell isnu2019t nice but I didnu2019t hate it. It smelt kind of a little like seaweed and dirt, which I would prefer than having something full of fragrance as they donu2019t benefit your skin.

I didn't mind the smell as much as some have mentioned in their reviews, but it was quite potent and perhaps not for everyone. Sadly, a few others in their reviews mentioned they received the product in this condition. Hope I can repurchase this when stores reopen, be wowed, and change this review!"

I contacted Sephora customer service to find it out if it was ok to use, and they told me it's hard to say and that I should probably discard it to be safe, as I had just exceeded the possible return date.  Lesson learned- inspect your products as soon as you receive them, especially if you don't plan on using them right away."

If you have sensitive skin Iu2019m not sure that Iu2019d recommend because it will sting at first, it wasnu2019t so bad for me because I do no have sensitive skin. I havenu2019t had a breakout since about a week after first using this product. The texture is kind of like a gel that will dry and sit on your face for 15-20min.

I do feel my skin is less oily the night and even the next day, but I'm not sure if it does any change to my skin texture-wise.  I wanna remind y'all though that from my personal experience with this product how much I use each time does affect how great it works - if I put a thick layer on the anti oiliness effect stays longer.

Post-mask I use a Niacinamide + Copper serum and a moisturizer with HA. That routine has proven to work to reduce new acne from forming, ease lingering red spots, and heal any active acne. I find myself reachung for this mask over my other AHA+BHA treatments/masks. Unlike those products, this product has been much gentler on my skin, and for me, this product has been more proactive/productive.   Note that this mask is of a gel like consistency that can range slightly in both consistency (some batches being slightly more gel and some a little more liquidy) and color (ranging from blue to dark green). This is normal for this product. The smell is not my favorite, and I found it quite pungent for the first couple uses, but I'm better able to tolerate it now. It doesn't smell bad, just different."

I think it smells like a mix of gummy bears and natural floral scent... like a flower I canu2019t put my finger on, with the sweet smell of candy. Anyway...  This mask literally does nothing. Iu2019ve got it twice now as part of larger orders and both times Iu2019ve been unimpressed. It goes on fine - although a bit too viscous to be easy to use, and dries does to a tighter mask feeling. You wash it off and the next day... nothing. I expect more from something this price.   (Mine has never been mouldy or gone bad for the record - atleast that I can tell. I can tell it starts to change because when I first get it itu2019s a vibrant teal, but after opening usually subsides to a deep blue, but the smell and texture stays the same. I do believe what some people consider mould is just the product drying. Because itu2019s thin it gets on the lid, and then settles again, causing the leftovers on the lid to oxidize and dry, creating what looks like u201csplotchesu201d but what I believe is just dried bits of product."

I had read that the shelf life is very short and some are delivered expired so I surmised that must have been why. Customer service shipped me a new one right away and I was disappointed to see that the new one was even worse - a deep, unsightly color with visible mold spores. Neither looked remotely like the photos on the site. Unfortunately, I had to give up on trying this one after two spoiled products."

My skin does look brighter and my acne scars donu2019t look as visible but then again my skin had a red tint so the scars kind of blended in. Also, something that I thought was pretty strange is that my pores were enlarged and visible... not exactly sure why. I will continue to use this mask and get my moneyu2019s worth but I kid you not itu2019s been at least 30 minutes since I rinsed it off and I still feel nauseous. My skin is still red.

The results from this mask have been INSANE. I use a lot of ahas and bhas in my skincare so I only use this mask twice a week but it helps calm inflammation, heal blemishes, even out the tone of your skin, and literally WIPE AWAY acne marks. It does nothing for acne scars (pitted) but nothing typically works for those aside from actual procedures like microneedling. If you breakout occasionally and already use something like a retinoids, glycolic acid, or any other strong ingredient, this would be amazing to add to your routine. If you have sensitive skin and a tingle freaks you out, itu2019s not for you. Personally, I like treatments that actually do something. If I could give it 10 stars I would."

It cleared up my close to surface acne in pretty much a single use, meaning this seems to be a good product if you are a little neglectful in your skin care (like me). I have yet to see if this helps with my hormonal acne, and it does not seem to do much for large pores or blackheads. But it definitely not only helped diminish pimples but also brought the redness and soreness down too which really helps. It's pretty much a liquid, which I guess is nice because a little goes a long way. I have sensitive skin and unlike other reviews, don't think this product is harsh or overly tingly on skin. My only biig drawback is the smell. Honestly, this product smells like someone tried to spray a fruity air freshener over a lake. Going off the ingredients (I see a fermented component), I guess this makes sense. So if you have regular troubles with surface acne, and don't like the drying out feeling of clay-based masks, this is definitely worth it."

This product is already known for having a very short shelf life and when I receive it, it was dark green and lumpy and almost had a stomach acid scent to it. The previous time I purchased this product had a nice light blue slippery, gel-like consistency. And smelled like blue tansy and other chemicals. Still better than the nauseating stanch coming from the new one. Either the company changed their formula or sephora needs to keep track of the freshness of the products they sell.

Weu2019re talking full on sandpaper appearance if I donu2019t address it. This is the best product Iu2019ve ever found for getting rid of that congestion. It works much better than any of the glycolic acid products Iu2019ve tried. I use it a couple times a week and it keeps my skin texture looking smooth as glass. I also suffer from splotchy redness and this helps with that as well. Personally, I really enjoy the bracing, medicinal scent of this. It makes me think of an Icelandic spa. I find that for me, this product pairs really well with Sunday Riley Tidal Enzyme Water Cream (I guess my skin really likes enzymes), and Sunday Riley Luna Night Oil. I will rebuy this again and again."

To be honest, given the price point I expected a little more of a skincare miracle, so Iu2019ll probably shop around for other resurfacing enzyme masks before repurchasing this one.

It's pretty liquidy but once you apply it, it stays in place,  it doesn't get hard or tight which I enjoyed. I have sensitive skin and this did dry out my cheeks a little but a little extra moisturizer and I was fine plus it didn't exacerbate my redness. The instructions it comes with say to use for 3-4 days in a row and then maintain a couple times a week so that's what I did. I'm on day 4 now and I can definitely see a difference!  Day 1: Slight tingling felt throughout masking time but not unbearable. Scent is strong but not unpleasant. Once rinsed off my skin was so soft and smooth. Blackheads in my nose that I've probably had since high school were gone! No joke. I have large pores and they almost looked bigger after but they were 100% cleaned out. Day 2: Some pores had kind of gotten gunky again but this cleared them up completely again! Pores right around my nose are still a little big (which is normal for me) but everywhere else seemed smaller before and after masking again. Day 3: A few small spots came to a head but were much easier to get out than usual. Majority of my skin is completely Scot-free, pores still appear smaller and cleaner than usual. The tingling was also less noticeable this time.  Day 4: Woke up to 1 spot, all others are gone. Pores still appear smaller and cleaner. My skin does feel somewhat drier than usual but nothing drastic.  Plan to mask one more time tonight and then transition to 2-3 times per week as suggested. I love this stuff!

The smell of this isn't my favorite, but it's something I've adjusted to (but that first night it kind of gave me a headache so knocking off a star for that since scent sensitive people should be on the lookout). I've since upped it to 10 minutes at a time and definitely notice a difference between the time when I don't use this mask consistently and the times that I do - namely, that my skin seems more congested and oily, a lot duller.

I was looking for something to get rid of my blackheads and to keep acne away without stripping my face of essential moisturizer or rubbing toxic ingredients on it! I was surprised to find an all natural, vegan and cruelty free brand from Sephora. Though Herbivores prices are high, I still needed to try some of their products because I was having a very hard time finding any clean skin care at the drug store. I bought mask in the blue tansy facial oil and mask duo set and I loooove the Lapis oil in the set and I loved this mask, though I didnu2019t get enough of the mask to use more than 4-5 times. Thankfully the directions say to apply a thin layer. So I was able to spread it out to 4-5 uses. I didnu2019t follow the directions, sadly. I did the mask once a week instead of every other day for 5 days. I really wanted to make it last and not waste it but I feel if I had followed the directions, I would have gotten better, longer lasting results. However, everytime I used this mask it helped to heal acne scars, acne and cleaned a lot of blackheads out of my pores. It also evened my skin tone, hydrated and make my skin soft! Iu2019ve also tried the prism mask and the brighten mask and I feel that the blue tansy gave me the best, immediate results. I have only tried trial sizes of the 3 masks though and I did not do any of them as frequently as the directions said to do them. I am going to buy this full size to really put the directions to the test and see what kind of results I will get. Since I switched to clean skin care, I havenu2019t gotten any acne and I have barely gotten any blackheads!!! Herbivores PHOENIX, Lapis and Emerald CBD oils are my favorite that I have tried! Their all amazing and I honestly donu2019t know which one is my top favorite. I have stopped using moisturizer since I have gotten them and I use a different one every day! I cannot wait to try some of Herbivores other products and it is going to take some time to do so given their high prices."

It would start pretty red, and than dry out and flake of. Still unsure what provoked it but only thing that seemed to have helped at that time was heavy duty prescription hormonal ointmnet (much heavier than hydrocortisone).  Wanting to go off of hormona stuff I was looking for a good mask in hopes it will take care of it.  Based on research of ingredients  and reviews I got this mask a while ago (5 months plus), and used as directed for a few weeks. It did have small effect on my pores but nothing to be crazy about. So ive neglected this product for a bit.  Last month I came across blogger's article which said that, basically, certain masks (especially of peeling or resurfacing categories) should be really left on for an hour or more, depending on skin's sensitivity.  I decided to give this mask another go but leave it on for much longer and ...holy mother of god, my pimple-like rash started to heal and is almost gone! My skin overall looks better, I wouldnt say it has retexturized it completely but its on its way.  CONCLUSION: I think the KEY(and only if you can handle it, at your own risk and discretion)  is to try leaving it for a longer period of time , and use it every 2nd or 3rd day consistently.Dont have to use a lot of it either (learned it the hard way) but thin layer will suffice. Happy masking!"

My skin is also pretty white therefore my scars show easily. My life changed about a year ago when I started using the Clarisonic (holy grail) as well as using the Sephora vitamin c serum. Scars started to fade away and acne started to diminish. I still noticed my large pores on my cheeks and nose though and it bothered me so I decided to invest in this (a little pricey)... Iu2019ve been using it for about two weeks now (3 days in a row at first) and DUDE... My skin is amazing. My pores are barely visible and I feel so confident without even using makeup. Itu2019s not a lie when they say resurfacing. Also, it does sting at first. You can literally feel the old layer of skin being resurfaced.. itu2019s insane. The stinging stops after using it for a while and itu2019s heaven. BUY."

Unfortunately the day I recieved this product in the mail it had mold growing in it. The product was a more green than in the picture and was very liquidy to the point I almost spilled some when I opened the container. I went to use this mask as soon as I got it and finding brown spots inside it was increably disappointing. I did some more research and found that due to Herbivores tendency against preservatives, it is not uncommon to find mold in their products long before you should. Due to this experience I'm not buying from them again. And I would urge the company to use preservatives or take the product off the shelves."

This mask brightened my skin in the first 3 uses (consecutive days) and pretty much cleared all my small spots by day/use 3. Now I use it for maintenance to keep scarring minimal and I do the same 2-3 consecutive days of use around the beginning of my period to clear any breakups gently. I follow up with lots of hydrating products and sun screen during the day. Awesome mask, will definitely be repurchasing."

In the past year I have become a skin care fanatic, I have tried multiple different brands and products and this one right here is by far the best one to date. Once the mask is on you begin to feel a slight tingle and that is when you can sit back and let the magic begin. The smell is herbal, yet soothing. The bottle is beautiful. And we aren't even to the results yet. Once the mask comes off (which takes a little more effort than I am use to) you are left with very soft, glowing skin. I use this mask three times a week and I just cannot get enough. I am a nurse and during the winter time we have to where masks most of the time. This has caused my skin to become dry and red because of the constant irritation, this product has saved me.  When I started to get into skincare I thought that $40 for a mask was insane, especially when the bottles were so little. But you pay for what you get. I highly recommend."

First of all, no other u201cresurfacing masku201d does itu2019s job quite as well as this one does without making my VERY sensitive skin very angry.

My birth control skin (even, clear, radiant) is back AND Iu2019ve seen a serious improvement in texture, too. I also feel that when I use it in the evening time after I wash my face and before my serums, everything absorbs a lot better.   Iu2019ve read other reviews that complain about the smell, which is definitely strong, but I donu2019t mind it, I think itu2019s nice and naturally floral.

I haven't has any new breakouts, and my face is way less red. At the moment most of the marks on my face are discoloration and scars from old blemishes. I read a lot of reviews that complained about the smell of this stuff, but while it's definitely strong, I don't think it smells bad. I have fairly sensitive skin but I didn't experience any tingling or dryness. Hopefully the marks will continue to fade and this mask will continue to work.

The corners of my nose, mouth and chin are often times flaky. And I have seasonal and hormonal acne breakouts! And addition to it all, my skin is typically red and sensitive.   Only the first week of using is and this mask has helped calm my skin when it's irritated, moisturize the dry spots, balance the oily spots and bring out deep congestion the the surface! Just remember - sometimes things get worse before they get better. More white heads seems typical for this kind of mask since it draws out impurities.   Wipe off with a warm damp cloth, you see better results this way rather than rinsing it off with water.   I will say this: my skin is typically worse when I eat like garbage and drink little water.   A few tips:   THIS MASK WILL NOT DO YOU ANY GOOD IF YOU CONTINUE YOUR UNHEALTHY LIFESTYLE CHOICES. Drink more water than alcohol, eat nourishing foods, SWEAT, wash your face, moisturize day and night, wash your hands before you put on face products, pat dry with clean towels, make sure you're applying your regimen products in the correct order, read a self love book and enjoy this friggin awesome mask!"

Until someone recommended the blue tansy mask.  I followed the instructions to use the mask frequently the first week and then slow it down the following week and so forth and I have to say, WOW.  This mask minimized the zits on my face and had them disappear. Not only zits but some white/blackheads as well disappeared.  I know some people are complaining about the smell but honestly it isnt that bad and also I would take this smell over acne any day!

I did buy the full size since I want to be able to use the mini for when I travel. The consistency is thin and so you really donu2019t need a lot for the face as it spreads on the face easily.  Since I have sensitive skin, the acids do tingle when I put it on. I leave this on for about 5-7 minutes and then I wash it off. My skin is not red or sensitive after usage either. Like I said, because this is a pretty acid heavy mask, I only use it once a week to really cleanse my skin. I would recommend on only focusing this on your problem areas if you have sensi skin like mine."

I am really wary of using essential oils on my skin because most seem to irritate my skin and flare up my rosacea. Also Herbivore doesnu2019t use preservatives, which has caused moulding issues and recalls of several products. Despite what some want you to believe, preservatives arenu2019t the devil (including parabens if you actually read the studies done).   Anyways, I got a sample of this in Sephorau2019s clean skincare sample bag and wasnu2019t expecting much - I have many AHA/BHA products so this was probably not going to do much. I have a skincare routine down that I follow meticulously and while my skin looks pretty good, my rosacea has always never really settled down completely.  This mask has gotten rid of any remaining rosacea redness. Including the major flushing I still seemed to get. In just a couple uses :/ I donu2019t know how, but it sold me on the product and I bought it immediately from Sephora. Iu2019ve had a few weeks to use it now and still having consistent results so I will absolutely repurchase. Bonus is that itu2019s a fairly gentle aha/bha product and so it keeps my skin exfoliated (although I still use my stronger products on some alternate days). Although if youu2019re solely looking for exfoliation, I donu2019t know if Iu2019d start here since the price tag is so steep. (The Ordinary has a great, and cheap glycolic acid toner)   I highly recommend!"

I accidentally spilled some of it when I was about half-way through, and applying it without dripping isn't easy.   I really wanted to like this product. It smells nice, it leaves my skin a bit softer. (My skin has a very high turnover, so I prefer pretty heavy-duty exfoliation.) But because it's in a jar, you can see the product oxidize, and it's easy to make a mess. Putting this into a pump would really save a lot of grief, making it easier to apply and not spill. Yes, I could buy a pump but for $50, I think the onus should not be on the consumer."

The oils in the product had also separated, resulting in a light blue oil slick on the top of the mask (which also looked like it had growths in it) and it had a rancid smell.

I waited the allotted 20 minutes and washed it off. My skin felt soft, but it was only my first time using the mask. Two days later I went to put it on again, but as soon as I unscrewed the cap, I wanted to vomit once more. It smells like rotten spearmint, if that makes any sense. I have never had such a visceral reaction to a smell, especially in a cosmetic/skin product. I couldn't bring myself to use this mask again, so, sadly, it had to be returned. So, I haven't been able to see if this delivered on skincare results. Since then, I've read other reviews and everyone mentions the smell being earthy and fresh and clean. I'm wondering if maybe I got a bad jar? Unfortunate, but for the best. Now i am phantom smelling blue tansy mask..."

My skin feels refreshed, soft, pores are noticeably way more clear and calm plus I havenu2019t had any major breakouts.  Itu2019s smells nasty but you get used to it. Iu2019d take the price point and smell any day with the way it makes my skin glow the next morning.  I pair it with either the 100% organic cold pressed rose hip seed oil from The Ordinary before bed or I use it with the Herbivore Pink Cloud cream if Iu2019m doing the mask in the morning. Either way, buy this."

I believe I am hopefully approaching the end of a few-yrs battle with hormonal acne, but have very clog-prone and hyper pigmented skin. I was surprised it had such a runny texture, and it was extremely difficult to get off after 15 mins (super sticky but dries up quickly, pretty gross). Even scrubbing excessively with a washcloth still left some blue residue / tint. Afterwards, I feel a slight cooling sensation which is refreshing, but this product is HIGHLY fragranced. And let me tell you, it smells terrible! Since it is so difficult to remove, that smell still lingers. This is the first time I've ever turned down a product due to smell and texture, because it does seem to be effective and accurate to the description, but I just can't get behind it."

The mask didn't tingle or dry out my skin. It didn't feel moisturizing either. I really didn't notice any results at all.  I was hoping it would help clear my cystic spots and discoloration so I was a bit disappointed with the outcome, especially given the outstanding reviews. I wasn't particularly bothered by the scent, though it was definitely unusual. It reminded me of blueberries and herbs if anything. If you are sensitive to scents, I recommend trying it out in-stores first. I'm giving it three stars because I would use it if I had it on hand, but I wouldn't buy it myself."

My complexion just looked amazing overall. Iu2019m totally sold. I will have to do an update later on but I canu2019t see how it can get worse. A little background on my skin - I have oily skin with hormonal acne. Tonight I actually had a big red pimple on my nose and some around my upper lip which seemingly disappeared after the mask. No redness. Nothing! Honestly if you have acne or redness, I urge you to try a sample. You wonu2019t be disappointed!"

Acne always lingers, dont recall how I came across this product but I remember my skin cleared within the week and I was amazed!!! I used for a few months with clear skin, then I got pregnant and had to stop using :( Acne returned for the 1st trimester then the rest of my pregnancy I had clear skin due to the pregnancy hormones. After giving birth and stop breastfeeding I am back on the blue tansy train. I have tried the tata harper resurfacing mask that does about the same thing as blue tansy but blue tansy is cheaper :) Does it smell? yes but not horribly and after 2 mins you do not smell it anymore, at least I dont. Skin is left clear and smooth, there are times I have slept with it on. If I have a period breakout I will use this for 2-3days straight and pimple dries right up. Reason for 4stars and not 5 is I do think the packaging needs to change, a pump will be better to not damage the rest of the product every time the jar  is open, but the product itself will forever be part of my skin care routine!"

I think a pump would help keep this product clean and allow its highest efficiency.. but anyway. THIS MASK IS A HOLY GRAIL. I donu2019t see myself not living with this and Iu2019ve thrown all other masks away. I have struggled with acne my whole life, had to go on accutane twice and still get a few pimples here and there, although accutane has helped the rate at which they disapear. I feel like this masks helps almost instantly. I personally love the smell, because i tend to favor more earthy herbally smells. The texture is runny which is why i think a pump would work with this. You only need a thin layer and you hardly see it on, but it tingles and feels soothing to me (unless you use it too much or have it on for too long haha). When i wash it off, my face instantly feels smoother and any breakouts i have are instantly calmed. I recently had a few breakouts and weird little bumps forming around my mouth, i put this on in haste and my skin was clear the next morning. If youu2019re on the fence about this, GET IT. Itu2019s so amazing!!"

This was actually gentle enough to use every 3 or 4 days. But did not dry out my skin. As always, moisturize after use. This product is a thin watery gel consistency, so it kind of goes quick. The blue color is very pleasing to the eye. Went through the jar, and will definitely repurchase. I put mine in the fridge before use, so its cool on the skin. A good price as well!   I would compare this to the Tata Harper resurfacing mask, my holy grail.   As far as pricing, it's reasonable 2 oz for $48."

Furthermore, my skin feels cleansed and firm, my pores appear smaller, and I see improved elasticity and glow. All around my skin feels a million times better and healthier. The mask itself is not thick and is somewhat viscous and I have an easier time applying it with my fingers as opposed to the applicator that is included. Other purchasers have commented on the smell, and while it is a bit strong, it dissipates fairly quickly and the closest odor I can compare it to is tea tree oil. Definitely an amazing purchase for the amount and quality of the product. I expect it to last at least 3 months with near daily use. For reference, after washing off with a damp washcloth, Iu2019m following up with Murad SPF 50 in the mornings, and continuing with the Retin-A and Murad Hydro-dynamic Ultimate Moisturizer in the evenings.

The consistency is almost like jelly which makes it so neat and easy to apply, and take off. It goes through stages of heating and cooling and the scent is unlike anything. After 3 daily uses my cystic flare up is almost completely flat, less red, and most importantly doesnu2019t hurt anymore!

I started getting adult acne in my mid 20s out of nowhere (thanks grad school), and tried just about everything to get it to go away from Proactiv to Curology (for >1yr), and nothing really worked to clear anything faster or prevent new pimples from cropping up. I FINALLY found this mask while sifting through skincare in the Sephora app. I used the first jar pretty heavily, applying it every day for at least 20 minutes for a solid 7-9 days straight and then backed down to every other day. About halfway through that first jar my skin was BRAND NEW. Honestly I can't overhype it enough. Before, my forehead was straight up cobblestone, even when I didn't have big red pimples, it never felt or looked smooth. And now it's incredible and perfectly smooth. I haven't seen or felt my skin this smooth since basically pre-puberty Era (let's get real though, it'll never look or feel as perfect as it did when we were kids and couldn't have cared less about it). But if you're on the fence about this product and you're struggling with adult acne (not sure about inflammatory acne-- it may react different) TRY THIS. You absolutely won't regret it. I put it on right after the shower 3 days a week now, and just chill for 20 minutes while it dries on my face. The smell is pretty strong, but it's fruity so I got used to it and enjoy it now. I do recommend following it with at least a light moisturizer afterwards but I haven't found it dries me out super crazy without it."

Immediately after using this mask, my face was much softer and felt more supple. After about a week of use, my face started to purge. The areas like my chin and forehead where I always had bumps under the skin before began to breakout. This lasted for two weeks..  I have stayed consistent with using the mask about every other day and the lapis oil each night. Iu2019m happy I stuck with it! My skin is now very soft and my breakouts have improved greatly. I am happiest, though, with how much these products have improved the red patches on my face! The mask is gentle and did not dry out my skin. Combined with the Lapis oil, I have no dryness whatsoever anymore."

Another bonus, I've never had any irritation or dryness form using this mask, it's actually the opposite, I find after using this mask my moisturizer really absorbs and I feel more hydrated.

Iu2019m not sure about anti aging or anything (I donu2019t have wrinkles or anything), it does make my face feel tighter but all masks kinda do. I saw some reviews saying the smell is horrible or that it burned, but if you have NORMAL (sensitivity wise) skin (that you still wanna be very gentle with) and combo/normal (occasionally a bit oily) skin type, listen up   1)the smell is not that bad. Sure some may not like it, but it just kinda smells like a natural cough medicine (in a not so bad way). Donu2019t let it deter you from getting a sample or buying the product (unless youu2019re sensitive to that stuff)  2) it definitely does tingle a bit, but itu2019s not bothersome. I kinda like the feeling, itu2019s cooling but it also feels like itu2019s working. You also get more used to it as you leave it on.   I used it for 3 days in a row like the package said, and the morning after the second use I noticed some bumps and things popping up especially around my nose, where I tend to breakout if Iu2019m going to get a breakout. It wasnu2019t crazy breaking me out, but it is supposed to clarify so a few things popping up as your skin adjusts itself should be expected. I really do like this mask. It comes off easily and I think it will be good for keeping my occasional cystic acne breakouts and clogged pores/white heads at bay. I think if your skin is really congested and acne prone, you should get a few samples in store and try it out, but I think youu2019d really like it:)"

It's easier in the shower. I use it as a spot mask for occasional pimples, about 20 minutes. Inflammation is generally reduced by 30% right away, more if I follow it with their Lapis oil. The combo takes inflammation down by at least 70% the next morning. My teen daughter loves it, too, and she's experiencing some forehead acne. It's the only mask that clarifies and reduces redness without any side effects. For her, using it several times a week gets the best results."

It's not a miracle product, it's just better than a clay mask (which literally anything is), but nevertheless was something that worked well and I obviously liked enough to repurchase several times. Now I am all but certain the formula has changed and that they are skimping on blue tansy oil - this mask stains my skin blue, and it's so difficult to remove the stain that I suspect some kind of dye (even if natural) is being used to make it appear to be more potent with blue tansy than it really is. Just from spreading the mask on my face, it immediately stained my fingers blue. My face is stained blue, didn't wash off with cleanser and toner, and took until the next day to gradually fade. Really disappointed."

My skin has also gotten extremely sensitive and my favorite face product actual gave me a chemical burn so I was incredibly nervous to try this. I also am a regular full face girl as well. I wash morning and night and moisturize regularly as well.  Hereu2019s my personal experience:  Night 1: my face was still incredibly flakey from getting a chemical burn and I was also in a lot of pain. I put this mask on for thirteen minutes in total. In the morning my face had barely any dry skin on it at all, essentially my face was reset to itu2019s normal oily, acne prone self and also glowing (Iu2019m not talking pregnancy glow either) which was a whole lot comfier than the burn I had. The redness and irritation from my acne and burn had died down not completely but almost there.   Night 2: I left this make on for roughly twenty minutes. The next morning; my cysts were noticeably smaller while small bits of acne and acne that had been picked at were gone. The redness of my acne was still there in the slightest bit but the glow of my skin kinda of cancelled that out.   Night 3: accidentally left this on for thirty minutes; my skin felt absolutely amazing the next morning. So soft. Acne was also almost completely gone, cysts were still there but so much smaller and much more comfortable in my own skin. I was bragging about my skin on Snapchat which I never ever have done before. The redness had also completely gone away so really all I was left with was glow and these skin toned bumps on my chin.   Night 4; it was well over thirty minutes (I got distracted on Netflix) so I was incredibly nervous about the next morning. THE NEXT MORNING MY FACE WAS CLEARED!!! So soft and luscious looking honestly. So many compliments too. Loved all of it.   I use roughly every other day now, Iu2019m in love!!"

Let dry for 10-20 minutes (the longer the better) and the feeling goes from tingly and sometimes stingy (not painful) to feeling very dry and stiff.  Results are amazing- my skin feels so much softer, looks brighter and glows from within.  I use it about twice per week and will continue to do so until I run out.

I'll finish up four in a row and then probably use it every 2-3 nights as needed. The smell is a little strong at first, but I got used to it quickly, and the results are well worth it for me.

I was still getting breakouts in my late twenties and my dermatologist said that after the teen years it's usually caused by buildup on the skin and that non-physical exfoliation is super important.

Lovely blue color, consistency somewhere between gel and liquid so it spreads easily. Only downsides are that the smell is very strong. It's not entirely unpleasant, I don't know how to describe it. Like fruit and perfumed soap almost. The scent lingers for a while even after rinsing it off very thoroughly. I am not a fan of strong scents so this isn't great for me personally. And it is a steep price. The container is of a decent size though and a small thin layer goes a long way so I anticipate it will last for a good amount of time. Definitrly needs to be followed up with a light moisturizer after use. I've tried a few other exfoliation type masks and this is the one I will re purchase."

However, I went back on the Sephora website to check the ingredients and noticed that the recommendation on the site said 15-20 minutes. I decided to try that and it made such a difference. My face was glowing right after and a lot of people have even commented that my skin was just glowing. I love it and I use it as my go-to before any special events to guarantee glowing skin.  Only docking a star because the instructed timing made the difference for me!"

I think it makes my skin more dewy but that is it so far. I will update if anything significant changes. Due to the consistency and how far it spreads.. this container is going to last a long time."

The smell is not that bad, but does have a slight medicinal quality to it.

By stubborn I mean no face wash, peel off mask, pore strip or any other mask has been able to make a difference. Blue tansy has made a huge impact. My pores look tighter, and the amount of black heads on my nose has been reduced significantly. My chin is in better shape too and I am so happy. A little goes a very long way with this so its worth the price tag. I've caught my boyfriend dipping into this as well now.

I say actually because Iu2019ve never had a mask do anything before. This one managed to unclog pores the first use! You can feel a slight tingling and your skin gets very tight as it does itu2019s thing. I used an extractor after 20 minutes of the mask and I was amazed at what I could get out.

After much research I decided this was my mask to attempt next. Something I can use once  or twice a week with my normal night time regimen. I have combo skin, cystic acne, and  texture issues. The consistency of the mask had me skeptical... Its gel like and thin and goopy. Bizarre. A little goes a long way though so it will last me at least 9 months. But, it stays on well while I get ready for bed and I can feel it working! I've never used a mask that I saw and felt immediate results until this little number. The little bumps on my cheeks and forehead were gone the second I rinsed it off, my entire face actually felt clean, pores are tight, and ready for my toner,  serum, night cream routine (clinique smart line). It was super easy to rinse unlike many mud or peeling masks. I am using it again right now, 2nd time this week, and have no doubts.  The ONLY reason this got 4 stars was because the smell is RANCID. I know some people will return a mask over a smell, that's not me- It works so well that if it was dog doo doo in a jar, I would still keep using it. It has a pine tree, christmasy, medicine, sap smell but does not last once its washed off. So, I'll happily take the 20 minute hit.  Do yourself a favor... if you have: Acne Bumps Texture Issues Scarring Clogged Pores Black Heads ANYTHING ELSE..."

Luckily, I bought the Sephora mask applicator in the same order so I used it to apply the mask. I would recommend purchasing the applicator with the mask because if I had used my hands, I think I would have unnecessarily wasted a lot of product. With that being said, you only need a thin layer of the mask for it to do it's job so I think the jar will last awhile because the consistency is thin.

I do feel tingling with use but it goes away. My skin is SO clear and is literally glowing everyday. It also feels BABY soft. My nose seems clearer and less congested too.

I washed it off and followed up with my regular night time skin care routine. Let me tell you... a good night's sleep later, I wake up in the morning and the congestion is GONE. Not only is the congestion gone but the pimple on my chin SHRUNK and BECAME FLAT and was NO LONGER RED.

I like to use it in the evening and follow with an oil, the herbivore ones in combination with this mask feels like I have a new face."

All redness, acne scars, dark spots, and cystic pimples are virtually gone within the first three weeks of use. I have some tiny pimples under the skin that never really do anything, and this mask has helped to start clear those up. It has also started to clear up the black heads from my chin and nose. Physical exfoliants make my acne flare up and irritate my skin, so this mask is the perfect alternative to get rid of all the irritation, damage, and congestion.  I have normal, acne prone skin. My skin can tend to be a little sensitive or dry so I have to be careful not to use harsh products. This mask has been absolutely perfect for me. It's important to me to use products that don't have harmful ingredients and I love how clean this mask is while still being effective.   When I first got this mask, I used it for four nights in a row. After the first four days, I started using the mask 3 times a week and I haven't looked back. I use it at night and it leaves me with an amazing refreshed glow. I did not experience any tingly or stinging with this mask, maybe a very very slight sensation if I really paid attention.   The smell is quite lovely! It smells strong when its in the jar and while you're applying it, but once it's on your face you don't notice the smell at all. It is a fruity and herby smell. So thankful there is no synthetic fragrance!  The packaging is beautiful and the jar is super chic. It comes with a little plastic spatula to retrieve and apply the product with. The mask is a little bit runny when you're scooping it out of the jar to your face, but if you just put a little bit on your spatula and quickly apply it to your face it doesn't run or drip.  Honestly, there is nothing bad about this product, no cons. If I could only use one skin care product, the Blue Tansy mask would be it."

I also have some redness and a few small scars.  Iu2019ve used lots of the hottest masks out there: Fresh, Origins, GlamGlow; and they all failed to do anything to my acne or made it even worse.  This is different.  It isnu2019t gimmicky, itu2019s not too overly drying, and itu2019s not irritating.  This product comes in very cute simplistic packaging and a little goes a LONG way; this mask will last me almost a year by how little you need for your whole face.  With two weeks of treatment as directed, these little tiny bumps all on my face and nose are heavily fading away! I occasionally get some bad hormonal almost cyst like acne too, and this mask calms it down from being so red, and it makes them disappear twice as fast and they appear two times smaller when they pop up.  I can easily see this mask eventually making that acne and my scars disappear forever with continued use.  My pores looks so much cleaner and theyu2019re actually getting cleaned out with this mask without striping my face of its natural oils.  (I have oily skin and if it gets stripped, it overproduces oil the next day so itu2019s important for me not to get stripped).  This mask does have a strong smell in its jar, but when itu2019s applied to the face itu2019s not nearly as strong as in the jar (but still stronger than Iu2019d like but it isnu2019t irritating to my skin).  My skin doesnu2019t get sensitive from this mask and it doesnu2019t get too dry either from it.  It feels very refreshing while wearing it, and there were no tingles for me.  I suggest using a cloth to help wash it off to really make sure youu2019re taking off all the residue since itu2019s clear and it dries onto your skin.  If lots of other masks have failed you, I URGE you to give this one a try! It was the final key to my perfect skin care routine and I hope itu2019s the key to yours too!"

This really works. If you think you might benefit from a little bit of a 'peel' sort of thing, try this first. Even with sensitive skin, I don't get that horrible burning feeling that a lot of 'resurfacing' products give me. At the same time, it seriously works. Put on a thin layer, let it stay on until it dries, and then take it off with a wet cloth. Follow it with something moisturizing if you are dry."

Although, I used a few other products to help clear up my skin I think this really helped make my face become smoother, softer, brighter, & hydrated & it helped with some of those pimples. It helped with some new scarring from the pimples as well. It does tingle a little but overall it's been a MUST for my skincare & now I know why I used to use it a lot."

It faded my old, persistent acne scars and kept my skin clean and clear. HOWEVER, BLUE TANSY IS BETTER??!! I have been using this for only a week and there is a drastic difference in my skin. The acne scars I have had for years and did not respond to any other treatment have significantly faded. My skin is oily and acne prone, and this has really cleared up my skin.  This may not be how the product is advertised, but I have worn the mask to bed and it is really miraculous. The mask is all natural, and it works so well overnight, so why not! When I wake up, my skin is so so soft, clean, and clear! I think this treats my acne in addition to fading scars, whereas the Tata Harper Resurfacing Mask only faded my scars, and was a little drying. Pimples and redness are reduced, and my skin looks more smooth and even. This is moisturizing, but good for oily skin and acne, has reduced my breakouts and oiliness, and has seriously faded my persistent redness and acne scars. Honestly this stuff is Heaven sent."

This mask came to the rescue.   I followed the package, masking three days in a row and then reducing to a couple times a week. The morning after my first use, my acne was visibly less inflamed and my red marks had already faded. This mask boosts your skin in a lot of ways because it literally resurfaces it and speeds up the process by which your skin regenerates using natural enzymes. After using it, my serums such as niacinamide and alpha arbutin gave me visible results again. Itu2019s good to note that immediately after taking the mask off I didnu2019t notice as much of a change as when I woke up the next morning and as the days progressed.   + a tip: a little bit goes a long way!! You only need enough for a thin layer on your face. Itu2019s quite a liquidy consistency so it spreads very well and the jar will last a long time as long as you donu2019t overdo it.

I was desperate and started trying everything under the sun! I came across this product and after reading the reviews decided to try it. It is by far the BEST mask I have ever used! My skin feels delicious, but more importantly, my acne has dramatically decreased and even new pimples are not as painful.  I actually felt like my skin was on fire the last few months and was insanely inflamed, after using this for a few days, that all went away! I HIGHLY recommend this product, it is truly a MIRACLE!!!"

Blue Tansy leaves my skin feeling soft, helping to regulate my oil production in a way that doesnt leave my skin dry or sensitive. In fact, this product is so gentle I have been able to use it on a nightly basis, with maybe one or two rest days; mind you, I am no stranger to acids! This instantly soothes inflamed skin and reduces redness to a significant degree, and the same goes for blemishes and scarring. The texture of my skin had evened out after 3 nights of use, and my complextion was like glass. It honestly does it all, and I could not recommend this product enough. I would say this would even be a great introduction product to acids, and in terms of my current love affair - the only aha/bha product worth using. Honestly, I am so addicted my other acid masks are collecting dust. Definitely will repurchase, again and again."

I just stumbled upon it and decided to give it a shot not really having high hopes because nothing else has worked for me.

I used this about 4 times the second week after I was done with birth control and saw a HUUUGEEE difference. My acne isnu2019t 100% gone (thatu2019s only was dreams are made of) and i still have some scarring but my skin is honestly 90% better than it was.

The texture of my skin evened out drastically, the dark marks have been fading nicely, overall my complexion is clearer. I highly recommend this product, it sounds pricey, but using a silicone mask applicator, a little goes a long way. I would totally repurchase this again."

I bought it bc I was looking for something to help with my redness and I heard this was great. My redness has def reduced since using it, along with some other products from Kiehls. My only tips would be to apply conservatively- you only need a thin layer and the stuff goes by quicker than you think. And to leave it on for a few extra minutes and let it dry a little more.

My deep blackheads that wouldn't come out with just an AHA toner are no longer black and are up and sticking out of my skin, nearly ready to be extracted. I now pair this with Ole Henriksons oil control cleanser (smells very fresh) and Drunken Elephants TLC AHA/BHA night serum and in 3 days, they went from being barely visible (but there), super deep blackheads, to mostly closed skin-colored bumps on top of my skin now. I really neglected my skin before figuring this out and this is really helping purge everything and new acne breakouts are to a minimum. I don't feel a burn, barely a tingle on some days, and you use so very little to cover your face you get a lot for the price. Be sure to shake well before using, every time. PS. I don't wear foundation make up, ever, so I don't can't help you there. I also got this as a sample before I bought the big one and used it twice and THAT was what made up my mind.

I followed the instructions, using 4 days in a row and by day 3 I already saw the difference of my pores being minimized and my skin feeling so much softer. I had really bumpy (whiteheads) and acne prone skin and this has truly reduced it. It hasn't completely cleared it, but I'm still using it every second day. The smell is pretty off-putting when you put it on, and there's a burning sensation which is pretty uncomfortable as you apply it but goes away after it sits on your face for about 10 seconds.

I was pleasantly surprised when I rinsed this off after first use to find that my skin was not angry - it looked pretty regular, so I was pumped to continue use the next night (they recommend 3-4 nights in a row initially, then reduce to a few times per week).  When I woke up in the morning, my redness appeared to have lessened just the slightest bit.  After the second use, however, my face was CHANGED.  I couldnu2019t believe when I looked in the mirror.  My rosacea bumps on my cheeks were still there, and still red, but the majority of the skin around the bumps was no longer red.

If you're at the end of your rope trying to deal with enlarged, clogged pores in your T-zone, this is your miracle cure!!"

Here are the pros and cons that I gathered after using it 1-3 times a week for the last 3 months:   PROS:  I know some find the scent unpleasant, but I don't mind it and actually grown to like it. The scent is a cross between Listerine and some sort of citrus fruit? I don't know it's distinctive.  I have extremely acne prone skin that gets easily inflamed and red (especially around the mouth and nose) and this didn't cause me redness or excessive tingling (there is some tingle when I first apply it then it's a cooling sensation).  This mask doesn't harden and crack on your face so you don't get that strong drying and tugging effect. I liked that.  Because of the feature above, the mask is relatively easy to rinse off. You don't have to scrub your face like crazy. And finally for the effect that I bought it for...this mask does soften my skin, but didn't seem to loosen the gunk that stays in my pores on my nose. Lasts forever and doesn't seem to dry out like the clay based masks.  CONS:  For whatever reason, even though it may feel as though I rinsed the mask off I'm often left with a grayish-blue cast on my skin. This is why I use it only at night. The effect is gone by morning.  The soften effects of the skin does not last long on me. My rough patches are back the next morning..."

This morning, I put my foundation on and the difference was amazing. My spots are all pink and flat, where 3 days ago they were bright angry red with tons of dead skin.  A little bit goes a long way. I can see myself getting a couple dozen uses out of this at least. Also, with regards to the smell... I adore it! Iu2019m not a huge perfume fan so I can appreciate a nice natural floral smell.

Getting past the scent issues, I did have a strong burn feeling when I initially dripped some onto my face; this might be because I might actually have sensitive skin despite thinking that I don't have much skin sensitivity when using products. With continuous use the initial burning feeling should reduce in severity is what most say. I am hoping to use this continuously to see some results as acne and redness are some of my biggest issues.

I feel like this masks helps with all of this. The masku2019s smell reminds me slightly of Vicku2019s Vaporub, but on the more spa-like/essential oil side. The mask is a clear blue-ish green that you just spread on your skin like jelly. It has a cooling effect and dries into a clear shiny and smooth texture. I use my Clarisonic to speed up the process of washing it off, because with only warm water and your hands, you basically have to wait for it to melt off in the water a little at a time. Immediately after using, my skin is so calm, even-toned, & glowy. With regular use my skin becomes clear, balanced, and healthy looking. I notice a difference when I donu2019t use it. The instructions recommend using a few days in a row when you first purchase and then backing off after that. The product does change color over time - from blue to green. The company says this is because the ingredients are natural, but the change in color does not affect the integrity of the product. Iu2019ve had my jar for months and it has turned more green, but works just as well as ever. I would definitely recommend giving this mask a shot!"

I had really bad acne in high school, then in my early 20s it got much better (wasnu2019t completely gone though), and recently my skin has been freaking out on me, but this mask helps a LOT.

I decided to purchase this mask based on the over 700 reviews and that over 540 of them are 5 star reviews. I have normal skin when it comes to acne. However, I do get hormonal cyst, which are definitely my main skin care concern. I tend to get these cysts in my t zone area, especially on my chin and the only thing that seems to be effective is getting in injected by my dermatologist. These constant reoccurring hormonal cyst have raised my concern for scaring and texture. I got this mask recently and have used it 3 times. I know that's not a ton of time using it but I have noticed just in 3 uses that it has cleared up most of those stubborn blackheads on my noise and the t zone around my noise. It has helped to reduce texture from previous cysts as well on my chin. When I first applied the blue tansy mask it did sting and I did experience a burning sensation but haven't used AHA's and BHA's in awhile. I'm assuming it was from that. The second use I didn't experience any burning sensation. You do have a slight stinging sensation, which is more of a tingling sensation. This mask doesn't smell the best from it being natural ingredients. The smells not bad enough to make me not want to use it and you get used to it. Definitely will continue to use this! It seems to be effective and doing what the product claims to!"

This product stands out from other resurfacing masks in that it is effective with consistent use and has natural ingredients without all the unnecessary chemicals.

I will say I used the mask alone many times and felt that my skin looked clearer, smaller pores and redness was not as prominent. But as life goes you only remember the most recent experiences and for the past two weeks I have used both products in conjunction and know that one of them is causing small pustule type pimples instead of the cystic acne I would rarely but mostly suffer from. And when one goes away another pops up along side it. I honestly think itu2019s the oil but from the ingredient list one would not think the oil would cause breakouts. I have been one of those rare people who can have adverse or breakout reactions from salicylic acid. Not all of them though maybe just the stronger types. I would say if that is you as well maybe use this mask once a week.  I enjoy the smell of the mask but it is strong . It revives your senses. If you like essential oil scents you shouldnu2019t have an issue with the smell. I still give this 4 stars because I am on my third jar of this stuff and I have been using this so long that I feel I do like this product and just made the mistake of using the oil.

After hearing such great things, I was a little disappointed and a little skeptical. Then about 2 weeks into using it, I broke out with some hormonal cystic acne. I used this mask in tandem with the Ordinary's salicylic acid treatment and it was the fastest I've ever seen a cyst disappear. I was lucky enough (trying to see the silver lining here) to break out with another cyst the following week, and rather than using my blue tansy/ordinary combo, I used Glossier's Solution and it did Nothing to clear my cyst. It felt like it was just sitting there on my face-- no improvement whatsoever until I gave in and tried my blue tansy/ordinary combo one night. The next morning I woke up and it looked so much better. Not gone, by any means, but vastly improved, smaller in size, and less red. In general I find that it gives me a nice glow and makes my skin feel soft.  I'm sold. Will definitely repurchase."

Gave my skin a cooling sensation while it was on. 3. Calmed my skin (reduced redness, breakouts were slightly less irritated and did not dry out my skin). The only downside I see is that since this mask is pretty much all natural it does tend to expire quite quickly. I will say it does start turning a sort of greenish color after a few weeks upon opening. I am not sure if that is just because it is exposed to oxygen or what. However, I have continued to use it and it works just the same. Just something to keep in mind. Also since it does not last as long as other face masks that are not all natural, it is quite pricey in my opinion. I wish they would sell a mini sized."

This mask has the ingredients and they do wonders for my face.  I get pretty regular peels, so the fact that a mask can do as much or more than actual acid being applied to the skin immediately, with not much tingle is pretty awesome.  This mask doesnu2019t just help with clarity, no matter how bad the breakout is...It makes my skin tighter and my pores are no longer visible.  I also still have texture left, and itu2019s reducing that to darn near nothing.  I look like I went to the spa and paid hundreds every time.  Iu2019d def pick up a sample at the store if you are hesitant, a little goes a long way.  When I use it, I steam my fave after a shower which isnu2019t necessary but you can pick up a steamer on amazon for $15-$20.  It does help get the nasty out of pores.  I leave it on a few mins longer than they say and rinse it with a warm towel.  Oily?  Texture?  Pores?  Acne?I wish I had found this mask sooner...Holygrail as a MF."

I did not take issue with the smell, but I saw absolutely no difference in my skin.  No noticeable improvement in texture or clarity whatsoever.  I realize that you have to allow time to see the full effects of beauty products, but I absolutely expect to see refreshed,  brightened or smoothed skin immediately with a mask that is as expensive as this.  I've paid less for masks that were far more effective.  I don't mind paying for quality products that work, but this fell short. It applies and dries like a gel with no discernible sensation to indicate that it's activating (e.g. cooling, tingling, tightening).  I admire the philosophy of Herbivore and I am pleased with the lapis oil so far, but this mask was a disappointment for me.  I will be returning."

And majority of acne or skin clarifying products has this ingredient. So i got introduced to This Blue Tansy Natural face Clarifying and the lapis oil and i live it !

I trust the brand so much after trying this I immediately purchased another one of their masks.   The smell is a unique one but I grow to like it more every time I use it.   I love that it comes with a little spatula so I can stir the product and apply it without having to put my fingers in the jar. It is very liquidy so be careful when you open it not to spill (I did whoops)  The blue is quite strong so be careful when applying it to not get it on things.

Iu2019m using a skin care regime that is making my skin very happy but is doing nothing to get rid of those clogged pores. Clay masks just dry out my skin, so they arenu2019t an option for me. When I told the skin care specialist at Sephora about my needs and skin type, she immediately recommendef the Blue Tansy mask by Herbivore.   So far, I have used it 5 times. The first 2 times I used it, I forgot to stir it up. As a result, it didnu2019t work all that well. But I was amazed at how well it worked after the first time I used it stirred up. Both clusters on my face because noticeably smaller. My skin seems to get better with each subsequent use. I canu2019t wait to see what my face is going to look like after a month of using this stuff.  People on here have complained about the smell. Iu2019m on the fence about it. Some days I really enjoy the earthy smell. Other days it makes me want to gag. But when a product works this well on your skin and this fast, putting up with the smell is a small price to pay.   I really do recommend that you stir it each time you use the product. The active ingredients settle at the bottom of the jar. If you donu2019t stir, you may not get the full benefits of the mask.   The up front cost is high: $60 CAD. But it lasts a long, long time. I could see this one jar lasting as long as 8 months. And Iu2019d rather pay a little more for a superior mask that works.   Next time youu2019re in Sephora, as the consultant to give you a sample and try it out for yourself. I donu2019t think youu2019ll be sorry."

I am deeply and consistently surprised by the results I get from this mask. My initial impression was the texture and smell, both of which are unique and affirming. I would much rather apply something uniquely-scented to my face than something heavily perfumed. The texture also ensured that I was easily able to apply evenly upon my skin, and it comes with a little spatula to distribute, so that the jar itself is easier to keep hygienic. Now, the results of the product: the effects of the jar stretched much further than I thought they would, and the jar itself lasted quite a while. If used sparingly and not too frequently, a jar could last you several months. The hydroxy acids also ensure that you are getting a deep resurfacing of old, dead skin cells. The AHA, water soluble and operating primarily upon the surface of the skin, helps to diminish sun-damage and dry skin. Any sort of BHA, works deep in the pores, greatly benefiting those with combination, oily, and acne-prone skin. I think Herbivore has formulated a splendid combination of the two, and added just enough soothing ingredients (Blue Tansyu2019s calming and anti-inflammatory benefits, yay!) to greatly diminish most, if not all, negative side effects from the more intensive ingredients within the line. Thanks for the clear and radiant skin, Herbivore!"

The results I find are limited and aren't really apparently unless you use this mask often (as suggested).  If you can afford it, go for it.

I love that It does not dry out your face like other masks do. If your thinking of buying this mask just do it!

I had fairly clear skin for most of my teen years and I followed a strict skincare regimen to make sure it stayed that way.  This past year has been filled with stress and lots of change in my life and my habits (including going off birth control) and I found that my normal skincare routine just wasnu2019t working anymore.  Over the past year my forehead has slowly turned into a bumpy mess with visibly clogged pores and angry red breakouts at my temples.  My nose developed lots of blackheads and my chin was always bumpy and breaking out.  I tried all different types of masks and washes and creams.  I tried benzoyl peroxide, salicylic acid, and a whole bunch of natural u201cmiracle curesu201d that either made my skin worse or did nothing at all.   I bought this mask as an early birthday present to myself and started using it the other day.  Iu2019ve used it nightly for 3 nights now and my skin has improved drastically.  Almost all the tiny bumps on my forehead are gone.  The inflamed pimples on my temples have been reduced to light pink spots.  The breakouts on my chin are healing well and even the large cystic lump I had between my eyebrows shrunk to half its original size.  Iu2019m blown away by these results and canu2019t wait to see how my skin improves over the next few weeks as I continue using this mask. As for the product itself, a little seems to go a very long way and is definitely worth the money.  The spatula it comes with is very handy for scooping out the product and ensuring the jar isnu2019t contaminated.  Thereu2019s a noticeable tingle when the product is applied, but it never feels painful (my skin is fairly sensitive and other AHA/BHA products have left me red and burning).  The scent is very strong, but not unpleasant.  I think it smells like those chalky flintstones vitamins.  Overall a wonderful product."

Fast forward a few weeks and a sales associate at Sephora advises that I try this, and because I own it already, I do.  Oh. My. God. It's fantastic. I've never tried a product that transformed my skin so quickly. If you have qualms about this scent, let me urge you: try it anyway! The scent isn't as noticeable as you think (honestly!) and it's beyond worth it. The instructions say to use 2-3 times a week, and I have to stop myself from using it every day--it's that good. My skin is feels smooth and clear. I'll absolutely purchase the full-size once I've finished the sample, and check out the rest of Herbivore's products while I'm at it. I cannot recommend this enough, and coming from someone who fully expected to throw her sample away, that means something."

Hoping it would help, I applied the mask and let it set for about 20m until it was taut, then rinsed it off. I found that my pimple was practically gone! 20m. Amazing.  I originally received a trial size in the Sephora Play bag, but I'll be purchasing the full size just for how well it works on pimples."

This is an AHA and BHA product, so I was expecting some mild stinging, but the product only felt very cooling on my skin. It was for this reason that I didn't think the mask was actually working for me. I have using chemical exfoliants for years now, and they're usually 8% glycolic acid or 2% salicylic acid. The Blue Tansy mask performed sooo much better than any of my other exfoliants. After one use, congested pores were cleared, blemishes were less swollen, and my skin was smoooooth! I used an oil cleanser after the mask to get all the grits out of my pores and it really kicked things up a notch."

I bought this about a month and a half ago and have been using it around 3x/ week in the evening, leaving it on for 30 minutes or so. Afterwards, I gently exfoliate with a kelp-and-sea-salt-based face wash and a konjac sponge, and the dryness and peeling that I tend to experience around this time (hello, autumn!) is nearly gone. I also really like the fact that, unlike many of my previous go-to's, Blue Tansy does not burn or tingle at all. Together with the sponge exfoliation, it gives a nice glow the morning after use, and it has helped reduce the hormone-induced breakouts that I tend to get. The pot is also quite large, and even though I use a nice thick layer of this masque when I apply it, it looks like it will last about 6 months. Highly recommend!"

I couldn't leave the house without foundation!! I tried the ordinary serums, about every clay and sulphur and charcoal mask on the market (no budget for skin care am I right!!) and everything just seemed to irritate my sensitive skin and make my blemishes worse. I even tried the Tata Harper clarifying mask, which was much too harsh for skin, leaving me red and sore. I tried this mask on a whim when chatting with a sephora worker about my skin. THIS MASK CHANGED MY LIFE!!!!!! After 1 week it has brought to head blackheads and blemishes that were deep in my skin, which I extracted. My skin after using looks fresh and even toned, and this does not irritate at all. It does tingle a bit upon application, and the scent definitely takes getting used to. I use a Mac brush to apply this so I get a nice even thin layer and don't dip my fingers into the product. This is the best!! I just ordered a bunch of herbivore products because this made such a good impression"

The smell is pungent and it has a slight tingle but neither of which would stand in my way of repurchasing.

Scent - absolutely gorgeous. Instantly relaxing. 2. Colour - dreamy, relaxing - everything you want in a mask before bedtime. 3. Miracles - I put it on my peeling, red face - a little tingle sensation and then it calms. When I washed it off, redness was almost instantly gone.

I've tried a MILLION masks and this is definitely in my top 3 because of how instant the results are. My redness was almost completely gone, my skin felt super smooth, some little bumps I had on my cheeks were GONE, most of my dark marks/scars had significantly lightened, it didn't dry out my skin at all, and best of all my complexion just looked brighter! Another thing that I love about this is how little of the product you have to use! The jar should last me more than a few months if I use it 1-2 times a week, which is well worth the $48 to me, especially because of the almost instant results.

Truthfully it was such a complete waste and did not even feel luxe when using"

I have very oily skin, and while I was not prone to major breakouts, I did get occasional pimples, and I had large pores/A TON OF BLACKHEADS. Like everywhere, all over my face. So I found Herbivore and was drawn to the beautiful packaging... then I read the reviews and immediately had to try some of their products. So I bought the charcoal soap, blue tansy mask, rose spray, and the lapis oil. THE BLUE TANSY MASK HAS CHANGED MY SKIN. I don't even wear makeup anymore... I hardly have any blackheads. My pores are way less visible. My skin is SO SOFT. Like I find myself touching my face all of the time because it's so soft... I also have had several people tell me my skin looks perfect and ask about my skincare routine...  I really can't believe the results. It's amazing."

The product is pricy, but it lasted me a year!!! In the beginning I followed its instructions, but after my skin was smooth and glowing I decided to only use it when my skin would breakout.

It somehow manages to keep the dry parts of my face hydrated (like my chin) and the oily parts of my face in control (literally everywhere else). I haven't broken out at all, and my acne scars appear fainter. I even went on a trip abroad without this for 2 weeks and my skin maintained its look and feel!  I will continue to buy this as long as it exists. It's made me more confident in my natural skin than ever before. Also, I recommended this to a friend (with dry, flaky skin), and she was shocked at how quickly her skin became soft and supple."

I had quite a few scars from previous breakouts on my face and nothing would get rid of them. On a whim I decided to try this mask and I'm glad I did! The instructions suggest you apply a thin layer daily for 3-4 days straight, then use 2-3 times a week. After the first use, my scars faded dramatically and my skin has calmed down from new breakouts. I've been using the mask for about a month now. A little goes a long way, I apply a thin layer 2 times a week as well as a spot treatment for new breakouts and I barley made a dent in the jar. Now my scars are almost completely gone. I really wish I had of taken before and after pictures.  The mask tingles a little for the first few minutes (which I oddly like) but after it drys there is no tingle sensation. After the mask is removed, your face has an amazing healthy glow and feels so soft!  It is quite expensive but worth every penny. I will definitely be repurchasing and recommending to everyone."

I didn't take the mask off however, the stinging went away quickly and left me with a cooling tightening sensation. Has not stung or burned since. Been using for about 2.5 weeks. My acne scars are fading and my acne has calmed down so much. This makes my skin feel so clean and refreshed. Says what it does. I LOVE THAT. Will repurchase."

Although I do have a few scars left, my skin texture is pretty much smooth besides the occasional small pimple--even my friends have noticed and complimented me on the outcome!  My skin isn't very sensitive so I am able to leave it on for about 20 minutes each time I use it. I followed the instructions on the box; use 3-5 nights in a row and then use 1-2 times a week after. If you leave it on for too long it will dry out your skin, so make sure to keep track of the time or go by how your skin is feeling with the mask on. I make sure not to overuse it in order to avoid over exfoliating my skin which could result in more acne.  The downside on this product that I could see being a deal breaker for many people is the smell. The only way I can describe it is it being similar to Asian medicinal herbs that my grandmother always used. However, the nose will eventually get used to the smell when it is on your face so it shouldn't be a huge problem.  The product applies smoothly and it does not take a lot to spread around, as you only need a thin layer and it spreads easily. Washing it off is very simple as well; I recommend a wet wash cloth in the beginning to ensure the product is fully washed off.   Overall, my skin has been brighter, smoother and less irritated by unwanted acne ever since I have been using this product. Any dryness that occurs is easily fixed with some serums, moisturizer and Aquaphor!"

Pros: -your skin feels as soft as a baby's whenever you use this mask -a little goes a long way  -does a great job of decongestant skin and working with redness  Cons: -the first time you use it you have to use it for 5 days straight and then 1-2x a week after so despite a little going a long way you have to use it frequently -didn't really do too much for my pores, was more of a resurfacing mask than anything.  So bottom line is: if you're looking for softer, smoother skin that's been resurfaced and will better absorb products than this is for you. If you're looking for some sort of pore miracle than I would recommend you try something else instead. I'm still repurchasing though because my skin looks great!"

I try to use it once a week but I will use it several days in a row to clear up any bumps/trouble spots. I always keep it on for at least 20 minutes and it never irritates my sensitive skin.

One con though... super hard to rinse off after leaving on for 20ish minutes. There is a thin layer of filmy material that I have to wash off for a good 2 minutes to get off."

I used to stop all my products during that week and just use cleanser to make sure my skin's clean. (it stings!!)  It used to be a hopeless case but when I got into the the skin step regimen of Koreans, I learned so much and my friend introduced me to this product and said it's worth the hype. At first I was iffy because of the price since I didn't want to disappoint and worsen my skin as I already gave up on this a long time ago..  However, I read articles about blue tansy being high in azulene that's good for inflammations ++ and so I gave it a shot and can i just saw it was worth EVERY DOLLAR!  The smell overwhelmed me at first, but when I got used to it.. It's all good now. But wow, THIS IS A LIFE SAVER!!!  4 straight days of using (together with Foam Cleanser,Toner,Essence, Oil Treatments & Creams aka my normal regimen that I used to stop during the time of the month) and my irritated/itchy skin is as smooth as baby skin!!   It goes well with the Ordinary's Niacinamide serum too! My blemishes and redness subsided SO FAST!"

They also smell good. Tata Harper burned my face. SKII is fantastic. I also tried some more. But Herbivore Blue Tansy is my favorite. It smells incredible, minty and herbal, very aromatherapeutic. The mask makes my pores look smaller, skin look refreshed, without burning the way Tata Harper mask did. I imagine that if you don't love the fragrance you won't love this mask as the smell is very strong, but if you're like me you'll appreciate the smell and how well this masks work, even on older skin.

I used it for about a week. Needless to say I was annoyed and wasn't expecting much due to the mixed reviews here. I tried this mask last night for 20 minutes. I applied with a clean flat foundation brush in a thin layer and experienced some mild tingling, it easily came off with warm water and a damp wash cloth, the scent is medicinal, but nothing cloying. I followed with my serum and moisturizer. This morning I didn't experience a WOW factor, but when I did my makeup later in the day I actually was like WOW. GG left my skin parched and flakey. Today my skin is hydrated and smooth. My makeup felt like it glided on my skin. (After my usual morning routine of serum, moisturizer, primer and SPF) Before this mask it took forever to make my foundation look smooth and natural. Which is why I set off find something to help and ended up in a GG nightmare! I will take gentle and hydrating any day. BTW I have normal to dry, sensitive, acne prone skin. I'm no spring chicken either-- mid forties. I will continue to use this as directed. Happy masking!"

So, for the price tag and the gimmicky claims, this face mask is a rip off. The smell doesn't bother me all that much, but cleaning it off is like cleaning off a slippery slime. And I can't even say that my skin feels softer afterwards. I will be using it up because I paid $48 for it, but honestly, every time I put it on my face I feel like I'm wasting my time."

I always have acne scars (and some pretty serious ones on my cheeks right now) and little random blemishes all over that just don't give me an even complexion.

My skin tone already looks more even, I haven't broken out again since using it, my acne scars are lightening, and my face altogether just looks brighter and more hydrated, I don't even have to use as much concealer as I used to. I can't say enough about how amazing the Blue Tansy mask is. And like it couldn't get good enough, the stuff lasts quite a long time, it barely takes any to adequately coat your face.

I am a mask junkie, especially when the ingredients are all pure and natural so I knew I had to try this mask! I have been using it every day for three days since I got it and WOW. My skin has never felt smoother! I have also been wearing makeup during the day every day and usually this irritates my skin and causes me to get all bumpy. I am happy to say that this mask has prevented any breakouts despite continuous wear of makeup. I think my dark spots may be getting lighter too, but its hard to say. The mask smells very nice, and a little goes a LONG way. I apply a thin layer as instructed and it doesn't even look like I have used any of the mask yet. Definitely worth the price! Do yourself a favor, and GET IT!"

It's definitely a interesting smell. Kinda hard to describe. It didn't bother me at all as some of the other reviews had me thinking it was going to smell horrendous.  It feels very cooling and tingling. I didn't experience any burning or eye watering.  A little goes a long way.  You put it on for 15-20 mins until it drys. It didn't tighten or crack on my skin. It was a pleasant mask to wear.   My skin looked immediately smoother, firmer and brighter after the first use. The next day I used it again and the result were the same but better. I will continue to use this frequently for another few days then use it once or twice a week.  I didn't notice any issues with peeling or drying out my skin which was one of my concerns that usually happen if I use a AHA or BHA product. Instead my makeup went on smoother and my overall skin looked nice and healthy. I look forward to see the results continue."

This is the only mask I've ever used that when I put it on during a bad breakout, it calms my skin back down. The consistency is a slightly runny gel, which I really like, and a little goes a very long way. As the mask dries, it makes your skin feel tight and after I wash it off, my skin feels nice and firm too.  I use a warm washcloth to rinse it off after and my skin is less red, the bumps are much smaller, and my skin feel super soft. When I wake up the next morning, my skin is glowy and smooth.  This mask has become my go-to for when I'm having a bad breakout or when my skin is tired and looks dull or feels dry and bumpy. I will definitely be repurchasing this and also looking into the other products in this line."

You don't need a lot so the jar will last quite a while, It does come with a spatula for cleaner application.  The slightest tingling and cooling sensation is felt upon first application but quickly fades. I can easily leave it on for an hour with no issues, 15-20mins is recommended. It does not crack or dry out the skin - it does dry down so you can do things around the house while you have it on.  The main ingredient is blue tansy, and that is what it smells like. If you have ever smelled Sunday Riley's Luna oil this smells pretty similar.  I was having some pretty bad breakouts and this was a big stepping stone on helping heal the acne and also resurface any old acne scarring. It's moisturizing but not overkill for my super oily skin.  If you have combo-oily, acne prone and sensitive skin, I would give this a shot. The ingredient deck alone is impressive with no added colors, animal by-products, parabens, flower extracts, etc. The company is cruelty free as well. Highly recommend."

I have extremely sensitive skin and this worked for me . BE CAREFUL IT DOES MAKE YOUR SKIN PURGE. Most products that are cell turnover or renewal masks have AHA and BHA which are known to cause purging. So don't be too worried if you get a few spots after trying this. I was concerned I wouldn't be able to tell if my skin was breaking out or purging from trying it ...the biggest giveaway is the purging will stop within 1-2 weeks usually. It also didn't give me blemishes in places I usually don't which if I was that's a sign of breaking out.

My skin was incredibly soft and literally glowing.   Now for the downsides: the smell is truly awful to me but I don't find it too bad when actually applied to the skin. This mask also didn't do much for the pores on my nose and chin. My cheeks and forehead look amazing but it didn't help with those pore problem areas.  All in all, I think this is a great mask and absolutely worth the money if you love masking and/or are looking for something to even skin tone.

When I first opened the jar and removed the liner disk I got just the tiniest bit on my fingertips and it CLUNG. However. once I actually got to using it on my face, a thin layer reveals that fragrance to be a pretty, pleasant jasmine scent. It's actually quite pretty once you get past the initial surprise.   --Yes, it's blue. This may or may not matter to you, but I think it's a plus! It applies almost fully clear with a slightly blue cast.   --It has a really pleasant cooling sensation when applied. It's surprisingly refreshing, and does leave the impression that it's actively doing something to your skin without any burning.   --I have had adult acne around my jawline on and off for a few years. I've got some scaring from it, and a few spots that were never quite clear even on good days. This mask seems to have drawn those outu2014it's rather remarkable actually. I haven't had it for long, but it works better than anything I've used. I'm using the mask in conjunction with the Herbivore Lapis Oil, which is also great, but the mask is definitely the more active-seeming of the two.  --As other reviewers have noted, the results are indeed temporary--I went away for a couple of weeks after I'd started using it and my skin did regress some. That said, I'm happy to use it on an ongoing basis, it's worth making part of a regimen."

I used it about every night for a week like the directions say, and then 2-3 times a week after that.

I have fairly sensitive skin and it gets red insanely easy and doesn't go away for a while (hot showers, harsh face products, literally being too close to a heater). However, after just the first use of this, I instantly noticed a difference!! It feels a little intense when you first put it on for the first few minutes (slight stinging almost?) so I expected my face to be patchy and red when I washed it off. Instead it was smoother and there was just the faintest tint of red along my cheeks! It was amazing!  After using it for four days my redness has basically gone, and I notice it doesn't show up in my everyday life also!! I definitely notice it seems smoother too and more even. All in all this is fantastic and I can't wait to continue to use it!  May seem a little pricey but you don't have to use much for the thin layer they want and there's a lot packed into it."

My skin is SUPER dry, and I've always had red blotches here and there. I don't struggle with acne, but I get the occasional pimple and my pores also get clogged with white heads.   This is my second night using the mask, and I plan to use it in accordance with the instructions. The container and packaging are really luxurious, which is super nice. The actual product is an interesting blue color, super slimy, so be careful when you open the lid and find its really gooey substance.   The mask goes on clear, and it smells like strong mint. I don't think the smell is unpleasant, but I don't know that it smells great. It's okay, smell-wise. I leave it on 20 minutes, it dries (mostly), and I rinse it off with a pair of exfoliating gloves and warm water.    After using this my skin feels WONDERFUL. It's soft, smooth, cool, and it lasts into the next day. I used a Lancu00f4me toner and moisturizer right after. In the morning, my skin was ready for makeup! And my foundation looks so much better with a smooth surface to work with. I think I found a great product, along with most everyone else.   If you're apprehensive about this product, I'd say give it a try. You might just fall in love."

I still have the occasional face demon, and still have a long career of scars to work out, but at least to me, the difference is so dramatic.

I think I've had my jar for about two months and even at twice-weekly usage, I've still barely made a dent. It has quite an herbal scent and the texture is a very runny, smooth gel that spreads very easily - you get better results, I think, by using a thin layer. It can be a little difficult to wash off (make sure you follow the instructions and use a wet cloth to remove, otherwise you'll be standing over the sink for ages). The first two or so times I used it, it slightly burned my sensitive skin upon application but now it's fine.   Overall, I definitely think this is a good buy for the money. It seems to be lasting me a long time and the results are excellent - just be sure to continue to buy this as you run out, otherwise the results won't last!"

The texture of the mask is light and goes on easily. The applicator they give you sets the perfect amount you need. A little goes a long way and this mask will last months forsure. The smell is pretty and light. I've tried the DDG peels and they did absolutely nothing for me compared to this mask.

            "review_text": "This mask is the only product I would ever call HG. I've purchased it three times (one of those times was because I broke a brand new jar on second use, boy was I mad).   I first got it in the S/S 2016 set. I read all about it and was pretty wary about putting it on my face, but my skin was already a total wreck and couldn't have gotten much worse. Last winter I developed full blown acne patches on my cheeks, which had ALWAYS been clear. This mask cleared that right up. Like, instantly. When those patches developed again this fall, this was the first thing I reached for. My skin is smoother, brighter, and any blemishes I have clear up within days.  I have sensitive skin but use this for 20 minutes. I love that it's gentle enough to be used for consecutive days for instant results. When I'm good about using it for four days as directed, then once a week or so for upkeep, my skin stays radiant and clear. When I get lazy, I like knowing that all I have to do is grab this pretty glass jar.  The scent is pretty strong, but I like it. I love blue tansy. This mask smells a lot like Luna oil, but sweeter and sharper? It's easy to apply and a little goes a long way. Even so, I do find I go through it pretty quickly, but it's totally worth it to me. I follow up with Rose Hibiscus spray and Lapis oil (also from the S/S set and repurchased). My skin has never looked better. I will never go without this again."

I find that it is gentle enough to use multiple times during the week.   My skin's tone and texture has vastly improved making no makeup days a more frequent and less terrifying thing. I'm honestly not sure what I did before I came across this product. Believe the hype and scoop it up when you can!"

I usually use a salicylic acid toner to aid in clearing up my scars, but if I use it too frequently my skin will become dry and peel. Ewh! This mask is PERFECT. It keeps my acne at bay, clears up any scarring rather promptly, and it isn't drying AT ALL. Even more plus sides? There's so much product in here for a not so terrible price. It's also super easy to apply and wash off. I've used Glam Glow's Super Mud, Peter Thomas Roth's Sulfur Mask, Clinique's Even Better Clinical Dark Spot Corrector, Ole Henriksen's Truth Serum, Boscia Exfoliating Peel Gel, Boscia Luminizing Black Mask, Philosophy Clear Days Ahead Pads, and Dr. Dennis Gross' Alpha Beta Extra Strength Peel... Some of these helped, but they're nothing compared to the miracle that is Blue Tansy. How is this product not on the most popular list? It's like a well kept secret. I forget how I came across it and decided to buy it, but good gosh am I glad I did! I apply it as much as I want, sometimes multiple times a day when my skin is in a terrible state and it fixes it up in a jiff without irritating/drying out my skin at all! BUY BUY BUY! But like... don't buy it so much that it sells out the next time I need to refresh my stash. <3"

I actually use this twice a week instead of a cleanser (cleansers really aren't that great for skin just fyi) and my skin always looks so lovely, more even, and less red afterwards, even on my acne-ridden days. The ingredient list is also very easy to love! I've tried Sunday Riley's good genes treatment, and although that worked just as well as this, the ingredients are kinda ehh and the price is also pretty meh.  I recommend putting it on 10-15 min before you shower and just clean it off when you hop in. It's not the easiest to get off your face, but warm water helps. Don't forget to moisturize afterwards! Also I have been using this 2-3 times a week and still have almost the whole jar left- all you need is a thin layer."

To the point where I couldn't even apply concealer or anything because it was just peeling off and extremely patchy. I don't know if the cause is the mask but nothing had changed in my skin care routine otherwise and I am not a dry person what so ever. Also, the smell of this mask is intense and attacks my senses.

It has a distinct and slightly strong smell, but nothing like strong perfume or artifical. While you leave it on, it makes your skin tingle and red. I almost thought it was too strong because my skin is so sensitive, but no. Almost a minute after removing the mask, I already saw results. My face looked less inflamed and less red. When I woke up the next morning, my skin was free from flakes and acne went down tremendously. GET THIS MASK."

My skin has been pretty good for a few years; I don't get breakouts often at all, my skin tone is relatively balanced, but it's on the drier side. This mask has absolutely improved my skin. It's so soft I can't even help but be amazed when I touch my face even days later. The light exfoliation has done wonders to my little flakes of dry skin. Plus my face oils have been soaking in more easily for days after the mask. The price is really quite affordable as I find I need a surprisingly small amount to get the job done.

I leave it on a bit longer than 20 minutes although I'm not sure it makes a difference.   The smell is intense at first, because theres no chemical fragrances added to cover up the natural scents. It quickly fades and becomes almost scent free within the first minute or so.   I also suspect this little glass jar will last me quite sometime. So for the price, well worth it. Overall, the best product I have ever tried."

I have tried so many products and nothing has helped. My skin did not feel dried out after the first week but if I use it more than I need my skin does get quite dry. Grab a sample and try it.

My face was ridden with spots and painful cysts that just weren't going away. I got advice that i was overwashing my face, as i was scrubbing it morning and night with harsh acne cleansers. Well i have soon switched to washing it with a mild organic cleanser at night and in the morning i just wash my face off with water using a konjac sponge. With the addition of this mask to my routine every other night i have definitely noticed a change. Within the first use the risen pimples were gone and the cysts were starting to die down. My dark spots and acne scars are fading with each use and my face is looking more clear and plump. Minimal is definitely the key to my routine and i am loving every bit of it. This will be my ride or die for life!"

(haven't tried that) 3) dont care for the price.   results are there, its a wonderful mask, but its just disappointing in terms of longevity. my acne scars have lessened over time but i also use vitamin c serum and other products, ACTIVE acne goes away faster, and overall complexion is clearer and smoother."

            "review_text": "I want to start off by addressing the complaints about the smell: SKINCARE IS NOT SUPPOSED TO SMELL GOOD!! If it smells like perfume, it's going to be bad for your skin. If you're worried about the smell, it's really NOT unpleasant, just unusual. It smells this way because Herbivore doesn't add any unnecessary fragrances to this, which is a GOOD thing for your skin! Anyway, the smell dissipates a few minutes after applying it. I personally think it smells fine.  I would also like to give props to Herbivore for being cruelty-free, which is amazing. It can be hard to find cruelty-free skincare brands but Herbivore proves that it's possible to make amazing products that don't test on animals.  Now, for the effects of this mask. You feel a slight tingle after your put it on, but it's only minimal. After washing the product off, you can IMMEDIATELY tell that it's made a difference. If you don't know what AHAs and BHAs are, they are chemical exfoliants that deeply clean your skin and help with flakiness and blackheads. The AHAs and BHAs in the mask leave your skin feeling SO smooth and SO soft after using it, and it's not just a temporary effect because this product actually improves your skin over time. With continued use I saw a reduction in blackheads. My skin felt smoother and more glowing from within. The blue tansy in it helps with reducing irritation; this product was super gentle on my skin.  I can tell that the amount of product you receive will last quite a long time, which is great. I will definitely repurchase this once I run out.  My only complaint: the packaging is super chic but the fact that it's in a jar (rather than an airtight pump) makes me a little worried about contamination, so I make sure to wash my hands before opening and only leave the lid off for the shortest amount of time possible."

I followed the product recommendations, and started by using the mask daily for the first 4 days, then 2-3 times a week afterward.   It's not like other masks, in that the effect is gentle - so you're not peeling or scrubbing something off to get a big reveal. You simply wipe the product off after 20 minutes, and your skin feels clean, taut, and smooth. It definitely feels more effective than your run-of-the-mill sheet mask, and probably has more value for cost, too.   It's only been 2 weeks so far, but the product does what it claims to. I've been using it in conjunction with the Sunday Riley line, so I can't attribute the improved quality of my skin (firmness, clarity, minimized pores, smoothness, brightening/glow) solely to the mask, but I'm happy with the results thus far.   Also, the smell isn't overwhelming, and is gone basically as soon as you clean off the product. It smells like the Sunday Riley Luna Oil due to the blue tansy, but it isn't nearly as strong."

I did as instructed and used it daily for the first 4 days and immediately noticed that my skin felt cleaner and softer, which is saying a lot given the scarring, etc, caused by cystic acne. Obviously it's not going to disguise that, but it *has* made my skin look a little bit more even-toned, and using in combination with retinols/retinoids I am noting an obvious improvement.

Don't let the scent deter you from trying out this product. I've had to completely eliminate most scented products due to my eczema, and as a result, I now find most scented products off-putting. However, the scent of this product does not bother me at all. I apply this mask with a flat face brush, which applies a thin, even coating. This might help with the scent for some, since it won't go all over the place."

            "review_text": "I have quite a few masks in my rotation, so to be honest I'm not sure why I even bought this one, but I am glad to have it in my rotation.  This is a smooth, very liquidy gelly mask.  The scent is a little bit fruity and a bit floral, light and pleasant.  I applied with a brush, and it was not too messy.   When first applied there was definitely an intense tingly sensation, not quite burning, but like whoa this is working kind of tingly.  I left it on for 20 minutes. The mask was really easy to remove with a wash cloth, and there were no gritty exfoliating particles or dried clay which can sometimes be so irritating when removing.  I let my face dry before applying moisturizer and I was pleasantly surprised that my skin wasn't tight or overly dried out, but there had definitely been a lot of turnover.  Think that applying a few nights in a row would get really good results without being too irritating, but really only need a few nights a week.    When I woke up the next day, I was very happy with how smooth my skin felt, and it looked bright and radiant.  This really allowed my nighttime skincare routine to sink in.  This is on a similar level with my one or two other favorite exfoliating masks, both which use chemical ingredients to refresh the outer layer of skin. This is a good price, there is enough in the jar for many, many applications, and its only needed a few times a week. The packaging is simple, sleek and sophisticated.  Would definitely recommend.  Not for sensitive skin (or only use for reduced time).  Probably ok for acne, but doesn't have any specific acne fighting ingredients and there are better products out there.  Best for exfoliating dull winter skin.  Good for oily or dry skin."

(very few products I've tried give me instant results; hence the slow replies since I actually try before I review). So I wanted a AHA/BHA because of my blackheads (nose) and KP on sides of face. I left this on for 20 minutes and it didn't burn/tingle on my sensitive skin. The smell is strong. Almost like a mix of Vicks Vapor Rub and Apple Cider Vinegar. The colour is beautiful in the jar but a bit translucent when you put it on your face. The first time I think I put too little, the second time I was more generous. And I don't feel guilty being generous since this product is $46/Cnd. It's only 2.3oz but the bottle is filled, almost overflowing (be carefully when you open as it's on the top of the lid as well). The second day I used it (says to use 3-4 days in a row and then reduce to a few times a week) I felt a cooling sensation but again, I put a lot more product on my face. So after I removed the mask with a warm cloth I started my extractions. I have never had an easier time extracting in my life! & to top it off they didn't hurt extracting. Usually the kertosis pilaris on the sides of my face are so far down in the skin that I need a needle to lance them out but not this time. If you want a product that will help you DEEP CLEAN your pores you need this in your life! I'm going to try other products in their line and hope they are as amazing as this mask."

I have NEVER been this impressed by a skincare item before in my life and I cannot stop raving about it!  Cons: The packaging (beautiful, but I just don't like skin care products to be in jars) The smell is so strong and really strange  However despite the cons I cannot give this mask anything less than five stars.

My skin was very tightened up from the product (in a good way) once the mask is dried, and the texture of the mask was almost like a sheet of dried glue/thin rubber. I'm describing it poorly but I liked it a lot because the product stayed at where I put it instead of being messy and runny. I didn't really care about the tingly or the cooling sensation though..not obvious for me. It was very easy to wash off, especially when paired with a wet towel, and there's no sticky residue and my skin felt clean without being overly dried. So far so good.

The smell was a bit weird for me (same with the oil) but after a little while I get used to it and relax with it on my face :) It tingles a little bit at first but that too goes away! This jar will last me so long, the thin layer needed ensures that I get the most bang for my buck! As instructed, I have been using it every day for the first four days (i'll do another mask today) and then use it 1-2 times per week. I noticed it pulls up existing blockages so I do have a pimple or two from it but they go away so fast! And the existing ones I had when I started my trial with this mask are gone.

When I first opened it, I was obsessed with the beautiful blue color of the mask (though when you apply it, it goes on and dries clear). The smell is quite strong, but nothing that I can't handle. After cleansing my face, I apply the mask and leave it on for about 20 minutes, and then rinse it off and immediately moisturize my face. What I've noticed so far is that my few blemishes--both the visible ones and the ones forming under the skin--have started to disappear, and my skin looks so much brighter and feels so much smoother. I really like that the treatment ingredients in this mask are naturally-derived, so I feel better using it on my skin. Also, I don't find it to be incredibly drying. Overall, I highly recommend you try the Blue Tansy mask out!"

For reference, I have fairly sensitive, combo skin with mild dehydration and visible pores....and after using both this one and the pineapple brightening one, I still have the exact same skin. Be careful not to get this goop all over when you open the lid - very liquid-gel texture. Ingredient list seems great, which is why I was so eager to try these.

I feel like for as much product you need and how much you get Herbivore is a great bang for your buck. My skin is easily congested, acne prone, and combination and this mask was great. You definitely get a tingling sensation within the first couple of minutes but is dissipates after a bit. I love the blue tansy in this it reminds me of May Lindstrom's The Blue Cacoon without the $160 price tag. This mask leaves my skin so smooth and bright and afterwards I use Tata Harper's Rejuvinating Serum and my skin feels brand new.

I've tried many things from benzoyl peroxide to salicylic acid, Dr Gross peeling pads, GlamGlow masks, Origins masks, Boscia peels, natural and unnatural things. I've over exfoliated my face more times than anyone ever should. I do regular extractions, and my face just ends up the same! So I decided to give this mask a try. I absolutely adore that I can read ALL of the ingredients on the label. It smells really wonderful and isn't over drying. I use this mask daily currently, to get my skin to a state to where I'll probably use it twice a week. This mask gets rid of all the hardened ends on skin congestion so you can very easily extract all blackheads. My nose has never been so smooth! My face is like porcelain to put makeup on. It can be a little drying to use daily, so I exfoliate every couple days and make sure to follow up with the Lapis oil that doesn't seem to clog pores at all. I am now a lifelong customer.
