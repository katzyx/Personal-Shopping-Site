    "how_to_use": "Suggested Usage:.Conceal or even skin tone:.-Find and mix shades that most closely match your skin tone..-Next, layer on your customized concealer shade (lighter than your skin tone) using your ring finger or small brush to gently tap over any areas of concern. .Pro tip: .-Swatch shades along your jawline and blend towards the neck to find your best match.  ..Contour and highlight:.-Determine your face shape and what effect you want to create. .-Select a sculpting shade darker than your skin tone and apply to desired areas to create depth, blending upwards for the most natural effect..-Apply highlighter on the areas you want to illuminate, such as the upper part of the cheekbones, bridge of the nose, chin, and Cupid's bow...Pro tip: .-Mix the two sculpting shades until you achieve a hue that is complementary to your skinu2019s undertone, but a few shades deeper than your base.",

So much so, that I seized the opportunity of the Sephora sale to purchase another. Though Iu2019ve eyed the Saint palette makeup, its price was a bit steep for my budget. This palette is the solution Iu2019ve been searching for. For those considering an upgrade, I also recommend the HD Skin Face Essential - Corrected: Long-wear Full Face Cream Palette in Light to Medium. Itu2019s a worthy addition if you can spare the expense."

I found it was creamy enough that I could really blend it out and get some good coverage, so no need for additional foundation most days!  Having said that, there were certain colours I gravitated towards far more than others, and so one month in I'm already half-way through some shades while others will never be touched (just far too dark and warm-toned for me). I'd love the ability to refill my faves and maybe swap out the colours I don't use with others - maybe even a blush to make this a truly one-stop shop?!   Without the ability to refill I likely won't repurchase simply because it's far too expensive to only use half the palette, and/or have to get a whole new one every couple months just for the sake of a couple shades. No palette can be universal, so it needs to be customizable."

The other shades are an awkward in-between range that won't work for bronzer/contour if you have light skin.  The highlight shades are beautiful and perform similarly to the Merit highlighting balm. I'd say this palette is optimal for someone with a light/medium or medium skin tone. Or a MUA.  Overall this performs really well, it blends easily and it has been compatible with my other products. Longevity is also good. I'm just disappointed because based on the pictures online I thought I'd be able to use at least 6 of the complexion shades. In reality it's not worth it for someone with light skin. I really wish they released 3 versions of this palette for light, medium, and dark skin tones because they're very compact and great in theory. But for the price it's not worth it unless you have medium skin tone."

What I like about this palette is, one product in your hand does a multitude of tasks. ( I have light to medium...easily tanned skin in the summer months,  mature skin...)  The formulation easily blends,  Very creamy texture...basically I use the palette for:  concealer, hi light, sculpting, bronzing and warming ....so far, I've found w good skin prep pre-application, any shade I chose,  lasts all day. If a shade is too dark, lighten it w another shade, and vice versa. Versatility at its best...love this palette.  1 star removed because it is, in my opinion,  a slightly warm toned palette, and I prefer a cooler toned colour option.

            "review_text": "Honestly, this one kind of took me a while to figure out. I think that the more experienced you are with makeup, the more this palette will likely make sense to you.  This palette utilizes color, shadow, and an intriguing additional variable: shimmery highlighter. As such, you can use the shades to mimic light and depth on the face. For example, if you've ever applied a full coverage foundation, then you know that immediately afterwards, your face looks one-dimensional. The intent with this palette is to offer an all-in-one that gives dimension.  An easy way for beginners to approach this is: focus the light on the center of your face, and add depth where you contour as well as the perimeter of your face. You can also try looking at how outdoor light hits your face and mimic that with this palette.  Ok now for palette performance! This palette does feel high quality through and through. It's made of a sturdy tin material and the shades do melt into each other (exactly as you'd hope!) As a cream palette, it's not the most longwearing, but it's a good in-between of the performance of cream and liquid base products. I very much appreciate the skin-like finish!  You may need a selection of smaller brushes to work with these pans. You'll struggle to get a big ol' blending brush in to pick up the shades. I suspect you could also use your fingers if you wanted to.  Finally, the one note I have with this palette is that I am unsure it is truly universal. I think it would have been wise of MUFE to offer a lighter and deeper palette option, especially as this seems to specifically leave out cooler deep tones. That said, they do have a cream foundation palette that seems to fully cover all shades and undertones. IMO, if you have a cooler, deeper skin tone, you may want to compare this to that palette before purchasing.  Palette received complimentary from Makeup Forever; all opinions are my own."

But trying this brush, it just goes to show that I didnu2019t know what high quality was until I tried it! Thereu2019s a VERY noticeable difference. In regard to the palette, itu2019s perfect for everyone and everything. I guess I wasnu2019t quite sure which shade to use for what when I first got it, but quickly realized that theyu2019re all available for anything! Mix and match to find your perfect shade, and I LOVE that theyu2019re all cream products! The size is perfect and the shades are amazing. I love that there is a cool toned contour in there, something that is hard to find nowadays. I was gifted by Make Up For Ever in exchange for my honest review."
