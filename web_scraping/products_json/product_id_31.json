I have very dry skin, so I don't need a powder to do much, just to take away some shine from dewy products (right when applied, like I said my skin is dry and I don't get a drop of oil on my face throughout the day) and to set my makeup.  It does neither, after applying this poweder,  foundations (skin tints etc..)  stay exactly as dewy and as tacky as if I hadn't applied anything.  I tried using a loose powder brush, a dense brush, a powder puff, different foundations, no moisturizer underneath foundations, in other words I tried everything and this powder does absolutely nothing.  The powder is extremely finely milled, but I think to an extreme, and it gets to the point where it feels almost like it is 2 steps away from becoming a cream, therefore does absolutely nothing to take away shine and set makeup.  I don't like to return makeup and I actually tried to sell it for the same half of price that I paid for it (with Sephora points- which I didn't get back after the return) and no one wanted to buy it, I completely understand why."

It does such a great job setting my concealer under my eyes. I usually dust some all over my face and it plays so well with every type of makeup I own. This is never cakey and honestly has been fool proof for me so far. My ONLY complaint, and itu2019s not enough to deduct a star, is that the packaging can be messy when you open it. I always seem to get powder on my vanity or clothes, but it does easily brush off. Give this a try if you are looking for a new loose powder!"

I would say that this has more of a natural matte finish because it helps control my oils but my skin still has some glow to it after applying the powder. This product also gets bonus points from me because of the packaging. The packaging helps to reduce the amount of mess that normally occurs with loose powders."

            "review_text": "I love this powder so much not even just saying it to say it i really mean it. Iu2019ve had so many issues with my makeup not staying on or separating and looking oily after a full day wear but honestly this has made me makeup look so  so much better. It lasted me so so long I thought because the container isnu2019t as big as others it wouldnu2019t last. The mesh on there really helps you control how much powder is coming out. Ever since I switched to this powder so many people have told me my makeup looks so much more airbrushed/smooth. This powder really did make a big difference in my makeup. I love it because you can use it for the full glam and natural makeup days. After all the drug store and high end powders Iu2019ve tried this one is the only one that has worked for my skin. I even got my mom hooked on this powder. She loves it just as much as I do. When she gets compliments on her makeup she always says yeah itu2019s this new powder I tried ami cole. Lol I love that. Itu2019s so sad that itu2019s out of stock because this is the only powder that works for me. Iu2019m hoping it goes back in stock soon because mines run out and Iu2019ve got school in a couple of weeks. Iu2019m not trying to look greasy on the first day lol. Anyways if youu2019re thinking about buying this just get it because itu2019s worth it."

I usually go over my t-zone a second time with a more heavy duty powder (KVD setting powder or Coty Airspun). I have pretty prominent smile lines that I'll touch-up once or twice but there isn't any significant creasing. I'd say the only downside is the packaging, the little lid broke off after 3 or so weeks of using it but I didn't care much for it so it's not that big of a deal. I will say the box it came in was probably the nicest packaging I've seen used in makeup, the orange print was really pretty."

I'm extremely fair, so the problem I have with translucent powders is a lot of them darken my concealer/foundation, which then makes my face look a shade or two darker than the rest of my body. This powder maintains the color of my base products while setting my makeup so it doesn't move at all. Plus, it mattifies, but it doesn't mattify so much that my face looks two-dimensional or like I have no life in my skin. It's very natural, high quality, and blurring to boot. Such a fantastic powder and it should be getting WAY more hype!"

I don't think any product will completely stop the natural oil/shine, but it helps!! Also love the design of the container, especially the swifter net. It's like a tiny trampoline that allows only so much powder to come through once you dab it with a makeup brush."

It's soft, finely milled, with ZERO flash back. It's similar in texture to the Hourglass setting powder. AMI COLu00c9 has been my new favorite everyday powder because it keeps my makeup true to tone. It wear well against sweat, and can cut down on oiliness while keeping skin looking fresh. It's not intended to be mattifying and I'm okay with that. For the price and the range alone, go for THIS instead of the $49 HG powder. It works great dusted over sunscreen, too.  Minus 0.5 stars if I were to be nitpicky: The tinted powder can slightly darken my under eye concealer. Opt for the translucent powder in that case. The last thing to take note of is the accessibility of the packaging. I appreciate how it seals to prevent spillage, however it can be hard to open so keep that in mind for people with long nails, mobility issues, etc.  Overall, it works well with brushes, powder puffs and it smoothes out my skin texture. This powder is now on my roster!"

This leaves your highlight intact and doesn't interfere with the makeup you are trying to set.   I included a photo comparing it to two other Talc Free, Silica based Translucent powders, over UD Face Tape Foundation and 3 swipes of Rare Beauty Liquid Highlighter in Flaunt.  The LM one preserves glow, but it actually adds luminosity too so it is not mattifying. The It one has a slight iridescence to the naked eye, but actually applies extremely matte and tends to dull down glowy products.   None of these powders are bad, but just know what kind of finish you want and what you are buying and how you want to use it. I think the Ami Cole is a perfect balance to mattify without diminishing glow! Would definitely repurchase!"
