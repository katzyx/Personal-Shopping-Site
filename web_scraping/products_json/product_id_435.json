Has a great botanical smell which is invigorating. Be sure to use the moisturizer sparingly, a little goes a long way! The moisturizer works well under makeup. Also love the resurfacing pads, but using them every day was too much for me. Using them every other day has worked well."

I then went on with the facial pads and these were amazing. This helped remove any extra makeup that was on my face that the cleanser did not catch.

The set includes three products: the Pro-Collagen Marine Cream, Pro-Collagen Cleansing Balm, and Dynamic Resurfacing Facial Pads. Iu2019m always on the lookout for stuff thatu2019s good for all skin types (mineu2019s a mix of everything), so this was right up my alley.  The Breakdown: Pro-Collagen Cleansing Balm: This balm is awesome for getting rid of makeup and the dayu2019s grime. It feels super luxurious and doesnu2019t leave my skin feeling stripped. Plus, the texture is amazing.  Dynamic Resurfacing Facial Pads: These pads are a game-changer. One swipe and my skin feels instantly smoother and brighter. Itu2019s like a mini facial, but without the hefty price tag.  Pro-Collagen Marine Cream: Last but not least, the Marine Cream. This stuff is super hydrating without being greasy. My skin feels plumper and looks more youthful, which is always a win.  Overall final thoughts: If youu2019re like me and juggling work, social life, and everything in between, having a quick and effective skincare routine is a lifesaver. This trio makes it super easy to keep my skin looking and feeling great without spending forever in front of the mirror. Plus, the scents are really niceu2014spa vibes at home!!  Definitely recommend giving it a go if youu2019re after a balanced and glowing complexion. ud83dudc81u200du2640ufe0fu2728"

As someone who is always on the lookout for effective skincare solutions, this set has been a fantastic addition to my daily routine.  Firstly, the packaging is very thoughtful. The starter set includes everything you need to kickstart a collagen-boosting regimen: a cleanser, serum, moisturizer, and supplements. Each product is clearly labeled with instructions, making it easy to integrate them into my routine without any guesswork.  The cleanser is gentle yet effective. It left my skin feeling clean and refreshed without any dryness or tightness. I appreciated how it removed makeup and impurities while maintaining my skin's natural moisture balance.  The serum, perhaps my favorite part of the set, has a lovely texture that absorbs quickly into the skin. I noticed a visible improvement in the firmness and elasticity of my skin after just a few weeks of consistent use. My skin feels plumper and more hydrated"

The cleansing balm also had a slight cooling effect which I really enjoyed. I used a pea size amount and it removed all my makeup and didnu2019t leave my eyes all foggy. After washing my face I decided to use the facial pads to exfoliate. One thing I really liked was the facial pads were small and very easy access according to its packaging. The way the pads were designed really helped exfoliate my skin. It was like a mini face massage. I went in and used the day cream after everything. The consistency was lightweight and after rubbing it into my skin I was glowing. One thing I really admired with all these products was the way everything smelled. It made me feel very fresh."

It effortlessly melts away makeup and impurities, leaving my skin feeling deeply cleansed and nourished. The texture is luxurious, and it has a pleasant spa-like scent. My skin feels incredibly soft and clean without being stripped of its natural oils. The bonus is the smell of the balm, its refreshing and calming.   **Dynamic Resurfacing Facial Pads:** These pads are a great addition to my skincare routine. They gently exfoliate my skin, leaving it feeling smooth and refreshed. After using them, Iu2019ve noticed a significant improvement in my skinu2019s texture and brightness. Theyu2019re gentle enough for my sensitive skin and donu2019t cause any irritation.   **Pro-Collagen Marine Cream:** The Marine Cream is a true star in this set. Itu2019s lightweight, yet deeply hydrating. My skin feels plump and firm after using it, and it has a noticeable glow. Over time, Iu2019ve seen a reduction in fine lines and an improvement in my skinu2019s overall elasticity. The cream absorbs quickly and doesnu2019t leave a greasy residue, which is perfect for my combination skin.   Overall, the Elemis Collagen Discovery Set has transformed my skincare routine. Itu2019s easy to use, and I love the immediate and long-term benefits. My skin looks and feels healthier, more radiant, and youthful. I highly recommend this set to anyone looking to improve their skinu2019s texture, firmness, and overall appearance."

Next the Resurfacing pads, I like that they are gentle enough to be used everyday. They leave my skin feeling smooth and with a natural luminosity! Lastly, the marine cream has a lightweight gel formula which I love. I have combination, acne-prone skin so I like lightweight moisturizers, though this isn't intended for acne. It's intended to help fight wrinkles and signs of aging. So if you have oily, combo or normal skin and want to fight signs of aging with a moisturizer that doesn't feel thick and heavy, then this might be something you'd like!  I gave this set a 4 since I have other skin concerns I personally want to target more than anti-aging and I wasn't a huge fan of the bits of fragrance that these have. I think they should all be fragrance free to prevent chance of irritation."

This product makes my face feel extremely clean after I use it, and I can visibly see it tighten my pores after one use. I also use the cleansing balm in my nighttime skincare routine to help remove any makeup thatu2019s on my face by the end of the day. Both the face pads and the cleansing balm are now a necessity in my skincare routine! Lastly, the marine cream is one of the best moisturizers Iu2019ve used in a long time! I have very dry skin and not many moisturizers help me, but this one definitely has. Not only does it leave my skin feeling moisturized, but it also leaves my skin looking very glow which makes it a perfect base to apply my makeup over! Cannot recommend this product more."

This collagen Health Starter set was the perfect way to get to try the products before committing to buying the full sized products. After trying the products for a week i can honestly say that I am OBSESSED. Specially the Pro-collagen Cleansing balm is increible. So I use it dry on my face to remove my makeup and IT WORKS wonders at removing my eye makeup. This is really great because I can be gentle with my eye area instead of rubbing hard with make up remover wipes. It seriously melts you make up off!! I used a warm wash cloth to wipe away the make up and product and it felt heavenly. My skin was so soft afterwards too. The smell is light and fresh (not too over powering) and I for sure will be buying the regular size of this thing. Next is the Dynamic Resurfacing facial pads, I havenu2019t used something like these since my teenager days but I lie the scent and with a week of use I do feel like it has made my skin smoother with this gentle exfoliation. Finally, the final step is the Pro Collagen Marine cream which smelled absolutely lovely and was lightweight and moisturizing. I used this for a week and can slightly notice firmer skin. I am getting older and want to make sure that Iu2019m consistent with anti wrinkle creams and I think I may have found my new fave. If you are on the fence about trying Elemis out, again this is great way to experience the products in a smaller size before committing to the full size price. Highly recommend!"

The cleansing pads thoroughly cleansing the pores and removing impurities, probably both for a very sensitive skin but works amazingly as an evening routine to cleanse my skin after a long day, even after a cleansing the pads still took a lot from my skin. The cream is incredibly light and has a luxurious texture, providing super moisturizing benefits without feeling heavy or greasy. My skin felt cleaner and more hydrated after just the first use. The cleanser effectively removed dirt and makeup without causing irritation, and the deep cleansing pads left my skin feeling deeply purified. The moisturizing cream provided an instant boost of hydration, leaving my skin soft and supple. The cleanser, pads, and cream work seamlessly together, and easy to use."

The one thing I would note about these minis is they did have a pretty strong scent, so if strong fragrance is something you don't like that's something to consider. Otherwise though, this is a perfect set for traveling and for testing out three products that could be a great fit for your night routine :)"

Iu2019m not a fan of the mint sensation, but it didnu2019t irritate my sensitive skin at all. It removes makeup like a dream and leaves my skin feeling fresh.  Next, the exfoliator is a gentle pat that doesnu2019t feel harsh, leaving my skin smooth and bright.  Finally, the moisturizer is lovelyu2014soft, easy to apply, and hydrates well. I do wish it came in a bigger size, but it leaves my skin feeling nice and plump.  Immediate results? My skin feels clean, smooth, and hydrated right away.  Long-term? Iu2019ve noticed my skin looking radiant. Plus, the routine is so simple to follow, even on busy days.  Overall, the Elemis Collagen Health Starter Set is a must-try for anyone looking to simplify their skincare routine while still getting results."

I can really only use it in the wintertime, and donu2019t like using it around my eyes. This was actually my first time trying the exfoliating pads, and I really like them, especially compared to ones from other brands. I have rosacea and these did not sting at all, but did a lovely job removing dead skin and giving me a glowing complexion. Iu2019d recommend using them 2-3x a week. Overall, I love all of these products and highly recommend them, but have honestly seen better valued sets from Elemis before. This one seems a bit u201cshrinkflatedu201d."

Firstly, the texture is luxuriously creamy yet absorbs quickly into the skin, leaving no greasy residue behind. This makes it perfect for both morning and evening use, seamlessly fitting into my daily skincare routine."

Having tried quite a good deal of skincare products myself, I felt confidently sure of saying that this set outclasses. Well, first of all, the packaging is simply gorgeous and luxe to the feel. That already lends the impression this will be some really good quality. The sizes of each item within this set are pretty good, so it's perfect to see if you like the range before committing to full-size versions. This cleansing balm is really a game-changer: it makes quick work of removing makeup and cleanses my skin, leaving it so soft and nourished. Pro-Collagen Marine Cream is light but deeply nourishing. After using it, I already see an improvement in the texture and the firmness of my skin. I also love Dynamic Resurfacing Facial Pads. They are so gentle yet very efficient in cleaning the skin, leaving it smooth and radiant.   One thing I have become most grateful for is how soon it was that I could find a difference. My skin felt more hydrated, plump, and luminous. I got several compliments regarding my complexion since I started using these products. The only downside would be with the price point, but considering the results and the quality of ingredients, to me, it's well worth an investment. Generally, I do really highly recommend Elemis Collagen Health Starter Discovery Set to anyone who seeks more than an average skincare routine."

The cleansing balm was able to remove my waterproof mascara successfully. The resurfacing pads are an interesting product and I'm excited to see what long term use does to my skin. As someone with sensitive skin, nothing caused me irritation or breakouts. Overall it's a nice set but the set is a bit expensive for 3 minis. It's not a repurchase for me at full price but would be more tempting on sale."

The premoistened pads arent harsh on my skin even though I thought they would be. The moisturizer is the nice final touch to have my skin feeling fresh & soft after.

The cleansing balm can remove makeup very easily. It does say to not use inner your eyes, I have used it by my eyes since I did it without reading the directions and had no issue, I wash it off thoroughly before opening my eyes anyways. I typically use another cleanser to double cleanse after the balm. The moisturizer is also one of my favorites because it hydrates my dry skin deeply. The resurfacing pads feel like theyu2019re very effective although they sting where I have acne so Iu2019m not sure if theyu2019re the best for blemishes. The other aspect is the value for money and ratio of products youu2019ll get. I think youu2019ll run out of the pads first, then the moisturizer, then the cleansing balm. I donu2019t know that they really thought through how much to include based on when youu2019ll run out of each thing. Also for how much you get this is really expensive. The full size are expensive as well but the cost per volume is much better to me. If you just want to see if these are good for you maybe this would work to test them out but I wouldnu2019t buy this set for value."

The pads have also become a favorite. Gentle enough on the skin to use every day. I use this as my step right after my am very good splash of water. I donu2019t wash my face in the am. I apply water to awaken myself and loosen up all the night before skincare and to lightly rinse it off, and then this is where I will use these pads. And after the moisturizer is the perfect seal.

It is lightweight and absorbs fast, but keeps my skin, soft and supple all night long."

As a started kit is great, you have the balm that was viral and a total sensation in social media, for a reason believe me, it melts on your skin melting all the makeup and impurities away while leaving you with soft skin. The pads are great as part of your skincare routine and prep for makeup, I use them even in my body and they help with the back acne & hyperpigmentation. The collagen cream is great, moisturize your skin, the texture is a balance in between creamy and lightweight and itu2019s absorbed by your skin right away. Definitely is something that I recommend if you are a skincare beginner and also if you have been wanting to try Elemis for a while."

It definitely helped wipe away the cells causing irradiation because the next morning I found my pimple to not be as bad. It also left me with very nice smooth skin. I enjoyed the cleansing balm as well in this kit because it does a beautiful job at removing makeup with ease. No harsh rubbing or scrubbing necessary because the formula melts it off nicely and once water is added it really washes away dirt and makeup of the day. I like to use this as a face mask too because it leaves my skin super glowy and so soft and moisturized. Iu2019m also a fan of the marine cream and its hydrating gel formula. It absorbs so nicely and leaves my skin looking and feeling hydrated with a complexion that glows. Iu2019m definitely also noticed a plumper touch to my face which I love because Iu2019m all about that youthful appearance.

Itu2019s oil based so it really does the trick and wipes off easily with a wet warm cloth. The facial pads elude the freshest scent. The pad itself isnu2019t harsh as to graze against your skin but is also firm enough to feel resurfacing in a gentle way.

I've fallen in love with the cleansing balm- it is very effective at removing makeup. The treatment pads are easy to use and the moisturizer is great for day time use. After a week of using the set I've noticed my skin is more even and I haven't had any issues with breakouts. I think I'll be buying these products individually in the future, as I really enjoy them."

The resurfacing pads left my skin feeling so smooth and soft. They were very gentle on my skin. I actually really like the cleansing balm because I hate washing my skin at night. It rubs on before washing which helps me feel like I am getting it cleaner faster, and washes off with warm water. The cream is thick and luxurious, and a great ending to the routine. My skin glows and is so soft after this trio! It also has helped my fine lines and wrinkles."

I love how they grip and exfoliate any extra dirt build up on my face for a smooth result. As my final step in my quick routine I use Pro-Collagen Anti Aging Marine Cream. The moisture my skin soaks up and also reduces fine lines for plump skin.  I'm a big fan of how each has a subtle scent. I prefer light fragrances and natural one and these deliver.

I also liked that the finish after application didnu2019t feel sticky or tacky like with other chemical exfoliating products. I have used the pads a couple of times because my skin would get sensitive if I use it more often. But i start to notice that my skin begins to look more smooth and more even.   the cleansing balm. the texture of the cleansing balm is extremely creamy. itu2019s soft even at the room temperature, but it arrived completely melted. the scent is herbal, which is quite nice. it applies nicely on the skin. it emulsifies quite well too, without leaving a film. However, the balm didn't work well on removing the mascara that I used. The cleansing balm indeed leaves a nice fresh feeling on the skin, but since it doesn't do well with eye makeup, it's a deal breaker then."

As a millennial always on the go, I appreciate how these products streamline my regimen while delivering noticeable results.  The Pro-Collagen Marine Cream has been fantastic. It's lightweight, absorbs quickly, and keeps my skin feeling hydrated and smooth throughout the day. I love that it doesn't leave a greasy residue, making it perfect under makeup.  The Pro-Collagen Cleansing Balm is a delight to use. It melts away makeup and impurities effortlessly, leaving my skin feeling clean but not stripped. Plus, it has a luxurious texture that feels like a mini spa treatment every time I use it.  The Dynamic Resurfacing Facial Pads are a standout. They gently exfoliate my skin, leaving it brighter and more even-toned. I've noticed a reduction in the appearance of some fine lines and a smoother texture overall.  Overall, this set has really helped improve my skin's texture and hydration levels. It's convenient and effective, which is exactly what I need in my busy life. If you're looking to boost your skincare routine with some high-quality products, I highly recommend giving this set a try."

The moisturizer is pleasant, sort of a gel cream that isnu2019t too heavy and perfect for daytime. It did not clog my pores and worked beautifully under my SPF.

The cleanser left my face feeling clean, and the resurfacing pads made my face feel so smooth, And the moisturizer sealed everything in perfectly, leaving my skin feeling soft and supple! After a few weeks of consistent use, my fine lines looked less noticeable and I could definitely see improvements in skin overall! My complexion looked more even, and my skin felt firmer! All of the products came with clear instructions, and incorporating them into my daily routine was easy and straightforward. Each step complemented the others perfectly! Overall, the Collagen Health Starter Discovery Set from Elemis provided a simple and luxurious skincare experience with both immediate and lasting benefits! And I would highly recommend it!"

Here are my thoughts on each product:  Pro-Collagen Cleansing Balm: While effective, I find it a bit too heavy for daily use unless youu2019re removing makeup or sunscreen. It leaves a residue that makes me feel like I need a second cleanse, which isnu2019t ideal for everyday routines. I would have preferred a lighter cleanser in the kit.  Dynamic Resurfacing Facial Pads: These are the standout item for me. They effectively remove dirt and impurities that my regular cleanser misses. My skin feels cleaner and Iu2019ve noticed less dryness and more smoothness. However, clearer instructions and larger print on the packaging would be helpful.  Pro-Collagen Marine Cream: It provides excellent hydration and has noticeably improved my skinu2019s texture. Iu2019m not a fan of the scent, but the results make it worth it.  Since using these products, Iu2019ve experienced some breakouts, which might be part of the skin purging process, though this is debatable. Despite this, my skin feels more moisturized and smoother overall.  In summary, Iu2019d give this kit 4.5 stars if I could. The cleansing balm is great for heavy-duty cleansing but isnu2019t practical for daily use. Swapping it out for a lighter cleanser would make this kit perfect. Still, itu2019s a solid set for anyone looking to try out Elemisu2019s Pro-Collagen range."

Finally, the pads were a first time try for me but also great.  I recently had to travel due to a death in the family, and I had just tossed this box into my bag.

It includes all the necessary skincare products to give you the perfect nighttime skincare routine. The cleansing balm is a staple for removing my makeup! I love the oily texture that it turns into when I rub it in my hands and my skin feels so clean afterwards. The pads remove remaining dirt and help my skin feel super smooth. And then of course the collagen cream, which has been in my routine for a while, absorbs so well into my skin and leaves me feeling hydrated! Love this set!"

Unlike some exfoliating pads, these are not harsh and leave my face feeling refreshed and smooth. The Pro-Collagen Marine Cream is an excellent lightweight moisturizer, ideal for daytime use, especially during the summer. It provides just the right amount of hydration without feeling heavy or greasy, making it perfect for warmer weather when you want to keep your skincare routine light. As for the Pro-Collagen Cleansing Balm, it's unlike anything I've tried before. I used to rely on coconut oil to remove makeup and residue, but this cleansing balm has been a revelation. It effortlessly melts away impurities and leaves my skin feeling clean and nourished. Overall, this trio has significantly improved my skincare routine, and I highly recommend them to anyone looking for effective and gentle products."

After that, I proceeded with the resurfacing facial pads. They are great for a mild exfoliation. As the last step I use the pro-collagen marine cream. in my morning routine, I just skip the resurfacing facial pads. Iu2019m very happy with this set and I will re purchase."

I think itu2019s super cute and I am almost sad that I didnu2019t see this for Motheru2019s Day because this wouldu2019ve been a perfect little starter set as a Motheru2019s Day gift. It has all the essentials: the make up cleansing balm is the best cleansing balm I have ever found it smells so good. Itu2019s such a luxurious product, but well worth it. I have never tried the pads before, but I was very excited to receive those. They smell super good and you can definitely fill a small tingle. Nothing uncomfortable, but I can definitely feel them working. Iu2019ve been using them at night after I wash my face before I go with my nighttime skin care routine and I definitely feel like if Iu2019m consistent they will help, minimize my pores and smooth out my skin. The moisturizer, I love. I already have a large tub of that and like I said, Iu2019m keeping that from my summer travels to keep in my travel kit. I love it. I donu2019t necessarily love the scent of it as much as I like the scent of the other two, but I can overlook it because it is extremely heavily moisturizing, which is perfect for when youu2019re traveling and going from climate to climate, and your skin reacts differently. My skin tends to get dry and kind of crusty when I travel so this is perfect All in all, I would definitely recommend buying this product. This set is perfect for travel, perfect for gifting, perfect for just wanting to try the products but not wanting to commit to the full size or spend the money on the full-size products though they are pricey at 100% recommend them."

My skin has been feeling tighter and looks more radiant so far which is great during this summer season Iu2019m experiencing in New York City right now.   I LOVE Elemis.

Starting with the Pro-Collagen Cleansing Balm, I was impressed by how effectively it removed makeup and impurities while leaving my skin feeling soft and nourished. It has a lovely texture and a spa-like scent that makes the cleansing process feel luxurious.  Next, the Dynamic Resurfacing Facial Pads are a revelation. With just one swipe, my skin feels smoother and more radiant. These pads are gentle yet effective, making them perfect for daily use without irritation. I noticed an improvement in my skinu2019s texture almost immediately.  The final step, the Pro-Collagen Marine Cream, is an absolute delight. This moisturizer is lightweight yet deeply hydrating, and it absorbs beautifully. My skin feels firmer and looks more youthful with regular use. The GLA in these products visibly smooths and softens my skin, addressing my concerns about fine lines and dryness.  Overall, the Elemis Collagen Health Starter Discovery Set is an excellent introduction to high-quality skincare. It leaves my complexion balanced, glowing, and youthful. Highly recommended for anyone looking to elevate their skincare routine!"

The cleansing balm removes make up very well. But I donu2019t think it necessarily needs to be used for that purpose. You can simply use it as a first cleanse. Itu2019s very smooth and thick and it helps to hydrate the skin. The resurfacing facial pads are already sopping wet, which I love! You only need one to take care of your entire face and it is gently textured and not overly abrasive. Lastly, the pro collagen marine cream has a gel cream consistency and helps absorb quickly into the skin. It really hydrates your skin in this beautiful balanced way. I find that these products smell like a spa experience. My skin is left feeling perfect. I would incorporate each piece into my routine at different stages. I prefer to use the cleansing balm in the evening and use the facial pads during the day. I would use the marine cream as a day cream since it is meant for that, but you can easily use it for both day and night. Overall, I think that these products are gentle enough to give to anyone and that they would enjoy them and probably purchase the full-size versions themselves."

I really liked the exfoliating pads and would purchase again. They were great for using as the u201ctoneu201d step of my skincare and left my skin feeling extremely soft and smooth immediately after use. I was worried these might make me breakout but I used them once a day and had no adverse reaction.   The moisturizer is solid.

I have definitely seen a reduction in my fine lines in just 2 weeks! I need a restock!"

My pores clog easily, leading to breakouts, so heavy products tend not to work well for me (even though I need more hydration).  1. Pro-Collagen Cleansing Balm - 2.5/5 Pleasant eucalyptus scent, but this cleanser was somewhat thicker/dry compared to other cleansing balms I've used. I had to use a lot of product to go over my entire face and I wasn't as happy with the results. Very visibly clogged pores, etc. I havent reached for it again, and probably would not purchase for myself.  2. Dynamic Resurfacing Facial Pads - 5/5 These are GOLD and I plan to purchase them. I have a very hard time finding toning products that aren't overly drying, but also clear out my pores. My face feels smooth and not parched after using. I would recommend giving these a try.  3. Pro-Collagen Marine Cream - 4/5 This is a very nice day cream, and I used the entire tube. I will say, the fragrance is pretty heavy and it lingers for a bit. It's not unpleasant, but also not my favorite. I've also noticed that my skin is a bit drier after straying from my regular brand for a week. I probably would not purchase for myself for this reason, though I still think its a good product. Skin feels plump and hydrated after use - I would just need to add more hydation if I used long term.  Overall I enjoyed trying out this kit, and would try more products from this brand. If you're new to Elemis, I'd recommend giving this kit a try. I received this kit in exchange for my unbiased review."

It was a great way for me to try out Elemis products and see how well they work for my skin.  The kit includes deluxe minis of the Pro-Collagen Cleansing Balm, Dynamic Resurfacing Facial Pads, and the Pro-Collagen Marine Cream, which is awesome because I am on the go a lot, so I do appreciate having items I love in sizes that fit in my makeup bag.  Iu2019ve always been about moisturizing and skin care because my mom always stressed the importance of it (& looks young for her age still).  But now that Iu2019ve hit my mid-40s (I swear I was 33 last week - not sure what happened), the collagen is a game changer and skincare is ever so important.  I loved everything in the box - the ball, the facial pads, and the moisturizing cream!  Itu2019s convinced me to try some other products from this brand and I definitely want to buy the marine cream in a larger size."

These products did leave my face feeling clean. My face did not break out and these products did not dry out or irritate my skin. I have normal skin not to oily and not to dry. My skin has never been sensitive so no problems for me.

            "review_text": "I received the Elemis Best Sellers Trio from Influenster in exchange for an honest review. This trio includes travel-sized versions of the Elemis cleansing balm, dynamic resurfacing pads, and pro collagen day cream.  While the dynamic resurfacing pads were new to me, I've been using the cleansing balm for months, preferring its original formula over the rose version. The balm efficiently removes makeup without the need for double cleansing, making it perfect for travel or lazy evenings. Its thick texture suits my skin year-round and has a pleasant, light scent.  The dynamic pads, housed in a convenient container, were properly hydrated and easy to use. They felt good on the skin and seemed to help with hormonal breakouts. I would be interested in purchasing this separately.   As for the day cream, this was my least favorite out of the three products. It is a nice product and I would use it again, but it irritates my cheeks and it doesnu2019t wear well with my sunscreen. I actually prefer to wear this at night because I find it too heavy to wear under makeup. I do like this product and would use it again, I just donu2019t absolutely love it.   The set is designed to last at least two weeks, with the dynamic pads lasting exactly that long if used daily. I still have half of the cleansing balm left and have found that this size jar can last me 1-3 months, depending on usage. Overall, I've been impressed with the products and would recommend the set for travel or as a gift, particularly for those interested in Elemis' pro collagen line. I am rating this five stars because in terms of a trial or travel set, I canu2019t really think of anything that would make it better. I personally would buy this set for when I travel."

Elemis is one of my favorite skin care brands, and I was so excited to check out this best sellers kit. I had used the pro-collagen cleansing balm before, and itu2019s one of my favorite cleansing balms. It has a really nice, thick texture that keeps my skin hydrated while getting rid of all my makeup. I can also use it to take off my eye makeup without any stinging, burning, or eye discomfort. It also smells so good, likely due to the rose and mimosa waxes present in the balm. The dynamic resurfacing facial pads provide a gentle exfoliation that doesnu2019t irritate the skin at all. I have oily skin that starts to look dull without regular exfoliation, and these immediately brighten the look of my skin. I really liked how one side was textured just to add a little bit more exfoliation to the gentle AHA thatu2019s already infused into the pads. Finally, the kit includes the pro-collagen marine cream. This cream is meant to help improve the appearance of wrinkles. I canu2019t really speak to that part, as I have young skin, but it did feel very moisturizing without clogging up my pores. I have acne-prone skin, but this cream didnu2019t cause any breakouts despite the fact that it feels very hydrating. This kit is perfect for a gift, for anyone new to Elemis who wants to try out their most popular products, or just for skin care lovers like me!"

It felt way too heavy on my skin and it didn't feel like it helped cleanse at all. Definitely not for makeup removal. Though it left my skin soft, even after using the other products I could still feel it on me. All products were gentle & even with how heavy the balm was I didn't break out, which was a bit surprising to me. The resurfacing pads were a bit flimsy to rub on a circular motion and I'd probably like that product as a liquid I could use on my own cotton or cloth to apply. The marine cream smelled so nice and was light but there was so little of it in the bottle and when I finally was able to get some out, too much came out of it and you really only need a small amount to get the full benefit of it. If you'd like to try these products without buying the full ones 1st, I think this is an excellent kit to do so. The stars is based more on the products in this kit themselves and my experience with them. I'd give the resurfacing pads 4 stars, the marine cream 5 and the balm 2."

The balm and cream are nice and gentle, but I the resurfacing pads are a little much for my sensitive skin to use every day.

It also feels really gentle on the skin. The Elemis Dynamic Resurfacing Facial Pads made my skin feel so nice and they also didnu2019t irritate my skin. There is no strong scent on this product which is great! The last item that came in the set was the pro collagen marine cream. This doesnu2019t have a strong scent either which I love! This was an amazing moisturizer! I loved it! I can be a bit picky with what skincare items I like but I can tell you that all three items were the best! My skin looks so clear and feels so smooth. My skin also looks so healthy. If you are looking for some good quality skincare definitely get this! I donu2019t purchase high end skincare that often but if I needed some I would buy these especially the marine cream itu2019s that good. Overall Iu2019m so grateful I was sent this set to try because I love trying out skincare and I loved that there were three products to try out. Sets are the best because you can try a couple of products from the brand. I highly recommend all three of these skincare items."

I donu2019t notice any difference after using this for 3 weeks vs my normal skin routine of LRP cleanser and moisturizer, which I am already happy with.

I really wanted to save it for my next travel but couldnu2019t wait any longer. I used balm + pads in the evening and moisturizer in the morning. Sometimes I tried pads in the morning before I applied moisturizer. Cleansing balm - I know that Elenis ball has been viral but I personally was getting a feeling that I need to used another cleanser after not because it didnu2019t clean . Something about the formula and my oily skint felt strange. When wiping with pads , it washed off all the make up .Balm worked, pads were clean .  Pads gave me slight tingle , left my skin a little sticky . I didnu2019t like the feeling. Moisturizer was my favorite likened the smell , texture and how my skin felt after as I applied sunscreen + make up over. Overall great size when traveling."

            "review_text": "The Elemis skincare kit exceeded all my expectations when it came to taking care of my combination skin. From the moment I tried the complete kit, I was pleasantly surprised by the effectiveness of each product. The Dynamic Resurfacing Pads were a game-changer, delivering a deep cleansing sensation that not only removed impurities but also left my skin texture noticeably smoother and revitalized. One of the standout products for me was the Pro-Collagen Cleansing Balm. Its luxurious texture made the cleansing process a true indulgence, and the results were remarkable. My skin felt firmer, more toned, and incredibly refreshed after each use. The gentle yet effective formula worked wonders in restoring my skin's natural balance and radiance. When it came to addressing deep wrinkles and maintaining optimal hydration, the Pro-Collagen Marine Cream proved to be a lifesaver. This rich cream provided the perfect solution for smoothing out stubborn wrinkles and keeping my skin hydrated without feeling greasy or heavy. The result was plump, supple skin that looked and felt rejuvenated. Beyond the visible results, the subtle scent of the Elemis products added an extra layer of luxury to my skincare routine. While I typically prefer stronger fragrances, the delicate aroma of these products provided a sense of prolonged cleanliness and relaxation that I truly appreciated.  I think it would also be a great gift to give to a loved one, the size could be a little bigger, but the packaging is perfect. Beautiful and attractive. In conclusion, I wholeheartedly recommend the Elemis skincare line to anyone looking to achieve firmness, luminosity, and an overall pleasant sensory experience in their skincare routine. With a combination of effective formulas and luxurious textures, Elemis has truly elevated my skincare routine to new heights."

Itu2019s amazing under my makeup and keeps my skin hydrated and plump without breaking me out! The scent is also very nice, itu2019s refreshing. The cleansing balm is great for removing my makeup and buildup from the day before I wash my face, it has a different scent from the pro collagen marine cream, itu2019s a zingy lemon and ginger scent.  The last thing I tried was the resurfacing pads. These ones smell like peach candy! I like to use this one once a week when I do my skincare treatments as exfoliating can irritate my skin if I use it a lot. Out of all 3 my favorite would have to be the marine cream! Definitely going to have to repurchase. This is a great way to test these products before you buy the full size and would make an amazing gift!"

Pro Collagen Marine Cream: I have been using this product for over 3 years, and have even gifted it a few times. Itu2019s a staple in my routine, and notice a difference in my skin when I run out. I have sensitive skin and it can often react to new products. I have never had a negative reaction to any of the Elemis products. The cream is light, feels like silk on the skin, and absorbs quickly. It also layers beautifully under makeup. My skin looks more plump and youthful when using this. There is a slight spa like scent, but itu2019s only noticeable in the jar and not when applied.  Resurfacing Pads: I use these pads 3 to 4 times a week but, I think they are gentle enough to use daily. Skin texture isnu2019t a real issue for me, so I canu2019t speak on terms of that, but I do notice a glow after using them. Each pad is very saturated, so one can be used on the entire face.  Cleansing Balm: This is my least favorite product that I have tried from Elemis. It does a nice job of removing makeup, it is a  tad thick and it takes longer to rinse off with water. The skin is left hydrated and not greasy or oily. My personal preference is a cleansing oil with a pump. This is the most fragranced of their products.   Although I highly recommend this brand, especially the Pro-Collagen Marine Cream I would suggest skipping this set as they are tiny sample sizes and go for the full size, you wonu2019t regret it."

            "review_text": "I'm extremely excited to be chosen to review this set. Not only because I'm a HUGE fan of the pro collagen cleansing balm which I've been using for a few years now, but now I have the opportunity to complete the treatment with steps 2 & 3.  Step 1 - I've tried SO many cleansing balms before, from the cheapest to a luxury brand and trust me, nothing beats Elemis. I'm not a huge fan of scented facial products but this balm is something else, light and calming - a spa-like scent. A little really goes a long way. It washes off really easy without leaving any residue- which is a huge differential from all the other cleansing balms I've ever tried. It does leave me a little dryness sensation around my nose when used individually, but nothing intolerable. It's great for removing make up without burning your eyes.  Step 2 - Great scent, though I wish it was scentless just because this is the type of product you don't typically use as a last step of your skincare routine. I love this is a very thin facial pad. It comes with the right amount of product without feeling you're using too much (or too little) of it. It has a very gentle exfoliating texture added to it. It adds luminosity, great for dark spots around the eyes and moisture after using the cleansing balm. I haven't used for 28 days yet to confirm it removes the dead cells and accelerate the skin's natural cell turnover, however, I can attest I really like the way things are going.  Step 3 - This is a day anti-wrinkle hydrating cream, so it's better if it's used as part of your morning routine. Lightweight, adds a very soft and hydrating layer on your skin.  It reminds me of a primer layer. This has the typical marine scent from any skincare product that contains such ingredient: fresh, calm, adding moisture with the intention of minimizing pores and skin. 100% approved.  Overall, I do recommend this set and it is a great option of a set since it contains a cleanser, an exfoliator and a moisturizer."

The next step was the Dynamic Resurfacing Facial Pads. These left my skin my red and I would not use again. Nothing explains what these are using to resurface, nor is there any guidance on how often to use. I looked at the ingredients and saw lactic acid. Any kind of exfoliator needs to have clear guidelines and disclosure on what it is you are putting on your skin. It was also heavily fragranced. The Pro-Collagen Marine Cream had a great texture but soo much fragrance. It was as though I was spraying perfume on my face. After trying these products, I think they are over-hyped and skin irritating to those who cannot tolerate synthetic fragrances in products. I would not purchase these in full size."

It was non-irritating and left my face feeling cleansed and moisturized. The second step was the exfoliating pads which also smelled amazing. The pads were thin but effective. It was easy to use and I could feel a coolness to my face after applying. The final step was the moisturizer which you definitely do not need a lot of. It left my face feeling smooth and shiny. I loved using this entire kit and will definitely use it again!"

Because I have sensitive skin, I used them only twice a week at night and the next day my skin was be soft and smooth.

The amount in the kit I feel like will last a very long time. I use about a big pea size amount and a little goes a long way. I use it every morning. The texture is smooth and silky. I love that you can use it to wash your face or also as a mask. It didn't irritate my skin at all. After I used it my face has never felt softer. This one was my 2nd favorite in the kit.   Marine cream:  The size in this kit is very small. I feel like it's not enough product to get a good feel for the anti wrinkle part of it. I didn't really see a difference in the way my skin looked after using it. There is a slight smell to it, but it's not very strong. My skin didn't really react to it in a bad way. The consistency is your typical face lotion. After using it my skin felt very hydrated, smooth, and extremely soft. This was my favorite thing in this kit, I just wish the product size was bigger to test if it was actually anti wrinkle.   Facial pads:  The packaging was nice and basic. In this kit you get a good amount to try out. They come very soaked with product, which is nice. They have a very light clean sent. Super easy to use. I don't think my skin liked these very much. After using them my skin felt red and irritated. I though I needed to be more gentle when using them, but that didn't help any. I wouldn't really say that I have sensitive skin, so if you do this might not be a product you'd want to try. This was my least favorite out of all three."

No harsh scrubbing like you have to do with other makeup remover products. I have been using the toner pads most evenings after washing, and they make my face feel clean and refreshed after a long day. One pad is enough for entire face and neck! I didnu2019t think I would love the marine cream as much as I do! It smells like luxury in a bottle and it absorbs so well into the skin. The SPF does not have a white cast and this does not burn my face. Overall, I am very pleased with this product!"

I liked that I only had to use a small amout of balm to get the job done. I enjoyed the the dynamic resurfacing facial pads, I first noticed how smooth my face looked and how my pores were smaller in appearance. I liked how the pads felt texture wise, they are exfoliating yet soft. Best of all is Elemis Pro-Collagen Marine day cream! I noticed that my wrinkles were minimized, and I felt like my skin was soft and hydrated all day. I like the light consistency of this cream too, my face loves it.  I used Elemis products for a week, and could noticeably see a difference in the overall appearance and health of my skin, my face is truly glowing! I highly recommend Elemis skincare set to my family, friends and just anyone wanting healthier skin."

The cleansing balm had an off-putting chemical smell each time I opened the jar. It faded once I applied it to my face, but if you have sensitive skin, please use caution. Also with the cleansing balm, I felt like I had to use quite a bit of product to fully coat my face and neck. Now onto the good news. First, these products felt very luxurious and were lovely to use. This goes double for the moisturizer (my favorite of the trio). I have dry combination skin and typically use a hyaluronic acid serum to help with hydration, but I didnu2019t need to use a serum while testing these products. The cleansing balm and moisturizer had very nice textures, and the facial pads kept their moisture throughout the two weeks. Overall, I think this kit is a great way to test out the brand."

Following with the pads which are also of a strong scent and lastly the lotion which was fine. I thought my skin after two weeks of solid use was ruddy, red and seemed dryer they my normal routine. It may work for some, but it wasn't for me unfortunately! I will say om a positive note my skin did remain smooth to the touch and no breakouts occurred so there were no negative reactions!

I do think the cleansing balm is to greasy for my combination style skin. I opted out of using it after the 4th time as I did not like the feeling at all.

Adding these products into my routine has been seamless, as I do the pads before applying my Elemis toner and after using my Elemis facial cleanser. I keep all of my facial products and serums in a skincare fridge for the best results. I canu2019t wait to try even more Elemis products in the future! I highly suggest getting this kit if you want to try some out."

I typically use a similar system, but I've noticed my normal system hasn't been hydrating enough for my winter dryness. The Elemis kit has been able to combat my dry skin amazingly. I love how moisturizing the cleansing balm is, it's gentle and smells great. After I use the balm, I use the resurfacing pads which are gentle enough for me, but they do gently exfoliate the dryness away. My favorite is the moisturizing cream. It smells great and is super hydrating. My face looks glowy and smooth after applying, and my makeup goes on well over it. I was breaking out before starting this kit, and within days, my breakouts were clear!! I will continue using this and will purchase full size products."

I also enjoyed the botanical scent of it. If it did leave any residual oiliness on my face, the wipes would remove it. I was worried the wipes would leave my skin feeling dry, but they surprisingly didnu2019t. My favorite product of all 3 was definitely the moisturizer. It left my skin feeling SO soft and radiant and had a very subtle, enjoyable scent. It also didnu2019t cause any breakouts, which I was nervous about. I will probably end up purchasing the moisturizer because I like it so much. This would be a great gift for a skin care junkie!"

The cleansing balm threw me off a bit as it feels like a vaseline. With how pricey this product is, that made me a bit crazy as it would get under my nails and felt wasteful. There is a strong smell that lingers but it was pleasant so it didn't bother me. I was skeptical that I would see results in such a short time but I can honestly say I am seeing a brightness and fullness to my skin. Additionally when I first started I had some nasty dry spots due to over zealous retin-a use and the moisturizer quickly took care of that, faster than any other product in my arsenal. I would love to continue using this product as I feel it does what it promises."

The cleansing balm has a relaxing scent which I like. It needs to be applied onto dry skin and then massage and rinse. I like it since itu2019s not over-drying after I use it.   The exfoliating pads are next after using the cleansing balm. It also has a slight scent to it which I donu2019t mind. It does help to clean and exfoliate the skin, but itu2019s probably not for those with sensitive skin since it kind of stings after using it. I did feel a little tingling on my face but was fine after few seconds. Probably best to use once every 2 days or so.   The moisturizer was alright, not the best. It doesnu2019t feel super hydrating but it does the job. Probably not the best moisturizer for those with dry skin. I have normal skin but I had to use another moisturizer on top of it because it just didnu2019t feel hydrating enough. On top of that, the scent was very strong for me personally. It would be great if there wasnu2019t any fragrance at all!   Overall I would give a 3 stars because for the price, thereu2019s something better. Also stars taken off due to the fragrance in all 3 products."
