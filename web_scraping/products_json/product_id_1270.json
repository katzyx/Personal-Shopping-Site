Every time applied, no matter if I used a beauty blender or a brush, it came out splotchy on my skin. I love the two-product compact to minimize products in my bag. The idea was great, but the execution fell short with the formula for me. I will still try other products from this brand despite this product not working out for me. I returned."

The product itself, (shades together or alone) have a skin like finish and applied easily. But I agree, it can apply patchy, and the product is not suited for beginners.
