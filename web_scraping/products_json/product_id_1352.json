Some ladies even ask what blush and shade. My skin is oily and Iu2019m medium tan skin complexion."

The glow this product gives me is goddess material, the colour is amazing, and the packaging is beautiful. If you want something similar to the highlighter but also want a pop of colour this is for you. I will say it was just a little bit hard to blend out and once it's on it's on for hours, so I wouldn't recommend this for everyday or for subtle looks, but if you want to pop and be that girl then this is 100% the way to go. Also try this on in store before you buy, the shade joy is not as orange as it seems. I was a bit scared of the colour at first but when a i tried it on irl it was amazing. I heard it's very fragile, I haven't had any problems though so idk.  I tried the cream blush too and if this much shimmer (it's really shimmery) is not your taste, I would look into the rare beauty cream blush!  Also, I know a lot of people say match the powder with your liquid blush, I don't necessarily agree. I have the colour hope in the liquid form and I got joy in the powder. They match amazingly.

It gives you a natural, glowing-from-within look without any glitter settling into your pores. Let's be real, everyone has pores, and it's time to accept that nobody walks around with a Paris filter on their face. While you'll see your pores with this product, it's much less noticeable compared to other brands. This blush wears more beautifully than Hourglass, yes, I said it! It gives that perfect bright, wet, glow-from-within look with just a touch of brightness.  I plan to pick up a couple more shades because I've never received so many compliments on my skin!"

I donu2019t have a lot of texture in my face but this blush emphasizes me my pores A LOT, like A LOT. It didnu2019t sit too well on top of my makeup. Itu2019s sheer but buildable. I bought the shade happy and Joy and I wanted happy to be more of a pale cool pink but I felt like it had purple undertones (if that makes sense). Shade is more on the orangey peachy side. These blushes arenu2019t all that in my opinion and were disappointing from the second I first tried them on. I would never buy these again"
