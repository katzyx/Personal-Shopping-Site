    "how_to_use": "Suggested Usage:.-Use a light hand when picking up productu2014because the formula is full pigment, a little bit goes a long way. .-To apply eyeshadow, use a flat brush to deposit color, highlight, or pack eyeshadow onto the lid. .-Use a fluffy-ended brush to diffuse and blend out shadow. .-For a more intense color payoff, pair metallic shades with a setting spray. .-Use the matte and metallic eyeshadows as highlight shades. .-Use the warm matte-neutral eyeshadows for contouring and defining, and the warm- and cool-metallic eyeshadows as accent shades. . ..PRO TIPS:.-For a more intense color payoff, pair the metallic shades with a setting spray. .-Create a gradient smoky eye look using a cool-tone shade for contouring and a warm-tone shade for blending out. .-The contrast between the warm and cool tones come together to create a high-impact eye look. .-Use any of the bright shades as a cheek color. .-Use the deeper matte shades to define the lash line. .-The highlight shades can be used on the face.",
