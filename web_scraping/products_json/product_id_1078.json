Yes, thereu2019s perfume but it doesnu2019t affect my eczema at all. Otherwise, works great on sunburns."

Facial mists are meant to be used in conjunction with your other facial products because some products are best applied to damp skin. A facial mist dampens skin after cleansing so that your other products can go on smoothly and have some water to work with.  Don't use this by itself- use it under your serum so that there's a layer of moisture in between your just cleansed face and your product, so that any hyaluronic acid in your skincare isn't pulling water FROM your face! Hyaluronic acid will take whatever moisture is the most convenient- and if you're putting it directly onto a dry face, that's going to be your skin!  For what it's meant to do, it works great. I've noticed that my skin is a lot less dry and flaky since adding this to my skincare routine.  The best way to use this is to cleanse, pat your face dry, spray a light layer, then immediately add your serum or moisturizer over top before it dries completely. You want that dampness!  I like that this facial mist is basically just water and humectants- it's designed to really add moisture when used properly.  Again, do NOT just spray it over your face without doing anything else. If absolutely WILL dry your skin out if you use it by itself."
