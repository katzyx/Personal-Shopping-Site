The heart features delicate rose, which adds a soft, feminine touch, while the base of musk and woody notes grounds the scent, making it warm and inviting. Lasting around 5u20136 hours on my skin, and the sillage is subtle yet noticeable, perfect for everyday wear or special occasions. Overall, I like this perfume but I think is going to be more suitable for older women."

The back features a beautiful geometric design, adding a touch of sophistication. The lid effortlessly pulls off to reveal the spray nozzle, making application a breeze.  The scent is a lovely blend of rose and blond wood, creating a light, powdery, floral fragrance that's both pleasant and easy to wear. The fragrance embodies themes of freedom, confidence, and positive energy, which is exactly what I need at this stage of my life. I truly enjoy this fragrance and highly recommend it."

The scent is an enchanting blend of floral and woody notes that exudes elegance and sophistication. Its long-lasting fragrance leaves a captivating trail wherever I go, garnering compliments all my friends and family. Literally someone in the elevator asked me which fragrance I was wearing. The chic and modern bottle design adds a touch of luxury to my vanity. Irresistible by Givenchy is truly a fragrance that lives up to its name, making every moment memorable and leaving a lasting impression. Would definitely purchase it once I run out of this one!"
