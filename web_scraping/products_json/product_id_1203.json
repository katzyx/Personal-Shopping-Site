As you can see I have very long hair but it is also so fine and tangles very easy. ESPECIALLY when it is wet!! If I am not careful what products I use I will have a giant mat of tangled wet hair at the end. I LOVE THIS SET!! I find the pre-wash treatment to really ease my tangles. I love the shampoo, it does not leave my hair dried out and stripped or too tangled up to get my fingers through! And the conditioner is so amazing as well! Itu2019s not too thin (where it does nothing) and itu2019s not too thick (where it makes my hair heavy) it is PERFECT! And my hair is left so easy to brush!!"

            "review_text": "I started doing hair at 16 years old, I've been a licensed cosmetologist for over 20 years and I can honestly say in all my time in the beauty industry I've never seen a product truly change the game the way Olaplex has! It really blows my mind that this brand was first developed in a garage in California! Olaplex has totally changed what us hairstylists are capable of achieving with our clients. The Strong Days Ahead Set is a perfect set for at home up keep, it keeps the bonds of hair strong between visits to the salon and I highly recommend it to friends, family and clients. If your looking for a shampoo and conditioner that smells amazing this isn't it, the olaplex #4 and #5 doesn't have any beautiful fragrance added or anything to make it feel or smell luxurious but was made for the health of your hair, they have a light clean scent that isn't really noticeable at all honesty. But the shampoo will last quite awhile when used properly because it's ultra concentrated, a little really goes a long way as it's really thick and suds up immediately when water hits it. The conditioner is the same way, you don't need alot. Alot of people will probably be confused as to how to properly use the #3 Hair Perfector so definitely read and follow directions. I personally like to do a light shampoo first and then towel dry my hair because I don't wash my hair every day and I do use styling products and on occasion hair spray so I like to remove any product and oil from my hair prior to applying the #3, then I towel dry my hair really well go remove as much moisture as possible so the #3 is at its fullest strength after applying, then I allow it to sit for a minimum of 10 minutes, you can allow it to sit on the hair for longer but it should be a minimum of 10.. Then another shampoo and condition with the #5 and you'll be amazed at how healthy and strong your hair will feel. This set will help restore shine, luster, lost curl pattern and more."

I really love how much the shampoo foams up, it really helps my scalp feel clean but doesnu2019t strip it! The pre wash mask adds a nice shine that I love but obviously you only are supposed to really use it every so often. The conditioner is also nice but I donu2019t think I would use it in place of my normal curly hair conditioner because the result after showering without adding curl cream is a decent amount of frizz and my curls arenu2019t really defined. The value of the set is apparent, but going forward I probably would only really buy the shampoo and not a full set like this. For someone who has dry/damaged or straight hair not needing a curl definition, I would say this is a go to, salon quality set."

Many people with textured hair like to run away from Olaplex because they assume it has protein but it contains bis amino which repairs broken hair bonds but of course everything to repair your hair should be used in moderation. I used the treatment (number 3) for 10 minutes then shampoo and conditioned my hair as normal and my coils look so healthy and defined. I'm in love with this product prior to this I only used the clarifying shampoo from Olaplex which was great but I'm happy I got my hands on this set."

Let's start with the shampoo - first off, the scent is absolutely worth the price alone. My hair feels like I just left a salon with that scent, it's a gorgeous powdery clean scent. The lather was decent and my hair was left clean afterward but not stripped which is huge for my drier leaning hair. The conditioner is the perfect compliment to follow for my light and fine hair, it was thick enough to condition my ends but light enough that it didn't weigh my hair down or feel like it left any residue. These are salon style products for a reason. The last shining star of this trio is the hair perfecter mask - a little goes a long way, but she does the heavy lifting of keeping my hair shiny, soft and smooth on a weekly basis. I highly, highly recommend this trio and I will continue to use it as my holy grail hair care."

The kit contains a pre-shampoo treatment, a shampoo, and a conditioner-such a good value! The treatment is applied before shampooing, left on for like 10 mins, and rinsed out. It can be used up to 3 times a week depending on the amount of hair damage. I use it twice a week. Just the pre-shampoo treatment alone has already made an extreme difference in my hair. The shampoo has a thick consistency to it, but I can tell that it has nothing but good ingredients for my hair. The conditioner feels like silk when applied; very luxurious. The shampoo and conditioner both lathered up perfectly, just the right amount of suds, and washed away easily, too. All 3 products didn't have a strong scent-they have more of a subtle and clean smell. All 3 of these products in this kit have done so much for my hair! I'm seeing less frizz, fly aways, split ends, breakage, and all the other signs of hair damage. My hair looks and feels healthier, stronger, shiny, and put together! Olaplex has definitely saved the day and saved my hair! I know that I'm protected from future damage as well. I couldn't be more grateful!"

I found the packaging fun and the bottles are a great design with a sturdy cap that can be set upside down to ensure I get the complete product out of the bottle. While I routinely use a shampoo and conditioner the pre-shampoo treatment was new for me, but works really easily. I was able to run this through damp hair and let it sit while getting ready for my shower.  The shampoo is very thick and produces a rich lather that almost reminds me of dish soap. Provides an effective clean and rinses out cleanly, leaving my hair, feeling clean without being stripped of moisture. The conditioner is a bit thin for my liking, but sits on my hair nicely and felt very hydrating and nourishing when rinsing.  Overall, my hair feels a bit more nourished, and Iu2019m excited to see long-term with the benefits will be from using this kit."

As a licensed cosmetologist of over 13 years years of experience, Iu2019m always on the lookout for products that  deliver real results. Olaplex has been a big name in the industry for years. I had shied away from it for a short while but am thankful I had the opportunity to try it again. First and foremost, the formulation of this is outstanding. . I noticed an immediate difference in the texture of my hair after just one use. The conditioner has a rich,  consistency that applies smoothly and detangles effortlessly without overwhelming my hair. This is crucial, especially for clients with damaged or chemically treated hair.  One of the standout features is its ability to add remarkable shine. After using my hair had an enviable glossy finish that looked like it had just been professionally styled with minimal effort. The shine wasnu2019t greasy or artificial; it had a natural luster that highlighted the health and vitality of my hair. This is a huge plus for clients who want to achieve a salon-quality look at home.  Another positive aspect is the kits scent. It has a subtle, fresh fragrance that lingers just enough to be pleasant without being overpowering. This makes the product enjoyable to use.  In terms of strengthening, I observed a noticeable improvement in hair resilience. My hair felt less brittle and I could feel the strength in my light bangs after the first week of use. Porosity appeared better as well. This shows olaplexes ability to enhance the hairu2019s structural integrity. For those with fragile or damaged hair, this kit is an excellent choice to help restore strength and vitality."

I think any haircare fanatic would be happy to get this as a gift. The box makes it look super fancy. I like that the full size bottles don't waste plastic. What you see is what you get and the bottles easily allow you to squeeze out the product. The scent is a light citrus smell and makes me feel like I'm at a high end spa or hair salon. The combination of the hair perfector, shampoo, and conditioner made my hair super soft to the touch and look very healthy and strong. It didn't look frizzy or damaged. I also liked that my hair didn't feel heavy or dirty. Sometimes hair products make you feel like you need to wash everyday and I could tell the difference immediately. I am happy with how only 3 products greatly improved the health of my hair. This review was collected as part of a promotion."

I understand that some bleeding my might still happen for a couple weeks after.  But when I used the shampoo it felt like it made half of my color come out.  I loved the no 3 and the conditioner number 4 . The conditioner isn't too heavy of a conditioner that my hair felt greasy or weighed down.  I love the scent and how clean smelling it leaves the hair and how it smells even after you dry your hair.  The shampoo also made my hair feel like hay until I put the conditioner in and let it set for 5 minutes to get a deep condition.  I know so many people love this set and rave about it . I would say that the bond maintenance set isnt for everyone. I think the conditioner by itself I will continue to use but not the shampoo."

Case in point- the pre shampoo that comes with this set. I would have never thought to purchase something like this on its own, but it makes sense as a bond builder for you hair.   This was my first time using Olaplex shampoo and conditioner. I liked how well the shampoo lathered up, I love me a really good lather. The conditioner seemed to do its job, my hair was fairly easy to brush out after showering.   I didnu2019t notice much of a difference after my first use, but after a few I do think that my hair is a bit stronger and I am experiencing less breakage and fallout.   On a personal note I wish there was more of a scent to the set. I have fairly long thick hair and like my hair products to have a lasting fragrance."

Its distinct smell was off-putting and hard to get used to. Most disappointing, the set didnu2019t address my main concern: hair loss.

I'd rather invest my money in hair/skin/body products that are going to do what they are advertised than waste money on watered down time/money wasting products. What I like about olaplex as a haircare brand is that you can trust them to make products effective and as concentrated as needed for salon-quality results. This kit is essentially a no-brainer because it comes with their no3 hair perfector, as well their full sized shampoo and conditioner! I haven't been using the no3 for very long but what I like about it is that it visibly restores and strengthens your hair from within. My hair felt softer and looked shinier after one use of the no. 3! You use this product on wet hair and rinse out before shampooing. I think my favorite product in the kit has to be the shampoo. I love the smell and how clean it gets your hair while still being hydrating. I always shampoo my hair twice and I loved how clean it go my hair without feeling stripped. I'm going to be honest while I like the conditioner it's probably not my favorite out of the three products. I think because it's a daily conditioner it's just not as deeply moisturizing as say a deep conditioning mask but because it's not supposed to be so for that reason I can't deduct a star. It does what it's supposed to and that's great. I did apply an oleplex leave in product after washing my hair because it's quite coarse/dry so it needs the extra moisture. My ends are feeling very soft and I know in large part it's because of the kit! For those reasons I would recommend this kit!  The review was collected as part of a promotion."

The Olaplex Strong Days Ahead Shampoo and Conditioner Value set is awesome for strengthening your hair. I have been using these products consistently when washing my hair three times per week. The products help my hair shine and feel much softer.    I love that Olaplex product numbers coordinate with which order you use them in your hair. This set is great value for products. A small amount goes a long way to lather in your hair. The conditioner I let stay soaked in my hair for around five minutes, and it was smooth.  This review was collected as part of a promotion."

I've heard such good things about olaplex and have tried a few other products from olaplex and I have been pleased with those. I have tried the no 3 before but didn't currently have any. so the strong days ahead kit comes with the shampoo and conditioner, no four and no five and also the no three , the hair perfector. so you start using this kit by using the number three hair perfector. you saturate your hair from root to tip and let it sit for a bit, at least ten minutes. I let it sit for like thirty minutes. you then get in the shower and use the shampoo, the number four, and then use the conditioner the number five. after continuous use of these products my hair looks so much healthier. this whole line is a bond repair line that actually gets inside your hair to repair bonds, fight frizz and damage and make your hair healthier. my hair definitely feels and looks better, it even styles better which I was curious about when styling it curly but it helped my curls too. I think all hair types can benefit from all three of this products. get this for yourself or as a gift , whoever gets it will love it."

I was definitely excited to try this set aimed to help with that hair issue. And I was impressed by how my hair feels and looks now. It doesn't look softer but it looks fuller and it is so easy to detangle too. It doesn't break like it used to do after using the three products. This set includes the number 3 perfector, the number 4 bond maintenance shampoo and the number 5 bond maintenance conditioner. The perfector is very lightweight and smells good. I applied the product on all my hair. I didn't see too much of a difference because the hair was wet. Then I washed my hair with the shampoo. I only applied shampoo on my roots. This shampoo truly cleans my hair. It lathers nicely and smells so good too. It is very thick and creamy. This means a little bit of product goes a long way. It was like a spa washing session. Then I applied the conditioner on half the hair. The texture is creamy but it is not heavy on the hair. I didn't get a softer feeling but it is good because I need volume. And I can get it with this lightweight conditioner. Plus, it smells so good and fresh. I get cleaner, fuller and stronger hair after using this set. I can always apply some oil for my dry ends. I recommend it to anyone who wants to have stronger and fuller hair. My hair is a little fine, greasy roots, dry scalp, dry ends and straight. And it worked great with my type of hair. I also dye my hair every three or four months. This is why I need more conditioning. This review was collected as part of a promotion."

As far as the conditioner, I only apply this to the bottom half of my hair and mainly focusing on my ends. I tend to grab this more when my hair is feeling extra dry and brittle. Just after one use, it leaves my hair soft and feeling just great and hydrated. The scent smells clean but overall a great conditioner when your hair needs a little extra care and itu2019s even great for all hair types.

Itu2019s my 3 favorites!"

It's so simple to use and you only need to use it once a week. I apply it to damp hair leave it on for 3 minutes and then rinse. I then apply the Olaplex shampoo and cleanse my scalp and hair. This No. 4 shampoo is so thick and luxurious. It's so concentrated that you only need a little bit. I do have more of an oily scalp and I do feel like this shampoo is a little heavy for my scalp and hair if I use it every time I shampoo. My final step is the No. 5 conditioner. This conditioner is also very thick and moisturizing. My hair feels so soft and I use it. I do keep it a couple inches away from my scalp. I leave it on for a few minutes and then rinse. My hair was starting to feel dry and I am so happy that I tried Olaplex."

I donu2019t have a lot of hair damage, so I just used the Hair Perfector once a week as suggested, applying it to damp hair in the shower and letting it sit for a few minutes before fully washing my hair. I followed that up with the Shampoo and Conditioner, which I also use other times I wash my hair during the week without the Hair Perfector. It is a bit hard to tell the difference in my hair with the Hair Perfector, but it has been looking healthy, smooth, and shiny, so I donu2019t have anything negative to say about it. I really like the Shampoo and Conditioner though. They smell great and are a luxuriously thick almost honey-like texture. The shampoo lathers really well, and I feel like my hair requires significantly less of this shampoo and conditioner than it does of other brands. On top of that, I really like how my hair looks and feels after using them. Overall, Iu2019d definitely recommend this set as a great way to try some Olaplex staples for a good price."

All times I let my hair air dry so I could get a full idea of what it would do to my hair. When I used all three products, my hair was shiny, not greasy, less dry than usual, and my split ends looked better. When I skipped the first step, my hair was a bit drier, and my ends looked the same as before I hopped in the shower. The texture of all three products is nice and thick, so I know itu2019s actually coating my hair. Thereu2019s not a distinct smell.

I don't know which one of these miracle products I have to thank, or if it's just the brilliant combination of the three.. but wow my hair feels and looks wonderful!!! It's stronger, volumized, super shiny, and overall more alive!! I was also impressed with how little product you have to use. Less than a dime size amount of shampoo was enough to suds my whole head. All three products also smell really good. The packaging is very minimalist but in a good way. I will definitely be getting it again!!  **This review was collected as part of a promotion."

I am having fun trying different products to find what works best for my hair.  use these products regularly anyway (and love them!) so having them in these handy travel sizes is just perfect. A little goes a long way, so these should last several weekends.love the shampoo and conditioner. The shampoo doesn't dry my hair out and the conditioner seems to be working well. Helping reduce oily hair. Smoother is fantastic for after washing. Makes hair feel very soft and easy to manage.Really great products, had one of the sample sets great value as you don't need to use a lot and helps you decide the best products for your hair without spending too much"

The shampoo is a really good consistency almost like the texture of spun honey and it also smells really good. I have used the hair perfector both before and after the conditioner, and I can honestly say I didnu2019t really notice too much of a difference using it before.  Even after leaving it on my hair for the full 10 minutes. I believe I noticed the biggest difference in texture and moisture of my 2b curly hair using the conditioner, it is a very nice smell and makes my hair feel super hydrated. This is very important because I live in the sunny state of Arizona. I also used this in conjunction with the curl defining gel and my curls have never looked better.  ****This review was collected as part of a promotion."

In additon, it also has a travel size OLAPLEX hair perfector number 3. This is a perfect was to test out the formula, without spending too much. This set truly is a bargain and a true steal. I love the formula of this shampoo and conditioner. It is truly creamy and light and leaves my hair feeling both fresh and silky. The Hair perfector prepares my hair for any hair styling I decide to do. Personally, I think this set can be also a perfect gift for the holidays! The set will truly allow your loved one to have stronger hair days ahead. I also think this set will make more people excited to try more from the OLAPLEX line!"

From the first use, I noticed my hair became bouncier, shinier, and stronger almost instantly. Having used it for over a week now, I must express, as a beauty industry professional and esthetician, my astonishment at the rapidity of the results. The products are highly concentrated, meaning a small amount is sufficient, which is great since I have thick hair. I strongly suggest giving this set a try; it has provided me with remarkable results in such a brief period. Don't hesitate to pick one up before they're all gone u2013 you won't regret it if you're aiming for consistently healthy, light, and fluffy hair!"
