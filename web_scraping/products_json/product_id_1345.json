Described as having the following notes: Neroli, Bitter Orange, Raspberry, Orange Flower Absolute, Sambac Jasmine Absolute, Gardenia, Patchouli, Honey, Amber. I would say the smell is bitter, Gardenia and the Amber stand out but mostly it smells like an old dark woodsy musky scent. Other reviewers mentioned it was long lasting but i found the scent would fade away after 4 hours or so. Unfortuntely I'm not a fan and wouldn't recommend it. I love the idea of the shape being inspired by the regent diamond in the louvre, but it isn't very practical and is awkward to hold."

It could easily be worn on a daily basis and doesn't feel the need to have a special occasion in order to wear it. I don't have a strong nose for all the levels of fragrance that this perfume has, but I can appreciate that there is some depth to the smell. The notes are well balanced. The only thing I can't speak to is the lasting power. I'm a teacher and can't wear perfume to work so I haven't been able to give it a satisfactory wear test. I do love the packaging of this perfume and kind of enjoy the way it lays on the shelf."

I found this fragrance to be very neroli-forward (at least on me). This gives it a very mature smell in my opinion so it's not typically a scent I would go for. However, the intensity of this fragrance really allows for it to fade into a much sweeter scent by the end of the day so I will usually apply a very light layer to my chest and wrists right out of the shower. This is definitely more of a fall/winter scent. It's warm and inviting and seductive. Layering it with a fruitier scent would make it more wearable for the summer/daytime."

The perfume starts out quite strong but dont worry it mellows out into a soft playful scent that can work throughout the day or a light subtle fragrance for the evening. Love the packaging but not a perfume youd take with you on the go. I feel like this scent would suit anyone who wears it and would adapt to the under-notes of your natural scent, my mother tried it and it smelt more woodsy on her however it smelt more fresh and floral on me. Would definitely recommend anyone try this."

My first impression was that it might be unisex because it has a masculine, woody scent. Which makes it mystical and interesant. It is a strong, long lasting smell on its own but not bothering, which i loved.  I feel like it is a perfum to be used in special ocassions only, because for everyday use it would be too 'provocative/seductive' and it would lose its mystery.  It is a scent that turns heads, exactly because you can not smell it everywhere.  They used the description flirty, I think it is more like a serious, grown and intoxicating smell not a fruity or playful one."

Upon first glance, I felt drawn toward the bottle as its unique in design and very eye catching.  Dazzling.  The amber/ gold hue speaks royalty without being tacky.  The in packaging was my favourite part as its so sleek and is wrapped up like the perfect gift.   The scent is seductive, fixed with light florals but fresh.  It is a bit of a mature scent and not something that I would normally purchase, but I found that the scent was appealing.  (I am in my thirties and think someone in their fifties would wear this normally ). I I wish it lasted longer, thats why Im giving this only a four star review and not five.  Reapplication is needed throughout the day.   Overall I think this would make a great gift for someone who is mature, yet bold and knows what they want.  The scent is empowering and displays confidence, while being delicate at the same time.  True femininity.    After receiving the product, I researched the designer a bit and found out some information that I didnt know.  Paco collaborated with a range of iconic fashion houses and designed costumes for films. Rabanne was also the recipient of several awards, including the Legion of Honour, which recognised his contributions to the arts and fashion. He was iconic and broke out in the 1960s and made his debut of fashion and world renowned fragrances.  Simply iconic.  Happy to have received this gift.   Thank you."

If I had to describe the scent, id say its a sweetish floral and perfect for people who gravitate towards Chanel or Dior or specifically for me, I think this gives off the same mature girlie vibe as Jo Malone - Rose and Peony which is also kind of on the strong side. So for those who like a more subtle scent, this prrfume may not be for you. This scent lasted a full day for me however it did slowly start to get weaker at the 4-6 hour mark, but it is definitely longer lasting than most!

I personally wouldnt say that it fades as you shouldnt have to reapply this throughout the day but it becomes less overwhelming and a much more enjoyable scent. The bottle feels and looks nice and unique which could definitely be a statement piece in someone collection.

When I first sprayed it, the sweet honey and orange blossom was a bit overpowering for my taste and I was worried that it would be too sweet. Honestly, I didnt like it during the initial spray, but once it settled and developed with my body chemistry, Ive come to like it much more. Its fresh, floral, feminine, clean, and warm. The honey is the main sweet note at first, but over time I was able to smell the hints of raspberry and lemon. The patchouli really rounds it out to give off a more mature vibe.   The perfume lasts quite long on me (8-10 hours) with a good projection and without being too overpowering. The one thing that I dont like is the packaging. The lightweight material they use for the top of the bottle ruins the experience and classiness of the bottle in my opinion. I wish it was a heavier material, like the bottom. The perfume also doesnt sit upright, but thats not a huge issue for me.  Its not a groundbreaking fragrance, but its one that is timeless and wont go out of style. If you love white florals and clean musk, this is a good bet. Overall, Ive really enjoyed this fragrance! It will definitely be in my rotation for nights out and as the weather gets colder."

It gives off a really war, floral smell with a great undertone of patchouli. Be prepared though, this is a strong perfume. One spray should last you a while. I will say this probably will not be an everyday perfume because it is really strong. It will however be great for those special occasions!   *I did receive this product in exchange for my honest review."
