    "about": "Fragrance Family:Florals.Scent Type:Warm Florals.Key Notes:Jasmine, Amber, Moss.Fragrance Description:Paradoxe Intense Eau de Parfum takes the original perfume and turns it up ever so slightly. Jasmine, Ambrofix, and moss blend together to create a floral and amber-y signature scent that explores a femininity that is both powerful and delicate..About the Bottle:This perfume bottle is an expression of the Houseu2019s essence of reinvention and predilection for contrasts. In a shift from the traditional perfume bottle architecture, the flacon is minimal and delicate at first glance, inspired by the original, iconic Prada triangle logo, disruptively designed to rest on its side. The Prada coat of arms logo contrasts with the deep pink color of the fragrance. The bottle is finished with u2018Paradoxe Intenseu2019 on its top chamfer..About the Fragrance:This feminine, floral perfume for women is an invitation to explore and express the paradoxical multidimensions of women. Experience the celebration of self-expression and the liberation that comes with being never the same, always yourself.",
    "ingredients": "Alcohol, Parfum/Fragrance, Aqua/Water/Eau, Linalool, Benzyl Salicylate, Limonene, Benzyl Alcohol, Hydroxycitronellal, Ethylhexyl Salicylate, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Coumarin, Methyl Anthranilate, Citronellol, Geraniol, Citral, Tris(Tetramethylhydroxypiperidinol) Citrate, Benzyl Benzoate, Ci 14700/Red 4, Ci 17200/Red 33.",
    "how_to_use": "Suggested Usage:.-Fragrance is intensified by the warmth of your own body. Apply in the creases of your knees and elbows for a longer-lasting, stronger scent.&nbsp;.-After applying, avoid rubbing or dabbing skin. This breaks down the fragrance, causing it to wear off more quickly.&nbsp;.-If you prefer placing fragrance on your wrists, be sure to reapply after frequent handwashing, as this tends to rinse off the scent.&nbsp;.-Replace fragrance after 12 months. Expired perfumes more than a year old lose the integrity of the original scent...Eau de Toilette or Eau de Parfum?: .The difference lies in the volume of perfume oil. While EDT contains five to nine percent, EDP contains more, usually eight to 14 percent. EDPs, therefore, last longer and smell more intense.",
