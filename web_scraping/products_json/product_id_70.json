I canu2019t say definitively that this product caused the pimples, but it certainly didnu2019t prevent them or get rid of them quickly, and it had no other noticeable results. At this price, I have no plans to give it more time. Texture is nice ($50 nice, not $500 nice), and packaging is beautiful. Not for me."

First, AB uses ECOCERT/COSMOS certified glass. The fact is that even the purest skincare products can fall victim to chemicals leached from plastic containers, meaning that not only the skincare product, but harmful chemicals such as Biphisenol A are applied directly to the skin. Iu2019ll gladly pay more for glass. Second, AB uses safe and clean ingredients. Go ahead and download the Yuka app, pay the $8/year so you can search for products, then search for this serum. It rated 100/100 and is excellent quality. Then search for the serum youu2019re currently using, see where it stands next to this one. The sad thing is not even all u201ccleanu201d brands rank 100/100. And a lot of high end brands, such as La Mer, rank 0/100 and contain hazardous ingredients. The bottom line, with consistent use you will reap the benefits of using AB products."

For the price tag, you get 1 oz in an airless pump that sits in an aluminum case which sits in a metal sleeve in a glass vase base. Fragile packing. The reason is that the product can be refilled. The product with the pump can be replaced for another one that sits inside the aluminum case. Kind of unnecessary.  I do like the airless pump. I used this every night on one side of my face after my actives and layered moisturizer on top for 4 weeks. It's supposed to do everything. Hydrate, plump, less wrinkles, less pigmentation, smooth, brighten. I do see a minor difference. Not drastic enough that one side of my face looks different than the other. But my before and after photos looks slightly better. A little bit smoother and less pigmentation.  The examples on the website are very slight as well. There's a lot of plant extracts and squalene as ingredients. Nothing in the ingredients look too revolutionary. It is unscented, spreads well, and lightweight. Per the website, it only lasts 2-3 months! It's nice to see a product that slightly works, but very few can afford to drop $350 every 3 months. I will definitely continue to use it, but will find it hard to recommend based on the price tag alone."

The packaging is a bit excessive. It is in a aluminum container, in a glass holder. You can take the piece out of the glass holder and repurpose it for makeup brushes or something. I did like that you can see where you are at in the container abs how much you have left.  u2022I did not notice this doing anything for me. I am half ways through my bottle and havenu2019t seen a change in my skin.  -For the price point, this didnu2019t seem any better than the $30 serums I have used.  There is a lot of science backed behind this but for me, I do not have the issues. It is supposed to help with skin hydration, hyperpigmentation, aging skin, and skin firmness. These are not concerns of mine so it is hard to give a review on them.  u2022Prosu2014no scent! Very lightweight and doesnu2019t leave a feeling on my skin. Not greasy at all.

My pump was a bit faulty and it had hard time getting out the product onto my fingers.  So there is no scent or fragrance to the serum and when you apply it onto your cleansed face it is not greasy and pretty light but it takes a significant amount of time to dry or absorb into your skin and then it forms this transparent film that after a while you can roll off your skin and just take it off almost like a tiny mask.  The quality of product I think is pretty good because I feel like there was improvement in my skinu2019s texture, it became smoother and softer and more hydrated. So it was noticeable for me personally.  Not sure if I would recommend this product that has so little of it plus barely stands upright without tilting over due to its design. So the design is definitely high end and luxurious but it is not practical. Iu2019d love to have this product in a more practical container. I wish it had a scent and dried quicker and without the film like residue. Iu2019ll keep using it but I doubt I will buy it in the future.  Thank You Influenster for letting me try it"

All of these are good things, but for $375 and the major reputation of Augustinus Bader, I felt a little underwhelmed. A regular drug store serum could probably do the same?   After about 6 weeks of continued use once a day, I happen to go into my injectoru2019s office where they take makeupless u201cbeforeu201d photos at every single appointment. She pulled up a photo from last summer (pre serum use) and compared it to the current photo of me from that day. I WAS IN SHOCK. My new photo showed even, calm skin.

Now talking about price x efficiency: I would recommend buying it only if you use other products of the same brand because I believe they work better together, otherwise I believe you can find good creams at more affordable prices and a better efficiency if use by itself.

This does not have a scent at all - it sinks into your skin almost immediately and it does not leave behind a tacky or filmy feeling that some serums can do.  With such a bougie price point the effectiveness is going to be in the limelight.  To help support its claims the serum has a lot of science that backs its performance.  Once you look at consumer thoughts so far there is a a varying with the majority of leaning on the happy side.  As for me - my skin did feel better after thirty days - I waited so long to write my review as I wanted to squeeze the last drop out prior to giving all of my thoughts - I wanted my review to encompass down the last drop - you knew I was going to add in some coffee humor!  My skin, without makeup, looked radiant, pores appeared smaller, there was a firmness in areas that were not as firm prior to using.  With that said, I do feel that there are other products on the AB line that share the same ingredients with a less expensive price point and/or other products in your fave skincare lines that are not as BOUGIE that would give the same results - I am about to start trying one out to see if there really does appear to be a better version for those of us that want to keep about $325 in our pocket book!"

My face is feeling so much softer, I am currently breakout free, and those pesky lines have definitely softened. I CAN'T be 100% sure if it's this serum or the discontinuation of tret that has given my face back its UMPH, maybe a combinatiom of both? But it has not caused me any adverse effects and the ingredient lineup is wonderful. At the end of the day I would love to continue using this as a long term aid for anti-aging.

The serum is absorbed instantly!  After absorption, there is no sticky or film-like feeling.  Moisturizes well, there were no rashes and clogged pores.  The skin remains moisturized until the evening, when applied under the eyes at night, no swelling or other troubles were noticed.  I use it after tonic before applying cream.  After applying it, the skin becomes like silk.  Indeed, the skin after the serum became smooth, toned, the complexion became fresh and healthy.  Expression lines are noticeably smaller.

It doesn't seem to have a scent which is good for skincare and has a nice texture that dries and doesn't leave you sticky. On mornings where I used this serum by itself the evening before my skin is really nice and soft. When I add this serum to my routine with some of my other skincare items like my Niacinamide lotion my skin was super soft and glowy, almost like it's happy. I can't say this worked miracles, I saw no change in any of my skin issues, and no help with any lines or skin texture in the long run, but if you don't expect miracles this is a very nice serum. After about five weeks of use (2 pumps covers my face and neck easily) it's still going strong but impossible to tell how much of the 1oz tube I've used because it's a heavy tube and not see through.  The packaging for this item is luxurious!! It's a metal tube but it sits in this beautiful blue glass canister that looks so gorgeous on your counter/vanity that people will definitely ask about it."

And I'm very grateful to be able to try it! But does it actually work?  The serum itself is super creamy if that makes sense. It absorbs very quickly into the skin! I've been using it for almost 3 weeks now, and I can see a difference in my skin! It's definitely firmer. And my laugh lines have diminished slightly. I'm excited to see more results with further use! You only need a little bit. Very easy to apply.  The only thing I can say that I'm a little bit disappointed in is the price. A 1 oz bottle as you see here in the picture will set you back $375 . I say if you have the money and you can spend it on this product, definitely go for it!"

This serum works well with all of my other skin care products, both high end and drugstore.  The price is a bit steep.  I currently use one pump twice a day (morning and night) so I will have to see how long it lasts to tell if it would be cost effective to repurchase.  I am very happy with the results and will continue to use it until I finish my current tube.  I am glad to see that you can repurchase just the serum insert rather than the entire container as this helps to reduce waste. Overall a wonderful and effective serum from a trusted and reputable brand."

Iu2019ve been using this product 3-4x a week for about a month and itu2019s been lovely!  My skin feels soooo bouncy, supple, and soft. It almost looks like I have a filter on; let me also add that i use exfoliants but this product has elevated my skincare routine.   This product does not contain fragrance but has a slightly faint medicinal scent; the scent does not bother me nor does it last long just thought to call that out.   The amount of product that you get for this price is unjust. The packaging is BEAUTIFUL and HUGE so when I received it, I thought there was at least 4oz to work with- instead the 1oz vial sits in a vessel. I understand thatu2019s to help the vial stand u2026 and could probably be repurposedu2026but AB couldu2019ve made the serum itself with a flat bottom. It makes me wonder if this almost $400 price tag is for the packaging and packaging alone.   Overall, if you love AB products Iu2019m sure this is in your wheelhouse, I recommend purchasing. If youu2019re looking to splurge, I recommend purchasing. You donu2019t absolutely need this product but itu2019s nice to have! Am I currently contemplating spending my own money for this? Yes, yes I am. And will more than likely close my eyes and make that purchase when the time comes because I feel like it has completed my routine!"

I started living my skin back. Even i see great improvement in my freckles-and  pores too. My skin look healthy and has glow in it.

My face does for sure feels soft and I was nervous putting it on with my breakout would inflame my pimple, as other products have, but it did not cause irriation to my pimple. For me, 1 pump was plenty of product. The product was 1 oz, so the holder is a little bigger that the actual product, and since it's a metallic structure, you can also make it cold and place the bottle on your face to reduce puffiness.

            "review_text": "First things first..  this packaging made me feel like part of the 1%. I opened the box and felt like if been transported to Victoria Beckhams bathroom. It makes my bathroom look nicer just sitting on the counter. I'll keep it there forever, I even bought a shower curtain to match it lol. Now the product itself-a little goes a long way-as it should for that price. The first morning after my first use I immediately noticed a difference. My fine lines looked more plump and less visible. My skin tone looked more even which is great for me because I never have time for foundation. All in all if say it's a wonderful product. Now I've never tried a $300-400 serum before so as far as price point goes I have absolutely nothing to compare it to, but I suppose it's true what they say...you get what you pay for.  Use his card and splurge sis."

My skin is smoother, more even toned, my pores have shrunk, acne has significantly decreased and fine lines and wrinkles aren't even visible anymore. A little pump goes a long way. It doesn't leave my skin oily like other serums, but instead leaves it nice and moisturized.  I've had people compliment on how my skin looks since I've started using this."

However, I feel that it is over the top and super heavy while the product inside the blue glass is a fraction of it. It works amazing though, it is hydrating and feel great on my skin. When I use it, I feel like a million bucks."

I started using this product 3 weeks ago and immediately after the first application I noticed a difference in my skinu2019s overall texture and suppleness. This serum is like a drink for my skin and my fine lines seem to disappear right after application. No other product that Iu2019ve tried has done this for my skin (not even La Mer!) Within 3 weeks, my skin had visibly decreased fine lines and looked healthier and brighter! I absolutely love using this serum since it doesnu2019t have that sticky feeling after application. My skin feels smoother and refreshed and is now a staple in my pre bed routine. You need this in your life if you want to get rid of those pesky fine lines!"
