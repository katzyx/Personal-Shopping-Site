    "about": "Fragrance Family:Warm & Spicy.Scent Type:Woody Spices.Key Notes:Oud, Bushman Candle, Skin Musk.Fragrance Description:This unisex perfume is the culmination of smokey darkness contrasted by an airy lightness. The intoxicating dark appeal of oud softened by whispers of light florals and an underlying creamy sweetness creates an exotic fragrance experience that is confident but never overpowering..About the Bottle:CLEAN RESERVE cares about the health of the planet. Working with vendors who use green manufacturing processes and minimizing the amount of waste produced by the packaging is of paramount importance. The cap is made of sustainable wood from Spain. The corn-derived cellophane is biodegradable and compostable..About the Fragrance:Sueded Oud is made with sustainable Bushman\u2019s Candle from Namibia. Using Bushman\u2019s Candle supports the nomadic Himba tribe\u2019s economic development and preservation of their traditional way of life. It is crafted with the people and planet in mind and is always cruelty-free, vegan, gluten-free and phthalate-free.",
    "ingredients": "Alcohol Denat., Fragrance, Water, Glycerin, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Phenoxyethanol, Limonene, Citronellol, Linalool, Eugenol...The list of ingredients is subject to change, please consult the packaging of the product purchased.",
    "how_to_use": "Suggested Usage:.-Fragrance is intensified by the warmth of your own body. Apply in the creases of your knees and elbows for a longer-lasting, stronger scent.&nbsp;.-After applying, avoid rubbing or dabbing skin. This breaks down the fragrance, causing it to wear off more quickly.&nbsp;.-If you prefer placing fragrance on your wrists, be sure to reapply after frequent hand-washing, as this tends to rinse off the scent.&nbsp;.-Replace fragrance after 12 months. Expired perfumes more than a year old lose the integrity of the original scent... Eau de Toilette or Eau de Parfum?: .The difference lies in the volume of perfume oil. While EDT contains five to nine percent, EDP contains more, usually eight to 14 percent. EDPs, therefore, last longer and smell more intense.",

I know people are saying it doesn't last long. it doesn't last as long if you're directly spraying onto the skin. I spray both my skin and clothes. better longevity on clothes for sure. but I do get several hours of wear directly on my skin."

            "review_text": "Once again I am left disappointed by a clean fragrance. The scent is so light.  134$ is not cheap to be spraying this so generously just to barely smell it and only for it to fade to nothing so quickly (less than an hour) The review below me says this lasts a long time. It's not because I'm going nose blind if I can hardly smell it right after spraying it and it has a strong alcohol smell at first. Some bottles are good and some are weak. I've bought 7 clean fragrances and only one bottle was actually strong. Out of those 7, I bought 2 bottles of the same scent and one bottle was very strong and the other very weak. This is the issue I'm having with clean fragrance and can get no answers from companies as to why or even acknowledge this issue.  Other than that the fragrance is very hard to describe. It's sweeter than I expected, not as earthy/woody. It's nice but because of the weakness it will have to return."

My husband always tell me to always wear this perfume as he finds it very simple but attractive at the same time. I have gotten lots of compliments  with this perfume. As a hotel front desk agent, I cannot wear overbearing scents, this one is perfect for my work place, despite of having a glass pannel between myself and our hotel guests, the scent still manages to get through and our guests always asks what scent I'm wearing. The best part is, it lasts long! I'll spray 2 sprays on my uniform and 2 on my wrists then I'll tap it on my neck, by the end of my 8hrs shift, it's still there. For me, it really is worth it."

This is a beautiful formulation of this scent. Clean has done a great job marrying oud with sweet notes and florals here, while still having the oud be the star of the show. This is one of the few oud-centered fragrances I would be comfortable wearing to work because of it's subtly. It also lasted really well on my skin, although I know some other reviewers got less mileage out of it. If you like woodsy scents or are looking for a wearable version of oud, this is a really great one to try."

He spends an hour on the body wash aisle picking out the perfect body wash each time because it MUST SMELL RIGHT or he wont bathe with it. take it from me...hes picky.

At first sniff I wasn't too sure I liked it. It opened up with a sharp (pimento?), raw, dirty sex (musk? incense?) smell.   Within 10 minutes it softened and I began to smell cypress, fir, and oud. That's when I became hooked.   It only took another 10 minutes or so before suede and amber began to mingle with the cypress, fir, oud, musk, and incense.   Within a few minutes magnolia and honeysuckle blossoms added to the chorus.   Now, over 2 hours in, I'm smelling a hint of jasmine, quite a bit of frankincense, and a touch of sophisticated patchouli - but, I can still smell all the other notes. As it develops, the top notes don't give way to the middle notes, which don't step aside for the base notes. This is a fragrance that keeps building on itself. It's a bewildering, unconventional, labyrinthine scent. I don't think this is a scent everyone will fancy.   On me, Sueded Oud has moderate bordering on heavy sillage. I've now been wearing it for about 2 1/2 hours and although it's fading, I can still smell it, so unfortunately I don't think it's got the greatest longevity."

I love that beyond the woodsy, musky scents, you'll find the sweet and soothing florals.   I love perfumes and scents in general, and would have to say this one is not as strong or overwhelming as others I've tried recently. I can see this requiring some touch up over hours of time or if you're up against a crowd. For me though, it is perfect as is. I'd much rather have a scent be an extension of yourself instead of enveloping the room.  Value: The best advice is to always try a sample of a scent before committing. The pricing seems appropriate, and at least if you decide to move on from this, you know you can pass it on to any gendered individual with no fuss."

The price point seems steep but if you compare it to Tom Ford or the Juliette has a gun line - it's actually a steal because it's a pretty big bottle. It's pretty much a staple for me.

Since longevity tends to depend on your body chemistry, here's some info on me: sweets tend to turn super sweet on me, citrus becomes overpowering, and they'll last forever on me.  Unfortunately, I like neither citrus nor sweet scents, but I have found woodsy/oriental fragrances that last for ages on me.  This is unfortunately not one of them. I would recommend this to someone who wants to dip a toe into the magical world of oud fragrances.  There's a reason why oud has been a popular scent for hundreds of years - it's amazing when done right.  Try this if the two Juliette Has a Gun ouds that Sephora carries are simply too overpowering for you.  I wish I could give this a higher rating, but it simply didn't work with my body chemistry."

Another review said the scent wore off quickly but I have worn the perfume multiple times and still smell the scent on my skin after 8 hours + so it may be a difference in skin types. Very pleased with the perfume and definitely recommend for fragrance lovers of light, fresh with wood undertones."

There are so many layers to it (as you can see form the notes list), but they blend magically together. It's a strong, unique scent. The incense is heavy (why I love this), so if you're not a fan of a strong, heady smell like incense, you may not like this. This scent just feels completely warm. Definitely a nighttime scent, but I'm planning on wearing it all the time. Length of scent is good too!"

It doesn't last all day, but it's so worth it. I find it to be very fresh and great for the spring/summer. I am in love with it."

It's a crisp, sweet and clean modern oud. This is definitely a mild scent, but nonetheless I really enjoyed it. Unfortunately it completely faded after a few hours."
