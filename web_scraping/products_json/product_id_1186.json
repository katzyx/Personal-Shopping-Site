I have to dab inside the cap with a small makeup brush to use this, otherwise it'd be trashed. Might not purchase any more colors in the stix, simply because this situation isn't a fun makeup experience."

It will look perfect with clothing colors like rust, olive, turquoise, peach, coral, celeste, lilac, black, navy and cream. I'd probably avoid it with dark red, dark purple, fuchsia, mustard, yellows or dark green but never say never!

But when I lifted off the cap, I found that the cream blush itself was STUCK to the inside of the cap! It was totally disconnected from the body of the tube. See pic below. Although I can press it back in the tube, it is not firmly seated and will likely fall out again. For the price, that's ridiculous. The Nars multi-stick is larger, and superior in terms of quality. Very disappointing, I do not recommend based on the low quality."

While the bristles themselves are soft, they're short so you can't really use them to blend the color onto your skin. So I have to use a stippling motion to buff out the color which can turn out a little patchy.  I think you're better off just using your fingers. I chose Nude Buff because I wanted a color that goes with both warm and cool tones and it was a great neutral pick. The packaging was confusing...Nude Buff is listed under the Satin Finish colors but the tube says it's Nudies Matte (FYI, the finish is in between satin and matte). I'm also not a fan of the metal tin because the mirror inside is a little warped and mine came with some white powder residue inside. I'm still alive so I'm going to guess it's face powder but definitely makes me wonder about their quality control.  Packaging - The Nude Buff listed as satin finish but says matte on the tube"

I have the shade Naughty n' Spice, which I think is a really beautiful neutral pink that can work for a natural, 'no makeup' makeup look, or for something more glam. I also think it's suitable for a wide range of skin tones - I personally have fair skin, and it works well. You can wear this directly on bare, moisturized skin, or you can apply on top of foundation. The product applies smoothly without feeling sticky or waxy. I also really like the packaging, because the included brush is perfect for blending out the blush. Overall, I am a huge fan of this product and would both repurchase and recommend to a friend!"

Iu2019ve been into cream blushes for a while now and have tried quite a few, from liquid to creams, and this one lands somewhere in the top 10. Gorgeous dusty nose nude shade that would work on plenty of skin tones. Can be used as an everyday shade -works with both cool and warm tone looks. I like to apply the cream on my palm, work it in with a brush a little, then apply to my face, so that it doesnu2019t deposit too much product on my cheeks and remains manageable. Formula is creamy but not slippery. Blends out to a soft matte finish. I feel like it could be a touch more blendable if Iu2019m being picky but it is a matte blush so it makes sense. This blush stick is marketed to be used on the eyes, lips, and cheeks however I always thought that concept was silly, mainly use it on my checks and sometimes, in a rush, Iu2019ll throw some on my eyelids for a monochromatic look. It has two ends, one with the blush, one with a mini brush to blend it out. I think itu2019s a little gimmicky to be honest, Iu2019ve tried to use it once but itu2019s just far too small and takes forever to blend, so I prefer to use a full cheek brush. Overall, I really like this product and have always wanted to try Nude Stix and Iu2019m impressed. Not my absolute favorite but beautiful nonetheless!"

I took off one star because Nudestix blushes are not quite as long lasting as some of my other blushes. Even setting with powder I find that they disappear after ~6 hours, whereas my other blushes last me all day (and this is for someone with dry skin-- I imagine for oily skin girlies they'd disappear even faster)."

First impressions for this blush were that it was a little brighter in color than I expected and quite pigmented. The blush was creamy and easy to apply and diffuse. The staying power was good but the intensity of color fades quickly on bare skin without powder. The color is still noticeable but less saturated after ~2 hours, and stays for most of the work day in the office when on top of foundation and set with powder. On my skin tone the color was closer to a coral pink than a rosy pink.  Overall, I thought the product was really nice and convenient, but I wasnu2019t sure if it would work for someone like me since I prefer muted colors and have fairly light skin.  I played around with it and I found that it was really pretty and soft when I layered my setting powder with it (Essence Brighten Up! Banana Powder). The blush and powder played nicely with each other and did not have any weird texture/cakiness even with multiple layers of powder.  My preferred way to apply this blush is to just tap light dots around where I want the center of my blush to be and then use the brush to make light and very short tapping strokes. I find that this helps to spread the blush nicely without moving my foundation although I did not notice the blush moving my foundation even when using longer strokes. I then will sweep a thin layer of setting powder on top of the blush to soften the color and set it. If I want the color to be less saturated and softer, I will layer more powder until I am happy with it.  I also really like the brush on the other end! Itu2019s pretty soft and doesnu2019t scratch my sensitive skin, and the cap keeps the bristles protected and my makeup bag clean. The only concern I have is I am not sure how I am going to clean it."

The blush is quite smooth and creamy, goes on easy and stays on through the day.  I have sensitive skin that likes to breakout with new and products with junk ingredients. So I had to give this a few weeks to see if my skin would reject it and I was pleasantly surprised I didnu2019t see a hint of a breakout.  I received this item for free in exchange for an honest review which makes it even more surprising that the shade was such a good match. I am not a big blush girl but I am so happy to have this in my arsenal and will be getting another when this one runs out."

It looked like it would be before I put it on my face but when I did, it looked a little to pale for me.

You can use fingertips to blend or the brush that is the opposite end of the tube. No need to carry extra make-up tools. I have tried a few other products like this but this one is the best. Great formula and the color looked great on my slightly olive skin tone. I also like the clean ingredients and that it has antioxidents so it is also good for your skin.

I also LOVED this for my lips, I  wasn't expecting it to be something I would use other than for blush but it seemed to seep into my lips and really made it look like my lip color rather than something on my lips.  Another great product from Nudestix."

I wear makeup quite regularly and have known of the Nudestix brand but had never tried it before today.  I have used cream blushes in the past. I received the color Nude Buff which is a very charming color and would work for many skin tones. It is a buildable color and blends beautifully. I did wear it with a medium coverage foundation with Serum built in it so I already had a Dewey finish. Even applying Nudestix with the Serum texture on my face, it applied well and the lovely brush on the end did a nice job on blending it without compromising the foundation underneath.  The packaging is cute. I like the brush on the one end. It feels quality. The metal container the Nudestix comes in also has a mirror under the lid which is a really pleasant surprise."

Im super thankful and after having tried the product, I'm genuinely impressed! The formula is really smooth and blends effortlessly onto the skin, giving a natural finish. The brush that comes with the Blush is really convenient and the bristles are super soft.   The color Nude Buff is versatile and adds a subtle warmth to my complexion without looking overpowering. What I love most is the buildable nature of the product u2013 whether you prefer a subtle hint of color or a more intense flush, this blush allows for easy layering.  The texture is creamy and hydrating, making it a dream to apply. It doesn't cling to dry patches and feels weightless on the skin. The long-lasting formula is a game-changer for me; it stays put throughout the day, maintaining that healthy, dewy glow.  The packaging is also practical and travel-friendly, with a convenient twist-up design. Overall, the Nudies Cream Blush has become a staple in my makeup routine, and I genuinely appreciate the opportunity to experience such a high-quality product."

However, today (less than a month into using this product) I opened the cap again to find it completely fallen out of the stick and smashed into the cap. Itu2019s ruined.   I have been storing it normally in a small makeup bag on my bathroom shelf. My apartment is temperature controlled. I have not moved it from my bathroom. Sad to say, but it must be the packaging.   Separately, the applicator brush isnu2019t worth much. I assume itu2019s a means of providing less product relative to the visual length of the tube. I used it only once and the result was just a messy brush (I redid the application at the time with my own sponge).

I carry it in my purse and am now buying 2 so I can have one in my main makeup kit too.  They should pay me for all the people I've told about this. I will reapply in front of girlfriends and they gasp like it's a makeover reveal. This might be more about what color does for me, but I really felt like his product did the job. I go from half dead to alive.  My one problem with it is that the smell of the actual product is a little chemically. I didn't have problems with a smell on the brush like I'd seen some reviewers say.

I have been gifted the nudies matte sun-kissed pink from Bzzagent. This is my first review for them.  I honestly do prefer the regular nudies matte formula, i just wish the product was a tad more on the creamy side without the dew. I'm getting older (30), and I don't particularly enjoy the tugging I have to endure to blend it out.  I really dislike the brush attached to the componet. I also dislike the brush from the makeup by mario blush componet, too. I just use the sephora pro blush brush for all my cream blushes.  I never wear pink blushes, but there's just something about the sun-kissed pink shade that flatters me. It's very similar to the natural flush in my cheeks.  I'm tickled pink that I got this gifted to me because I would have never tried this shade out.  When I bought the dolce darlin shade, i was initially upset by the size. I do believe it has around the same amount of product from makeup by mario, just way smaller, which I like. It takes up less space.  I wish instead of the brush they have us more product, also get rid of the tin. The brush and tin have to take up a good chunk of the price. It's unnecessary.  All that said, it's my go-to blushes. Over my fenty and make up by mario. I love them all, don't get me wrong, but I use my nudies more.  Thanks, Bzzagent!"

Itu2019s very creamy and buttery, so itu2019s easy to spread out with the warmth of my fingers. I like to u201cstampu201d it on so I donu2019t rush moving my foundation underneath. Great size to keep in my on-the-go makeup bag, or to save space in general!

In this case you can apply it directly to your cheeks and either use your fingers or the brush attached. A little really goes a long way and I can see this product lasting for a long time. I'm on the darker side and it's so flattering on me! My first thought was that I was worried that it would look chalky on my skin but it looks natural but you can layer it as well to make it a deeper red. I can definitely see that this blush will last a long time and I'm happy with how it looks on me."

Iu2019m not so good at blending with the brush (maybe some directions for the fancy make up challenged would be helpful?) I used my fingers to blend it and worked well then used the brush to blend where I didnu2019t want it as noticeable. It feels great on the skin, weightless. Itu2019s not sticky or shinny, the matte finish helps to blend well on the skin.

Was a nice orangey red colour on my lips but pretty patchy and I donu2019t think would work for all day use as lipstick.

The case itself also has a mirror inside which, when paired with the brush, makes it great for applying on the go. I applied it in the morning before a long day of cardio and it looked the same on my face at the end of the night which was great. I have the hot fire shade which seemed a little intimidating at first because I have very fair skin, but once blended it turned into a lovely and very natural sun-kissed look. I also love that you can apply it to the lips and eyelids for an all-around rosy look."

The Sunkissed Pink shade has a silky-smooth application and gives me that fabulous gorgeously glowing and healthy flush of cheek-popping color. I love that I can also use the Nudies matte blush stick as a lip color for a monochromatic look on days I do not like wearing a lot of makeup.

It surpasses many other blushes I have used, both in terms of its formulation and convenience. One of the standout benefits of owning this product is its ease of use. The stick format makes it incredibly convenient and mess-free. You can simply swipe it directly onto your cheeks and blend it out with your fingertips. It eliminates the need for brushes or applicators, making it perfect for quick touch-ups on the go. The compact packaging is also travel-friendly, allowing you to achieve a fresh and radiant look wherever you are. As for whether I would buy this product, I would definitely consider repurchasing the Nudestix NUDIES BLUSH STICK - Sunkissed Pink. Its high quality, ease of use, and long-lasting wear make it a worthwhile investment. The shade range offered by Nudestix also provides options for various skin tones and preferences. In terms of recommendation, I would absolutely recommend this product to my friends"

It applies very creamy and easy to blend into the skin and is as advertised, soft and matte. The colour applies with the slightest touch onto the lips or skin so it can be built up for more colour. I have slightly oily skin and ontop of moisturizer, this blush glides easily but I could see it being a bit sticky for dry skin. I used my fingers to blend the blush into my cheeks. The product screws up from the top of the stick and the bottom has a small compact stippling brush with a lid. I loved the packaging but the tin box seems unnecessary (except for the mirror on the inside of the lid) since the product is fully contained on its own. They could have put little mirrors on the top or bottom lids of the product. I'll be using the cute case for a completely different purpose."

The product comes in cute black packaging that exudes sleekness, making it perfect for travel. However, I did encounter a minor issue. The texture of the blush is slightly sticky, which makes it a bit challenging to spread evenly on the skin. Personally, I feel it works better as lipstick rather than a blush. Nonetheless, the color and the packaging are undeniably attractive, making Nudestix a brand worth exploring."

I then proceeded to use it as a blush it blends very well. However, it made me look like I had a slight sunburn on my cheeks. So needless to say I will not use it as a blush, but I will definitely use it as a lipstick, and I would buy it again as a lip product for myself because I really love the color."

Being able to use it all over my face was a huge seller for me as I am a very natural make up type person. It's dual ended with a soft stippling brush on one end and the creamy, buildable pigment on the other. Whether using a little or a lot, it seems to melt into the skin and work with your own colouring to be flattering and customizable. There's also a mirror in the lid, which makes it perfect for on the go! It's vegan, cruelty free, gluten free, and has no parabens, sulphates, pthalates, or frangances. I love that they are female founded and am looking forward to using it on a regular basis"

This shade is a beautiful flush of pink that applies and blends into the skin so easily, giving that your skin but better look that Nudestix strives for. I tried out this product everyday for 1 week and I was looking to see how easily it went on, how natural the shade looked, and how long it lasted throughout the day. I can honestly say that I applied product this in the morning before work, worked 9 hours, then worked out and still saw that nice rosy flush at the end of the day. What's even more important to me is that I have very sensitive, acne prone skin so I am always looking for products that do not clog my pores and break me out. Nudestix is one of the few brands that fits the bill on this for me and this shade did not disappoint on that front either. I often gift Nudestix products to family and friends and will definitely be gifting this shade moving forward."

With the Nudies Matte blush, one good application on my cheekbones is more than enough. I am obsessed with this shade because it compliments well with my brown colored skin. It has a brush at the bottom which is very convenient. And the blush stick comes inside a Nudestix container/box that has a built-in mirror on the inside.

You lose a little bit of the initial glow of the Nudestix as the day goes on, but otherwise color is remarkably consistent for the most part. I have dry skin, am in my early 30s, and some liquid/cream products really do emphasize texture on me, but this really doesn't. Also the application is quite sanitary; if I use it when I'm sick, I cut off a wee little bit of the top. Also, for clean beauty, it hasn't turned in over 1 year since I've had em, and that's stellar. 10000/10 would rebuy!"

Cons: - Maybe itu2019s just my skin, but even with a bunch of setting spray, the pigment didnu2019t last! :(  - A lot of it goes away on the brush once you brush it in, and as someone who LOOOOOVES that blushy peachy look, it felt like I had to apply multiple the product multiple times before getting to that stage. - Looked way better on my cheeks than on my lips, but again, might just be a me thing.

I'm really pale and it's hard to find a shade that looks good on me and not unnatural or clown like.  This Nudies Matte Lux Blush in the shade Rosy Posy looks soooo good on me. I'm in love with it! The formula goes on nice and creamy before drying down to powder and this makes it really easy to blend and control the intensity of the colour. You can apply it directly to your face but I like to apply it using my index and middle fingers and tapping it onto my cheeks. I like that it can be used all over the face including the eyes and lips. This is a great lip colour as well but I wish it had a little extra staying power on my lips. It would be great if they made a liquid lipstick in this shade. The little tin it comes in is very smart and ecofriendly; the mirror inside is great for touchups and the tin prevents the blush stick from getting crushed in your purse so you don't have to worry about the product going everywhere if the lid popped off. I love that its made with clean ingredients, vegan and cruelty free. Going forward this is the blush I will be buying."

Thatu2019s why Iu2019m a big fan of Nudestix products, and their products are regulars in my makeup routine. This blush is very easy to use and user-friendly. I actually tapped it lightly on my cheeks and blended it with the included brush (which I love is included, along with the mirror which is also super cute). I found it a little drying for my lips (Iu2019m not a fan of matte lip products in general), so I will stick to using it as a blush. It blended easily and looks quite natural! I will say that it is more of a rose colour than the coral tone in the stock photo."

I also love the fact that the blush comes with a built in brush on the other end so it's perfect for traveling. I find that this shade is good for those days when you want to wear very minimal makeup and add some color but not for my everyday makeup. My skin tone/shade is in the medium range and unfortunately, the nude buff doesn't show up well on my face. Also, I find that applying the blush on the back of my hand first to warm it up rather than swiping directly on my face makes the texture so natural. All in all, it's a good natural blush! Maybe best suited for a lighter skin tone though."

I also tried it on my lips and eyes to bring it all together and it looked nice too, although I think it might lean slightly too warm for me to use on my lips, but that's due to my cool-toned colouring. I actually really like this product and will be reaching for it whenever I want a change from my typical pink/purple/peach powder blushes."

I wear the Dolce Darlin colour..it is a terracotta coral colour with a warm undertone. It gives my face warmth and dimension without feeling heavy or looking greasy. This color works well with my summer tan and brings out my olive undertones.  The packaging is really clever their is a brush that blends out the color really evenly, or you can also use your fingers. It's very easy and user-friendly, also the package comes in a cute tin with a mirror...everything you need to create a great glow is at your fingertips! I will be buying some shades for the colder months when my skin is less tan, such as their pink tones. Definitely need these, so easy to carry in your purse with the included tin. My friends also said my skin looked really healthy and not made up."

For an easier cleaning bonus, the brush is easily detachable so you can wash it without worrying about getting water into the cream blush half. Definitely a 10/10 for the overall packaging and ease of use. Next, I loved the color (Rosy Posy- cool pink), which looked great on the eyelids, cheeks, and lips. The texture goes on creamy but with a matte finish. Overall I really loved the application and initial results using this stick. However, because of the cream base it really doesn't last long unfortunately- it began creasing on my eyelids almost immediately (both with and without using primer first) and began to fade quite quickly on my lips and cheeks as well. The good thing is that the product is so portable so you can easily pop it in your purse for touch-ups throughout the day, however, personally I prefer products with longer lasting color."

I generally go for a powder blush on the odd occasion that I do use it, so I was interested in seeing how a stick would measure up. Compared to powder I would say it's definitely more buildable. The pigment is nice but it blends away really quickly when you use the brush attached so I kept having to add more for it to even be visible. I guess if you like a very, very subtle blush it's good otherwise don't blend it to much or build it up and it'll be just fine.   Overall, this is a nice product to have because it's convenient in that I was able to use it in my eyelids and lips and it worked well for both. Obviously the size of the stick is a little too large to use it directly so I had to use a smaller blush to apply it to my lids and lips without making a mess but I loved the convenience of it being a 3 in 1.   For causal blush users, I'd recommend it although I'm not sure if I'd repurchase for myself."

The application  of the stick itself  is effortless  with the buttery creamy crayon consistency. I find the brush that comes with the stick takes most of the product off so I just used my fingers to dab it.  The peachy colour is great for spring summer and I can see it transition in the early autumn. It leaves a fresh dewy  finish as a blush and a nice creamy lipstick (almost lipbalm) but I didn't like the application  on the eyelids much.  Overall I love it,  with the beautiful  peachy colour let's your skin look fresh and dewy, almost natural blush look."

Rather, it's quite tawny and pairs well with any lip or eye colour, letting those items do the talking. The true bonus is that it lasts all day and dries down to a pleasant, non-tacky finish, which can be difficult to find in the world of cream blushes. 5 stars from me!"

The packaging is great and I love not having to get my fingers dirty to blend. The color is quite concentrated and does not sheer out very much so a small dot goes a long way. It builds up well so you can always add more. The dense brush included in the product is just right to blend out most of the thick-ish product but I did prefer using my beauty sponge to blend out the edges that were just a bit too stark when I used only the included brush. When I added my powder blush on top, my cheek color lasted all day long. The shade Nude Buff is a beautiful, natural-looking, sun-kissed shade that I would wear every day. Highly recommend!"

However, the shade is not solid enough for my personal preference. I would buy a Nudestix shadow stick in the same shade in case they come up with some. I have already tried them in-store, and they have much more opacity.   I love this stick for quick looks, travel and carrying in my purse. I am obsessed with this Rosy Posy shade. Although the description says it is cool fuchsia pink, on my light-medium complexion, it seems to be more on a neutral side, being a perfect match for any lipstick. In addition, it lasts more than 8 hours on my combination skin, which is a win-win.    I wear this stick on the crease in the photos just for a pop with another powder eyeshadow. I have some lipgloss on in one picture and wear the stick alone in the another."

It's long-lasting, quick, and easy to apply, and it doesn't smudge my foundation. After applying the cream to my cheeks, I like to blend it out with my fingertips rather than the supplied brush. Pretty Peachy is excellent for my everyday makeup because it is a natural coral tone. I enjoy applying it as both eyeshadow and blush to achieve a nude makeup effect. The blush comes with a travel case and a mirror which fits into my purse very well."

I have been using it for a week, and lots of people have been asking me which blush I am using because it looks so good. This shade is a nice combination of peachy and pink tones, so beautiful and so pretty on cheeks. Such a summery and fresh shade, and you can achieve kind of a softer look with it. It is very easy to use, and you can apply it in several ways - on the cheeks, eyes, or lips. What I like about this product, comparing to other products, is that it comes with a brush, so you donu2019t have to use fingers all the time. It is so quick and easy to swipe it straight onto the skin, and the texture blends well with your fingers for a natural finish, or you can use the brush it comes with. Also, you can simply pack in it your purse, and the box it comes with has a mirror! So cute! I would definitely recommend it to anyone who likes to invest in a good blush, especially if you are looking for a multi-tasker, and I would definitely buy another packaging when I run out of it."

This Nudestix blush is incredibly effective at what I'm looking for in a blush. It's soft enough and pigmented enough to only require a tiny bit of product to get the effect I want but is controllable enough that one small swipe doesn't turn my entire face into a tomato, the brush attached to it works great and is soft. I even got a colour that I didn't think would suit me (Juicy Melons) and it turned out to be perfect and just wants to make me try the rest of the colours. I always love the packaging Nudestix products come in, it's a reusable tin with a mirror inside which makes it super easy for on-the-go application.

First of all, I really like the packaging of this; it comes in a small tin box with a mirror, and the blush stick has a built-in brush on the other end, making it convenient for travel and quick touch-ups. I usually go for full coverage makeup looks, which may be on the drying side, so I decided to use my fingers rather than gliding the stick directly on my face. I swirled my fingers onto the stick and lightly dabbing the colour onto my cheek slowly to avoid rubbing off my matte foundation. I then used the brush to blend it out. I can see that it blended out well on top of my foundation, the formula was quite creamy and pigmented and it gave a nice pink color to my cheeks. I also use it on my lips since it gives it a soft, natural look that goes perfectly with my makeup style. The blush was long-lasting and did not fade throughout the day, even though I wear my mask for the majority of the time I am outside, which is about 8 to 9 hours. Also, I noticed that it didn't transfer onto my mask. This product is great for multipurpose uses on the cheeks, lips, and eyes, and it helps me save a lot of time. I would definitely purchase it again and recommend this to my family and friends."

I've tried using my fingers as well as a brush and they both work great. Compared to the dewy line they also carry, this one is similar in terms of pigmentation - you can be light-handed or heavy-handed depending on your preference, and it can definitely be built up if needed. It even gives a bit of a blurring effect when applied, which the dewy one does not do. I was worried that this matte one might be drying or tug on my skin but it didn't at all. It blends nicely and is really convenient to bring around, especially due to its convenient packaging. This comes with a brush on one end, and while it's not my favourite brush in the world, it works in a pinch when I'm on the go and my hands are dirty and using my hands isn't an option. The box it comes in also has a mirror, which is great for little touchups.   All that aside, my blush arrived like someone had taken a swipe at it (refer to the photo) and then returned it, except it got sent out to me as a brand new item which is pretty gross. I had to completely disinfect it in order to give a review. Make sure your blush is untouched and unused before using it!"

First of, it comes in a lovely package. It's a nice black tin with a large mirror in the lid which you can use for any sort of little knick knack afterwards, which is great. The product itself is in a slick tube that is comparable to a lipstick tube but thicker. It's really simple to use; just stipple on your cheek and blend with your finger, great for someone who doesn't have much time to spend getting ready. You can also use the fancy brushes if you want, but I didn't. The colour is a clay, red colour which I was worried might be too dark for me, but it went on quite light, so you can definitely make the colour lighter or darker, depending on your preference. Since it's an all over cream, you can use it anywhere on your face. I tried it on my lips, but wasn't crazy about the colour, but it's nice to have the option! It's a nice creamy texture that kind of reminded me of a powdered blush, but with more moisture. Not sticky at all! Great product, would buy again for sure!"

The mirror is also great for on the go applying, retouching etc... This Nudestix also has a little brush on the other end of the Stix. This brush also makes it really easy to apply it to what extreme you want it to be. Goes On creamy they feels like powder and soft on your skin I like that you can use this Nudestix all over your face.  I chose to use it on my Cheeks as well as on my lips with some gloss to top my lips off with a shiny glow.  I like this Nudestix better than others that I have tried out there.  There are great colors to choose from.  I want to try more colors to add to my new collection of Nudestix. The color in the picture is Dolce Darlin'  I recommend Nudestix for your beauty needs.  Add it to your beauty collection like I did. Perfect for the purse and on the go !!"

I have warm light-medium olive skin tones and thought that this color still looked like a really natural flush on the cheeks and eyes, but it looked a little too icy for the lips.

The shade I received was Juicy Melons and it is a beautiful shade on my skin. It is also extremely versatile and can be also used as an eyeshadow or a lip colour!   The texture is creamy and extremely easy to blend with the skin. Can be used under or over foundation.  Perfect for a no-makeup look or a very extravagant look.   Overall, I really loved this product -  both for the formula, but also the packing, the convenience of it and the fact that this brand is extremely innovative and continues to put out a lot of great products.

I would suggest blending this under your foundation then dabbing some product on top using a sponge to control pigmentation. If you prefer powders and liquids this product will be hard to use at first. I received this as a free product to review so I have only tried this shade and the juicy melons shade. Juicy melons is a very beautiful peachy/pink shade. Dolce darlin is the slightly bit nude/brown. Overall itu2019s a great product but itu2019s pricier compared to the competition."

I have fairly oily skin, so I was nervous about the cream formula; however the longevity of it surprised me and it seemed to last all day! It applied very pigmented, but blended out nicely (once I figured out that there was a brush hidden on the other end). All in all it's a great blush and I look forward to buying the other shades for comparison!"

It's the perfect coral-y terra cotta colour which is great for the summer! It makes me look sun-kissed and gives a healthy glow. I like that it goes on as a cream and dries as a powder. Pigmented and easy to use. I'm all for functional products and design."

The blush itself is a bright coral pink. I was a little worried it was too bright at first, but with a little blending, it sits perfectly on my cheeks. I am fair (red undertones) with dark eyes and hair, and this pops beautifully in the most summery way. In terms of formulation, it's creamy, without being oily, but doesn't make a huge mess the way some liquid blushes do. (To note, I have quite dry skin, so I prefer makeup products that are glossy rather than powdery). The cherry on top is that it looks amazing as a cream eyeshadow (though it does slide into my crease a bit, even with primer). I tried it on my lip, but it has a little too much white in it, so I'll be sticking to using it as blush/eyeshadow."

This product is advertised as being good for the eyes, lips, as well as cheeks but I would only recommend it for the cheeks. On my lips, it faded extremely quickly but left a ring of colour around the edge which looked odd. On the cheeks, it is a faint and glowy colour which I enjoyed. I didn't really enjoy the applicator but in a pinch its an easy portable solution."

The compact and elegant stick applicator is very convenient to use, and it also comes with a brush on the other end, making it very travel-friendly.   The creamy formula glides smoothly  onto my skin and blends seamlessly. It blurs pores and covers small imperfections, while providing a soft matte-finish.   The tint is a beautiful nude shade with a hint of warm rose, it is pigmented but it looks very natural on my light skin tone once blended in.   I love makeup infused with skincare ingredients, and this blush is enriched with antioxidants from Vitamin E and Green Tea Extract.  I also appreciate it is a multipurpose product that can be used on eyes and lips as well!  5/5 recommended."

            "review_text": "I recently received the NUDESTIX Nudies Matte Lux All Over Face Blush Color in Juicy Melons for free from Bzzagent and NUDESTIX in exchange for my honest review.  I have previously tried the NUDESTIX All Over Face Highlight Color and I was so impressed with that product, so I was beyond ecstatic to try this All Over Face Blush.   I am always so impressed with the packaging from NUDESTIX, the product comes in a little matte black tin case with a mirror on the inside which makes it so convenient for application and touch ups on the go. The little case also acts as an extra layer of protection to make sure the product doesn't get damaged or get all over the inside of your bag just in case there's a loose lid or unclosed cap.  The formula of this blush is super creamy and smooth and just glides onto the skin like butter, and once you start working it into the skin, it turns into a powder and becomes matte which is so interesting! You can apply and blend this with your fingers or use the little brush on the opposite end of the product to help blend out the product (the brush is also SUPER soft, and it detaches for washing!). The colour is so beautiful as well, it's a nice coral colour in my opinion and gives a natural blush look that is coming from within.  Although this product is labeled as a blush, you can use this product on your lips and eyes as well, which I love as you get that cohesive colour and look throughout for your makeup, but it also means you can carry less makeup products with you for touch ups!   Overall, I am so impressed with this product and just the NUDESTIX brand in general and I absolutely recommend you to try it!"

This is a wonderful and easy to blend blush. I love the color, its a nice light color that's perfect for day and night looks. It's a nude blush so it doesn't look greasy on the face. I'm usually someone that's a little scared to use blush as sometimes it can look cakey but this product comes with a buffer brush attached, that's perfect for toning down the blush and making it even on you're face. I love the brush as it soothes out the blush but doesn't mess with you're foundation like some other similar blush brushes. I love that the blush and the brush are attached because you'll never lose the brush and it'll always be there ready to blend.  I like this blush because its very versatile, I used it as a blush (of course) and also put a little bit on my eyes and some on my lips to achieve that monochromatic look that's very in right now.  I wanted to see how it would look on a different skin tone so I put some on my mom and it also complimented her well and she also has a little bit of combination skin and the blush still applied beautifully so its perfect for all skin types and all ages.   In conclusion I love, love this company and love this blush and will definitely buy it in the future.  Thank you to buzz agent for gifting it to me.  #gotitfree #lovingit #naturalblush #buzzagent"

The brush applicator side is interesting I had to get a little used to it. It's a good product but not necessarily better than my regular powder blush. I personally think powder is easier to spread around than this but might just be me. I do like that I can use it all over. I sometimes used it on my lids and lips for a cute natural rosy look. Overall I do like this blush!"

I own several different variations of the NUDESTIX face sticks/all over face colour (around 10 in total: matte, dewy). This formula was significantly different, as it felt more like a cream-to-powder formulation. It applied more sheer and slightly patchier than either the matte or dewy face colour formulations, but blended out nicely for a velvety smooth, non-sticky finish .I found the lasting power to be on par and it performed well through the day, but it definitely has less outright pigmentation and is far less tacky, and moves around less than the other products in the line. There was a plasticky, almost play-dough scent in the tube but dissipated on application.  This would work well on anyone who enjoys cream/powder formulations, but struggles with the thickness/stickiness of certain cream products. I found it wore well under a mask too and stayed on my skin, instead of sticking onto the mask as thicker cream blushes tend to do."

As a multitasking colour stick, this cream-to-powder colour balm aims to give you naturally flushed cheeks, lips, and eyes.   I tried this Nudies stick in u201cPretty Peachyu201d. Not only is the colour beautiful, but its buttery-soft formula melts onto your skin with a simple swipe, with further blending done with the dual-ended brush, which blurs the colour even further for a soft-matte finish.  The colour balm comes packaged in a to-go-tin with a mirror, making it perfect for travelling. Plus, Nudestix is a cruelty-free and vegan clean beauty product, so you can feel good while wearing Nudies on your face!  Thank you BzzAgent for the complimentary products. I highly recommend Nudies to anyone in search of a pigmented yet easy to blend multipurpose colour stick!"

Compared to the original matte formula this is much more weightless and not as thick, but it blends even easier, like air! It gives the perfect wash of colour that looks so flattering to the cheeks. I know this will be a favourite. Formula wise and colour ---- it's perfect."

I once put little bit on my finger and tap it lightly on my cheek and it doesnu2019t break my foundation. It is so much better than other stick blushes out there. As it is super hydrating on the skin you wont feel that your skin is dry or this is making your skin dry. It came in a little tin box in which u can put small brushes for travel. The stick has its applicator at the back that comes handy when i will be traveling. I will definitely buy this product again and i am thinking of buying the other shades. I will definitely recommend this to anyone who has dry skin like me. It is super hydrating and doesnu2019t make my skin look dry which happens when i use powder blush. I just love this blush. TIP: It is great on its own too without foundation just for that flush of color and for natural look."

I once put little bit on my finger and tap it lightly on my cheek and it doesnu2019t break my foundation. It is so much better than other stick blushes out there. As it is super hydrating on the skin you wont feel that your skin is dry or this is making your skin dry. It came in a little tin box in which u can put small brushes for travel. The stick has its applicator at the back that comes handy when i will be traveling. I will definitely buy this product again and i am thinking of buying the other shades. I will definitely recommend this to anyone who has dry skin like me. It is super hydrating and doesnu2019t make my skin look dry which happens when i use powder blush. I just love this blush. TIP: It is great on its own too without foundation just for that flush of color and for natural look."

And you can definitely wear this as a blush on top of bare skin, or on top of liquid and powder foundations. Itu2019s very versatile! I would definitely recommend cleaning and air drying the attached brush every time you use it, as product buildup might affect the blending and your skin overall. I will say, I do think I picked the wrong colour. Itu2019s a light shade of pink which doesnu2019t go well my skin shade. But I believe it was the darkest one they were sampling.

I tried the Nudies Bloom in the shade Bohemian Rose and it was the perfect everyday shade for my skin tone. I have been wearing it as blush to work five days a week, through eight-hour shifts, for the past two weeks and the product has performed beautifully. There were a few warm days when I felt like I was melting, but I was pleased to see that my blush was holding up perfectly! It looked natural on my skin, brightened up my face, and looked amazing even as it faded later into the day. There was no splotchy-ness. I recommend dusting your cheeks lightly with setting powder or another blush to lock it in because I found it lasted much longer that way. The balm looked and felt comfortable on my lips as well. I was happy to see that it did not exaggerate the lines or make my lips feel dry. Again, it was a natural flush of colour that was perfect for daytime, with the ability to apply more and amp it up a bit for the evening/night. The packaging is also simple but effective. I love the mirror on the inside of the tin and the brush on the end of the balm. It is a great product for travelling! Overall, Nudies Bloom is a great option to grab if you like cream products and if you like to keep your makeup minimal."

The only negative thing about this nudestix is the staying power - it is not long lasting so you will have to reapply at least twice in a day.

The Bohemian Rose color I received is a nice rosey pink shade which you can apply to your cheeks, lips, and/or eyelides to add a dab of color. The color blends in quite well with the brush applicator on the other end of the stick providing a nice, natural rosy color. The size of the applicator stick is perfect - small enough to carry around in your purse or your pocket, but mighty size to allow enough color use for several months and a brush for on-the-go blending. Looking forward to trying other shades and products from Nudestix!"

The tin it comes in is cute because it has a mirror but I feel it to be extra and unnecessary. I like that it's dual ended - the cream stick on one end and the brush on the other. The brush is soft and dense, a little too dense for me personally, when blending this product I use my fingers. The cherry blossom shade is beautiful! Blends out easily. I use it alone on light makeup days (concealer, mascara, lipgloss). On heavier makeup days I layer this with a powder blush and highlight ontop of my foundation. This also makes a cute lip color! Versatile! Stays on pretty well for a cream product. Overall I'd recommend this shade and product - I just feel the price is a bit to high for me to personally repurchase. I'd still love to try more from this brand - I like the concept!"

I like to pick up the colour with a denser blush brush and pat the color into the skin and build up the color in layers. The finish is definitely dewy but at the same time it dries down into a powder within minutes, no stickiness at all. I had this blush on from 7am-5pm (10 hours) with no setting spray. I had to put on a mask several times a day and where the mask rubbed against my cheek you can see a little bit of fading but overall the colour was still there! This is no different than the other nudestix that I own, they live up to its claim that they are longwearing. The packaging is perfect for travelling and on-the-go.

You can apply the product anywhere on your face for a bit of colour or glow with or without other makeup or foundation. I applied the product on my cheeks, lips and eyelids after applying foundation for a pop of colour. You can apply as much or as little product as your want depending on how much colour you want.

What I love most about this blush, is that is does not create a mess when you use it, unlike most powder blushes, which crumble when you use the brushes on them. Also, it leaves no sticky texture once you blend it with the brush, which is already included!  I do recommend this product, it is perfect to keep at home or to carry on the go, since it is compact and the blending brush is already included, not to mention a mirror! And the quality and pigmentation are amazing!"

It is very pigmented and the product can be built up or sheered out depending on what look you prefer.  This worked as well on my skin as other cream blushes do. Not very well. The colour lasted maybe 5 hours before I noticed that it completely disappeared off my face.  I love that it's very portable and has a brush attached. That way I don't have to carry a separate brush which can be bulky especially when travelling.  Cream products tend not to last on my face so no, I wouldn't buy this product. Not for myself anyway. Not because I wasn't happy with it but because creams in general just don't last on my face.  I would recommend this blush to people who like cream products and having the ability to decide how opaque or sheer to apply it."

The cherry blossom shade is a beautiful match for my skin tone.

On the other side of the tube, there's a built-in soft round brush to help blend into the skin if you're using it like a cream blush. However, I used this on my lips instead of my eyes and face as I found it too sticky to apply to those specific areas. I also found that this rubs off easily as it has a glossy finish. It didn't last long and it transfer easily, so you have to reapply."

The color stick comes in a black tin, that has a mirror in the lid and it's super handy for on-the go use.  The product itself is a great size, fitting in both my makeup bag and purse. The color is a beautiful rosy pink that will be so wearable for spring and summer. I have a fair neutral complexion, and wear golden tones when I'm tanned. I tested the color against both my fair and tanned foundations, and it was universally flattering.  The application was very easy- just roll up the stick and glide on the skin. I found that dabbing was better for since I was using full-coverage foundation and wanted to prevent my other products from moving too much. I chose to place the product on the top of my cheekbones for a lifted blush effect, as well as over my nose and eyebrows for a naturally sun-kissed look. I also applied it to my lips, and loved the creamy formula, shine and natural pink tint it gave me. The formula is creamy and well-pigmented. It can definitely be built up to a more intense flush. It blended nicely with a dense blush brush, as well as my Beautyblender. The color wore well over an 8-hour day, and withstood about 45mins inside a mask. I will absolutely be reaching for this product all spring and summer long for a warm flush! I would recommend this product for its use, versatility and portability. The only critique I might have is to add a brush to the other side of the stick, so it could be touched up on-the-go (i.e.: ABH blush stick). Otherwise, this is an awesome product and cherry blossom is a gorgeous skin tint!"

Cute tin with a mirror on the inside so you can apply the stick, either directly or with your fingers or a brush.  Tbh the tin is great but I personally wouldnu2019t carry it around with me as itu2019s a bit of extra bulk but good for keeping the stick safe during travel. The brush itself on the stick barely does much so I prefer to use my own brush or my fingers.    The product itself glides on super smooth like a dewy crayon.  Itu2019s really easy to blend into the skin for that flushed look.  Your skin actually looks plump when you blend it through and really dewy.  I will say that throughout the day I noticed it wasnu2019t as prominent as when I first put it on.  The colour I got is a really cute glowy pink.  It showed up great on my cheeks but not so much on my lids.    Overall I think this product is great for a very natural/summer look.  The stick is small enough to carry around with you on its own and it does have multiple uses.  I would buy it but just in a darker shade :)"

I use it on my lips with a lip balm for that extra dewy feel, a touch on my cheeks for a nice glow and on my eyes. It is not sticky and not drying, it's just perfect. It came with the cutest tin box that has a mirror on the inside. Overall, it feels like a very high-quality product and a lot of thought went into it.   There is a very soft dense brush on one side that helps to blend it out on your face. I use my finger to apply a few dabs on my cheeks and you can build the colour on your eyes and lips from very opaque to a rich colour depending on what look you're going for. Love all the different colours available and will be buying more colours."

Then I noticed that the packaging listed u201cFaceu201d and u201cLipsu201d as application sites - u201cEyesu201d was conspicuously missing (while all the other Nudies do list u201cEyesu201d also).

I love stick blushes and liquid blushes, but they have a tendency not to stay put, but this formula actually stays on all day. And I have to admit, the fact that it comes with a little brush on the other end is very convenient. It applies a lot nicer than patting it in with my fingers, which I do with most cream blushes. The color is gorgeous too, I would highly recommend this shade if you like Glossieru2019s Dusk. I have trouble finding a true nude shade like this, so thereu2019s another plus for me. It says matte, but I think it gives you a nice glow. Thereu2019s definitely no shimmer or anything like that, but Iu2019d describe it as a satin finish. I canu2019t wait to try some more shades."

It blended out well but did not last long even with primer and setting spray, after a few hours my cheeks were also looking greasier than usual. I know I bought a dewy colour, but other dewy blushes do not give me a greasy look, just glowy. Overall, as someone who is in the marketing business, I can now see that this may be a heavily marketed item and brand, especially since the brand gets so defensive on any negative reviews. Not to mention that itu2019s sold in Target now (is this a luxury brand worth its price or not ???). Could be a good product for you, but in all honesty I would check out the Fenty, Rare Beauty, or Glossier cream blushes first, way cheaper too. Packaging is a little over the top too, and the brush does nothing. Definitely wonu2019t be purchasing again."

I do not like dragging the face and I apply using my own brush that I pack with product and apply. If you are running tight on cash I suggest getting a versatile all around color such as sunset strip which is a good staple coral. Truthfully, all the colors would look perfect.

Not opaque enough for a bronzer and a bit too muddy for a blush color. Overall, feeling disappointed that I paid $34 for a glorified lip gloss."

I use it over my moisturizer so I couldn't say how it would behaive over concealer and a foundation but I can imagine this wouldn't be a fun product. I find that even after a few, three, hours I can still feel it's sticky tacky presence on my cheeks. Not a fan. Powder blushes wear off enough in the days of mask wearing and I was hoping for a color that would melt into the skin a bit more to avoid mask transfer.  I've tried this on my lips just to see and it isn't an opaque coverage. It's smooth, not tacky but not enjoyable either."

If you're wanting to buy this, I'd just keep in mind that its more of a stiff / less emollient formula, and if you don't like that in a cream blush, you probably won't enjoy this one."

However, the balmy texture is also the reason why it absolutely melts into the skin forming itu2019s skin-like appearance. I also find that unlike the other cream blush formulas it only plays well with other dewy formulas. I have oily skin so this is going to be a winter only blush since my skin is more dry and I donu2019t wear matte products. The summer heat and my oily skin will probably break the blush down to quickly, but I will see. The color is a soft, warm peach. Online swatches made it look like it had some pink undertones as well, but those didnu2019t come through due to my peach undertones."

Again, I paid a premium for it--my fingers work well, ditch the brush & tin and save us some money.  Price: this is a prestige brand with prestige pricing. The product itself is beautiful and would probably last a few months with daily use, I'm sure lab costs factor into the price. That being said, the exterior packaging & brush are unnecessary. I don't even think these products need a unicarton. Just wrap them, get rid of the brush, and drop the price a couple of dollars or give consumers a lot more product.   The amount of product in every single item listed is kind of a joke compared to other brands in this price range. Food for thought.   Pretty blush, good formula, packaging makes it feel like a rip off."

I loved this coral peach color, it gives a natural flush that looks great on my olive skin. I have acne prone skin and had no issues with break outs from this product which is awesome! I received this item free in exchange for review. I can't wait to buy the next shade... currently deciding which one to go for!"

The shade is pigmented yet it is very easy to blend out the packaging is very well-constructed in that the opposite side of the blush contains a synthetic brush that blends out the product beautifully and you can untwist it so that you can wash and dry the brush. I see this being a staple during the summer and also on days where you don't want to carry or wear a powder blush. This gives a demi natural matte finish to the skin."

            "review_text": "This is a cream blush formula that comes with a little brush on the end to blend it out. I would say this is more of a blush to wear on natural makeup days, because when you blend it out it becomes this gorgeous sheer veil of color on the cheeks. You can build it up too which is nice, however I find I would rather just use something more pigmented if Iu2019m desiring a more bold blush. Thatu2019s just personal preference though bc I hate spending time layering when I can use a product that just comes off stronger initially. This is definitely the kind of product you could literally put on without a mirror and it will always blend out softly, and effortlessly. This color is complimentary for me because I tend to lean neutral/golden. If youu2019re more of a rosey undertone Iu2019d suggest getting a color that leans a little more pink VS peach so Iu2019d keep that in mind. Additionally, I tried layering it on top of powder/underneath and didnu2019t notice a major difference so you can for sure use it under or over makeup. So taking all of that into account I think this will be a go-to for that u201cI just have to run to target real quicku201d type of makeup look! Quick. Easy for beginners. Effortless. Hard to mess up!"

Corals usually make me look like a giant freckle but somehow this stuff is a color that actually works. I applied some to my cheeks and lips but haven't tried it on my eyes as well at the same time. The color blended nicely and a little goes a long way! My main complaint is how the color looked on my lips after a few hours - it was still there, but really cakey and had migrated away from my outer lip to just my inner lips. Still, a nice tool to have in my travel bag for some quick color between meetings etc."

The applicator for the Nudestix is so convenient too! The brush end is very dense, but soft and shaped well. It works perfectly for quick applications on the go. On the eyes this shade offers a very subtle deepness to the lid that provided dimension without it looking like I was wearing makeup, its perfect for a nude look! Being able to use one product for lips, eyes, and cheeks takes any guesswork out of matching shades for a monochromatic look. This product is a keeper for sure!"

The stick also picks up dust/lint etc quite quickly because the formula is so wet, and like most cream products does not last as long as its powder conterparts. I prefer the milk makeup cream blush sticks for better longevity.  Pro tips - the box doubles nicely as a bobby pin etc holder.

I would still recommend but just know the amount of product you end up receiving.   See photo, it is about the same size as my thumb nail.

Used this a couple of times so far: first time I bounced a wet beauty blender sponge onto the stick several times before bouncing it on my cheeks. Looked good, very subtle color on my fair to light skin and dewy, but I also layered it with another peachy blush to bring out the color more - was very nice. But my subsequent tries with either sponge, applying straight from stick to cheeks, or with fingers, I had trouble with my foundation being disturbed underneath. Plus couldnu2019t get color to be more vibrant as I wanted without fading my foundation too. Resorted to just using for my lips and have been loving it this way - also been searching for a fresh peachy color for lips. This is kind of pricey to just use for lips, but donu2019t wanna waste and like the color better there. As others have said, it is pretty tacky. Maybe not an issue for some, but I couldnu2019t work with it. But very nice as a lip color!"

I was on the hunt for a summer blush that would look natural on me. I could not choose between Sunset Strip and Nude Peach so I bought both of them! I am in love with Nude Peach! It leaves a very natural peachy suntan color that is buildable if I want more intensity. I did not like Sunset Strip as much on me. I had high hopes for it considering how popular it was on YouTube videos. It was more of a reddish-rosy color on me and didnu2019t feel like it was a natural suntan color. It would be a good color to wear for formal events or to wear on a girls night out. As for the formula, this is new for me and I think Iu2019m addicted to cream blushes now! Colors are great, buildable, easy to apply and blend effortlessly! I also love how compact these sticks are! Easy to travel with for reapplication when needed! I will be trying out more products from this brand."

A nice tip I learned from my favourite makeup artist is to swipe the colour on your cheek, let it sit there; in the meantime, work on your brows or mascara. After a minute or two, the heat of your skin really helps to make the product even more natural and blendable. I then use my (clean) fingers to evenly spread it around. =)"

Iu2019ve always been more of a beauty sponge user versus a brush, but lately Iu2019ve gotten into applying my foundation with a dense brush, and I find the best way to blend this blush is to go in with the same brush. The formula is a bit tacky so it can be difficult to blend with a sponge. Iu2019m giving it four stars because I wish it would last a bit longer on the face. I donu2019t find that it moves around. It just disappears eventually."

This is the first time I've ever purchased a product from this line, but I don't think it will be the last. I wish I had purchased the kit for a few dollars more where it includes the same color I bought (naughty n'spice) along with the highlighter, but I think they only sell that online. I did try applying this straight out of the tube directly onto my cheeks but that just resulted in wasted product. You really do need to apply it in light layers and pat more than rub it into the skin so it melts with whatever you have on underneath. The container these comes in is also cute and convenient. There is a magnifying mirror the full length of the lid that you can use when applying on the go which is helpful. When I was testing out shades one of the SAs recommended that I use a brush over the stick, but I find that I don't need one, and again I've never used the brush attached."

Iu2019ve owned the Nudestix eyeshadows for awhile now and really like them (for many of the same travel reasons and the great quality) so I was looking forward to trying this.   And wow, itu2019s even better than I expected! I bought the Sweet Peach Peony shade and it is THEE perfect glowy peachy pink, which Iu2019m always looking for since I found out that my favorite blush is made by a company that is no longer cruelty free. That blush is Nars Orgasm by the way. Itu2019s not shimmery like Orgasm, but it is an absolutely perfect peachy pink. Itu2019s dewy and more natural looking too. Iu2019ve read some reviews that say it lifts foundation, but I donu2019t have this problem, as I donu2019t swipe it across my cheeks or rub it in with my fingers. I dot it on and then stipple it with the brush. I donu2019t know if this method will work for everyone, as it could be that I donu2019t use actual foundation. I use tinted moisturizer with loose powder, but if it doesnu2019t move lighter products like that, I canu2019t imagine this method would move foundation. Looks beautiful as a lipstick too. I canu2019t wait to try more shades!"

It's a soft textured mat application on me.  I also really appreciate the availability of coral and warm tones -- it seems some lip and product lines really tilt to the berry and cool side. I felt that the colors were true to my expectations. The packaging is excellent -- the little tin box that the product comes in, includes a mirror -- very helpful, and the tin keeps the product from getting banged up in your purse."

It has a bit more color impact than the regular (but those are all nude shades), and itu2019s way easier to sheer out/ apply.

Additionally, when I went to wash the brush for the first time a chunk of bristles (probably ~1/3 of the brush) popped out. It would be simple enough to fix but I was disappointed that the brush couldn't withstand being washed especially given that this isn't a cheap product.

I primarily use these as blush but you can definitely wear these on your lips as well. I apply this directly on the cheeks from the stick and then blend with a beautyblender. These blend out really easy and look so dewy and pretty on the cheeks. I sometimes put a powder blush on top and it looks great as well. I would say these fade after about 4-5 hours so when I put a light powder blush on top it helps the longevity a bit. I am taking a star off for the same reason as the other sticks like this from nudestix, the amount of product you get for the price is a little steep but I'm more okay with it when it comes to a blush because you don't use nearly as much as you do with a bronzer. I also find the brush on the other end is useless, it is too stiff to properly blend and not disturb the other makeup you are wearing. Other than that I love these and will probably buy more and I hope they extend the range in the future."

You can also detach the little brush (if you want to use that - personally I used another buffing brush) that comes with it for cleaning purposes which I thought was cool. The reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 is because I find the top of the blush gets a little lint-covered. Every little hair, fuzzy, piece of lint gets stuck to it. I think this is probably common amongst cream products, but it wouldnu2019t deter me from buying another."

Definitely very pigmented and even a bit too intense for my pale skin, so I'd go in with a light hand or stipple on with a brush. I have a bunch of the matte blushes from nudestix that I swipe from the apples of my cheeks to the top of my cheekbones for a more contoured blush look, but when I tried the same look with this there was just too much pigment and it was not flattering on me, so I had to blend it out quite a bit. This is actually the first time I've found use for the brushes that come with these, but they're actually quite nice for stippling and blending. These blushes also are noticeably stickier than the matte versions, so they pick up more makeup when you swipe them on directly. I'd say just use these on the apples of your cheeks and apply with a brush if possible, this will give you a very summery dewy cheek look. The one way that this product really hit the mark for me was as a lip color. It is the absolute perfect juicy red coral lip, and with the same color on the cheeks (and eyes if you don't have oily eyelids and can figure out a way to make these set down) it creates a gorgeous monochromatic look that is very in these days. However, I do have to say that the matte nudies are in my opinion just as glowy on the skin when applied with the fingers, and just have a better formula in general that doesn't really remove base product underneath, so I'd opt for those unless one of these shades speaks to you in particular. I've heard the sweet peach peony and cherry blossom shades are similar to shades in the matte line, so I probably won't be buying any more of the dewy colors. This will definitely be a staple summer lip color and I'll keep playing with it as a blush, but beyond the great color I do feel a little let down by this product."

I stopped into my Copley store and picked this up in Sweet Peach Peony, along with the tinted blur stick in #2 (already own and love). I had just come from a haircut and yoga and only had Revision TruPhysical sunblock on and my brows done. I patted a bit of this on both cheeks... immediately fell in love with the sheer light coral balm and soft shine! So natural! It's too light for my lips, but stunning wash of color on my cheeks. I left and didn't think anything of it, then struck up a conversation with a guy on the T. 20 minutes later, after mentioning he was 25 and asking my age (40 - which I did not mention but told him I was much older than he was), he hands me his card and says, Text me. We should meet up some time. A friend who saw me a little later described my skin as lit from within. Thank you Bloom! My new love from NudeStix!"

I ordered both Sweet Peach Peony and Cherry Blossom Babe - the swatches here don't do them justice, so I've included a picture in natural lighting below (Cherry Blossom Babe on the left, Sweet Peach Peony on the right). This formula is different from the matte nudies, as it stays dewy on the skin and gives more of a fresh, plump look. These also blend beautifully and seamlessly into the skin, and both of these shades look absolutely gorgeous on the skin alone or over foundation. The pigmentation of these is also great - the swatches below are one swipe, and I can get a perfect amount of blush by dotting the stick on my face about 1-2 times on each cheek. However, I find that these stay a little tacky and don't really set like the matte nudies do - if you're not down with things being tacky on your skin, I'd play with these in store when they launch before you commit. I do feel like these last as long as my matte nudies and don't move around on me throughout the day, but I do have pretty normal skin - I'm not sure how long these would last if you've got oily or combo skin. As for the multi-use claims: I don't particularly like these on the eyes as they don't completely dry down, which sometimes leads to creasing or more product movement than I'd like, but they do look lovely on both the lips and cheeks. I do think these colours and the dewy finish are absolutely beautiful for spring and summer, so I'm happy to add these to my cream blush collection."

However I have found that the trick is to remove the brush from the bottom of the tube and dab it on the stick, then stipple it lightly over your cheek or wherever you want the colour to go. This application allows you to be in complete control of the intensity and also blends the colour in perfectly! My only problem now is choosing which to use everyday. This is really a great product and coupled with their eye and lip pencils, my morning makeup routine has gone from 30-40 mins to a quick 10 mins, and everything lasts all day!  Also, after purchasing these from Sephora I went directly to the Nudestix site to see all the other products they have and have also purchased their new NUDIES Bloom Stix and am excited to try them as soon as they are delivered!"

I wanted to try a cream blush and I saw on IG that Mary Philips (Kendall Jenners MUA) loves Nudestix, so I decided to give it a shot. I LOVE this product so much! The colour is amazing, the cream goes on easily and has an effortless blend. It stays put all day! I apply it by putting the cream on a fluffy synthetic brush and blending it on my cheeks. If youu2019re debating purchase it, I would highly recommend it!"

It wears well throughout the day and even on my super oily skin, it doesnu2019t get shiny, even when I donu2019t set it with a lot of powder. The brush on the opposite end is actually great with the product, I know often brushes that come with products arenu2019t good, but this one works super well with the product.

I've been using the same one for months and there is still months of product left. It lasts forever and is well worth the price. One tip is to brush powder foundation over it right after you apply it and it makes the blush blend even better and practically melt into your skin with a spritz of setting spray. It looks great as a wash of color on eyelids as well. This particular shade is sold out often for a reason."

I purchased this in the shades Sunset Strip (bold coral) and Sunkissed (bronzey like you just got out of the sun). Pros: super blendable, the shades are pretty, multi-use. Cons: not long lasting, could apply patchy, pricey for the amount of product you get (I think it's pricey because of the brush and the tin it comes with, and i don't use either). I couldn't justify the cons so I unfortunately returned Sunset Strip since coral is a popular shade for blushes and it could be replaced. I kept Sunkissed because it's such a unique and beautiful color."

It does not stay tacky on the skin, but you have maybe 30 seconds to blend it out (read: do one cheek at a time).

I bought Naughty N Spice and followed it shortly by Bondi Bae as a contour. I'm pretty new to blush application/contouring so I'm still figuring out the best way to apply, but I appreciate the cream formula (Bondi Bae goes on smoother and blends easier than Naughty N Spice). The brush takes some practice to blend it without removing it, and the staying power isn't quite a full work day on bare skin (I don't wear foundation). Perhaps this would be improved with a setting powder or similar. Naughty N Spice is a nice shade for my fair/medium freckled skin and Bondi Bae is great for summer contouring. 1 star removed for staying power and not the easiest blending for the NnS colour."

This heavy-hitting multitasker provides all the color I need save for lips, as it is actually slightly lighter than my natural lip color and I prefer to go a tad deeper.

The color is so beautiful (especially as a blush) it melts into the skin for a beautiful natural look! I stared at myself for 10 minutes in the mirror because I could not believe how beautiful and smooth the blush looked on the skin! Definitely see more nudestix products in my future!"

            "review_text": "It's very hard for a pale girl with my exact skin shade to find bronzing products that do not look ridiculous (Orange being one of the most obvious makeup product sins). I have Bare Back and the Maple one, and cannot believe how well they blend in with bare face or other products. I particularly enjoy using the sticks in all three areas, with a magnetic eye colour added to increase definition. These feel so effortless on, and I appreciate that they actually are just an natural enhancement to your real skin tone (we're talking eye circle flaws and all).   I knocked one star off for packing. Having a huge collection of the tins is illogical, and it's wasteful to have to continually recycle/throw them out. I love having the original sized tin from one product to carry a few sticks, but it really doesn't make sense for the Nudies. The tin is much smaller, unable to hold any other Nudestix products, and unable to hold more than one of the Nudies. It really makes me sad to think of how many of these tins are likely being wasted."

I run into the same problem with Nars concealer (and so many others!). I want to use it to contour, but the darkest color matches my skin exactly, so no Nudestix for us:(  Sidenote: Just to be clear, I have dark skin, but I'm not as dark as most that would consider themselves darker toned, and if I'm having a hard time, I can't imagine what it's like to try to find something even darker. just saying"

Naughty n spice is great because it's a nice neutral pink color that doesn't have shimmers. Bondi bae is not red toned or cool toned. It's more golden brown I feel like. It is kind of small but I think it's worth trying."

I blend it out with any kind of synthetic brush or a beauty blender (the brush it comes with is too stiff and wipes the product right off). Happy to find a Cream Bronzer that works for me"

            "review_text": "I left this review but apparently Sephora deleted it so take 2!  My experience with Nudestix products has been pretty disappointing and this product does nothing to change my mind, most multi-use products tend to excel at one more than the others because formulation and use are both mutually dependant and this is no different.  On my face this product is frustrating to apply because the product is quite stiff and swiping pulls and moves my foundation either way blending is very difficult, it tends to just stick onto your skin and despite trying to blend with my fingers or a brush or a sponge (all damp or dry) the product is difficult to move once it's on without irritating my not-particularly-sensitive skin.  On my lips the product is fairly dry but as a colour it's not bad, it doesnt' work with my skintone as it's very warm like a dark orange terracotta colour but it may for other skintones.  On my eyes I learned from trying to apply it as a blush to pat the colour on using my fingertips and that seems to be the best possible use for the product so far.  I'll let you know right away the brush is awful and borderline abrasive on my skin, it looks very soft and dense right up until you try to use it and looking at the bristles from the top it's very clearly short bristled that are not dense enough to move or apply any product, I tried using this on the much much softer Nars Multiple formula and the problem remained the same with the added disadvantage of the brush pulling product off my face and into the brush.  The tin as usual is gimmicky is useless, I immediately took the product out of all the packaging and threw everything else into recycling because it's just excessive tacky packaging in my opinion.  Overall I think there are far better multi products out there and this one certainly isn't worth the price tag. I will continue trying to use this over the summer maybe as a bronzer and mixing it with different primers to make it easier to use but I completely regret picking this up at $33 pricetag. I would not recommend this to anyone."
