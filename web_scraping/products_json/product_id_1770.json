At first you can smell the pear but itu2019s really faint, itu2019s the caramel, amber, and vanilla that takes over. Freaking amazing! Can I also just say how surprised I am that the smell is still noticeable, I mean wow! I have yet to purchase it but Iu2019m going to for Christmas. It kind of reminds me of Prada Paradoxe too."

I have purchased this perfume for all of my sisters and everyone adores this scent like no other.  It is a true gem. I always get compliments when I wear this, but I wear it because I cannot stop smelling my wrists and this fragrance is calming, uplifting and just flat out gorgeous. This is probably my favorite scent ever."

If you close the cap fully, especially after any of that weak stream had made contact with the rim, the cap gets stuck and will rip the entire top off the glass the next time you try to open it.

Iu2019ve been looking up recommendations for vanilla perfumes and this one came up (plus it has vanilla in the name). Itu2019s not at all what I expected. I donu2019t get vanilla from this really at all. I get super sweet sugary pear with a green woodsy note. Iu2019m not sure how to feel about it.

Iu2019m a big vanilla girly and so this is definitely my type of scent, but I think it might not be for you if you donu2019t like the sweet, warm smells.
