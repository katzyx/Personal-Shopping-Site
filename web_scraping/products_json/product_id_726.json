This time I put it on my face before checking it (assuming the last bottle was rotten). OMG!  It had the same horrible smell, color and burned my skin!  I just returned it.

Half of all the bottles Iu2019ve bought have been already oxidized and sticky on the first use. When I get a good bottle the serum is clear and has a slight almost unnoticeable sweet smell and glides in and absorbs so smoothly. However the bottle I JUST bought and opened (as well as half of my previous bottles) are orange, sticky, smell weird, and pill under my other products. I live in a rural area without a Sephora so I donu2019t have the option of going to the store to return it and I donu2019t have the money to ship it back and wait for a refund so Iu2019m stuck going without until I can afford to just buy another.

I don't have much discoloration or spots to fade. When I do get the occasional hormonal acne, I notice this serum helps fade the mark it usually leave behind. It's caused no irritation and my skin can be sensitive. The smell is, not bad but not great. Luckily is fades fast. It can feel a wee bit tacky and I feel like when it dries it's a little sticky, but not noticeable after sunscreen. For the price, I'll definitely repurchase. Again, I see this more as a preventative product so as long as I don't see any new lines, spots, or dullness to my 34 year old skin, I'm figuring it's working."

In addition, it really dries my skin out. I usually wait a few minutes between applying products. After this, my skin feels very dry and tight after 1-2 mins. The website says to wait around 10 minutes before adding other skincare products, and I don't know how that's recommended. Even if I apply HA and my moisturizer after, my skin is still tight until my natural oils are secreted a few hours later. Of note, I do live in a very dry city. I did enjoy the pump it comes in, although I know it leaked with some customers, I never had that issue even with travel. I believe they changed it into a tube now anyway which is a shame.  I will not be repurchasing, but will try another vitamin c product."

It's amazing how many antioxidant products aren't packaged this way.  It's a real problem because then you pay for product you can't use -- because it oxidizes.  Not only was this packaged appropriately, but it works.  It really works!  my skin is literally brighter with a sun-kissed glow.  It's easy to apply.  AND, the price is great.  Keep up the good work!!!  What a smart product.  We need more of this sort of marriage between form and function."

I had to mix it in with moisturizer so it wasnu2019t as potent -didnu2019t give me the glow unlike some other vitamin c serums -no improvement in firmness or skin tone Overall it was a nice basic serum that seems to be good formulated and easy to use.

I've used many different products - high end to low end - and I've never used a product that worked so fast and so well. I've referred this product to many friends who now swear by it as well.
