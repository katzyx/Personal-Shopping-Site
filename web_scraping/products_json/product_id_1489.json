I will pop them on for 10 minutes after washing my face and before applying any other skincare. Obviously they aren't a permanent fix, more of a pick-me-up when your face needs it. They are great cost wise too compared to similar products. I buy the value pack of 16 sets and when I get the 20% savings code, they end up being less than $4 for each set."

Not only is the smell very offputting (rancid oil -- its likely the olive oil ingredient) but they discolour from pure white to a darker offwhite.

Instead of constantly looking like I have been awake for days at a time (even after getting 7-8 hours of sleep every night and using eye cream religiously), these make me look like I am alive and ready to take on the day.

I use them Friday nights after the work week is done. I leave them on for 10 minutes like the instructions say and I do feel like my under eye area is cooler and tighter after I remove these pads. My undereye area is definitely not as puffy. However, I havenu2019t noticed a huge decrease in dark circles. This is packaged as a large bag containing 8 individually packaged under eye gels. One of the individual packets I received came dried out (there was a hole in the packet I think) so check that because the pads wonu2019t stick when you use them (Sephora customer service was wonderful when I called in about this). Overall I like the product but would I spent another $33 for 8 packets? Not sure. I might try other brands first to see how they compare to this. Skyn is cruelty free though, so thatu2019s an added bonus to this company."

I tried these on a whim because they looked soothing. Iu2019ve used eye masks before (you know the ones that look like sleeping masks that you keep in the fridge?) but all those did was make my eyes feel better for a short time. I now use these Eye Gels at least once a week, usually on a Wednesday or Thursday as a mid-week refresher, and I find they not only make my under-eye area look smooth and refreshed, but more importantly they make my under-eye area feel smooth and refreshed.

I noticed an immediate difference in how my under eye area looked and was thrilled by the results at a time when my skin in general needed all the help it could get! I immediately ordered the 8 pack of eye gels. From a practical standpoint, the eye gels are the most comfortable to wear that I've tried, fit well, and stay put. I tend to save them for special occasions, or when my under eye area needs more of a boost than my daily eye treatments can give. I also leave them on for longer than the 10 minutes recommended.

Any fine lines or puffiness is instantly gone! As for dark circles under the eyes I didn't see a huge difference but I'm very fair without my tan in a can and tend to be purple around the eyes always. Highly highly recommend these!!"

The difference with the more expensive brands was the inclusion of a beautiful eye serum, which you would apply in advance. These ones do a lovely job without an eye serum at a fraction of the price, and when you add your own eye serum or cream, the effect is quite remarkable. If you like to use eye patches weekly like me, these are a great affordable alternative, and save the high end ones for special events!"

I was not impressed, it does feel nice and soothing but I did not notice any real transformation in the eye area. Perhaps you need to use it more consistently to notice a difference. A big pro was that it was non irritating to my very sensitive eye area but I'd personally go with a cold compress over the eye area next time."
