It opened with a sparkling burst of champagne and juicy floral fruits that struck me as very unique and beautiful, but these notes faded within ten minutes to a soft, creamy musk with floral undertones that smells exactly like Flowerbomb after 4-5 hours of drydown. Why five stars? I actually love Flowerbomb's drydown and have been searching for a perfume that matches this profile (I don't have the patience to sit through the initial florals, which are lovely but irritate my sensitive nose). I wish the champagne and fruits lasted longer, but it's still 5 stars for me because I really have been looking for this fragrance and can see myself wearing it often -- I just didn't expect to find it with Wedding Silk Santal. Those of you who prefer strong projection or are looking for a more unique champagne fragrance will probably want to skip this one."

Itu2019s a lighter version of vanilla 28 with a slightly more forward sweet musk. No depth. Itu2019s a pretty scent, nice if you want a lighter version of v28. The disappointment came from none of the described notes being in the fragrance  No champagne.No nectarine. I was expecting effervescent light fruity floral with. Tinge of her signature sweetness. I thought this would give fresh flirty grown up.   I wanted dolce and Gabbana light blue summer vibes with more champagne and sweetness, .It gives watery sweet vanilla. Again nice scent for a lighter version of v28. I like it. Just not what it advertised"

I'd probably buy it again, because it reminds me of a slightly fresher Burberry Goddess without the lavender, which is nice because sometimes that lavender is too distinct to me, and I love vanillas of all sorts. There's a distinct soap-y element to it if you put your nose close to it, which I think should be the advertised woodsiness, which I hope will die down as the perfume macerates and the vanilla profile rounds itself out, as vanillas tend to do. Sillage is impressive on clothing for Kayali, not so much on skin. I'm not getting fruitiness or champagne at all, but then again I've only had the perfume for not very long. Longevity is questionable at best, but I bought it in the travel size so I can have it in my purse for reapplication. Definitely not a safe blind buy, I think I prefer Vanilla 28 and the new Vanilla Candy Rock Sugar to this. Deduction of a star because the bottle came not completely filled, but that's a common issue with Kayali fragrances. The spray nozzle is somewhat atrocious at first, I had issues getting the bottle to properly depress. The spray is not fine, it comes out in a concentrated, haphazard spurt, which hopefully improves as I use it more since I feel like a more distributed mist would help with diffusing the soapiness in the scent and making it smell more well-blended."

Opens up sharp and very floral, with some aftershave note that doesnu2019t really blend too well with anything else in this composition. After a little while vanilla comes forward and this perfume changes to a completely different scent. Based on other reviews Iu2019m guessing it has Vanilla 28 base and thatu2019s what Iu2019m smelling within an hour or so of wear. Longevity and sillage are ok, it wears closer to skin unless you overspray your hair and clothing. Doesnu2019t project much when applied to skin. If you didnu2019t get it for some reason and never had it in your collection before, you are not missing out on anything. It is not with the hype. Alsou2026  as to other peopleu2019s comparisons of this scent to Dama Bianca. This doesnu2019t smell anything like it. I wish it did. It might be in the same family of vanilla fruity florals, but thatu2019s about it. DB is blended to perfection and is a master piece. So I suggest to get that instead, especially if you can snag it at a lower price"

This is an easy reach, compliment getting signature scent worthy fragrance that can be worn day or night and all year around. Silk Santal is a perfect blend of beautiful notes that have an expensive, sweet and classic essence. Longevity/performance meet my expectations for an EDP, 4-6 hours and longer if layered. There are a lot of likeable fragrances but it takes a lot for me to purchase a full size bottle. Silk Santal is one of the most worn, complimented and versatile fragrances in my curated collection of 12 or less full size bottles. I fell in love during the original release and bought two more bottles recently bc I love it so much. The hype is deserved and I hope this becomes a permanent offering from Kayai!"

I just took a shower and doused myself in it, to head to bed. My baby woke up and I had to tend to her for a bit and by the time I got back in bed itu2019s now a skin scent. So I went back and did 5 more sprays. Iu2019m hoping itu2019ll last longer now. Itu2019s unfortunate that it dissipates so quickly because itu2019s a pretty scent.  Nevertheless, I feel compelled to get it in a travel size so when I wear it and it vanishes, I can do a touch up. Itu2019s that lovely. Off to order a mini."

Wouldn't it make more sense to get rid of a fragrance they're not selling well and replace it with this as a permanent staple? This is as popular as Vanilla 28. They'd make even more money. This is the only perfume I'd ever repurchase from Kayali. Such a shame with this marketing."

This opens bright, fizzy, effervescent, softly sweet, fruity, and floral. As it dries down the amber-y vanilla becomes more prominent. It also deepens some and becomes more woody, sweeter, warmer, creamier, and more musky. This is where it really begins to truly shine for me. The delicate, warm, creamy, and woody sweetness of the vanilla, amberwood, and sandalwood blend so beautifully together with touches of sweet orange blossom and softly powdery musk. You become enveloped in the most gorgeous, elegant, sensual, and cozy scent bubble.   The notes that are the most prominent to me are the champagne, nectarine, orange blossom, vanilla, sugar, sandalwood, musk, and amberwood. The champagne and nectarine fade into these other notes the more it dries down making them more subtle, but they still whisper throughout the entire wear.   This is such a truly incredible fragrance that I find to be very wearable and a very easy reach. I think that it would be hard to not love this one. I think it works very nicely for year round wear as well as basically any occasion. It would make such a lovely signature fragrance. I also think that this one is a pretty safe blind buy. I'm so very happy to have it as part of my collection, it's one of my top favorites.   I get excellent performance with The Wedding Silk Santal, just like I do with all of my Kayali fragrances. The longevity is really impressive, it lasts the entire day and I can still smell it the next morning. The projection is very nice too, it radiates out at least a few feet from me. I only need a few spritzes to get this effect, so I do consider it to be a good value."

However, the atomizer is different from what I'm accustomed to from the Kayali line. Instead of the expected fine mist, it delivers a splash of perfume, leading to a more substantial amount being dispensed with each spray. It's difficult to control the amount of perfume I want to apply, as the splash is more generous than intended, and I have to be more cautious in my usage. As a result, I find myself running through this bottle faster than expected. Nonetheless, if you're willing to overlook this aspect and prioritize the fragrance, it's worth a try."

I could only bring myself to buy a travel size bottle of vanilla 28 bc to my nose itu2019s a dense, resinous, lightly spiced dark vanilla. Itu2019s way too heavy to be worn in the summer heat to me. The Wedding Silk is on the other end of the spectrum. It opens with that familiar baccarat rouge 540 dna, then a sweet musk swoops in but not the Kayali musk scent used in the u201cMusku201d perfume, itu2019s more similar to Ellis Brooklynu2019s u201cMythu201d musk (so good btw). Thereu2019s also some beautiful florals in there that I canu2019t identify easily but theyu2019re def not the star of the show, just enough to add some delicate femininity in there. The final dry down phases are for sure vanilla, a creamy, velvety but somehow also airy, sweet vanilla, more closely related to Good Girl Blush than vanilla 28. I wore the sample I purchased for a day and had multiple compliments with people needing to know what I was wearing. I ordered the full size bottle at midnight on the day it was released. The scent is romantic and sophisticated, it will be in my top scents in my collection for sure."
