            "review_text": "absolutely love this product. my skin is combo & it really depends what i'm using on my skin how much oil/ dryness it has. i've been using Tower28 SOS spray, serum, & moisturizer & its been working wonders on clearing my minimal but stubborn acne/ clogged pores, but it really dries my skin out. i tried using Inky List Hyaluronic Acid & Innisfree Green Tea Seed Hyaluronic Acid Cream but my skin was still dry & flaky the next morning.  i also have VERY sensitive skin. most products make my skin feel tingly with a mild burning sensation. i'm also allergic to ethylenediamine & parabens so i look for products free from that. i came across Biossance Overnight Repair Cream & wow, heaven. my skin does NOT feel like it burning when i apply it. does not tingle at all. just a super fresh cool gel feeling. i love it. my skin is also not dry & flaky in the morning. i also use this as a daytime moisturizer. it's lightweight & absorbs quickly, does not leave your face looking oily & shiny. a very nice healthy glow.   GET THIS !!"
