My skin appears more glowy and even than itu2019s been looking lately, and I didnu2019t change anything else in my routine. I donu2019t have many fine lines or wrinkles yet due to consistent retinol use and sun protection (32 years old), so I canu2019t comment on line reduction. I did notice a bit of irritation after the second use, but a soothing mask alleviated that. I donu2019t consider that a negative; itu2019s normal when going up in strength with a retinol serum to have some irritation.

My skin peeled on day 3 as I cleaned it with my normal oil cleanser. Not unexpected. I used a warm wet wash cloth to help remove the dead skin. My skin peeled again a few days later but it was lessened. This was only after 2 uses. My skin was a little sensitive following the peeling. No major redness occurred. I've been very careful in the sun; sun screen and hats. I feel like my skin is smoother and softer overall. My neck looks amazing- I swear the wrinkles there are faded. I'm curious if the wrinkles in my forehead will lessen the longer I use the product. I highly recommend following the instructions when using retinol. Maybe try the .3% if this is your first time. I use this product at night after washing and toning followed up with a moisturizer. Recommend!"

Over a few weeks, I noticed a significant improvement in my skin's texture, reduction in fine lines, and a more even skin tone. It absorbs well without leaving a greasy residue, making it easy to incorporate into my nighttime routine. Overall, this treatment has delivered visible results and has become a key part of my skincare regimen."

I recently got into Paula's Choice because I really liked their branding on Sephora.com and thought it was worth a try. I love that each product is numbered so it's easy to put together a routine. This retinol treatment was one of my more recent purchases, and I am OBSESSED. I've never used such a hydrating retinol with such immediate results. My skin looks brighter, acne scars faded and fine lines are barely there. Even my esthetician asked what I was doing differently because my skin looks so good. I was able to switch over most of my routine to this and some other PC products with zero irritation or purging. I use this in the evenings with the Barrier Repair Moisturizer and their SPF and the Vitamin C + Glutathione Clinical Serum in the mornings. I've never felt better in my own skin!"

I also noticed that my forehead wrinkles/fine lines looked more smooth. I think this also has to do with the fact that the treatment is very moisturizing and luminizing!

I previously used Skinceuticals 0.3 (which is a 0.3% retinol concentration), I was ready to up the ante and try something stronger. This formulation, with the addition of Licorice (good for brightening) struck me as a good choice. First of all it's quite hydrating. If you have dry to normal skin this will suit you just fine. For myself being oily I had to use it very lightly so as not to over-hydrate my skin. The packaging - although good for keeping the ingredients stable was quite annoying as I always found it dispensed either too little or too much with each pump. As with other retinol formulations I did notice a difference in both pore size and skin texture and in a fairly short amount of time. Additionally there was also a very slight difference to fine lines which I can only put down to the impressive choice of ingredients in here. I had been expecting to peel or notice redness but luckily that did not happen. The downside is the silicone content. I could only use this once or twice a week at most without experiencing a breakout. In itself it's a great product provided you are ok with silicones.

            "review_text": "I had been using a French pharmacy retinol formula (A313) for several months before starting this one. A313 contains 0.12% retinol esters, basically a very mild formula which still gave me good results. Itu2019s a thick pomade that feels very u201cactiveu201d on the skin, becoming warm and slightly itchy/burning after application, especially for the first few weeks (I was waiting the recommended 10-15 minutes after washing face to apply it). Over time I worked my way up to using it 5-6 nights a week and was pleased with the results  I felt like it was time to step it up to a stronger formula though as Iu2019m approaching 30 and heard good things about this Paulau2019s Choice retinol serum. At a 1% concentration of retinol, I expected more stinging/burning than I was used to with the A313. But the first night using it, I noticed how little irritation there was in comparison. So I went ahead and applied it pretty heavily the next night and the night after that. Day 4 is when it all caught up with me. My skin began peeling like CRAZY and felt very raw and more sensitive/dry than it ever has for 48 hrs+. I stopped using the serum of course, and only now on day 6 is my skin calming down and getting back to normal  Needless to say I definitely overdid it those first few nights expecting the same kind of immediate irritation I was used to with A313. At this strength the retinol is definitely more of a u201cslow burneru201d and may take a couple days to take full effect, which I now know! With that said, Iu2019m giving this 5 stars because my skin does look great today and the peeling means itu2019s doing its job. Just be sure to start out SLOW if youu2019re new to retinol at this concentration. Iu2019ll probably wait a few more days before I feel safe to use it again, but will update my review once Iu2019ve safely and effectively worked it into my routine. Love Paulau2019s Choice and love that this has Vitamin C and Peptides in it as well. Great product but use with proper caution!"

Now I still have an ugly black scar on my face (pic 2). Be very careful if you are first time user!  I contacted Sephora customer service and showed them my skin condition in an attempt to return the product but experienced coldness.

My skin is used to retinol products, but I still used a great moisturizer with this one, just in case. I have experienced zero irritation, redness, or peeling from the cream; but, do start slowly if this is a new product or ingredient for your skin. This is a great product from Paula's Choice, and it's one that I will keep in my routine-- a true anti-aging multitasker that slowly releases its active ingredient over time for the maximum benefit.

Some companies may promise a higher percentage of retinol, but it's important to look for the word complex or encapsulated - which may suggest that product is not actually at the high percentage claimed.  Paula's Choice chose a more direct route - the highest OTC level recommended (it's 1%) with no games, plus the inclusion of peptide ingredients to boost rejuvenating results. The product is fragrance-free and presents a yellow color, as expected from the retinol ingredient.  On my skin, which is pretty adjusted to retinoid products, there is absolutely no irritation and instead only great results in terms of smoothing and clarity. I do want to note that it is important to start with a pea size amount of this product, and if you're unsure of whether your skin will be able to handle it, apply it AFTER a light moisturizer, and follow that with a heavier moisturizer (the sandwich method).  Gifted by Paula's Choice, all my own opinions."

As someone who has been on the hunt for an effective retinol treatment, I can confidently say that this product delivers impressive results.

This high percentage ensures that you are getting a potent dose of retinol that can truly make a difference in your skin's appearance. What sets Paula's Choice CLINICAL 1% Retinol Treatment apart from other retinol products is its unique delivery system. The treatment is encapsulated in a light, silky texture that glides on smoothly and absorbs quickly into the skin. This allows for maximum effectiveness and minimizes the risk of irritation or dryness often associated with retinol usage. Additionally, I appreciate the inclusion of antioxidants and soothing ingredients in the formulation. These ingredients help to counteract any potential irritation and provide added benefits for the skin. I found that my skin felt nourished and calmed after applying the treatment, which is a huge plus.If you are looking to address signs of aging and improve the overall health of your skin, I highly recommend giving this treatment a try."

It is a stronger retinol cream so unfortunately it's not for all skin types especially sensitive. I've seen multiple bad reviews of people using this product and then saying it doesn't work. It does work....just not for your skin type.   Secondly I've read a few reviews about breakouts while using this product. Breakouts are normal and actually show the product is working its called skin purging.   And third...retinol doesn't work instantaneously even though everyone wants results right now! It took probably about 6 months or longer of using this product before I noticed results. I noticed recently my forehead fine lines have smoothed out and my dark spots and redness on my cheeks are gone.   I also want to add that having a good skin care routine (washing, toning, exfoliating,moisturizing) helps the product or any product absorb better into the skin. I didn't realize this until later on and lots of research.   I absolutely recommend this product 100% if it fits into your skin criteria!"

I'm able to use this now about 3-4 times per week without any problems. I began with 2 times per week the first 3-4 weeks and ramped up to where I am now. I use a dense night cream to seal in everything and find no problem with my skin barrier. I am deliberating on purchasing a second bottle of this once my current one runs out because I'm curious to see how effective this is with repeated, longer sustained use. It also checks the box on being cruelty-free -- a non-negotiable for me when I purchase any product now. As someone who has used retinol for about a decade, I can attest to this one being an efficacious and reliable product to help with the aging process by making my skin smoother and brighter."

But no matter how I tried to use this; skin cycling, mixing it with moisturizer, putting it over moisturizer, adding my thiccckest moisturizer as a sandwich, didn't matter, it burned the hell out of the sensitive parts of my face. It worked a treat on rest of my face, hence the 5 stars, but I had to find something a little less robust. I'll try it for summer or if my skin barrier is feeling especially bullet-proof, but if you are prone to any dry spots or skin barrier disruption, even if you tolerate other retinols well, you might want to get a sample or something before purchasing."

And yes i felt my  skin  a stinging sensation, so i use Cicaplast from La Roche Posay before retinol over the more sensitive parts like the nose, lips and eyes, then retinol and after 20 minutes i use Tolerance lotion from avene, and i donu2019t like the farmacy stuff, but believe me, those stuff keep my on my retinol journey without irritation or break outs. The mineral water it is really good to keep the irritation away. So i felt in one month my skin very nice, less pores, the dark spots are amazingly cleared up, the texture is the best i had in years.
