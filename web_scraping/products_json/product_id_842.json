I will say that the Kate Somerville EradiKate was helpful in drying the breakout areas.  However, the consistency is weird and wasteful: when you dip your Qtip in, the product comes out with huge clumps - and it goes on your skin like that too.  In comparison, Mario Badescu\u2019s Drying Lotion does the same job, if not better, and the product comes out in a nice consistency, goes on evenly instead of in clumps, and helps to dry the surface of your skin.  So the product goes a lot farther than the EradiKate will.  Considering that the Mario Badescu is $24 and the Kate Somerville product is $38, I would never ever recommend the EradiKate!  Go for the tried and true Mario Badescu Drying Lotion!"

I had a huge period / stress pimple brewing on the side of my face - right before a party, of course. The day of the party, my pimple was peak drama - huge, red, and angry, and starting to come to a head. It was going to be really difficult to cover with makeup. I rummaged through my skincare stash and found EradiKate - dipped a cotton swab in to get the pink stuff, and dabbed it right on the pimple. TWO HOURS LATER, the pus/oil/blood that had been coming to a head had been drawn out. (I saw it had seeped out through the pink stuff.) I got a cotton ball this time, wet it with warm water, and gently rubbed away the pink stuff and the pus/oil/blood. The pimple was still there, but a) the stuff at the surface had been drawn out, and b) the swelling had gone down considerably. It was SO much easier to cover, and was no issue for me during my party. Note that this was the only time I applied the treatment. The next day, the size and redness had come down even more, and now on day two, it's healed significantly. Without the application of this product, it would typically take my skin about a week to recover from this type of pimple. This will be a must-have for me moving forward! I highly, highly recommend."

This product is awful, especially for dry skin and you can get so much better at the same price point.

This spot treatment is the best spot treatment I\u2019ve ever tried. I have tried almost every spot treatment under the sun, including Mario Badescu\u2019s version of this and it\u2019s just not the same. I\u2019m not saying this will magically make your pimple disappear within a matter of 10 minutes, but pimples that took over a week or two to heal, now only take a few days at max to mostly or completely disappear. However, it is very drying as other reviews have stated and so the surrounding area of the pimple has a tendency to become flaky and dry too (beware if you have dry skin already). My only complaint is that you do look a bit odd with little spots on your face ultimately meaning this can only be used at night if you have places to be during the day. I\u2019d love if a more day-friendly version was available. Otherwise, I highly recommend if you\u2019re looking for a good and fast spot treatment!"

Works well, just be careful and be prepared for dryness which makes it card to cover the blemish."

For smaller pimples, this seems to be really effective at shrinking them overnight and by the second or third day they are gone. For larger/more stubborn spots, I can see that they shrink down but come back throughout the day so it takes longer for this product to work. I don't mind the pink colour as I'm a SAHM and online nursing student, so I will often apply in the morning as well to the larger spots. I love the smell!!!

After some experimentation, I realized that to get the most out of it at nighttime, it works best if you put a hydrocolloidal patch on top (not the medicated ones, just plain ones from Amazon or the pharmacy). This dries into a sort of chalk, so the patch keeps it in place at night and absorbs any excess oils."

Dont do that it will make it worse) -This product can last you forever!!! Only dip the qtip in a bit not all the way down, u dont need that much product, and when the alcohol starts getting low put your own 70% alcohol -works waayy better for me than the mario badecu I would Give it 5 star if it worked on cystic acne"

The first night, the product didnt even stay on, it had completely rubbed off. I returned it and went with the other option i had been humming over when i originally picked this. The Origins Super Spot Remover. THIS one worked waaaaay better for me. It significantly decreased the size after one night.

I AM NOT KIDDING - it has been the ONLY thing that gets rid of my painful cystic acne within days. My break outs could get pretty bad, deep-rooted and painful with puss at times - ever since I started using this product though, my acne has not only reduced/dried up within a day or two, but also is not able to get that bad or go that far to be painful anymore. I don't get painful puss-full acne anymore because it's already reduces and goes away within a few days. Sometimes when I apply it on some areas of my face it'll sting for the first 5 seconds but then that goes away and it kind of just shows me it's working. I use this product specifically on the larger breakouts I have and then also apply it on the redness areas and I have seen a sigificant change in my skin since I've begun using it. I don't even think my prescription acne ointment works this efficiently at drying out the acne without drying out the rest of your skin/face. I would definitely recommend for anyone who is/has struggled with painful acne for a long time. I've had cystic acne for a few years now but it's finally cleared up enough (with regular use of this & Sephora's AHA night cream) that I can work on healing and clearing redness and acne scars and don't gotta struggle with painful acne every other day anymore. I still do get pimples (especially if I stop using this for a few days on new acne) but this product really helps to keep them at bay and lets my skin heal and clear up with the reduced amount of painful and deep rooted cystic acne. The reason why I took 1 star off is because when I use it around my nose or forehead, I guess because of the strong smell in it, sometimes my eyes get watery/sensitive. Additionally, once the liquid part of the product finishes, the pink part by itself isn't as effective. Other than this, this is honestly a game changer!"

By using these products be aware that it does not treat, only reduces on the surface, so the pimple may still be there deep. I would only recommend this for small surface blemishes.

After 5 mins the pink solution dries up and hardens. Then I apply any other serums and end with a gentle moisturizer. I know how it feels to feel super insecure about having redness from acne.

I believe I\u2019ve been using this product for about 3 weeks straight. I am so happy with my skin. I am not sure if Ordinary Niacin product is helping me with my acne scars or this product is but I am in love with the results. Btw, if you\u2019re like me and used a lot of spot treatments etc, this is one of those products that is evident you have something on your face and it dries/peels off your skin at night depending on how you sleep. You might find some pink flakes in your pillow. However, it is not drying at all. I have dry skin easily and this doesn\u2019t dry me out. Thank god. What\u2019s worst than acne is a dried face with white flakes."

However, after cutting it out of my routine (because of the isopropyl alcohol, which is an incredibly irritating & drying ingredient, especially for sensitive acne-prone skin), I realized that it really hasn't made much difference in how long my breakouts typically last. In fact, I think the reason I continued to use it for as long as I did is because there's something satisfying about covering up pimples with a spot treatment - it seems like it's doing something, because it hides the problem, until you wash it off of course.  I honestly feel a little betrayed after reading that isopropyl alcohol is the second ingredient listed in this product. If alcohol is listed as one of the first 6 ingredients, this is a bad sign. Even for normal skin types, this kind of alcohol seriously weakens and aggravates the skin. So any short-term benefits one might see are seriously outweighed by the long-term negative effects of using such harsh ingredients."

I put eradikate on when I feel like I\u2019m getting a bump, and it works like a dream. I\u2019ve only had 1 pimple grow out a little, but it grew out already dried and not painful or big and red. The only problem is once it grows out it still leaves a little scar. I normally get about 3-4 pimples a week, I\u2019ve been using this product for 2 weeks and have only had 1 pimple grow out. This product completely eradicated the rest that were trying to grow!  Weird pro tip - I take the cotton off the Q-tip and leave just the stick, because the cotton soaks up the liquid part so without the cotton soaking it up the bottle will last you much longer!

I recently purchased the Kate Somerville acne sample kit and, I'll admit, I was pretty hesitant that it would actually do anything. However, I was completely surprised at how effective this treatment was and how quickly it worked! I'm leaving a review for this particular item because  out of the entire kit, this was the game changer. I had been using Nizoral for about ~2 weeks with decent results, but once I started using this sulphur acne treatment, all of the stubborn fungal acne started to disappear. Also, if I felt like I was about to break out in a spot, I would just put this treatment on the area overnight and it would either make it go away or bring it to a head. Incredible stuff!"

Best done when home or overnight as it smells terrible (on day of use and following day after washed off.) It's especially great on my husband's beard area as he frequently gets blemishes under his chin and neck area. With a cotton swab he dabs a bit of EradiKate on, lets it set, then rinses later, and by the following day the pimples are diminished and drying out. I like it for myself with the occasional breakout (I'm in my 40s and still get zits, sigh.) NB: Bottles have an expiration date so when you purchase in store watch for this and pick a long date!"

Sulfur is medicinal and super healing that\u2019s why I love this stuff. This is good for people who get pimples here and there so mild to moderate acne. I had a bottle of this stuff last for 2 years so it\u2019s worth the price. Also when you see the alcohol depleting just add rubbing alcohol to the bottle to keep the pink sulfur from drying.  In the morning just wash it off and adjust how often you use this product based on your skin sensitivity. This product is so worth it."

I have had periods of time where my skin has been clear on antibiotics, but the past year I have been managing with just over the counter products and an LED light panel (which I HIGHLY recommend anyone with acne should use). Recently though my chin has decided to breakout badly. Seriously woke up with new zits every morning. It felt like I was in high school again which is super frustrating. I was considering going back on antibiotics but thought I'd take my aesthetician's advice and give EradiKate a try for flare ups. The difference overnight was dramatic honestly. It smells life sulfur and shows up pink on your face, but if you are going to sleep does it matter?? I am so happy I found this product to use in case my face decides to go crazy. It is drying so be sure to moisturize the next day! Its also not meant for your whole face and I don't think its meant to be a long term cure, but it you have really bad breakouts that are random and concentrated in one or two spots, this is perfect. It dries them right up and lightens the dark spot that is left after. Seriously try it!!"

Since I started using this a month ago, it has cleared my skin up and I am happy with my results. My skin is hardly red anymore, I hardly get pimples anymore, and I don't have acne scars after using this. I will say that this does have a smell, mostly because it is 10% Sulfur and Sulfur is some smelly stuff! However, that smell goes away after 10 minutes. The only reason why I am giving it 4 stars is because it flakes off a bit if you leave it on overnight and can leave a pink residue on your pillow. I love this stuff, it is a definite game-changer; but my skin is also oily and very tough. If you have sensitive skin I would STAY AS FAR AWAY FROM THIS PRODUCT AS POSSIBLE! It can be harsh and potentially break you out if you have a sensitivity to Isopropyl Alcohol."

I don't know if it's solely due to this product, but I've also experienced a decrease in the amount of hormonal pimples I get and have noticed an overall improvement in my skin.   The only reason why I took away one star is because this product dries out your skin a lot (as it should), so overuse can actually damage your skin and make it look worse.  Moderation is key with this product, and it works really well as a spot treatment and on pesky hormonal acne."

I am on my second bottle and the thing that helps with not using it up as quickly is to run your q-tip under water then give it a quick press to get some water out. That helps the sulphur and calamine stick to the exterior of the q-tip rather than absorbing it all the way down where you can't use it and end up wasting product.   The reason I added in cystic acne is that even though it's deep under the skin this helps to unclog the pore, when I do a hot compress and this over a couple days my cystic acne comes up much quicker. And for fellow PD sufferers you know how hard it is to find anything that doesn't make it worse and while I can't say for certain this will work for everyone since we all have different triggers it has worked for me, if you haven't tried it you should consider it for perioral dermatitis."

Wash your face, let dry and then spot treat the infected areas. The rest of your face put the creamy acne med, let dry, then add moisturizer, but not the spotted parts. It took about 2 days for them to shrink, but not gone. After about 1 week 1/2 my face is nearly clear with only tiny bumps that are still working to go away completely. This keeps my cystic acne under control and/or away. I would suffer from one going away and then others would pop up together with no break at times. Give this a shot it won't hurt you."

I always take a bit of toner and swab the area I'm about to treat before applying this to make sure it has a clean surface for maximum effectiveness. Oh, and DO NOT shake! lol, every sample jar in the stores has obviously been shaken because they are always hard as a rock.

As of right now I have at least 10 blemishes on my face. I read about this and noticed that this is common for women in their 20\u2019s and 30\u2019s. I read about what products can help with this and saw Kate Somerville Eradikate on the list. Luckily my sister purchased this product a few months ago, so I was able to give it a go before deciding if I wanted to purchase it for myself. I have been using the product for 2 days now and I do notice a difference. My blemishes are smaller and less red. They are not completely gone, but the type of blemishes I have on my jawline are large and hard, so they will take some time to go away. If you are dealing with adult acne like I am I would definitely give this product a try. It seems to be working well."

Just a dab as soon as you feel a cystic bump, worn overnight, and it shrinks them drastically so they're almost gone in a few days. Instead of having to deal with a growing cystic bump for 4-6 weeks, it's gone in less than one. I use it on every pimple that tries to pop up. The sulfur smell can be a little strong, but it's not overwhelming and is worth it for what it does to keep my pimples from getting out of control.
