The app makes it seem like you will be getting the full dermaroller (and I have the screenshots to prove it before anyone tries to call me a liar). I'd love to contact Sephora about it, but their live chat option isn't actually ever available, and I only check it during times that it is supposed to be active. I don't know why they lie about having a live chat option when they actually don't. I can't call them currently due to issues with my phone. Last I will be ordering from Sephora. It is wild that it is 2024 and they still don't have their app configured correctly so that you get the correct item information from it. So embarrassing for such a big company. What a shady company."

Every one of their products Iu2019ve tried has been fantastic quality and theyu2019ve never been too heavy for my fine hair, which is amazing. So I when I found out they were coming out with a dermaroller I knew immediately that it was something that I needed to try. The tool itself feels substantial and very well made in your hand. And I love how wide the roller is - it requires less passes, so I donu2019t feel like Iu2019m rushing towards the end and can be as careful and deliberate as I would like to be the whole way through without getting bored or my arms getting tired. It doesnu2019t hurt or cause any discomfort and my scalp feels really healthy since Iu2019ve added it to my routine.

It took about half the time with this than I usually spend rolling my scalp because of the large head. Which means my hands are less tired when Iu2019m done. I dermaroll my scalp religiously because of all the things Iu2019ve tried for hair loss and regrowth I feel itu2019s produced the best effect. I love that this comes in a beautiful case that looks like itu2019s for expensive sunglasses unlike most scalp rollers that come in the standard plastic case. The head is replaceable which is also a huge plus. It rolls seamlessly and smoothly. If you do it correctly it wonu2019t pull out hair. It has a high end cost but it performs and looks high end.

This tool gently exfoliates the scalp, perfectly prepping it for Vegamour's GRO+ Advanced Hair Serum. The wide head covers a lot of area quickly, making the process efficient. The twist-on, twist-off design is super convenient, and the included protective carry case is a nice touch. It's great that replacement heads are easy to swap out monthly for optimal results. Overall, a fantastic addition to my hair care routine!"

Iu2019ll be honest at first it was a little uncomfortable, but after using it for a week you get the hang of it.
