Before switching to this innisfree serum I was using Paulau2019s choice vitamin c cream as well as their formula with glutathione, so my skin was already accustomed to vitamin c when I decided to go for the innisfree at a lower price point. I donu2019t think this gives the same u201dbouncinessu201d or hydration as PC did but my skin definitely feels radiant and I think the green tea enzyme has been helping reduce texture/congestion. It is a great mid-range priced vitamin c option if your skin does well with it."

However, I did experience a bit of irritation around my sensitive areas, like under my eyes, the first couple of times I applied it. It wasnu2019t unbearable, but I had to be careful to avoid those spots, and I started using it less frequently to give my skin time to adjust. After a few days, the irritation subsided, and I was able to use it regularly without any further issues.  I would still highly recommend this serum to anyone looking to brighten their skin and get an even complexion, but if you have sensitive skin like mine, you might want to patch test first or ease into daily use."

From the moment I started incorporating it into my daily skincare routine, I noticed significant changes in my complexion.  The serum comes in a sleek, easy-to-use bottle, and the texture is just divine. It's lightweight, absorbs quickly, and doesn't leave any sticky residue, making it perfect for both my morning and evening routines. I have sensitive skin, so I'm always cautious about introducing new products, but this serum was gentle yet effective.  Within a few weeks, I started to see a noticeable difference in my skin's texture and tone. My complexion appears brighter, more radiant, and the dark spots from past acne scars are visibly reduced. It's as if my skin has a new lease on life!  What I appreciate the most about Innisfree's Vitamin C serum is its formulation. It's packed with natural ingredients, and being from a brand known for its commitment to sustainability, it feels good to support a company that cares about the environment as much as it does about skincare.  If you're on the fence about trying a Vitamin C serum, I couldn't recommend this product enough. It's a game-changer for anyone looking to brighten their complexion and even out their skin tone. Innisfree has truly outdone themselves with this serum, and it's a staple in my skincare routine now. Thank you, Sephora, for carrying such a fantastic product!"

This product has quickly become a staple in my skincare routine and I can't imagine my skincare routine without it.  First of all, the ingredients in this serum are top-notch. Green tea is known for its antioxidant properties, which help to fight off free radicals and protect the skin from environmental damage. Vitamin C is an essential nutrient for the skin, helping to brighten and even out the skin tone. The combination of these two ingredients in this serum is truly a powerhouse for skin health.  The texture of the serum is lightweight and absorbs quickly into the skin. It doesn't leave any sticky or tacky residue behind, which is a huge plus in my book. I love how it feels on my skin and how easily it works into my routine.  After using this serum for a few weeks, I have noticed a significant improvement in the overall brightness and clarity of my skin. My complexion looks more even and radiant, and my skin tone is more balanced. I have also noticed that any dark spots or hyperpigmentation I had have started to fade away. My skin looks healthier and more youthful than ever before.  I also appreciate that this serum is cruelty-free and made with natural ingredients. It gives me peace of mind knowing that I am using a product that is good for my skin and good for the environment.  Overall, I cannot recommend the Green Tea Enzyme Vitamin C Brightening Serum enough. It has truly transformed my skin and I will continue to repurchase it for as long as I can. If you're looking for a serum that will brighten and rejuvenate your skin, look no further than this amazing product."

I liked that the bottle and cap was made of mostly recycled materials and that it is glass. This serum helps to visibly smooth smooth and fade the appearance of dark spots for a more even toned refined complexion. I like to use it in my routine before my moisturizer. If you use this serum in the AM be sure to wear sunscreen I prefer using it in my PM routine. It wore well under my other skincare but since it is a fast absorbing serum it wasnu2019t really one I could use my other face tools with (like a jade roller).

Iu2019ve personally been a fan of their products since I studied abroad in Seoul in 2011 - they are effective and high quality at a great price point (please donu2019t change, Innisfree!) Anyway, this Vitamin C brightening serum is quite good. Iu2019ve used u201cmedical gradeu201d (Skinceuticals CE Ferulic), drugstore, and a few mid range vitamin Cs and this is one of the couple I would repurchase. I personally feel that this serum is nearly tied with Skinceuticals in terms of Vitamin Cu2019s Iu2019ve actually observed benefit from. I love the lightweight and almost watery texture, which is unique compared to any other Vitamin C serum Iu2019ve tried. Itu2019s non-sticky, lays well under SPF and makeup, and gives my skin an immediate healthy glow without making it oily. The opaque glass bottle is a plus to me as well. Iu2019ve used it for less than a month so I canu2019t speak to long term differences in complexion brightening. I do observe my skin instantly glowing after application and have noticed more even tone in the time Iu2019ve consistently used this product."

I used this product in the morning. I found that it absorbed into my skin quickly and I could apply other products on top (i.e. sunscreen) without experiencing any pilling. In the few weeks that I have been using it, I do think that my complexion has brightened up but I can't say that it did much for my hyperpigmentation.  I enjoyed using this serum and I may purchase in the future."

It is very lightweight, and the finish is non-sticky and non-greasy at all. The serum helps to 'awaken' my skin in the morning, making it brighter and adding a beautiful healthy glow. It exfoliates the skin very gently and never causes me any irritation, unlike some other exfoliators. The serum fades dark spots, smooths rough texture, and reduces dullness, leaving my skin radiant and hydrated. I can see immediate effects with this serum.

This serum has water soluble and oil soluble vitamin C derivatives as well as green tea enzyme which aid in helping with appearance of dark spots, dullness and rough skin texture. I find this has definitely been helping with lightening up those dark spots and also evening out my skins texture since I started using it. Also with getting older my skin has been losing its elasticity and I need to stay on top of it more. Iu2019ve noticed the white spots around my mouth and chin are popping up less frequently.

As an East Asian, I've always been a big fan of K-Beauty and Korean skincare products, even before they were introduced to North American stores like Sephora and Hudson's Bay. Innisfree is one of my tried, tested, and true brands!   I've always been a big fan of their Jeju Island Green Tea Seed product line so, I was ecstatic when I received the new Green Tea Enzyme Vitamin C Brightening Serum to review!  I was disappointed that it didn't have that distinct and lovable green tea scent! In fact, it had no scent at all! Which I guess is good if you're looking for an unscented serum.  Scent aside, I absolutely loved this product for me! I love how easy the dropper was to use and that it only takes a few drops per area on my face. I also love how easily it absorbed into my skin! My skin feels soft and looks bright & youthful! Added bonus, the serum even looks bright and bubbly with its little yellow bubbles/beads! I highly recommend!  #freeproduct #gotitfree #trywithtopbox #notsponsored"

Applied topically, it can protect your skin from external elements and free radicals, repair, and brighten up the skin, plus shielding it from any future damage.  This product contains double the benefits of a brightening serum along side as a clarifying serum and with the antioxidant benefits of Vitamin C and JeJu Green Tea Enzyme.    This pretty, translucent serum with gold flecks is housed in a opaque glass dropper bottle.  Dispensing the right amount of product for your face, it has this lighweight, slippery texture that feels non-greasy on the skin. Unscented.  Absorbing quickly, it has a slightly tacky after feel that soon dries down to a skin-like finish.    Perfect for all skin types and gentle enough for sensitive skin.    Improving the appearance of your skin in as little as 4 weeks by evening out your skin tone, skin texture, and revitalizing the overall look of your skin. Great for diminishing blemishes.  My Thoughts: I have been using this for several weeks now and for a Vitamin C serum, it's extremely gentle on the skin and I have dry, sensitive skin.  My skin felt immensely hydrated and plump afterwards.  It looks radiant too.  Love it!   Thank you Topbox Circle and Innisfree for giving me the opportunity to try this #freeproduct !!! "

First impression is this is a lovely lightweight serum which feels amazing on the skin and absorbs nicely. No notable scent (yay). I used it in the morning after cleansing and before my daily moisturizer. The brightening is absolutely apparent right away. I did notice some orange appearance within the serum after a couple days use which implies the dropper might lead to quicker oxidization so I have to knock off a star for that.   I did not see any material change in dark spots (I have freckles) but this is not my main skincare concern. I was really happy with how this felt on my skin and had no bad reaction whatsoever so I really think this could be good for most skin types.   The price is a little higher than I expected. But not crazy. Would rate this 3.5 stars.   #freeproduct"

This serum is nothing short of a revitalizing elixir for achieving radiant and luminous skin.  First and foremost, the ingredient list of this serum is impressive. Green tea and vitamin C are well-known for their antioxidant properties, and this serum combines them seamlessly to create a powerful formula. The green tea extract soothes the skin and reduces inflammation, while the vitamin C works to brighten and even out the skin tone.  One of the standout features of this serum is its lightweight and non-greasy texture. It effortlessly glides onto the skin, absorbing quickly without leaving any residue. This makes it perfect for both morning and evening use, seamlessly fitting into my daily skincare routine.  After using the Green Tea Enzyme Vitamin C Brightening Serum for a few weeks, I've noticed a significant improvement in the overall brightness and clarity of my complexion. My skin looks more even-toned, and the serum has helped reduce the appearance of dark spots and hyperpigmentation. The subtle glow it imparts is truly remarkable, giving my skin a youthful and healthy appearance.  I also appreciate the eco-friendly packaging of the product, aligning with the brand's commitment to sustainability. The pump dispenser ensures easy and hygienic application while preserving the potency of the ingredients.  In conclusion, the Green Tea Enzyme Vitamin C Brightening Serum has become a staple in my skincare routine. If you're in search of a serum that not only addresses dark spots and uneven skin tone but also provides a refreshing and nourishing experience, this serum is undoubtedly worth trying. Say hello to a brighter, more radiant complexion with this fantastic skincare gem"

My skin often does not respond quickly to product. But with this serum, it was different. Right next day I saw that my skin was more radiant. I mostly use it at night . when i use it in the morning, i use spf. I use about 3 drops. The droplet pipette was good, no issue. No scent to the product, which was great. Nice yellow specs suspended in the clear liquid. I would buy this item. I find it better than hylauronic serum that i'm using. can't speak for the hyperpigmentation, its only been 2 weeks. I'm eager to see what it does"

If you're new to the world of vitamin C, you can't go wrong trying the Vitamin C Green Tea Enzyme Brightening Serum.  With a dropper to allow for precise control and application, a few drops is what you need for your face and neck. The serum itself is lightweight, clear, and friendly to those of us with oily skin. It absorbs quickly into the skin, and most importantly, it doesn't leave behind any greasy residue or oiliness. In addition, it has no scent, so you can freely layer on additional products if needed.  Now, in terms of its star ingredient, vitamin C: It has worked well to help brighten my complexion. I can visibly see the reduction in redness, blemishes, and other minor marks. However, when it comes to a significant reduction in dark spots or hyperpigmentation, the verdict is still out. I haven't noticed any of the darkest of sunspots disappearing, but that may also be because it takes literally months for hyperpigmentation to fade via tropical methods. It's why it is important to have patience and play the long game when it comes to this factor.  Another thing to note is that this serum is strong, so I wouldn't recommend applying it three or four nights in a row. Start by using it twice a week and gradually bump up the usage to three and then four times a week as your skin's tolerance levels grow."

With continued use, I've noticed a significant improvement in the overall clarity and luminosity of my complexion. Plus, the subtle citrus scent adds a refreshing touch to my skincare ritual.  In conclusion, I highly recommend the Innisfree Green Tea Enzyme Vitamin C Brightening Serum to anyone looking to achieve a brighter, more radiant complexion.

My first impression of this serum was very positive-very little to no scent and it was a nice clear product without any stickiness. I have a couple of dark spots on my face that I have been hoping would lighten. I used the serum for the last couple of weeks, in the morning and before bed, as directed. It spread nicely on my skin, and dried quickly so I could finish with a moisturizer. While itu2019s only been a short time, I havenu2019t seen much change. I have experienced some terrible zits, however, and the eczema on my hands has gotten horrible. I stopped using my hands to apply the serum to my face and instead used a q-tip, and that helped my hands, but the zits continued. Unfortunately, I will have to give this product a pass."

Upon application, the serumu2019s lightweight texture absorbs effortlessly into the skin, leaving behind a refreshing sensation. Over time, I noticed a significant improvement in my skinu2019s overall radiance and clarity.  Not only did it visibly reduce the appearance of dark spots and hyperpigmentation, but it also helped to even out my skin tone, giving me a more luminous complexion.  Furthermore, I appreciated the addition of enzymes, which gently exfoliate the skin, promoting cell turnover and revealing a smoother, more refined texture. Despite having sensitive skin, I experienced no irritation or discomfort while using this product.  In terms of packaging, the serumu2019s dropper dispenser makes it easy to control the amount used, minimizing wastage.  In conclusion, this serum exceeded my expectations, delivering noticeable results in a relatively short period. Whether youu2019re looking to combat dullness, uneven skin tone, or simply want to achieve a radiant glow, this serum is a worthy addition to any skincare routine. Highly recommended for anyone seeking a brighter, more luminous complexion.  I received this product for free in exchange for a review."
