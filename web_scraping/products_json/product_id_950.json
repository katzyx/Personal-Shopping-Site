I wore that as eyeshadow for years and years. It was a gorgeous neutral with a lil shimmer perfect for everyday. I couldnu2019t match the color online so went into the store. The woman helped me (not many options to choose from) and bought this laura mercier one instead. (I wouldu2019ve matched it with the new Sephora eyeliners but very few colors to choose from and mostly weird bright colors.) So the Color was the closest match, even though a lil darker but tried it anyway. First time I use it and the whole stick falls out. Mind you itu2019s $33u20133x the price as the sephora one! But the worst part is it DOESNu2019T last all day like it says. Iu2019ve tried it for 2 weeks now and everyday it runs into my liquid eyeliner (that never budged) and smears, never ever had that issue. Im desperate I want the old sephora colors back :("

I am always quite leery of shadow sticks, as I have not been too satisfied with them in the past, but the Cavoar Sticks habe changed that for me.   The formula is nice and creamy, it glides on smooth and easy without having to put too much pressure on the lid or having the pull the lid tight to apply nor do they get gooey or sticky.  It's pigment is beautiful and the shimmer also doesn't affect the quality of the formula or application. It can be used to line, highlight, accent, fill, blend with fingers or a brush. It can also be used on the go. It's a nice quick application.   These sticks can be used by novice and expert alike easily achieving a great look that doesn't smudge, crease or fade throughout the day even without use of a primer!   I habe already purchased 2 other shades from this line and I tell absolutely everyone about it! If you haven't tried the Laura Mercier Caivar Shadow Sticks, do it now, don't miss out on this amazing product!"

I'm not sure about creasing, as I have monolids, but it definitely adds some dimension and makes for a great, lighter less intense smokey eye.

My main impression of this product isn't anything actually about it, but when I wear it PEOPLE NOTICE IN THE BEST WAY. Come in to work with no sleep after being sick for a week, and multiple people commented on how even though the rest of me looked like death, my eyes looked so awake and vibrant. This is entirely due to the caviar stick. When you wear it people go out of their way to compliment it, pretty much every time I have worn it someone mentions how bright my eyes are and it is great.   As for application this product is ridiculously easy. One swipe is enough for all day coverage (I am very pale) It is quite buildable, but due to my paleness it mostly builds the copper sparkle then suddenly the base becomes quite brown. Basically it is sparkles until smoky eye. There is also a green element in the sparkles that really helped with my fair olive skin tone, wish more products included this since it isn't noticeable on the eye but really brightens up my whole tone.   As with any stick style eyeliner you will want to be a bit careful, I did get too excited and overopened it when trying for swatches and a bit of the tip broke off, but this was my fault and the broken bit did reconnect so it is still completely usable (unlike pretty much every other one I've broken, this one was actually entirely salvageable) The stick is a little thicker and the consistency is soft but strong so it can be deceiving, it works really well when overextended, but I would avoid that since it will break eventually.  As for longevity, this stuff lasts. Usually sparkles end up everywhere, and the base color evaporates, but not with the caviar stick. After application I immediately rubbed the heck out of it and only had a tiny amount of sparkle migration. You will need makeup remover to get it off.   It is everything I ever wanted in an eyeshadow and more. Highly recommend."

IRL itu2019s a bit warmer than thatu2014 I was hoping it would be more like cobblestone looks in the pictures, but Iu2019m still wearing it. My favorite part about it though, is the fact that it actually doesnu2019t crease on my oily eyelids, which is kind of insane! I typically layer it on top of a little bit of foundation or concealer, then blend it out with a finger, and then let it dry down for a few seconds and it lasts all day without creasingu2014 doesnu2019t even need to be set with eyeshadow! And like I said my skin is on the oily side for sure. I also saw that lots of other reviews said that the product fell out of the packaging and I have use mine at least 10 times and have had zero issues with that, for the record. Maybe itu2019s only certain colors? I would for sure recommend this to other people, and I do plan on repurchasing as well as probably purchasing a few additional colors. I donu2019t think Iu2019ve ever used another eyeshadow u2013 in stick form, powder form or any other form u2013 that didnu2019t eventually crease. I hope they never change the formula!"

You can even give yourself a cat eye that looks way more sophisticated than the original black liner.

It has the tiniest glitter to give a shimmer effect and itu2019s really beautiful. Most eyeshadow sticks Iu2019ve tried make it so difficult to apply the color to your eyelid and so I donu2019t use them because eyelids are such delicate parts of the face and I donu2019t like having to rub them hard to get color to apply. Not this eyeshadow stick! It applies like a cream and you only need to use a very light touch for application. It glides with ease!! Itu2019s really amazing. You can keep it as applied initially for a more bold look, or you can smudge it out for a lighter look or to give a smoky effect. This eyeshadow stick is so versatile. It can be used for every day looks or for special nights out. I would absolutely recommend this to everyone and already put another color on my wishlist."

It is only slightly shiny, and makes the eye skin appear healthy and not at all greasy. It applies smoothly and evenly, and spreads nicely across my eyelids. This creamy eyeshadow feels so silky smooth, it feels as if it is very moisturizing, almost like applying skin care. The finish of the eyeshadow is light and natural, making the eyes look enhanced and defined, but not overdone. This shade could be worn day or night. I usually wear the eyeshadow with just a coat of mascara, but I have also worn it with heavy eyeliner for a bolder look, and it worked great!"

I usually use eye shadow palettes with a brush but this stick has become my go-to when I need a u201cno makeup makeupu201d look u2014 I can quickly add some color and sparkle to my lids and finish with mascara.

I donu2019t want to know what people who are making money off the products say, I want to hear from real people. So from one real person to another, I can honestly say this eyeshadow is amazing. I am obsessed with anything rose gold, but have never looked good in rose gold eyeshadow. It has always blended in with the color of my skin to the point where you canu2019t tell Iu2019m wearing eyeshadow at all. Laura Mercier has done a phenomenal job with the pigmentation of their caviar stick eyeshadows. Not only can you see that I am wearing eyeshadow, itu2019s sparkles and catches the light beautifully. I have always avoided stick eyeshadows because they have always been so dry and difficult to apply. That is not the case with this one. It glides on so easily and feels amazing on my skin. Itu2019s also buildable and can be blended easily which I love. But my absolute favorite thing about this eyeshadow is that it lasts all day. I donu2019t have to worry about touchups, donu2019t have to worry about bringing my eyeshadow with me if Iu2019m going to be out from morning until late night, and donu2019t have to take up extra room in my purse.

It does not lay down in clumps, like the now fashionable wet balms, it does not lay down thickly, so you can vary the shade - both for daytime makeup and a denser application for evening makeup. It makes the eye deep, big. You can slightly darken the corner with it, it will not look bright, for a gentle effect of makeup without makeup this is what you need. Silky application, without clumps, in an even layer. The ideal color for me, which can be applied to the folds of the eyelids and along the lash line, used as a base and eyeliner, creating a variety of images. Now for daytime makeup I apply in the center and this is my favorite for a week, although I already have 5 shades of this brand. I never have enough time for morning makeup, so these sticks are my salvation, simplicity and speed of application. I would not have paid attention to this color myself, but thanks to the company BzzAgent, who sent this product, I have a new and favorite product. As a basic, very easy to use shadows - this is great!"

You can just slip a few different colors in your purse and youu2019re set to go from daytime to nighttime for your looks. I do wish that the Modern Rose color had more, I guess, iridescence/shine/glittery-ness to it without impacting the formula.

I was a little hesitant to use a cream eyeshadow because of  bad experiences with creasing/wiping off during the day, but this one doesn't at all.  I use a primer first and then layer on the eyeshadow.  It is easy to apply, as it glides right across the eyelid.  The shade is wonderful and I love the bit of pearl shine in it! I would like to buy more so I can use the layer recommendations on the site! I received this product for free in exchange for writing the review."

It does give me some playtime once I apply it on my eyelid to blend it out before it sets. I can apply this very quickly directly to my lid, then with just the warmth of my ring finger blend it out for a one-and-done look. However, itu2019s my preference to use a stiffer eyeshadow brush to blend the edges out as it gives me a more polished final look. I love the creamy consistency and the fact that they last all day long. I was given the modern rose color, which is a beautiful shimmery shade that looks wonderful on your eyelids. I have found that putting a darker contour shade on my crease first and blending that out before applying the caviar stick to my lids has yielded an easy and beautiful look. I will definitely be purchasing more of these in both the shimmer and matte shades offered!"

The shade Modern Rose is no exception and has a rosegold shimmer with a dusty pink base and is a great multitasker on the eye. I use it as a base, liner, and highlight. The only downfall is the shimmer can make crepiness look worse if it is over-applied. It doesn't have any fragrance and never irritates eyes. It is long-lasting even in the heat of a subtropical summer, no smearing or running. Stays in place until I'm ready to remove it! I was gifted Modern Rose by Laura Mercier in exchange for my unbiased opinion."

It gives creamy finish and good for everyday use as it lasts longer than usual eyeshadows. It does not run into the eyes as its in stick form. The main advantage of this is, It does lasts the whole day. With this stick eyeshadow, I never feel that I am wearing it compare to the usual eyeshadow which occasionally comes into the eyes with a blink. I used this product with eye liner."

I have slightly hooded eyes that cause any shimmery powder shadow I apply on my lid to transfer to my crease. Because of this, I've begun using cream and liquid shadows to avoid that transfer.

For a metallic color it shows up quite nicely on the skin and the texture blends out easily enough that even a beginner could use this for eye looks. I like that its in a crayon form because it makes the eyeshadow process that much easier to do. Blending with a brush or your finger can make the look more muted or you can blend it less so to have a stronger rose gold look. I can see myself wearing it on a night on the town with friends or a date. Super pretty pigmentation overall."

Eyeshadow sticks / crayons became all the rage within the past few years and i have tried many on the market! Others may dry out easily, not blend, the color range is unimpressive or the ease of application was no more than a mere let down. I gave up.

I got the Modern Rose Caviar eye stick and WOOHOO, this baby not only applied but blended and wore like a dream! Itu2019s great for when your in a rush and it easily brightens and wakens your eyes with a nude color and shimmer. Now i feel compelled to try other shades. The price is on the high side, as are most prestige brands of cosmetics, however it is important to note that price does not indicate quality.  - [ ] rest assured, quality is never sacraficed with Laura Mercier cosmetics. I would recommend these to anyone looking for eyeshadow sticks but i would forwarn the price. There are some cheaper options available, because keep in mind, this shadow stick does not have the shelf life of powdered eyeshadow (2-3 years) , it may need to be replaced more often, like every 6-9 months . be wary of where theyu2019re kept in the summer heat. this would not be an ideal item to leave inside your car  or where it could melt."

I have oily lids and I live in Texas, so when I thought about a stick eyeshadow I didn't think it would be the best fit for me. The way I usually make my eyeshadow last is to add a thick layer of translucent setting powder before I apply eye make up and I new I wouldn't be able to do that with an eyeshadow stick. If you add the hot summer we are having in texas in my mind this was a recipe for disaster. I also have mature skin so I was worried about the eyeshadow creasing, and or sitting weirdly in the fine lines. I was so pleasently surprised. The first time I wore it, I went for a more minimal make up look, and I used the caviar stick all over my lid. I did not use any setting powder, or anything else for that matter on my lid. I was mostly indoors and the eyeshadow lasted all the 8hrs I needed it to and it was actually still going strong when it was time to take my make up off. Since then I had wore it a couple different ways, I have even bought other shades of the product and I love it. It doesn't crease or sit on my fine lines, it lasts a long time, it has a soft powdery finish, and the diferent shades betwen mattes and shimery give dimention to my different eye looks. The only thing I need to be carefull of is the application. If I want to add a little more detailed line I switch to a brush instead of using the stick directly. Overall I would definitely recomend it to my friends and family."

BUT NOT this one.  It impressed me at the way with one glide on each eye lid it seemed to have cover it all and leave a beautiful creamy shimmer finish. Also it doesn't not crease or smudge or transfer on anything! Also it's sweat and waterproof. I loved the creamy rich color of it and how it didn't look caked on or feel heavy just one swipe and I was flawless. It's so easy to apply.

It didn't need any additional blending with a finger or a brush, I was able to achieve the look I wanted straight from the tube. The color payoff was good and it was easy to build up. When it came time to wash my face, it came off easily with my oil-based make-up remover. Other brands have left some of the shimmer behind even after double cleansing but this did not. Stayed on like a dream but came off easily when it was time. I would definitely re-purchase this and recommend it to friends."

Therefor, eyeshadow doesn't usually make it into my daily routine.   That said, when the special occasion does come (or when I just want a little something extra), this eyeshadow stick will 100% be my go-to!  First, it's so easy to apply.  I rub the stick on the lower portion of my lids & use my fingers to blend a little higher on the lid & lower brow.  Second, it's a gorgeous neutral color.  I'm fair skinned & it works so well with my complexion.   It very subtle and just that little something to enhance without screaming that I'm wearing makeup.   If you've never used an eyeshadow stick and want something that will work for everyday, this is definitely the way to go!  I know the stick will last me a while, but definitely see myself buying this again when the time comes to replace."

I havenu2019t tested if it really lasts 24 hours but it definitely lasted the 8 that I wore it without creasing or smearing. The color is very pretty, though when I saw the name Amethyst I thought it would be a bit more purple. On me it looks mauve-bronze.

When my caviar stick ran out, I thought I could replace it with other creamy shadows I had on hand. And TBH, nothing I've used since compares. Sure, it's a bit pricier, but there's something about the way it glides on so easily and looks like I layered on different eyeshadow colors, that it's totally worth the cost.

This eyeshadow blends seamlessly with other shades and products. Whether youu2019re layering it with powder eyeshadows or using it on its own, it creates a smooth, even finish. The Caviar Stick Eye Shadow boasts impressive staying power. It lasted through an entire workday without creasing or fading, even without a primer.  This product is incredibly versatile. It can be used for a subtle daytime look or layered for a more dramatic evening appearance. Additionally, it works well as an eyeliner or base for other eyeshadows.  Overall, the Modern Rose Caviar Stick Eye Shadow is a fantastic addition to any makeup collection. Its ease of use, long-lasting formula, and beautiful color make it a standout product.

It literally took my 15 seconds to apply on my lids and smudged with my finger and viola!!! I am very fair so this was a bit much as a highlighter but I am sure if I was able to choose a lighter shade it would work great.

Plus, it stays put all day, even through my long work hours and after hour drinks  I will say, it took a bit of practice to get the blending just right - it is a little price but but given how often I use it and how long it lasts, I'd say it's worth the splurge. I'd definitely recommend giving this a try."

The formula is incredibly creamy and glides smoothly across the eyelid, allowing for easy application and blending.   One of the standout features of this product is its impressive staying power. Once it sets, it doesn't budge, ensuring your eye makeup looks fresh and vibrant all day long. Which was a key win for me with this product.

I would suggest using a good eye primer if you have very oily eyelids but these are the perfect eyeshadow products for people on the go!   I had the opportunity to try three different shades and theyu2019re all so pretty. The lighter shades are perfect for the high points of the face as highlight and the bronzy one for all over the lid or to deepen just the outer corner of the eyes.

I apply it right from the applicator..it glides on smoothly like silk and I can keep adding to get the depth of color I want. ITs totally buildable.  It has a beautiful finish that lasts all day until I take it off in the evening and it looks great all day without any creasing.  I cant believe how easy to use and effective it is.  The texture is creamy and the finish has a very slight shimmer, but not too much!...I feel like I've found the perfect and easiest to use eye shadow ever and I love it!"

            "review_text": "I received this product for free from Laura Mercier in the shade Amethyst, in exchange for my honest review. The shade is a beautiful dusty, purple-toned, metallic shimmer. The shade is very pigmented, but wasnu2019t the most flattering for my skin tone. However, I would purchase this product in a different shade. This product is very easy to apply and very comfortable on the lids. It is really lightweight and doesnu2019t even feel like I have anything on my eyes when I wear it. It is very creamy and rich, and rolls on the eyelid very smoothly. In the past, I have tried other eyeshadow sticks that required more pressure to be applied to roll the product on and almost felt like I was dragging it across my eyelid (which doesnu2019t feel great for the eye area), so I was pleasantly surprised at how light-handed you can be with this product. You really donu2019t have to apply much pressure at all, and it doesnu2019t feel tight or dry on the lid like others I have tried. Because of how creamy it is, I feel like it would definitely need to be paired with a good primer to get it to last for 24 hours and be transfer proof for someone with eyelids on the oily side like me. It would definitely be great in the winter or on skin that is more dry. I didnu2019t use primer and wore this product in the heat for about 8-10 hours. It didnu2019t crease, smear, or run, which is sooo important to me as a contact lens wearer (iykyk), but by the end of the night I noticed it had faded a bit. It doesnu2019t seem to budge on the eye, but it does rub off pretty easily if you rub your hand against it. I applied some to the back of my hand and let water run on it to test if it was waterproof, and Iu2019m happy to say the swatch remained perfectly intact!"

I also like to use them as an eyeshadow topper or for an extra pop of sparkle in my inner eye. The color isn't super pigmented so it works great for lighter when used alone. I got sent the shade Strapless to test out and it holds up just as well as my other colors. 10/10, love these."

This works perfectly for that. I did about four swipes over my eye lid and then used a brush to blend the edges. It was a quick look that added just a little something to my eyes. This color is more of a taupe sort of purple. It does have shimmer in it. It's a very subdued color. Don't grab amethyst thinking it will be super purple. It is a great everyday color though, a very neutral sort of purple. The formula is very nice. Super creamy and easy to glide on the lid. It did hold up well with no creasing. I would say this is a pretty great product if you want a super simple, quick eye look."

First of all, I'm not usually big into shimmery products, but the shimmer in this eyeshadow stick is both subtle and glam. It glistens really prettily and doesn't look or feel chunky. The stick glides on smoothly but doesn't melt or move around after it has set.   I was prepared for the color to be a lot less saturated and more sheer that it looks but it goes on with medium opacity, so you do get some decent color payoff. It is a little sheer, more sheer than an eyeliner stick, and it can be built up a bit and blended out with a small brush. I enjoyed applying it on the top of my inner corner and along the center of my lid for a bit of glam, and applied some liquid eyeliner along my upper lash line.   Good also if you want a subtle eyeliner-like look on the bottom without raccoon eyes- apply to the bottom outer lash line like an eyeliner pencil and set with a bit of neutral eyeshadow. You get a nice, subtle eye makeup look. Love a product like this that can be used for multiple looks."

The Caviar stick is an absolute dream to blend, and it's very creamy. It's also super gentle on my sensitive skin, and doesn't cause my eyes to burn like some liner products tend to. I wish that it lived up to the 24 hour wear that it quotes, since it melts off my oily lids even with primer midway through the day. The color is beautiful, but it's more subtle than I was expecting for an amethyst shade. I'd say it's more of a bronze shade? It photographs as taupe. Layering only adds more shimmer, and doesn't necessarily increase the color. I do own another caviar shade stick in the shade moonstone that I use regularly as a highlight on my browbone."

When I told my mother-in-law that I was getting this, she told me that she personally preferred the Bobbi Brown version, which I also used as my go-to shadow sticks for an easy put-together look when I donu2019t have the time or energy to use a palette.   I was totally expecting to be underwhelmed by the Caviar Stick, and I also saw it as heavily advertised and possibly overhyped. Boy, was I wrong!  The moment I started trying my new Caviar Stick in Rose Gold, I was sold.  Like my mother-in-law, I have hooded eyes that make applying eyeshadow difficult. But unlike her, I have super oily skin that makeup smudges on easily, and that extends even to my eyelids. I also have crinkly lids, Iu2019m not sure if itu2019s an age thing, related to the shape of my eyes, or related to my numerous surgeries that aimed to correct congenital glaucoma, but I was honestly amazed that, even without primer or any other product on my lids, it applied effortlessly. I was able to u201ccolor inside the linesu201d on my first try. I didnu2019t get a smudgy or jagged crease like I get with the Bobbi Brown shadow sticks that result in me having to correct them with a Q-tip or makeup remover pad after the fact. It just glides on seamlessly - literally. What amazed me even more was how easily I was able to apply it to my right eye, as Iu2019m completely blind in that eye. The picture I attached reflects the fact that I had to go over it a few times to make sure I didnu2019t miss a spot on my right lid (as a precaution), but on my left lid, I got it in one try. Iu2019m pretty dumbfounded.   Whatu2019s also great is that itu2019s super pigmented, and not chalky, streaky, or sheer. I canu2019t say the same about the first coat of any other shadow stick I ever used.  So yes, as much as I hate to buy into hype, this is totally worth it. The color is super subtle and pretty too, and it goes on effortlessly for an effortless look."

I don't usually gravitate towards shimmery colors, but Modern Rose was easy to use without looking messy. While it was fairly easy to blend and layer on top of my base shadow, I noticed some creasing at the end of the day, so I'd recommend not applying too much to avoid this problem."

The stick makes it so easy to apply, and despite its smooth texture, it has a non-greasy finish that looks more like regular shadow than most other eyeshadow sticks I have tried. The Modern Rose shade was very flattering.  Thanks, Laura Mercier! I received this product for free in exchange for my honest review."
