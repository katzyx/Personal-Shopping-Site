I have really dry and sensitive skin and I have not experienced any irritation or redness from using it. I like that it has a high SPF of 50. I need good protection from the sun's harmful rays, and I don't want to go below SPF 50. Since I wear makeup every day, I find this very helpful because it does not interrupt my makeup and skincare routine It leaves a very subtle glow on my skin and my makeup always goes on flawlessly! Ultraviolette is made in Australia with the best ingredients and sold worldwide! The packaging is cute too; the bottle is quite small and easy to carry in a handbag."

My skin feels incredibly hydrated, and it feels comfortable on the skin even after reapplying. I apply this skinscreen after moisturizing my face and I love that it has an invisible finish and it is not noticeable at all on the skin.   I feel confident and reassured using this product because it is Australian made and tested. Knowing how harsh the Australian sun can be, I trust it to provide protection in Canada.   I see myself definitely repurchasing this product! Love that Ultra Violette is now available in Canada!"

Review: Lightweight yet Effective: The first thing that struck me was the texture - it's incredibly lightweight and non-greasy. You barely notice you're wearing sunscreen! The formula is also surprisingly thin, making it a breeze to apply evenly across your face and body. The ultralight consistency allows for seamless absorption into the skin, leaving no residue behind. SPF50+ Protection: Now, about the all-important SPF aspect - I'm happy to report that this sunscreen delivers on its promise! With an impressive SPF50+ rating, you can trust it will provide reliable protection against UVA and UVB rays. The Fave Fluid Ultralight Screen is perfect for daily use, whether you're lounging by the pool, hiking in the mountains, or simply running errands. Highly recommend."

I like to put spf on the skin around my eyes if I can, because doesn't that skin deserve protection too? Most sunscreens I can't do it though because they'll make my eyes water, even some mineral ones. Not this one though - I can put it around my eyes (carefully) and don't notice it for the rest of the day! As for the rest of my face, it is causing no irritation or breakouts whatsoever, and my skin feels very soft. It does come out of the bottle pretty watery, but once I figured out how to apply it without making a complete mess, it's perfect. At first it applies very shiny and sticky, but once it dries it is more natural looking and feels like you don't have anything on. Also love that it has 75 ml which is more than most that have 50 ml. This is definitely going to be a staple sunscreen for me going forward, definitely recommend trying it if you have sensitive skin/eyes and if you don't like feeling your sunscreen on your face."

The texture is notably smooth and non-greasy, making it perfect for wearing under makeup without any pilling or residue. It provides broad-spectrum SPF50 protection, which is essential for shielding against both UVA and UVB rays. What sets it apart is its blend of antioxidants, including vitamin E, which helps to fend off environmental aggressors and maintain skin health.  I particularly appreciate the absence of fragrance and essential oils, which can be irritating to sensitive skin. Instead, this sunscreen feels gentle and soothing upon application. It doesn't clog pores or cause breakouts, making it suitable for those with acne-prone skin like mine.  In terms of wear, it holds up well throughout the day, maintaining its protective barrier without the need for frequent reapplication. The packaging is practical and travel-friendly, featuring a sleek pump dispenser that dispenses just the right amount of product."

Theyu2019re a suncare brand out of Australia, which is also where their products are made and tested. I always like using products that come from places with rigorous standards and it makes total sense to be using suncare from Australia. The applicator is a fine tip dispenser, which is great since the consistency of this is very thin and runny, so you really want a way to control the flow. I apply this in the mornings, after my moisturizer but before my makeup. Since this dries down to an almost powdery-light finish, itu2019s very easy to apply my concealer and foundation over top. As opposed to a silicone-based u2018invisibleu2019 sunscreen, you truly donu2019t even feel this on your skin, itu2019s that lightweight. It also contains niacinamide, so it works to treat your skin while also providing broad spectrum SPF protection. The scent is barely detectable and only when it first comes out of the bottle, dissipating quickly. Honestly if I didnu2019t know that I had applied this, I wouldnu2019t know that I was wearing sunscreen. It also doesnu2019t leave my skin looking dried out like some other facial sunscreens I've tried u2013 it actually seems to add moisture and make my skin look more alive and moist to the touch. Now that Iu2019ve discovered this, I canu2019t see myself going back to anything else u2013 it's made it so easy and uncomplicated to incorporate SPF protection into my daily routine."

Since I have medium-brown skin, it's always super difficult to find a sunscreen that doesn't leave a white cast AND one that works for my combo skin! I was super excited to try this out and use it in my daily skincare routine.   This sunscreen is extremely ultralight, weightless, and in a fluid texture. It's very liquidity, which allows it to blend into the skin. It feels like you have nothing on! It's invisible and doesn't leave me greasy or sticky.  I used this daily for several days and found that it doesn't break me too!   Not only does this sunscreen provide SPF protection, but it is made with next-gen UV filters and an impressive combination of skin-loving ingredients like Pentavitin, Niacinamide and Vitamin C! I love how you get multiple skincare benefits while using this product.   A huge plus is that it is also free of parabens, phthalates, oxybenzone, artificial fragrances, sulfates, SLS, and SLES. It is also cruelty-free!   This sunscreen is proudly made in Australia, which is literally known for their harsh sun environment. So, I know for a fact that this sunscreen was made considering extreme measures. Once I run out, I'll definitely be repurchasing!"

This product is so light and easy to apply - I have not noticed any pilling, and it hasn't irritated my skin or caused any breakouts. I had a hard time deciding which Ultra Violette formulation to go with, and I'm glad I chose this one!"

The filters that they use (like Tinosorb S and M) feel way better on my skin than the North American ones, and it honestly just feels like skincare. Fav Fluid is my go to from their skinscree lineup,  as it's lightweight and leaves my skin looking just that little bit dewy. It doesn't sting my eyes, and feels comfortable enough to wear all day under makeup."

I know the formulation changed a little when they started selling at Sephora Canada and since I still have the Australian version I wanted to see how they compare and they are nearly identical. The Canadian version might have a slightly less dewy finish which I actually prefer, but in general it's just an A+ lightweight sunscreen that works well under my makeup. It's a very thin, milky formula so getting the right amount for your face might be a little tricky but that's the only trouble I have with it."

It's very liquidy and doesn't leave a thick, greasy residue leftover after blending in. It leaves your skin looking hydrated and dewy, but not greasy. It is a bit shiny for my oily skin but I just use a bit of powder to tone down the shine and it's perfect for day to day wear. It works well with makeup too! I find if I use too many products before applying this then it can have some pilling issues, but if you keep it simple (I only use toner and vitamin C before this) then there are no issues with pilling at all. Makeup applies nicely on top of this and it never irritates my sensitive skin :) Absolutely love this sunscreen and highly recommend to everyone for a daily wear SPF"
