I cant speak from thinning hair, but my hair strains are fine and is virgin blonde hair.  In comparison to the famous coconut oil from OGX or really coconut oil in general has never worked for my hair it just never agreed with it so I was tired of the hype and wanted to find something that would suit my hair. That is when I discovered Fable & Mane and my hair loves this!!! It helps my dry scalp so much. The smell is Devine it's not super intense in my opinion and rinsing it out is easy there is no greasy residue like coconut oil would do to my hair. I use this once a week before I shower ( I prefer not to sleep with oil in my hair). This in my honest and humble opinion is #1 for me and I just bought the full size!! Full transparency I don't expect this to be a magical bottle of oil to what a lot of people look for in an oil to fix hair concerns.  If you have thinning hair it is suggested to see a dermatologist.

After a month and a half of consistent use I lose 40-50% less hair then I used to before. My scalp feels great and clean. I also used to experience dry itchy scalp which has completely gone away with using this oil before I wash my hair. I use the oil once a week. Make sure you use a clarifying shampoo after to completely clean your scalp. if you're still greasy then YOU'RE USING TOO MUCH. I have long thin type hair. I leave it on my scalp for about 30 mins to an hour I don't sleep with it on. I recommend this scalp oil 100% Just use it properly for your hair type. And yes there is a strong scent, but bonus to me is I love it. if you don't like a strong scent maybe skip it."

The oil has a pleasant texture and isn't too heavy, which is perfect for my fine hair. Plus, it offers great value for the price, so I feel itu2019s worth it for the gentle nourishment it provides.

When applying the oil to my hair, my scalp started to feel less itchy and gave it a calm effect no longer irritated. I noticed when I was messaging my fingers with the hair oil, my scalps were coming off. I only left it on for 10 minutes and washed it off, because I thought the fragrance would hurt my scalp but did the opposite. I like the idea you can keep the oil in your hair at nighttime and go to sleep to help nourish my roots and the rest of my hair. I made sure to only use two drops because I saw it can leave my hair oily."

I just parted by hair in a few sections and then rubbed it in with my fingers. At the end I also combed my hair to spread it more evenly.   After an hour I rinsed it with water in the shower. Then I washed my hair with shampoo.   To my surprise my hair didnu2019t end up looking greasy after it was dried. I had the feeling that my scalp really liked this treatment. I didnu2019t have the amount of flakes I usually get. Also my hair seemed to have more volume at the roots. The scent was pleasant. Kind of between floral and herbal.   I will be using this hair oil until it is gone. Possibly also getting more after that."

Recently, I have felt like my hair has been looking dull and lifeless.   I order to counteract this, I have gotten really into hair care, and oiling my hair pre-wash has been a big part of that.  I normally just use a rosemary oil, but the Fable Mane HoliRoots Pre-Wash Hair oil sounded really interesting to me.   This oil contains Ashwagandha and Dashmool, which are supposed to strengthen and restore your hair.    The instructions say to apply one dropper to your roots and hair and to massage it.  I have read that massaging it in is the key to healthy hair.  I then leave it in for at least 5 minutes, but I have left it in for a few hours.  After I wash my hair, my hair feels super softer and is much more shiny.  I have even been asked what I am doing differently with my hair, since it looks so nice.  I am not sure if my hair seems stronger, but I am sure I need to continue using this product to see the long-term benefits.  However, I am definitely pleased with the short-term benefits and will continue to use this product."

Infused with the goodness of Ashwagandha, this treatment oil has made a noticeable difference in the health and thickness of my hair. Ashwagandha is known for its rejuvenating properties, and I can attest to its effectiveness. Since using this treatment oil, I've noticed a  reduction in hair fall, less build up, and my hair feels stronger and more resilient.  I apply this treatment oil generously to my scalp and hair before washing, allowing it to penetrate and nourish my strands. The oil is lightweight and doesn't weigh down my hair. After washing, my hair feels incredibly soft, and I've even noticed  some new growth in areas where my hair was thinning, hello baby hairs!!!  The soothing aroma of this treatment oil is also a plus. It has a calming, earthy scent that helps me relax during my hair care routine. It helps give the full self-care experience."

I have thinning fine bleached hair which has oily roots so I am always concerned that any product applied to my hair in the scalp and root area will be too much. I parted my dry hair before bed and applied about a half a dime size amount to my part and then gently moved it around and massaged my scalp. My hair did not break nearly as much after using this for a week and I thought that I could see new growth at previously thinning spots.

I won't know how well it works unless I use it for a couple of months but I do know my scalp hurts less after one use and my hair is soft (even though I only used it on my roots). It also has a nice scent that smells like perfume."

First, this is pretty strongly fragranced so FYI for those sensitive. Itu2019s a floriental scent so not my particular cup of tea but definitely not unpleasant. It wasnu2019t noticeable after I was done in the shower. I only use two or three drops and massage my scalp, lengths and ends and use that as a sort of relaxing me-time.

This oil is inspired by an ancient Indian hair secret and it's made with ingredients like Dashmool, ashwagandha, and castor oil. After using it for a couple of weeks, I noticed some incredible results. My hair started growing like crazy, my scalp felt super nourished, and I had way less breakage when brushing. Plus, the scent is so lovely. It's a spicy floral-oriental fragrance that takes you on a little trip to the divine city of Madurai in India. To use it, I just part my dry hair, put some oil in my palms, and massage it into my scalp and roots. I leave it on for a few minutes or even overnight for the best results. Then, I rinse it out with lukewarm water and follow up with the HoliRoots Hydrating Shampoo. Overall, I'm really impressed with this pre-wash treatment oil. It's become a staple in my haircare routine and I highly recommend giving it a try. Your mane will thank you! ud83dude04ud83cudf38"

This product claims to nourish and strengthen your hair before you shampoo, and it definitely lives up to its promises. The first thing I noticed about this treatment is the amazing scent. It has a beautiful, natural fragrance that lingers in your hair long after you've rinsed it out. The scent alone is enough to make me want to use this product again and again. The consistency of the treatment is also great. It's not too thick or heavy, so it spreads easily through the hair without leaving any residue. I applied it to my damp hair and left it on for about 10 minutes before shampooing as directed. After rinsing out the treatment and shampooing my hair, I immediately noticed a difference in the texture. My hair felt incredibly soft and smooth, and it looked shiny and healthy. I also noticed that my hair was easier to detangle and style, which is a huge plus for someone like me who has thick and unruly hair. I've been using this pre-wash treatment for a few weeks now, and I can honestly say that my hair has never looked better. It feels stronger, looks shinier, and is overall much healthier. I also love that this product is made with natural and organic ingredients, so I feel good about using it regularly. I highly recommend the Fable and Mane pre-wash hair treatment. It's a luxurious and effective product that delivers on its promises. If you're looking to improve the health and appearance of your hair, give this treatment a try. You won't be disappointed."

I have way less hairfall than I normally do (noticing less hair falling in the shower, on my brush and on my bathroom floor after styling my hair!). I put it in 1-2 hours before I wash my hair, and put about 2 full droppers onto my scalp. I took one star off because I find it doesn't help my dandruff/dry scalp very much like other people mentioned in their reviews. I have to use other products to help with that, but for my hair growth and strength I am a huge fan! Works better than the the coconut oil/castor oil mixture I used to use before. I am almost finished my mini size and have already purchased the full size!"

My hair is quite healthy and resilient so I generally ignore those reviews as I've never had that happen to me with any hair product. I used it exactly as directed  on the bottle and I was so alarmed at the amount of hair I lost from this product when washing my hair. Hair fall while shampooing & conditioning is normal for me especially as I detangle, but I was alarmed that it looked like I was taking extensions out of my hair in the shower. My hair was coming out in chunks. The instructions advise to leave it on overnight, which is what I did but after all that hair fall I decided to give it another chance by leaving it on for a lesser amount of time. I unfortunately still had the same results with my hair falling out. My hair did feel pretty soft once it was dry but the amount of hair I lost is not worth that at all. I gave it 3 tries to give it a fair chance but ended up returning this."

After blowout, hair is just the same as it is without this oil. Glad I only bought small size. Also no hair oil will make your hair fall out, most ridiculous thing I ever heard of. Maybe an allergic reaction will cause scalp itching, but not hair loss. So one star for mild scent, one for not leaving my scalp greasy and one star for not staining my pillowcase,  Will not be purchasing again."

During the VIB sale I decided to go all in and get the value size 3.4 oz. So far Iu2019ve used it twice in two different ways. First was 3-4 full droppers of product massaged on my entire scalp then combed thoroughly, left it on for about 1 hour and then showered. My hair felt so insanely soft for over a week with daily shampooing and conditioning. Second time I used it was as an overnight treatment and only one dropper massaged through my scalp and combed thoroughly, top loose bun and showered in the morning. It left my hair soft and not as luxe as the first time, I probably just needed more product.   Whatever is in this, it makes my hair so lovely and soft. Iu2019ve used so many oils and they work beautifully but none work like this. This oil is a stand out product for my particular hair and scalp health.   Not sure how this will go long term, but so far I love how my brushes glide through my hair, my hair feels smoother, hydrated and not greasy. I will for sure repurchase this product.   My only critique is that they should omit artificial or added fragrance from their ingredients. Sure non added fragrance that occurs naturally from the oil is totally fine but I donu2019t care for the added fragrance."

After having medical problems last year which really did a number on my normally thick, curly hair, I was looking for some major help in getting my hair back to a better place. I am *so glad* I found the Fable and Mane pre-wash oil!   Since I've been using it, I've noticed a huge difference in how much thicker and healthier my hair looks. Once a week, I leave it in for a few hours and then shower. It definitely takes a double wash to get it all out. It took me a few times of using it to realize I don't even need a full dropper for the right amount of coverage. It feels a bit oily at first after massaging it in, but then it absorbs in so you can't even tell that it's there. I've definitely gone out to run errands for a few hours with this oil in my hair. I'm still growing out the damaged parts of my hair but you can tell that the new growth is so much healthier, thicker, and softer. Even the old damaged hair on which I still haven't been able to fully grow out yet has not gotten any more split ends since I started using this product. It's pretty amazing. I'm a huge fan of this product and will continue to use it!!"

It is a clean and somewhat earthy scent, but not too woodsy/earthy at all. If you have used the JVN products before, it is nothing like strength of those products. I love vanillas/coconuts/ambers and this scent does not turn me off at all. I can't speak to the product because it's my first time trying the product!!

I think the biggest problem people have with the smell, dandruff etc is that they are using way way way too much.   I read an article with the founders of the company and it made the instructions make more sense to me.   You are only supposed to use a few drops! And then spread it on your fingertips and massage it into your scalp.   This product is VERY different from other hair oils. It's just for your scalp/roots and only before washing. The smell isnu2019t overpowering AT ALL when you donu2019t use too much.   I use this on myself, my husband and my daughters! It's amazing and all of our hair has gotten much softer, fuller, lighter, healthier, shinier since using.   (For reviews that talk about dandruff... dandruff is caused by excess oil, not dry skinu2026 so if youu2019re slathering tons of this on your scalp it definitely could cause it.

It has barely any scent, so I think what people might be smelling as bad is actually the rubber dropper. I got a sample and when I first opened it had a horrible rubber smell. But once I put it in my palm and made sure that it was upright so it wasnu2019t touching the rubber, the oil had a very faint herbal scent. But once I put it on my hair it completely loses its scent after an hour, which I appreciate because I want to control my scent through perfumes or whatever I choose to wear that day.

Why I haven't written a review on the thousands of products I have tried is beyond me, but I plan to start now because there is so much to share!  So, there is no transformative hair product out there.  Really, you need trial and error (and time) to see if something is working for you or not.  The number one issue I find with hair oil is that a lot of people who are using it may not actually need it (or their expectation is that they will wake up with Pantene ProV hair).    This pre-wash hair oil is for someone who has noted hair loss/shedding due to dry hair that is breaking easily, or someone who is experiencing more dry-itchy scalp and is potentially causing hair loss from all of the itching/scratching.    I live in very dry, cold conditions during the winter months.  Classically I start to notice more hair fall and breakage once November hits, and it'll progress through until late March or so.  I have wavy/curly hair and it is thin.  I find that using this oil once/week, along with a hydrating shampoo/conditioner, is leading to less hair loss and breakage.  My scalp is no longer itchy, and in-turn I am scratching far less.  How to use: I don't leave anything on overnight as I find it can clog up hair follicles and cause irritation/folliculitis.  I would advise putting this on after work on an evening when you have no commitments, and leaving it on for about 3-4 hours before washing.  Of course you can do this during the morning/day as well on a weekend.  Do not tie your hair up or braid it etc; the stress on the hair follicle along with the oil will make it more prone to fall-out.  I think if used right, and for the right purposes, this is one of my most favourite hair oils of all time."

I love my Indian hair ritual results but am not keen on the sticky and pungent smelling mixtures. Eventhough so many ingredients are staple Indian hair and skincare herbs, I can use this oil to keep it all in my hair routine without the assault to my senses! I usually leave oils in my hair overnight before washing the next day and it's a whole ordeal making sure your skin and bedding isn't smelling of oil. This oil almost vanishes after application, so it doesn't feel like you're over-applying it to your head.  I can see how my hair feels much lighter and fluffier after washing now - it has the same bouncy and thick feeling at the scalp I used to have when my hair was a very short bob. I never thought I would get that vitality back to my hair after growing it out for so many years now.  As a bonus, because I love how my hair looks and feels after washing again after being worried my hair feels limp and dry for so long despite my trusted Indian oil routines. I am now taking even better care of my hair between washes, and braver to try new hair wash products to elevate my hair wash experience as I am confident in how this oil nourishes my scalp and hair. As a side note: tested out both this Holi Roots pre-wash oil and the JVN hair oil sample sizes, and honestly with identical experiences and results, I am happy to keep them both as my only pre wash oils now to use on alternating washes, and won't be going back to the oil fashioned Indian oils!"

I was super skeptical in the beginning because Iu2019ve always had issues with my scalp and other pre-washes Iu2019ve used, while they worked initially, ended up not doing anything long term for me.   Iu2019ve been using this since the beginning of August and omg my scalp has never been/looked healthier?! I could tell after my day 2 hair that my scalp was hydrated and not dry and starting to flake. And I can actually go a full week now without having to wash my hair (I have super long, curly textured Asian hair).   I use it as an overnight treatment and put my hair up in a loose bun. I definitely recommend leaving it in longer than the minimum 5 minutes, I just feel it penetrates the scalp better if you do.   Iu2019m not sure why there are comments saying it didnu2019t help with hair growthu2026no where in the description does it claim to help with that. The main purpose is to help with dryness and damaged hair. Keep that in mind before purchasing this.  Oh. It smells great too, so thatu2019s definitely a plus."

I get buildup on my scalp (not from products, I think just natural oils) resulting in flakes.  The first use resulted in worse flakes, but I suspect that was because it was loosening everything up. I gave it another try and it was much better.  For me, the smell was MUCH too musky and strong, it almost immediately gave me a headache. Personally, this was the biggest problem with this product. But it worked well enough that I kept using it. Not sure about purchasing again however, due to the scent."

This is A cult-favorite pre-wash and root treatment oilu2014inspired by an ancient Indian hair secretu2014that contains strengthening ashwagandha for a healthier-looking, beautiful mane. It is very lightweight oil texture! It is a vegan and silicon- free to strengthen and deeply hydrate hair from the roots! I follow the instructions, apply a few drops on scalp massage into my hair roots! Leave on for at least five minutes before I wash my hair! Rinse well with lukewarm water before cleansing with Shampoo! I can feel it strengthens roots and strands, hydrates the scalp! Scalp felt more nourished! My hair felt healthier! More hydrated! So soft and silky after using this hair oil! I think this will be very great for winter time to use this hair oil because my hair gets dryer at that time! Looking forward to getting more healthier hair growth by continuously using this hair oil!"

The first two times I used it it gave my hair a nice shine. The third time my hair looked more healthy, less damaged. The last time I used it my itchy scalp was acting up so I was able to put a dropper full right on the spot. That really helped relieve the itch and that was two days ago. Each time I used a little bit more and now use 2 full droppers each time, twice a week before going to sleep. The scent is also very nice and acts like an aromatherapy to help me sleep. When I take a shower the next morning the light scent fills the shower and smells so nice. I didnu2019t expect much from this product but it has become such/ a nice treat for my hair/scalp and my well-being. Highly recommend it."

It flaked them off in a satisfying way.  I applied the oil during the day, allowed it to sit on my scalp and throughout my hair.  The next morning I went on a 2 hour long run, to allow the oil to really bake into my hair.  I could smell something funky all throughout the day, and then the next morning on my run.  I wouldnu2019t purchase this for that reason.  However, I am so thankful for the opportunity to test this product from Influenster and Fable & Mane"

Besides the fragrance, this product contains no silicones or chemicals. Most oils are leave-ins, which make hair heavy and/or greasy, making styling difficult. Since this Fable Mane oil is a pre-wash oil, it is suitable for all hair types, even fine hair. I applied the oil overnight to my long, color-treated hair using a processing cap to protect my pillow. After washing and conditioning my hair in the shower the following morning, I felt silky and smooth. I'll continue to use and recommend the oil."

Sometimes I mix it with a light-weight oil if I want to put it on my ends. My hair becomes noticeable curlier, softer, and silkier without becoming oily. Seriously, the curls I get from this are amazing. The next day my hair gets big (lots of volume and definition) and remains smooth and soft. It does have a fragrance which I personally like.

You have created a product that is very natural on one hand in terms of your other ingredients, but then you add synthetic fragrances that are so overpowering. Makes no sense. Please consider ALL customers when you make a product. Not everyone wants a heavily scented product. This overall is a great product in terms of its purpose but the strong fragrance really ruins it. I have had to stop using it regularly because it gives me headaches. PLEASE make this in an UNSCENTED version or at least REDUCE the strength of the fragrance."

I have noticed shine and despite what I've read from the reviews the smell does not bother me at all. I was expecting something patchouli-like or something super floral but it was a light clean scent that was not strong enough to give me a headache. I know everyone reacts to scent differently, but if you're worried it might deter you from purchasing, the smell is not horrible and you can wash it out within 5 minutes of having it in your scalp anyway.   Overall, I'm very pleased and would likely repurchase. I'd say it's still too early to tell for me to see if it helps with my scalp health/hair loss."

I have fine, thinning hair and am always looking for something to strengthen the hair and add volume and this product did both.   I was skeptical at first as having fine, thinning hair always means any oil or product that makes the hair look greasy or weighed down is never a good thing. However this product advertises as a scalp treatment to promote stronger, healthier hair so I decided to try it.   I emptied a full pipette into the scalp and ran the excess through my hair and left on for 15 minutes before shampooing out.   I am very happy with the results after just one use. Immediately out of the shower and towel drying my hair I noticed right away that my hair was already more voluminous. I could immediately tell in the front that my hair already had a lot more volume and body. I traditionally have to do a lot of u201cfluffingu201d to my hair in tandem with products to add volume and today I just let my hair air dry.   Itu2019s got a lot of body, volume, and feels incredibly smooth and healthy. Will definitely continue to incorporate this product into my routine."

I just use a hair oil on my ends and whatever residual I have I use for the rest of my hair. My hair is so soft, so shiny and so manageable after just 10 min of leaving this on.

Also fragrance is a top ingredient.. im hoping its just a natural fragrance like essential oil but it doesnt make that very clear in the description."

While some studies show that oils can help hair growth, don't expect any growth miracles from this (especially because a bottle doesn't last long). Make sure to do your research before believing marketing claims. It's more for a good smell and some self care plus scalp massage can help hair growth on its own. I think I prefer applying it to the hair rather than the scalp though."

Itu2019s meant as a pre-shampoo treatment for your scalp, you can leave it on a half an hour before shampooing up to a few hours. It contains several oils , one being castor oil, which is supposed to help with hair growth. Iu2019ve used it as a pre-wash and Iu2019ve used it after styling my hair and applying it to my ends, one for the lovely scent and second to smooth out frizz. It almost reminds me of the hot oil conditioning treatments that we did in the 80u2019s. It smoothed out my ends , which are frizzy and after shampooing my roots were nice and shiny and not oily looking, which I know some people are worried about. I received this product free through Influenster for my honest review."

I noticed my hair felt very hydrated and shiny after using it. I used this as a treatment by applying it and washing my hair either when I woke up or a few hours later after applying. As far as hair growth I donu2019t think I have used it enough to notice any growth. The scent of this oil is nice and pleasant. I started by using just a few drops on my fingers and applying to different areas on my head. I did find that at times some went on my pillow case but it washed off. I think this oil is priced reasonably. A tip I did was I used it on my beard and I did notice it helped with dryness and it did moisturize my beard and chin area. Would I recommend this productu2026.. if you like oils yes, although there are hair masks out there to provide moisture.

After applying, I wait about 5 minutes before I rinse the product out and proceed with my usual shower routine. My favorite part about the pre-wash treatment is the fragrance blend u2014 which has top notes of almond, middle notes of Indian jasmine, and base notes of patchouli and neroli.

I applied one dropper of the Pre-Wash Oil onto my roots and throughout my hair leaving it in until the next morning. It has a subtle earthy scent. In the morning I washed my hair and style as usual. I used HoliRoots Hair Oil twice a week for 4 weeks. I noticed my hair is softer, stronger,  and not as frizzy.  But my scalp was dry and itchy from leaving it overnight. I suggest using the product 5 minutes before shampooing. The Oil can be used on all hair types. The formula is Cruelty Free, Vegan, and Silicone Free.  @fableandmane @influesnter @reesetisha #FableandMane #HoliRoots #Influenster #Reesetishas2cents #reesetisha #holirootsreviews"

I bleach my hair every few weeks so my hair can feel overworked at times but using this along with my other serums really seemed to help my hair.

I canu2019t attest to its strengthening abilities, because, while my 2b/2c wavy hair is dry and frizzy, itu2019s thick, strong, grows fast, and Iu2019ve never had issues with breakage or split ends.   I canu2019t quite make out the fragrance, but itu2019s light and smells warm, vaguely like vanilla/chocolate/coffee but without the cloying sweetness. I donu2019t get spicy floral at all. As someone with a sensitive nose who doesnu2019t wear perfume and doesnu2019t like scented skincare & makeup, I found it unobtrusive and quite pleasant.   My only gripe is the dropper bottle. It drips so thereu2019s no way to control the drops so itu2019s a bit messy to apply. Also, the direction says to use at least one dropper of oil, but the dropper only draws about 1/4 full, so I canu2019t tell if that means a full dropper full (4x) or 1/4 dropper full."

I have long, thick coarse, Pacific Islander hair, this product helped to tame my hair when straightened, making it look smooth and shiny, and when curly, it helped make my curls not as frizzy. I usually do an overnight treatment and will saturate my hair in the oil, put it in a bun and put a shower cap over it overnight, with a towel on my pillow. When I wake up in the morning, it easily rinses out with shampoo, sometimes I use a deep conditioner on the ends, but usually the oil is enough of a condioner treatment.  It leaves my hair with a light scent, that is not overpowering. This also helps to moisturize my scalp since I use a lot of heating tools on my hair. I will be buying this and will continue to be a part of my weekly hair routine to help my hair look itu2019s best."

Rubbed it through and let it sit for 5 minutes as instructed.   It washed out quickly and easily. I noticed my curls were defined and pretty after using so it didnu2019t weigh my hair down.   I have color treated hair and had no issues.  I am going to be honest I didnu2019t read instructions so I used this completely wrong at first. I used it as a traditional hair oil and it worked.  I used it as hair oil too.   Over all pleased  I received this product complimentary in exchange for my honest opinion but the opinion expressed is all my own"

The product itself smells good and doesn't feel heavy. My hair is naturally oily and color-treated, so I was a bit wary of how it would interact, but it doesn't seem to be much of an issue. I don't know if I've seen much of a difference yet because I've only used it a few times, but my hair does feel a bit softer and stronger."

The product smells amazing as well!! I was never worried about my hair being too oily after washing it. In fact my hair was more hydrated when using this.This product worked amazing for my hair!! Definitely will be buying this again!!"

Thatu2019s how I plan to use the remainder of it up. However, I hated the way it felt when I applied it the other suggested way, from tip to roots & scalp. It didnu2019t help my scalp but of course made me itchy much sooner than usual after a wash. And it took 2-3 washes after that, shampooing twice each time to get it all out.

When activated, this product has a strong scent too, so itu2019s difficult to leave on for too long. I also found it took extra time to wash carefully enough to get out all of the oil. Ultimately, I think there are just far easier, less time consuming ways to achieve the same results, such as a leave in or after shower spray. Since you need to be regular with your use to see results, to apply the treatment, let it sit, and carefully wash it out feels like too much of a time suck."

The oil is presented in a glass bottle and paired with a dropper that allows you to control the amount of oil you want to use. The dropper itself does not fill completely; I'd say it fills about a third of the way. I have long hair, so I've been using 2-3 droppers per treatment. I like to apply the oil and let it work its magic for at least half an hour before washing my hair. The longer you leave it in, the better! You can even apply it and leave it overnight (as suggested by the brand) before washing it out, although I prefer to leave it on while I work on other stuff around the house. I've noticed this product has given my color treated locks some much needed TLC and nourishment. It's helped my hair not only feel softer, but also look healthier. Overall, a great product to add to your hair care routine. I highly recommend it!"

I've tried this twice now - once for 10 minutes, and this second time for about 3-4 hours. I did see better results with the longer time period, though I don't think I'd go longer, personally.  My hair feels STRONG after using this, I'm not sure how else to describe it. Fortified? The texture does make it harder to run my hands through it. That's my only complaint,  but it's a minor one. I will likely try more products from this brand, and I would definitely recommend this to friends."

Says donu2019t need strong roots, but I do have scalp drama. If I donu2019t medicated with shampoo, I get itchy, scales, nasty. So I was interested what this would do for my scalp. First, I put it heavily on my scalp overnight. When I woke up, I was expecting heavy, oily roots. To my surprise, my head drank it up! My scalp def wasnu2019t as dry as normal! I also used it as an all over treatment after going dark brown to copper red. Yu2019all, somehow, someway, my ends are NOT fried! What! Lastly, Iu2019ve used it as a leave-in on damp hair. It makes my hair shiny, but never looks greasy. Iu2019ve read reviews complaining the scent is strong, but that wasnu2019t my experience at all. The smell is light, but somehow a little nutty and spicy, as well. I really enjoy it, and never felt like it was competing with my perfume. I def recommend this if you want to feed your hair!! If you are looking for something that is going to be an instant hair perfect or, this is not that. It doesnu2019t have any silicones. But I do feel like it really nourished my hair!  Also for reference, I have long, curly hair. Tends to be dry. Protein sensitive."

The first time I slept in it overnight, I didnu2019t see any noticeable difference; however my second time I kept it in for 20-30 minutes, and I may have had one of the best 3a/b curly hair weeks Iu2019ve had lately. By this, I mean - my roots were SO soft and had no frizz. (I lightly refreshed with Curls Quenched Curls Leave In Moisture, to get some of my curls more bouncy mid-week). For me, frizz is the roots means I really need to completely refresh or wash - so that was a win. Thinking this may be a fluke, I used the oil again a week later and left it in for about an hour. I even changed my hair products to see if that was what influenced the results - but they were consistent.

I do wish the product were a bit more hydrating, but it has still done wonders for my hair. My hair is so dry and damaged that I would often wake up with a tangled mess before I started using the oil. The product feels so nice on the scalp. I think that the oil is well worth the price because a little goes a long way. I do use quite a bit when I use it, but my hair is very long and thick.

I would drip the oil onto my scalp/roots and then rub it in with my fingers. I slept in it and like the results I got. Before my roots were so dry that when I would get out of the shower they would still be dry like they didnu2019t even get wet and I had a lot of dandruff. After using this for a month I saw noticeable changes even after the first wash! My roots are now so much more hydrated and not dry after getting out of the shower. Iu2019ve also seen a huge decrease in dandruff. Iu2019m so excited to see what kind of long-term results this will bring with continued use. I highly recommend!"

I wasn't sure if it was something that would go away after it was dry, but it still smelled. Once dry, my hair did not feel or look any different than normal. Overall, the after-smell will 100% prevent me from using this product again. I received this item for free in exchange for my honest review and opinion"

Although the packaging is nice, the most important aspects (at least to me) are the ingredients and performance. Even though the ingredient list is long, it contains no water and aside from fragrance the only other ingredients are all oils and extracts - no silicones - and itu2019s vegan and cruelty free. As a cosmetologist, I definitely appreciate all of that. I also appreciate that there are not a lot of products like this on the market. Most oils are leave in, which can weigh hair down or make hair too soft and/or heavy to easily style. Most people with fine hair completely avoid oils altogether because of this, but since this Fable & Mane oil is a PRE-WASH oil, it truly is for all hair types. I applied the oil to my long, color treated hair and left it on overnight with a processing cap on to protect my pillow. After washing and conditioning my hair in the shower the following morning, my hair felt silky and smooth and combed out very easily. I also noticed I lost less hair while washing and brushing. I really liked this oil, and I will continue to use it and recommend it to others."

I wash my hair once a week or so, so made sure to use this on wash day and let it sit for 10 mins or so prior to washing it out. Afterward my roots felt noticeably cleaner, like buildup was reduced and the shine was through the roof! I loved this!  My only complaint is that the dropper only filled about 1/3 of the way no matter what I did and I have a LOT of thick hair so it took many droppers to apply.

And while I'm generally again most goop products, their pre shampoo hair oil made my hair super soft. This didn't do a thing. Not a bit of difference. Maybe even a bit more brittle than when I just use my usual shampoo and conditioner?

My hair is so soft, shinny, and less itchy. Did not feel greasy at all and I do get an oily scalp after one day so this seem to help with that.

I must admit, I was very skeptical and a little hesitant to use it at my roots like the instructions say as that had always been a complete disaster with every other hair oil Iu2019ve ever tried. Normally if I put oil above the bottom third of my hair it all ends up looking greasy and gross. But I went for it and was amazed with my results! My long hair Is already pretty shiny and healthy looking but this stuff really elevated that in a way that was so noticeable that I had friends and coworkers asking if I had changed my hair products and strangers were complimenting me on my hair a lot more often. It looked and felt super smooth, shiny, and healthy, and moisturized without looking oily. Iu2019ve been using it a couple times a week for three weeks now and have just fallen in love with this hair oil. So far Iu2019ve left it on for as little as 2 hours and as long as overnight and havenu2019t noticed a huge difference in the outcome. I do make sure that I rinse my hair really well prior to shampooing my hair and I always make sure that I am doing a thorough shampoo job. This is what I did the first time that I used this product since I was pretty worried my hair would be a mop of oil the next day. I donu2019t want to deviate from this process now that I am loving the results. Some reviewers mentioned a strong or unpleasant scent and I canu2019t agree with that. To me the scent is lovely and not overpowering. I canu2019t say that my hair has become thicker or has grown faster; it hasnu2019t been enough time and I already have very thick hair that grows fast so Iu2019m not sure I would notice anyway.  I definitely feel like the strands of my hair are a little stronger - I noticed I am not losing as much hair as before when washing or brushing my hair. But most importantly to me is the way my hair looks and feels after I use the Holiroots Hair Oil. It was exactly what I needed to up my hair game!"

As someone with oily hair I was super skeptical, but this didnu2019t leave any oily residue or make my hair more oily. I do believe using this long term may help with the oiliness of my scalp, rebalancing the scalp - kind of similar to using a moisturizer for oily skin to help rebalance the skinu2019s oil production. I wash my hair daily (I have oily hair/workout often).  I like using this 2-3x a week 5-10 minutes before I step into the shower, massaging it in well. I then wash it off with a pretty strong shampoo. My one gripe is the packaging. To get the oil into my roots I have to touch the dropper to my dirty hair and then I put the dropper back into the bottle. I do worry if this transfers bacteria into the formula. Also, I do tend to drip the oil onto my face so at least for me this isnu2019t a super mess-free process. As someone with acne-prone skin it hasnu2019t broken me out so I am glad about that!"

Iu2019ve been coloring and highlighting my hair for years and just started letting my natural grey grow in a couple of years ago. The ends still have color/highlights and tend to get a little dry and crispy.  On days Iu2019m going to wash my hair, Iu2019m applying the Fable & Maine HoliRoots to my scalp and roots, then I put my hair up in a clip for a couple of hours while I put together dinner and eat. Itu2019s been wonderful so far leaving my hair and scalp perfectly hydrated. It washes out great and doesnu2019t leave any kind of oily residue on my scalp and Iu2019ve not noticed my hair or scalp getting any oilier between shampoos. Thatu2019s great news.   I do use a leave-in oil on my ends most days to keep the flyaways at bay, but the Fable & Maine HoliRoots is not that kind of oil. Itu2019s meant to be washed out, not left in."

Having thick, curly hair can be tough, and this has made my hair feel soft and easy to manage. Normally I have lots of frizz, but because it addresses my hair's root health I can see a big difference. It does take more than 1 dropper(I think I use about 4 to 5) to really get through all of my hair evenly. If you have thick or long hair, be sure to separate into multiple sections to distribute well."

The first time I tried it I wasnu2019t quite sure just how much oil I should put in my scalp and hair. The honest answer is: however much your hair needs. My hair is thick, coarse, and semi-wavy. This meant that I when applying on my scalp and working to the ends, my hair really needed the extra OOMPH so that my hair no longer felt like the end of a broomstick. Itu2019s on point if that was what I was dressing up as for Halloween but NOT the vibe I was going for. The suggestion is to leave it in overnight. Doing so did not leave my pillow or face oily. In fact, because I love the sweet, subtle smell so much, I really loved the way it made my bed feel like a spa experience. The bottle is well packaged. The quality of the glass, the dropped, and the beautiful label really makes this feel very luxe. I have so far used this every time I need to wash my hair (4x a week) and I maintain that this oil makes me feel like a million bucks!"

PROu2019s: - Easy to use dropper. - Easy to incorporate into hair routine - Scalp feels clean  - Leaves hair soft, silky and shiny - Comes in recyclable packaging  I have been using Fable & Mane HoliRoots Hair Oil for 3 weeks.  This pre wash root treatment oil comes in a glass bottle with a dropper dispenser.  It has an earthy floral scent.  It is very easy to apply by parting your hair, applying to the scalp and massaging it into the scalp roots.  I have used this overnight as well as 5 minutes prior washing my hair.  I used this in conjunction with my regular shampoo and conditioner (not HoliRoots brand).  I have long, color treated hair and havenu2019t noticed any change to my hair growth.  However, I do notice that after using this my hair is shinier and softer.  Even though this is an oil, it does not weigh my hair down.  Overall this is a great product from the ease of application to the look and feel of hair once dried.  I will continue to use this as part of my weekly routine and hope to see additional positive results like hair growth and strength.    #holiroots #influenster"

I have straight brunette fine hair that currently has no color and I use minimal heat. I tried this once as a pre wash treatment where I let it sit for 10 minutes and another where I did an overnight treatment. The smell is really great and subtle. Definitely smells luxurious. Itu2019s not a super thick oil so a little bit can go far on the scalp. I even put some extra on my hand and it gave a really nice glow and absorbed pretty quickly without a sticky residue like some other oils. With the first pre wash 10 minute treatment I did notice my hair was very shiny and it felt really soft while rinsing out in the shower. I can say the same thing for the overnight treatment - in the morning it was mostly absorbed on my scalp so it wasnu2019t super crazy oily. I did put a lot on my ends as well and in the morning they were very shiny and probably too much to go out of the house with but it felt very soft while rinsing in the shower. I do think it soothed my scalp a little bit as it does feel less itchy. My hair isnu2019t super damaged to begin with so I canu2019t really say it improved much other than adding lots of shine. I appreciate that the ingredients are cruelty free, vegan, and have no silicones. Iu2019m excited to build a better foundation by having healthier roots but would have to use this product longer to really notice a difference. Overall it is lightweight, soothing, and gives great shine and softness."

This keeps my hair shiny and healthy. After a few times trying the Fable and Mane, I plan to gift this to my daughter and return to my beloved Olaplex oil.

I have long ( almost to my waist) black Asian hair and even though I donu2019t have a lot of issues with my hair, I wanted a little boost to enhance shine and vitality. I was not disappointed- the application is simple, just a few drops on my scalp and rub it in and through your hair. A little goes a long way so donu2019t go overboard. I let the oil do itu2019s job, I left it in for a few hours to let it really absorb. The smell is heaven- I felt like I was in a spa! The formula is light and itu2019s not greasy, but you definitely have to wash your hair two times to ensure itu2019s not leaving a heavy residue. I let my hair air dry as always and WOW. The shine is similar to having a professional gloss applied but without the chemicals that typically damage your hair. My hair is shining and so soft. I received multiple compliments and my daughter (22 and has light brown hair) even used ir. I have added this to my Sunday self care routine because I love the results. I highly recommend!!"

It smells amazing, and somehow after shampooing this out my hair still smells like it, if you prefer unscented or lightly scented products this isn't for you. I'd prefer it that way but it does smell good. Feels so good, immediate results as far as softer hair. Works better than any conditioner and when using this I simply don't need condition. I'm not a fan as a leave in overnight treatment, maybe if I had a cap or something because it's an oil. I've only used it for a few weeks so I can't speak to growth or strength but my hair has never felt healthier."

Results after shampoing and conditioning was it left my dry hair feeling moisturized and my hair had a shine to it. I have not used it long enough to see if it really helps with thinning but feel the product is something that I would add to my hair regime and I am interested in trying other products from this range.

Since this is a pre-wash, I didn't feel like this impacted my hair routine much at all and my hair certainly didn't feel oily or anything after washing (and it hasn't gotten oily any faster than normal). All in all, I like this added pre-wash oil and I like that the ingredients are relatively clean. My only complaint would be that I felt like I needed a lot of oil for one application (keep in mind my hair and scalp are pretty dry) so I feel like I might go through this pretty fast and it's not cheap.

Not only does this hair oil smell so good but it makes your hair softer than you can possibly have imagined. Before I had trying this oil, I was quite skeptical since I hated hair oils so much due to them always making my hair feel worse than ever. The oils I used before always tended to weigh my hair down, make it fall out even more, and made my scalp quite dry. However, after using this oil, I'm motivated to oil my hair every week which for me is quite a big deal!!! All you need is a few drops depending on your hair length and just start applying from your scalp to roots(which is what I did), since a healthy scalp will eventually lead to healthy hair growth but you can apply it in any order you'd prefer. You'd also want to leave it in for a few hours or even overnight before washing your hair. Another thing that I loved about this oil specifically was that it was super easy to wash out unlike other oils that would just not come out within one wash. Overall, this hair oil has become a main aspect of my haircare routine and it has also led me to love and take care of my hair which is why you guys need to try it out."

I received this product for free from Influenster and Fable & Mane in exchange for my honest review.  The first thing I noticed was the packaging. It looks and feels so luxurious. You can tell they put a lot of time and effort into the packaging. Itu2019s a beautiful addition to anyoneu2019s vanity.  The product itself smells amazing.  I would describe the scent as spicy but it also is light and floral at the same time. It isnu2019t too strong and overpowering and washes out so it may still work for people who are sensitive to strong fragrance.   I have used this four times now and my hair is loving it. I didnu2019t think Iu2019d need to take a before and after photo because, frankly, I assumed like any other hair oil Iu2019ve tried that it would make my hair too oily. When I first tried it, I used a small amount (maybe half a dropper) and focused it mostly on my scalp and a little less on the ends. I left it on for an hour before I washed it out. I used a shampoo brush while rinsing and shampooing to make sure I rinsed away all the oil. I did double shampoo as well that first use, just to be safe. When I got out of the shower, I brushed my hair and was pleasantly surprised to discover my hair was easy to brush through. I wasnu2019t expecting this to be detangling. I then let my hair air dry.   I woke up the next day with silky, shiny hair. I was also in awe to discover my hair was not oily the next dayu2026. Or the next. Three days post-wash and my hair was just as oily as it usually is without this product, and just as shiny and silky as the first day. I was not expecting that. I can confidently say this is a new holy grail product for me and Iu2019ll repurchase.  Now, after several more uses, I no longer feel double-shampooing is necessary to avoid grease. If your hair is oily, I recommend using a shampoo brush to really make sure the product is rinsed out."

To help prevent fallout (which is constant - I have male-pattern baldness, so I am also using minoxidil and Propecia daily along with red light therapy), I usually opt to wash my hair every 3rd day while using dry shampoo between washes. When using the dry shampoo alone after washing/towel drying, my hair can sometimes feel too dry. I find that when I apply an entire dropper of this after drying my hair and letting it sit for 5-10 minutes before using the dry shampoo, it makes my hair look and feel less dry while also giving it more body - it really makes my hair feel so nice. The fragrance reads to me as soft floral - almost like lily, white jasmine, lilac, etc. Eventhough it has a subtle/pleasant smell, I am super sensitive to fragranced products, so this one is hard for me to wear overnight unless I also spray it with unscented dry shampoo. That is the only reason I gave it 4/5 starts. If it was fragrance-free, or contained less fragrance, this would have been a 5/5 in my book."

I have fine hair but a lot of it, bleached and dry on the ends but oily at the scalp. I could feel this working right away as it kind of tingles your head. I left this on for only 10 minutes but it still does the trick. It doesn't feel like it rinses completely from the hair even after shampooing, ect but once I dry my hair, it looks soft and healthy. The only thing that I don't love is the fact that the oil rinses off onto your face and body if you do this while in the shower."

I only wash my hair once a week- it never gets oily, but it does get frizzy. The smell is a little strong for my taste, particularly since I need to use a lot of it (like, several droppers full of oil). I apply to my scalp after brushing out my curls, massage thoroughly, brush through, then apply additional oil to the rest of my hair. I then put my hair in a bun and leave it until I shampoo in the morning. My hair completely soaks this in. My hair is well conditioned after washing/conditioning (I use olapex 4 and 5), and I have noticed much less frizz throughout the week, and less scalp dryness. I will definitely repurchase after testing."

I needed about 5 droppers of this oil for my roots and long hair. I was worried that it would make my scalp oiler since I have never used hair oil like this before.  This lightweight oil felt so nice when I massaged this on my scalp and in my hair. The fragrance made me enjoy the whole experience. After I rinsed it out, shampooed, and conditioned my hair, I noticed that it did not leave my hair oily but more nourished and healthier. My hair felt hydrated, and my scalp felt clean and refreshed. I have been wanting to focus more on scalp care so I was so excited that I was given this opportunity to try this. This is a must-have for your hair care ritual. I highly recommend this!! This will be a permanent part of my hair care routine."

It is too soon to notice any extreme growth from this product, however I absolutely am noticing a vast improvement in the overall condition of my hair. When I use this before shampooing, my hair Becomes extremely shiny, Soft, and extraordinarily more healthy looking. It seems quite probable that such immediate improvement after having only use this product a few times could and probably should Result in more hair growth down the road. On top of that, this product smells amazing! Many are mixed on the scent, but I personally much prefer using a product that smells delicious over something that smells like the natural Earthy smell it would most likely have if no fragrance were added. While I do not like fragrance in skin care, I have no problem with it being added to hair products. I am also using two drops of this on the ends of my hair after shampooing only on the ends And most damaged areas. This is proving to be a good combination for me - Using both as pre-shampoo and a couple drops was leave in. When using as leave In, It is important to me that it smells good for styling purposes and this delivers. I am looking forward to trying more products from this line and Iu2019m grateful a product like this exists."

I use about 12-16 drops, massaging about 4 drops at a time on to my scalp. I work it all over my scalp, then run the excess thru my hair (focusing in the ends because I get split ends). I've left it in for anywhere from 4 hours to overnight. I get better results with keeping it in overnight. Then, I double shampoo leaving the second shampoo in while I wash. It washes right out.  Some say the smell is too strong. I highly disagree! The scent is very exotic. A nice relaxing woodsy and floral scent that dissipates quickly. It leaves my hair smelling great! I would recommend this hair oil and plan to buy another bottle after I run out. A little goes a long way. This bottle will last a long while."

I really like this product, a lot more than I expected I would. I can't speak on any hair growth because I've only tried this product a few times but overall I really like it. To start, this product smells really really good. I don't like overpowering scents in my hair products, but this scent is light and musky and it clings to the hair and is so relaxing. I like putting the oil on at night before bed and then washing in the morning because it's very calming. The Instructions say to leave it on at least five minutes and up to overnight. I've done both with success. I have a lot of hair which makes it tough to get hair oils, serums, or scrubs on the scalp. This product comes with a long dropper which makes it very easy to apply the product to the scalp. My scalp feels very hydrated which is great because it's so dry naturally.  The thing I was surprised the most about was how soft my hair was after it dried. I followed my normal routine (the instructions say to follow up with their shampoo and I don't have that, and I don't normally use shampoo.) My hair is super super soft. All of it. Not just the roots. The oil makes my hair very hydrated and so so soft. I have very curly mostly 3B with a little 3 C hair that is usually dry dry dry. This stuff is amazing! These are just a few cons to it. One is that it says to use a dropperful of oil per use. My dropper cant suck up a dropperful, so I have to eyeball it. It also is a lot of oil for the size of the bottle. The formula is drippy, which is great for getting it on the scalp and hair, but also means some of it drips off where it shouldn't at times. And the third con is that it makes my hair darker when I use it. It's usually on the roots around where it was applied, but one time most of the hair was darker.  This product is a solid 4.5/5!"

Honestly, I didn't even realize how dry my scalp was, until I used this product.  The directions suggest using before washing or leaving in over night, I actually leave on for several hours before I wash my hair during the day.

I have very dry skin and that of course includes my scalp, so this was perfect for me. I have definitely noticed a difference as far as my scalp being less dry and itchy. I canu2019t honestly say that Iu2019ve noticed any difference in my hair yet. I found that I have a better experience with applying directly to the scalp with the dropper than trying to put on my hands and then applying. The packaging is so nice and cute, and I do like that the bottle and dropper are both glass. The only thing I would change is that I wish the dropper picked up more product at a time. I could only get it to fill 1/4 of the way. Itu2019s a pretty big dropper, so that probably wonu2019t be too big of an issue for most people but I use a lot at a time and I just want to keep applying more because it really is nice. I also really enjoyed getting on the Fable and Mane website and reading about their work with endangered tigers. Amazing!"

I recently moved back to my desert hometown after years in a more humid climate, and my poor scalp has been a little flaky ever since. This is like moisturizer for my head. It looks better but also FEELS better, not itchy and dry. There is a fragrance, a light floral to my nose, and its just fine. Not strong and offensive. However I'm taking away a star because my hair smells.... a little bit musty after it has time to dry, though that does fade away quickly. This might just be the product with my own chemistry, because it's never happened before. I'll continue to use it though, I asked a few people if I smelled weird and no one told me I did, so it must be okay!"

The smell is faint, I wish it were stronger personally. I had an issue getting the oil in the dropper for some reason, I was only able to suction up a small amount each time so I had to constantly keep dipping the dropper into the bottle which was super annoying. To cover my whole head I probably had to dip back in a dozen times and my hair is very short so those with long and thick hair may have a frustrating endeavor on their hands here.   All of this aside, the oil was easy to wash out and has left my hair very soft and shiny! Oddly, it also gave me a lot of volume, even when my hair was wet it was very fluffy. It's hard to say if it's helped with growth but I will continue to use it and I do hope it helps with growth because my hair is regrowing from me being bald about a year ago so I'm anxious for my hair to be back"

I added a few droppers of oil to my lightened areas ( I know this is a scalp treatment, but thought why not see how it does on already damaged hair).  I was amazed at how soft and easy my hair was to comb after wetted.  My hair was incredibly shiny and soft, much different than normal after a lightening."

After washing, my hair wasnu2019t as tangled as before.   The scent itself is on the strong side, but not too overpowering. It mentions that it is an Indian inspired scent, and I can confirm that it has a sweet, woody fragrance.   Can also easily be used as a leave-in conditioner. Just beware to not use too much, as it is an oil base, so will leave your hair looking too greasy.   Overall a good product that Iu2019d buy again and recommend!"

I have to admit that I only used the product once due to frequency of hair washing. Also, the directions state to follow up with Fable & Mane shampoo, which I did not. As such, I am not sure if this impacts the efficacy of the product. Additionally, because I only used it once, I am giving it 4 stars.  For reference, I have fine hair that is color treated. The instructions say to leave the oil on for 5 minutes or overnight. Sephorau2019s website instructs you to leave it on for 10 minutes or overnight. With that said I left it on for about 15 minutes prior to washing. 1. I absolutely love the smell. Itu2019s not overpowering and itu2019s pleasant. 2. It feels more like a dry oil, which is characteristic of high end oils (I am a Herbivore fan). 3. The instructions say use at LEAST one dropper. So I used more all over my head. I have to say it did not leave my scalp any more oily than 5 day greasy hair. Needless to say, it felt good to wash it. 4. Due to my hair being fine, I donu2019t like to add a lot of product, especially at the roots. I dried my hair as usual and it does not feel heavy or weighed down AND it tamed flyaways (the little hairs on top of my head are not reaching for the stars). Overall, 4 stars for a first time use and have not yet experienced second day hair. Another note, I am a harsh with critiques. I have no problem spending hard earned money, but the product needs to live up to the hype, and so far, so good."

I honestly have nothing bad to say about this product. 100 out of 10. Plus the amount you have to use is very little and the bottle is1.8 fl oz so it will last awhile.

I just recently colored my hair (5 days before using this) and washed it twice with my normal products before trying this. When applying the oil, the viscosity was a bit thin to me and all of it would not stay in the dropper. Some of it dripped onto the counter as I was applying. I left this on for 5 minutes and did my normal shampoo/conditioner. After did my normal routine (leave in conditioner, olaplex 6&7) and blow dried after air drying for 3 hours. When I was blow drying I could still smell the scalp oil in my hair (light gardenia scent) but I donu2019t normally like strong scents in my hair. The next morning I woke up and the smell was gone and didnu2019t notice a difference in my hair honestly. My hair is pretty healthy and not very damaged or prone to breakage even though it has been dyed. Perhaps this would be useful for someone whose hair is more damaged but I probably wouldnu2019t buy this again. I received this product complimentary for testing."

When opening it, I noticed the dropper only picks up about a third of the total dropper. However the consistency is very thin so if you had too much in the dropper I feel like it would just get everywhere. The scent is strong and this is the main reason for 4 stars. I put this product on at the end of the night and slept in it as they recommend for best results. But since itu2019s just sitting there and you arenu2019t washing it out right away, itu2019s just a tad too strong. Not a bad scent but too much is overwhelming. My hope is long term use of this product will allow me to go an extra day without washing. I find that my roots get oily quickly and hopefully this product will resolve that. Overall I think itu2019s worth the price point and would purchase again if I see results."

The packaging is decent but I wish that the same amount of energy spent on making it look nice had gone into the user experience. The instructions say to use at least one dropper full on each section of hair but the dropper never fills up more than 1/3 of its capacity. Massaging the scalp increases blood flow and doing so regularly would result in hair growth so I guess I'm just at a loss for what makes this particular product noteworthy whatsoever.

This oil was easy to apply as the dropper is top notch. It spread well and my scalp had no reactions. I leave it on about 30 minutes then wash normally with shampoo and conditioner. My hair is noticeably softer and smooth. It isn't any shinier but wasn't dulled either. To be honest with such quickly oily roots I am happy it didn't boost the shine. Now to my favourite part, the scent. It is so warm and chic yet very familiar and welcoming. It smells like proper perfume but in the most subtle way. It's not at all overpowering. I find myself dabbing it on my pulse points as it's such a cheering scent. They need to sell it as a fragrance and in body care too. I may have been sent this but I will absolutely repurchase."

I applied it to my scalp/down to the ends and then slept with my hair up on in a bonnet overnight. When I washed it out in the morning, I had to shampoo twice. My hair felt really soft but I did feel like this made my hair oilier faster. I felt like I had to wash my hair earlier than I usually would. I think it is very nourishing. I would use it once every week at most. But my hair is processed and damaged from bleach. I think this product made a difference. I felt like my hair was softer and more moisturized after one use. I think the scent is really nice, itu2019s not too strong which will be good for people who donu2019t like strong scents. Really excited to try more things from this sister owned brand!"

I was hesitant to see perfume as the second ingredient (which is why 1 star is taken off) because the nature of the ingredient is not disclosed. That concern was alleviated by how good the hair oil smells!! Still, I would have loved for this to be all natural, perfume included. My hair is very oily and this has helped my scalp produce somewhat less oil between washes. I enjoy using it either 20 min before washing my hair or (less often) overnight. The ingredients are definitely unique to this hair oil, as I alternate between a few different types of oils. I will probably repurchase when this is done, but the bottle definitely is going to go a long way. There is a lot of product inside!"

This hair oil is amazing if you have a dry scalp, thinning hair and need overall nourishment. I received this complimentary from Influenster for my honest opinion and I couldnu2019t be more thankful. I applied this for the first time yesterday as soon as I received my box. I have fine, thin, super long hair thatu2019s prone to breakage and I bleached it a platinum blonde hue 2 years ago which roughed up my hair to say the least and Iu2019m currently growing out my hair and Iu2019m on a hair health journey, if you will. Yesterday happened to be my hair wash day anyway (I wash my hair twice a week). I applied a dropper full to my palm and rubbed my hands together to warm up the product. Then, I applied half a dropper to the lengths and ends of my hair to make sure they get some love and nourishment too. I let it sit in my hair for about 5 hours (you can leave it on overnight too). I rinsed it out with lukewarm water first and then I shampooed and conditioned as usual. I let my hair air dry because Iu2019m trying not to use as much heat on my hair lately. First thing I noticed when my hair was mostly dry is that my hair looked much shinier and felt a little thicker and definitely smoother from my root to ends. I was super impressed by how well this worked so quickly. I plan on using this twice a week on both hair wash days so I can enjoy healthy looking and feeling hair and I canu2019t feel wait to see more benefits with long time use over the course of the next few months. I will be repurchasing this during the Sephora VIB sale in the next few weeks!"

Also, I really like and enjoy the smell (it made my pillow smell amazing too), but I can see it being off-putting to people who don't like scented products.  I've used it as a treatment oil on my scalp and also as a hair oil to apply after I wash my hair. I've always had trouble with argan oil or jojoba oil (other hair oils) weighing my fine hair down and just making it look greasy, but this oil soaks right into my hair strands and makes them look really bouncy and shiny (granted I only use like a drop or two max for the hair strands). All in all, I am very happy with this product and will repurchase the larger size when I am done with the travel size."

Not only does this hair oil smell so good but it makes your hair softer than you can possibly have imagined. Before I had purchased this oil, I was quite skeptical since I hated hair oils so much due to them always making my hair feel worse than ever. The oils I used before always tended to weigh my hair down, make it fall out even more, and made my scalp quite dry. However, after using this oil, I'm motivated to oil my hair every week which for me is quite a big deal!!!  All you need is a few drops depending on your hair length and just start applying from your scalp to roots(which is what I did), since a healthy scalp will eventually lead to healthy hair growth but you can apply it in any order you'd prefer. You'd also want to leave it in for a few hours or even overnight before washing your hair.  Another thing that I loved about this oil specifically was that it was super easy to wash out unlike other oils that would just not come out within one wash.   Overall, this hair oil has become a main aspect of my haircare routine and it has also led me to love and take care of my hair which is why you guys need to try it out."

Itu2019s so strong that the smell stayed in my hands, I had to wash it multiple times. I applied the oil before going to bed so I can sleep with it, the smell disturbed my sleep and it completely passed on my pillow. I couldnu2019t properly sleep all night.

I noticed right away it smells very good, and also the oil is not heavy, probably due to the sesame. I left it in for a few hours, then washed out with my usual shampoo. My hair smelled good and felt good after, but to be frank, it wasn't a standout. I have other oils that have more natural ingredients (perfume is the second ingredient on this!) and they are easier to apply. I will probably keep this and just use to the end of the bottle, but I don't see myself buying it again. I can't comment if it helps hair grow because I haven't had it long enough and so far only used it once.

After a normal shampoo and condition my fair feels clean and not oily! the best part is when my hair dries.. it has a natural wave and body that I haven't seen  in such a long time, just from air drying. It feels full even tho I don't really have that much hair. Everytime I use it my bf tells me my hair looks cute when it dries. if you're sensitive to smells I guess it could be abnoxious, but I love it. It smells like a floral perfume, but it isn't overly strong for me and I love the scent. Just bought the shampoo and conditioner because I love how this makes my hair look and feel."

The headband mitigates the strong perfume smell and the heat accelerates the process and when I shower, the oil comes out easily and my hair is super soft and bouncy and my scalp feels really good.

I donu2019t know what it is but it instantly calmed my scalp. It was very soothing and left my hair very soft.

I wear it in tight braids, and sleep on it and wake up to a birds nest. I'm super rough on my hair and it's always been a huge struggle. I've always wanted to grow it out super long but it gets so frizzy and dry and awful that I give up. My roots get oily and nasty too.  I started using this once a week and will progress to twice or more (I only wash 1-2 times a week now). I massage it into my scalp upside down and then section my hair and use a boar bristle brush to evenly spread and distribute it in each section of hair down to my ends. My hair is long enough I'll use a few more drops in my ends usually too. I then leave it in for at least 2 hours if not more, and then shampoo with Gisou honey shampoo and conditioner and gently blow dry just the roots to keep them cleaner for longer. MY HAIR IS SO NICE NOW!! I finally have a good relationship with my hair. It is growing in glossy and thick and fast (my hair naturally grows fast but this is fast even for me) and frizz is gone. I think a lot of it has to do with the boar bristle brush and distributing the oils through each strand, but this product is fantastic and has seemed to balance out my oily and dry scalp so that it is now pretty normal and just feels clean. The smell is so delicious, I wish they made a mist with it. Absolutely worth a try!! I have tried everything at sephora, natural oils, you name it. This is truly lovely!"

I was looking into oils to try and help my hair/scalp health. I had TONS of hair falling out in the shower. Like, enough that I was wondering if I was sick or if something else seriously wrong was going on. I stumbled upon this when it first came to Sephora and it had some great reviews so I gave it a shot. I have never looked back. The smell is delicious, think beach/island vibes. But the results are what make this worth every penny. After using this for a couple months (overnight at least once a week) my hair shedding is down to almost nothing. Literally there is so little hair falling out in the shower I donu2019t even need to clean the drain. And this is after 3 or 4 days of wearing my curly hair up. Which anyone who has curly hair knows, especially if itu2019s up, that their will be pretty major shedding when you shower. Itu2019s normal to lose about 50-100 strands of hair a day and curly hair gals see it more in the shower because curly hair tends to trap the stands that get shed. So when I have almost 0 shedding after not washing for a few days.....thatu2019s borderline black magic status. My advice is to try it. 1 bottle should be enough to see results. But guess what. It also makes your hair super healthy and seems to make it thicker as well. PLUS your scalp benefits. I use to not be able to go more than 2 days without washing my hair. I have fine curly hair and it would just get greasy fast. After using this oil my scalp regulates itself much better and I donu2019t deal with the greasiness that I use to, like at all, unless I go 4+ days without washing. AGAIN. THIS STUFF IS HOLY GRAIL. BUY IT."

Second, I wish there were more instructions on how often to use it. Third, it seems odd that it's the same amount for all types and length of hair, no?  The bottle is small, so I'd imagine if this was a semi-regular routine I might look for another brand -- or just castor oil (which is like the only ingredient outside of perfume).

This is the first product I tried so nothing else changed.  I have put about 3 - 4 drops in where my hair is most thin and massaged at the roots/scalp, leaving on overnight. This is a big risk as my hair used to be very oily and requires a shampoo daily or the oil starts to return.   I have left this on overnight and washed my hair in the morning for five days. I have noticed a huge increase in body, my hair feels healthy and strong from roots to tip, and my brunette hair has taken on a deeper, more powerful color tone. I am so impressed. I was so worried about greasiness using an oil but this has saved my hair. I hope it will also help grow new hairs but time will tell.   The scent is light, earthy, almost like almonds or other nuts.   I hope this review helps someone who is also hesitant about oiliness or has fine straight hair."

I use it twice a week when I wash, leaving it in for a few hours and washing and conditioning like normal. Wow! Itu2019s made such a difference! My hair is much smoother, feels healthier and when straightened it behaves much better!  The smell is nice, earthy and woody. I have hair to my mid back and use about 6 dropper amounts each time I use it, so it will last a while."

My hair is softer, bouncier, and feels cleaner. In my opinion, there is not much of a scent, it is much different than the shampoo and conditioner. If anything, itu2019s a very faint, natural, earthy scent that washes right out, it does not linger.   I most definitely recommend this if youu2019re trying to get healthier hair, it really helped mine."

If you have never tried a pre-wash hair oil before, you are missing out. And if you have, then you NEED this! It is amazing stuff!"

First of all the scent is strong, it bothers me sometimes but I just do t leave it in for longer than a few hours before washing. Iu2019m a little jealous because the review said it made their hair soft and shiny and it didnu2019t for me . Maybe 30% shiner but nothing crazy, I wish it helped with my tangles, my ends still feel knotted and rough. HOWEVER I will keep this because it did basically clear my whole scalp and my flakes and itch  are completely gone!  Also I had a serious hair fall issue and I noticed after the SECOND time that my hair fall was really really minimal. Iu2019m just so happy to have my hair stop falling out that I will continue to use this. This has saved my hair and scalp!"

My hair is definitely shinier and healthier. My hair texture looks more wavy and less frizzy if I let it air dry. My hairdresser said she thought it looked thicker as well, but I will say it's not a dramatic difference. I unfortunately still have tons of fallout. However, because of how much healthier this has made my hair, I still think it's a great product and will continue using it. A little bit goes a long way. The scent seems to be pretty polarizing. It is a strong scent, but I personally think it smells amazing and luxurious. My overall takeaway is that this doesn't perform miracles but it will likely improve the health of your hair with regular use."

I have a lot of hair, its thick, 2A and black. I do not have a sensitive scalp whatsoever, which is why I was so terrified and disturbed when (after leaving it in for the overnight treatment) I found my hair coming out in clumps in the shower. The problem did not stop there, my hair was dull and heavy so I washed it again, and while it fixed my hair, my scalp had dandruff and was incredibly itchy.  I tried again the following week, leaving it in for only one hour. This time it was better and I remained using it this way for about one week. When I stopped for a few days, my hair started to fall out double what it had ever fallen out IN MY LIFE.  This has never happened to me before. I have been doing olive oil, argan oil and rosehip oil treatments weekly for my hair since I was 14, so clearly oil is not my issue. My theory is that the fragrance (the THIRD ingredient by the way) is just as overwhelming to the scalp as it is to the nose.  To say I am upset is a massive understatement, I LOVE my hair more than anything and this has been extremely distressing, my scalp is still itchy and I am still losing more hair than ever before.  I know this product works well for a lot of people, but I felt like I just needed to share what an absolute mess this product was for me."

First, the fragrance, while nice, is strong for my taste. Second, in order to massage it into my whole scalp and run it lightly through the length of my hair, took over 4 full stoppers of the oil. That being said, this bottle will be empty very soon. Does it make my hair feel soft? Sure, but so does good ole Extra Virgin Olive Oil.  Economically, this is NOT a good value. For less than 2 ounces, you're paying over $30 with tax/shipping which is way too much. If it were a larger bottle, then I would say for sure it was worth the money. I go to India often and I feel like over there, I could pick up a bottle of similar oils blended together for less than $5 and in a much larger size.  It's too bad, because I really wanted to like this, but it's just a mediocre, overpriced product."

I use this as a weekly treatment on days off or if I take a bath, and leave it in my hair for honestly like two hours. Sometimes more. You will look and feel like a greased chicken while it's in, and I find the scent really pleasant and warm. But after you wash, oh LORD, it's night and day. I use a purple shampoo (which can be drying) and follow with their conditioner too. My hair is SO soft, shining and absolutely radiant when I emerge from my scalding hot shower.

I struggle with frizzy and dry hair due to bleaching and years of using bad drug store shampoos. I bought this and the shampoo and conditioner line and my hair has changed a lot. Itu2019s gotten healthier for sure. My hair is soft, shiny and the frizziness has reduced A LOT. I havenu2019t used hair spray in awhile to tame my frizz. On top of that my hair grew like crazy. I use this oil as an overnight hair mask mixed with my other oils and then I wash it out the next day. Also the smell is Fab. Smells like luxurious perfume so if you donu2019t mind fragrants then I recommend this! I also like to put this oil on my ends everyday and because it gives a gorgeous shine to it :)"

The strength of the scent did not dissipate at all for me.  I did the overnight method, and my scalp hair does feel smoother and my scalp feels cleaner after just one use.  I estimate I could get at least 6 uses, maybe more if I was careful out of this bottle, but it is being gifted to my friend who I know will love the scent. Please make an unscented version!!!"

After rinsing, it leaves my hair very soft and silky. Lastly. I just adore the smell of fable and Mane which is a major plus for me."

I was freaked out about sleeping with an oil in my hair, worried it would break me out, but the oil absorbs well and I have had no skin issues whatsoever. After washing and drying my hair, it feels fuller, cleaner, and healthier! And the smell is divine, so luxurious. I am so glad I tried this product, Iu2019m now hooked! I have fine, colour treated 2B curls"

Highly recommend!!!"

My hair is usually very thick and full but lately Iu2019ve been on a new medication and unfortunately one of the side effects can be hair loss. Iu2019d say when I bought this oil I was at about 50% of my normal hair volume. I bought this oil thinking if it helped great, donu2019t expect miracles, at the very least Iu2019d have extremely soft hair.  All of that being said, after 2-3 weeks of daily (or almost daily) use I can definitely feel and see a difference in the volume of my hair; maybe 70% now? I donu2019t mind the smell, which is quite floral, but not overpowering in my opinion. The oil itself is very light and I find it doesnu2019t weigh my hair down. Iu2019ve even applied a couple days in a row (no wash between) and found my hair still didnu2019t look greasy. And it does help make my hair quite soft.   So Iu2019d say it was definitely worth the shot."
