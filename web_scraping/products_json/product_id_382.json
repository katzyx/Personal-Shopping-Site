    "about": "Fragrance Family:Floral.Scent Type:Powdery Floral.Key Notes:Amber, Moroccan Jasmine, Sandalwood.Fragrance Description:A lighter way to indulge in the Cashmere Mist collection, this eau de toilette is a sublime whisper of cashmere, combining essences of amber, Moroccan jasmine, and warm sandalwood. Beautifully fresh and subtle, the scent is perfect for wearing all year long..About the Bottle:Designed by Donna Karanu2018s late husband, sculptor Stephen Weiss, the iconic Cashmere Mist Eau de Toilette bottle mirrors the beautiful contours and lines of the female form in glass.",
    "ingredients": "Alcohol Denat., Water, Fragrance, Butylphenyl Methylpropional, Benzyl Salicylate, Alpha-Isomethyl Ionone, Linalool, Coumarin, Limonene, Hydroxycitronellal, Benzyl Benzoate, Geraniol, Citronellol, Hexyl Cinnamal, Citral, Farnesol, Benzyl Cinnamate, Benzyl Alcohol, Eugenol.",
    "how_to_use": "Suggested Usage:.-Fragrance is intensified by the warmth of your own body. Apply in the creases of your knees and elbows for a longer-lasting, stronger scent.&nbsp;.-After applying, avoid rubbing or dabbing skin. This breaks down the fragrance, causing it to wear off more quickly.&nbsp;.-If you prefer placing fragrance on your wrists, be sure to reapply after frequent hand-washing, as this tends to rinse off the scent.&nbsp;.-Replace fragrance after 12 months. Expired perfumes more than a year old lose the integrity of the original scent... Eau de Toilette or Eau de Parfum?: .The difference lies in the volume of perfume oil. While EDT contains five to nine percent, EDP contains more, usually eight to 14 percent. EDPs, therefore, last longer and smell more intense.",

If you donu2019t care for those cloying fruity florals that every brand seems to put out, give this a try. A little goes a long way but it is warm, sexy, and comforting all at the same time. It is floral but not overwhelming or headache inducing as some jasmine/lily perfumes can be. Itu2019s blended well so that you canu2019t really pick out one note, it all works together seamlessly. I get the most compliments when I wear this. Try the deodorant too!"

I somehow became the owner of a large bottle (had no idea how much it actually $$!) which sat dressers and vanitys as I grew and moved around for years until I got rid of it last year. Recently, I smelled a mag insert and it came across as softly seductive, clean, comfortable, powdery, and musky. Perfect for when you want to smell like you just naturally smell good. Anyhow, tried it again because I never HATED it...it just didn't..'work' for me. However this time is totally different! I've had it on for hours and I smell exactly like the mag insert still! Maybe my nose matured, maybe my body chemistry changed, I'm sure it has. That makes ALL the difference."

My friend and I thought it smelled like cinnamon at first, though it is not one of the perfume's notes. After a few minutes the spiciness dried down to a warm powdery musk that overwhelmingly reminded me of my mother. She wears Coty Vanilla Musk and Jovan White Musk, so that's what this reminds me of, but Cashmere Mist is more powdery and less intense than either. Cashmere Mist reminds me of a cross between a creamy musk and baby powder. It is a warm, comforting scent. If I had to describe it in one word, I would say it is maternal. It is a grown up fragrance. I'd recommend it for women 25+ and think it would be lovely on a woman in her 40's and 50's. I can't really picture a woman younger than 25 wearing this. It would make a good everyday fragrance."

The theory of  powdery old lady smell can be determined by YOUR ENTIRE STYLE THAT DAY! because if you use it with trendy elegant outfit, people will like it, and consider it part of being delicate and elegant that day! But if you ware it with boring, or cheap looking styles, YOU will trigger the idea of old lady SO if you personally like it and know what you gonna ware with, trust yourself! But I still consider it better for day time, fantasy offices, or casual evenings."

I think it was developed for people with sensitivities. Thank You DK for it. I can smell clean, light , and fresh all day. And I have never had anyone say anything except good things about the smell. I have worn it for at least 7 years. I also use the deodorant. Perfect."

I tried liking it but it ruined my sweater and my bedroom and I'm going to need to return it. I bought this because for at least eight years I've pined after the paper samples from the catalogue. but I will never buy this musky funeral perfume again."

Cashmere Mist will NEVER go out of style. It is the perfect fragrance, and evokes a feeling of pampered luxury, yet, at the same time, casual elegance. I cannot say enough about it. I am just so IN LOVE with Cashmere Mist! And I love that there are so many products available - such as the anti-perspirant/deodorant & more. I would like to see a hair mist available, and maybe a body mist/spritzer, for light touch-ups throughout the day. That being said, I have absolutely no complaints.

One of my girlfriends has decided to do the same. Well worth the money spent. It doesn't take much either. I use Cashmere Mist Toilette, Parfum, deodorant/antiperspirant (yes, it really works in this catagory, too), and the body creme and lotion. Not as pricy as one would expect. Go for it! Try it! You won't be sorry. Sephora's free, no hassle return policy has us covered, anyway. Honestly, I can't tell you how many times someone has politely approached me asking what's the name is of that wonderful perfume you are wearing? Yes I do give Donna Karan's Cashmere Mist a 5 Star rating. It well deserves it."

It might be the suede notes, the sandlewood, the cedarwood, or perhaps the musk, or maybe it's a combination of those. I don't like the smell of cedar closets (which protect against moths), so maybe it's the cedarwood.

While this scent is very different from Brit, I like that it is similar in one respect: it has a woody, musky dry-down that comes out quickly after spritzing and is not overly floral (I really dislike pure florals - they all smell overwhelming on me).  Cashmere Mist is a great everyday fragrance - on me, it smells powdery and clean, but it also has hints of musk and wood notes in there, so it's not TOO clean. It's a subtly sexy smell... the kind of fragrance people tend to want to cuddle up to!"

It starts with a hint of jasmine, lily of the valley, and vanilla, and then develops into a warm, soft, sexy sandalwood and musk base. It is light enough for everyday, but also sexy enough for evenings. It's sexy in a subtle way. The shower lotion and body cream are a bit woodier than the perfume itself, but they work well to make the fragrance last. If you like Jovan Musk, (a CLASSIC sexy perfume), you will love this!"

However, back in PA now, I read all the nice reviews about the deodorant and decided to give it a try. I was surprised! I loved it! I'm never buying any other deodorant again. This one lasts all day, even through the summer heat, and the scent is actually quite mild and almost powdery but not like any of the other typical deodorant. I can get really sweaty but the anti-prespirant on this is excellent. Plus, if layered on with the lotion and the perfume (I have both eau de toilette and elixer), you just smell overall nice. All you need is one spritz in one place or one dab of the elixer. I almost feel funny because now I feel like lifting my arms all the time just so I can smell it!"

While I do still have to wear an undershirt, the wetness has been cut by at least half. I am stunned every time I raise my arm and take a whiff right before my shower, THE NEXT DAY? STILL FRESH! My 8 year old son loves it too! When we read a bedtime story, he tickles me trying to snuggle as close as he can under my arm so he can smell it.. Your armpits smell really good, mom! Also, I have noticed the scent is additionally activated by heat, so, now when I sweat, I don't cringe like before... At least it means that we will alI be getting an awesome nose full of the Mist of Cashmere.... LOL I am on my second stick of it this summer :) Don't EVER change the recipie!!!!!!
