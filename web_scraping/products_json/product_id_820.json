I have pretty standard 3A curls, and I have recommended it to people with barely wavy hair to super coily hair, and they all love it too. Perfect for air drying or for diffusing, it makes my hair have zero frizz, it's light weight, and you don't need to scrunch out the crunch that much so you can use it and go out immediately without looking ridiculous. Once it dries you just need to fluff the roots a little bit with your fingers, scrunch lightly depending on how much product you used and your hair texture, and you're good to go! Soft, voluminous, bouncy, shiny hair. Great scent too."

I think air dry cream is great for days when I just want light hold or some protection from frizz when I'm not blow drying. It's easy to use (and difficult to mess up), and it only takes one minute to put through my hair. It's also great that there is such attention to ingredients and environmentally-conscious packaging. Thanks, JVN!"

I have thick, naturally wavy, frizzy hair, and I almost never use heat tools on my hair - partially to prevent damage and partially because I'm lazy when it comes to my hair. Lucky for me, this air dry cream alone accentuates my natural waves and smooths out frizz so well that I never feel like I am missing out by not blow drying/styling my hair! I also LOVE the scent - it is calming and smells like a high-quality salon product. I have recommended this to others and even given it as gifts, and everyone has fallen in love with it. This will be my go-to for life!"

I always use a leave in conditioner after my hair wash and when I went in with this my hair felt dry, but again it's rhe same feeling I would get if I used a hair moose.  as far as hold goes, it seems to do a pretty good Job. I just don't like the feeling of having moose in my hair.  I recommend if you use a hair oil, use the hair oil FIRST then go in with this product"

            "review_text": "JVN Hair has taken the hair world by storm, promising salon-worthy looks without the heat. Their Air Dry Cream is a popular product, but like any haircare hero, it has its strengths and weaknesses. Let's dive into the world of air-dried waves to see if this cream deserves a permanent spot on your bathroom shelf.  Love at First Sniff: One thing's for sure, JVN Air Dry Cream knows how to make an entrance. The scent is intoxicating, often described as a clean, citrusy floral that lingers long after application. It's like a mini salon experience every time you use it.  The Good Hair Days: When it comes to appearance, JVN Air Dry Cream delivers for many. It enhances natural waves and curls, adding body and definition without weighing hair down. Frizz is kept at bay, leaving you with sleek, polished strands that look effortlessly chic. Think beachy waves with a touch of sophistication.  Quality Concerns: Customers appreciate the high-quality ingredients and cruelty-free formula. The cream feels luxurious and applies smoothly, without any greasiness or stickiness.  The Tangled Tale: Now, here's where things get a little messy. Opinions on performance, texture, and frizz control are divided. Some rave about the cream's ability to define their curls and tame frizz, while others find it leaves their hair dry, stiff, or with unwanted crunch. The texture can also be a sticking point, with some describing it as too heavy or tacky.  The Final Verdict: JVN Air Dry Cream is a love story with some twists. It has the potential to elevate your air-dried look, offering salon-quality shine and definition. However, it's not a one-size-fits-all solution. If you have fine, easily weighed-down hair or struggle with dryness, proceed with caution. But for those with thicker hair or defined waves, it could be your new holy grail."

Haven't seen these attributes in a long time due to using bleach so many years..  lo and behold, received the trial size in my sephora delivery bag. Absolutely adore Jonathan, and tried it right away.  I was pretty shocked to feel my damaged blonde  shoulder blade length hair soft, wavy and HEALTHY looking. It literally looked like I styled it on purpose. Threw some dry shampoo in and walked out the door. Compliments at work too. Basically struck gold.  I think a little goes a long way. My hair is fine, so used a pea sized amount at first on damp hair. Let it do its thing and dry naturally. Hair felt like butter once dried.  When I want some lift, I'll work in a volumizing product into my roots and JVN at the ends.   Continuing to purchase full size because using it on my daughters butt length, thiiick wavy hair as well.  Works so great, been slowly phasing out other products as Air dry cream is getting the job done of 3 other prducts and is thankfully affordable.    I guess some noses are having an aversion to the smell? To be honest, I didnt think it had the most prominent scent when I first used it. It wasn't very strong or noticeable to me as a signature scent would be with other products.  Now that I think of it, it smells like the love child of Biosilk and Sebastian from back in the day.  Since I've moved on to the full size tube, passing along the barely used mini size to my hair colorist so she can try it as well."

I've used this as my only styling product on my last three wash days, and I absolutely love how my hair looks! My waves are defined and they last longer than they ever have before. I don't find that this dries my hair out at all or creates any frizz. It has a light, sweet scent that fades almost immediately once it's in my hair.

Because I've been an avid gel user for decades, I liked how this makes my hair slightly crunchy after it air dries, but once you comb it through there is no residue and no feeling of stiffness.

I do think that this helped to make my curls more defined but they were dry and my hair felt coarse. After an hour or so I noticed some of my curls turned into fluffy sections and I had to rewet them and add more product which was frustrating as this product seems to be advertised as a wash and go type situation. I think this would be better described as strictly a texturizing cream since I don't think it does anything for moisture, frizz, or hold. I bought the full size so I'm going to keep experimenting with it using different amounts and apply when my hair is more or less soaking wet to see if it makes any difference."

But since my hair is constantly undergoing color treatments, it gets dry and looks frizzy if I don't style it with tools after every wash. So needless to say, I was surprised at how this air dry cream really helped to smooth my frizziness and let my hair naturally be styled effortlessly. It also smells refreshingly great. Doesn't make my hair greasy or feel heavy. It just makes your hair look healthy and soft. I really am a fan."

It leaves my hair looking healthier, smoother and shinier and smelling like a hair salon! Overall, I'd recommend the product that's inside the component.  That being said, I HATE this packaging. In fact, I hate the packaging of two out of the three JVN products I've tried. This foil type tube is so hard to squeeze and once you get towards the bottom you end up wasting a fair bit of product. Want to cut it open and use the last of it that way? Don't. You'll cut yourself.   I really adore this product and it did last me a decent amount of time but the packaging is infuriating. I really hope they find a way to put this in a normal squeeze tube. I'm going to try a few other similar products with better packaging first but if they don't work out then I'd absolutely come back to this. Maybe I'll just have my boyfriend squeeze it out for me lol"

My hair looks full and soft and shiny after using.  Sometimes I combine w/a pump of Olaplex #6  * I'm not crazy about the smell.

I applied a good amount because I have a lot of hair and very long, it has a good scent not too overpowering, and a cream like  texture. It definitely tamed the frizz and gave some life to my hair.

I have been using this for a month now and I think I will discontinue it at this point. Does not work for me at all. Not only it makes my hair look greasy, it doesn't tame my frizz as well. She made me buy this cream and the hair oil from this same brand. She said to mix the two and apply throughout the hair.  I wash my hair after 2-3 days and usually don't have any buildup of oil. After using these two products I started noticing my hair got super greasy on the night of second day. By 3rd day it felt as if I had applied oil in my hair!!!  I started using each product individually and on the ends only even that didn't make a difference. Of course the top of my head wasn't as oily as I applied to end only, but still I like to tie my hair in a bun on top of my head and I think the residue transfers. Such a big tube and bottle, waste of money. Don't recommend this at all."

Instantly smooth hair, frizz gone, it looks so perfect. There's no left over residue, hair is soft and shiny, not weighed down at all. I was floored. I think it should also be marketed as a finishing cream cause that's where it shines. When I used it wet and let dry or styled it, it wasn't bad but prefer olaplex 6 over this. But I consider this a holy grail finishing cream. A little goes a long way, I hardly need a pea sized amount to smooth out my rib length hair. This product will last me a long time. I like that it has ingredients that improve hair health over time. Thumbs up!"

            "review_text": "Wow, where do I start with this *~aMaZiNg~* air dry cream that is now a staple in my hair routine? Firstly, I received this product complimentary from Influenster & JVN for reviewing purposes. Now that that's out of the way, this product claims to be: made with clean hemisqualane, silicone-free, sulfate free, color-safe, and vegan. I believe all those claims to be true because I've never had a hair product thoroughly impress and amaze me thus faru2026 I use this product on freshly shampooed/conditioned hair that's been somewhat towel dried; I've used it alone and with other high end productsu2026 Bottom line, this product has transformed my normally frizzy, somewhat wavy hair to a curly frizz-free dream. I've never had a hair product just wow me like this, it leaves my hair literally flawless, curly, shiny, healthy, everything I could want in one singular product. I will say, I follow up with hair spray, but otherwise, this product alone has transformed my hair and the first day I used it I got so many compliments from my coworkers about my hair. Go out and buy it at Sephora because if you're not amazed, they have a great return policy. Which, I doubt will be the case, but I can't say enough great things about this air dry cream. It's a miracle product for people with in between hair and will ultimately get your hair right. A little goes a long way and at this price point, it's worth every penny. Thanks JVN, this product is one of my holy grails! ud83eudef6ud83cudffb"

It soon became quite frizzy, hoping it was just the weather I switched back to my jojoba oil spray halfway through the day. At my next wash when I didn't use the product my hair didn't go through the frizz. I tried once more on the third wash, this time doing a deep condition before exiting the shower. Once again my hair became frizzy after using the cream. While I still liked using it right after shower the frizz my hair went through later in the day was not worth it. It could very well be my hair type and having color treated hair, so I would still recommend this product for others to try."

You don't need much to cover your entire hair, and a little goes a long way. My hair type is 2a. When I'm not styling my hair, I like to let it air dry to give it a rest from all the heat tools. My hair would look frizzy and dry if I'm air drying my hair. With this cream, my hair looks more organized, not crazy and frizzy. It looks shiny and hydrated but not weighed down. The only thing I don't like is the metal tube. It's hard to get the product when it's almost out. Other than that, I'm pretty happy with the result I'm getting. It's worth trying the product if you frequently air-dry your hair but still want to style your hair just by combing your hair."

I used it on my damp hair and let it air dry, and it definitely made my curls more defined. Usually when I air dry my hair and put it half back with a clip, my hair will dry more wavy.

I always air dry my hair (unless I have an event to go, then I have to heat style). I usually shower at night and just apply hair oil on my ends but I find that I wake up with my hair still damp. Believe me when I say this cream is a game changer! JVN's Air Dry Cream definitely cuts down on drying time. It has brought back my natural texture and enhanced the waves I had lost due to constant chemical processing/dying/heat styling in the past. The scent is divine and very luxe, fresh and pretty - it's not too strong but definitely lingers. The JVN Air Dry cream makes my hair so incredibly soft and shiny. My hair is shoulder length and thin but I have lots of hair and I don't need much more than a nickel sized amount of product to spread from root to ends. It detangles and feels like a protective glove. It gives a bit of body and prevents a whole lot of frizz from happening. It never makes my hair greasy and doesn't leave a waxy residue. I am in LOVE!"

I received the Air Dry Cream and the Blow Out Styling Milk this review pertains to the JVN Air Dry Cream  hair type - heavy, wavy, thick, black, staticky   PROS -   - wow first application, noticed the difference.  - small amount is enough for my entire ton of hair - it smells AMAZING - musk and floral scent - once dry, my hair was wavy and static free!!!  - shinnier hair - easier to style - does not lead to greasy hair, just make sure to apply from crown to roots - OH and i did try it on dry hair and it did not leave it greasy!!!  CONS  -the cream comes in a those metal tubes and i truly HATED that as those tend to tear and are harder to get the last of the product left.  regardless, that is something im willing to overlook, I LOVED IT."

The air dry cream leaves my curls soft and really tamed the frizziness a lot. If you use the cream the way you are actually supposed to for curly hair ignoring the direction completely then it works great. What I mean by using it the right way is applying the product to your sopping wet hair right before exiting the shower. This is the correct way to apply curly products to curly hair. If you follow the directions then you end up with a floofy frizzy mess that looks greasy and dirty. If used correctly your curls and waves look hydrated and soft. This cream goes a long way and too much will weigh down your curls so find the right amount for you. I have not tried to diffuse with my hair at all with this as I try not to use heat when wearing my hair natural.  For the blow out milk I have only really used this a handful of times as I don't dry my hair often. The days I did blow dry my hair though, I applied the milk after squeezing most the water out of my hair. Then I blue dried my hair in sections with my large barrel brush. This left my hair feeling smooth and shiny without the weight. I also used a tiny bit on my hands for any flyaways. The packaging is nice as well. The air dry cream comes in an aluminum tube and cardboard box. They say recyclable.  The milk comes in a nice glass bottle and cardboard box. They are reasonably affordable as a treat. They are both under $28 and actually on sale right now for $20. They are above my normal budget but they would make a nice every now and then pamper product. The thing I love the most about the products is that they are a cruelty free brand and I would feel comfortable purchasing after they are gone.  All in all I would recommend if you are looking for something new."

I apply it to my wet hair and just let it be. When I put this on my hair and then blow dry it, I have much better results. My hair has more shine and it's smoother. However, I tend to not have time for the whole hair routine so air dry it is. The smell is pretty light, but I don't think it smells very good.

I had my son try this cream because he has shorter and curlier hair than I do. I also like the way my hair turns out when using a diffuser and thr hair dryer with this cream. While this cream doesn't  deliver a big shine or feel greasy, it is buildable and is made with clean hemisqualine, is silicone free,sulfate free, is colors safe, and is vegan. It keeps his curls in tact and is light weight. If you like a scented product, then you may like the scent of this cream. The scent smells so nice and is a very fresh and clean scent. I would recommend this cream to anyone who has 2 b or 3 b hair. I don't really know how other  hair textures compare."

One of the cons is that I feel like it makes my hair less wavy and more straight, so I end up with in between straight and wavy hair. But, maybe I just need to find something else to use in combination with it. All in all, I would say it's a pretty good product!"

It doesn't leave a waxy film or make your hair feel dry. Just soft to the touch, yet a defined every day look that's perfect for curly or wavy hair. Even on straight hair this would work well to cut down on the frizz and fly aways for an easy wash, go and out the door. The scent is nice and clean, which I adore. This product lasts in my hair untill my next wash, which is about every 2-3 days. I really love that this isn't made with silicones, which just coat the hair."

I wouldn't recommend for straight hair clients as a shine or moisture cream since it seems to enhance curls better. I am a hairstylist and I have used this on clients. The ones with fine hair I used it as a conditioner and did a quick rinse so it didn't make their hair too heavy and it still gave their curls a nice hold! A little goes a long way with this. The smell is nice and can be used for male or females. The price to me seems extreme reasonable compared to similar products. I would recommend this to curly hair people and would purchase it again."

First of all, the smell is really lovely but does not linger for too long after use which is nice. The texture of the cream is thick and leaves a slight tacky texture to skin and hair after use; the latter of course being completely beneficial to maintain one's natural hair texture. Upon my initial use of it, I noticed a drastic reduction in frizz and my hair was a lot softer however my hair was a little more flat compared to usual. This is very likely due to user error though.

This product definitely helped cut down on drying time. I felt like it left my hair slightly tacky making it hard to straighten. It did seem to help smooth the ends of my hair after styling. My husband who air dries his hair daily used a little and was pleased with the results. It helped dry his hair faster and give it a nice textured style versus air drying alone. I also enjoyed the smell of the product. It was nice and fresh but not overwhelming."

Let me tell you I do not know how I survived without these products. They changed my whole life (and here I thought that was coffee that did that.) In just 2 short weeks my hair completely transformed from a frizzy mess to sleek, shine, volume, AND my curls even loved the products. I will definitely add that a little bit goes a long ways, and they work with any hair type that I myself personally tried. Both products are extremely lightweight, versatile, and too top it off keep my hair balanced. Originated with clean ingredients and an interesting blend in the formula such as:                                       Airdry creme: (not heat activated)     HEMISQUALANE-Improves hair health and strength instantly and over time. Smoothes, strengthens, protects color and reduces damage. CHIA SEED AND LINSEED EXTRACT- Natural texture enhancer that lends touchable hold MORINGA SEED OIL- Adds softness, shine and luster.                                                 Combine all of this together and JVN created a lightly scented product, and the results last! I simply cannot go a single day without these babies in my routine.  Go for it! You won't regret it!  #JVNHair #JVNGifted #complimentary"

The verdict is out.. it's not too good to be true! I didn't use ANY other products with this and my hair dried perfectly!  Zero frizz, didn't feel weighed down, wasn't sticky, and my hair seemed to have more healthy looking wavy curls. I decided to try it with my gel and it still worked perfectly!  Soo the hype is true and I will forever be a customer. Finally a hair product that is the real deal!!"

All that being said, I don't know if it's something I'd use regularly as it's a little on the expensive side and more of a nice-to-have item at least for me.

If JVN offered a styler with more hold I would love it to work in combination to the cream which I found very hydrating and reduced frizz."

This air dry cream from JVN has really helped my hair look smoother, shinier, and healthier in general without weighing it down as most styling products do. The cream is light, not greasey, and smells FANTASTIC!   It is a clean, feminine, but not too strong scent. The scent is my favorite thing about this product, it lingers all day and can still be smelled 12+ hours after applying. I really like this product and recommend it to everyone that prefers air drying over blowouts. Your hair will thank you!  I'm amazed by the amount of people giving poor reviews just because they normally blow dry. This is literally for air drying. If your hair is a mess without blow drying, this product is not for you."

This product is geared towards people who air dry their hair, which I do not do. I did try using this product and let my hair air dry, but had not great results. My hair was very fuzzy, it worked against my waves, and I felt like I needed to use a ton to control the end results. I used this product on wet hair and styled my hair with a round brush like I usually do and also had odd results. It made my hair feel thick and unmanageable. The more i kept trying to smooth out my hair with the round brush, the tougher it became. It was almost difficult to run my fingers through after this method. I couldn't wait to wash it out. The final way I used this was as a finishing cream after my usual styling. It was fine, but didnt impress me enough to have me reach for this over my usual products. It's great that you get so much product and the price is very reasonable, but this is just not fot me. The scent reminds me of biolage products and has an earthiness to it. Overall this is very underwhelming for me. I think for someone who does not heavily process their hair and styles their hair by air drying it, this would be way more successful. This is a big no for me."

I am a hairstylist who uses a lot of great products everyday and I love to air dry my own hair cause it's super wavy and dries nicely with the right kind of air dry product or texture spray. I had no expectations because I had never heard anything about the brand, the packaging is really modern and nice and the air dry cream is packaged in a similar way to a tube of hair color just much bigger, It's a good size tube of product and you truly don't need a lot of product at all it's concentrated. I am a tough critic and I don't judge lightly when it comes to hair products, and instantly I could tell this was a great product that was well formulated and had an intentional styling purpose, from this day forward this is my holy grail product for my hair, it did everything I wanted it to do and more. I have coarse hair, very dry looking when I blow dry, my mother says it looks like hay which I get offended about but it truly does, it's just super thick and coarse and has always felt dehydrated. Typically when I air dry I do my hair soaking wet, and apply a ton of different products for different reasons, one to hydrate, one to defrizz, one for control and one for enhancing my wave pattern. This product is genius, I don't know if any other product I have ever tried on myself that has suited my hair type so perfectly. My hair dried without frizz, and it gave me beautiful texture and perfectly beachy waves without feeling like I had anything in my hair at all. it left my hair feeling soft and hydrated and also with a great style and volume at the roots. I'm so impressed and I'm so intrigued to learn about the rest of this line and use it on my clients. This is the best for hair like mine, I love it. Who doesn't want beautiful waves and low maintenance styling without any heat damage? Try it"

The scent of this is subtle but reminds me of products typically used in a salon and has that salon scent to it in a good way. It's not overpowering and doesn't irritate me at all. I also love that the cream is a true cream, it is not too watery nor is it too sticky it has a wonderful consistency that makes applying it very easy without leaving a ton of residue on your hands afterwards. I have 3b/3C hair and I think that this is a good back-up product to my current system but at times I feel like if I layer it, it leaves too much residue and I don't like when it dries but I do use this at times when I know I will be applying heat in the future just so there is some moisture / primer on my hair at all times. There are times where I feel like my hair kind of soaks this product up to the point where it can get brittle so I have to be conscious about rotating my moisture / protein products but I think that's mostly due to my hair type and texture and not to do with the product. I would absolutely purchase this again and think it's a good product to have in my normal curly hair routine rotation."

Sort of like what I wish dry shampoo could do for me, but never does because it always just dries out my roots and makes my hair feel gross. The Air Dry Creme also helps me steer clear of over-washing my hair, which, knowing JVN from Queer Eye, I know was probably important to them! I also appreciate the fact that the bottle is not made of plastic and the ingredients are clean. Would recommend 100%!"

You really only need a tiny bit of it (too much makes it feel dry) and it works best over some kind of leave in conditioner spray and then under a little of the Recovery Serum to help soften and smooth your ends. This cream helps give texture and emphasize what you already have but it's not going to give slip so you need to use something for that as well if you have dry hair.  I do really love it after I understood the best way to use it. it makes my natural texture look so good, my hair has volume and light hold/pliability and it always dries really nice"

I have long, wavy hair, but it's fine to medium in texture; my wave never usually lasts, and styling products typically weigh it down. Not this one! My waves last for at least a couple days and I can simply reactivate the product by spritzing with a bit of water and scrunching. I tend to get oily at the roots rather quickly, and drier near the middle to ends; but I can go longer without shampooing or using dry shampoo, and my ends feel SO SOFT. The overall condition of my hair has improved, as well. Has a light, clean, earthy scent with a bit of hold. Not sticky or crunchy at all. I love that it is vegan and ultra hydrating without being overly thick or greasy. Less is more to start out with, as it is completely buildable. The first selfie is with only the cream; the second is with the cream and having my hair in a claw clip for 2 hrs. I have received multiple compliments on my hair since incorporating this into my routine. I am completely sold on this and want to try more JVN products. Would absolutely recommend."

It left my hair soft, shiny, smooth (I'm also a frizz ball), and it smells beautiful. Not heavily perfumed, but a nice clean scent that smells so good. It's currently monsoon season where I live, so it's been extremely humid, and this product still helped keep my frizziness at bay, while leaving my hair feeling lightweight. I also love that this is a clean hair product that also protects from UV damage. I live in an extremely sunny climate when it isn't monsoon season, and any added UV protection is important. The ingredients include hemi-squalane, moringa seed oil, chia seed extract, which all help to smooth, soften, and add shine to your hair, and they work! I've been trying to use less chemicals when it comes to my hair care, so I was happy to have found a new air dry cream that does what it claims to do. I also like that the packaging is recyclable. I highly recommend this product, especially since I feel it's quite reasonably priced, has some great clean ingredients, and helps keep my poof ball hair, smooth, shiny and defined without weighing it down."

Currently I am using a pastel purple color treated human-hair wig so relying on hair products can be confusing. A lot of the time when I wash it, after leaving it to air dry the amount of frizz is extremely out of control. This helps to tame that, preventing much of the poof I end up with. I tried this after air drying and again using a blow dryer on medium heat. This helps to prevent heat damage which is what I think helped so much with the frizz or split ends. I really was happy with this also because it is color-safe and vegan. Both products are so easy to use and don't feel greasy or heavy and both smell amazing! I like how this is not messy, feels lightweight and easy to just rub through the hair strands. This has the hemisqualane ingredient in it which is supposed to play a big factor in frizz, smoothing and recovery or breakage. This had my wig smelling so good and feeling so soft. The packaging is a squeezable tube that's easy to get out with a top. I really like that this is recyclable also!"

My hair ultimately felt dry, heavy, and just dirty in general.  Right in the trash it went, along with his other products.  No incentive here, bought with my own money, and I dislike it immensely.  Still on the look out for the best product, until then cheaper drugstore options are the best for me."

I found this applies best on damp, but not wet hair, and almost scrunched in. It didn't make my hair feel crunchy or greasy, but also didn't give as much shine or hold as I was hoping either. I layered it with my detangler and shine oil and it didn't weigh my hair down any more than normal! It doesn't have an overpowering smell to me and the tube is massive for the price. Definitely a good steal, might just have to play around with it more to find what works."

You're probably asking yourself, u201cwhy is this person spending so much time explaining the scent?u201d Reason being, so often people while using hair products associate smell with the quality of the product.

It also doesn't flake, which was important to me.  It's also huge so you get a ton of the product and it's reasonably priced and sustainable, which usually is hard to find. The packaging is in this metal tube, which makes it easy to squeeze out. It's not very travel friendly because it's a bit heavy, but it's perfect for your counter because of the minimalistic design.

I struggle to find products that smooth my frizz so my curls can pop, without weighing down my hair - I can't stand the feeling of anything sticky or hard, because I like to be able to touch my hair & restyle it without it becoming a sticky mess.   These are AMAZING. Like, jaw-dropping, kiss the tube, talk-into-the-mirror amazing!! So lightweight, so smoothing, & basically invisible in the hair. AND, my wash days last longer because they leave no residue, are easy to restyle with just water, & keep frizz down for days! The secret is Hemisqualane, a non-silicone smoother & hydrator. And the smell is DIVINE!!  The Air Dry cream is fantastic on its own & has become my go-to one-&-done styler. The Serum is even more hydrating, for an extra layer of smoothing & heat protection - I layer it under the Air Dry Cream if I'm planning to diffuse. For even more definition & hold, you can add a light gel over top but it's not necessary. My curls stay for days, refresh with just water, & look wayyyyy better than with anything else I've tried. They're even better with the shampoo, conditioner, & conditioning mist (purchased myself)."

I've never had waves unintentionally before. So the next wash I went in with intention: I used more product, I scrunched the heck out of my hair, and I waited. Thoroughly impressed by the results. My hair looks like I spent a lot of time trying to make beachy waves. I sat on my butt and ate chips. Incredible. This is definitely a product I'm going to keep working with."

When I used the hydrating air cream, I used as after wash day before a twist out. The cream was a little watery than I'm use to but the smell was pleasant. I used a diffuser to dry my hair and it seemed to dry quicker than normal to me. I would recommend using this while your hair is more than 30% damp to achieve better results if you have natural tight curly hair."

Today was my first time using these 3 products and I already love them. First the shampoo, the consistency was a tad runny but had a nice slippery feel to it. I like the scent ( smells like natural essential oils ) and I like how much it lathers and spreads you only need one pump. Secondly the conditioner, it smelled a little weird (like old lady perfume in an essential oil way, wasn't too bad tho). The consistency was a good medium not too thin nor thick, it didn't weigh down my fine curly hair at all and felt like a good hydrating conditioner as I rinsed it out. When you are about to use the shampoo and conditioner bottles for the first time some reviews said the pumps didn't work or are hard to get started but the trick to it is to hold the smaller ring on the pump in place while you are turning the handle and it'll pop up no problem. The Air Dry cream had very light hold and helped my curls form beautifully and it had a fine smell to it. My curls felt soft after they dried completely. The samples that come from the JVN website are SUPER small so don't get excited just buy the full size air dry cream if you want to try it, the full size of the moisture mask is bigger than I expected and I'm excited to try it at the end of this week."

The packaging feels luxurious, the product smells expensive but the scent doesn't linger, and the formula is light weight and leaves my hair frizz free and hydrated. It doesn't leave a residue or producty feeling in my hair.

While I love the JVN cashmere and amber scent with citrus notes, I don't think this cream offered enough texture and hold control compared to other hair texturing and styling products in this same category. While it does manage to add a slight texture and shine, it really falls short regarding holding or styling, especially on shorter styles that need a lot more hold control to keep hair in place. It's such a shame, as this product is gender neutral and would otherwise work well for both men and women."

As a nurse of nearly 25 years, I'm used to washing my hair at night and putting it in a bun to get it out of the way on any given day. I was hoping this would help with the frizziness and keep my hair smooth. It sure did! It had a very light refreshing scent which didn't trigger my migraines-always a plus! I didn't know how much to use and maybe ended up with about a quarter to half dollar amount to get most of my hair minus my scalp. My hair really took to this cream and it helped accentuate the curly without being crunchy. It's slightly stiffer than my normal hair but feels natural when I run my fingers through my hair and not like it was full of product. The only thing I wish would be changed is to have it in a pump form rather than having to squeeze it out of a tube. I can see the product not being able to be stored vertically once I am running low on product. Other than that, I love this product and saved the name to purchase after I am done with this tube. I totally recommend it for anyone who wants a light feeling but effective air dry hair cream."

My son was even able to use the products and guys hair care selection is lacking at best at stores. The scent is amazing and not overly perfumed providing a clean hair smell.    The air dry cream was applied to wet hair and didn't take much, it applied a soft yet textured feel on the morning with all day frizz relief.    The instant recovery serum used somewhat similar, small amount on wet hair but I diffused my hair (ponytail shot). It left my hair shiny and soft all day long, only downfall was it did not hold up well to humidity so a mixture of the two is the perfect combo.  Both containers are a large size and will last a long time !! Woohoo for good natural hair days without heat damage."

Especially after having a baby, so much of my hair has broken and is now starting to regrow giving me this funky frizz. JVN air styling cream is amazing. First, it has such a fresh clean scent so I don't mind using it in my hair. I actually enjoy the sweet fruity smell. On top of that, I love that the product not only helps to control and reduce frizz. I can use it to style as well. This way I don't need multiple products in my hair weighing it down. It also gives a smoothing effect to my hair. I have body waves and it doesn't make them automatically straight or turn them into a frizzy curl. It gives body to my hair while styling it in a way that would normally take me at least two products and a lot of time. I blow dry my hair and air dry my hair but I'd say I leave it to air dry 65% of the time so this is a product I can use almost every time I wash my hair. I enjoyed using the product and I like it more each time I use it."

It seems too add some shine, smooths strands, and overall helps give my hair a more polished look. I usually do air dry my hair, so I'm always looking for products to help. Lately I've been putting hyaluronic acid into my wet hair as a first step, then a cream product once it has dried just a bit. The combination has been helping my hair have more hydration and healthy shine! The JVN cream has also been working well to hold in smooth waves. When I have the time, I will wait for my hair to be just damp, and then apply cream and twist it into little buns with alligator clips. After 30-60 minutes I take the clips out and gently run a wide-toothed comb through my hair. The JVN cream helps reduce frizz when I comb out, without weighing down the waves!"

I do notice more shine but frizz control was a no. I tried letting my hair air dry with it in but it made it a little crunchy but I could brush through it. Now this is amazing for wet slick pony tails or getting your hair close and tight to your head. Using with a regular hair dryer I noticed some volume but left a weird texture like feeling as if I used dry shampoo.  When I used my brush dryer, it did give me a ver sleek blow out. I have string straight very thick hair. I believe this would work better in fine or curly textures."

After straightening it with a flat iron my hair was softer.  The packages are made of metal which is better for the environment.

I can achieve a smoother texture all over my hair and despite having fine/thin hair, this product does not weigh it down at all. I also love the grapefruit and tangerine scent it carries as it is light yet citrus which again ties in so well with the summer season.  To top it off this product is cruelty-free, vegan, color-safe, sulfate free, silicone-free, and made with clean hemisqualane. I really appreciate that it is also packaged with a recyclable aluminum tube so I can feel better about using a more sustainable based product. Overall, I am in love with the JVN brand and am excited to try even more products in the future!"

Comb through and let air dry.   If I have time in the day, I make two pig tails, no bands, just coil them tight with my finger and clip. Then just let dry.  It leaves such nice waves to my hair.  If there's not much time, I just let the hair down and air dry.  I've also used my curling iron brush and hair sets so beautifully.  No crunchy hair, just soft manageable hair without the frizz or dryer up look.  Leaves hair looking healthy.  It has a soft unisex scent.  It won't clash with any perfumes you're wearing.

However, the cream left my hair looking dull and didn't take away the frizz. The feel of my hair was also off-putting. Although it did not make my hair feel crunchy it did make it feel dirty."

I have very thick hair wavy to curly hair and air drying is just a pain. It takes hours. But I gave it a shot with this. I think with hair less prone to frizz or in an environment that isn't as humid as where I live, it would be a phenomenal product that would help hold waves and curls but for me I still find myself having to hear style. Even then it does make my hair feel and look more hydrated, so it's still a win just not exactly what I was hoping for. Still recommend giving it a shot though!"

If anything, my hair looks better when I use nothing at all compared to using this."
