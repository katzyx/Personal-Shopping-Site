It makes the difference in camouflaging my dark circles that no concealer can do by itself. Here's the KEY:  Use the tiniest amount, warmed between the fingertips of your ring fingers, then gently pat into your dark circles.  If it's creasing, you used too much, so pat some off.  The miniscule amount needed makes the little jar last a really long time!"

The second thing I noticed since it is a very  creamy product was how bad it creases. this is with and without adding an additional concealer under my eyes. there are times I can get it looking nice all day if I do additional steps. since getting consistently warmer out i am not too sure how it will hold as the last time I wore it for an outdoor event the creasing was crazy. I usually do not have this issue with concealer.  I will say it does look beautiful on with concealer over it."

It's more for brightening if you have mild dark circles.  - No shade works for me as a one-and-done concealer. I have light-medium warm skin tone and the lightest is too pink/light while the medium is too dark/orange.   Since I have the medium shade that's too dark for me, I might keep it as a color corrector to use under another concealer when I'm doing a full face of makeup. But I was looking for something to use on no-makeup days when I just want to put on a bit and go, and this wasn't it for me."

Here's the long version: I've battled dark undereye circles since my teenage years, and now at 33, they're still going strong. Add in my oily skin, and I'm on a never-ending quest to find something that really works. This product caught my eye after endless Googling and YouTube deep-dives into makeup reviews. After almost using up the whole thing, here's my take: It's a color corrector, so yeah, it's pretty orange. But hey, my circles needed that color correction. Works okay by itself, but it's a real winner under a concealer (I go for the bareMinerals powder one). It's not the longest-lasting solo act, but it's my go-to for low-effort work-from-home days when I just need a quick fix. And that wetness? Yeah, it's a bit of a pain, but it's also why this stuff doesn't crease like crazy. It's hands-down the best dark circle solution I've found, but that fifth star? Still waiting on the standalone holy grail."

When applying, it did appear to brighten the area and had light colour correction but it was very thick, sticky and oily. I found it would crease badly. And when I tried to put a bit of powder it was very patchy and made my under eyes look crinkly. Powder also impacted the brightening as I think a lot of the brightening is just from the light reflecting off the greasy shine it leaves. I tried it a few days and itu2019s just not for me.

For me, it just didn't work. Not think enough to work as a concealer on it's ow, and alone just make me look kind of sparkly and way too white. But I also couldn't get it to work with concealer, either over or under. I think my under eye area is just too large for something like this. I've had much better luck with Pixi Correction and Bye Bye Undereye. I tried both the Fair/Light and Medium. Neither worked for me; I ended up returning both.

I've started seeing it a lot lately again and so many reviews were raving about it so I decided to take a chance and try it again. This time, I love it. I might have been using it wrong before, but I have not had any creasing issues and it helps so much to brighten the under eye area, making me use less concealer and other products. I don't have very dark under eyes to begin with but it's somehow still hard to cover it completely with concealer. I also have extremely dry skin and have been trying to add extra moisturizer to my under eye area this winter and this works well with all of my products. This product does not seem to dry my skin out, doesn't crease (but I use the smallest amount possible, just barely dipping my finger in, not piling the product on), and brightens well. The only thing I don't love is that it's kind of sticky and feels a bit dry and not moisturizing for a cream formula, so that's why I use very small amounts, but it's more than enough to get the job done. I top it off with Nars Creamy concealer and a tiny dab of Laura Mercier setting powder and it's perfect."

This is in my top five absolutely must have products for my daily routine. I am a very fair skinned neutral tone that leans a bit cool (I can see blue and green on the underside of my wrist) and I have always had vivid large purple-ish blue tones in my tear trough area.  Nothing else on the market will work like the Becca (now Smashbox) corrector does.    I bought the lightest Charlotte Tilbury color corrector in fair just to see if it was better and I can confidently say it is not! The Charlotte Tilbury packaging is more luxurious but it is also more matte and less brightening plus I feel like I'm paying a premium for the compact with the mirror on it.  I do my color correcting as part of my morning makeup routine and have never utilized the mirror during that time so the mirror is just an unnecessary expense.  Becca/Smashbox definitely got their packaging for this product perfect- you get more product and it's in a simple but cute glass jar.   If you are fair to light skinned and cursed with purple blue under eyes like me the Becca/ Smashbox is the best product I have ever found for this.   I will be absolutely gutted if this ever goes off the market. It is 100% worth it!"

The tacky consistency allows the other product to lay nicely on top of it without moving either. Esp if you give it a minute to set before layering.  And that was my problem previous to finding this. I could find the color corrector but it would always disappear as soon i put something on top. So glad to have the fix to that issue with this product. I will be buying this again for sure."

The only thing I would say is a big misleading are the shades/swatch photos because they appear a lot darker than they do in real life. I'm roughly an NC42/44 and I found the shade medium/dark to be too light for me to cover my undereye hyperpigmentation and my dark circles aren't even THAT dark. So I found the Dark shade works better in covering my undereyes and hyperpigmentation around my mouth (the dark shade is about 2-3 shades darker than my complexion). It might be a personal preference thing too. I would suggest swatching the shades in store if possible to determine what will work for you."

It blends nicely on top of the eye cream and then you can place your concealer over the top of the color corrector. I am 55 years old and I was truly amazed at the difference it made. I added just a touch of the Laura Mercier brightening power over the top and it set everything in place and did not crease. This color corrector can also be used on other parts of your face- covering red spots or blemishes. I love it!"

I have medium olive skin and this shade was perfect. I feel like it had a small u201csalmonu201d tint to it which is great for correcting dark under eyes. I used it alone and with concealer on top of it and you can definitely see a difference. Cons: it is THICK and you have to apply it with your ring finger or a brush and I just feel like you can see streaks since the consistency is so thick and almost some what greasy. If youu2019re under eye creases a lot you may want to consider a lighter more self setting formula. Other than that, it does itu2019s job!

At first I thought the color would be too deep (I have the shade u201cmediumu201d) but I think I was just confused by the fact that it was orange, because it actually does a great job cancelling out some of the dark purple in my under eye circles. It says itu2019s full coverage, but I find it to be more medium/buildable, which I prefer anyways. It feels nice and creamy to the touch, but Iu2019ve found you need to put it on immediately after an eye cream, and then quickly put concealer on top of that, in order for it to not get cakey-looking. And it does look nice at first, but I havenu2019t figured out how to make it not crease.. which is a big bummer, but that could be user error. Also, it says itu2019s u201cilluminatingu201d and u201clight reflectingu201d which usually means u201csparklyu201d, but I donu2019t notice any sparkle or shimmer, just a nice radiant finish.

Using this corrector in very specific spots neutralizes the darkness so it's undetectable. Then if I place concealer on top, set with a light amount of powder my dark circles are completely invisible! I highly recommend this to anyone who struggles like I do. It also feels moisturizing, but not greasy, and very lightweight. No discernable fragrance, and doesn't irritate my sensitive skin. For reference, I have medium to tan (range) skin with warm olive undertones and I use shade Medium.  I took one star off because it doesn't self-set so it absolutely requires powder if you plan to wear it on it's own. It's still Spring in FL right noe, so I can't comment on the sweat-resistance."
