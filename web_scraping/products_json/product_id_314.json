Im genuinely confused by the negative reviewsu2014 I dont know how it could make your hair dry. I have blonde, long, thick, curly, highlighted hair that I have been at war with to keep straight for basically my whole life. While I have a lot of hair, my actual strands are fine which can be difficult at timesu2014 especially when it comes to keeping it long. This oil doesnt leave a residue like most, soaks into my hair, and make it smooth and shiny. I have been using about a week since getting it highlighted and I can tell the quality of my hair is improving based on moisture level alone. I would definitely say this is worth giving a shot, it has impressed me and I have a pretty big product graveyard."

Its been two months since Ive been using it, I have so much remaining, and I no longer need to use it every day. I can use it every 3-4 days!

I use it straight out of the shower, on dry ends before bed to soak overnight and again daily for styling and shine (hence why I am flying through bottles). I need to start purchasing in multiples so I always have some on hand - I even use a mini sample bottle I got and refill as needed for travel, I cannot be without it.
