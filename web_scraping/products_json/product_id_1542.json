The Serum made me break out and feel greasy, and the moisturizer is pretty meh. Overall, for the price point, I found these products disappointing."

            "review_text": "I received this sample kit with one of my normal purchases from Sephora. I don't normally switch my skincare routine, but the reviews looked great, so I figured I would give it a shot. The first 2 days I used it, I was pleasantly surprised, as my skin looked great and was glowing. The 3rd day, I woke up to a weird sore above my lip. Was not a pimple, it almost looked like a scab. Throughout the day, I noticed 2 more by my ear...then my forehead...and by day 4, my entire face was covered in open sores. My skin does not break out, even after using new products, and if I do get the occasional pimple, it's gone within a day. This was a full blown bacterial infection. After going to the doctor and getting prescribed an oral antibiotic and a topical cream because they determined it was from this new skincare, a week later I am still having new sores pop up and now have to go to my local dermatologist for laser treatments, as I am afraid these will scar. I don't know if the sample packs were contaminated, but this was the WORST experience I have had with a new skincare, and now am having to spend money on doctors, medicine, and possible future treatments because of the facial infection it caused. Just beware to do a test spot before you use all over your face in case you have a reaction similar to mine. So disappointed and embarrassed by my skin right now."

The second part of my double cleanse is the gentle cleansing foam, which lathers up lightly and makes my face feel clean but not stripped of moisture.  I then go in with the first care activating serum, which has a thin, liquid consistency and gives my skin an immediate boost of radiance.  I end with the concentrated ginseng renewing cream, which I would consider more of a gel cream, and it leaves my skin feeling soft, smooth, and nourished without feeling heavy or greasy.  These products have natural scents that are a blend of their floral and herbal ingredients.  When used all together, this set makes my skin look hydrated and dewy."

            "review_text": "If you're new to Sulwhassoo skincare and want to try it out without breaking the bank, the Sulwhassoo First Care Trial Kit is a great option. This kit provides a broad range of products that allow you to test and experience the brand's quality. The set includes a uniquely sized 30 ml bottle of the First Care Activating Serum, exclusively available in this kit. The serum in this kit is very light and quickly absorbs into the skin, giving it a soft glow without any texture or tackiness. When initially applied, there is a floral scent, but it quickly fades and isn't overwhelming.  The cleansing oil is my second favorite product in this kit, as it not only effortlessly removes makeup but also makes my skin feel incredibly soft afterwards. There is a decent herbal scent when working it in, but it's not too strong. The Cleansing Foam also works great at providing a thorough cleanse, whether or not you're wearing makeup. The citrusy herbal scent of this product is the most intense when compared to all four in the kit.  My favorite product, hands down, is the Renewing Cream. It has a rich, creamy texture and applies like a hydration dream, making my skin feel silky soft without being too much for my combination skin. The scent is the most unique since it smells earthy, with a little tinge of unpleasantness, but nothing that would stop me from using it. After a week of use, I've noticed my aging combination skin feels wonderful. Though Sulwhassoo products can be pricey, this trial kit offers great value for those looking to explore the brand."

And the First Care serum (the largest item in the set) along with the Renewing Cream both feel wonderful and luxurious on the skin, with a lovely herbal scent thatu2019s not at all perfume-y.

It does take a little while for the products to fully absorb, but as long as you're patient and aware, it shouldn't be a concern. My fine lines have shown improvement, but I'm still undecided about their impact on my pores.

It includes both a cleansing oil and cleansing foam that work well together to leave skin feeling clean. My favorite product is probably the serum, which is thin (but not watery) and absorbs easily into the skin, leaving it feel immediately softer and hydrated. It also has a very pleasant elegant fragrance that seems somewhat citrusy and floral. The ginseng cream sample is quite small, but itu2019s enough to try it for long enough to get a sense of the product. I like it, but it is on the heavier side for me. As a result, I only use it in the evening or if my skin is feeling especially dry. With my daytime routine, it feels a little too heavy to wear under my makeup though. It is very moisturizing, and even the small sample packaging is attractive. The fragrance is on the strong side, but I personally like the herbally ginseng scent that it has. A great kit to try out Sulwhasoo products!"

The cleansing foam is more like a traditional cleanser and it lathers up well and left my face feeling clean and smooth. The activating serum absorbed and dried quickly and felt very lightweight on my skin and hydrating too. The cleansers and the serum all smelled fantastic too, they have a light citrus fragrance to them. I didnu2019t notice a difference in how my skin looked overall after using the renewing cream.

The First Care Activating Serum has a ginseng scent, and the texture is lightweight glycerin gel. It dried down a little tacky but that helped in layering the Concentrated Ginseng Renewing Cream. The cream is a great sealant to lock in the other product and provided hydration and plumping that I could feel and see the next morning.

I have used the brandu2019s First Care Activating Serum (the largest of the samples in this kit) in the past, and with consistent use have seen improvement to my skin barrier, better hydration, and softer skin. The kitu2019s hero ingredient is the Sulwhasoo Master Complex, which is a combination of herbal ingredients and ginseng that supports skin health. Also highlighted is Ginsenomics, which is an active concentration of ginseng saponin that is claimed to improve the look of wrinkles. This Set includes the following: - 1 oz/ 30 mL First Care Activating Serum (see above) - 0.84 oz/ 25 mL Gentle Cleansing Oil: a deep cleansing oil that is just the right weight and feels luxurious on the skin. - 0.84 oz/ 25 mL Gentle Cleansing Foam a second-step or solo cleanser that is gentle and brightening. - 0.16 oz/ 5 mL Concentrated Ginseng Renewing Cream is an anti-aging cream that feels silky smooth and absorbs fabulously into the skin.

The oil is very helpful in removing makeup, except for on the eyes. Avoid using it on the eyes because it really really stings.  The cleansing foam is the second part of the double cleansing and remove all residual dirt and makeup. I use it without the oil sometimes and it does a really good job even by itself. My skin feels clean and it doesnu2019t dry it. I apply the serum next. It isnu2019t too thick, nor too thin but blends well in my skin and gives it a smooth hydrated feel which Iu2019m really getting used to. The ginseng cream is the last one. It comes in a small bottle but a little goes a long way so you donu2019t have to apply too much. It doesnu2019t feel thick and heavy on my skin so I like applying it just as much as the serum. My skin feels refreshed and taken care of with these products and I enjoy using them specially knowing that they donu2019t have the products that are generally known to be unhealthy for my skin.  All in all, itu2019s a good set that gives you a chance to try out their hit products and letu2019s you choose which ones you want to buy again and if they suit your skin at all.

Iu2019ve only been using the product for about a week, so I canu2019t really speak to result from long term use, but so far all the products seem to be working well!   The only down side is that most of the included products are pretty pricy in their full version so I donu2019t necessarily see myself purchasing the individual products once I run out of the trial kit."

I am also a huge fan of the Cream because of how hydrating it is for my mature skin, so I am very happy to have it back in my life.

I was surprised upon opening as for some reason, I couldn't imagine the first treatment serum would be the size it is in this kit. It's actually one fluid ounce - the same size as most western serums! I am including a picture of the size in the kit next to the full size to really illustrate the value here.  The set includes minis of the cleansing oil and cleanser, which are both perfect for double cleansing as well as a lovely sensory experience. The ginseng cream is also included in a mini (another personal favorite)  And finally, as a skincare enthusiast myself, I want to take a moment to say what I believe stands out in this brand as well as the included products. Sulwhasoo is a research-focused brand, particularly focused on ginseng. Initially, I struggled to make sense of the ingredients lists (as a Westerner focused more on our strong actives). Over time, I realized that Sulwhasoo uses TCM herbs and goes above and beyond to isolate the active constituents found in these herbs. This is the meaning of enzyme-treated ginseng saponins, for example. It's a completely different approach to skincare, and for me, one that has proven itself in terms of results. These products revealed a brighter, more even skintone for me, and I believe they will for others as well."

This set includes: - Gentle Cleansing Oil- removes waterproof makeup - Gentle Cleansing Foam - removes debris and dirt while keeping skin hydrated - First Care Activating Serum - hydrates and strengthens skin barrier. At 30ml, this serum is a fairly large size for a trial! - Concentrated Ginseng Renewal Cream - Moisturizes and firms skin The key ingredient in this set is ginseng, a powerful herbal ingredient, to help address signs of aging and improve skin barrier. Ginseng has many skincare benefits including reducing wrinkles, improving elasticity, brightening skin, reducing puffiness, encouraging collagen production. After trying this set just for a day, I can tell that I already love this line! The serum and moisturizer are standouts for me. The serum texture is liquidy, a cross between an essence water and a serum. It is very thin but more viscous than water. It glides on smooth and absorbs instantly. The moisturizer is light, smooth and silky. After applying these, my skin completely absorbs the products. My skin feels silky and unbelievably smooth. There is a strong ginseng scent in these products which creates a zen-like spa experience. So far, after using the trial set for several days, my skin is feeling smoother and firmer.

It left my skin feeling refreshed and clean without any dryness. 3. First Care Activating Serum VI: This serum is the star of the kit. It preps the skin for subsequent products, and I noticed a visible improvement in the overall texture and radiance of my skin after just a few uses. 4. Concentrated Ginseng Renewing Cream: This cream is luxurious and provides deep hydration. It made my skin feel plump and nourished, and the ginseng extract is a great anti-aging ingredient. The Sulwhasoo First Care Trial Kit offers a well-rounded skincare routine. While the products may seem on the pricier side, they're worth the investment for the noticeable improvement in skin quality. This kit is an excellent way to experience Sulwhasoo's premium products and see the benefits for yourself."

            "review_text": "I just love this Sulwhasoo trial kit.   Gentle Cleansing Oil - It lifted all that makeup, mascara, and sunscreen off my face with just a few passes of light massaging. It rinses away pretty well. It smells absolutely perfect, at least to my taste. Sulwhasoo Gentle Cleansing Foam - The texture is great u2013 liquid enough to smooth over my face without pulling at my skin. It foams up slightly, but not as much as traditional foam cleansers. After rinsing it, my skin is soft and smooth. It does not feel stripped of moisture.  Sulwhasoo Activating Serum Review - It's a Lightweight and incredibly absorbent serum. The golden elixir is lightweight and runny; it melts quickly into the skin, dries to the touch within minutes, and leaves zero residues behind. With that said, this serum softened my skin, and it definitely improved the absorption of subsequent products.  Sulwhasoo Concentrated Renewing Ginseng Cream - Unlike most creamy moisturizers, the texture of the cream isnu2019t thick. When you scoop it out, it isnu2019t solid, but a little runny and liquid. It is almost like a thicker emulsion. It feels like a cream blended with oil. I wake up the next morning with soft, moisturized skin. But I find that after a week of using this cream, day and night, my skin seems to be re-balanced. It feels softer. It feels smoother. The other thing I noticed also, is that my skin appears to be stronger. I also find that my skin does not turn red, or look as red and patchy even in our hot weather."

I do wish the renewing cream was a little larger, it is 5ml or 0.16 fluid ounces. ud83eudde1  I have seen Sulwhasoo all over the place and personally enjoy luxury skincare, so I was super excited to snag this trial kit! All four skincare products have this really beautiful, light fragrance that I really like, and all are very gentle on my skin. I have dry, maturing skin and recently had irritation from another brand I tried out. I was really happy that this Sulwhasoo First Care Trial was so gentle that it actually has soothed my skin back to normal. ud83eudde1  This trial care kit helps with Dryness, Dullness, and Loss of Firmness and Elasticity, all of which are skin concerns of mine. I am really loving how my skin is feeling, looking and smelling from adding these four products into my daily skincare routine. I would definitely love to have them all in full size and try much more from Sulwhasoo. This skincare is definitely luxury and a brand I would love to continue to use. ud83eudde1"

The Gentle Cleansing Oil is very effective in removing the makeup completely. After emulsifying it and rinsing with lukewarm water, my face felt clean. I usually would have breakout from cleansing oil, however my skin loves this and feels moisturized.  I followed up with second face cleansing using the Gentle Cleansing Foam. It has a very light scent, leaves my face feeling clean without feeling dry.   The 3rd step is using the cult-favorite First Care Activating Serum VI. I apply the serum to damp skin and pat it down. I feel itu2019s a very light, smooth serum and absorbs easily. I have not used it long enough to see if it makes any improvements to my fine lines.   Lastly, I warm the Concentrated Ginseng Renewing Cream between your fingertips and gently press into the skin. This moisturizer is rich but lightweight at the same time. I feel it is silky soft  leaving my skin smoother and healthier looking. I have not tried it long enough to see if it improves on my fine lines or skin elasticity.  Overall, I love this set as my skin feels pampered after all the steps, like I just had a spa. I would definitely repurchase this again as a gift."

Both cleansing oil and foam do a great job removing makeup and dirt without drying out the skin, the serum is incredibly lightweight and absorbs instantly, and the cream, that happens to be my favorite, is incredibly rich and nourishing. Definitely going to be gifting this set to s few people this holiday season."

I think the packaging is really cute and makes for a perfect gift (to someone else or yourself). Itu2019s nearly a full routine (just missing an eye cream). I think the value of this is pretty good considering what it comes with. I wish the concentrated ginseng renewing serum was included to go with the cream since that one is my favorite!
