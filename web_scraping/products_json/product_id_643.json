I was beyond excited to be able to try out Feelinu2019 Cheeky Clean Amplifying Blush Duo. I canu2019t tell you how excited I was to try out this new blush duo! I absolutely love blush and I love how pigmented it looks and the amazing shades they have. I love to use these shades individually for daily use but love to blend them for a good night out or special occasions. This blush glides on perfectly, buildable, itu2019s blend-able. It definitely lasts for hours and if I need a touch up through out the day it is easy to add on without looking cakey."

            "review_text": "It took me forever to settle on a color. I knew the pigment would be there and love most the colors, but I have a hard time with shades not looking right on me, or not showing up enough. I finally bought Honeymoon Phase in-store yesterday, and I will definitely buy again, as well as another shade, and hope they come out with more!  My skin is fair with surface redness, but I guess neutral-olive, and eye shadows and blushes typically look off color or pull orange on me, with red/pink/brown, and warmth especially. I look best in shades that aren't too bright, red or coral, so I decided on a purple hue, but I was afraid this HP color would be too much of a bright purple, instead of plummy I think I need. But, it is amazing - very pigmented, shows up easily without much effort or product, didn't turn orange on me, and is a beautiful, unique color. It doesn't look chalky or heavy on my dry skin. Just a light swipe of the darker color using a standard powder brush, not dense, and it shows up so well as kind of a pinky purple in bright light, and sort of medium plummy grape when in the shade, on me at least. That will obvi depend on your skin undertones to some degree. If I want brighter/less deep, I just layer the lighter color over the darker. Otherwise, I put the lighter color just above the darker, like a highlighter. Yesterday and today, it's the same color as when applied a few+ hours prior and hasn't faded, so I imagine it will last most the day.  I don't love the scent, however. It's sort of a baby powder, more powdery scent than GXVE lip products imo. But, it's not offensive per se, even with a sensitive nose, and I don't smell it after I've closed the compact. Regardless, the product is so lovable it doesn't deter me from using or buying again. Might be missing out if you don't give it a try at least to see if it works for you, especially at decent prices :)"

            "review_text": "I was so excited to try these products because I have recently found myself in love with blush. From the gold design on the compact to the beautiful colors; I am in love with these duos.  Honestly, when I looked at the shades I was a little afraid that I wasnu2019t going to like them. As a person with a deeper skin tone I normally find myself upset at brands because they either donu2019t cater to deeper skin tones or if they do the product is normally too light or ashy on the skin. I tried out the shades u201cEx-Girlfriendu201d which is pink and u201cLasting Loveu201d which is more of a coral color. Since I did a pink eyeshadow the matte shade from Ex-Girlfriend went perfectly with the look and I was happy that this shade was pigmented and didnu2019t come off as ashy. Iu2019m not a huge fan of shimmery blush but I will just repurpose it as a eyeshadow or an inner corner highlight. Lasting Love is very pretty as well but I just donu2019t see me reaching for it since I am not a big coral blush type of person, however; if this was more on the deeper orange side then I can definitely see me wearing it daily. This is not a huge problem for me because I can just use this blush as a eyeshadow.  I love that these are buildable so if you are the type of person who likes a dramatic blush then this is perfect for you because you can easily add more if need be but if you prefer a light blush then this is great for you as well."

This blush duo makes it simple to match colors and highlighter, giving me a lovely, radiant finish that goes well with my makeup. I care about clean beauty, so I'm glad this product is vegan, cruelty-free, and made with good ingredients. It's nice to know I can get a beautiful glow while being careful about what I put on my skin.I love how just a little blush can change how I look and feel, and the GXVE Feelinu2019 Cheeky Blush Duo makes it even better by having the perfect mix of colors for my skin.

I have been using Gxve- Amplifying Blush Duo in the shades Lasting Love and Ex-Girlfriend. The colors of u201cEx-Girlfriendu201d are a very rich bright pink and a light pink. And the colors of Lasting Love are a very rich peach shade and a light peach shade. I am pleasantly surprised by how much I like both these blushes.   Firstly, I love that these blushes are extremely pigmented in color which means a little goes a long way and you don't need a whole lot of product to achieve the look you are going for whether subtle or bold. These blushes duo comes in two shades- matte and shimmery. In my opinion both the shades can used separately or combined together.   Secondly, I love how light weight these blushes are. They have such a nice airy, smooth texture that my cheeks don't feel clogged up or heavy when I use these. These blush are also very long lasting. I only apply it once a day and it stays on the entire day. There's is no need for re applications throughout the day.   Thirdly, I love the packaging of these blushes. The packaging definitely screams luxury and a high end product. The mirror in the packaging comes in handy for viewing exactly where/how you are applying the blush. I also love the powdery sweet smell of the blush.   Over all these blushes are amazing with beautiful colors. And I highly recommend these blushes to those looking for a pigmented and vibrant color in blush. These colors will definitely look enhance any look.   *This review was collected as part of a promotion.*"

I have light skin, always pigmented blushes are a bit too much for me, I love the blushes are buildable and offer a natural flush of color. Ex-Girlfriend shade looks bold but it matches my skin tone and I can create a beautiful look. It is perfect balance between boldness and I love wear it in day or night out, I used my hand to build my blush, it was more effective than brush, The Lasting Love shade is a bit warmer than Ex-Girlfriend. This shade is also buildable like Ex-Girlfriend, but I prefer Ex-Girlfriend on my light skin tone. The formula is blendable, easy customization, and a natural finish. These two duo shades are a bit too similar, I would love to have a light with a darker shade. This review was collected as part of a promotion"

Gwen spared no expense and really went all in on the gorgeous packaging. The compact has a nice weight to it with a pretty gold paisley design on the outside and a mirror on the inside which is always appreciated!  What really sets this blush apart is the fact that it can be both layered and customized. It contains a sheer shimmery shade that can be worn on its own for a subtle glowy wash of color as well as a bold satin color in a coordinating shade that is for the more bold of heart. I personally love starting with the satin side and adding the glowy blush as a topper. The longevity on these blushes is very impressive. I have oily skin and it lasted all day on me.  This blush is the ultimate crowd pleaser whether you enjoy satin or glowy or subtle or bold blush. You really canu2019t go wrong!"

Definitely not u201ca little goes a long wayu201d. The good thing is that it is buildable. For a natural, subtle look, this blush will be good for you.

The Feelin' Cheeky Amplifying Blush Duo is the epitome of luxury, everything from the packaging to the color payoff screams high end! I tried the shades Ex-Girlfriend which is more of a bright pink/light pink combo and Lasting Love, which is more of a bright peach/light peach combo. I love how you have the option to either wear a combo of both shades in the palette or wear one or the other. This adds a lot of versatility to these shades, which is nice when you're traveling and try to switch up the look. Both palettes are BEAUTIFUL and the color payoff is really really nice. They blended into my dry skin without appearing cakey as some powder blushes may look. I love how the palettes come with a mirror, the actual palette is quite robust which is nice because when I take the palette somewhere I know that the blushes inside will be safe if it gets knocked around. The blushes also smell a bit like perfume, which also adds to the high end quality! I highly recommend!"

There was no harsh streaking or fighting to get them to blend correctly. I tried wearing the shades together one day which created a very lovely look and then used only the satin shade on another day to have a lighter more dewy look. You can completely play around with these to create your own styles to match what you need for the day.   This blush worked great over the top of my other make up and has a light powdery scent. It doesn't settle on dry skin patches or highlight them. It last all day. I find myself reaching for it again and again.  It's cruelty free and vegan. A clean product. Perfect for everyone."

However, Iu2019ve learned to make it work for me by playing around with it.

I then added a layer of  my favorite highlighter by Becca in the shade u201cChocolate Geode.u201d After this, I applied another layer of Feelinu2019 Cheeky.

From the moment I became a cosmetologist, I have been super intrigued with skincare and finding new product that works for me to be able to share with friends, family, and clients. I was beyond excited to be able to try out GXVE Feelinu2019 Cheeky Clean Amplifying Blush Duo. Iu2019m a lot more of a natural make up look kind of girl and was a little scared at first when I saw the shades. I got the EX-GIRLFRIEND and LASTING LOVE shades and felt like they would be too pigmented for me after swatching. I decided to give it a go and although they are very pigmented, they are most definitely blend-able. Iu2019m not big on using the satin over natural shade because I feel like itu2019s too much for my liking but I do like switching on and off both shades. Itu2019s very smooth to blend out and I love that itu2019s buildable for those who like a more bold statement. Definitely long lasting as I donu2019t even have to touch it up throughout the day. The shades are amazing as well and I finally tried shades outside of my comfort zone which was a win for me!"

One is usually a little shimmer and the other more opaque. I love this feature because you can mix them together or you can layer them OR just use one stand alone. The smell is pleasant and subtle. I love the packaging. The case its in is extremely durable and well made. It has an attractive look as well with a large mirror inside the pallet lid. I love the size of the mirror because some times the mirror in pallets are tiny and pretty much useless. This blush duo was well thought out in every way and I do highly recommend this blush. It stays on all day and when Iu2019m sweating my cheeks still have that nice touch of color!"

Today I wanted to talk about GXVE beauties feeling cheeky amplifying blush duo. This blush is super pigmented, the color glides on well and it smell just like your fanciest powder.  I really love that I can choose to use either color or I can mix both the shades to create my own shade or whatever I am feeling that day. I also love how cute this packaging is and how amazing this powder blush smells. I am a sucker when it comes to smells and it isnu2019t often I come across a blush that takes me back to the scented powder days, I love it.

Unlike some blushes, it wasn't chalky or patchy; instead, it went on silky and was extremely pigmented, seamlessly melting into the skin. What stands out about this formulation is its versatility. If you have dry skin, it won't cause texture or dryness. On the other hand, if you have oily skin, you'll appreciate that it provides an even application without looking super concentrated in one area. The packaging adds to the appeal, giving off a posh yet fun vibe. It not only looks expensive but also maintains its vibrant appearance throughout the day u2013 no disappearing into oblivion. The long-lasting quality of this blush is impressive, and it doesn't look artificial. I wholeheartedly recommend it for all ages and every skin type u2013 you won't be disappointed with the results."

Having tried various GXVE products before, my expectations were high, and I'm thrilled to say that this blush duo did not disappoint.  What drew me in immediately was the promise of an amped-up, talc-free formula in silky satin and vibrant radiant finishes. The fact that these blushes can be worn alone or layered for a fresh burst of color and an instant plumping effect had me intrigued.  The duo's main ingredients, particularly the inclusion of Sodium Hyaluronate, impressed me. Dullness be gone! It's great to know that I'm not just adding color to my cheeks, but also nourishing and enhancing the overall appearance of my skin.  The vegan, gluten-free, and cruelty-free nature of this product aligns perfectly with my values, and the recyclable packaging is a bonus for the environmentally conscious consumer.  Now, onto the shades! Lasting Love is a gorgeous coral hue that complements my skin tone beautifully. The duo includes a sheer satin shade for a touch of luminosity and dimension, while the natural, radiant shade kicks up the vibrancy. What I appreciate most is that the blush duo takes the guesswork out of layering. It makes customizing my glow and controlling color intensity a breeze.  The texture is velvety smooth, and the pigmentation is just right u2013 not too overwhelming but buildable for those days when I want a more intense look. The lasting power is impressive; it stayed vibrant throughout the day without any patchiness or fading.  In conclusion, the Feelin' Cheeky amplifying blush duo by GXVE Beauty in the shade Lasting Love has become a staple in my makeup routine. It not only delivers on its promises of color, dimension, and plumping effects but also aligns with ethical and environmental values.

I had the pleasure of trying this talc-free blush duo in two different monochromatic combinations, the Lasting Love duo and the Ex-Girlfriend duo. This blush duo has a lightweight, silky powder texture. It glides so smoothly onto the cheeks and leaves them popping with bold and beautiful color. Each duo fits a different makeup look. Lasting Love is a duo with a more reddish pink. The bottom shade is my favorite of the two because itu2019s a beautiful shade of pink. The top more reddish pink definitely fits some of my makeup looks too. If I had to pick a favorite blush duo it would be the Ex-Girlfriend because Iu2019m just a girl who is obsessed with pink. This duo has a light pink and a bolder pink shade to fit any mood Iu2019m in. I absolutely love the fancy, luxurious packaging. The lid is a shiny gold color with a floral design. I absolutely love the compact packaging that has a built in mirror that is the perfect size to help you  apply this amazing blush to your face. Apply the bottom more virbrant shade of blush from the apple of your cheeks and blend it towards your hairline. Then apply the top more satin shade to the cheekbones and then add a dusting to the nose for a sun kissed look. I would recommend this to any rebellious rockstar in their teens and older looking for a beautiful blush duo compact that will reduce skin dullness, hydrates your skin, adds dimension to your makeup look and that makes your cheeks pop with color."

First things first, the color you see in the palette is the color you get when you apply. These blushes are super pigmented and bright you barely need to touch the blush with your brush to get color. While they were super pigmented i also found them hard to blend. I spent a lot of the time buffing it in and then going back over with foundation or powder to tone it down. I do like that these come in pairs of complimentary colors, you can even use one shade as more of a contour and the other as the blush or you can mix them together. In all it was okay but ive had better blushes that are pigmented and blend well."

These colors pop! At first glance, I thought there wasnu2019t much product in the beautiful packaging, but low and behold, it is pigmented to the extreme! A little goes a long way and it stays! Many blushes I have tried in my career will fade throughout the day and need so much application to see the color. These blushes only need the smallest amount to show and they will stay all day even after touching your face. The only thing that made me reconsider 5 stars was the artificial floral smell it had. It is clean makeup and doesn't use synthetics but it still wasn't a pleasant smell for me personally. This makeup line really is performance meets play!"

The texture of the blush is silky and smooth. And it has a nice floral scent. It glides on my face smoothly. The color is even and blendable. It gives you a luminous radiant finish.

One was more matte and the other a lighter shade to compliment and highlight. I tried the blush duo on my cheeks and loved how the color just so easily swept my cheeks with these blushes in the shade of peach. They are nicely pigmented and blend so easy.

As a music lover, I love that she named the products after some classic hit songs, too! Now, back to my love of this blush duo. I like wearing each color alone or blending them to create a higher definition of my cheeks. The colors are very universal (I have two shades: Ex-Girlfriend (bright pink tones) and Lasting Love (coral tones), so I like to mix and match to create the signature blush look I desire. It doesnu2019t flair up any redness to my skin and enhances my complexion. It glides on silky smooth on the skin, giving a flawless finish I love. Gwen creatively put a lot of thought into making the shades of this product stand out from all the rest.  This blush duo contains two luxurious and complementary shades that seamlessly blend into cheeks and highlight my T-zone area. The pigmentation of the shades is vibrant enough that I can easily control the application- not too sheer, not cakey while creating a luminous, natural, flush cheek. Yet it can be buildable for a more customized dramatic look! The gorgeous compact fits in my bag without taking up too much room, and another plus is that when I apply this blush, I get a delightful rush of fresh powder scent! Another bonus to this product is that it amplifies the creases of my eyes, making them pop out more, and it looks great!"

I got to try out lasting love and ex-girlfriend which are two beautiful pink colors. One is more of a purple pink and one is more of a peach pink. Both of these products were super pigmented once applied to the skin but blended beautifully with the rest of my make up. I was honestly scared at first when I put it on my skin because there is a ton of pigment in these products but once I started blending with a clean brush, it blended out beautiful.

Iu2019m disappointed that this blush is heavily perfumed, or perfumed at all, because that means I canu2019t even apply it to my face or I will have a vicious allergic reaction. And honestly, I donu2019t know why cosmetics brands scent their primers, foundations, blushes, eyeshadows, setting sprays, etc. By the time you have your makeup on, youu2019re wearing 9 different perfumes, especially if your face wash and moisturizer and SPF are also scented.

I have 3 shades (the peachy beige, lavender and coral pink) and they all work wonderfully on my medium tan skin tone. I find them to be long lasting and don't fade throughout the day. I highly recommend them. The only downside for some would be the smell - it's strong - even if you hold the blush at arms length you can smell it. It's very Macy's department store smell to me, which doesn't bother me but I did want to note it because if you're sensitive to fragrance I would avoid this one."

They blended well and looked natural once applied. The blush does not come with its own brush, so you will need to use your own brush or fingers to apply. The case also includes a mirror which is perfect for on the go. This is a really great value for 2 blushes that compliment each other and will last a long time!

The packaging of the blush is appealing with a reflective gold case with a white paisley pattern, and when you open the box that it comes in, there's also a peek of matching red paisley pattern which is a fun little surprise. Inside the case, there's also a small mirror for convenience. At first glance, the colors are attractive and complimentary. When I first tried the blush, I followed the suggested application provided on the back of the box (start with matte sweeping from apples along your cheek bone to your temples, finish with shimmer on apples). I was very impressed with the pigmentation, and I highly recommend applying with a light hand: a little bit goes a long way! I have light skin and I felt like this shade was bordering on too pink for my skintone and a more neutral shade may be more flattering on me. However, I do still like it as long as I apply it lightly. Although the $28 price point may feel high for a blush, I feel that it's worth it for the quality, along with the versatility provided with two shades that can be wore separately or used together. (It also smells nice!)"

One such product that has become an absolute favorite of mine is this blush. I have been using it every single day and cannot recommend it enough to fellow makeup lovers. Firstly, the blush's color range is absolutely fantastic. No matter what your skin tone or desired look may be, this product has a shade that will complement you perfectly. Whether you prefer a subtle, natural flush or a vibrant pop of color, there is something for everyone. The pigmentation is also outstanding, ensuring that even the smallest amount goes a long way. What truly sets this blush apart is its impeccable formula. It glides onto the skin seamlessly, imparting a beautiful, radiant finish. The texture is velvety smooth, allowing for easy application and blending. It never feels cakey or powdery and stays put for hours on end, even through a busy day. The product is also buildable, making it suitable for both a soft, everyday look and a more intense evening makeup. One of the things I appreciate most about this blush is its long-lasting power. It remains vibrant and fresh throughout the day, without ever fading or becoming patchy. I no longer worry about touch-ups as it effortlessly withstands heat and humidity. The product's durability is truly remarkable, making it an ideal choice for any occasion. Moreover, the packaging is sleek and compact, making it convenient for travel or on-the-go touch-ups. The mirror included inside is an added bonus, allowing for quick and easy application wherever you may be. The compact size also means that it won't take up too much space in your makeup bag or vanity, making it a practical addition to any collection. I would highly recommend this product! (Note: This review is based on my personal experience with the product. Results may vary.)"

The moment I saw these shades of pink, I knew Iu2019d HAVE to try it as an eyeshadow, too. And let me tell you, it makes some fierce eyeshadow. As a blush, I use the shimmery of the two where I normally would a highlighter, and the darker shade I use where Iu2019d normally apply my blush. For the eyes, the shimmery one goes on the lid, and the darker one contours before you complete it with a nice and sharp cat-eye. Seriouslyu2026 fierce af. And it wears well both ways! So its essentially a blush palette and an eyeshadow palette in one! Gifted by GXVE Beauty in exchange for my honest review."

These are GORGEOUS, and please know the online pics do not accurately represent their true tones. These are bright, not muted or earthy. The color saturation is like a Pantone swatch and the texture is fine, smooth,and soft. IMO these are the star product of Gwen's unique, fun, and price-friendly line. Don't be fooled by how affordable they are, these are top quality and the only hard part is choosing which combo or combos to buy! They blend easily and can be a sheer wash like the popular Dior or intensified for a more dramatic look, yet your skin will still show through because of the quality. No chalkiness here!  I believe every beautiful skin tone from mahogany to milk will be enhanced perfectly by  at least one of these color combos. The fact you get two tones in one compact make this even more fun! Honestly, I think this is the top blush intro of the season in a season that is ALL about the blush. Once I decide which combo I can't live without, I will return to Sephora to purchase."

I have fair/light skin so I was worried the darker shade would be too bold, but you can build the color. I can see this being a nice fall transition since itu2019s rich in color and a powder (I usually go for creams). Also - it does have a slightly sweet flowery smell, as a heads up!

Also the packaging is too cute and has a handy mirror to it. Blush is pigmented and little goes long way . The shade range is also amazing from pink to berry. They have shade for every skintone.
