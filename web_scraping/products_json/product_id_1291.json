It's super lightweight, awesome for oily-combo skin, and has really helped brighten my skin and even out overall complexion. The only thing that sucks is that there seems to be some inconsistencies with production in terms of the product's stability. Usually I don't have an issue and every time I open a new bottle it's completely clear and lasts well, however the last 2 bottles in a row that I've purchased were already oxidized as soon as I opened the bottle :( Definitely not worth paying 75 dollars for a product that is essentially useless if it's already oxidized, so I'm not sure if I want to continue using this product or not. I love the results I get from it but it's quite annoying to keep having to return a bottle because of batch stability issues."

However, when I used it more than twice a week, it caused irritation on my nose. I found that my skin became dry and sensitive in those areas. The concentration of the product seems too high for daily use, especially for sensitive skin like mine. Consequently, I do not recommend using it daily. For those with less sensitive skin, it may be beneficial to use it twice a week as I did, but it is important to observe how your skin reacts and adjust the frequency accordingly. Always perform a patch test on a small area of skin before incorporating a new product into your regular routine. Moderation is key to avoiding adverse reactions and maintaining healthy, glowing skin."

I will start with the slight cons, which in my opinion, are easy to get past and youu2019ll want to for the pros of this product. First, itu2019s slightly watery. When I applied it with my fingers alone, it started to drip and it was absorbing quicker into my into my skin than I could put it on. My fix for that was to use less if applying with your fingers, or even better, add it in with the serum or moisturizer of your choice. The second slight con is it has a bit of an earthy smell, which isnu2019t that appealing. My fix is the same as the first; use it with a nice smelling serum or moisturizer if it bothers you. If youu2019d rather not use anything, thankfully the smell is not so overwhelming or overpowering and it doesnu2019t stay too long once on your skin.  if you can get past it while applying it, youu2019re good.   Now that I have put out what I thought were cons, hereu2019s the pros. Everything else. Brighter skin. Smoother skin. Softer skin. I almost could not believe how well a product worked in a short amount of time.  I tried to use it twice a day, but sometimes only used it once and still experienced a noticeable difference to my face. And a little goes a long way.   I will say honestly, the very first time I used this product, I did experience slight redness and irritation, but only for a few minutes and then going forward, there was neither.  Personally, my skin has a tendency to become a little red or sensitive with new products, so it may have just been my own skin and even so, it truly wouldnu2019t stop me from using it. I canu2019t believe how amazing my skin feels.   After using it for nearly two weeks, my sensitive skin looks and feels flawless, without drying it out and it makes me feel confident and radiant. Paulau2019s Choice is my choice."

After incorporating this product into my routine for two weeks, I observed notable improvements in my skin's overall appearance and texture. The formulation, which combines 15% Vitamin C with Vitamin E and Ferulic Acid, significantly enhanced my skin's tone and luminosity. Areas of discoloration and uneven skin tone were visibly reduced, resulting in a more uniform and vibrant complexion. Additionally, there was a marked reduction in the appearance of fine lines, particularly around the eyes and mouth, indicating an improvement in skin firmness. The C15 Super Booster integrates seamlessly into a daily skincare routine. I applied a few drops each morning after cleansing and before moisturizing and applying sunscreen. The lightweight formula absorbs rapidly, leaving no sticky residue, and is suitable for layering under other skincare products. It is important to highlight that this product features a new and improved reformulation, which may enhance its effectiveness. In summary, Paula's Choice C15 Super Booster is a highly effective product for improving skin tone, radiance, and firmness, making it a valuable addition to any professional skincare routine."

Skin Tone and Discoloration: One of the most remarkable changes I noticed after using C15 Vitamin C Super Boost was the improvement in my skin's tone and reduction in discoloration. Over time, my complexion appeared more even and radiant, with stubborn dark spots noticeably fading away. Whether it was from sun damage or past blemishes, the blend of vitamin C seemed to work wonders in restoring clarity to my skin."

The consistency is thinner and less sticky than before, making it easy to mix with my daily moisturizer. I have noticed a beautiful glow to my skin after using it, I would recommend patch testing. I have sensitive skin and usually have trouble with products that incorporate vitamin C. It would cause irritation or breakouts, but this product has been gentle and non-irritating. There is also no lingering smell, which is a huge plus for me. But I donu2019t believe this product will targets my concerns, being that it targets fine lines and wrinkles."

I have noticed that it has brightened my complexion and reduced the appearance of dark spots. It has also helped smooth out fine lines specifically in my forehead, giving my skin a more youthful look. I love that itu2019s a lightweight formula that absorbs quickly without leaving any residue, which makes it easy to layer with other products. I haven't experienced any irritation, which is great considering its potency and the sensitivity of my skin. Overall, this booster is an excellent choice if youu2019re looking to enhance skin's radiance and address signs of aging."
