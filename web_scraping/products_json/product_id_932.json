It\u2019s smells so artificial & just not good imo. WHY?! The first two ingredients are just water & silicones.. For this price point, I expect the bulk of the formula to be better quality ingredients. I could be wrong, but I didn\u2019t see mineral oil/paraffin/petroleum listed in this one, while they are in La Mer\u2019s other face creams, so that is one possible improvement at least. If you want any moisture, this is not for you. Definitely for oily skin girlies only. I normally have very clear skin. I test new skincare frequently & this is the first cream that\u2019s broken me out in forever. I do avoid silicones & artificial fragrance in my usual routine, so I imagine they\u2019re the culprits. It also made my favorite trusted tinted SPF pill on me, which it has never done in the 3 years of using it. Again, probably the crazy high silicone content\u2019s fault. So definitely need silicone-based base products with this. Yes, there are some good ingredients mixed into this water & silicone-based formula, but the cons are just so bad, I can\u2019t see any beneficial pros from them :( I received sample sizes to test, so I can\u2019t comment on the quality of the actual packaging, however, that doesn\u2019t look impressive from the pictures. lol Hopefully it\u2019s at least glass, but dang, it\u2019s looks cheap & ugly & that\u2019s just sad for something high-end. Do yourself a favor & get one of the hundreds of moisturizers that are far superior & cheaper. *gifted by lamer"

I really think for my dry skin the regular cream is my favorite but I absolutely love the texture of this. It is the perfect summer cream. It\u2019s not as much of a thin gel as I thought it would be\u2026it\u2019s a creamy gel- but not too creamy! Enough to know you are getting moisture but it\u2019s not going to leave behind all kinds of oil and extra humectants for those who have oilier skin but need hydration as well. I was really satisfied with it. And I tried it on my mom and she liked it a lot. Offered by lamer"

Mild fragrance which I typically don\u2019t care for in skincare but it didn\u2019t bother me. Too soon to tell if there were any changes with my skin, and would probably need a full size product.

It absorbed quickly without leaving any shiny residue, which is a huge relief. Often, moisturizers make my skin feel even oilier, but with this cream, my skin felt comfortable and balanced.  Hours later, my skin still felt soft and there were no signs of excessive shine. Even under makeup, the cream acted as an excellent base, keeping my skin nourished without compromising the durability of my foundation.  What I liked the most was how my skin looked healthier and how the cream worked in harmony with my oily skin rather than against it. I will definitely continue using The New Moisturizing Fresh Cream and am excited to see how it improves my skin with continued use."

Since original Creme de La Mer is too heavy for me in warmer months when my skin develops an oily t-zone, I\u2019m thrilled with The Moisturizing Fresh Cream. This lighter formula lets my skin benefit from Miracle Broth without over moisturizing or causing breakouts. It soaks in quickly, leaving my face soft and supple. I love the light scent and the way my skin feels primed for makeup. This is a holy grail moisturizer for me."

The 3.5ml sample size is generous enough to allow for a thorough trial, and I appreciate that it's formulated without harsh ingredients like parabens, formaldehydes, and sulfates. Knowing that it's free of these chemicals gives me peace of mind about what I'm putting on my skin. The Miracle Broth-infused formula feels luxurious upon application, and I can feel it working to rebalance sebum production and defend against signs of aging. After incorporating it into my skincare routine, I've noticed an improvement in my skin's firmness and elasticity, as well as a reduction in excess oiliness. Overall, La Mer's Moisturizing Fresh Cream has exceeded my expectations, delivering on its promise of refreshed balance and a firmer feel. It's become a staple in my skincare regimen, and I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for an effective moisturizer, especially those with oilier skin types like mine. Gifted by lamer."

Super cute minis and the pouch it came in was so pretty too! This has a fairly potent fragrance that reminds me of baby powder. It has another scent I\u2019m not familiar with but it dissipates fairly quickly once applied to the skin.   This does have a nice gel texture that absorbs fast and leaves my skin feeling pleasantly hydrated. No major dewy or glowy finish but I think this would work best with oily or normal skin types. I am dry to normal skin type during the winter months too. I find this to be the perfect amount of hydration and texture. If you have super dry skin, I\u2019m not sure if this will be hydrating enough. Though you can always pair it with a facial oil too. I am enjoying this so far and would recommend to anyone looking for a new boujee moisturizer!"
