This cream feels very good after application, absorbing well and leaving no sticky or tacky feeling. As a bonus, stick it in the fridge for that cooling effect, and I feel it helps with swelling a little. I've experienced no irritation or redness. While I've only been using it a short time, I'm sold. I've started to see improvement in the appearance of swelling around my eyes, reducing the puffiness of my bags and also the coloring. I'll continue to add this to my regimen, and hopefully we can get this under control haha. I received this product for free for my honest review."

I've noticed a visible reduction in puffiness within minutes of applying it, and over time, my under-eye area looks less tired and more refreshed. The caffeine really seems to work its magic!  What I also love is how affordable it is compared to other eye creams, yet it delivers results just as effectively. A little goes a long way, so the small tube lasts longer than you'd expect.  If you're looking for an eye cream that energizes and brightens without feeling heavy, I highly recommend this one.

I had seen a tip to stick it in the fridge for extra cooling so I tried it, and it felt great! If you have a skincare fridge this would be a great product to keep in there. The packaging is nice too, I'm not a fan of the eye creams with the applicators that you rub on your face so I was glad to see this didn't have that. The only issue I have is that it may not be good if you have super sensitive skin since it had a little bit of a tingly effect and my skin is only slightly sensitive. Overall I really like this eye cream and I would most likely replace this tube when I finish it."

I usually have some severe dryness around my eyes and it always makes my concealer lift and crease. It just never looks right! But with this, I had the most hydrated under eyes I've ever had and not a crease in sight, even with thick, drying concealer! This may be a new staple for me!"

I'm bad at keeping up with my skincare routine too, but this product has made such a difference in my under eyes' appearance. The puffiness is super reduced and they look so much better. A little goes a VERY long way so I'm fed gonna have this product for a long time. Will keep repurchasing though!!"

I keep it in the fridge and 5 minutes after applying I can get my contacts in much easier than I could have before. Will definitely be keeping this on hand as long as they make it.
