I love the smell of it as well as the applicator; it's so good that I don't even need to look into the mirror to apply it on my lips. However, I find that it doesn't last very long, which is such a shame because it has a great texture and feel! Since it doesn't last too long, that also means that I didn't notice any change in my lips. They weren't necessarily dryer, but they didn't feel deeply moisturized. If you are looking for a lip balm for deep moisture, I don't think this is it. But if you want a balm that leaves a sheer tint and an amazing glossy finish, then this is the perfect product for you!"

However, I still find it lacking when it comes to actually hydrating the lips. I can feel my lips becoming drier, and it feels like this product is just retaining the moisture that is already there, instead of hydrating my lips and leaving them better nourished or conditioned. For products in similar price ranges, I would much rather have the Eadem, Ole Henriksen, or Tatcha. All of those products leave my lips feeling plush and better than initial application. Even lower cost brands like Neutrogena have better balms when it comes to improving the texture and appearance of the lips over this product."

            "review_text": "'Birthday Cake' was my first (and favorite) offering from SF's various lip butter balms. Now that it's very difficult to get hold of, I've settled on what I believed to be the nearest match: Pink Sugar. The two share a similar vanilla/marshmallow fragrance and taste, with the biggest being that Birthday cake had a stunning iridescent shimmer to it, whereas Pink Sugar has none of that, instead it is pretty much clear, with just a hint of pink and (to me at least) tastes like icing! The scent is quite strong at first but dies down after a while. I do love the buttery texture which is neither too heavy/greasy, nor too light. My lips always feel well-conditioned during and after applying these, and never sticky. Having said that I still prefer Birthday Cake from the two and hope it's added to the permanent line up in the future. 'Cherry' - a sheer red which contains a lot more pigment than the aforementioned shades, is another firm favorite of mine.    ~ My Top 5 Beauty must-have list ~  1.

The other vanillas and sugars have a weird underlying burnt plastic taste. The brown sugar however is YUMMY mhm, and the taste lasts too.  SMUDGING: As long as you let it set for a 20 minutes you can drink or eat and it wonu2019t completely smudge on the straw. It lasts so long too, literally all day without too much activity and i apply it maybe 2-3 times a day if im busy. COLOR: The color is stunningly versatile too. Itu2019s evenly pigmented and is subtle enough to look natural but bold enough to balance your face. SMOOTH: It is extremely smooth, itu2019s not buttery it is velvety mhmmm im in love. Only complaint is every time i put it on there is literally one grit. literally one single grit. its so weird but like pshhhhh whatever everythimg else is perfect MY OPINION: yas five stars i get the hype. Personally i would use this during the day and not as a nighttime moisturizer because it kinda crusts my lips overnight, im guessing cause its not getting reapplied. atm i have this and an olehenriksen lip balm which i use overnight. Iu2019d definitely check out the olehenriksen if you want  a longer lasting and less gritty lip balm, but for daytime i love summer fridays"
