A: The color is beautiful without being too shiny. If you have combination skin like mine and you don't want to add A LOT of shine to your face then this would be the product for you as the shimmer is subtle but pretty.  Would you buy this product? A: Yes.   Would you recommend this product to your friends or family? A: Yes."

But my favorite way to apply is underneath foundation, all over my cheekbone area and on other high points on my face and then proceed with foundation. This way, I don't have to worry about messing with my blush. To be honest, I haven't been using any highlighters these days, but since this liquid illuminator is so easy to use, I have really been enjoying adding that step to my routine. And it is also very easy to increase or decrease the intensity of shine with this, that I highly recommend this liquid highlighter If you are looking to add a highlighter to your collection."

This illuminator is an outstanding choice for anyone seeking a luminous glow with a luxurious feel. It offers a concentrated shimmer that can be seamlessly integrated with your foundation, primer, or moisturizer. Alternatively, it shines brightly when used alone, highlighting the cheekbones, nose tip, collarbones, and cupid's bow with just a few drops.  The application is a breeze; the formula is designed to be ultra-blendable, allowing for a smooth glide and a perfect blend into the skin without any hassles. This ease of use is enhanced by the product's buildable nature, making it suitable for both a subtle shine and a more intense glow.  One of the most striking effects of the Iconic Illuminator is its ability to provide a 'soft focus' effect that beautifully accentuates high points of the face with a radiant, dewy finish. The shimmering drops enhance your natural features, providing a healthy, glowing look that doesn't feel overdone.  Durability is another strong point of this illuminator. It maintains its radiant effect throughout the day without the need for touch-ups, making it reliable for long-lasting wear.  Overall, the Iconic Illuminator Liquid Highlight is a top-tier product that delivers on its promises of luminosity, ease of application, and lasting wear. Itu2019s no wonder that it comes highly endorsed by celebrities and makeup professionals. If you're looking to elevate your makeup routine with a touch of glamour, this illuminator is definitely worth the investment."

All of the pigment and high shine may seem daunting, so thatu2019s why I recommend putting a small amount on the back of your hand, spreading it out, and then using a cream product specific brush or damp sponge to pick it up and apply it onto your face. That way, it will apply as more of a wash of glow than a streak. Also, once dried down, this doesnu2019t budge!

If you're not new to makeup, you know this highlighter is just as the brand suggests; Iconic. It's been around forever and has gone viral several times... but I must admit, with all of the liquid and powder highlighter options on the market, after trying and reviewing this one, it wouldn't be the first I reached for.  The amount of working time you're given before the product dries down on your skin is less than a minute. If you apply it and immediately work it where you want it, it's quite pretty, but do ONE CHEEK at a time.  Don't be like me and dot both cheeks at the same time and then work on each one separately for a couple minutes; one side dried down and left the dots behind (see pic). I was able to reapply my foundation over it to correct. (I did try using a sponge, finger AND brush for application, finger works best).  If you're dying to try this, the mini would probably suffice; the tiniest bit goes a long way and would last a while.  I did like that it's versatile and could use it other ways too. (Like as an eyeshadow primer). Overall, I'd recommend, I suppose if you really want to try. Just be careful with letting the product sit too long."

It wasn't!   It has a beautiful glittery shimmer to it. It's so versatile, you can use it for a natural everyday look or add it to your glam routine. It blends well (i blend with my finger tips). I think i'm going to be repurchasing in other shades. I'm so glad i bought this, i just wish it was cheaper cus i'm broke lol. I set this using Urban Decay all nighter spray and it lasted throughout my 8-hour shift.   As another reviewer mentioned, a little goes a long way. Initially, when i pulled the bottle out of the box i was crushed because it seemed soo small and i thought it wouldn't last long. But then i discovered you really don't need any more than a pinch. Like, a really small dallop. The dot on my hand is not even half of what I used. And the shine is soo flattering and makes my cheekbones pop. It's buildable so you can also layer more product to intensity the shine, but i personally like more of a natural look.  i'm so happy this worked out. my favorite highlighter by far. :))"

This liquid pigment is a multitasker, adding a light-catching, subtle-to-brilliant, natural glow to the cheek and brow bones, nose bridge and to whichever area one chooses to add light. As ai have medium-deep skin, I use shade Original on top of Iconic London's Radiance Complexion Booster in Toffee Glow for depth, and Bronze Glow for all over coverage. Paired with a medium coverage concealer beneath the eyes, a lippie. and mascara, I am out the door! The possibilities are endless! And one bottle will easily last 100+ applications, because one drop is plenty! A price point of $40 is a steal compared to celebrity-endorsed, inferior products. Try a Charlotte Tilbury powder to seal, and be ready to take on the world! I am 58, and look faboo!"

If I'm going for a fuller makeup look, I still add my powdered highlighter, blush, and bronzer for more colour.  But this is beautiful for a poolside summer day with just my SPF and mascara with no powders.  Overall, I like this product but I don't love it - it fades too fast and is overpriced.  Would recommend this line if they match their prices with the drugstore quality that they are, but not when they're comparable in price to higher end makeup lines.  Full disclosure, I also purchased the JLo beauty highlighter at the same time, and two days in a row, tried each product on each cheek and JLo stuck longer."

Iu2019m even going to try mixing a drop with body lotion because I have been wanting to find the perfect body highlight now too. I also love the drop applicator bc it lets you control the amount you add (although I find 1 drop to be the perfect amount) and I do feel like a crafty little mixologist when I do this ;)"

Leaves a model-like look on the skin, where it appears that the skin is wet and healthy.  I really love it, I have used more than half and in my case my skin is oily, but I like that effect of healthy skin but I do not like to be shiny because of the oils, so what I do is mix the illuminator with the base,  mix the highlighter with the primer or apply it on top of foundation and it really lasts all day.  Another thing to keep in mind is that it dries fast, that's why I mix it up.  The photos is to give you an idea of the color (Original)."

The best part is that it blends out very easily using just my fingers, which allows me to place the highlight precisely where I want it.  Given how little I use, this will last forever.
