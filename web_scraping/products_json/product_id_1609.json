Despite using a primer and wetting my finger with setting spray, that topper ended up traveling all over my face, and the other shades didn't have great longevity either. I'm pretty disappointed, I expected more from Tom Ford after all the hype and at this price point, but I didn't find this formula to be worth the splurge."

I was a bit hesitant as I have heard that this formula is more fussy but this palette did not disappoint! Formula is spot on for a classic eyeshadow formula - pigmented, creamy, and little kickback. The Tropical Dusk palette offers a gorgeous neutral smoky look that you can go from day to night with. The shimmer dark copper shadow is very sparkly and applies easily with a brush. This palette will go into my daily rotations. 10/10 highly recommend!"
