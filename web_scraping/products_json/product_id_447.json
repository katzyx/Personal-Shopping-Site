I am not a huge fan of skin scents usually, I like something with a little more projection, but I think this gives exactly that. I did get complimented on this fragrance when wearing it as well. The first note I smell is citrus (I think the bergamot) and then after the dry down it becomes a soft musky scent. Overall I really enjoy it and I think it would be fantastic for the fall."

The top notes of bergamot and cassis open with a fresh, invigorating burst that immediately draws you in.

Initially it smells like black currant and citrus but quickly unfurls into a warm, jasmine smell. Itu2019s not especially strong. Iu2019d call it a perfect airplane or workout class fragrance because you can wear it without nauseating the people around you. You can really only smell it if you sniff your skin, which I like. (Iu2019m not a fan of overpowering fragrances.) It also stays put. I worked out, showered, and I can still smell a bit where I spritzed it on my wrist."

As per the name, it's surprisingly hard to describe this scent, I had to come here to look at the actual notes. While it's very light, it's somehow still very complex. As someone who doesn't like floral or feminine scents, while I would describe this as on the feminine side, it's such a specific musky, mellow, sweet scent I really like it. Especially on the dry down, it becomes warm and a little spicy. Not heavy or cloying at all. It does have a slightly sour/marine/powder note that some people may not like, but for me it works so well. And maybe this is just me but it almost smells like.... leather? Like the smell of a real, soft leather jacket - a little musky yet sweet. My only complaint is there is barely any staying power, pleaaaase fix this! I am very glad their travel sizes are sprays rather than rollerballs, which always helps a little with staying power. I recommend sampling this in store and seeing how it wears on you. Took a few tries for me to get into it but I don't think I could live without it now!"

I have a lot of perfumes, so I don't wear it everyday - but every time I put it on I consider throwing away the rest of my collection.   This is not for people looking for a light, airy scent. This scent demands attention and keeps it without much effort. I find it lasts all day, sometimes I'll still find it lingering on a jacket that I wore weeks ago. That being said, I do go nose blind to it sometimes so I might not notice it but other people definitely still do.   It's dramatic and captivating and I don't see a future where I don't own a bottle of this!"

It does smell earthy, floral and musky but it's a perfect blend to the point one doesn't overpower the other. Yet you can smell all three. At first you think it's an old lady smell but give it 30 minutes and that goes away. Everyone is different but I really like it.

It smells unique, sophisticated and luxurious in a very understated way...kind of like the scent I might notice at a very swanky hotel...or if you watch Succession, I feel like Shiv might wear this one. I'll buy the travel size spray because I don't go through perfumes quickly so it should last a while. Another favorite of mine is Diptyque's Philosykos perfume, for reference...it too is unique, light and fresh, though a bit more flowery and stronger than Myth."

This sets into the skin perfectly and isn't too strong but a more natural fresh musk. I've tried others over the last year and I keep coming back to this. It's the perfect signature scent for day and night. If you're considering buying it, this is your sign!!!"

I still don't hate it, I've even worn it a few times hoping to smell what I originally smelled in the first vial.  However I'm a woman who likes traditionally womanly perfume (sweeter?/sexier?

I typically love aquatic fresh scents but something about this one just feels so right. I agree with many of the other reviewers stating the staying power isnu2019t great, but Iu2019ve noticed if I spray two sprays on my wrists and a separate spray or two on my chest it lingers for hours.

Decent sillage but it had great longevity.  I decided to buy a full bottle.  I have been wearing it for weeks now, on and off, and I have to say I'm seriously disappointed. From my very first spray, it smelled like an incredibly watered down version of the sample. I mean 3/4 water, 1/4 scent.  I've had to overspray just to smell ANYTHING.  I wanted to be sure I wasn't losing my mind so I sprayed the crook of my elbow with 3 sprays, waited about 10 minutes, and had my husband smell.  He said, What am I suppossed to smell. Yikes!  Seriously disappointing, especially considering the cost.  I should have returned but I haven't gone into a store/mall in quite some time. Sephora, I hope you look into this!"

Fast forward to getting a sample of this perfume. The moment I smelled this, I immediately recognized the same notes in that perfume my babysitter wore, immediately took me back to good memories of my childhood and maybe the nostalgia is part of why I love this so much. It definitely smells unique, I do not notice many fragrances that remind me of this. I would always sample fragrances before blind buy. I dont wear this everyday, but definitely still love it..very soft, unique and feminine. Id say fits ladies best that are ages 25 and up, its definitely not a young teenager scent in my opinion"

If youu2019re the type of person that perfume changes on your skin. Get this to spritz lightly on your clothing. The scent lasts for HOURS. And it is maybe a little strong for the 1st few mins.

I should also note I received a small sample before buying a bigger size, and the sample lasted a REALLY long time because this scent lasted awhile on my skin and was well concentrated."

Before this, I used Viktor & Rolf's Flowerbomb, D&G Light Blue, and Elizabeth and James' Black Nirvana. Those scents all have more unique/distinguishing features (Flowerbomb is spicy, Light Blue is citrus-y, etc). Myth is very neutral, which is what I like about it and why it has become my go to, while the others I will wear if I'm in a certain mood. Staying power is decent, but I think less than the other perfumes I mentioned.   Will buy again when I finish the bottle!"

I love most fragrances, but I'm increasingly trying to go clean. I like many of the Phlur line, too, but they *tend* (except for Ameline) to go strangely sugary with my body chemistry. What I love about Myth is its subtle edge and the absolutely (to my nose) PERFECT cocktail of gentle floral, amber, musk, and woods. Really, nothing dominates. And if all clean fragrances can be a little fleeting -- this is a good thing, in a way, since it's testament to the fact that they don't contain creepy, clingy, stick-to-your-skin chemicals! -- I find at least with Ellis fragrances one extra spritz on clothes goes a long way toward extending the projection and keeping more of the composition of the fragrance in your general personal space for longer. Really lovely fragrance, with the good kind of nostalgia mixed into it!"

Myth does linger on my hair and clothing, so I think I just acclimate to it. Also, it does not break my out in a rash, which most fragrances do.  I just love it.

I can smell some white flowers in it, which I normally hate, but it is blended well with other scents and it keeps it from being cloying like most white flower notes. And thankfully it is not powdery at all (I hate powdery notes). I normally go for young scents over mature ones, but I can't place this scent in either category. it's kind of ageless.

I put it on next to the sink, ready to scrub it off, but it is just GORGEOUS! It smells like clean skin, straight out of the shower after having used expensive soap: creamy, with just the slightest hint of sweetness from the coconut and a faint whiff of ocean air. As with most non-toxic fragrances, it doesn't have a ton of staying power on the skin, but it lasts longer on hair and clothes. I don't mind reapplying, though. It feels like a little shot of luxury and self-care throughout the day."

Itu2019s just a very delicate, beautiful feminine scent that is very inoffensive while maintaining pretty decent wear time. Definitely wears longer than Jo Malone, Chloe and most Clean Reserve fragrances, but it doesnu2019t have the depth of a Burberry or Dior.

My boyfriend came home later and commented on how good I smelled, and after smelling each wrist he loved this scent far better than the other. I love changing scents based on my mood, the weather, etc., and I'm definitely adding this one to my arsenal. Don't be turned off by the initial alcohol smell.  Give it a few minutes and I think you'll be shocked how lovely it smells. I, too, find myself smelling my wrists throughout the day! :)"

The dry down is really enchanting; you get more of the florals (jasmine) and eventually the musks which still retain an undefinable sweetness. I find this perfume addictive, enticing, and romantic--I can see why it's so highly rated! It's not super long lasting, like other's have said, and I find myself reapplying often and generously. However, I still really enjoy catching wisps of deliciousness as it fades. I do not recall seeing any reviews that said they received complements from other people on this scent, and I have not yet either. This makes me think it is more of a skin scent and doesn't project very far--which I'm perfectly fine with because I prefer subtle, intimate scents over loud ones."

This scent is to die for.  Itu2019s heavenly.  Iu2019d give this 5+ stars in a heartbeat.....except for one very major problem:  the scent is weak and it just doesnu2019t last.  Within an hour or maybe two tops, the scent is gone.  Youu2019d have to spray about 20 spritzes to smell anything beyond a couple of hours.  Now, if perhaps youu2019re looking for something that is VERY close to your skin, something that you want nobody else to notice except perhaps yourself and maybe someone youu2019re being very u201ccloseu201d with, then this is for you.  But if youu2019d like your scent to be noticed at least SLIGHTLY by someone else, anyone else, then you should (sadly) take a pass on this one.  I loooove this fragrance.  But I canu2019t justify spending $100 on something that is gone in an hour.  I went through the mini spray bottle (.33 fluid oz.) in 3 days.  No joke.  Three days.  Because I had to keep spritzing it on me all day long.  Such a bummer.  If they can find a way to improve the silage and longevity, this would be my signature scent for LIFE.  Hands down.  For life.  And btw, using the body lotion with the eau de parfum doesnu2019t help either.  Tried that.  Didnu2019t work."

I'll be wearing this throughout fall and winter."
