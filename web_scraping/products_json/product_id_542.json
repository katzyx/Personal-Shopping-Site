I like how it doesn't sting my eyes and thoroughly cleans my face of makeup and impurities, without making my skin feel tight or irritated. I use a scrub afterwards to clear my pores. I switch products occasionally because it's expensive! I buy the value size when it's available. I prefer the value-size tube because it's easier to use in the shower, but it's not available on a regular basis.  A reminder to those of us with sensitive skin and/or allergies: always do a patch test. The correct way for cleansers, according to the American Academy of Dermatology: apply the cleanser to a quarter-size spot, twice a day for 7-10 days. I tested it on the underside of my arm, near my elbow. Apply a normal amount and rinse as you would usually do, according to the directions on the product. If you don't have any reaction, go ahead and use it."

She removes makeup like a charm, cleanses the skin and tones so it cuts out multiple other products I was using and it doesn't irritate my skin or burn my eyes! Literally the only cleanser that has never burned or irritated my eyes. I have used soy cleanser for years, left and tried others, but always go back to it so I think I'll stay for a while. I just purchased her again and had to come share my love for it. Just so obsessed! Highly recommend!!!"

This product, while incredible, does not justify the expense. The amount you actually need to remove the makeup as advertised does not make this product a value size, especially at the new price point, and absolutely does not justify spending a $100 per purchase. The regular size is more like a mini/trial size and wonu2019t last you long. The mini is basically a one and done. I will be visiting other cosmetic stores to find my new cleanser. This is not good business, coming from almost two decades of customer loyalty."

I used yo buy all the Fresh face masks, this soy cleanser and several of the Black Tea products. First they started creating smaller quantities for higher prices. I still bought them. Then they started filling them only partially full. Now this new, inferior formula? Itu2019s not horrible and I didnu2019t have an adverse reaction, but, itu2019s just not giving me any fresh, clean, dewy skin and brightened up eyes. Such a shame! I loved this brand. If youu2019re looking for this original soy cleanser please be forewarned that the new clean products arenu2019t worthy of your precious coins. Sad."

Waste of money, cleans nothing, and yes there is such a thing as too gentle which this cleanser is.

Whenever I've used this cleanser in the past, it always did an amazing job of cleaning all my make-up off without stripping my skin and it just left my skin feeling calm, clean and not too dry...now it feels like it barely cleans anything at all and if you want to get a good clean, you have to use a large amount of product to get any sort of lather.

I have oily skin that is pretty sensitive and haven't had any irritation, redness or breakouts. Maybe it's because this isn't a traditional soapy or foamy cleanser, it's a nice cool gel that is very gentle. I like to massage it onto my face for a minute or two before rising off. I use a separate eye makeup remover to get my mascara off but I like that I can use this to gently clean the eye area again to get any last traces off. I use this twice a day, since I have such oily skin, I have to wash my face in the morning and this works perfectly to clean and prep my skin for the day. My skin is soft and the oil reduced without being tight and dried out. Overall this is worth the price for me, it is more expensive than I'm used to but worth it to me. Give it a try!"

I was finally at a point where my acne was mostly better thanks to my routine, but I would still get a buildup of whiteheads under my skin and during my cycle they would erupt into painful cysts without fail.  I tried this cleanser as a sample about a month ago and since starting with it, my whiteheads have greatly reduced. While I did still have a few spots during my cycle, they were little surface level pimples that cleared up in a day or two instead of painful lumps that take weeks to heal. I will say that I experienced a bit of redness at first that cleared up in a day or two and that I have to work a bit harder to keep my skin hydrated, but it is also winter. Also, I could definitely see how the smell might not be for everyone. It has a VERY strong cucumber extract smell. But all in all, the reduction in my acne makes those minor complaints well worth it."

The texture is like a transparent jelly which foams up whilst working into my skin and rinses off quite easily. Despite the claims, it isn't the best at removing makeup, and I usually need to use my DHC (or other) oil-based cleanser first, before using this if I'm wearing anything more than foundation and concealer. Mascara has no chance! The ingredients are for the most part, very natural and beneficial. This is one of those cleansers that feels like it's contributing to the health of your skin, rather than taking anything away. I do find it pricey for what it is, but considering the ingredients, the glow I get when using this, and the 'simple yet elegant' tube packaging that I love having next to my bathroom sink, I definitely plan on re-purchasing this one once it finishes.   ~ My Sephora Top 7 must-have list ~  (My top 7 must-have beauty products of all time, focusing mainly on my purchases at Sephora)  1.

Gentle gel formula, doesn't irritate my skin, not drying but still cleanses well, foams just the right amount. One of the things I love most is that it removes all of my makeup including eye makeup without stinging. This is huge because I am way too lazy to use a separate product to remove my eye makeup. My skin has been so calm and clear since using this. I left the house without makeup this morning after about a week and a half of using this, which I never do. I am a product junkie and I'm always switching things up, but I've tried so many cleansers and I think I'll stick with this one.

It does not linger once you rinse it off. love the fact that I can wash my eyes lids in the morning time and experience zero stinging/irritation. I've went through multiple bottles of this product. I am so glad after all these years that fresh has not changed the formula or any of their ingredients. Although I've ventured out to other face washes but nothing has tends to provide me the same satisfaction as the fresh soy cleanser. I've tried fresh milk cleanser once which is okay as well. Maybe I will try there milk cleanser again come the winter but however I can use this gel cleanser all year round without any issues. I personally do not like spending a lot of money for a wash off product but it is something about this product that I really enjoy. I do not wear heavy make up so I can not speak upon the effectiveness for removing make up. Honestly you just can not go wrong.   *I've purchase this product with my own funds.

My dermatologist was okay with me continuing to use this cleanser despite the changes we made with some of my other products.  I also always leave a bottle of this cleanser in our guest bath because it feels luxurious and special and it is gentle enough for all skin concerns.  I am never without this cleanser and I even stock smaller bottles of this product for travel.  By the way, the larger size lasts me for months so it doesnu2019t even feel splurge-y at $38.

I have quite dry skin on my face, and had tried many other gentle cleansers before finding this, and have also tried others since when I've tried to find less expensive cleansers or gotten free samples, including the Drunk Elephant, First Aid Beauty, Cerave, and Cetaphil ones, which I know work well for others but for me just almost instantly made my face feel tight before I could even get my face moisturized post-cleanse (and then like thirty minutes post-moisturizing it would start to feel tight and dry again). Not saying that those don't work for a lot of people but just that if you've experienced issues with other gentle skin cleansers this could work for you!  I especially love that I can use it over my eyes. I do a couple times a week use it after an exfoliator (Lush's Let the Good Times Roll, sorry Sephora)."

However, I find this is very drying on my skin, and that is what matters to me most, so will be returning. I have better options from Sephora (Purity cleanser, Fulvic acid cleanser) that seem to work better on my skin, so I'll stick to those."

I had purchased a gift set of about five fresh items including the face wash and a toner so I dove in expecting tight skin from the wash. But I got soft skin! What a shock! This could not be true not on my skin that has always been like a prune. I carried on with the toner and moisturizer and felt divine. I tried again that night thinking it had been a fluke and same thing. Soft skin! This little tube lasted for a full month and I finally replaced it with a full size. I expect it will last at least six months so do not let the price of the Fresh poroducts sway you. You only need a tiny amount. As an added recommendation, when using the toner with the roses I would suggest pouring it directly into your hand and then patting it onto your face and that way you will waste far less product than if you pour it into cotton. I intend to purchase that next but hoping it comes on sale as I intend to get the large bottle and I will need more cream by then as well argh it never ends."

It helps my redness, calms my skin, and gives it a nice glowy, supple, hydrated look. The gel formula feels nice and it has some sort of cool feeling and a fresh smell to it, although some people say it smells bad, I like it.

If you have this issue as well, try a gentle cleanser (like this one) and treat the acne, pores, oiliness, etcu2026,with separate masks, spot treatments, or exfoliators.   This cleanser is great because it washes all the grime and muck off my face, makes you feel fresh and hydrated after rinsing, and for me, personally, has reduced my oil production significantly.   If you donu2019t want to commit to trying the value-size bottle first, buy the trial size so you can give it a test run.

It gets my skin nice and clean and removes sunblock and mascara and light foundation/tinted moisturizer (I have not tested full coverage foundation). It doesnu2019t strip my skin or irritate and dry out the dry spots in my combination complexion. It has a great slippery texture that allows you to put it strait to work in your face without having to wet your face or lather the product. I just wet my hands a little. It is pricey! I initially purchased it with a gift card which is why I splurged but now Iu2019m addicted. I use it 5-6 times a week as my main (morning/night) cleanser and I use about a nickel sized (sometimes quarter) glob. If you have drastically combination or dry skin I recommend you try it. My dry spots are very dry and my oily spots are very oily. It seems to prevent blackheads and whiteheads really well. Itu2019s worth it especially at the sale price."

I also noticed the frequent comparison between the soy face wash with some makeup-removal-only products. Whichever face wash you use, double cleansing is the foundation of skincare. Soy face wash is pretty much a face wash that can effectively remove a small amount of remaining makeup, just like any other face wash. You will not see this product perform well solely as a makeup remover; Get a makeup remover with this product. This is one of the best face washes you can find from the market regardless."

Always make sure to double cleanse!! I use an oil based balm to remove my makeup, then follow up with this to ensure everything (oil, sweat, dirt & makeup) is removed. The cleanser does not burn my eyes, which is huge considering my eyes are extremely sensitive and I have bad reactions to a lot of fragrances in skincare.  The cleanser will leave you feeling supple and hydrated. It does not strip, if a cleanser strips your face, get rid of it. The price is hefty but you definitely donu2019t need a lot to use. It foams easily and goes a long way.   Fresh has 25% right now and I think that anyone wanting to try this cleanser just needs to do it because itu2019s amazing and is great for anyone!"

I use this in the shower to remove makeup and/or just to clean my face after a long day along with my silicone face scrubber.  This takes off my Tarte Lights, Camera, Lashes mascara after just a gentle scrubbing, whereas a regular makeup wipe would take longer and require more rubbing.  I will say though that if I have a full face of makeup on (foundation, concealer, eyeliner, mascara, lipstick, etc.), I will do a double cleanse or use a makeup removing wipe prior to make sure it is all off.  It also has not caused me any issues with skin sensitivity nor does it make my eyes burn.  This also has not left my skin feeling stripped or dry, it leaves my face feeling smooth and clean and has not caused me to break out.  The cucumber scent can be a little overpowering when you first start to use it, it literally smells like you're rubbing a fresh cut cucumber on your face, but I don't notice it much anymore.  I purchased the 5.1oz tube in October 2020 and still have around half of it left after around six months of daily pea-sized usage, so I would say its worth the cost.  I was previously using The Ordinary's Squalane Cleanser, but I feel like this one does a better job overall."

I have extremely dry/dehydrated skin and at the time that I purchased this I had a head cold and my nose was completely raw and dry with flakes from it.  Gross,  I know, sorry.  But what impressed me so much is that whenever I used this product, almost immediately,  the tip of my poor nose was now soft and all the flaky skin vanished.  MIND BLOWN.  My skin is often dry and flaky and this cleanser makes my face so smooth and I never get that tight feeling, however, it does a pretty efficient job of cleansing away any makeup etc. Or at least breaking down hard to budge mascara/eyeliner.  I also like that this doesnu2019t foam up a ton.  Itu2019s a nice jelly consistency with a light froth but nothing over the top.  My skin has transformed and this is only after using it for less than one week!  Best cleanser ever hands down."

I always double cleanse in the evening to wash off makeup, so I have no idea if this would work for that purpose by itself. I have tried a bunch of other gentle cleansers trying to find a replacement, since this is so expensive for a product that you wash off, but none of them are quite as nice.

I have struggled with acne my entire life and have sensitive skin too, so it has been challenging to find a cleanser that actually cleans my skin without irritating it or drying it out.  Previously I used Purity Made Simple or Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser. Both are good, but didn't clean my oily pores enough, especially during the summer months.  The only downfall of this product is that if can be drying if you  don't moisturize properly. In the winter months, for example, I had to switch from a lighter moisturizer like Caudalie's Sorbet moisturizer to Biossance's Omega Repair. I also incorporated nightly face oil into my skin regimen.   Additionally, this product doesn't always effectively remove stubborn eye makeup and rubbing it vigorously along the lash line can irritate the skin. So, what I do is remove eye makeup with Drunk Elephant's Slaai Cleansing Bomb, then wash my entire face with this product."

It will get rid of any makeup residue missed by the cleansing oil.  I do love the smell (a strong rose scent with cucumber) as it reminds me of a luxurious spa experience, but it could be toned down a bit.

I donu2019t use any heavy or waterproof make up (only CC cream, tinted blush, and sometimes eyeliner), so this product is ideal for me. However, if you use waterproof make up, I saw some people complaining about its make up removing properties. You may want to consider that before buying it.

It also clogged my ores and made me break out. I got fed up and threw it away within a week. It had a weird sticky, tacky, gel-liquid texture that I was not happy about. After looking at the ingredients, I realized that it has glycerin (which doesnu2019t clog pores and is a humectant to add moisture, is good for sensitive and dry skin, but also gives products that tacky texture), several (too many in my opinion) different oils (sunflower oil, castor oil, & soybean oil), and silica (which is essentially silicone-it can get into your pores and clog them and cause break-outs)."

I love that it is very gentle, very mildly lathering, skin feels clean but nourished and not overly stripped. The smell is nice of cucumbers and very mild. I usually use a cleansing oil before to get rid of makeup, but I think this cleanser is effective and gentle. I would definitely purchase this again, it's also great that it has the clean seal. Price is a bit on the upper side for just a cleanser, but it is a large bottle and will still last a while. I would totally recommend it."

They are now rare but still hormonally noticeable at times. But, the soy face wash wasnu2019t helping anymore so, maybe if you have dry skin this is the way to go but if not it simply isnu2019t effective for you.

I'm used to creamy (Saturday Skin) and foamy (Neogen) cleansers, and some oil ones (like Purito and Boscia). This was neither an oil or foam. It felt more like slick snot on your face for lack of a better description. It didn't foam up. It just was. I did like that there was no residue and it rinsed off very nicely I am a fan of Fresh's other products I've tried, but this cleanser isn't for me. I dropped a star only for my personal distaste of the texture. I'll continue to use up my mini, but won't repurchase. It did do a wonderful job removing impurities from my skin without drying it out."

One use of this cleanser completely undid all the work into getting my skin into shape.  I am so frustrated and angry right now.

It doesn't leave mt skin dry AT ALL. It doesn't overly strip my skin, but when I go in with my toner afterwards, I don't find any dirt leftover. However, do note that I do NOT wear any makeup! So, how this does taking off makeup, I don't know. But, for people who dont wear it, I'd recommend this product! I do have Combination skin, so those who have very oily skin may not see the same results as me."

I love natural products so I give it extra points for that. I have good skin for the most part. I don't need alot of sophisticated cleansers or deep cleaning for my face. This face wash is perfect for on the go people. It's not too cleansing and something in it is slightly acidic maybe so it kinda exfoliates your skin. But it doesn't leave your skin with that squeaky clean feeling. It leaves your skin relatively mate all day long. Even I've worked many jobs where I walk around alot and sweet and cleaning etc. Ive worked alot in kitchens for example. This cleanser will hold you over when you feel I don't have time or motivation to properly cleanse my skin. Even when I wear makeup after cleansing my skin is still mate many hours later. It's also a great makeup remover. Good for taking to work or maybe the gym etc. I highly doubt you'll regret buying this product. If you doesn't work for you I will almost guarantee you a friend or family member will love it! Five stars all the way."

And while Iu2019m often skeptical about whether you get substantial results from ingredients like soy and aloe (in a wash-off form especially), this product offers a sufficiently thorough, gentle cleanse that leaves my skin feeling hydrated and supple. I like this cleanser--quite a lot, in fact. But: nearly $40 for 150 ml is easily more than double its worth. And I think Fresh has attempted to justify this productu2019s high price point by advertising the cleanser as this 3-in-1 cleansing makeup remover with toning effects. Itu2019s a cleanser, and a really lovely one. But be wary of this makeup removing face wash advertising: it is not as effective a makeup remover as a balm, cream, or oil, and so I find this product best used as the second part of a two-step cleansing routine. And as for its effects as a toner--I would assume that the productu2019s inclusion of rose and cucumber is for the sake of its (divisive) fragrance more any reliable outcomes in balanced skin. If this product were $15, then weu2019d be talking; but I wonu2019t be spending $38 on a cleanser when I can find excellent alternatives for less than $10."

So this can be used to clean off mascara and liner from the eyes without irritation.  For a cleanser to be that strong/effective yet so gentle that you can literally get it in your eye without discomfort is miraculous.  Overall though skin appears advisably cleaner after use, it leaves skin looking so fresh and glowy.   I would strongly recommend trying this product.    With that suggestion I'll be honest that I've tried numerous face masks and scrubs by this company and have not been impressed or repurchased any other item in their line except for this face wash---it's that special.

People love this cleanser...but I don't get it?  It's not a BAD cleanser. It doesn't leave me feeling dry or tight after washing my face, but I'm now wowed by it. It feels fairly clean but I will say that it's not the best at getting any remnants of makeup off like most cleansers do in a double cleanse. Also, the smell is not something I'm a big fan of. I almost gag when I first squeeze the product out of the tube and quickly wash my face because of the scent.  I know many say that this cleanser is great for all skin types, all the time but this was no good for my combo skin in the winter. I had to switch to a much creamier cleanser based on my aesthetician's suggestion. For the price of it, I think you can find a better cleanser elsewhere."

It is super gentle, and has this gel-like texture so you don't have to rub your face intensely to get the product spread around. It has a really lovely rose-cucumber scent as well, not too in your face but just enough for a nice experience. It does not leave my dry skin feeling stripped in any way after use.

The packaging description claims an extra-gentle gel cleanser that instantly whisks away everyday impurities and makeup... without stripping the skin of essential moisture.' It'll take off makeup as any cleanser would, but it's not especially targeted as a ~makeup remover~ would be. As a face cleanser, it does the trick beautifully, which I always expect from Fresh. It spreads well without foaming and skin feels refreshed afterward. It's a pleasant experience and a little goes a long way. However, when it comes to cleansers, I think you have to do a lot to justify this price -- and while it's a good product, I don't think it's worth paying extra from drugstore cleansers unless you have especially sensitive or acne-prone skin that responds well to it. So! 3-stars for delivering on the goods but not quite being worth the cost."

But come on itu2019s 2020 letu2019s get some makeup remover and do the double cleanse! Also this will NOT sufficiently tone your skin (depending on your skin type). This cleanser is not drying by any means, but if youu2019re a little on the drier side, and you just skip your toner thinking that this is really a 3-in-1 product, your face will be uncomfortable.

This product doesnu2019t irritate my acne-prone skin at all and does an amazing job at making your face feel clean but not stripped/tight. It has a slimy consistency (not as weird as it sounds) which turns into a gentle lather and a subtle fresh cucumber scent (not overwhelming). I know itu2019s a bit pricy but itu2019s worth it.

I'm constantly faced with pretty packaging (like Tatcha products) and have fallen victim to over-hyped products. Amy educated me with this one. It cleans my face without stripping it. I suffer from dry skin and severe eczema. After washing with this cleanser, my skin didn't feel as tight as it usually does.   I'm also wondering if my skin issues were triggered by makeup and sunscreens not effectively washed off, leaving bits of residue BEFORE this product.   Very happy with this!"

My favourite part of this cleanser is you can use it on your eyes - important to me because a facial cleanser should be used on your eyes too (are your eyes not part of your face??). If a face wash has chemicals that sting the eye, that concerns me, but this removes everything without making my skin uncomfortable! There is a light cucumber scent and the feeling after rinsing it off feels like my skin is already toned and prepped for moisturizer. I highly recommend this as it worked great for me."

After I took my lashes off there was still lash residue. I wet my face like it said, over my makeup even though it felt weird and wrong, then took 2 pea sized amounts rubbed it together in my hand and then rubbed it on my face. It took almost all of my makeup off. I washed my face one more time with another 2 pea sized amounts, and it got all of my makeup off, including the lash glue residue and waterproof mascara I was wearing. My face feels smooth and fresh after washing my face. It's only been a week since I bought this and I don't regret it at all. Seriously best face cleanser ever! Highly recommend!!!"

To me itu2019s not the best because I donu2019t find it very effective in terms of makeup removal, bang for the buck, and consistency is a little too jelly like for me.

I couldnu2019t believe how soft it made my skin.   Fast forward to the present: I keep a tube in the shower and one by the sink. My husband who suffered from terrible cystic acne as a teen and occasionally as an adult has been using this and last month I noticed his acne scars didnu2019t look as pronounced as they used to and that his skin was so soft and clear! He loves it, I love it and I hate that I didnu2019t find this sooner!

I mainly continued to use this product because I found that it didn't cause any breakouts - BUT it never controlled any breakouts either. It simply just helped to clean the surface of my skin without any irritation. It's so gentle that it was even the perfect cleanser for my eyelash extensions without interfering with the retention of the glue.   Moving forward from today, I will no longer be using this product in my everyday skin care regime. I've had skin concerns like acne scarring and hyperpigmentation for a long time and have FINALLY decided to move on from this product as it no longer fits my skin care needs (or my college student budget)."

I double cleanse and this is my second step after using dove bar soap on my face. I use this with my PMD clean cleansing brush and overall I experience far fewer breakouts, my face feels clean and my complexion is more even. My skin has done a complete 180. One of my favourite things about this cleanser is that even though it is very gentle, it gives my face thorough clean. I apply this directly onto my eyes to remove eyeshadow, liner and mascara and it gets everything off and never burns my eyes. Plus, I use this cleanser twice daily and I find the 150 ml tube lasts me about ~5 months."

It was as if I had gotten a weekend full of 8+ hours of sleep, when in reality it was half that. As I continued to use it, I continued to see soft and supple skin. This was especially great because I use chemical exfoliators regularly and the weather here is super cold and drying to the skin. I canu2019t thank her enough for recommending this, and I canu2019t recommend it enough for everyone else. Thereu2019s a reason this has a huge following! I now use it nightly paired with a chemical exfoliating wash for the daytime and my skin looks better than it did in my 20s."

I just received this cleanser in my BoxyLuxe this month and decided to try it out and maybe switch up my routine since I'm running out of my other cleansers - and I've paid the price. My skin immediately started to sting when I used this after my oil cleanser, and although it states it will take off all of your makeup - even mascara - I used The Ordinary's glycolic acid toner afterwards and STILL found traces of my foundation on my face. It's been about 10 minutes since I used the cleanser and my face is red and blotchy and feels really tight as if its drying out like a prune. So glad I didn't pay full price for this product.. would not purchase on it's own. I'll give it a few more tries before I toss it out. Disappointed is an understatement since I've read such great reviews."

I switched cleansers and pared down my skincare routine to bare bones and the breakout went away. Then I switched back to this cleanser because it DOES leave a nice texture to dryer skin, and my breakouts started immediately again within 12 hours. I stopped using it after that one time and the breakouts have gone way down. I'm not typically someone who breaks out either. Please keep this in mind if you have sensitive skin.

Iu2019ve been using this cleanser for a few months now and my skin has been so supple, soft, and feels hydrated even before I apply anything else.   I recommend using this and then a gentle scrub or exfoliant followed by the fresh Black Tea Kombucha Facial Treatment Essence before applying your serums, creams, and moisturizers. If you have sensitive, dry, or combination skin, you canu2019t go wrong with this as apart of your daily regimen.   Sidenote: I had already bought the mini size cleanser in a Fresh set from Sephora and was actively using it when I received a complimentary deluxe sample from Influenster, so thank you for the extra supply because I was already smitten and about to go purchase the full size tube!   *I received this complimentary for testing purposes."

It is truly a great gentle, every day cleanser that hydrates, nourishes, soothes, and protects the skin, and is appropriate for all skin types! The gel texture is extremely gentle, especially in the delicate eye area. The soy cleanser provides a deep cleanse and is tough on makeup, without the after effects of drying out or stripping the skin. The cleanser effectively removes all traces of mascara, eye makeup, dirt and debris. Skin is left looking and feeling hydrated and refreshed. It is fragrance free, however has natural scent of cucumber and rosewater extract. While the price of may be a bit of a sticker shock for some, little product is required per use. 150 mL tube is generously sized and lasts a long time. Def will continue to purchase. I received this product complimentary for review from Influenster."

It is a bit pricey but I received this product as a free sample and the size of the squeeze bottle is quite large. I can see it being a staple to my skincare routine but because of the price I probably wouldnu2019t purchase it regularly. As for ingredients, they are relatively safe. Some reviews claim that the soy cleanser has parabens - not sure if this is true? Iu2019ve tried to look into this and donu2019t recognize any ingredients as parabens but then again Iu2019m not an ingredient expert nor did I take the time to look up every single ingredient.

The gel cleanser is easily and evenly spread onto the skin and a little bit goes a long way. After using this for the last few weeks I have not experienced any breakouts on my sensitive skin. The only issues with the cleanser for me are the price and the smell. I find it to be extremely pricey and it smells terrible.

It is a simple tube with a snap cap and comes in a clear, gel form. The fragrance gives me cucumber and soy, which I found refreshing and not very strong, but if you're sensitive to either of those, just be mindful. This was extremely  gentle on my skin which is on the sensitive side. It didn't lather much, but it did leave my skin clean and not stripped of moisture. I had my boyfriend try it after he got sunburned to wash his face, and it was extremely gentle for him as well, while still cleaning his skin. Overall, I think this is a great option for those who have sensitive skin, or simply prefer a gentler but still effective facial cleanser."

My second favorite thing about it is that it is gentle enough to be used on the eyes. I have never once felt my eyes being burned or irritated by this product. My first favorite thing about this is the smell. It smells so fresh and fruity, but doesn't linger enough to irritate. I use this every day and it makes my skin so soft."

I learned my lesson and have only been using a pea size amount since. My blunder just goes to show you how effective this cleanser is.  The scent is also quite nice. It smells very fresh and clean, with a hint of cucumber, which I found to be very soothing. Although packaging doesnu2019t affect how effective the product is, I do appreciate the simple design, and easy to use squeeze bottle.  As a side noteu2026I love the fonts Fresh uses on their packaging! I canu2019t be the only one who loves a good font.  Although it is a gel base, its super rich and a little does go a long wayu2013so the value is great! After washing it off with water and patting my face dry with a towel, I noticed that not only did my skin feel clean, it felt soft. I have never used a cleanser that made my skin feel like I had already put my serums, moisturizers etc. on it. With other products I have found that my natural oils have been drawn out, which isnu2019t a huge deal breaker for me, as I put oils on my face anyway, but the Soy Face Cleanser preserved my skins structure, whilst cleaning out any impurities.  *Gifted Product*"

Like fresh cucumber in combo with other freshness... a little goes a long way and it is safe for Eyes to remove makeup.. thank you!   It takes very little to wash my face and eyes.  My skin feels very clean afterwards.    My skin always feels a little tight after gel cleansers and this one is no exception but I do adore it and will for sure use through the summer.. getting off all the makeup and sunscreen etc.. this is just fantastic.   My skin feels invigorated.   I've been using this along with the Sugar Strawberry exfoliating face wash which is also excellent.    They both make me excited to cleanse my skin which is a win.

Well, that's good! No irritation whatsoever.   Every after use, my skin really felt soft and smooth. It really left my skin fresh and not stripped of moisture. I've not put on mascara these past few days so I can't tell yet if it would be helpful in removing it, but I've put on CC cream, foundation, powder, blush, and they've been cleaned together with dirt.   I kinda was looking for the soapy, bubbly feel when I massage my face but this formula isn't. It just feels slippery when you massage it. It's also a plus because it doesn't have that strong scent. Instead, it gives the calming scent of of cucumber."

I love how it's a low-foam formulation and actually feels nourishing on the skin. Only bummer is my skin (that's already sensitive) feeling some burning with the face wash. It doesn't burn the eyes though, so that's a huge plus!! Immediately after using, it was a little red but it didn't feel dry at all, great for us dry skin folk! I didn't notice any radiance or immediate smoothness after using. So far, I have incorporated it into my routine as a morning cleanser when my skin needs extra nourishment. It's not great at removing makeup but as a morning cleanse or second cleanse, it's great and gentle. Warning though, if your skin is experiencing some irritation from other sources, avoid using this product until the irritation goes away. I'm thinking it's the fragrance that's irritating my skin. Also, I received this product for free for testing purposes."

I LOVE the latter but as my skin has started aging and winter weather feels more harsh than usual, I find that my skin needs something more gentle and moisturizing. I wear a full face of makeup almost everyday which, I've always loved PTR because it washes all the make off effortlessly, but I've found it can also leave me a bit extra dry when my skin is just tired and dehydrated. The Soy Face Cleanser is the perfect alternative for those days. It does take a bit more effort to take off mascara and liquid liner, I would suggest using maker remover or oil to help remove the makeup. Otherwise, I love the fresh scent, cooling and hydrating feel of this cleaner. Plus this tube will last me most of the year."

It removes makeup very well (it would make a great first step in any double wash regimen), helped even my skin tone, didnu2019t smell like chemicals, and was gentle. Unfortunately, several years later, my skin started breaking out again, so I switched to a different oil-free cleanser. Regardless, I highly recommend this cleanser if you have dry, sensitive skin."

I am not saying that it worked a miracle, because I have experienced issues with my skin for a long time and do not expect one product to change that. However, the day after I started using this cleanser I saw a big difference! My pores felt clean, and my skin tone was even. I also noticed that while it worked well do help with the pimples on my face,  but it did not dry or irritate my skin! It does smell like cucumbers, but the scent isn't too strong.

I tried it for about a month and some change and I just didnu2019t love it. It didnu2019t make me breakout or anything but I never felt like it really dug deep down into my pores and cleaned my skin. I always felt like this product sat on top of my face instead of actually cleaning my face. Not only that, it never gave me a glow. I only continued to use it because I loved the consistency and the smell didnu2019t bother me; however, once I ran out, I knew I had to try something else because this wasnu2019t it.

After using, my face feels clean and fresh--it takes off layers of sunscreen and makeup, and is gentle even on the eyes.   It's not a 'makeup remover' per se, so I usually need to use a separate makeup remover if I wore heavy makeup that day for a night out or fancy event, but otherwise it does a really great job of taking off street makeup that I wear to work and leaving my skin clean and residue free.  It doesn't lather, it's more like a gel, so know what you're walking into, and that you need to rinse thoroughly. I use it morning and night with none of the sensitivity issues or overdrying that I've had with other cleansers. Blackheads and oil is controlled well with this.  The Sephora write up also cites that this addresses fine lines and wrinkles and loss of firmness--I didn't notice an uplift on those, which is my only disappointment. That being said, since it's very gentle and not highly drying, it's probably not harming your skin, where some of the harsher cleansers would cause harm. This wasn't a high priority for me in my cleanser. I correct for this in serums and moisturizers."

My skincare routine was amazing but there was always one thing that bothered me, the dryness of my skin after cleansing. The previous cleanser I was using worked really well with acne but it completely dried out my skin. So, I decided to switch to this one and of course with the sample size first. It is so gentle and it cleans my skin without drying it out. It is worth the largest size and works for all skin types as it says but, works the best with dry and/or sensitive skin.   For advice, I really recommend cleansing in circular motions and really get in there. It helped get rid of the small bumps on my forehead and it allows the rest of my skincare products to work and sit really well on my skin.  This is my only daily cleanser that I use both morning and night, and after removing my makeup. I hope this really encourages you guys to buy this because it is totally worth the money.

The smell is amazing (I canu2019t wait to wash my face in the am and pm!), the gel consistency feels like it really cleans out my pores as the second step in my double cleaning following my farmacy oil cleanser, and it has not caused me to break out or react at all. Itu2019s really hard for me to find products that do all of these things, but I have found my dream cleanser indeed! I will repurchase this again and again and think this will always be my go to cleanser for irritated, dry, and red skin. Buy this-you will not regret it all!"

It's gentle, smells refreshing (like cucumbers), cleans my face well, and gets rid of any leftover makeup I have on. Although, I do use makeup remover wipes before washing my face if I'm wearing makeup.  It seems to get all the excess dirt and oil off my face. Unlike some other cleansers I've tried, the soy cleanser has never made me break out. The only downside, in my opinion, is that this face cleanser doesn't foam up at all, which I prefer because then I can see that I've cleaned all the parts of my face thoroughly, but oh well."

This is definitely one of those Could be better but could be WAY worse types of things. To start, the second you open the lid the scent of cucumber overpowers you. This might not be a problem for some people, but I personally don't like the smell of cucumber. It claims to be able to remove all of your makeup gently, and if by gently they mean not at all then its correct. I had fallen asleep with my makeup on so when I woke up my mascara had given me raccoon eyes, the cleanser couldn't even fully clean that up off of my cheeks.  Though it does to really well as a daily cleanser. I use it while I'm in the showers in the morning and it acts as a really nice pick me up for my skin to start the day. It also did help me clear up some of my acne. I just don't reccomend using it to take off your makeup."

Itu2019s a gel-like formula, not messy at all, smells wonderful (similar to Fresh Rose Face Mask just not as rosy), and my feels SO clean! I have combo skin and this works perfectly for me.

Itu2019s great for daily use both morning and night, but I tend to use it more in the morning and use a slightly more heavy-duty cleanser at night after taking off my makeup. Itu2019s also great for more sensitive skin, and its use can range from using on more dry days to more oily days. Thereu2019s not much scent which is also nice if fragrances arenu2019t your (or your skinu2019s) thing! Slightly pricier than other cleansers but fairly middle of the road at Sephora!Overall great cleanser!"

I must've got a bad batch I told myself. The product didn't clean my skin well. I couldnu2019t understand why so many people loved this cleanser. The product was ...weird. Thatu2019s the only way I could describe it. Didnu2019t clean my skin and scent was overpowering.   Few months ago, on a whim I bought the full size product. Everyone raves about this product so I wanted to give it another try. And I'm glad I did!! I have completely changed my opinion. Holy grail! Gentle cleanser - soy proteins, rose water, cucumber extract - not foaming! Which I love. Ph level 5.3 - perfect!! Hydrating - does not strip the skin - a repurchase for sure. Not a good makeup remover thou. Use as a second cleanse. Every person should own this cleanser. I think a good price 38 for a 5 oz bottle."

Since I switched Iu2019ve noticed my skin was less dry and I stopped having breakouts. Itu2019s definitely not a cure for dry skin, as I still have issues, but itu2019s helped a lot.

I have very dry skin and a lot of u201cgentleu201d moisturizers tend to dry me out even more. This has done the complete opposite! I can finally say I have found my holy grail cleanser!!  Side note I was skeptical at how small the travel size is (thinking it wouldnu2019t last long) but I bought it 1 week ago and use it night and day and still have over half the bottle left. I would suggest going for the smaller size as a starter!"

Consistency: - Goes on smooth, really easily, glides on your face, almost like KY Jelly on a metal device for an ultrasound.  - It's not too thick, not too liquidy. - Doesn't foam or lather which is fine this allows you to control it and doesn't dribble into your eyes like some other cleansers. The formula glides and sticks to the face.  Smell: It was pleasant, like fresh cut cucumbers, it wasn't chemically it was nice, kinda organic. It didn't match the packaging and would picture this may sell better if it did have some mint green type of color or cucumbers on the package.  - The scent was only there when I was cleansing my face. As soon as I washed it it came off.  Feel: - It didn't burn my eyes. Some cleansers feel like chili when you rub your eyes to get the last mascara residue off this was nice. - It left my skin feeling balanced. Clean yet not dry.  - Did not leave a film or residue - Did not dry out my face - It did a great job of removing makeup much better than my Algenist.  Overall I really liked this cleanser and would continue to use it."

I'd 100% recommend this face wash, cleans well without leaving your skin dry and yet also helps your complexion with brightening and seems to calm any breakouts you have."

I have very oily skin on my t-zone and I wear a heavy makeup routine day-to-day (eyeliner, eyeshadow, mascara, foundation, etc) but my skin is easily irritated and dried-out by typical drugstore cleansers and makeup removers, even wipes. Because of this, one cleanser is usually never enough so this one didn't do the trick there, so I usually remove a lot with a cotton pad and baby oil, and then I rinse and massage this soy cleanser into my skin to remove the rest and it leaves my skin feeling fantastic. I follow up with moisturizer. For me the price is worth it because it's a perfect step 2 cleanser that doesn't irritate or break down my skin barrier."

I'm loving this cleanser because it gently yet effectively removes all of my face makeup (moisturizer, primer, foundation, setting spray - the works), and it rinses away very easily and quickly (not like other cleansers that seem really 'soapy' and take awhile to rinse off).  I use it by squeezing some cleanser onto my palm, adding a little bit of water, then rubbing for a couple of seconds til it becomes a light lather. I then massage it onto my face for a minute or so, then rinse.  I do use a separate remover for my eye makeup, but accidentally got some of this cleanser in my eyes and it did not sting! OMG"

Although I'm a minimalist when it comes to makeup, it did seem like this did a good job removing my concealer, lipstick, and even mascara. My only wish is that it left my face feeling a little more hydrated when I was done using it. It certainly didn't feel like it stripped my skin at all, but it just didn't seem as moisturizing as some other cleansers I've liked.

From what Iu2019ve read from other reviewers it seems like this was common if you have dry skin. I stopped using it and kept everything else that I normally use the same and my face isnu2019t breaking out anymore. Again it was a great cleanser to take off make up and really make my face feel clean, but obviously the breakouts werenu2019t ideal. Iu2019d recommend getting a sample first if youu2019re considering or the smaller size (glad thatu2019s what I usually get when trying a new skincare product).

Iu2019d be nervous about using this regularly as Iu2019m concerned it would strip the skin of some essential oils too and possibly make acne worse.

If anything I noticed that my acne got worse while using this cleanser. As soon as I went back to a tea tree cleanser, my skin started looking better within 2 days. I also really disliked the smell... I know this works wonders for most people, but my skin did not get along with it. I now use the first aid beauty cleanser and that helps with makeup removal, and keeps my acne at bay."

I didn't really see any improvement in skin tone or texture, and my acne didn't clear up any better with this cleanser compared to my favorite Clean n Clear drugstore cleanser. I just bought my third bottle of this, so I do enjoy it as a makeup remover, but I definitely need to use other products to control my skin. My favorite use for this cleanser is when I travel (which I do a lot). This cleanser is so gentle and kind of bland that no matter what stress my skin goes through because of travel (dehydration, lack of sleep, lack of access to my entire skincare regime, etc) this Fresh cleanser won't make matters worse. So, I guess my final verdict is that this is a good cleanser, but don't expect it to be a miracle product."

It really does a great job and feels amazingly fresh. On days I wear little or no makeup the cleanser alone is enough. For a full makeup I do cleanse with oil first and then this and it works wonders in getting rid of the oil and residual makeup. I can say with confidence I will repurchase again."

I have redness prone skin that can get dry in some areas but I also live in high humidity/100 degree area so finding a good cleanser that doesn't strip my face has been hard. My only complaint is that I hate the cucumber smell...but as I only have to endure it for 15 seconds I'll put up with it. I know it says it removes makeup but if I've got a full face on I ALWAYS use a wipe (ole henricksen) before washing my face to get most of it off and leave the soy cleanser to actually clean my skin."

I do like the cleanser and I wanted to love it but it has a hard time removing basic makeup. I had to scrub my eyes to get my eye liner off... and who wants to scrub soap into their eyes? no one. I have used other cheaper cleansers that have worked better.. like the FAB beauty cleanser. that one leaves the skin soft and clean. The Fresh cleanser leaves your face soft but doesn't do a good job of cleaning, so I can imagine pimple are soon to come if I keep using this. The texture is weird"

I heard so many good things on YouTube about it and I tried the mini size version to see if I would like it.  The scent is refreshing and wakes me up in the morning. Also feels like it really gets in there and washes any dirt,oil, and excess makeup off my face. The only negative thing I would say about this is that on my combination skin it makes my face dry. But thats why we have moisturizer."

As for the clean factor, I felt that it DID cleanse my skin, just not as well as other cleansers in its category. 2 of my biggest gripes with this cleanser are itu2019s smell, which for me personally was potent and pungent, and the texture. It felt like a combination between jello/shower jelly combined with freshly harvested seaweed. I couldnu2019t be happier to get this off my face. I really wanted to like this cleanser as some of the FRESH products I do enjoy, but sadly this one is not for me!"

My skin always feels clean (removes makeup very well) and does not irritate it. The jelly consistency is fun and the light smell is lovely. The large size lasts forever, so the price is WORTH IT.  Overall, great year round cleanser for most skin types. It has made my skin look good. 10/10 would recommend to my friends, and even my enemies."
