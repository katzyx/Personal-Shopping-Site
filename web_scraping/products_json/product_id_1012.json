I have tried Nars, CT for colour correction, layered with other concealers, and this does the job of two products, brightens, colour corrects and conceals. I use it with the Sephora 02 concealer brush, perfect shape to pat under the eye area, then go back wit a teeny dot only on dark circles, the brush to me is extremely helpful in applying this concealer flawlessly."

Its goes on i would say a good medium coverage, it does not crease for me except slightly under my eyes which is very normal for me and i would say this creases less than I am used to.   Its looks glowy but sets down well and powders look really pretty on top. I do have combo skin than leans dry particularly in the morning and have semi acne prone skin, this covers breakouts well for a full work day, but it will cling to major dry patches if you have any area that may be lifting. Overall this is well worth the purchase."

I chose a color that was a bit too light for my skin tone, so I tried it as a regular concealer and also to give brightness to other concealers. I ended up returning it based on the color alone after trying to make it work for a month even though I like the formula!  PROS: I loved the serumy texture and it's easy to blend with my fingers or a sponge. The first layer gives medium coverage and is buildable, but it doesn't quite become full. I prefer this in a concealer, but it's not for people who want FULL coverage. It only needs a bit of powder to set. It feels lightweight with a satin finish and it still looks like skin!  CONS: It has to be blended quickly because its stays stuck in place since it sets down as it dries. I have to use an eye cream before, or else it can emphasize my under eye fold. I can only use a small amount of powder or else it gives it a dry textured look.  Overall, it's great formula for the price and it's not the formula's fault that my eyes are so dry."

This isn't a concealer I'd use on blemishes tho, doesn't really work for that. Also, this isn't a concealer you need to wait before blending. It dries pretty quickly so I wouldn't let it sit much before blending. blends great with fingers, brush or sponge. It's kind of becoming one of my faves.

I love how luminous it looks; gives you that u201cyour skin but betteru201d look that we all strive to achieve. And it does a fantastic job of covering my extremely dark under eyes. Highly recommend this concealer! My only gripe is that the shade I selected matched my skin tone perfectly-which isnu2019t awful but I like my concealer to be lighter than my skinu2014and it doesnu2019t appear that there is a lighter shade that would match my skin; I have a cool rosy undertone and am quite pale. This is not a deal breaker for me though, because the formula is a win and since it did match my skin, I will use it. I just hope they add a few more shades to their range in the future!"

I had no issues with it accentuating my dry patches or am I fine lines. I am over 40 and recently have been struggling with hormonal acne as well. This product last all day I donu2019t find that it creases and it stays put an over 100u00b0 weather. It can be used under the eyes and all over the face and it holds up well. I love that this is a affordable concealer but feels like more high end makeup! I definitely recommend this for all skin types itu2019s very creamy but not overly creamy where it would cause oiliness on oily skin. I think itu2019s suitable for everyone! My only complaint about this concealer is the applicator. It has a bent tip and because of that itu2019s a bit difficult to get the wand inside and out. It gets stuck as as itu2019s going in and out!

And the concealer I was previously using was making it worse. So a beauty influencer recommended if you are struggling with dry under eyes use this. At first it was fantastic! Though I did struggle to figure out how to blend it out. My fingers didnu2019t really worku2026 and so I used a damp beauty sponge and I thought it blended nicely but I had to add another layer because you could still see the dark circles under my eyes. I was primarily wearing it when working inside so it looked great. But I remember one of my coworkers pointed out I had really bad sunglasses marks. I went to a mirror to try to fix it but it just made it worse. I tried waiting longer to put my sunglasses on, making sure I had powder and setting sprayu2026 but the make up would be gone from where my sunglasses sat no matter what. Then finally I had to work outside in the summer heat and oh boyu2026 it looked like an oil spill on my face. It looked so cakey, it completely separated and it emphasized my fine lines like crazy - I looked 10 years older. I tried wearing the concealer without powder didnu2019t help, less moisturizer eye cream didnu2019t help, changed my setting spray and still looked terrible once sweat and humidity hit my face. I guess the journey for the perfect concealer continuesu2026"

Looks like my skin but with a glow (like a healthy glow)     Cons:  -packaging sucks (getting wand out of the container) -wand doesn't dispense a lot of product, so I have to go back into the container for more -oxidizes. The undertone of the product doesn't change, but it oxidized to like a shade or a shade and a half darker on me. So the first 10-15min of me wearing this product, I look like I am wearing the wrong shade.   -if I use too much, it can get cakey/heavy. So literally a little goes a long way.    I bought MN3, which oxidizes to like MN5, when I was paler than even my Winter shade. SO now I find that it is too light for me. I will buy TN3 or TN6, which would be my regular shade, in the fall.   I found the perfect match in the concealer, but not in the foundation which sucks as I really like the medium coverage and finish of the foundation. Overall, best make-up product I've tested/used yet so 5 stars!!!"

The packaging is super cute and sleek, but I agree with other reviewers that the opening is too small for the applicator and you have to be very precise taking the applicator in and out. I also agree with others that this is not a full coverage product like the description claims.  I personally like the consistency and the finish, however, because I don't want a hardcore full coverage concealer around my eye area or to highlight/brighten certain parts of my face. I use a more matte and fuller coverage concealer if I need to spot conceal acne or redness because this product is not for that, but I like the pretty finish it gives me around my eye area and brow/forehead area for highlighting.  The formula is creamy and gives a medium coverage natural looking satin finish that doesn't settle into fine lines. If you are a tarte shape tape type of person, this aint it for you, but this is a great concealer for those who want a natural medium coverage dewy concealer."

I do set this product with powder, as it dries a bit tacky, and then it doesnu2019t crease on me.

This is also not for all-day-into-night wear because it can dry to a bit flaky/crunchy after several hours, and I do not have dry under eyes.  I only recommend for under the eyes, not spot concealing because it is not full coverage.  This is great for a school day or work day, casual looks when you want to look fresh and not look like you simply rolled out of bed.  Maybe an online presentation, meetings, running errands, and the like.  This is not for a formal memorable event because it is not glamourous.  It applies smoothly; excellent easy texture to work with, no off-putting scent.  I do not know how buildable it is because I do not pack on product, but the undertone dries down seamlessly.

I get that 'my-skin-but-better' look which for me is amazing because I have so many blemishes and acne scars. So to be able to look like it's my natural skin but without all those imperfections? Yes, yes please.   Now let's talk about application. This formula feels buttery smooth as you apply - almost silky like and it's so easy to blend. It doesn't cake no matter how much you use and you get a beautiful dewy finish. It's so lightweight on your skin; like wearing no make up at all.

They are either white, have a yellow tint or are too dark overall.  This concealer not only matches my fair skin and cool undertones, but it also feels like an extension of my skin as opposed to feeling cakey and heavy.  It is lightweight, creamy, easy to blend, and feels hydrating even on my dry skin.  Best of all, throughout the day it doesnu2019t crease or settle into my pores and fine lines.  I primarily use the concealer to brighten my under eye area and mask dark circles and purple veins but it also works to conceal blemishes and redness all over the face, too.  The curved applicator makes the concealer easier to apply, but it makes it difficult to get the applicator in or out of the thin tube.  My tip is to gently and slowly pull it because if you try and force it quickly, you may bend the applicator or waste product."

The tube is also pretty large and bulky considering the amount of product inside. Itu2019s a good concealer, just not as good a value as the price implies.

I got both light medium neutral shades that will do well for concealing spots on my face, the Mn1 is okay under my eyes but I like to go in with something lighter in the inner half to brighten my hereditary dark circles. The concealer is lovely, blends well into the skin and doesnu2019t look cakey under my eyes (I am 57 so this isnu2019t an easy thing). I set the concealer directly under my lower lashes using PMG Labs under eye setting powder. The end result is perfect, just need to get my hands on one of the lighter neutral shades for brightening my inner under eye area. My only complaint is the packaging, the package itself is attractive but the opening is small and the doe foot applicator is slightly bent to make application easier.the result is that it is hard to get the doe foot back into the bottle without forcing it, I feel like I am going to break the applicatoru2026itu2019s that bad. I used to love the Melt Flex Concealer, but the packaging was horribleu2026the little ring on the bottle that removes excess off the applicator always fell off, and not just one bottle but every bottle that I bought. After numerous experiences with concealer pouring out the bottle when I tried using (and ruining numerous outfits as a result) I just quit buying it since they never fixed the issue. I hope that LYS reads these reviews and corrects the packaging, otherwise my love affair with this new concealer will be short lived!"

I ordered LG3 which claims to be for fair skin neutral tones, come to find out (after I already ordered it) that is for warm tones. Needless to say, it was too dark for me. I was supposed to order LN3. The packaging is super pretty, but the wand is flimsy, and the doe foot is too big for the tube. Unfortunately, I cannot recommend this concealer.

Secondly, once applied it hardly looks like I have any concealer on. Even with two layers, the coverage is extremely subtle. It might be better on a no foundation day. If I were only using concealer it might work, but even then it would probably still be too light. I even choose two shades lighter for a better brightening effect. However, no brightening and hardly any color.  Lastly, although it's a hydrating concealer it still clung on to dry patches. Apart from the Jaclyn Cosmetics and Elf matte concealer, I've never had a concealer do this.   And one last thing, the wand is flimsy and cheap-like. It feels like the plastic part of a plastic q-tip. It's also a bit rough when inserting and removing the applicator. I'm also considering returning this because I gave it two tries already.  I reviewed and tried this concealer. Just search for lovekeebuu LYS concealer on Youtube."

The formula is thin and lightweight but the coverage is medium at best and, whenever I tried to build it in order to cover redness or dark circles, it just emphasized texture and looked dry.   I'm very fair with a cool undertone and the lightest shade has a warm golden undertone so I bought the next one up, LN3, which has a neutral undertone; unfortunately it's about 1-1.5 shades darker than my skintone.   I tried this concealer multiple times, with primer (Tatcha liquid Silk Canvas & Good Molecules Silicone Free Priming Moisturizer) and without; with sponge and brush (Sonia G Classic Base, which is made for creams/liquids); and it always just looked cakey and dry.  **For reference, my best foundation matches are MAC Studio Fix in NW10, Estee Lauder DW in 1C0 Shell and YSL All Hours in BR10.  To those looking for a full coverage option, I highly recommend Dior's Forever concealer, just know that the lightest shade, 00, is only available on Dior's site, labeled for some reason as a universal brightener."

It's so lightweight that it doesnu2019t even feel like i have anything on my skin. this concealer is perfect to use on both no makeup or makeup days! it doesnu2019t look cakey or crease at all. coverage is buildable and blends easily into the skin, so blendable, blends like butter leaving a natural skin-like finish. it's full coverage but doesnu2019t feel heavy or look cakey. it covers my dark circles very well and itu2018s long lasting! the formula is just very smooth and creamy and feels great on the skin. i love that this contains amazing ingredients such as Hyaluronic Acid, Watermelon Extract, Turmeric, and Ashwaghanda. i really appreciate the skincare infused ingredients. this feels hydrating and moisturizing and brightens up my skin leaving it looking flawless. a little product goes a long way, and i love that the wand grabs a lot of product, so you don't have to redunk your brush multiple times. i like the shape of the wand however I have issues with pulling it out and putting it back in the bottle; the opening is too tiny, and the wand is long and thin. but other than that, the concealer itself is amazing and i am very impressed. an amazing concealer quality wise and price wise. i love the shade range also! i love that LYS is cruelty free and vegan and i love what the brand stands for!"

The formula feels lightweight but it provides a good amount of coverage. Because it's so lightweight, it doesn't look cakey or crease at all. The finish is skin like as well. It stayed looking good all day too.   I am shade MG5 in the foundation, and I received shade MG5 in the concealer. The concealer is ever so slightly lighter, but it's basically a perfect match to the foundation, so it's great for spot concealing. In the future, I would like to get a lighter shade to brighten my under eye area.  The only annoying thing about this concealer is the packaging! The triangle packaging matches the overall vibe and aesthetic of the brand. Practically, the packaging is annoying. It's very, very difficult to get the wand out of the tube. Sometimes, it flicks out some product and can make a mess. I'm always scared it's going to flick concealer on my clothes. It's also quite difficult getting the wand back into the tube, since the wand is so thin and the opening is so small.   If you can get past the packaging, this is a VERY good concealer, so still 5/5!!"
