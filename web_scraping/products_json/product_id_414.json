I've bought this product three different times, and once you think you've run out, just leave it upside down, and there will be a lot more to use, I lasted another three weeks on it once I remove the little plastic thing on to the top of it."

I'd say if your skin is very prone to acne and your pores easily get clogged stay away.  If not, enjoy bronze and glowing skin that lasts the whole day."

			"review_text": "I saw so many amazing reviews online, so I couldn't resist trying this product. Sadly, I was disappointed and will not be repurchasing.  D-Bronzi does not work well if you wear sunscreen. First, I tried applying this (mixed with moisturizer) before my sunscreen. But once I put on my sunscreen, it smeared the D-Bronzi around and made it look uneven. Second, I tried applying it after my sunscreen, but it turned out really patchy and did not blend well. (I tried this method when mixing the D-Bronzi with moisturizer as directed and then without moisturizer, because moisturizer on top of sunscreen is weird. The D-Bronzi and sunscreen combo did not work, either with or without mixing it with moisturizer.) Third, I tried mixing it with the actual sunscreen, but it came out patchy again. I tried these methods with 3 different facial sunscreens and it still turned out uneven or patchy. On the rare occasions that it looked fine with sunscreen, it would melt off/smear around my face after about an hour (presumably due to the formulations of sunscreen).  If you're not wearing sunscreen, this product looks great when first applied to the skin (mixed with moisturizer) because it gives a pretty, tinted glow. However, its effects do not last very long. After a couple hours, the color begins to fade. I've worn this for short term events, like going out to dinner, and it was just fine! But this is not something that you can wear all day to work or school and expect it to look good for more than a couple hours.  I will not be repurchasing this product. It does not work with any sunscreen I own (which I wear daily), and it doesn't last very long. I've found other bronzers that work well with sunscreen and are longer lasting. I'm sure there's some combination of moisturizer and sunscreen out there that works well with this product, but I am not going to experiment and change my entire skincare routine just to accommodate this one product, especially if I can find better substitutes."

Although, this product is on the cheaper end of the Drunk Elephant line I still do not think it is worth the money.  I also do not see how this could help solve for uneven texture, dark spots or loss of firmness. Maybe it does work for anti-aging because of its oily makeup, but I’m not going to be using it long enough to confirm that claim!"
