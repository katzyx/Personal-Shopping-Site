I used the recommended nickel-sized amount and then blew it dry.  I got a little bit of volume, not a ton, but then the next morning my hair was clumping together and wouldn't lie smooth no matter how many times I brushed it.  Usually I can get 3-4 days out of a blow-out, but not this time.  Maybe this is great for people with other, thicker hair textures, but for me this was a fail.  Also, very strongly-perfumed, so beware.  Not a bad scent (herbal), just strong enough to compete with any other scent you might wanna wear. I'll be sticking with Color Wow Xtra Large Bombshell, which does the job much better without any clumpiness or scent!"

It was very light and easy to work with, and because it was so light it made it easy to coat the hair. The scent was not over powering which made it nice as well.  I did find that it left a residue on the hair that felt a bit off no matter how little I used. However, it did leave my hair feeling nicer after using heat styling so I would use it for that. The thickening aspect wasn't super impressive even after days of use but it was there."

I already use dry shampoo, hairspray, teasing, and a root crimper just to get a lot of volume at the roots. I was so excited to try this. It doesnu2019t leave your roots greasy, or crunchy. But I really do notice a difference in volume and also hold of that volume. I donu2019t have to touch up my teasing when I use this. Itu2019s really a great addition to my routine."

            "review_text": "Iu2019ve been using the Virtue Flourish Thickening Styling Treatment for a few weeks now, and I am thoroughly impressed with the results. As someone who is always on the lookout for products that can add volume and thickness to my hair without weighing it down, this treatment has been a game-changer.  First and foremost, the consistency of the product is perfect. Itu2019s lightweight and doesnu2019t leave any sticky residue, which is a huge plus for me. I apply it to damp hair, focusing on the roots, and then style as usual. The difference is noticeable almost immediately. My hair looks and feels fuller, with a natural lift that lasts all day.  One of the standout features of this treatment is its ability to nourish and strengthen hair while providing volume. My hair feels healthier and more resilient since I started using it, which I attribute to the high-quality ingredients Virtue is known for. The scent is also lovely u2013 fresh and clean, but not overpowering.  I also appreciate that this product doesnu2019t leave my hair feeling stiff or crunchy, which is a common issue with other thickening treatments Iu2019ve tried. Instead, my hair remains soft, touchable, and full of movement.  Overall, the Virtue Flourish Thickening Styling Treatment has exceeded my expectations. Itu2019s a fantastic addition to my hair care routine, and I highly recommend it to anyone looking to add volume and thickness to their hair while keeping it healthy and manageable."
