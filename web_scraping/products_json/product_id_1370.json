The thicker texture is so pleasant to apply. This is definitely not a product for sensitive skin but on my combo skin it did turn a little red and sensitive for a day my first use and I made sure to apply sunscreen but the redness went away pretty quickly and I was able to see results right away."

The texture is also very sticky which isn't the greatest. It does work though: it exfoliates dead skin, it makes your skin glowy. I like that's packaging too, it's in a pump so it's more hygienic. But I find one pump dispenses too much for my face (my face is on the small side) so I usually use half a pump. It also comes with a piece of cloth to help physically exfoliate too which is nice. You can't really use it without a cloth though because it's just much easier to remove it with one. I've been using it for a year and it does work, but I'm not repurchasing. I'm going to look for another chemical exfoliating mask that smells better, but works just as well. If I can't find one I'll definitely come back for this one."

This one is just right - I definitely feel a difference in how my skin looks and feels after I use it, it does tingle slightly for the 10 minutes I have it on, but it ultimately doesn't cause any irritation. Yes, it feels like you are slathering on marmalade. Yes, it smells a bit weird (I actually don't mind it, it smells a bit orangey to me) but the smell doesn't linger when you wash it off. I also love the dispenser because it's way more hygienic than a jar, and of course, as always, love the clean ingredients. My skin just loves this brand!

I will continue to purchase this and use it as part of my skin care routine. Some reviews have mentioned a terrible smell and I strongly disagree, it has a kind of funky papaya smell but it is really minimal and you barely notice it. Plus the benefits greatly outweigh the smell by far! I used it for the 10 minutes instructed but I think I could leave it on my face for a bit longer. I didnu2019t feel any discomfort so Iu2019d be interested in seeing if leaving it on longer does a bigger impact.. bottom line I highly highly recommend this stuff itu2019s awesome!!!!"

I was not too familiar with the line REN but with the glowing reviews, I thought I would give this a try. My thoughts; I am 40 and take excellent care of my skin. Recently got some darkish scarring from 'picking' at my skin around chin area. Tried this mask and after rinsing thought it was worthless and I was disappointed as it did not leave my skin soft like other masks (though I realize there is no instant miracles) . Then I woke up and exfoliated the next day. My skin looked beautiful. I have used it 2 times now ( 1x weekly) an noticed my skin looks more even and pores less clogged looking. 4 stars bc the smell is Not pleasant at all but really who cares if it does the job. Price is also reasonable compared to other products I have tried that don't do anything. Definitely worth trying!"

Even their Glow Tonic is more harsh than this is. After 15 minutes on my face, my skin felt so glowy and refreshed. Even hours later Iu2019m in awe of how nice my skin looks!

I experiences some slight itching and a very,very mild tingle but I feel more tingle putting on GlamGlows black mud mask or PTRs pumpkin enzyme mask (both of which I absolutely love!). I left this one on for a little over 15 minutes. My face was not red at all. A slight flushed glow would be a better description. After going through the rest of my nighttime routine, I definitely feel my skin is firmer. I am pleasantly surprised. I think I like the PTR pumpkin mask slightly better because it also contains a physical exfoliant and it is much less expensive (plus smells like pumpkin pie) BUT Ren is a very nice mask too. I may purchase this eventually, once my other peel masks run out."

Pores werent so....hello you doin'? Skin looked a lil more brighter and those unwelcome guests....well they were reduced in size and feeling a lil dry. I plan on sticking to the once a week rule but will use the toner from the same radiance line to act as a supporting actor....to maintain the results. So even though its just my intial response to first time use I'm truly impressed. Hope they dont change the formula or retire it from the line."

Iu2019ve tried everything you can imagine to help my skin. This product is a miracle. When I first started using the mask, it made my skin very dry afterwards but I think my skin was adjusting to it. I left it on for 10 minutes and it made my skin dry and flakey the following week. The second time, I only applied it for 5 minutes, this was the magic number for me because my skin wasnu2019t as dry. I recommend you try using it for less time than the 10 minutes if you find it makes your skin dry. Each time Iu2019ve used it, my skin has gotten smoother and more glowing, and less dry. It is helping my acne scarring and the texture of my skin is so smooth now. My makeup looks flawless now. I also believe this mask prevents acne - Iu2019ve barely had a single pimple since using this mask. It makes sense that it would prevent acne because it removes the top layer of skin and the dead skin cells that clog your pores. I highly recommend this mask! You wonu2019t regret your purchase."

The smell is also quite nice (it's sweet and citrusy), and I don't find it to be drying.   I must say though, don't rely on this mask alone for exfoliation, you'll need to slough off dry spots with an exfoliant later in the week. Reading other people's reviews, I was shocked to see that they were experiencing tingling. I exfoliated with belief mild and effective scrub first then applies this makes, and I think my skin is more receptive to it this way. Even though I do tend to have sensitive skin I wouldn't recommend this method for everyone. I've also experimented with leaving this mask on for upwards to two hours, and my results were pretty good.    I suppose I was expecting immediate results, which I didn't experience, but I like how gentle this peel is."

I prefer this over any standalone glycolic treatment because glycolic acid can draw moisture from your skin causing it to be dry. With the lactic acid combined with it, it helps draw in and keep moisture so you get the best of everything! Lactic acid is a humectant, so it draws moisture from the air to keep moisture in your skin. I honestly don't think I could find a better mask that I could get today in Sephora. The ingredients combined with the weight of the product (not too thin so it doesn't move too much or thick so it doesn't glide enough) and the cloth it comes with to remove it, that actually works surprisingly well, makes for an entirely pleasant experience. I can't speak to any other claims since I don't fight with really anything other than minor texture, so I can't comment on anything other than the glorifying texture reduction!"

As I approach 27 though, & since moving back to the desert, my skin needs a little oomph. I found this to be a good exfoliator, gentle enough for a newbie, & non-irritating (for me). It does smell a little bit like orange Flintstone's vitamins, but it's made to be rinsed off so eh. Those who are used to serious chemical peels might be underwhelmed. While it makes my skin smooth & glowy, I do use a charcoal mask after to get at blackheads it hasn't done much for. Overall glad I purchased, but might go for a slightly more multitasking product like the Algenist micropolish next time so I don't have to use multiple masks."

Cane and Cane daily peel in 20% is a game changer. I used it daily and sometimes twice daily for 4-5 months. I have no more hyper pigmentation, no visible pores, no fine lines and my skin literally glows. Maybe because I am not a newbie to a strong lactic or glycolic product I didn't get the results from Ren Radiance Renewal Mask as I hoped for. I am going to add it to my weekly regimen though."

I got a mini sample from Sephora on the last haul I got and decided to give it a try. Left it on for 10 mins then washed it off, oh wow my skin has never looked this way before. I mean it's so soft and bright like I was 10 year younger. Also I suffered a bit from a crazy Halloween make up last week which had broken my skin very badly but this mask is truly a life saver (I also use the Origins Charcoal mask first before applying this mask though). Bottom line, If I could only use one mask for the rest of my life, this would be it. It works for me and sorry if it doesn't for somebody else. The only negative thing is the price. :("

It's a decent exfoliater, it makes your skin smooth but it doesn't help fade acne scars and just adds more acne and acne marks for me to deal with.

I leave it on a little longer than directed, around 30-45 min and wash it off with a warm cloth. My skin has never looked better! I will forever use this mask. Forever!

I've used it 1-2 times a week for about 5 weeks now and haven't noticed a difference in any of the acne scarring I have on my jaw. As far as the exfoliating factor goes, the cloth that it comes with is really what's working for taking off any dead skin.

The next day I was amazed how my skin was glowing, I have just turned 50 don't look like it and would like it to stay that way.

I use it at night and my skin always looks better and more clear by morning. It's slowly been helping with the redness that comes from very mild rosacea, it tames break outs and my pores are hardly noticeable now and have noticeably shrunk. It's not a miracle product and you need to be patient to see long term results, but if you have sensitive skin, it's what you need and it's totally worth it. I gave it a 4 because it's my first exfoliating mask that I use once a week, so I don't feel experienced enough to say it's the best of the best. BUT, if you give it time, it works."

She told me that the difference between the two products is that the Origins dermabrasion product will actually irritate and spread bacteria around more, possibly causing more breakouts whereas this one has fruit acids that will eat up the dry skin. I bought it and went home and tried it and in one try all the flakiness on my forehead and around my nose was gone.

I don't find that this product leaves any residue on my face, but it is left feeling clean. One thing I did notice, is that when I leave this product on longer than 15 minutes, it tends to leave my face slightly orange after rinsing. This product is meant to brighten and add radiance, but that is one thing that I have not found this product to give me. Unfortunately, I will not be repurchasing this product."

It's possible I didn't rinse well enough because my breakouts were all around the edge of my face but even then, I didn't expect a product to break me out so bad. The pimples aren't the normal kind either, they are so huge and so deep! Nodular acne. I'm so sad because with this type of acne, it could last weeks before the bumps subside. If you have slightly oily, acne prone skin tread carefully with this one."
