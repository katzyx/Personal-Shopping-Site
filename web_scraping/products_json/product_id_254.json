            "review_text": "I absolutely love this fragrance. Initial spray scared me with a screeching citrus but almost immediately turned to a realistic grapefruit. Just a couple minutes in I got a white floral that had almost a coconutty note to it and quickly changed to a clean jasmine. The dry down on me is jasmine, orange flower with a splash of fresh citrus. I only get a faint touch powder. I would describe overall as a easier to wear version of Chloe edp. This falls somewhere between Chloe and Love Story Sensuelle."
