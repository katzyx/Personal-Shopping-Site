Covers well - I would say it's medium coverage with natural-matte finish. It's also very comfortable on my sensitive skin - I found this on a best of list for sensitive skin. I'll keep using this for everyday. KVD good apple has also been working well for something fuller coverage and also not irritating."

As soon as I brushed it on, it looked chalky and did not absorb into my skin. I let it dry and tried to apply another layer for better coverage and my brush simply moved around the makeup already there because it didn't absorb correctly. I use Tatcha primer. Also, it did not darken, but actually dried lighter, making it look even chalkier.By the end of my teaching day, the only blended  makeup left on my face was my concealer, which looked really weird with the chalky film that stayed put. I'm sticking with my all-day Makeup 4Ever HD Skin."

I am very active and my products have to not only look great in person and on camera but also perform and wear well. This foundation works great with the brand's primer and plays well with other products. I apply with a damp Beauty Blender. I really don't understand why people aren't loving on this more! When selecting a shade, be sure to shake well, try a few shades and really let it dry down and set so you can see the true color."

As others have mentioned, it is difficult to match yourself to the correct shade online. I bought Sunlight which was the correct undertone but a little bit too light. For reference I am the shade C2 in MAC f&b.  2- not full coverage. The product has a hard time adhering to itself since it is so thin which makes it almost impossible to build up in coverage.   3- hard to get an even application. Again, because the product is thin certain areas have a hard time making the foundation cling to it...for me that is around my nose. That being said, certain areas on my face gather too much product and the foundation looks cakey (around my mouth).  4- not dry skin friendly.   5- great mixing foundation to thin out other formulas. I love mixing this with the Nars Sheer glow for a more sheer and natural finish.   6- no smell and great packaging.   Overall.... not a must have. Because I bought this on sale at 50% off I will keep it, but I would not buy it at regular price."

I am fair with a sometimes confusing neutral undertone.

I wouldnu2019t consider this full coverage, but definitely builadabl with a nice natural matte finish. I do also love the cleaner ingredients! It does not break me out or irritate my skin at all. My oils do tend to break through after a few hours though (which I personally donu2019t mind) but keep in mind if you are very oily."

Not a full coverage foundation (clearly a marketing tactic) It is buildable to a medium coverage at best. If you have redness/discolouration it will even out your skin tone somewhat. If you have dark spots/acne marks/freckles NO, it will not cover those. You will need to go in with a concealer.   Now in terms of performance, it is great for normal to oily skin. Gives a natural/matte finish. However, for oily gals like me, you need to set it on T zones unfortunately. But I won't complain, it is very lightweight. It's a your skin but better kind of product.   Again, not a full coverage foundation. But if you are looking for a light coverage light weight foundation for summer, 100% recommend."

I would say as far as longevity this lasted pretty well, 9 hours out and it still looks decent. My nose and chin are the first to separate and this was no exception, in fact this is one of the foundations that has a hard time sticking to those areas. However it also had the tendency to crack early on and Iu2019m wondering if it was too drying in itself. Early fall i had less issues with it than dead of winter on my combo to dry skin.  With a sponge the coverage is high medium, very lightweight on and when you shake well it still has an almost watery consistency. Bottle is a standard size for foundation but i would have preferred  a shade window on the side instead of a sticker, itu2019s very hard to tell when you get low due to the opaque packaging.   Overall while i enjoy this foundation i still reach for my ELDW if i want fuller coverage or long lasting. itu2019s just not as bullet proof on my skin type but maybe if you donu2019t have dehydrated or dry areas it would fair better .

Hope this helps.  In the photo I covered a part of my scar with it but I would still set this with powder as you can tell itu2019s very lightweight and natural finish. I did not get this for free."

Company focuses too much on branding and the aesthetic than it's actual product. Do not recommend."

If you have ANY dry spots...its gonna cling to it.  I have a like / dislike with this product. Stays on fairly well over time but also can cling and gather in some areas of the face such as the nose.  I wanna love it, but I think im just indifferent with this one.  To be fair my skin is going through somethings right now, but I also have used it for awhile.  Just cause it did not work for me 100% does not mean it will not work for you. I think it's still worth giving it a go if you are interested!"

I get the impression that this formula was made to be applied with a sponge or brush. well, I know myself, and I know my tools will never be clean, which is why I always use my freshly washed hands. but if you can handle the commitment of cleaning your brushes daily, by all means, apply this with tools. I bet a sponge would work great. actually.  I would recommend this, though for me, the application is a bit more intensive than my previously used product (a foundation stick by Pu00dcR). the coverage is impressive, though, and for me, it outdoes MAKEUP FOREVER and KVD foundation."

Super difficult to blend after it dries, which is almost instantly. I am normally oily but this foundation always looks so dry & cakey. I tried hard to make it work by heavily moisturizing and priming before application but nothing helped. I really wanted to love this because Iu2019ve seen some people rave about it. Perhaps it only works for a very specific skin type. I am oily/combination and it was horrible on me. Really clings to dry spots and breaks apart leaving uneven spots and patches throughout the day.

Considering how many foundations I have tried, chefs kiss to this foundation."

When I switched to my Artis brush (super dense bristles), it was perfect.  It did take me awhile to find my shade.

When I applied with a Beauty Blender sponge and stamped it into my skin instead, it applied BEAUTIFULLY, leaving a smooth, even, matte finish and perfect color match. What a difference! Glad I didn't give up on it. Iu2019ve read reviews about the small packaging, but the product volume is a very standard, 1-fluid-ounce size. That said, itu2019s medium coverage, so if youu2019re looking for full coverage (as itu2019s marketed), youu2019ll need more product to build to full coverage. From that standpoint, it may not be worth the price tag for some. Staying power is also medium; I use a loose setting powder and the Lawless Glam Guard spray, which help. Not a holy grail for me quite yet, but itu2019s definitely one of the higher-performing u201ccleanu201d foundations I've come across as a foundation junkie. Worth a try and Iu2019d repurchase!"

I did buy it on the 20% foundation sale, otherwise I probably wouldnu2019t have bought it because I did not like the Lawless u201cWoke Up Like Thisu201d foundation, but I can tell you that I would absolutely pay full price for this. To be honest, this is not full coverage at first pass- especially if using a sponge which I would not recommend. I used the NYX canu2019t stop brush and it applied light to medium. I did do a second pass and I was so impressed at how it then became full coverage without looking caked on. Now I do have dry skin and I love a natural finish, and thatu2019s one of the reasons I chose to buy this. It definitely has a natural finish but there is a dewy sheen and I really like it. Normally Iu2019m not crazy about overly dewy foundations but the finish of this is beautiful. Also, I have mild rosacea and it totally covered it up with the second pass. For primer I used the UD All Nighter primer but Iu2019m going to try it with the Supergoop Unseen Sunscreen and Glowscreen, which are my favorites. Iu2019ve seen videos on YouTube that have used no primer and it looked great, but I always always use a primer. All in all, my first impression is that this is a beautiful foundation that looks natural. Iu2019m happy I purchased it on the sale but when I run out Iu2019ll purchase full price."

For the price you get such a small amount, which I though my would be fine if it was full coverage. Considering it is at best medium, semi buildable (and thatu2019s ONLY if you know how to apply it and use the right brush). I used different types of application techniques as well. The only reason Iu2019m giving it 3 stars is because it does look absolutely beautiful on the skin once applied, and has no obnoxious scent, and dries down nicely. That said, though, they missed the mark big time for me. Itu2019s marketed as if this is the holy grail and itu2019s just a disappointment. Iu2019ll be returning."

I was very skeptical going into this review because this product is not my typical choice of finish/coverage. I was pleasantly surprised by the finish and coverage of this foundation. I was able to apply it with a sponge and that really lightened the coverage to medium. The finish was matte but didn't settle into my lines, although it looked like it was going to.  It wasn't drying on my skin at all and wore well the entire day without being set. I really liked this foundation and I would recommend it."

I am so glad I received it because it is such a great product. The shade I chose was slightly darker than my skin but I can definitely get away with it. I applied it with a brush and it went on beautifully. It was so easy to blend and it sets in so nicely. You can build it up if you want more coverage but for me one layer gave me great coverage. There was no need to apply powder to set it because it was self setting. Nothing I had ever seen a foundation do.  The foundation lasted all 8 hours that I had it on without creasing. I will be purchasing this product in the correct shade."

Itu2019s a medium coverage right off the bat but can be built up to more full if thatu2019s your preference. This sets itself so thereu2019s no need to apply setting powder.

Fortunately for me it dries down a little darker than it looks so I was able to make it work. It is comfortable to wear; very light with a liquidy consistency that makes it easy to blend. I felt this would be better for someone with normal to dry skin as I did have a bit of oiliness as the day went on and found myself patting it dry. I did not have any cakey spots or cracking whatsoever which is usually the kiss of death for foundations. It gives a pretty decent full coverage based on how much you build it and work with it. I did find the product to be a little small based on price but I realized that most higher end foundations are similar size. All in all itu2019s a good and comfortable foundation, but it would be optimal for someone with skin that doesnu2019t get as oily as mine so I will be saving this for use during the winter when my skin is drier :)"

The only con is that I noticed was that after about 1-2 hours there was creasing near my eye area.

I wore it out for an entire day and it did so well! My makeup applied well over it and, even with my drier skin, I didn't have any issues with oxidation, creasing, or patchiness.

I have also used their hydra base primer underneath and it works well with it . I also mixed with some of the skin base foundation for a day when I thought my skin needed more coverage . I was worried being 40+ that this might be too sheer but it actually lessened those fine lines . I will probably continue buying skin base foundation for days/ nights when I want a more matte look but this is a wonderful addition to the Illamasqua range . Absolute plus points for being vegan Beyond foundation Loving this product on my mature skin. Last all day. Doesnu2019t settle in fine lines and wrinkles. Skin looks lovely. Very hydrating. Trying to find best colours for me as there are so many shades to choose from.

It slightly reduced some redness from my acne, but did slightly emphasize the dryness. This would probably work better if I had a more moisturizing base. However, I wouldnu2019t try to layer it too much as it will look cakey. The foundation was fairly water resistant. I had some product left on the back of my hand and ran it under some water, but the foundation did not wash off or bleed. Would also say that this is mask proof, but it makes sense given that itu2019s lighter than typical liquid foundations and is water resistant. Overall, itu2019s great for someone who wants a lighter base makeup without looking like nothing is there. Iu2019d probably recommend this to those with skin on the slightly oilier side (I have dry combination)."

I also like the fact that it dries matte. I don't even have to follow up with a powder to set it. The only thing I wish was done was that there were no instructions or tips on how to use the product on the packaging. It would have been extremely helpful to know that you need to shake well before use, but that's not printed on the packaging and I had to go on the website to find out the right way to apply this foundation.
