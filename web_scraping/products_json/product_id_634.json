While it does come with an above average price tag, it was so worth the smoothness it provided for my makeup. My skin is often dull and in need of a moisturizer look - this primer helped to achieve just that! There was a nice glowy finish to it. Highly recommended to those who need a nice glowy finish to their daily routine."

            "review_text": "This product was my own purchase and not given to me by anyone. My skin is fair, sensitive, and prone to dryness and as I creep up on 50, has quite a few fine lines.  I first fell in love with this primer during a trip to Sephora.  A Guerlain sales associate had me try it (along with the Advanced Youth Watery oil which is lovely), and I was on the fence about buying it due to the hefty price tag.  Several months later, I decided to treat myself and ordered the serum. Great decision!  First, I love the packaging and the look of the serum itself.  It's one of the few products I like to leave out on display due to its prettiness factor. It looks so glamorous on the vanity table!  The smell is light and very delicate,  It's a bit more perfumy than any other primer I have tried before but I don't mind it. The product pumps out very nicely and a little seems to go a long way. When I first put it on, it felt thick and sticky but it quickly dried to a nice finish that I could work with.  My makeup up went on seamlessly and stayed looking beautiful all day.  I also like that I can wear it alone and it gives my skin a luminous dewy glow that has long since been lost! I would recommend this lovely Guerlain product."

I just bought another bottle and although that did hurt my wallet a bit, I KNOW I'm getting a really good product. It kind of sucks that it does not last longer .... but you only need 1 pump. I think this is going to be the primer I stick with! `"

You donu2019t need a lot. Itu2019s literally perfect in every way. Donu2019t be afraid of fragrance if it has never bothered you. The scent is immediate and dissipates quickly. Iu2019m a licensed esthi with sensitive skin and this has never broke me out or bothered me in any way. $85 is a lot to justify but I save up points, etc. once again it lasts a lot longer than others Iu2019ve used. Itu2019s fabulous. Canu2019t recommend it enough. And Iu2019m not a high end type of person. My absolute FAVORITE blush, bronzers and contours are $3. But Iu2019m telling you this primer is worth every penny. I NEEEEEED IT (SpongeBob water episode when heu2019s in Sandyu2019s enclosure, thatu2019s how bad you need it)"

I love the simplicity of the bottle and how it shows all the gold flakes.  But for the product itself, it didn't really work for me as well as i thought it would. The application is lovely, it's very lightweight and easy to apply. The only con is that it's not hydrating  enough and the flakes didn't really do anything when it comes to the finish. It had a little bit of shimmer but it wasn't really noticeable.  I would say it is a splurge and it's very pretty to display on your vanity but it's not something i would add on my regular makeup routine."

The packaging and bottle look sleek and high-end, while the gold flecks floating inside add an extra touch of beauty. Even the product itself is gorgeous to look at!  The primer has a gentle scent that makes the application process feel even more glamorous. What I loved most about it is the texture - it's incredibly smooth and non-sticky, which makes it easy to apply and blend seamlessly with a damp beauty sponge. It creates a perfect base for foundation, providing a flawless canvas for my makeup.  I used this primer with the Guerlain Terracotta Le Teint Fluid Foundation, and they paired together perfectly. The primer helped me achieve a smooth and uniform finish on my skin, and it extended the wear time of the foundation, which normally doesn't last me all day. With this primer, my foundation looked great from morning until evening, without any noticeable wear and tear.  I've used other Guerlain products before, and I'm always impressed by their quality. This primer is no exception - I would definitely recommend it to others and even repurchase it myself. It's worth noting that I received this primer from Influenster for free in exchange for my honest review, but my positive experience shows that it's a product worth investing in."

Firstly, the consistency of the product was quite thin and wet, which made it difficult to apply evenly on my skin. Additionally, there were unnecessary gold flakes suspended throughout the primer, which did not serve any functional purpose and felt gimmicky.  Furthermore, the primer did nothing to improve the appearance or texture of my skin. It did not blur my pores or smooth out my complexion, and it did not make my foundation last longer. In fact, I found that my makeup actually looked worse when I used this primer.  To make matters worse, the scent of the product was unpleasant. It smelled like a combination of hand sanitizer and Guerlain perfume, which was overwhelming and unpleasant to me.  Overall, I would give the Guerlain Parure Gold 24K Primer a 2 out of 5 stars. The thin, wet consistency, unnecessary gold flakes, and lack of efficacy left me disappointed. Additionally, the unpleasant scent made it a product that I would not want to use again."

On your skin it isnt boticeable except maybe 3 or 4 flecks that glitter. The primer has the consistency of a serum. After application my skin feels tacky and sticky - not silky smooth like other primers. I applied the guerlain foundation on top and noticed right away that you can see nore texture than normal - i don't know if that is from the primer or foundation. I will keep using it and maybe see if my opinion changes. But..there are better makeup artist quality primers out there. This is more of a luxury purchase."

Looks all those gold flakes flowing looks so glamorous and luxurious. The pump works smoothly distributing just the right amount of product.   I have combination skin, oily in the T-zone but dry everywhere else. I applied this over my usual skincare routine. Goes on smoothly, it has a bit of sticky feel at first but it goes away once it is fully absorb. The smaller gold flakes absorbed right into the skin, but the bigger ones just sat on top on the skin. Kinda looked weird to have a few random gold flakes on my face.   After application I noticed my skin feels more hydrated, looks plumper, smoother, more even and radiant. Saids you can wear it alone with or without makeup. I liked this on my skin without make up, gave me a healthy natural glow. But it didn't do much for me as a primer, didn't help with my pores or fine lines when my makeup was applied. I tired it with my usual liquid foundation, and tired it with the new Guerlain Terracotta Le Teint - Healthy Glow Natural Perfection Foundation, which was also gifted. Both foundation when on smooth at first but as I worked it in with my beautyblender, it dried and cling on to my fine lines, wrinkles, pores and dry skin. It might be because there is no silicone/dimethicone in this primer? My make up did stay on all day and didn't transfer. However I think this would work better as a primer for people who do not have problematic skin. I prefer primer which help blur out my imperfections.   This primer has a strong honey/floral fragrance that stays on even after application. It is too overwhelming for my liking. I do however love that this has 98% naturally derived ingredients and paraben free. I would still use this on non makeup days for extra boost of hydration and radiance, but not as a primer. I would recommend this if your concerns are hydration and radiance and you do not have sensitivity to scent."

It glides on smoothly without leaving any residue and provides a wonderful base for foundation. It is super easy to apply with a damp beauty sponge.  I used it beneath the Guerlain Terracotta Le Teint Fluid Foundation and they paired together perfectly. It allowed me to get a wonderfully smooth and uniform finish on the foundation and helped to extend the wear right to the end of the day. Normally I never feel like my foundation looks 100% by the end of a long day but using this, I felt my skin still looked great at nighttime when I went to remove my makeup.

The bottle is beautifully designed and has a really lovely weight to it. The product feels nice and I definitely did notice my foundation wore longer when I had this on. For reference my skin is dehydrated, which means that even though itu2019s super dry it also gets quite oily. One thing to keep in mind is that this primer is quite fragranced. It does go away, but if your skin is sensitive to fragrance it might not be the best choice for you. Now for the u201cwomp wompu201d news:  yes it made my foundation last longer, but my super inexpensive elf primer performed just as well. The takeaway: if you want something bougie to feel luxurious every so often, or if it is worth it to have the Guerlain primer, absolutely you do you!! If you prefer to save a little Iu2019d say spend on the Guerlain foundation and buy a drugstore primer to go with it. Thereu2019s definitely no denying that this one is beautiful!"

I have combination skin and some fine lines around my eyes and on my forehead and it did not break me out, and did smooth out those areas that foundation can settle into.  I also tried it on its own, overtop of my skin care but under my tinted sunscreen and I got compliments all day about having a glow! While it is not an absolute necessity, it does make a noticeable difference in the appearance of your skin and itu2019s something I will definitely keep using. Worth the extra step!"

The heavy glass bottle with gold cap and pump, paired with the suspended gold flakes throughout the primer, makes this a beautiful product to leave out on the vanity. The consistency of the primer is smooth and light, not like the silicone feel of other primers that feel heavy on the skin. The primer feels sticky as it is drying, so I made sure to wait for it to completely dry before putting my foundation over it. I have combination skin and felt like there isnu2019t a ton of hydration in this primer for my drier areas but it still creates a great solid base for foundation. I did not find this primer smoothing to the more textured areas of my skin unfortunately. I paired this up with Guerlain Terracotta Le Teint liquid foundation and was amazed that there was no movement in the foundation over the day, none of the foundation settled in my fine lines or creases, win!! The primer is scented, so that may not be your thing. The gold flakes are left on your skin after you apply which I didnu2019t love, but once dry, they can be brushed off easily or just covered with foundation. Overall this primer is not quite like any of the others Iu2019ve used, but it does the job wonderfully."

After using the product consistently for a few weeks, I am ready to share my thoughts on its efficacy, radiance-boosting properties, and compatibility with my skin type. The primer comes in an elegant 30ml gold bottle with a pump dispenser, which ensures easy and hygienic application. The packaging is not only visually appealing but also feels luxurious to hold.The primer has a lightweight, gel-like consistency that spreads effortlessly on the skin. The gold particles are finely milled, which prevents any chunkiness or grittiness in the texture. I used the recommended one to two pumps of the product and applied it onto clean, moisturized skin. The primer glided on smoothly and absorbed quickly, leaving a subtle, radiant sheen. The gold particles were not overly visible on my black skin, but they provided a soft-focus effect that helped blur imperfections. the Guerlain Parure Gold 24K Radiance Booster Perfection Primer did not cause any irritation or breakouts. It also managed to add some hydration to my skin, which is a plus for those with dry skin. However, if you have extremely dry skin, you might still need additional moisturization. Overall, I am impressed with the product. It provided a subtle, radiant glow, added hydration, and helped my makeup last longer without causing any irritation to my sensitive skin"

The gold specks are not quite evenly distributed, so I found that in different light you could see little specks here and there. Otherwise the primer filled in my pores evenly and provided a good base for foundation and bronzer without them feeling like I am caking on products. I have tried other better primers, so I am not sure that this one would become an every day product, more a splurge product for special occasions when I want more product on my face!

Soothes and heals the skin, essential for a flawless make-up. You can easily see the gold flakes in this transparent and gel-like primer. This extra luxurious gold primer was quickly and easily absorbed into my skin.  It has an amazing scent.  It has a very light consistency to fill fine lines and remove color inequalities. I liked its moisturizing and skin conditioning.  but don't expect a miracle.  I have to admit it is good enough as a primer.  It did not cause any irritation or side effects on my skin.  only the gold pieces were not evenly distributed on my skin and it had a flaky effect on my face.  So it did glow under the light.  I don't know, maybe this is normal, but it seemed strange to me as I don't use scaly products on my face.It can be great for those who use colorful and sequined makeup products.  It is not a primer that I can use every day, as I choose to complete my daily make-up with Korean-style natural and simple colors."

The texture is nice and it gave my skin a little glow, without looking oily. My makeup lasted just as long as it would with other primers that are far less expensive.

However, Iu2019m not sure how I feel about the gold flecks. I applied the primer and noticed I had tons of gold flecks/sparkles all over my face. I started to panic because it wasnu2019t like a glowy look, it was straight sparkle. The texture of the actual primer was very pleasant. It seemed a little silicone like but nothing heavy like a pore filling primer. It was a touch hydrating as well. It spread evenly on my face. Once I applied the foundation you no longer could see the gold flecks which I enjoyed. I wouldnu2019t have used it again if you could. I applied my foundation with a beauty blender and it went on well until I got to my neck. I noticed the product caused a little bit of piling on my skin. If you just dab with a blender you should be fine, but it might give you problems otherwise. I had paired it with a foundation from the same brand so I would expect it to mesh together well. So at the end of the day this wasnu2019t my favourite primer but it also wasnu2019t bad. It could be someoneu2019s favourite but I canu2019t say I would purchase again. #freeproduct"

I will probably be giving this product to my mom though as she is dry skin and it would work best for her.

I used 2 pumps and it fully covered my face and left a luminous, plump and hydrated appearance to my skin.   It held my foundation in place all day and didnu2019t have to reply any makeup.   I did use it with the Guerlain Terracotta Le Teint Fluid Foundation at first but didnu2019t like the way that foundation looked on my skin. After using this primer with other foundations I did love the results and how it make my skin look and feel.  The little gold flakes add a luminous glow to the skin and the formula is super soothing on my dry and sensitive skin. I would say it suitable for most skin types.   I will continue using this primer and am super happy with this product."

The main thing I observed with this primer is that itu2019s very sticky and takes a long time to dry. Longer than a silicone primer. I got fed up of waiting after a while and ended up applying Charlotte Tilbury Magic Cream on top as my makeup base. My skin looked great once I applied my powder foundation, nice and plump. I repeated the same process with La Mer SPF50 sunscreen on top, also works nicely without pilling. To me it behaves more like a skincare serum than an actual primer. I will finish the deluxe mini I got in my Sephora Luxe box, but I will stick to my beloved Murad Invisiblur Perfecting Shield SPF30 primer. Lu2019Or Gold Radiance is not transformative enough for me to make the switch, and the price is a little obscene for what you get. JMHO."

Since itu2019s a water base primer I used a water base foundation ( Estu00e9e Lauder DW) followed by LM setting powder & NYX setting spray and my foundation went on so smooth with no dry patches or textured skin, most of my pores were covered and my largest pores on my cheeks were noticeably smaller (no primer can make large pores disappear completely). Itu2019s also great at keeping oil at bay. I usually get oily 30min-1hr after applying makeup & go through 7-8 sheets of blotting paper a day, 1 sheet per hour. This primer held back my oils for at least 4hrs after application, & even then I looked more glowy then greasy, which is a huge improvement for me & I no longer feel so self conscious about my oily skin. Now I only blot once or twice a day and my foundation stays put and looks ridiculously fresh. I also wear glasses & noticed tht my foundation doesnu2019t shift or disappear anymore! I would say it performs similarly to the milk makeup primer, just with a more watery consistency like hand sanitizer lol, but it has that grip & I have to admit the end result is just a little better than the Milk primer. That being said you can go for the more affordable option cause this is pretty expensive. But if your curious & have skin like me, definitely get your hands on a sample. If you like the finish & can afford to splurge, go for it! I DO NOT regret buying this!"

Yep...another fast and perfect application.  So I tried my Lancome, my Tarte, my Clinique, my Nars, my Urban Decay, my Make Up For Ever and my Laura Mercier foundations to make sure it wasn't a high end fluke. Fast perfection with every last one. So if you are struggling with foundation application due to dry, flaky, cracky skin try a sample!!

It also can accelerate the aging process, so you will get wrinkles faster! This primer is straight a JOKE for saying itu2019s hydrating, because long term it causes damage.

For reference, my skin cannot cannot stand anything with silicone/dimethicone as it leaves a layer that suffocates my skin and makes my foundation sit on top of slippery grossness.

As an oily lady, this product doesnu2019t feel heavy or pore-clogging, which is a plus. However, it seems weirdly drying to me- like I said I have oily skin, but my foundation seems to dry up and my skin gets a bit flaky with this, which Iu2019ve never experienced before. If I skip the primer and just apply foundation on top of my sunscreen I seem to have less problems.

When I started using this one, it not only formed a slight wrinkle I have in between my eyebrows from squinting, but it made my make up last 4-5 more hours than my other primers. I do get a tad but oily using it but it doesnu2019t bother me due to have dry skin normally."

Itu2019s supposed to smell luxurious, so theyu2019ve given it a highly perfumed scent.  But itu2019s too much.  If youu2019re sensitive to scents, this will be one you should avoid.  I feel like the scent is something a kindly Grandma would wear.  Itu2019s performance doesnu2019t match the price tag in my books.  Perhaps if you do not have any textural irregularities, and your skin is already pretty flawless.  Otherwise, this is a hard pass in my books.  I bought this under the recommendation of Tati and while I love her channel, makeup and skin care is so individualized, and it seems to work amazing for her, but for me...this was returned after about two weeks.  Not worth they astronomical price tag for the performance it gives.    I will say the packaging is beautiful and who isnu2019t in love with the gold flecks immersed in this primer?  Itu2019s a total luxurious experience, but one that is more about the feeling of using a $80 primer than actually the results it gives."

I am a single mother, on one income and have three kids, it was the stupidest thing I have ever done.. AND I LOVE IT! Never has my makeup looked so flawless AND lasted all day. It smoothes over my face and although it doesn't have dymethicone to fill in your pores, I feel like my pores are less visible. Sometimes I'll do my makeup and it will look good from afar, but when I get up close I notice my makeup looks a little blotchy, you could see my dry patches, and in some areas my foundation cakes up. That doesn't happen with this foundation! If I had to choose one makeup item that is most important it would be this one. It has helped me with my confidence, because I no longer have to worry if I look like crap when I am talking to a person! I highly recommend it. Yes it is expensive, but one pump is all you need and it is lasting me forever it seems like. I will definitely be reordering. I am a believer that you get what you pay for.. And this is proof! #holygrail"

Also, I disliked the pump; it left a lot of product in the bottom of the bottle that I couldn't get out--and if it had worked, for the price, I'd have wanted to get every last drop.  For reference, I am early 30s, normal-to-dry skin.  I had such high hopes, but I used it every day for the entirety of the sample, and it just didn't perform in any way."

I took off one star because I didn't see a huge difference when wearing this primer, but I think that's mostly because it's not made for my skin type: I have combo skin and the description clearly says for normal to dry. Don't purchase this one unless that's the case for you. I found my face did get a little shiny when wearing it. Tati said on her review that she felt tingling & tightening. I didn't feel any difference whatsoever, however, that is not one of my skin concerns, so maybe it does have a tightening effect for others. I didn't feel like it did much to minimize the appearance of pores. The texture is very pleasant, not heavy or tacky at all. It doesn't have the usual silicone-like texture I'm more used to with other primers, which may be why I saw no difference with my pores. I will continue to use it and do recommend it for anyone with dull, dry, or aging skin who is more concerned with moisture & glow."

I was shocked. The side of my face with this on was actually lifted. Nothing outrageous but enough for me to notice and made my face look more vibrant and flawless. The side with the smashbox primer on itu2019s own showed more flaws and wasnu2019t as plump and glowy. I was finally convinced and purchased the full size. Only reason for knocking off one star is because I feel it is definitely overpriced for a primer and the gold flakes feel so extra. That being said it is Guerlain so itu2019s gonna be pricy."

I thought my makeup went on fine without primer but this made it melt into my skin with a beautiful glow. And I still have that same glow and perfect makeup after a long workday and walking around the city. I hate that I love it so much. Like everyone else, I never dreamt of spending $74 on a primer. That is more than my Chanel foundation! Nonetheless, I ended up purchasing the full size. I told myself that it's makeup and skincare in one. And I'm hopeful that it will last a long time since a little goes a long way. My skin is combo and this does help control my oil. It does fill my pores if I layer it a little more. And the old flecks dissolve and may be the reason for the glow."

About the primer, it really does lift and smooth out the complexion for a flawless canvas to apply makeup on. I use the Dior Dreamscape Totale also and that was always my favorite. But the gold flecks on the L'or do produce a glow from within when you apply make up over it. I use a tinted primer or a bb cream. The only foundation I ever use is the UD PRESSED POWDER foundation and I prefer it under my eyes or as a nontour. So I never fully cover my primer.

Now, I love luxury items, but for the most part I really only buy luxury makeup that I'm obsessed with. I had high hopes the first time around because of all the Youtubers I watch who were absolutely raving about it (and I wanted to feel super classy and boogie, too, I'll admit). To be totally honest, at first I was a little surprised because it wasn't as thick as I thought it'd be. It's sort of like a hand sanitizer's consistency, like a water-infused gel. You see little gold flakes in every single pump and even tho I would go crazy and use 2-3 for my whole face and neck, you TRULY only need 1, 2 at the absolute maximum, but really one will do the job, just apply it quickly because it does absorb very fast.   Even using 2x too much, if not more, literally everyday, sometimes admittedly twice in one day (I was crazy and I wanted my friends to try it too) the bottle still lasted me about three months, so I'd say if you conserve you can easily get 6 out of this bottle.  Did I feel the insane lifting and tigthtening everyone's talking about at first? Not entirely.  But I did notice that applying it in an upward motion starting at my neck and working up to my forehead made a big difference in the firmness and tightness of my skin.   But what REALLY SOLD ME on this product and is the reason I am REPURCHASING it is actually what I noticed after I ran out. Like I said, I used it obsessively every single day and I got used to it. So when I stopped using it, I realized that my foundation wasn't lasting as long and wasn't looking as flawless, no matter what other primer I used, or founation, or how I applied it, or how good my skincare was. Finally, I had to admit to myself that it was this extremely expensive item that made my makeup flawless and stay on throughout most of the day.   Sorry for such a long review, I literally never write these, but I also literally never re-purchase luxury items unless they're worth it. So the last thing I'll say is, I know it seems like an insane purchase, but think about how much money you'll save from not having to buy primer after primer when this really does work its magic.   My advice: The perfect combination that I can NOT beat right now (even after trying this primer with Dior's Capture Totale which is 83 dollars) is GUERLAIN L'OR PRIMER and DIOR AIRFLASH FOUNDATION (I am not ultra fair, but fair, and 202 CAMEO is my perfect shade and I'm telling you, nothing works better with one another than these two products. I literally wish I could like buy samples of them both and send them to everyone reading this because it really is that freaking flawless.   Okay, I'm done ranting. But if you're on the fence, just do it. I really really don't think you'll regret it. And if you have it and are underwhelmed, try a little test and use this with another primer or no primer on each side of your face with the exact same foundation/concealer/etc. I'm telling you you'll see a difference, if not immediately, by the end of the day.   Hope this helps!!!! LONG LIVE THE MAKEUP <3"

It wasn't. My skin is EXTREMELY dry and nothing made it look dewy enough to last all day and not cake my foundation and make my pores look huge by the end of the day. Until this. Every SINGLE makeup problem I had is gone. My makeup is perfect as if I had just applied it an hour ago by the end of a long day. It is outstanding. If reviews mean anything to you, take my word for it. If you have dry, sensitive skin look no further than this. Swallow the price tag and dive into this awesomeness. I'll never not have this primer; it has become a forever product."

This made my makeup last all throughout an 8 hour workday. I applied my makeup at 6:30 am and I didn't have the need to blot until 5:30 pm. My skin had a very slight luminosity but did not look oily. My skin looked smooth and radiant. Not oily but radiant with a Demi matte finish. If you have dry skin and you are looking for an extremely luminous glow. I don't think this product will do it for you. If you have Normal/Combo/Oily skin and want a slight luminous finish while still looking matte/Demi matte, this product is for you.

Even the guys at work asked if I was working out in my office because my face has looked so oily the last few days. (Which is a huge deal if guys are saying something) I noticed no lifting or minimizing of pores. I gave it to my mom who doesn't even use primer and she was no where near impressed.

The combination of the primer and foundation lasts forever! Yes the primer is tacky, but if you let it sit a few minutes before going in with foundation you'll have absolutely no problem blending in, your makeup lasts, you only have to use a drop of it so the product will last a really long time, personally I love the product and will repurchase when it eventually runs out."

So I got the chance to visit a big Sephora that carried it, my eyes glazed over, and before I knew it my debit card was out and I was bringing home the fanciest primer I've ever owned. I'm in love. My make up looks like it was just applied all.day.long! It really does make my pores look non existent and my skin a little more youthful. I'm a little annoyed that I fell in love for such a pricey product but a little goes a long way and it should last me a long time. This is a splurge. Are there other primers that work wonders at keeping make up on longer, sure! But if you're in the market for a primer that helps make up longevity and provides some skin appearance improvement this is a good one. It's not a long term skin improvement product as far as I can tell. But I love what it does provide while wearing it. It hasn't broken my sensitive skin out or caused any issues. It doesn't feel heavy after it dries down and has foundation over it. It doesn't make your make up feel cakey either."

Stay away from this primer if you have even the SLIGHTEST natural sheen as it will just enhance that. It did not hide pores or fine lines and I didn't notice it giving my makeup any additional lasting power. I returned this pretty much immediately and bought my trusty YSL.

I was skeptical about how well it would work on my skin, but as soon as it started sinking in I saw a noticeable difference in the tightness and texture of my skin- and then after putting on my foundation, I was in LOVE. It's like it made my pores disappear! The texture of the product is sightly tacky after application and my skin felt moisturized, tight and healthy. Foundation went on amazing!

The over all finish, before foundation application, is a smoothed, healthy plumped up look. I can see anyone who already has great skin being able to wear this under BB creams, or just on its own. It's very fresh, and illuminating, but not pinky toned like its counter part, Meteorites Perles, this primer is clear.  I think it gives the illusion of lifting the skin at the start, but hopefully in time it will benefit my skin w use.

What I do know is that this product has completely changed how my makeup looks. Prior to this product I had great makeup says, good makeup days and bad makeup days. Every day so far my makeup has been absolutely flawless. It seriously just looks like skin. It doesn't matter what foundation I'm using, concealer (although the new Make Up For Ever concealer is amazing as well!), powder, etc. I am just blown away by this product. I was scared about the price tag at first, but I am devoted to this product now and I can safely say this is totally worth the price. I never knew my makeup could look this amazing and I 100% owe it to this product. You can feel it working-it tightens your skin in a very hydrating, baby smooth way. My face just feels so soft and looks wonderful even with this by itself. Great job Geirlain!!!!"

The smell was pretty & I caught whiffs when I'd turn my head. It didn't irritate at all. It was a light scent. Now, the not so good.....It slightly tightened. It didn't fill a lot of my fine lines.

I tried all-day makeup, night makeup, no-makeup look, etc. And I also tried, one day, using it only in half of my face. I have oily skin and saw some comments about it not being good for oily skin, but I didn't have this problem. My makeup (with YSL Le Teint Touche u00c9clat) lasted about 7-8 hours. For the q/2 face day, it was the same as without the primer, so it doesn't improve the lasting effect of the foundation. However, the application of both foundation and concealer was slightly smoother, almost without need for buffering foundation in the end. Besides that, I noticed a subtle golden glow in my (light) skin. I thought it could be biased b/c I know about the product, so in the 1/2-face day, I asked my husband how was my makeup and he said good, but this side is different. Do you have two looks? I prefer this one.... It was the side with the primer.  Take into consideration I wear little foundation and almost never apply powder to set my makeup. I have oily skin and think powder, although helps to make the look last longer, can get cakey AND sometimes has the white-powder look in photos. So I try to avoid it."

I don't know whether the gold ingredient does a thing for my skin but the base does provide a terrific canvas for application of my liquid foundation. It's difficult to describe, but when applied and allowed to dry for a bit, it feels a bit tacky...don't be put off by this description, however. It holds my foundation (which I finish with powder) for my 12-hour work day (as long as I remember not to touch my face with my hands). I've used it with Guerlain Parure D'Lumiere foundation as well as my go to daily foundation, Giorgio Armani Lasting Silk. The two foundations are quite different in consistency (Armani being much thinner and almost watery in comparison to the Guerlain foundation), but the L'or base keeps both foundations from slipping or disappearing. I also find that it has made it easier to apply my Armani Lasting Silk foundation evenly (and I use my fingers to do this despite having tons of available brushes). I use two pumps of product to cover my entire face and lower chin line so the product quantity in this package will last quite a long time. For those of you who are all about the packaging, you won't be disappointed; it's classic Guerlain...lovely and heavy glass...lots of class. I'm more impressed by functional packaging. Having said this, the pump on this bottle works flawlessly so far; I don't know how it'll function when I'm reaching the end of the product inside. I actually bought my bottle at full price and recently purchased a second bottle because the L'or does do its job well, but II would only buy it a reasonable sale price, such as a VIB 20% discount sale. So I guess you can say that I'm happy with it but not deliriously so....I'm still hoping to find something that's a HG primer for me."

Add that to the fact that I'm a long-time acne sufferer, and the thought of putting yet more product on my skin was not a welcome one. Still, I found a primer and have been using it every day, and was never 100% thrilled; and then I tried this product. The difference is amazing! There is a marked change in the luminosity of my skin before I put on foundation (yes, even after the primer is dry) and when I apply concealer and foundation, it provides an amazingly smooth surface, even with my Smashbox Halo Powder Foundation; plus, it increases its staying power for the entire day. And it definitely creates that glow from the inside that all the beauty junkies rave about. To cut this before I ramble on too long, I love it, and although the price is pretty hefty for a primer, I'll probably grab a full-size once my sample is gone."

I like for my make to work together, and this does. In the beginning I was really on the fence about the L'or Radiance Primer. First of all, when I received it, I think it may have been opened. The package was open in the boxu2026.I didnu2019t like that. Second, I am used to primers being a little oily or greasy to aid smooth application of the foundation. This didnu2019t do that. It wasnu2019t oily or greasy and I didnu2019t feel it helped my foundation go on. Only one or two flakes of gold came outu2026.and they just sat on my face, looking like lonely glitter. I was pretty set on sending it back. Though with all three products my face did look great, and lasted all day! I am one of those girls who at night when I wash my face, I get off some eye makeup, but my foundation had disappeared hours ago. But was this the foundation or the primeru2026maybe the powder? Which of these made my makeup stay on all day? So I did an experiment, I used my makeup just as the day before, and skipped the primer. At the end of the day, my makeup was gone. This makes the product worth its weight in gold. I am keeping it. I love that I can go somewhere after work and not worry about reapplying makeup. I think it is a keeper!"

Most, if not all, of their products are pricey... It comes with the name.  With that said... On to the review:  The consistency of this product is very similar to that of a skincare serum. It's gel - like properties make it a dream to apply however, it is a tad bit runny so work fast. It absorbs relatively quickly and one pump is enough to cover the whole face. It smells of violets (which is Guerlain's signature cosmetics scent) but, quickly fades in about 5 - 10 minutes after initial application. It leaves a noticeable glow on the skin, even under heavy foundation. As for the 24 - carat gold flakes?! Well, they're made of finely milled particles that mix together with the gel when pumped. It also tightens the skin, so that large pores become less visible, without drying it out.  Side note: I'm in my early 20's so, I can't say much about fine lines and wrinkles. Sorry. =("

I have very oily and problematic skin and never liked any of the primers I came upon. They all seemed to leave my skin more greasier and pores and scars more exaggerated. I swore off primers but when I saw that this is made with pure gold the leo in me had to try it! It has a gel like consistency (a little runny) and you can't actually see the gold when you apply it on your face. It does leave your face looking glowing and dewy and seems to have a slight tightening effect. It does not contribute to the oiliness either, actually it seems that it helps keep it at bay. Well done Guerlain!"
