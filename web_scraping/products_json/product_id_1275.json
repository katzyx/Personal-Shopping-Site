So I went into a Sephora looking for a clean, moisturizing, semi-sheer, not overly tinted lip gloss, and came out of the store with this doing a happy dance NOT EVEN KIDDING. First of all the color (2 CC's) is absolutely GORGEOUS. It's a pinky, nude, peachish color. It's so beautiful and flattering. Online it looks more peachy than actually is, but it's the most gorgeous lip gloss shade ever. Second of all, it's soooooo moisturizing. It makes my lips soooo soft!!! Thirdly, it's PLUMPING. And not in a flubbery fish lip type of way, or in a burn-your-lips-off way. It has a super gentle tingle that reminds me that it's doing its job and making my lips look amazing!! I know some people are saying that it burns their lips: it definitely doesn't burn mine. All there is the slightest tingle! Fourthly (ik that's not at thing but idc), THE SMELL. It has an unusual smell but in like an AMAZING WAY. It smells like ginger in a super subtle, slightly spicy, slightly juicy fruity way. It's so addicting!!! Fifthly (yes im on a roll now lol), THE APPLICATION. The applicator gets just the right amount of product on it! And it feels thick and glossy on your lips, but not overly so, and it's not sticky. Sixthly, it makes me feel bougie and expensive and special. And we all deserve to feel that way!!! If you've even made it to the end with the amount of things I've said, I HOPE THAT YOU BUY THIS. BECAUSE I PLAN ON USING THIS FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE: EVERYDAY, EVERY MOMENT. IM OBSESSED."

Well, I had to just settle with th pinkish color. NO ONE AT SEPHORA KNOWS ANYTHING OF WHY THIS IS A THING. So if you get it and it looks pinkish when the tester bin shows white, that is why. I think it gets whiter over time? Not sureu2026. They say oxidation but I swear this one that I saw was recently opened and Iu2019m the store when previous week it didnu2019t have a sample. Anyway.

Unlike most lip glosses, the formal isn't tight or sticky - the gloss glides on the lips and you are then instantly met with the cool plumping effects. I also love how the plumping effect isn't too overbearing, and is comfortable enough to wear. I think this shade is also perfect for everyone! It being clear makes it extremely versatile, as I can wear it alone for a more natural look or use it to top off one of my favorite lipsticks.

Aside from the beautiful packaging, the formula is not sticky and feels very comfortable and hydrating on the lips. It applies smoothly and with ease and the outcome is a glossy, full lip. It does have a sweet smell but it is not overwhelming and actually quite lovely. This gloss has earned a permanent spot in my purse and I donu2019t leave home without it. I plan on picking up some of the other shades!"

You can see that it changed the color of my lips to give it a darker color and the border of my lips were more defined and darker. It didnu2019t plump my lips too much but I do see a difference. Initially, it had a strong tingling sensation but that slowly fades and doesnu2019t feel uncomfortable. It smells like cinnamon which is really unique. I donu2019t think Iu2019ve ever tried a lip gloss with that in it. Also, the color is really pretty. I tried 2 CCu2019s and I can see this working for every skin tone. Overall, Iu2019m super happy with the results and will be using this on the daily!"

It has an interesting smell and the best way to describe it is holiday time at Michaels. It has a mix between the cinnamon and the peppermint so they feel very light on the lips, not too cooling or warming (thinking of gloss bomb heat, much less). It is not my favorite smell but as someone who is scent sensitive it has not deterred me, they are super shiny. I picked up 3 shades during the last sale, and i would say they are on the sheer side (which i prefer) but pouty and superficial are very similar on the lips in case you are only trying to choose one. The doefoot on these is also larger than his original glosses which i like because it's easier to not have to dip in several times. These glosses are also pretty large in terms of the amount of product you are getting, double the size of an average gloss."
