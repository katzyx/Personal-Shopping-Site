It is creamy and smooth, unlike most matte lipsticks I've tried, and I really like this. However, the color is not red -- at least not on me. It has too much orange undertones, and I like my reds to be deep with blue undertones. I was hoping there would be other colors to choose from, but the selection is limited. I wanted to like this so much but because of the color, I give this 3 stars. I'll watch this line to see if they introduce more colors in the future."

The packaging has another great thing going for it too, I can literally toss this into my purse and be able to find it anywhere, it doesn't need to be in a purse pocket, or makeup bag, it is a cute handful."

I wore this as a lip balm for a run and it lasted through all the humid and sweat. My lip balm/product's color usually disappears after my workout. Very impressed because of that.

Okay, this is a new brand and as I understand itu2019s family-owned (which is a good thing though, Iu2019d rather support new brands than give my money to the monstrous conglomerates like Estee Lauder and such).   The lipstick costs $36 which seems appropriate for a luxury brand (I donu2019t get it why so many people complain about the price, like have you been in Sephora recently?).   Pros:   - gliding properties are good, the application is smooth and the color payoff is instant. - the design of the case definitely looks fresh and interesting, Iu2019m so tired of all these never-ending yellow-rose gold obsessed brands, theyu2019re so omnipresent that you, at times, canu2019t tell which is which (like can you really tell if itu2019s Tom Ford, Patrick Ta or Hourglass instantly? I doubt that). The color of the case is pretty and very Gen Z.   Cons:   - case: although I appreciate the effort to invent something new design-wise in the beauty world full of drab lipsticks with repetitive patterns, I cannot really say that the case is perfect for me. Yes, itu2019s nice, it feels luxurious, itu2019s very unique, but also itu2019s very heavy and bulky. Material-wise it was not a good idea to use magnets (even Tom Ford doesnu2019t use them anymore) because it is not environmentally-friendly and magnets are not recyclable at all.  - the design and the color of the case call for a clean formula, but this lipstick is surprisingly u201cnon-cleanu201d. Itu2019s like a very old-fashioned full of silicones and other bad ingredients lipstick in a 2022 case.   - the lipstick is very drying.  - Itu2019s only 3 g (given the very big case!!!)"

What primarily keeps this from being a five-star review is that the product does settle into lip lines - and the packaging, while cute, is cumbersome.  Still, I would consider purchasing again."

I couldnu2019t get a smooth edge and it just made a simple process more complicated than it needed to be because every imperfection was so obvious. If it was sheer coverage it wouldnu2019t be as big of a deal. Itu2019s also a slightly patchy but nothing a couple layers canu2019t fix. Oh & itu2019s very long wearing.

Itu2019s like a lightly shaded lip balm is pretty much what this is, so donu2019t let the u201cbrightnessu201d of the shade scare you. I love this product and I will be recommending to everyone!"

            "review_text": "Folks, do not be fooled by the name of this product. This is no matte lip balm. Itu2019s matte, but definitely not a lip balm. It is definitely more akin to a lipstick (before anyone thinks, u201cwell the name on Sephora says lipstick balm,u201d it is described as a matte lip balm on the box itself). I was really intrigued by this because itu2019s supposed to be a matte lip balm, which sounds like an oxymoron. Sadly, Iu2019m a bit let down as this definitely applies and feels more like the traditional lip stick. The packaging is interesting because it resembles a large pill to me. Itu2019s also very weighty and the cap is held to the base of the lipstick by a magnet. There is no fragrance, which is a plus. The actual lip u201cbalmu201d itself, if used very gently and in only a couple thin layers, can look like a slight tint. In the picture attached (taken with flash), I used a normal amount of pressure to swatch it, and it is already pretty pigmented. The actual product on my lips feels slightly drying, definitely not moisturizing like a lip balm should be. It dries down matte and does not heavily emphasize chapped lips, provided that I didnu2019t go ham with the application. It has fairly little transfer when I pressed a tissue paper on top of my lips. Overall, itu2019s awful as a matte u201clip balm,u201d but decent if you use it as a matte lipstick."

The application is so smooth and easy due to a unique dome shaped tip that allows you to precisely apply the color in one sweep. The color of this product is a rich,deeply pigmented shade that can be used as a sheer or can be built up to a stunning full coverage shade with a staying power of up to 12 hours.  I absolutely love this lip color product and will definitely be purchasing other colors,as they have gorgeous shades to choose from."

The lipstick itself is domed so it makes application super effortless and easy. Second of all, the formula is beautiful for a matte lipstick. It glides onto the lips and feels emollient like a lip balm, but it's simultaneously blurring and matte. It's like a blotted lip in a stick form. Over time, it becomes more matte on the lips, but I don't find it uncomfortable or overly drying. You can sheer it out super easily, but also build it up to full coverage. The formula actually reminds me a lot of recently released K-beauty matte lipsticks/tints. Definitely picking up more colors now."

The product is specified as long wear, but it is not transfer proof.  However, I would say that it is transfer-lite.  I found the formula to be comfortable to wear and I didn't have any issues with feathering or smearing. I should mention that this wears much more like a lipstick than a balm, but I like the texture and comfortable feel, and it has that trendy, soft lipstick-blurred look going on.  I will definitely be wearing this frequently. I think it's a great shade to transition into my Fall ones. I really like it, and I think it is absolutely cart worthy!"

Even with the built up look, I found the lipstick to be very light! You really don't notice it or feel that it's there, but you can see the pigment! It's a true lightweight matte that doesn't dry out your lips. I'm going to be keeping this in my purse for everywhere I go! The magnetic cap is also a game-changer because I hate that my lipstick caps somehow get cracked by being in my bag."

This is an effortless, comfortable, and yet stunning lipstick!  The lipstick feels incredible, doesnu2019t emphasize lip lines, and yet does have a soft matte appearance. The packaging is also brilliant: it has a magnetic enclosure with firm magnets. No issues with carrying this in my bag. I was iffy on application, as I tend to prefer a pointed tip to my lip products, but somehow it does indeed work? I was pleasantly surprised.  The attached photo is natural light, no filters, and showing the shade u201cWindburnu201d. Not only is the color divine, but the finish truly meets the expectations described by the brand. Very pleased!"
