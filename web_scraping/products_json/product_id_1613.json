    "ingredients": "Ingredients: Alcohol Denat., Fragrance (Parfum), WaterAquaEau, Tocopherol, Limonene, Alpha-Isomethyl Ionone, Benzyl Salicylate, Hydroxycitronellal, Linalool, Coumarin, Benzyl Benzoate, Benzyl Cinnamate, Citral, Evernia Prunastri (Oakmoss) Extract, Farnesol, Benzyl Alcohol, Geraniol, Citronellol, Isoeugenol, Eugenol, Pentaerythrityl Tetra-Di-T-Butyl Hydroxyhydrocinnamate, Bht, Benzoic Acid &lt;ILN44751&gt; Please be aware that ingredient lists may change or vary from time to time. Please refer to the ingredient list on the product package you receive for the most up to date list of ingredients.",
    "how_to_use": "Suggested Usage:.-Fragrance is intensified by the warmth of your own body. Apply in the creases of your knees and elbows for a longer-lasting, stronger scent.&nbsp;.-After applying, avoid rubbing or dabbing skin. This breaks down the fragrance, causing it to wear off more quickly.&nbsp;.-If you prefer placing fragrance on your wrists, be sure to reapply after frequent handwashing, as this tends to rinse off the scent.&nbsp;.-Replace fragrance after 12 months. Expired perfumes more than a year old lose the integrity of the original scent... Eau de Toilette or Eau de Parfum?: .The difference lies in the volume of perfume oil. While EDT contains five to nine percent, EDP contains more, usually eight to 14 percent. EDPs, therefore, last longer and smell more intense.",

It had the strangest, lactic, porta potty type smell to me.  I couldn\u2019t understand how it was even in existence.  Who would wear this?!  So every time I go into a Sephora, I try and give it another chance and let it sit on a tester strip for a bit and keep taking whiffs.  Nope.  Awful.  BUT THEN\u2026 I read some reviews about how you need to let it sit for a bit.  How it transforms.  I became curious, and decided to order.  I\u2019m so glad I did!  Yes, at first the scent is overwhelming and slightly off putting.  But then something magical happens. It\u2019s like the most sophisticated cupcake with sandalwood frosting.  If you like Dior Hypnotic Poison, imagine that mixed with some root beer and a very sweet breath mint.  It has a spiciness to it. It\u2019s not your typical teenage gourmand type of sweetness.  It\u2019s mature.  Unique for sure, and I have soooo many gourmand scents.  I love it now!!"

Things this does not smell like:  1- vanilla 2- sex  Things this does smell like 1- porta potty that has been overused 2- a urinal cake soaked in urine 3- a combination of the two  I don't know if I have a faulty bottle, or if the people who love this don't have the sense of scent and just don't realize it.

After about 5 minutes, it turns into the creamiest, warmest vanilla scent ever. It smells like creamy vanilla pods, in my opinion, not vanilla extract. If you were a fan of the since discontinued Vanilla Lace from VS, you will love this. While some people find it basic, I find it to be elegant, classy and upscale. Is it overpriced considering it is so polarizing? Yes. But it is a very intoxicating scent. It's so hard to find a true vanilla fragrance that can be worn all year, day or night, in office or out. This one most certainly can. I smell no masculine tones in this whatsoever, just a very gourmand vanilla scent. No musk or sandalwood. Makes me think if you put all the vanillas in the world together, this would be the end result. Very different from TF, and I really do love it."

My bottle has a much 'stronger' smell, an opening note of almond that quickly turns into a spicy, woodsy, much more masculine leaning scent with no playdoh-like note at all and the vanilla I can only smell after several hours of wearing it. I'm confused lol. It is still a great fragrance overall and I will continue to wear it and see what happens."

The appreciation for me came when I sprayed it on my bathroom towel...instant luxury mood initiated!!. It's been 4 days and I still love going to the bathroom...ever took a boujie bathroom break?!?! I love it for bringing a mood to my living space. I'm gonna try the living room next!.. This was a gift to me, and I'm gonna be honest as say I'm glad I didn't spend my personal funds for this.

After about 10min it dried to the best buttercream vanilla angel food cake smell I've ever smelled.  The smell reminds me of the original vanilla ice cream from Thriftys they sold in the 80s and 90s before changing the recipe. Smells similar to Anik Goutals Vanilla Essence. Smells very creamy and natural also similar to bath and body works vanilla essential oil perfume I wore in highschool in 1998. Lasted tell I washed my sweatshirt a week later and prob could have lasted longer. Tom ford fragrances last a longtime. Waiting to purchase during next VIB event. Great year round fragrance."

I\u2019ve been wearing this every day since I received it and I don\u2019t know if I can wear anything other than vanilla perfume now!   The packaging it arrived in was luxurious and really held up to the Tom Ford name. The box itself feels like a soft leather and then the bottle is a smooth glass. I\u2019m very impressed with the packaging! You can tell they put as much thought into the presentation as the scent.   The scent itself is a sweet, warm vanilla that really wraps around you without being too overwhelming. You only need to spray a tiny amount of it onto your wrist, tap your wrists together and then tap them behind your ears. If you do anymore than that, it will get overwhelming because it is a strong scent so a little goes a long way! If you do use a little more, the scent will cling to you into the next day and your clothes which is fine with me because it smells amazing!   It is a very warm, inviting scent and I\u2019ve gotten a lot more attention and compliments while wearing this. I think the long lasting wear, the packaging, and sultry scent make the perfume absolutely worth the price. It is obvious the company put a lot of thought and care into creating this perfume. I highly recommend!"

To start off I really want to thank Sephora and INFLUENSTER for including me in this study. My first thought was nah not true but when the box came I was stoked to open it although my gf claimed it. I can't wait until she is gone and or not paying attention and I put some on. I've done it before and have gotten lucky so I don't see why it wouldn't work now. Do we need to say more? Ladies know exactly what I'm talking about. The only downfall is that it's very subtle and doesn't really last a while day strong. So I would say for the price it could be a bit stronger. I love the vanilla tincture and the vanilla absolute but maybe that's what they we re aiming for all along was a very mild scent and not overpowering blast. So for the cost send the time it lasts I have to go with 4 stars but I do recommend to others."

It is a very strong vanilla scent, and when it wears down a bit you can subtly smell the more sensual sandalwood. It projects and lasts all day, so no more than 1-2 sprays are needed. I personally prefer my sweeter scents to be a bit spicier so I layer it with amber scents myself. Overall really enjoy this, another great tom ford perfume."

I do recommend this scent for both sexes and especially for couples to go ahead and purchase and try it out. You will not be disappointed at all in my honest opinion."

The dry down is a luxurious, straightforward woody vanilla that is pleasing to all. I've gotten so many compliments on this cozy fragrance. The bottle is stunning and looks incredible on my vanity.

Overall, the smell is somewhat comparable to other vanilla eau de parfums, but there is a subtle, sweet, yet calm vanilla scent to it, that I just can't put my finger on it. It lasts for the whole day, and doesn't leave any bitter smells upon application, or as the day wears on."

Theres an over-note of vanilla but it\u2019s not sickly sweet there\u2019s a musky spice to it and I LOVE it! Doesn\u2019t cause a headache either which is a plus. I just wish the scent lasts a bit longer but I don\u2019t mind reapplying. Another positive is the Tom Ford quality, the packaging is very luxe which is a bonus!"

Tom Ford Vanilla Sex EDP will be will be packaged firmly in the nice box shown in the photo I posted with this review. Pull the top off and you will reveal the beautiful clear bottle with cream colored Vanilla Sex. Now..what you are waiting for. How is that first spray? Definitely get hit with the Vanilla..but not in a bad way. The second thing that came to my mind was that it was a more feminine smell. Doesn't necessarily mean that I will not be giving it another try! With Tom Ford you may not like it the first time you try it. Give it another try and it can change your mind sometimes. The Vanilla Sex is a powdery vanilla smell with a hint of sandalwood. If you are looking for something different this is definitely the one for you! My wife sprayed this on before she left for work. I walked in the bathroom about an hour later and it was like she had just sprayed it! This is one where you grab your shirt the next day and you still smell it. It's a really pleasant smell..as long as you like vanilla lol. Now, let's talk about this $395 price for a 50ml bottle. Is it worth it?? I can't tell you yes or no on that question. I can tell you that a couple small sprays is all you need. I do highly suggest that you go and sample this before you go and fork out $400 on a bottle of this! Vanilla Sex isn't going to be for everyone. Would I recommend this?? Yes. Please sample first before buying though."

I tend to lean towards both floral and bright scents as well as earthy and musk and this scent fit right in. It\u2019s sensual, warm and sophisticated, perfect for the fall/winter season. The first prominent note is a warm almost bourbon vanilla and then the bitter almond and musky sandalwood comes through. The scent is smoky and glamorous. This is not your average vanilla sweet scent, it is deep, spicy, elegant and much more complex and elevated. The sandalwood essence along with the vanilla absolute really emphasizes that nutty sultriness. It\u2019s well rounded and there\u2019s a mysterious floral bitterness along with a sweet almost marzipan like scent that comes in right at the end. I loved the way it dried down and meshed with my body chemistry, the musk really came through after it settled into my skin. This perfume isn\u2019t for everyone, just like its name, it is provocative, bold, and compelling. But even if you\u2019re hesitant I would still give this a try. I personally love it, its scent unfurls the longer you wear it and is an experience in itself.  It\u2019s neither feminine nor masculine but a perfect blend of the two embracing the lightness of the vanilla and spice of the sandalwood. The scent throw is decent and head turning and the lasting power is strong in the first few hours and then lingers to a light skin scent after 4-5 hours. Just like the scent, the bottle itself is elegant and modern. It looks so beautiful on my countertop and is a stand out amongst my perfume collection. Tom Ford Vanilla Sex is a deep, sultry, smoky and warm scent that will have you smelling as glorious and as sophisticated as you already are."

I enjoyed the order notes of spices and almond as well. One of my least favorite things about the fragrance is the name. To me it doesn't fit the fragrance best. I wouldn't say it's an overly sexy smell and the term vanilla reminds me of something being boring. It's marketed as being a unisex fragrance but I think it is more feminine."

There\u2019s something about it that feels both comforting for day wear and captivating for nights out. The longevity is another plus. A small dab in the morning, and its enchanting aroma stays with me all day. It's not just me who loves it; I'm constantly getting asked about my perfume. Vanilla Sex by Tom Ford isn\u2019t just a perfume, it's a statement. It has become an indispensable part of my daily routine and undoubtedly, my favorite fragrance of all time. For anyone contemplating this purchase, I say it's a decision you won't regret."

However, in time tones down and you begin to smell the warm, soft masculine sandalwood notes that pair nicely with the rich vanilla notes. In time, I learned that a little goes a long way, and with that, only using a spray or two is just right. It has outstanding staying power.

The scent to me is very dimensional, it opens with a very strong projection of almond blossom (too me) which lasts for a good hour or so before fading to the middle note. The middle note to me give off a boozy vanilla nutmeg vibe (adore desert esc fragrance) before fading into the base of just creamy sandalwood-esc vanilla. The base notes remind me of vanilla fields but this is so much better. This can definitely  be worn on its own however it\u2019s even more divine if paired with fruity type fragrances which makes a custom fragrance unique to you. It\u2019s definitely a cooler weather scent as being in Florida I think with the humid summers it might be a little too sweet."

It\u2019s not your typical vanilla scent, but rather a warm gourmand fragrance that has a seductive earthiness to it. The fragrance is backed by the bitterness of almonds, the softness of mysterious flower petals, as well as the smoothness of sandalwood. It\u2019s a modern vanilla perfume that has a complex and elegant aroma. As someone who loves the soothing beige-toned aesthetic, I was drawn to this perfume. It\u2019s perfect for intimate date nights and elegant occasions when you don\u2019t want your perfume to say \u201chi\u201d before you do. However, since this is a skin-scent, it may not be quite as bold or long-lasting as one may expect (especially for the higher price point). All in all, Vanilla Sex is a total win that\u2019s dreamy, complex, and elegant. It\u2019s a well-timed launch for those who crave a bit of the \u201cquiet luxury\u201d aesthetic within their fragrance wardrobe. I hope you find this review helpful! \ud83d\ude0a"

It lasted throughout my 8 plus hour work shift and seemed to agree with the chemistry of my body.  I was also able to layer this fragrance with another gourmand fragrance for a more sultry combination. Overall, its amazing, its a great addition to my current collection and I would purchase this product in the future."

However, I was pleasantly surprised when I first sprayed it, and after having used it for the last few weeks , the scent continues to grow on me. On initial spray you get an immediate burst of almond, similar to the smell of marzipan mixed with vanilla. As it dries down you get the more sensual vanilla and sandalwood. I didn\u2019t pick up on any floral that it claims to contain in its middle notes. Overall It has a decent projection and lasts about 8 hours and longer on clothes. I\u2019ve had a lot of friends and coworkers tell me I smell cozy, which really plays well given the colder season we\u2019re in. Overall if you\u2019re looking for a more elevated take on vanilla perfume, then definitely give this one a go."

That being said, this one is not bad. I tried it in both warmer and colder weather. In warm weather, it was overly sweet in a gourmand sense. I would have described it as a very authentic vanilla, reminding me of vanilla extract. That was all I smelled in the heat. Now I tried it again in colder weather, and it was so much better. It starts out with a very robust, thick vanilla smell. It also has a plasticky (in a good way)/almond vibe to it. It then thins out to a little woodiness in the background. This is about an hour in and this is my favorite part. It then settles into a tonka/sandalwood/vanilla trio. Overall, I\u2019d say that this fragrance does really good for what it is: a vanilla centric fragrance. If you like vanilla, then I think you will like this. If you are like me and don\u2019t care for it as much, then you may appreciate that it is a well executed fragrance but just not for you. The projection is good for the first 2 hours, then stays close only for those you are speaking to or standing next to. It stayed on my skin overnight and I could still pick it up when I woke in the morning."

For the rest of this fragrance\u2019s lifespan, the scent does not shift further and root beer continues to be what emerges.  The floral notes never make an appearance.  The initial spray leans feminine due to the sweetness of the vanilla and cherry pairing, but as the sweetness mellows and it morphs into a steady root beer scent, it becomes more unisex.  The name Vanilla Sex is very fitting because, like the colloquial phrase, this fragrance is simple and reliable.  Despite having many notes, the end result is not snobbish or complex.  Beyond the first spritz, the scent is consistent so you know what to expect no matter when it is applied.  But don\u2019t be fooled; it\u2019s a powerhouse and its strong projection lasts over 12 hours on the skin.  This will be an all year round, everyday fragrance for me."

If you like vanilla smell, this is a next level, in my opinion. Smell is long lasting and it doesn\u2019t change in my skin (fragrance tends to change smell in my skin, not the case here). The bottle is the classic Tom Ford style, light brown with whine undertone just makes the color of the bottle is beautiful and classy. So chic!

The first time I put it on, I was shocked and sad.  The initial scent was not pleasant to my nose.  It smelled heavily chemically and unpleasant. Oh no!  Over the course of an hour or so, I kept going back and sniffing myhe pulse point on my wrist and as the scent mellowed and developed, I was left with a lovely light almond-y fragrance that I soon realized that I actually really liked.    IMO, the scent doesn\u2019t carry beyond my personal space and I am okay with that. What it does do is stay close to me and last a really long time. Yes, it gets fainter with time, but 10 hours later I could still smell it on my skin.  I wouldn\u2019t suggest that anyone blind buy this one. It\u2019s definitely a scent that you should try first and for sure don\u2019t judge it upon your first sniff. It\u2019s a lovely scent once it dries down and develops."

I couldn\u2019t believe I was lucky enough to be chosen.  I\u2019m still super happy and grateful.  However, I need to be honest and reveal that I hate vanilla smells.  I despise it.  Every now and then I\u2019ll indulge in a popular item to see what the hype is.  So I\u2019ll start with my pros.  This is different.  Very much vanilla extract and almonds.  It\u2019s not a sweet sugary type of vanilla smell.  Personally I find that refreshing.  Two sprays and you\u2019re set for half the day.  No jokes, no smokes.  It lasts FOREVER!  I love getting compliments from others saying they can smell me regardless of how I feel about vanilla smells in general.  You can tell this is LUXURY baby.  It sprays so evenly, probably because the nozzle gives you a very fine soft misting.  It hits different from the other bottles I own.    My only con is that I hate vanilla.  After using it for a few weeks I find that layering it with your other favorite vanilla scents can really help to add a more sweet or musky layer of smell.  I only took off 1 star bc I personally don\u2019t like the smell, but it\u2019s still impressive.  I can totally understand why people gravitate towards these Tom Fords fragrances bc they are without a doubt luxury!  I\u2019m so happy to have something like this in my collection.    I received this product as a free sample in exchange for my thoughts."

Simple, I generally am very picky on both sweet forward frags and also vanilla scents. Also no beating around the bush, this is a very expensivo perfume. So I think you should try this before you blind buy. But I think any of the niche line Tom ford should probably be tried before a blind buy.  Now with that said, I think this smells very good. I really think this is getting way too much hate. This is a vanilla bomb. The vanilla is the start of the show, with different notes of vanilla coming from the mid and base notes. The top notes is a nice touch of bitter almonds with which pairs well with the sweet and almost boozy flavors of the vanilla. Almost like really good bourbon vanilla extract.  I think it\u2019s a true unisex scent. Funny enough I have had one person say it\u2019s too manly and another say it is too feminine. Both were two separate females who said those remarks. I think this is a good performing scent, very good longevity and decent sillage. Really like the color of the juice, and makes it look even more beautiful and appealing looking at the bottle and presentation.  I have to give this one at least a 4 as this is probably the best vanilla flavor I have smelled. It is not super my cup of tea nor is the price something you are getting for a good bang for your buck. But just like most of Tom Ford niche line, you are getting somewhat natural excellent quality scents which are definitely unique and should be respected. If you love the notes of this scent I think you would like it very much.   In case you have not read the reviews, a lot of hate on this one. I definitely think it is unwarranted, but again more of a reason to try in store or buy a sample/ decant before buying a new bottle. Haters going to hate, but I give this a thumbs up on smelling dang good."

The notes are vanilla, sandwood, and bitter almond and the almond very much stands out, and is very much bitter. Its lasting power is until about midday I'd say. I think this is someones signature scent, but the bitter of the almond is a little too much for me. On the big postive is one spray is more than good enough to apply and noticeably smell it. All in all I think this would have been a 4 star for me if there was more vanilla, like a delicious almond sugar cookie."

When I\u2019ve used it the scent has lasted all day and when I would move I\u2019m able to get a wife of it. It really is a lovely fragrance and one I would continue to wear.

It smelled pretty linear in that respect from start to finish, but I loved it, so I don't mind that about it. The projection is enough for it to be noticeable yet inoffensive. This quality makes it an excellent choice for a variety of settings, from professional environments to intimate gatherings. The most impressive aspect of this fragrance is its longevity.

The presentation is in the classic Tom Ford bottle and is always classy and presentable.  The scent goes on with a big blast of vanilla bean which isn't overpowering or cloying.  It might be the almonds which tones down the sweetness a bit and makes me think of almost a slightly dirty vanilla.   As the wearing goes on the dirtiness dies down and the vanilla goes into more of a stereotypical sweet vanilla.  It's pleasant but definitely not groundbreaking.  I feel you initially have a good sillage bubble around you but that dies off quickly.  It's a unisex fragrance although I feel it leans feminine but can easily be pulled off by a confident man.  Longevity is my biggest concern here as I get about 4-5 hours before this becomes a skin scent.  At $250 for a 1 ounce bottle MSRP, I'm going to need a lot more performance than that.  A rare lukewarm offering from Tom Ford in my humble opinion."

It\u2019s not very sweet, you will not smell like cookies. It is a creamy, soft, powdery, light floral. It changes a lot in the first hour, but lingers softly afterwards. This is a nice fall/winter fragrance. Also spring appropriate because of the powder and floral. Reminds me of soaking in the tub with a butterball bath bomb while burning Palo Santo. This is softer, yet more complex than kayali vanilla (which I love as well) but has that grown up vanilla scent. Smells more expensive and complex than warm vanilla sugar, but would also put this in the same type class. For the price point I probably will not re-purchase.  If you love soft, powdery, vanilla woodsy scents, this would be one that I would recommend."

One of the things I like the most about vanilla sex is the longevity of the scent. When you put it on before leaving the house you won't have to reapply till the next time you're wearing it. The names Tom Ford comes up with for their scents are somewhat jovial and could be considered cheesy, but when you get past that, what's in the bottle always makes up for it."

Happy to say that whatever high quality oil is used in Vanilla Sex does NOT trigger me!  And I love the fragrance! Initially I smell mainly sweet vanilla and almond (my man says I smell like cookies), which is nice - but the dry down is my favorite. Subtle whispers of sandalwood, tonka, and amber give this a VERY sexy quality, and it lasts for hours on me. I can also still get a whiff of vanilla, which is nice because then I smell like sexy and sophisticated cookies.  Took off one star just because I think the addition of a fruity (maybe citrus or berry) note is what would make this a holy grail for me! For now, it shall just be my date night go to."

I have absolutely no idea why it would smell like that to me all of a sudden but it does. I am still planning to wear it and hopefully it won\u2019t smell this way to me anymore. I really have gotten many compliments on it and it does smell really smooth. There\u2019s just that weird note of butt paste when it dries down."

Vanilla Sex has a subtle sandalwood opening and then a burst of fresh vanilla to warm and entice those around you. As the day goes on the fragrance turns to more of an almond scent with a hint of vanilla, while on my skin. Each day after I spray on the fragrance it immediately boosts my mood and makes me feel so pleasant.

It's vanilla. It is that 90s era throwback vanilla that transports me to a bath and body shop when i worked retail in.college vanilla. I wouldn't wear it on its own, but when i layered it with other TF scents, it worked. Not for me, but for you if you are a vanilla scented candle type person.

Since you only need a small amount to get the effect, the bottle will surely last a long while, making the price point a bit more reasonable.

As far as the scent any Tom Ford scents I've tried are intended to be unisex but tend to lean a little more one way or the other. This one I felt smelled more feminine which made me like it more. I found it to be a scent that I'd wear more formally then casually because it is stronger and I personally like a more calm airy scent for day to day. So this bottle will certainly last me a very longtime! The initial smell is an overwhelming Vanilla but that intensity calms skin after & leaves a very pleasant smell of vanilla that is not overwhelming. Anyone on the fence I'd say definitely buy it don't let the cost hold you back you will get every bit you pay back out of it!"

I just think for the price I cant say that it is worth it. You can get a really great milky vanilla called Bianco Latte for a much better price per ounce.

The depth of the scent is next level. I definitely pick up on the vanilla, sandalwood, and almond notes. The vanilla hits first and strongest. I think the scent is very long lasting and I feel like I only needed 2 spritz to be content with the intensity. I realize that this is marketed as a genderless/unisex scent, but I believe that this would come off a too vanilla/almond-like for most men. It\u2019s not the sweetest perfume I\u2019ve ever used, but it definitely leans more feminine.   Side note: this perfume layers amazing with the Billie Eilish perfume."

The vanilla isn\u2019t sweet but smells exactly like a pure vanilla extract. That smell can either be awesome or terrible to people or on other people\u2019s skin so I HIGHLY RECOMMEND YOU SAMPLE THIS FIRST! It doesn\u2019t evolve or change much from that initial spray so what you get is what you get. The performance is alright. It gives off a very strong projection in the beginning hour but dies down quickly to a nice skin scent for the remaining 4-6 hours. The problem isn\u2019t that this scent smells bad to me (I love it) but it\u2019s the cost of the fragrance. At this price, you can buy other vanilla-forward fragrances (or even a strong body wash/lotion) that can give you the same feel as this. $400 for a 50ml is expensive and while I love TF fragrances, this is a hard sell at that price. Would I recommend this? Yes as it is good to me but I strongly suggest sampling this at the local Sephora as it might not be good for you. $400 is way too high to do a blind buy."

Long lasting on my skin and clothing. It isn't heady or over-powering, but it is a signature scent that others will notice but won't be offended by. I gave it a four only because there is something in the top that tickles my nose initially that I usually sneeze once. I don't know what it is, but I can definitely overlook that and recommend this to anyone who has a budget for a sophisticated, sexy vanilla fragrance.

The other one does not last on the skin and the smell changes after a while and you have to reapply. This perfume gives off scent all day. Those saying you can get other less expensive scents that are similar are probably correct, but you are not getting the quality of the TF one. The quality of this investment is better than my other less expensive vanilla scents. I\u2019m not sure the issue with those saying it does not last but it lasted on my skin throughout my work day. I received compliments on it first time I wore it out. Someone actually leaned in and smelled me lol. I\u2019d worn a cardigan days earlier with the TF scent and it was still on there when I put in on later in the week. I didn\u2019t even reapply. It just smelled light and nice. Love it!"

The sandalwood really grounds it so it never becomes sickeningly sweet. I think this perfume is unisex with a lean towards feminine; however, a man could feel comfortable wearing this if he isn\u2019t looking for a heavily masculine scent. I personally have a hard time smelling this on myself after a few hours, but I tend to go nose blind to my perfumes. Other people have commented on it after several hours of wear, and I have noticed being able to smell it on fabrics a few days later so its longevity seems good. I have a large perfume collection and I would absolutely buy this perfume (while crying a little about the cost)."

Only a few hours later do I get a nearly pure vanilla scent but the fragrance is close to completely worn off by then. Smells like a drugstore to mid-range fragrance and definitely not worth the price.  But because it\u2019s new and TF I predict every 20-30 something girl in every Vegas nightclub will be taking a break from Santal 33 (thank god) and drenching themselves in this for the next few months.

It also smelled so powdery I was getting a headache. I\u2019ve been spraying it on my skin and when I put my shirt on, it softens the notes that are too harsh for me. When it dries down and the day goes on, I love how warm and vanilla it smells on me and my clothes! It\u2019s subtle which I can appreciate but a little too subtle you\u2019d have to be sniffing me while hugging me to smell it. Even on myself, I\u2019d need to be moving around to smell it. Maybe I need to spray more? But it\u2019d make me dizzy when I first spray it if I do any more! I will continue to wear this for certain days only because of the vanilla smell later on, but I would not recommend this unless you love powdery florals! If you like vanilla, you won\u2019t get the vanilla until you have to sit through the harsh initial fragrance. On another note, absolutely love the beautiful packaging, as usual, from Tom Ford."

This smells so fake and I don\u2019t pick up the almond hint at all, which was why I bought it. My local store never has TF out on display, so I knew I would have to order online.

The top note of almond is very heavy to start almost too much so, however once the fragrance dries down, the almond mellows out and swirls into a beautiful blend of rich, comforting vanillas, earthy sandalwood and sweet, soft amber.  This scent is long lasting, mysterious and sexy and makes you feel luxurious.    The bottle is glamorous and modern in appearance.  An absolutely stunning addition to any vanity. The inside a milky opaque shade with the bottle being an elegant gold. It conveys opulence without being tacky or gaudy.  Another stunning fragrance from Tom Ford."

I found the look of it also very elegant and pretty. It\u2019s clear with a light beige look to it. It over all looks elegant from the packaging to the overall perfume look and smell it has. I went out with my boyfriend and my friends and they all found it sweet and fresh vanilla scent nice. It\u2019s definitely luxurious and elegant which is what I like about it too. Tom Ford never fails to amaze me with their products.  I definitely recommend anyone to really try it, never know if it\u2019s the right scent for you."

I can honestly say that I've never sprayed a fragrance and needed to cover it up with something else-- this was that one. It's almost similar to a bad cough syrup, spicy, not creamy for a vanilla scent AT ALL.  To give this fragrance the credit it deserves, however, the dry down is quite pleasant. I scrubbed my wrists with hand sanitizer in my car immediately after to get the awful smell off of me, but even through that, the scent lasted. I find myself 5 hours later catching wiffs and actually liking it more and more. Is it worth over $300? Absofreakinglutely not! Any fragrance that takes 5 hours to smell good is not worth a penny! So disappointing, as I love vanilla and was so thrilled about this one!"

I personally will be wearing it about one time a week due to the sweet aroma and I will be letting my friends know about this to purchase also."

It's warm, decadent, and oh-so-seductive, clinging to your skin like a whispered promise. Performance is stellar, but be warned: this fragrance leans heavily feminine. Think dessert drizzled with honey, not a rugged campfire. If you're comfortable embracing the sweet side, Vanilla Sex is an unforgettable experience. Just prepare for compliments (and maybe a few raised eyebrows). 4 out of 5 stars, minus one for the femme fatale vibes."

If you've ever smelled vanilla tincture or extract straight from the bottle, then you know it doesn't smell as good as it does when it's mixed. If you love vanilla, don't let the name and notes of this fragrance fool you into thinking this is a safe blind buy because it is NOT. I suggest trying it in store first."
