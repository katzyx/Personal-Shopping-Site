I regularly use anti-aging products like retinol at night, vitamin C serum in am, etc.  I have milia around my eyes from rich eye cream that I couldn't get rid of with various toners. Using this cleanser for a small amount of time in the morning has gotten rid of those tiny milia bumps. Also, my pores are actually appearing smaller.  I don't have sensitive skin at all, but it does dry out with some  products and was super dry using the green YTTP cleanser.  The smell is light and refreshing."

The fragrance is pretty strong, which I usually donu2019t like in skincare, but since itu2019s from natural ingredients, I can deal with it.  A little goes a long way. Iu2019ve found the sweet spot is about half a pump, just once or twice a week. Any more, and it might leave your skin feeling dry.

Benefits: This cleanser has a brightening effect, and I appreciated how it helped enhance my complexion over time. The papaya and vitamin C combination gives it a fresh scent and a natural feel, making it enjoyable to use.  Would I Buy It? Yes, I would consider repurchasing this product, especially for a once-daily routine.  Would I Recommend It? I would recommend this cleanser to friends and family, particularly those looking for a gentle exfoliant that promotes brightness in the skin. Just be aware of its drying properties, so it may not be suitable for very dry skin types. Overall, itu2019s a solid addition to any skincare routine."

Before trying this, I was a dedicated user of YTTP Superfood Cleanser and although that won't change, this Papaya + Vitamin C Cleanser will be a cleanser I plan to use consistently 2X a week indefinitely. For me personally, I think it may be a little too stripping to use every day but I had noticeably a difference in skin texture and lack of dullness after a few weeks of using it! I have combination/oily skin so if you had naturally dry skin I don't think you'd want to use this every day. I did receive this cleanser for free in exchange for my review, but I must say I will definitely be buying this in the future. YTTP is a company that is consistently on the top of their skincare game and always at a good price point for the fast results you see! 10/10 would recommend :)"

I was determined to make this product work for me because of the good ingredients it has. I am SO GLAD I stuck it out. I quickly learned that using this every day to exfoliate was a bit too much for my skin, but using it every other is GOLDEN!!!! My skin stays supple and moisturized, and this sloughs away all the flakes and dead skin leaving my complexion glowing and smooth. I absolutely LOVE IT!

I have dry and sensitive skin and donu2019t find the actives to be irritating personally, but I do use retinols so my skin is used to active ingredients, which may be why I didnu2019t experience the irritation that others have mentioned. My skin felt clean and soft after using and definitely looked pretty glowy. Although itu2019s relatively gentle, I would stick to the directions and use it 3x a week rather than as a daily cleanser to avoid over-exfoliating. I also only use it at night because the lactic acid and vitamin c can make skin more sensitive to the sun, so Iu2019d recommend using a high spf sunscreen if used as a morning cleanser. I took one star off because it is pretty heavily fragranced which typically isnu2019t my favorite, but it seems like a lot of the fragrance is natural since added fragrance is the last ingredient. The smell isnu2019t bad and just smells like citrus, so just a personal preference! Overall, I think this is a nice way to exfoliate and cleanse at the same time if you want to reduce the amount of products in your routine. If youu2019re newer to active ingredients, I think this would also be a good way to introduce your skin to them. However, I would just be aware that your skin may need a week or two to adjust before you get the best resultsu2014just be sure to use a good moisturizer after."

This exfoliating cleanser strikes a great balance between deep cleaning and being gentle enough for regular use.

After each wash, my face feels smooth, refreshed, and soft, without any tightness or drying. The scent is mild and refreshing, fruity but not overly sweet, and the formula doesnu2019t irritate or cause redness. Over time, Iu2019ve noticed my skin looks brighter, and the overall texture is much more even. Iu2019ve had fewer breakouts as well, likely due to the unclogging action of the exfoliants. Overall, this is a fantastic addition to any skincare routine, especially for those looking for a product that combines exfoliation with daily cleansing. It leaves your skin feeling clean, soft, and rejuvenated after every use. The glass bottle and cleanser color are also easy on the eyes! Highly recommend!"

I used it on my body for a week or so and was impressed with the improvement in texture.  I primarily use vitamin C in my skincare routine because of the pollution where I live. Iu2019m dubious of how effective a cleanser with vitamin C can be given that it is only on your skin briefly and then is washed off.

The scent is very distinct, fruity and smells refreshing. It's super easy to use with the pump handle, however, I don't quite need a full pump though. It makes my skin feel great right after use and all day long.

My fiance uses it on his face and really likes it and has no issues. There is a pleasant fruity scent too.

Sadly I was using this product in addition to salicylic acid and prescription tretinoin. I did not use this product every day since it is an exfoliate but I use my salicylic acid in the morning and tretinoin at night and I found adding this was just too drying for my skin, especially around my nose and upper cheek bone.

Many vitamin C cleansers can be harsh or leave my skin feeling tight, but this product strikes the perfect balance of being refreshing and nourishing.  Benefits: One of the major benefits of this cleanser is its ability to brighten the skin. The papaya enzymes work well to gently exfoliate, and Iu2019ve noticed a visible improvement in the texture and radiance of my skin. Itu2019s also formulated with superfruits, which makes it feel like Iu2019m feeding my skin with nutrients, not just cleaning it. Plus, itu2019s vegan, cruelty-free, and made from sustainable ingredients, which is a huge bonus for those conscious about what goes into their skincare products.  Would I buy it again? Definitely! While it is a bit more expensive than some drugstore alternatives, I feel the quality and results make it worth the investment. My skin feels smooth, looks brighter, and the cleanser has a luxurious feel that makes my skincare routine feel like a spa experience.  Recommendation: I would recommend this product to anyone looking for a gentle but effective cleanser, especially if youu2019re looking to target dullness or uneven texture. Itu2019s suitable for most skin types, and I think my friends and family would appreciate the clean ingredients and visible results."

It's made to even your skin tone and texture which I need because I get patches of dry skin almost everywhere  especially in fall/winter and no amount of lotions etc ever help it but for maybe an hour or so then back tk sandpaper city.  This product here though took that sandpaper skin of mine and totally revived it to how my skin should be I almost had to pinch myself I didn't believe it. Also it lasted . So that really blew my mind. This is a product where you are getting such great quality at a great value too , you just don't find that anymore.  This stuff is worth every penny. The papaya  scent of this is also great its not overwhelming its a subtle natural smell that I love and other people can smell it on me too and when getting out of the shower the scent itself is almost like aroma therapy  it calms and relaxs me.

It was so refreshing and enjoyable that it made washing my face a fun experience and easy to remember in my routine.  I started using it when I got home from two weeks of travel, where my skin was feeling dry and lackluster. With consistent use, morning and evening, I noticed a significant improvement in just three days. My skin was hydrated, soft, and happy.  I appreciate the label's recommendation to use for 30 seconds. This was crucial, especially considering the lactic acid exfoliant. Also really important to wear sunscreen, which I already do regularly and work indoors.  I got to try out this cleanser for free in exchange for my honest opinion. Overall, I highly recommend this cleanser. The combination of its pleasant scent, effective cleansing, and skin-reviving properties make it a must-have for anyone looking to improve their skincare routine. Gonna replace my dermalogica glycolic cleanser with this one. Another YTP winner!"

This cleanser also doesnu2019t dry my skin out afterwards like some other products would do to my skin. Just 1 note for everyone else is not to use a lot because thereu2019s acid in the ingredients.

On the first couple of uses, there was a slight warm/burning sensation. It was bearable, just a slight discomfort. The sensitivity went away. The cleanser left my face feeling tight and slightly dry. A moisturizer is definitely needed. My skin feels smoother and looks much brighter.  Extra bonus: My hands are a lot softer after applying this product to my face!"

I'll start off by saying that I have combination skin with an oily t-zone area and dry cheeks. My skin also tends to react sensitively to new products so I built my skin up to this cleanser by using it once a day for the first two days instead of their recommended twice a day. I also stuck to a very simple skincare routine of using a makeup remover balm, this Papaya cleanser, and then a moisturizer (in my case the belif moisturizing balm) to see an unbiased effect of the cleanser.  My thoughts after a full week and two days of receiving the product-- I'm pretty impressed with how it evened out my skin and especially minimized my pores and blackheads. I'm ngl, the cleanser burned a little bit on the first day because of the exfoliants but my skin got used to it and now it feels very gentle. The biggest game changer for me has been how much less pilling I have from sunscreen and makeup. Before, I was struggling immensely with that problem but found that the exfoliants in the cleanser have made my skin much smoother before makeup application. If you have dry skin areas like me though, I would highly recommend using a thicker moisturizer or more layers of your moisturer after using the cleanser because it can be drying. Overall, I think my before and after pictures speak for themselves and I'm definitely going to be using this until I finish the bottle!  Also the papaya scent is insanely good and I get so excited to use it every morning and night :)"

When I used it (it says to use twice a day) it felt like it almost burned a little bit. I didn't love this- but keep in mind I do have sensitive skin.  My skin absolutely felt more smooth and glowy when using this, but the burning just wasn't worth it for me.

This one changed my mind! Itu2019s a lovely gel that smells refreshing and while I did feel a slight tingle I experienced no reaction (massage it in for at least 30 seconds per directions). I have combo skin, so I was worried it might strip my skin, but it doesnu2019t and really is gentle in that way. The first few times I noticed my skin looked brighter, but what really made me a believer is seeing what it did when I used it while having a few minor blemishes. The next morning they were far less red and inflamed. With that said, if you are more sensitive maybe do a patch test first to be sure because the actives do work. Will definitely be keeping this in my routine!"

Immediately after using this cleanser for the first time my skin was red and textured and I donu2019t ever struggle with textured skin.  The red turned into a textured rash on my skin. After a couple days and the courage to try to product another time the redness subsided but the texture remained but now my skin on my chin hurts and burns anytime I put any product on it.  As Iu2019m writing this review the texture has turned into a huge patch of dryness on my skin and I also have never struggled with dryness to the point that my skin is peeling. In my opinion this product maybe would be better for someone with more oily skin and much less sensitive skin than me."

I suffer from eczema and rosacea on my face so I was a lottle concerned with how my face would handle it. It truly helped with my skin flaking. My redness started to go away and instead I had a healthy glow. However, you HAVE to make sure you apply sunscreen, because I suffered and should have known better with the AHAs.   Overall I will be repurchasing this cleanser. My skin feels amazing and it can be layered with my other skincare including my prescriptions. Use twice a day!"

And the ingredients they use are natural and makes my skin so nice and soft i have mostly oily skin but patches of dry (and sometimes still have acne) and being in my mid 30's im starting to get dryer skin under my eyes and it does wonders for it. It seems to be balancing out the oil and dry. Everyone has different skin but i know for us with scary sensitive skin itu2019s sometimes a bunmer to find things that dont break us out. Also, i think i must have read it wrong bc i thought they said it was a very light exfoliating wash as well."

It should be a nightmare for sensitive skin, and yet, I was pleasantly surprised to find it non-irritating for me, with some caveats.  No way am I washing my face with this twice a day, especially when I'm using tretinoin and other actives at night. I'm using it in my place of my normal salicylic morning cleanser three days a week. I am also using a ton of sunscreen.   I think this could be a good workhorse product, but there needs to be a lot of label reading and understanding of what your skin can tolerate."
