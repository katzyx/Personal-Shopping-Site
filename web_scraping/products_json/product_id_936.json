I highly recommend testing in store because of this. None of the shades are described as olive, but I found 240W to be pretty close to perfect for my olive undertone. It's described as light with warm peachy undertones, while 230W is described as light with warm yellow undertones. I feel they got this backward because when swatched next to each other, 230 is much more golden peach, and 240 clearly has a yellow/green tint to it. The foundation itself is medium/buildable coverage and feels very hydrating without feeling greasy. It applies smoothly and makes my skin look beautiful while still looking natural. I have oily skin, and it wore pretty well without making me look like an oil slick. The only slight downside is that it does transfer"

Iu2019ve been using a different foundation so didnu2019t notice until I went to use it last week and my skin broke out. I contacted customer service who told me to go to the store where I purchased it. ALL of the foundations were expired so they were going to refund me so I could purchase another but then was told they were unable to do anything because of the 60 day return policy. Now customer service is saying they are not able to do anything as well. I feel like the shelf life policy should out weigh the return policy but Sephora doesnu2019t so be sure to check the expiration on this one! Seems to be a common issue with this foundation at Sephora. I will be purchasing directly from Lancu00f4me from now on."

I used to exclusively buy Dior but haven't really worn makeup routinely since before the pandemic and Dior Forever foundation isn't known for standing up to the heat where I live now. Lancu00f4me's foundation doesn't feel as heavy but the coverage is much nicer. The medium coverage is nice because I can do my blush brighter and then my foundation, or my foundation first with lighter blush/highlighter on top. I can also use a brush or just my fingertip and it looks nice either way. Next up is to get the powder and concealer."

The foundation felt a little heavy at first but then felt very natural and like almost bare skin, not as though I had used a full coverage foundation. The reason for 2 stars is the smell of the product.  Its like you just sprayed perfume, and strong perfume at that. There are a lot of good things about this foundation but the scent used is way, way more than I want on my skin.  Will not be purchasing."

I absolutely love Lancome's tint idols wear foundation in 335w. As someone with a medium complexion, I often struggle to find a foundation that matches my skin tone perfectly. This product was the perfect match for me and blended seamlessly into my skin.  One of the things I love most about this foundation is that it did not break me out. I have sensitive skin, so finding a foundation that doesn't irritate my skin can be a challenge. Lancome's foundation did not cause any breakouts or irritation, which is a huge plus for me.  Additionally, this foundation is moisturizing without being oily. I have combination skin, so I often find that foundations can either be too drying or too greasy. Lancome's foundation struck the perfect balance and left my skin feeling hydrated without looking shiny.  Another great feature of this foundation is that it did not settle into fine lines. I have some fine lines around my eyes and mouth, and many foundations tend to accentuate them. However, Lancome's foundation did not settle into my fine lines and instead provided a smooth, flawless finish.  Overall, I highly recommend Lancome's tint idols wear foundation in 335w. It is the perfect match for medium complexion skin and offers a moisturizing, non-irritating formula that provides a flawless finish. I will definitely be repurchasing this product in the future."

Lancome claims that product is meant to u201chydrate and smooth skin for a natural-looking glow finish.u201d I would agree with this claim. There are a ton of shades to choose from including neutral, warm, and cool undertones, so that is also nice. The foundation lasted all day and did not transfer to my clothes, which I think is a very important quality in a liquid foundation. The included photos show that I have very fair, dry skin with lots of pigmentation, and the foundation evened out my skin tone and was natural looking. Again, I am very satisfied with this foundation."

Using a brush, the formula seemed to spread well and go a long way.  While I liked the way it blended away my dark spots, it seemed to accentuate the fine lines around my lips. What was terribly upsetting is that the shade was WAY off.  It was darker than advertised and instead of having pink undertones, turned me noticeably orange.  Unfortunately, this will not stay in my bag, it nor will it be recommended. And that smell!  Quite overwhelming perfume fragrance."

It glides on smoothly and evenly, doesn't crease, doesn't cause any breakouts, it lasts all day without needing to be reapplied, and if matched my skin tone perfectly.

I was really happy with the buikdabe coverage this provides, and I'm a fan of the healthy glow finish. Unfortunately, I had to choose my shade from a photo swatch and so the color was a bit too dark for my skin tone. Due to that I was very aware of the the foundation on my skin because it looked a tad off. I think if the color was a match then I would be happier overall with the product. This has an SPF of 27 which I think is pretty good for foundation, and because of this I would recommend it to a friend. There was some transfer onto my clothes, but it's hard to avoid that with a full face of foundation on. Lancome touted that you can get 24 hours of healthy glow foundation wearing, but I'm not sure I will need to test that as I wash my makeup off every night. I have not seen that from other companies, so if that is something you need then this is for you!"

I am NOT used to taking that a huge risk buying a foundation without being sure of the color given how Iu2019m a paper-white kinda gal with NO yellow undertones and not orange or pink either for that matter.  I am MORE than extremely fair... as in literally sheet almost transparent white to the extent where I can wear clown-white light as base (theatrical makeup) should I want to, only I prefer to save THAT for the stage because itu2019s not the lightest to wear! Iu2019m the gal who has that blueish undertone to my skin (my veins look very sky blue).  I typically choose the lightest colors of foundation & was thrilled that Lancome had a super fair shade that wasnu2019t peach or orange.  When I received the bottle of Teint Idole Ultra Wear Care & Glow Foundation, I was skeptical at first, but who wouldnu2019t be?  The shade looked like it might be too dark still, which has happened to me before, & it almost had a beige tone in the bottle. Donu2019t be fooled, though!  It was non- returnable so I figured I would give it a try on a day I wasn't doing anything special.  HOLY WOW - am I glad I did! I couldn't tell where Teint Idole Ultra Wear Care & Glow Foundation ended on my neck as I applied it!  The shade of Teint Idole Ultra Wear Care & Glow Foundation blended almost effortlessly and turned out sheer perfection!  Teint Idole Ultra Wear Care & Glow Foundation foundation is also extremely lightweight but manages to give a medium to full coverage. It applied smoothly over any imperfections my skin throws at me on a given day.  Teint Idole Ultra Wear Care & Glow Foundation did not oxidize or dry down to an oddball color like Iu2019ve had some do in the past.  Teint Idole Ultra Wear Care & Glow Foundation stayed perfect and in place all day and trust me, I work almost 12 hour days sometimes because I hold multiple positions, one of which involves travel.  I am so happy with my purchase of Teint Idole"

I have heard so many great things about Lancome's foundations so I was excited to be able to review the Lancome Teint Idole Ultra Wear Care & Glow Foundation. Starting with the positives I loved that the foundation provides a dual product by offering sunscreen protection as well as skincare benefits. I found this serum foundation to be weightless while being deeply hydrating. It felt like it plumped my skin for a flawless velvet finish which after researching I now know it's due to itu2019s hyaluronic and mandelic acid content which smoothens the skin the longer it settles into the skin. The finish looks so natural like my skin but with a healthy glow which I love! I usually donu2019t like serum foundations as they can come off as overly dewy and heavy after a couple hours of wear time but this foundationu2019s finish was more of a satin with luminous properties. I tested it in various conditions with my average being a 8 hour wear time in 70 degree weather which included running outside most days and can affirm that it's definitely sweat resistant since I usually get oily in my t-zone no matter how much mattifying powder I add but with this product I skipped on using powders to test out it's longevity and was very pleased with the results. I found it noteworthy to point out that the coverage is more of a light to medium coverage. I tried to use extra to conceal my problem areas i.e hyperpigmentation from acne spots or active acne but it did not conceal to full coverage so I would say itu2019s more like a tinted moisturizer to smoothen and even out your overall skin tone. Usually its very hard to match my skin tone but the 335 Warm shade blended so naturally into my skin tone. It's just missing is a slight olive undertone. If I could change anything I would like to see more olive undertone shades. Best For dry/mature skin year-round. Oily skin types might prefer it only in cooler months."

This is my new go to! I'm usually a matte, full coverage girl. But as I am getting older, I'm finding they really settle in my pores and fine lines. This foundation has solved all my problems! It really looks like my skin, just radiant! It doesn't settle in my pores or fine lines, but it covers my imperfections and redness. If makes me look and feel younger!

Since it is a glass bottle you need to make sure you shake it!  This foundation is definitely light to medium coverage. Not something I could use without primer and concealer. The liquid is incredibly thin and will drip so must be applied to your blender or other applicator. The color was perfect for my skin tone, because of the thin liquid it did not feel weighted on my skin which is very nice. It does have a perfume like smell to it, which for me was a bit too much scent. I would have to layer it with other things to use which is fine as my skin has blemishes. If I had smoother skin I would have loved this product except for the smell. If you use a light to medium foundation I would definitely recommend because it is light, blends very well, and is a dream to apply. If you use a thicker foundation or are opposed to scented makeup I would avoid. Also liked that it was dewy and not a fake looking matte. It was definitely a makeup to use if you donu2019t want to look like you are wearing make up. Iu2019m glad I got to try it, I still have to experiment using it with a primer and concealer. You can see from picture that it does remove redness and overall help the look of my skin."

It blends so well too, I use my hands or a makeup sponge but really you can apply it with anything because it goes on so well. I highly recommend!"

I really was not to sure on what shade to get. I was actually glad I got this shade because I don't look washed out.  I  am super excited I got the Lancu00f4me Teint Idole Ultra Wear Care & Glow Foundation because it is a good quality product. If you forgot your moisturizer no problem. In comparison to a regular foundation if you have dry skin it would be difficult to apply the foundation & for the foundation to spread well. If I don't use moisturizer with this Lancu00f4me Teint Idole it still spreads so easy. You can still use your moisturizer though & it isn't to much moisture. It's also lightweight and  medium coverage .It gives a natural look, it stays on well. I wore it one day and I thought surely since my face got wet the foundation would be gone completely. But, to my amazement I still had foundation on when  I looked in a mirror.  I also don't have to use but a couple very small pumps of the foundation and a little goes a long way.  The hylaronic acid and mandelic acid are a good combination if you have dry or mature skin and also just in general.  The combination is great to help plump the skin and help keep it moisturized. This combination also helps to blur fine lines ,wrinkles, get rid of acne & enlarged pores , even out skin tone, & get rid of dark spots. It also helps your skin get brighter more radiant. It also has a Rose smell, it smells great. This foundation is definitely something you should try out !  I also plan on getting more of it when I'm done with this bottle !"

I have tried it with and without primer and feel that with primer, it offers a full coverage look, whereas without primer, it has a nice medium coverage. I prefer to use it without for a more natural look. While wearing it throughout the day, it doesn't settle into my fine lines, nor does it crease. Instead, I feel as though it provides a beautiful natural, healthy glow. With ingredients such as hyaluronic acid and mandelic acid, I've noticed an improvement in the way my skin looks and feels after about a month of continuous use. This foundation also offers sun protection with an SPF of 27 which is a great combination given that it contains mandelic acid. (which can cause sun sensitivity) Even though it has sunscreen in the formula it doesn't have the normal sunscreen smell, instead, it offers a light floral scent which personally I love.  Overall, this is truly an excellent foundation with many skin-loving ingredients that can benefit all skin types."

After giving the bottle a good shake to mix the ingredients, I went right in with my fingers all over my face and was ready to go. This is a buildable foundation which I appreciate and I didnu2019t feel the need to keep applying. I love the way it made my aging skin look and feel.

I had to repeatedly shake it multiple times to get it mixed together. I ordered my usual shade which is light medium and it was definitely darker than expected. I used my usual primer underneath and the foundation didnu2019t even stay on throughout my makeup application. Smudged very easily. I donu2019t know if it was just a bad batch or if this is the way it is supposed to be. Like I said I am a huge Lancu00f4me fan and will still purchase other products just definitely not this oneu2639ufe0f"

It wears naturally throughout the day without setting spray and it did not crease on me. Great for everyday use."

The first time I wore it I got compliments on how good my makeup looked, I wear makeup everyday so there was a noticeable difference between this and my usual routine. The foundation lasted as well. I work ~13 hour nights and my makeup still looked pretty good at the end of my shift. The only con for this foundation is the scent.

It has a dewy finish that blurs my pores. The best part is that I can have a dewy finish without any greasy residue. It didn't breakout my skin which was another surprise. I thought that it might breakout my skin because of the dewyness to it but thankfully it didn't. It's long-lasting too. I didn't have any issues with flaking or lifting.

It has a very light and subtle floral scent that I really enjoy, and it's not overbearing at all. Scent is not normally one of the first things that crosses my mind when it comes to foundations, but it's a very pleasant surprise that they went the extra mile with this product to include that detail. Especially considering that it also has SPF 27 in its formula. It's long lasting, and with my personal experience, it looks better the longer I wear it. I also like how well it conceals my dark circles and unwanted redness. No issues with sensitivity or breakouts either. I also appreciate that it stays put without rubbing off on things. My cat likes to rub on my face when I least expect it, but fortunately I had no issues of makeup getting anywhere I didn't intend it to. Overall, I can definitely see myself adding this to my beauty routine and would recommend."

A huge plus, as my previous foundation was discontinued! My search for a replacement led me to try many products, including Lancu00f4me Teint Idole Ultra Wear Care & Glow Foundation.  Upon opening the bottle, I did a quick color match without prepping my skin. Without primer, the foundation felt slightly chalky and lacked smoothness sitting on the skin. This worried me. However, with primer the next day, it glided on significantly better and applied smooth and consistently. The medium-thickness consistency allows for buildable coverage. It even earned me my first makeup compliment in a while!  Overall, I'm leaning positive toward this product. My mature skin has normal moisture, small pores, and no significant wrinkles for the foundation to settle into, so I can't speak to its performance under those conditions. Is it my final replacement - it's definitely a strong maybe."

It does dry a little too matte so we just had a cold front and my skin was extra dry and you can see this matte sitting on my skin so make sure to moisturize well if you have dry skin. Color matching was super easy with their chart as well and I found my exact match. Love that this has spf, hyaluronic acid, mandelic acid, and rose balm. All great things for you skin and itu2019s skincare too. I normally have sensitive skin and this was light enough and gave me no reactions. By the way it is lighted scented like the normal Lancu00f4me products and it smells soo good and not over powering."

I didnu2019t need much to get a decent coverage. But itu2019s not cakey or thick. Itu2019s a subtle layer that gives your skin a healthy glow while covering blemishes and dark spots.  It keeps your skin looking hydrated and healthy. It lasted all day and had the wonderful benefit of being spf 30. I wore it all day at a festival and it protected my face well and still looked fresh hours later. My only complaint is it was a bit darker than I expected. Itu2019s not horrible and blended easily but I could have gone a shade lighter."

When I first  opened the package, I was worried it would be too dark for my skin, but it doesn't oxidize at all, so it worked out fine. It will be the perfect shade as I get more sun with the warmer weather of spring. On first pump, the scent was overwhelming, and I honestly wasn't even sure I wanted to even put it on my face. But I wanted to give a thorough, honest review since that's what I signed up for, so I went ahead and used it, and I'm so glad I did! The smell fades relatively quickly, and the foundation wears so beautifully! The first time I wore it, I tried it by itself with no primer or powder or anything. It isn't quite matte, but it isn't too wet looking, either. It's a wonderful, natural finish that lasted all day. The next time, I did a full face of makeup and really put it to the test with a 14+ hour crazy busy day. I am a photographer and it even made it through an outdoor photoshoot in 75 degrees. It never got patchy or caked on my glasses. I was a little oily by the end of the day as you can see in picture 2, but I was super impressed by its performance. I definitely recommend trying out this foundation for yourself. It took me two pumps to get medium coverage, or I could just use one for light coverage."

Unfortunately, the foundation did wear off at about the 5th hour, it caused some shine, more than I am used to. Nothing some powder can't help.

I do feel like the shade in the box and the bottle don't match up that well and didn't notice a glow but other than that it's grate. This glow and care foundation blends very well and has this satin finish, it leaves a grate skin-like finish, and feels weightless. In my opinion I do think it has a smell but I really did enjoy the smell it had. This glow and care foundation provides light to medium coverage as well as contains sunscreen and hyaluronic acid. Im using this more as a tinted moisturizer rather than as a sunscreen. How I use it is by moisturizing, priming, and adding sunscreen; then go in with 2 pumps of the glow and care and with a flat brush i spread it all around my face; then I take a beauty blender and blend it out, and set it with some powder; and either I leave it like that or decide to glam it up.

The foundation itself blends out extremely well, plus itu2019s really light on the skin making it feel weightless. The coverage is a nice medium, totally buildable and looks natural aside from clinging to some dryness. Overall great foundation, Iu2019d like to try it on a lighter shade next time to have a better match for winter months."

The medium coverage is buildable, allowing me to customize my desired level of coverage without feeling heavy or cakey.

Iu2019m using this as more of a foundation or tinted moisturizer than as my standalone daily sunscreen. After I wash and put Black Girl Sunscreen on, I apply my Lancu00f4me with a flat brush (found it much less messy than my hands) and usually set with some powder. This stuff will transfer. The skin-like finish is amazing; can be worn standalone or as part of the dayu2019s beat. Because of the hydrating hyaluronic acid and the SPF (which all SPFs usually recommend reapplying throughout the day), I found my first couple of uses to soak into my skin after a few hours. Because I use this as a base, some powder and setting spray help delay the fade. Overall, Iu2019m a fan, feels great for every day, and can be zhuzhed up for a full or bare face with some great skincare benefits. Iu2019m excited to use this in the summer!"

            "review_text": "I recently tried the Lancu00f4me TIU Care & Glow Foundation in the shade 335w, and while there are some aspects I appreciate about this product, there are a couple of drawbacks that I believe potential buyers should be aware of.  Let's start with the positive aspects. The packaging is elegant and convenient, with a pump dispenser that allows for easy application. The foundation also promises a care and glow formula, suggesting skincare benefits along with a radiant finish.  However, I found that the shade 335w turned out to be a bit too warm for my skin tone. This made it challenging to achieve a natural look, as the foundation appeared noticeably warm and didn't blend seamlessly with my complexion. If you have a cooler undertone, I would recommend trying a different shade or getting a sample before committing to a full-size product.  Another notable downside for me was the texture of the foundation. I found it to be on the dry side, making it difficult to blend evenly. The formula lacks the smooth, creamy texture that I typically look for in a foundation. This dryness made the application process less enjoyable, and I had to spend more time blending to achieve a more even finish.  Despite these drawbacks, the foundation did provide decent coverage, and once blended properly, it did impart a subtle glow to my skin. If you have oily skin, you might appreciate the matte finish it offers, but those with dry or combination skin may find the formula less forgiving.  In conclusion, the Lancu00f4me TIU Care & Glow Foundation in shade 335w has its merits, but the warmth of the color and the dry texture may pose challenges for some users. It's crucial to consider your skin type and undertone before purchasing this product. If possible, try a sample first to ensure it meets your expectations and complements your skin tone."

Blended out nicely with both a sponge and brush (I prefered a sponge for lighter coverage and a brush for a little more coverage). Would agree it is medium buildable. The  2 downsides for me are the price ($59) and the fragrance as I feel it has irritated my face while testing it the last week and a half. There are other foundations that do the same thing for less money. If you don't mind fragrance and like medium coverage foundations and the price is not an issue, give it a try. As for myself, I would not repurchase."

            "review_text": "I have the original Ultra Wear foundation so I was excited to try out the Care and Glow to compare the two.  - Constistency - The original foundtion is more liquidy. When I originally received the Care and Glow, there was some seperation, I'm not sure if it was because it had been sitting for a while or you do have to shake it up. The consistency is a lot thicker than the original which I thought was interesting considering it is a more dewy finish.  - Coverage - Both I would categorize medium-full coverage. I would say with the Care and Glow allows for a little of your skin to peek through, but again very buildable.  - Finish - The original ultra wear has a neutral-matte finish which is nice if someone is looking for something not too dewy or matte. The Care and Glow I would say is just one step above that in dewiness, which is nice if you're looking for that type of finish.  - Oxidation. Both lines oxidize which can be a bit annoying if you're purchasing online. Based on my foundation color, they oxidize more on the pink side.  - Shade range - One thing I don't like about both lines is they don't have many shades with olive undertones. I have a warm/olive undertone, and although they do have shades that are warm, along with the oxidation, they end up with a more pink finish which is very annoying. For this reason I have to add a green pigment to the foundation in order to properly color match it.  - Performance - As I've used the original for quite a while now, I can say it does hold up in terms of performance as it's long wearing and relatively stays put. I think the Care and Glow is very similar in that it is long wearing. However, some reviews say it's not as long wearing as the original so that's something to keep in mind.  Overall I really like the foundation. I would probably wear this in the summer months when I want something with more of a hydrated/dewy finish. I'm giving it 4 stars due to the lack of olive undertones in the shade range."

I also haven't had luck with hydrating/glow foundations on my combo skin with oily T zone. I received this is 105W and was truly surprised by it, as I'd never chose a W/warm tone. Its not a perfect match for my pasty winter skin, but it's totally doable! And will probably be perfect for summer when I use a bit of tanner on my face. I've applied with a dense rounded brush and a flat top brush, using just barely more than one pump. Spreads easily and gives a nice medium coverage that tones down my redness just right without needing additional concealer. The finish is slightly velvety and SO BEAUTIFUL. Looks natural and doesn't settle too bad into creases. Feels very light and comfortable on the skin. Im super sensitive and haven't had any reaction to this. I'm really pleased with how it looks and wears and I have been reaching for it every day, despite several other new foundations in my kit! All that said, it's not perfect. On my combo skin, it does start to break up a bit around the oily parts and need some attention after 5-6 hours. So it's not gonna be a long wear choice for combo skin. Other odd thing is that while it is SPF 27, the sun protection ingredient only protects against on kind of UV radiation, requiring that you use an additional product for full spectrum. So then...why bother to put it in? Its just going to make ppl think they are protected when they really aren't. Those things aside, I do like the look and I'm impressed by a glow foundation that I can actually wear. Would recommend for everyone except oily!"

The foundation seemed to cling to any dry patches I had and had a very strong perfume scent. I did try to use the foundation after thoroughly exfoliating and moisturizing to prevent any clinging. While that did help, I did notice separation around my nose after a few hours. I plan to try it with a different primer to see if that will help.

The first time I used it, I applied a light non-greasy moisturizer before applying Tint Idole Ultra Wear Care and Glow and had the results I was looking for. This foundation has a serum that helps to hydrate the skin. When you open the box, the first thing you read is instructions about shaking the bottle well before each use. Theyu2019re not exaggerating when they said to shake it well, because you will pump a bigger amount of serum if you donu2019t shake it well. This is a lightweight makeup that feels like a moisturizer because on top of giving me the glow look, it also improved the appearance of my skin. This makeup also spreads evenly and doesnu2019t enhance my few dry spots because I have combination skin. I donu2019t waist any foundation because I just pump two times and get enough for my face and neck area, a little goes a long way. It helps me hide the imperfections on my skin without clogging my pores. I donu2019t have to apply sunscreen with this makeup because it has SPF 27 but I will reapply it if I stay outdoors for more than two hours. I love that my complexion looks great and hydrated all day long. This foundation definitely became the number one on my list! I received this product for free in exchange for my honest review."

I have been using this foundation for a few weeks and I really like it. It has a lightweight and creamy texture that blends easily and feels comfortable on the skin. It has a medium coverage that evens out my skin tone and covers minor imperfections, without looking cakey or heavy. It has a dewy finish that gives my skin a healthy and luminous look, without being too shiny or oily.  The foundation lasts for a long time on my skin, without fading or settling into fine lines. It does not oxidize or change color throughout the day. It also does not irritate or dry out my skin, but rather keeps it soft and smooth. It comes in a variety of shades that suit different skin tones and undertones.  Overall, I think Lancome TEINT IDOLE ULTRA WEAR CARE & GLOW is a great product for people who want a foundation that provides a natural and radiant glow, while also protecting and hydrating the skin. It has a lightweight and creamy texture, a medium coverage, a dewy finish, and a long-lasting formula. It is expensive, but it is worth the investment. I would recommend it to anyone who is looking for a high-quality and luxurious skincare foundation."

Due to the generous size of the sample, I've been able to try it several different times now, in different conditions.  The PROS: I got a really good match with my skin tone using their color card (Color 104W for fair with warm yellow undertones)  The product is unscented and comes in a very nice pump bottle, which allows you to dispense just a tiny amount at a time.  I love the SPF added (SPF 27), though I would use more serious sunscreen for a day outside  The finish doesn't make me look greasy (a plus because my T-Zone is actually a disaster zone)  It does a decent job of toning down the red on my cheeks (from sun damage and a very mild case of rosacea). I still had to use some mineral powder on top though.  It didn't upset my very sensitive skin  The CONs: This is probably more a problem with my skin than with the product but I did find that it settled into every pore and fine line and gave me that weird dry skin appearance. To be fair, I have this problem with most foundations because my pores are terrible (fine lines not too bad). I had this problem even after applying an industrial sized application of high end primer. I will say that I discovered a good trick while testing this foundation -- if you get the stuff stuck in your pores, blotting all over with a charcoal blotting sheet seems to clear up a lot of the problem.  Overall, I'll probably keep trying it until I use up the bottle, as long as that blotting sheet trick keeps working. Still on a quest to find a foundation that doesn't settle into my pores."

The color description does not match the actual color which I saw on a couple other reviews. Make sure you color match in person before buying. The fragrance is really nice and I did not find it overpowering even though I usually buy fragrance free options. The foundation went on smoothly and definitely has buildable coverage. I dont know if it is worth the money as the color mis-match was very distracting and caused me not to use it as often.

I took off a star because the shade and the ligher shades (I went in store to swatch other shades then the one I received to confirm) do tend to run very dark compared to the original Teint Idole line. That being said I think I prefer the original Teint Idole Foundation to this one in terms of finish, wear, and longevity. This one while nice, just doesnu2019t compare to the original which after the reformulation I believe leans a bit more hydrating anyway and has a better shade range. For the price I would recommend trying the original Lancome foundation unless you can be color matched to a shade you like a lot in this one!

I used a foundation brush and a beauty blender to test the blending. It does blend with ease with either tool. However, I did find that it was a light coverage. If you are wanting more of a full coverage then this isnu2019t for you. With that being said, I was very pleased with this foundation. My skin looked natural with a glow finish."

I got the color of this foundation at 325C. I shared it well before use! It has a floral scent! Be honest! This color is too dark for my skin tone! The texture is very lightweight! This foundation with medium coverage by using it alone! I tried two methods, I use my finger to put foundation, second method, I use the blender to put it on. I like the second method better. It can help to blend well better! Looks more natural! Looks flawless! I love how it feels on the skin, not greasy, not feel dry! Feels hydrating! On the second day, based on the color too dark when I tested before, I put a a lighter tone loose power on top, it fit perfectly! I wish I can get a perfect color match on my skin tone, that way it will look more natural when used alone! I recommend this product to my friends."

It has great coverage, especially when applied with a foundation brush or dabbed on with a dry sponge.  A damp sponge lends to a medium coverage, dewy finish, and finger application is a light coverage - just as the brand states in the description.  It lasted all day, even through workouts, no issues with transference, and it didn't settle into creases or fine lines.  This is one I'll keep reaching for."

Iu2019ve used both a brush and a sponge to apply and both work well, but I prefer to use a brush for more coverage. It blends seamlessly and doesnu2019t leave brush strokes. It also doesnu2019t sit in my fine lines and doesnu2019t enhance my pores. I can get solid medium coverage that lasts me the whole day. It doesnu2019t oxidize and it doesnu2019t transfer.  To say a natural finish is pretty accurate. On my skin, itu2019s like a satin matte with a slight glow to the skin. I was worried it would be greasy or shiny and itu2019s not at all. Itu2019s like the original teint idole ultra wear, but with a little less coverage and a little more youthfulness, if that makes sense.  Itu2019s a winner!!

I wore it for 8/ hours and tried with both primer and no primer. With no primer I think it made me look a little too oily so I had to keep powder with me. With a matte primer I loved it. By the end of the night I was only a little oily in the T zone. It also has more fragrance than I like but if you like fragrance youu2019ll love this.

This is quite a large bottle of foundation to start. The packaging in my opinion could be a little more luxurious for what this costs as full price, but not a big deal.  The texture of the foundation is light and airy, so easy to apply with any tool you prefer (I used a beauty blender).  On the skin, it was so skin like and comfortable,  I set with a finishing powder.  The color match was perfect 400w and Iu2019m normally a C6 or NC42 in MAC.  I typically have a hard time matching my olive, deep warm skintone, but this one was nearly exact.  Big fan of this foundation and will continue to use overtime.

I applied about 2-3 pumps worth of product with my fingers & it dried quickly. For those that are sensitive to fragranced products, note that this foundation has a rose/floral scent. Itu2019s a light to medium scent that eventually disappears. Iu2019d purchase this foundation because it feels lightweight on my skin, the sunscreen is built into it, I can use it for light to medium coverage depending on how I feel that day, & the foundation gives me a great, natural, fresh look. Itu2019s so lightweight that I forgot that I had it on & fell asleep. It didnu2019t even rub off on my pillows. This is great foundation, especially for people with combination and oily skin. If you are on the drier side, like me, be sure to use a moisturizer before applying the foundation so your face doesnu2019t feel too dry."

One thing Lancome does like no other brand is they incorporate new tech and scientific finds into their products. This foundation feels like a serum! I've never felt anything like it! My skin LOVES it! And my makeup loved it, too! I use luxury makeup brands like Lancome for all my products, and I am SO impressed with this new Teint Idole Ultra Wear Care & Glow Foundation! It feels SO good on my skin. I used it after I prepped my skin as usual. My skin is sensitive, combo, acne prone, problematic at times, angry skin. Since COVID, I cut back a lot on makeup and skincare products I don't need or use. But I use foundation. And this is the best, most buildable, invisible, incredible foundation! Can't believe how well it blended AND how easy my makeup blended, too! I think my makeup looked better because of this foundation! This is a product I'll be stocking up on! The bottle is gorgeous. I love the gold-embossed top. It looks super luxe on any shelf. I used 105W, and I usually wear a 120 or 140 in Neutral. But this just looked so good on my skin from the very first use! It blends like a facial lotion more than a matte or heavy foundation. I'd wear this if it was just a stand alone product, that's how good it made my skin look! It blended seamlessly and effortlessly. I used my finger to get the feel of it, and I'll continue to do so. That's how easy it blends! It also covers exceedingly well. I was shocked something that felt this good on would cover so well. And it covered my face perfectly! I have redness, spots, uneven skin tone, and this is the first and ONLY foundation that ever covered all my skin completely and totally! This new Lancome Teint Idole Ultra Wear Care & Glow Foundation is the best foundation ever because it doesn't feel like makeup. I was given this product in exchange for an honest review. Recommend to anyone that wants to go & glow!"

This is so lightweight, it really feels like youu2019re not wearing anything. I was impressed with how great my skin looked at the end of the day without any touch ups.

I used this over the last full week, and I loved it. First off, some info about my skin - its combination, with some redness throughout, sensitive, and with a smattering of freckles. I used a beauty blender for the application, and it applied so smoothly.  As its a buildable coverage, I went back and added a bit more on an area of my cheekbone with more redness, and my chin, as I tend to touch that area more through the day.  It built great in these areas, while still looking natural and allowing my freckles to show through. I absolutely loved the glow it gave my skin without having to add in extra products to the mix.  I love the SPF coverage, and even more than I can't smell it, or feel any additional heaviness that sometimes comes with this level of SPF 27 added in. It made my skin feel hydrated through the day, and there was no flaking or settling into the fine lines around my eyes and mouth.  I purposely picked this week to test it out as I started my week at a business conference with 16 hour days, and ended it back in the office, and kicking off the weekend with hosting a birthday party for my 8 year old.  The foundation kept going on each of those days, well past when I was ready to call it a day. This is a product I am looking forward to adding into my makeup routine, and am already investigating my summer shade."

No oxidizing or yellow/orange pigment. Thatu2019s a win since almost every warm foundation turns orange on me. The only negative for me is that the coverage is more light-medium than what Iu2019m used to.

Taking the lid off I discovered it was a pump bottle which I felt was a positive. The lotion/foundation came out smoothly and was easy to apply. I used color 105W for fair skin with warm/yellow undertones and it covered very well without feeling heavy. I often have a redness to my skin and this foundation helped to conceal it without issue. The coverage also lasted throughout the day. Another big plus is that this product has an SPF 27 which I am grateful for in the protection of my skin as I 'mature'. I liked this product and feel it will be a great product to use during the upcoming warmer months. A big thank you to Lancome, Sephora and Skeepers for allowing me to try this product for free in exchange for my honest opinion. It will be a great skin protector and coverage all in one."

It took time, but now with Teint Idole Ultra Wear, I am saving time (which is so precious for all of us especially in the morning) and money- because I do not need additional cosmetics like SPF cream, toner, or hyaluronic acid- everything is infused in the product!

I've tried everything from drugstore to high-end brands from Sephora and Ulta (my most recent purchase being a MAC foundation). This blew the MAC foundation I was previously using out of the water. This foundation feels lightweight, is truly buildable and covers like a full-coverage foundation. It feels hydrating but doesn't leave me oily. It also looks natural but lasts all day! Not kidding, I haven't stopped using this since I got it. I won't be purchasing anything other than this product moving forward. I'm in LOVE!

The Lancu00f4me Teint Idole Ultra Wear Care & Glow Foundation in shade 335W is a standout product.  The serum foundation is great and easy to blend, and it is buildable.  I personally use a foundation brush to apply, and it is perfect.  I use the foundation after applying a primer and finish the look with setting spray.  It feels nonexistent on my skin, makes me glow, and look pretty close to flawless.  I can't wait to use this product in the spring and summer because it has SPF, and i spend a lot of time outside.  My skin still feels light, airy ,and hydrated.  This foundation provides pretty good coverage, and also offers nourishing skincare benefits. The formula is pretty long-wearing and lightweight, and feels pretty comfortable throughout the day.  I was surprised how perfect shade 335W was for me, and I was super pleased with the color match.  I will say, it is definitely fragranced and kind of strong smelling.  I personally didn't mind it at all, but I know others might not prefer strong fragrances.  Also, I wouldnt say it is 24 hour or super long-lasting.  It would get a little cakey and start coming off in spots by the end of the day.  I do have acne scars and large pores so I know nothing is or ever will be perfect.  Overall,  this foundation looks and makes me feel beautiful, helps me care for my skin, and gives the perfect glow.  I highly recommend this foundation for many different skin types."

I experienced some difficulty when trying to cover my acne breakouts with it. Hence, I gave it a 4-star rating instead of 5.

This foundation looks beautiful, and if I pair it with the right primer and face powder, it lasts my entire work day, 9 plus hours. It does break down, but it does so in a graceful way and still looks good at the end of the day. I have found it to have little to no transfer as well. I'm still working in an atmosphere where a face mask is required, and any transfer is quite minimal. It's a fairly liquidy and serum like foundation, and you can apply it pretty much anyway you like. I have tried a number of different application techniques. All of which worked, but applying it with my fingers seems to work best for me. I do have one buffing brush, which left it a little streaky, but I tapped it out with my sponge, and it looked amazing. It melts right into the skin and not only does it apply easily and quickly, but it sets down and just looks stunning. I have yet to find a setting powder that it disagrees with as well. I will say I don't find it to be medium coverage. You might be able to build it up to medium, but I find its coverage to be perfect for me. I do have a bit of hyperpigmentation and discoloration, and it seems to cover that up nicely. It is glowy and makes my skin look super healthy, but if I'm going for a more matte look, with the right primer and powder, it doesn't disappoint. I find it has little to no transfer as well. I'm still working in an atmosphere where I'm required to wear a face mask daily, and any transfer is quite minimal. It pairs well with all of my skin care, sunscreen, and primers, and although it does contain its own sunscreen, Ensulizole, I always feel a bit safer applying my own. This foundation checks all the boxes for me. I highly recommend it, and I will absolutely be purchasing."

The coverage is on the lighter sign so keep that in mind. The foundation has long-staying power with little to no touch-ups throughout the day (some days I have to add powder throughout the day).

I usually preffer to wear make up that is buildable, so I can work more in my problem areas like sun spots, rosacea flare ups, and blemishes. I find the tent Idole a great buildable foundation. It doesn't feel heavy on the skin or drying. The only reason why I subtracted a star is because it is not as long lasting on it's on as I would preffer. To make it last all day I had to either add a primer and a setting spray, or a setting powder at the end.

The bottle is pretty large and I love the pump dispenser. I applied the smallest amount, about the size of pea, with my fingertips and blended out. At first it looked orangey and too dark, but it easily blended in and looked pretty good. Iu2019m not sure this is the right color for me still, but it does look radiant and adds a much needed boost of color to my pale winter skin. It really feels great on the skin, very moisturizing and feels like a treatment, not drying effects or itchiness with this one. It looks vey radiant but not glittery , dewy but not oily, and has a buildable medium coverage. I would recommend this product, if possible get it in person so you can see the many colors available."

As someone with dry skin who loves a natural, radiant finish, this product has truly impressed me.  Firstly, let's talk coverage. The medium coverage provided by this foundation strikes the perfect balance for me. It effectively conceals blemishes while feeling weightless on the skin. What's remarkable is its serum-like texture u2013 it effortlessly blends in, leaving behind a luminous finish that mimics natural skin texture.  The shade I received (445N) was slightly lighter than my preference, but the finish and skincare benefits made up for it. I'm considering purchasing a darker shade for the warmer months ahead, but for now, I'm perfectly content with this one.  One of the standout features of this foundation is its hydrating properties. As someone with dry skin, I appreciate how it left my skin feeling hydrated throughout the day.   In conclusion, I would highly recommend this foundation to anyone looking for a medium coverage foundation with a radiant finish. Whether you have dry skin or simply love a natural glow, this product ticks all the boxes. This foundation has earned a permanent spot in my makeup routine."

            "review_text": "Shade 335W was an absolute dream match for my skin tone. As someone with warm undertones, finding a foundation that doesn't oxidize or turn orange throughout the day is always a challenge. However, this shade was spot on from the moment I applied it to the end of the day.  Texture-wise, this foundation is heavenly. It has a lightweight, silky texture that blends effortlessly into the skin. I prefer applying it with a damp sponge for a more natural, skin-like finish, and it glides on like a dream. Despite its lightweight feel, it offers fantastic coverage, evening out my skin tone and concealing any imperfections without looking cakey.  I have oily skin, so I'm always skeptical about claims of long-wear formulas, but this one truly delivers. It stays put all day without slipping or fading, even in humid weather. Plus, it has a beautiful luminous finish that gives my skin a healthy glow without looking greasy."

The coverage is a solid medium coverage but itu2019s buildable, so I was able to apply all over and hit my age spots a little harder while keeping a nice, natural glow. Make sure to shake really well before applying. They use a serum base that is excellent for hydration, but it tends to settle a bit. A few good shakes and itu2019s fine.

It's not super thick because it is mean't to be more sheer (I believe). It does have a perfume-y like smell but I think a lot of lancome's products have that. I'm a bit sensitive to smells so it wasn't my favorite at first, however the scent wears off during the day. I like the lightweight feel, I did find I could build it a little. I definitely feels like it gives a little glow. It kinda reminds me of a tinted moisturizer except maybe a little bit more foundation-y? I absolutely love that it's got the SPF in it and doesn't feel like sunscreen. Even though the product has the hyaluronic acid it seemed to be a little drying for me but its not a game changer, I think the spf protection can make any product a tiny bit dry so I don't fault it for that. As far as color goes, I'm a tad disappointed. I'm pretty fair and have neutral undertones. The most fair shade available was only in a warm undertone so it's a smidge off from my natural tone. This also wasn't a huge dealbreaker as my skin will tan a little come the summer months and will blend a little better. Overall I really like the product. I've worn it everyday and have not had any skin problems like breakouts, etc. Somedays I forget I'm wearing it! I think if they had a few more color choices and different undertones I'd buy it for sure."

I just wish it came in lighter shades!! I'm an extremely pale girl I always choose my foundation color by choosing the lightest shade available, however this wasn't it, it is way too dark for my skin tone I thought I chose the lightest shade available. Which is way I gave this foundation only 4 stars. If they start making lighter shades in the future I'll definitely be purchasing this as my new go to foundation!   This is honestly one of the best foundations I have ever used!! I had to figure out what products work best with this foundation since it is silicone based. Make sure you use a primer that is also silicone based and not water based. I found it also works great without a primer!    I have extremely oily skin and a lot of redness aswell as large pores and uneven texture. This foundation covered all of my redness and it also gave me a nearly poreless face!! I set it with loose setting powder and setting spray and it lasted me all day with zero shine!! It didn't separate around my nose and chin like most other foundations do. It stayed absolutely flawless! I'm 38 and it didn't settle into my fine lines either!! Best foundation ever and I'm a foundation snob!! I just wish it came in lighter shades!!   Photos are with no setting powder just freshly applied foundation without primer! I know it's not my color it's way too dark but the coverage is amazing!"

I actually thought it settled and I needed to shake it a lot, but it didnu2019t work - it still comes out like oily water and runs off if youu2019re not careful. Lastly, it broke me out in tiny itchy bumps with white tops. They went away in a day so itu2019s not like acne. My skin is on the oily side with some dryness around my nose, but not sensitive at all.

I appreciate that I can get a light coverage with this. It wears all day, doesn't settle into lines or accuente any flaws. I don't wear primer or powder and this holds up on my normal to slightly oily skin. The major high point for this foundation is that my face actually feels great at the end of the day. So the skincare aspect of it must be doing its job.   The main thing that I don't like is the fragrance. I typically don't mind it in products but this is strong. It does dissipate eventually.

SPF does expire so knowing when the SPF is no longer useful is such a great help!! It has a very light and subtle floral scent that does not linger. It's not a scent that I notice after a few seconds. Fragrance and scents in foundations are not a big deal to me. In my personal experience, the foundation looks better the longer I wear it.

The instructions emphasize shaking the bottle well, and for good reason. The first few pumps came out quite runny, raising some initial concerns. However, after shaking it more vigorously, the product dispensed perfectly. This foundation is wonderfully lightweight, perfect for achieving a natural, no-makeup makeup look. It also offers buildable coverage, allowing me to easily layer it for greater coverage. Blending is a dream, and the finish is a beautiful, luminous glow that doesn't look oily or overly dewy. Additionally, other products layer seamlessly on top u2013 my contour and blush blended flawlessly into the foundation, creating a look I loved.  Throughout the day, the foundation held up remarkably well. While some wear was noticeable by nightfall, it still looked fantastic after a full day's wear. The inclusion of skincare ingredients is a welcome bonus, especially the SPF that makes it a summer must-have. Plus, the hyaluronic acid provides welcome hydration and skincare benefits.  Overall, this foundation has become my new go-to, and I highly recommend it!"

Pros:  It blends out beautifully, stays on (and stays looking fresh) ALL DAY, and resists transfer AMAZINGLY well! I literally was able to take a paper towel and press it against my face with hardly any transfer at all, and that was after wearing the foundation for at least 8 hours! Not only is all of this true, it also does feel very hydrating but not greasy (and I have dry skin, especially in the winter), and is incredibly lightweight and comfortable to wear. In fact, it is so skin like that I have forgotten that I had it on until looking in the mirror and going WOW!   Cons: It DOES oxidize. For me, this actually turned out to be a good thing because I got a shade that was a bit too light for me, but between the oxidation and a little blush and bronzer, it ended up looking absolutely perfect, but this is something to be aware of in case you are trying to decide between two shades - go with the lighter one! It also does have a floral fragrance that bothered me a bit at first because it is a little strong when you first open the bottle and pump it out, but it dissipates fairly quickly.   Overall, I absolutely LOVE this foundation. It is a true medium coverage that feels silky with the perfect consistency, is easy to apply and wears well. The packaging is beautiful, although I do wish that cap weren't white to make it look a bit sleeker and less drugstore, but the pump works great and the glass feels substantial. Shades can be a bit tricky, so do a color match and get samples of 2 or 3 if you can. Absolutely would highly recommend!"

Something to first note is that the product has a serum-like liquid consistency due to this I'd recommend applying with your fingers if you want to maintain the best coverage ( which isn't my go-to ) vs brushes ( at least those in my disposal ) due to a streaky I found or sponge alone which I found absorbed all the product. The foundation initially has a strong cosmetic/alcohol smell, which dissipates but is still notable. I have sensitive skin and didn't have any reactions despite the fragrance.   In terms of color, the neutral is slightly ( very slight ) yellow leaning but find that typically unfortunately of deep dark foundation either too yellow or clay red.  On initial application it can be a little striking off but dries down a better color. On range, I believe there is only one neutral beyond this shade and no cools. I'm in my winter shade and no where as deep as I could be so unsure for other dark-skinned individuals how it fairs.   I found this to be more of a natural matte than a sort of radiance finish. Note: I have dry skin but used this in conjunction with a snail serum as my base. For me it was a solid medium coverage despite it serum and could be built up a little more. Gave a special occasion vibe.  I only lightly finished the base with Nars finishing power and NYX matte setting spray. It is quite transfer resistant and this was tested with my use of mask ( cause COVID is still real ) majority of the two tests. I was in a  hot packed party atmosphere, drink and the second day ate and all looked great! I noticed very mild creasing around the smile lines but once again I wear a mask which can create a humid environment.  Overall, I believe it products quality product with solid natural matte result and comfortable long wear. Try it!"

For a foundation with Hyaluronic Acid, it just doesn't feel very hydrating on the skin, but I could layer a hydrating primer under it and probably fix that issue a bit. The biggest issue I have with this product is how quickly it attaches to dry bits on my skin that I didn't even know were there, and it just got worse as I tried to massage it in with my hands. I may wait until warmer weather to bring this foundation back out when my skin may be a bit oilier naturally."

The application was very nice and the shade that I got was also nice even though I got one that was a little too dark for my winter skin. Itu2019s still blend it out really nice just fine.
