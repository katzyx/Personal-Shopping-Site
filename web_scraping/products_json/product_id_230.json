I put this all over my arms and chest, and my legs if I'm wearing a short skirt or shorts and it makes my whole body look so glowy. I get people commenting on it all the time. it makes my skin feel nice and hydrated too, and it doesn't catch on any dry patches I may have. it also makes me feel luxurious."
