Given that it was almost 50 dollars and from what I thought was a reputable brand, in store at Sephora, I figured it would be a win.    Perhaps it is billed as 'invisible oil' because no one can tell that I attempted to style my hair except for me, when I touch my hair and feel how greasy it is.    I have tried it with my flat iron, with my diffuser, and with air-drying.  I have tried to apply it to both damp hair and dry, sometimes both, and under no circumstances has this product worked for my hair type.  It is super slimy and just sits on top of my hair.  It's even rather difficult to wash off my hands.  The return window has actually closed now, and my hair has looked like garbage for two months because I keep trying to make this stuff work.  A lot of people seem to be really happy with this product, but I would say if you are wavy 2b like me, perhaps go for the trial size."

What I personally love though is how quickly this soaks into the hair and how glassy and soft it leaves it. The scent is pretty mild and I don't notice it for long, but the results with this oil are fantastic. It's not overly heavy either but it definitely works to make the hair look and feel it's best.

Either theyu2019re too lightweight and donu2019t smooth out the frizz, or theyu2019re too heavy and weigh my curls down. This product does neither and takes care of both problems.   The consistency is actually a cross between and oil and a serum, which is what makes it so unlike anything else Iu2019ve ever tried. It is perfect for smoothing out frizz and breaking the crunchy gel cast you get if you apply heaps of styling products like I do. I recommend this to anyone who compliments my hair. It is pricey, but worth every penny, as I have not found an alternative (drug store or high end) that compares."

I had heard good things about bumble and bumble so I splurged on the full size of this oil, and it is my absolute favourite oil ever. The full size bottle lasts me just under a year using it every time I wash my hair (2-3x per week) and whenever my hair feels dry I finger comb a pump or two through my dry hair to bring it back to life.   I didn't realize how well it was taming my fly aways/frizz and hydrating my hair until I stopped using it. I have long hair (lower back length), and it's super wavy (borderline curls but not quite) but not thick at all and this has never, ever, made my hair greasy.   My hair is pretty dry, but like any oil obviously don't apply close to your roots. I work in the majority on the bottoms of my hair, then if I have frizz up top I use the leftover oil on my hands to *lightly* smooth it down by running my fingers through it.  I've been buying it religiously for three years now and I have no plans on stopping. Price is a little much but considering how long it lasts me, it's a good investment."

I also use this product before I curl my hair to hold the curl much better (without the product my curls will fall within a few hours - this extends it for an all-day look).

If I need more moisture, Iu2019ll put a little in after styling with heat tools. This Bumble and Bumble oil is so light I didnu2019t think it would do anything at first. I used a very small amount on damp hair and used a tiny bit more once Iu2019d straightened. It feels great and smells great, but be careful not to overdo it or youu2019ll get oily easily. This is a great alternative to other popular brands, they deliver similar results but this lighter formula would be great for thin to thick hair."

            "review_text": "This is a good addition to my collection of hair oils.  I always put hair oils on my hair after flat ironing to take away the somewhat parched look I get (especially on the ends) from years of heat styling.  This hair oil stood up to my HG one, and I might even grow to love it just as much or better.  I got a VERY sleek look with this oil which is what I aim for.  I love poker straight hair with a great sheen.  My hair has grown less sleek from heat damage, but this hair oil reminded me of the good old days.  Plus, I thought my ends laid flatter instead of being a dried/frayed mess.  One does have to use caution with this oil, though.  I found that a lot comes out of the bottle.  Even when I was careful to control the amount, this oil is very oil-y/slick.  I was really afraid that I used too much, even though I am well versed in hair oils.  I ended up using the right amount, but I'm concerned that in the future I will over-do it.  Those with thin or fine hair should be extra careful.  I initially even felt like my hair was too coated by the oil/silicones.  I didn't necessarily mind the feel, but I was concerned about it getting greasy moving forward.  I'm just hoping that I don't wind up with residue.  Another thing that I wasn't pleased about was that this was very hard to wash off my hands.  My hands were very greasy after I used this, and I had to soap them up at least three times.  It's an annoyance, but it also made me wonder if I was distributing the oil throughout my hair - or just rubbing it all over my hands.  All turned out well in the end.    So, this product is a little quirky but I think overall it is worth it.  My hair is thick, so it can handle oils well.  However, is this isn't the case for you I would start by using a very small amount, and maybe even using in conjunction with your usual hair oil until you get used to this one.  Also worth noting: the price point is a little high."

It is also PERFECT for use on my daughters hair. she has very thin hair and the spray products are too much, this has just the perfect amount of shine without making it look greasy and dirty."

What a bummer. Especially since this product is $50! As someone who is on a natural hair journey I now read the labels and make sure I know whatu2019s going in my hair. Silicone makes the hair appear healthy and shinny but over time creates a barrier over your hair shaft and makes itu2019s harder for your hair to absorb moisturizer which ruins it. Just read labels ladies. Most of the products in this line contains silicone by the way."

Iu2019ve been using good conditioners and being careful not to break the hairs when theyu2019re wet (I blow-dry), but there was still nothing I could do to stop these tons of frizzy-fried hairs from popping up all over.  I got this as a sample and I wanted to try it because what it says it does is what I wanted (hair that can be made to appear sleek when it naturally wouldnu2019t tend to do that). Iu2019ve tried other oil-type products that didnu2019t work for me (even if I only used a little), so I was not expecting this to work for me. The cashier really warned me not to use too much. I barely used enough to get some oil on the tips of 2 fingers, then spread it around to the other fingers and ran it through just the ends of my hair. I thought Iu2019d need to grab more for the rest of my hair once or twice but nope. Just that first bit was enough for everything. I just kept combing it through further upwards by hand. I was surprised by how the oil made me be able to comb through my wet hair so easily without breaking the hairs. Even detangler hasnu2019t done nearly as well. Another thing I didnu2019t expect was that using this seemed to cut my drying time in half. I love that it protects the hair because the last thing Iu2019d want is to damage it more. After I was all done I did notice a lot fewer frizzy-fried hairs, at least 75 percent less than with other things Iu2019ve tried. The overall look was a lot more sleek or u201cdoneu201d than with anything else Iu2019ve tried. It was nice to not have to feel like a frizzy-fried mess for once after going through the trouble of doing all I could do. Doing my hair felt overall a lot easier too. Iu2019m definitely going to continue using this stuff and no longer need to be searching for a product that works for me."

Sometimes, if my hair is extra dry, I'll add it to my blowdry cream (kerstase discipline) before I style, then add more once it's fully dry.   I only wash twice a week, and it's great for touching up the ends every day. It's by far the LIGHTEST hair oil I have ever used. I have a lot of hair, but it's very fine, and this is one of the few hair oils I've tried that never weighs my hair down, even after multiple applications. I know it's pricey, but the quality and performance are worth it for me. Plus a large bottle lasts me about 6 months--100 bucks a year for silky, gorgeous hair (that, by all rights, should be looking like horse hay) is alright with me."

I've tried every hair oil out there and this one, by far, has shown the best results. Whether you're using a diffuser on your curls or letting them air dry, this product makes all the difference!

Everything else I've tried, including Moroccan oil just weighed my hair down and didn't make it any healthier.  I am absolutely in love with this oil.  I put this in my hair before blowdrying and not only did it make my hair gorgeously silky and smooth, but it cut my drying time in half! I usually have to flat iron my hair to tame it, but not with this product. Also, it smells divine, not overly heavy and perfumed. It's very lightweight also.  This is one of the best hair products i've ever tried - highly recommend!"

I think this makes a great overnight treatment to nourish your hair by using a few pumps right before bed. It really soaks in overnight and gives dry hair a moisture boost. Love the scent and texture of this product. It's not my FAVORITE hair oil but it definitely gets the job done and is worth trying if you're looking for a dry oil that's not too heavy/greasy. #contest"

After having an unfortunate experience with a very popular shampoo by a well known drugstore brand, my hair was dry, falling out, and beyond damaged. I had to cut 5 off.  That very evening I had my hair cut short, I decided that I would purchase this and start using an oil on my hair ends after every wash. I was going to take control of my damaged hair.  It's been 5 months since I bought this and it has not only restored my hair, but kept it in excellent condition. I have not even needed a trim since I started using this along with the Invisible Oil Primer.  If your hair is dry, damaged, colored, etc and you're at your wit's end, try this.  Do note that this should only be used on the mid-lengths to the end. Using it around your scalp can leave you feeling and looking oily.  I personally use less than a dime size amount of oil each application and I still almost have a full bottle. This is going to last me for ages."

Because my hair is naturally wavy, it enhances the waves and smooths my hair for a natural shine that does not look at all greasy. I think this is safe to use with thin hair. Just make sure to rub a pea size between your hands really good before applying to hair. Concentrate most to the ends of your hair, which show dryness the most.

Now I squirt 3-5 drops of oil into my palms and use my hands to lightly spread it over the hair on one side of my head, moving on to major scrunching from the ends to really work it in (repeat on other side).

The smell is quite subtle, and a little goes a long way ( I use only one pump of the bottle for hair that's about 4 inches past collarbone).

This means my hair is always super puffy, lots of fly aways. Italian girl hair also means if I try to just use a little coconut oil to calm it down my hair gets SUPER greasy and ratty looking FAST. Luckily I traded on VIB points for a deluxe Bumble and Bumble sample set that included this and my life hasn't been the same sense. Just a little squirt of this worked through my hair and I can't believe how irresistibly smooth and sleek it is. I'm honestly running my fingers through it right now in awe. I never knew my hair could look like this without a straightener. Will definitely invest in the big bottle!"

It makes my hair shiny, it smells good, and it has surprisingly really improved the health of my hair. I wasn't able to leave it to air dry before because it would get so frizzy, but now I just put on some of this oil when it's damp, scrunch a little to accentuate my natural wave and it air dried soooo beautifully. I've never used anything so versatile! Also great when you just want to blow your hair out. If you can only buy one thing for your hair, PLEASE do yourself a favour and let it be this!"
