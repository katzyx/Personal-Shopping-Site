A little goes a long way! I can usually make a 5oz bottle last around five months so that is comforting when I process the price tag.  Also, I have tried multiple dupes listed online and I have come back to this product! Nothing compares!!!"

I have fine frizzy hair, and I love how lightweight this oil is, it's hard finding products that don't weight my hair down. A little goes a long way to reduce frizz, but I haven't particularly noticed extra shine. It's so lightweight and it gets absorbed so well in my hair, I could literally drench my hair in it without getting greasy. For me it doesn't work as heat protectant, just as finisher to tame frizz and nourish my ends. If I could, I would only use fragrance free hair care... but for styling products is almost impossible. At least the Shu Uemura scent don't linger in my hair and is lightweight enough to not bother my nose when applying; it's a pleasant floral vanilla."

I also have super hard water and my hair does suffer from dryness.  I have tried so many hair oils and saw little to no difference.  This, I applied one night, and the next morning I couldn't believe it.  I tried to trace back even, had I used a new shampoo?  A new conditioner?  Hair mask?  Nope.  The only different thing I did was add this to my hair once I dried it before going to bed.  I continued to use it and it's been one month.  My hair has NEVER been healthier looking AND feeling, softer, shinier, manageable, but still has fullness when I style it, it's never weighed down, tacky, oily... just amazing, amazing hair I never thought I could ever have."

I was a little nervous to try the hair oil because this was not a product type (oil) that has worked for me in the past. I have a lot of hair, but it is on the finer side. Well, this product completely changed my view on hair oils! The first thing I noticed was the amazing smell--this could be a pro or con for some people, but I suspect it is less of an issue for people with sensitivity since it is going on the hair and not the skin. It smells like an expensive French skin care product. Nothing heavy and didnu2019t notice a lingering smell, just nice scent out of the bottle. I used it after washing my hair when it was damp but not wet. I made sure to really work the product in my hands first to warm it up. When I first started using I applied only the tiniest amount because oils can make my hair greasy BUT after a few times I was able to increase to the correct amount. Absolutely NO greasiness. Instead, the oil left my hair shiny and bouncy. Genuinely one of my favorite hair products."

I really felt that it protected my hair through wash days as well. I also loved the faint feminine scent. The price is insane to me though. Especially with the simple ingredients that it consists of and the plastic bottle its in. So I will say, if you have the money or want to treat yourself, get it. It does whats supposed and You only need a little bit so it will last you forever. But if you don't, there's cheaper products that can get you the same results."

I found the oil to be very absorbent and silky so a very little goes a long away. It didnu2019t leave my hands greasy but I found it did make my hair greasy. To prevent the greasy look I would revert to using rice sized amounts on only certain sections of my hair. It is comparable to other brands but better than some. I would compare it to a bio silk or a chi oil. The aroma was pleasent and the packaging is nice and simple. This bottle will probably last me a few years and I donu2019t see myself using it on a regular basis but I wouldnu2019t talk bad about the product either if that makes sense. Overall about a 7/8"

A lot of other oils I've tried leave my hair oily looking. This oil absorbs right into my hair, leaving it soft, and extremely shiny, and best of all, frizz free. It also is lightly fragranced and smells amazing. I have also used this on my teen, who has fine, very curly, very frizzy hair. This has been a game changer for her curls!

It also helps bring my wavy hair out which I absolutely love. i highly recommend the Shu Uemura Essence Nourshing Protective Oil."

After years of trying everyoneu2019s favorite hair products and finding that they were fine but not amazing, I had given up on truly achieving salon like results at home. Iu2019m good at blowing out my own hair so I took comfort in the fact that my hair would look a little better professionally blown out but that I did a pretty good job on my own. Wellu2026 move over, blow dry bars. This is it. I have thin, fine, curly hair that doesnu2019t really want to do much. Most oil products either donu2019t do a ton for my hair or result in an oil slick. This is the only one Iu2019ve ever found that gives me the results I want. A tiny drop goes a very long way, meaning no matter which size you buy, youu2019re good for a long time, and it delivers. I donu2019t have a ton of frizz when I blow dry in the first place but any that I do have, this takes care of, so if youu2019re just looking for frizz reduction then yeah, this will do it. But where this product really shines is the rest of the blowout: it adds just enough weight to my hair that it appears less fine, more substantial u2014 hair that I can toss around, hair that doesnu2019t just fly all over the place with the slightest wind gust. I have body and movement and weight and substance to my hair after a quick blowout, even with minimal effort on my part. The smell, which is just a bonus, is subtle but luxurious u2014 leaving me looking and feeling like Iu2019ve just left the salon, every time. Doesnu2019t weigh me down, and doesnu2019t leave my hair the least bit oily (and I only wash once a week). I will use this forever and ever."

Just a few drops of this magical elixir are enough to cover your hair from root to tip.

It even seems to play nice with my natural oils and doesn't feel greasy after a day or two. Is it nice? Yes. Is it worth the premium price tag? Maybe. I've used hair oils ranging in price from $14-$75 per bottle. The ingredients list for all of them are almost identical with the plant oil(s) being the biggest difference. My favorite is the bumble and bumble hairdresser's invisible oil, but this oil is a close second. I have long hair and I expect I'll go through the 5oz bottle in about a year.  Tbh the smaller size bottles aren't worth it because I have to use more of this product to get the same benefits. If you don't want to spring for the 5oz value size bottle just get yourself the b&b oil or the John Frieda frizz ease serum with similar ingredients and results."

I'm super-picky about hair oils because I have fine, blonde hair and most of the oils and hair serums that I've tried leave my hair feeling greasy or heavy but this actually makes my hair feel softer and lighter.  My expectations were low, honestly, because initially when dispensing it from the bottle it feels slightly thick but it somehow absorbs into my hair without weighing it down and it has an incredible scent!  It can be used on wet or dry hair but it works best for me to blow dry my hair until it's almost dry and then add the oil to my hair and finish blow-drying and using it that way makes my hair feel silky-smooth.   It's getting four stars from me because of the price because admittedly, it's expensive.  I'd advise getting a mini to try it out first before committing to the full-size but honestly, when I run out of this (and it'll take forever because the bottle is large and I don't need much per application), I would probably rebuy it despite the price tag.  I'm just happy to have found an oil that works well for me so it's worth the splurge."

However, I am thoroughly impressed by how well my tresses have taken to this lovely product. In comparison to many other hair olis and serums on the market that I've tried, a little bit of product goes a very long way. Additionally, the product is long lasting and has a lightweight formula which makes for better absorption. Typically, my hair is quite oily, but during the winter, it gets very dry. But, I found that when combined with other products, the oils were locked in a lot better especially when styling was involved. I would recommend this product to any friend or family member in the market for a hair oil that works well other products and wouldn't mind making another purchase onve the sample that I received finishes."

I would say this oil helped a bit, my hair looked shinier and it helped fix my hair after a windy day. However, it also felt like my scalp was a bit oiler than normal. Overall, I would say I was underwhelmed. Since this is the first oil I've used, I'm not sure if it's this product or just hair oils in general aren't that helpful with my hair type. I don't think I would purchase this myself in the future, especially for the price."

My hair is so very shiny and healthier. It is so much stronger than before i started using and i could not be more pleased. It also has made a drastic change with the frizzy and split ends.

I was in awe when I came to know that this oil was harvested from the Japanese island of Toshima, where each seed is handpicked and transformed into nourishing oil. I use this oil for various purposes and since I have started using it has left my hair soft, and healthy. It has also improved my hair's moisture level from mid-lengths to ends and tames my frizzy hair on daily basis.  There are different ways I use this oil. I use it as a conditioning treatment by massaging into scalp and applying all throughout my hair. For styling I use just one pump into my hands and work through my hair from mid-lengths to ends. I also use it as a hair mask by using three to four pumps into dry hair and leave it in for 15 minutes before shampooing my hair."

Another benefit? The Shine, I got so many compliments how shiny and healthy my hair looked. What's also really cool is that you can use it in three different ways. My favorite and easiest way was to use it to style my hair with one pump applied to my hair mid-length to the ends. You can also use it before shampooing by doing three to four pumps with a comb. Or lastly,  you can use it as a conditioning treatment for moisturizing hair. You just separate your hair into four sections, and then apply one pump to each section from mid-lengths to ends and then massage the product into your scalp. Leave the treatment on overnight and be prepared for luxurious, smooth and hydrated hair! Also, it smells DIVINE!"

I can't really vouch for it as a styling tool as I haven't been doing much lately but the oil leaves my hair much softer than most other products I've tried, even when air drying. The price is steep but three pumps is more than enough so the bottle will last. It doesn't really help with frizz, but I think of it as I do of my body lotion: A necessary step after a shower. The scent is strong so it's worth checking out in store, but like most shu uemura products it's an elegant fragrance. I was worried about oiliness as I only wash my hair twice a week at most; thankfully it really only makes the hair softer. I occasionally add a small amount to dry hair mid-cycle (mostly the ends) to add a little shine. If you do this, I recommend you stick with a small amount because it can add a ilttle oiliness. I will buy this again when my bottle finishes."

After using this, I didn't even have to pull out the flat iron, it was a smooth as if it hadn't even been blown dry, and although this product is very pricey, it is going to last you a long time. We are talking 6 months at least even if you use this everyday, as you really only need a little amount and a little amount will go a long way. Seriously though, hands down the best hair oil for thick and frizzy hair. I have attached a picture of how my hair looks right after the hair oil and right after blow-drying, no flat iron was needed!"

I tested it out 4 different ways:  Overnight treatment: saw the most difference only with shine  Before shampooing: didn't make much of a difference  After a shower while hair is wet: made my hair feel filmy but detangled Finishing oil: worked best after styling"

I don't just use it at night. that was getting expensive. I was kind of afraid of oils though because they make my hair generally lie flat and heavy. Even Kerastase. This doesn't. It is better for fine hair while still getting all the benefits. Now I can save the night leave in for night and use this during the day. I will repurchase but I don't think that will be for awhile because the amount you get is very generous. I am glad I bought this. It is kind of like that Tom Ford eyeliner.

It's easy to use and I like that it locks in place to avoid accidents. It dispense the perfect amount. A little goes a long way, and I'm impressed with what a good sized bottle this is; it should last for awhile. The first thing I noticed when using the oil was its scent. It smells very pleasant. It is light enough not to overwhelm my senses and smells a little sweet and fruity. I'm reminded of watermelons or a bouquet of flowers. It absorbs quickly on both wet or dry hair. No other oil I've tried is so lightweight yet still so moisturizing. I'm impressed that it can make my hair look great without weighing it down. My hair feels super soft and smooth, and it looks super shiny when it dries. If I use it on dry hair, then the results are instant. This makes it perfect for the times when I only have a few minutes to get ready. According to the bottle shu uemura's oil even protects against UV light. Is there anything it can't do. I love a multipurpose product, and I love shu uemura Essence Absolue Nourishing Protective Oil. I'd definitely recommend it."

To use as a styling aid, apply 1 pump and work through your hair mid-shaft to the ends. To use as a pretreatment before shampooing, apply 3-4 pumps and comb through your dry hair. To use as an overnight conditioning treatment, apply 1 pump each to 4 sections of hair from mid-lengths through ends, and massage into scalp. This contains camellia oil which really makes a difference. My hair was softer and shinier. It just improved the overall look and health of my hair. What surprised me is that it detangles your hair beautifully! The product is a bit on the pricier side but absolutely worth it! You need very little of this product in your hair so this bottle will last a really long time. I highly recommend this! Be very careful with the pump. My pump popped off and I was having to squeeze the product out instead of pumping. My daughter kept working with it until eventually she was able to reattach the pump.

I've noticed a dramatic increase in softness and smoothness, and much less frizz with the air dry, so I assume the results with heat drying/styling would be similar or better. I've been alternating between putting this on right after conditioner and, per the bottle's suggestion, putting this on BEFORE shampooing and letting it sit like a mask before washing and conditioning as normal. Both have shown similar results. I will say that this is a very thick oil, so I've found best results using one pump, combing through, and repeating for a total of two pumps.

My hair also attracts static like nothing I've ever seen before. It is color treated, so I have my fair share of breakage and, in the winter especially, it is DULL. I've tried so many products that leave my hair looking and feeling dirty, greasy and just messy overall. I was about to give up, but I tried Shu Uemura Essence Absolue Nourishing Protective Oil and I swear to you that this has magically transformed my hair!  This formula smells absolutely delicious! I don't think there is a scent added, rather just the wonderful smell of quality ingredients that make it fresh and heavenly. The pump bottle makes it very easy to dispense exactly the amount you need. A little goes quite a long way with this, so the bottle will last a while.  I'm quite pleased at how well it absorbs into the hair instead of sitting on it like other oils do. Because of this, there is no extra weight added. My hair doesn't look slick, greasy and it doesn't look like I pasted it to my scalp.  Blow outs are so easy now that I'm not working through tangles all the time, and my hair is barely tangling when it's dry! (I love this because I'm not breaking my hair when I brush!) I have noticed that my hair has a strength that it never had in the past and I'm not walking around looking like I stuck my finger in a light socket- the static is gone!  38 years into my life and I've finally found the perfect product for my hair. I'm loving how shiny, smooth, sleek and healthy it is! This product is literally magic!  I'll also note that I tried this on my daughter who has curly, tangly and frizzy hair. We couldn't have different hair types. Her curls look better than ever and she is no longer self conscious about her frizz ball hair.  I whole heartedly recommend this product to anyone who wants to breathe some life back into boring and dull hair!"

I like applying a small amount to damp hair prior to styling for the added protection benefits and then rubbing a tiny drop through my ends once dry to give it shine and piece-y-ness.

I have to be soooo careful what I use or my hair will look greasy and thinner.  This is just perfect.  I only need like half a pump and work it well into lower third of my hair.  My blowout is so much easier with less tangling and my hair is easier to brush through afterwards with no greasy stringiness.  It smells lovely, not overbearing and dissipates.  I will repurchase this over and over.  Yes, itu2019s a bit pricey but you need so little it lasts a looooong time.  If you have fine hair use sparingly."

After using them for a few weeks, in combination with the Essence Absolue Oil, Iu2019ve noticed that the shampoo and conditioner work better on their own as opposed to with the hair oil. The shampoo and conditioner worked well together. My hair was nice and soft, even when air dried. I wasnu2019t too big of a fan of the Essence Absolue Oil, though. I felt like it made my hair more straw-like and not as soft as it usually is. A big struggle with my hair is frizz, and my hair still looked like a giant fluff ball when using this product, so that was a bit of a disappointment, but it was nice to get to try these new products. I donu2019t know if Iu2019d purchase them in the future, but this could change if I see different results before I run out of the products."

I prefer a thicker oil because I have long curly hair and this is more like a finishing oil because it's lighter so I use it when my hair is dry just to tame frizz.

This oil manages my hair in both situations - it keeps my hair silky feeling, with no frizz and no static. It doesn't make my hair greasy, just soft and shiny. IDK what is in this product, but it's magic."

I read the reviews before use, especially the comments about replacing your conditioner with with this oil and gave it a shot.  OMG. I have waist-length and colour treated but healthy hair, that is very fine but thick. After shampooing, I used three pumps from roots to tips and combed through. My hair didn't feel softer immediately, but it combed through much quicker than usual. I then gave it a very quick rinse under cool water and wrapped up my hair in a hair turban. When I combed it through later, my hair was immediately more sleek, no catches with my comb, but when I began to blow-dry my hair, the magic showed. My hair was a shiny cloud around my head; it felt cleaner, lighter and more silky.  It had actual bounce! My husband kept laughing at me because I couldn't stop touching my hair all day. My new holy grail.  I then tried to buy more as soon as I got to my laptop, but it was already sold out. Hopefully it will be back in stock soon. Even at full price (which is crazy!) I'd buy it. Only three pumps per wash with all my hair, it's so worth it! NB: I've now used it four days and the magic continues."

I have medium-long bleach blonde hair that has unfortunately undergone quite a bit of damage due to heat styling and colouring. I've used this as part of my repair and grow system and have had wonderful results. My hair is much healthier! I also currently have REMY hair extensions in, and use this to moisturize the extensions, since they don't receive the natural oils from your scalp that your real hair gets. Does the job perfectly!"
