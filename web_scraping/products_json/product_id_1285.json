It did make my pores small and helped with any breakouts. The only downfall I found was it did not work well with foundation. Even with a moisturizing primer, and some heavier moisturizer this product still caused dry skin on my cheeks with foundation. Recommend using only in the PM with a heavier moisturizer. There are also plenty of other toners/treatments that help with acne and pore size that do not dry your skin out and can be used prior to foundation."

I was not prepared for this to make my entire face purge in red, painful breakouts that took weeks to heal. I even started out by gradually incorporating this by using it once to twice a week because I know that this formula is super concentrated. I continued to use this product for over a month in the hopes that the purging was normal and it would eventually go away, but it was a never-ending cycle of continuous painful, red breakouts and irritation. I only gave two stars because it gave my skin a good initial glow when first applied. I finally stopped using it and switched to an EWG verified skincare brand that has drastically helped repair the damage this product caused me. I went in with very high hopes expecting the purge, but please, please be careful trying this if you are prone to breakouts. (Attached below is my skin before and after using this product.)"

The standout feature of this exfoliant is its ability to slough off dead skin and excess sebum safely and without irritation. It's particularly impressive how it's helped me navigate the hormonal shifts of perimenopause, which have brought all kinds of fun changes to my skin. The salicylic acid works wonders for keeping pores clear and minimizing breakouts.  In winter, when my skin tends to be drier, I use it up to twice a day. During summer, I typically scale back to every other day, and it still maintains its effectiveness.  Hot tip: Apply it directly with fingers onto clean skin. This will help you use less product -- only about 4 drops per application -- and avoid adding cotton pads to the landfill."

My skin feels smoother and looks more refined, with a noticeable decrease in breakouts. It's also lightweight and absorbs quickly, making it easy to layer with the rest of my skincare routine.

I did experienced small breakouts which may, or may not be purging. nowhere on the bottle or literature does it say it's non-comedogenic.   Notables: 2% Beta Hydrody Acid aka salicylic acid,  green tea, methylprpanediol, butelyne glycol (which causes the oily feel) I will keep using this to see if I achieve tge results that made this a multi-award winning loved product (unclogs & shrinks enlarged pores,controls oil) *received product free from Paula's Choice for honest review"

I started using it, and I was surprised how gentle it was. For such a powerful product, I really thought I would experience some sting, redness and sensitivity, all worth it if it works, I thought. But there was none of that at all! It kept my pores squeaky clean, exfoliating gently without harsh physical scrubbing. It prevented huge cystic acne! My skin is in a better place now, but I am so thankful for Paulau2019s Choice and I recommend it to everyone thatu2019s suffering from acne!"

Improved Skin Texture: Regular use can lead to smoother skin texture and a more even complexion. It helps in reducing rough patches and signs of aging. 3. Ease of Use: The liquid formula is easy to apply and absorbs quickly. It doesnu2019t leave a residue or sticky feeling, making it a convenient addition to your skincare routine. 4. Non-Irritating: Despite being a chemical exfoliant, itu2019s generally well-tolerated by most users. Itu2019s gentle enough to use daily or a few times a week, depending on your skinu2019s needs.  Cons: 1. Acne Purging: Some users might experience a purge phase where existing breakouts come to the surface before improvement is seen.

Even though i apply it on a dry skin, it keeps my skin hydrated, I havenu2019t seen huge changes in fine lines yet, but the overall glow and evenness of my skin has improved."

Here are  benefits of this product:  1. **Active Ingredient**: The exfoliant contains salicylic acid which penetrates deep into the pores to help remove dead skin cells, excess oil, and debris.  2. **Exfoliation**: It helps to exfoliate the skin's surface, promoting cell turnover and revealing smoother, brighter skin underneath. This can be particularly beneficial for those with acne-prone or oily skin.  3. **Pore Cleansing**: The BHA in this formulation is oil-soluble, allowing it to effectively unclog pores and reduce the appearance of blackheads and whiteheads.  4. **Anti-Inflammatory Properties**: Salicylic acid also has anti-inflammatory properties, making it suitable for those with sensitive or acne-prone skin.  5. **Non-Irritating**: It is often praised for being gentle on the skin, suitable for daily use for many skin types, including combination and oily skin.  6. **Application**: The product is typically applied after cleansing and can be used in the morning or evening. It's important to follow up with sunscreen during the day, as exfoliation can increase sun sensitivity.  7. **Results**: Users often report improvements in skin texture, reduced breakouts, and a more even skin tone with regular use."

That being said, as per Dr Dray, there are many kinds of nose blackheads and actually mine are not the ones that BHA helps with.  Also, my skin isn't really acne prone. I use BHA every few weeks to kinda refresh it... and don't see much results lol. I do believe I need to use BHA once in a while, but is it better than the one from The Ordinary? Not sure. Feels better on the skin - that I can agree. So in short, first understand what is it that you're treating before spending $$. Magic it is not."

After each use my skin felt smooth and toned, and I also noticed my skin become brighter. This product helps me with the healing process of acne. Some of my acne scars/dark spots also faded leaving with less discolouration on my face. And most importantly, I experienced no irritation or redness!"

I haven't seen a dramatic change in deeper wrinkles, but my fine lines are less noticeable. The overall texture of my skin has improvedu2014it feels much smoother and more even, with fewer rough patches and bumps. Iu2019ve also noticed a nice boost in my skinu2019s brightness. It looks a lot more radiant and has a healthy glow now. The only downside is that it can be a bit drying, so I had to cut back on how often I use it. But despite that, itu2019s been great for improving my skinu2019s clarity and texture, and Iu2019ve seen real benefits in pore size and luminosity."

Hereu2019s a shorter version without headlines:  ---  I've always been on the lookout for the perfect skincare product to tackle my combination skin, blackheads, and occasional breakouts. After hearing rave reviews, I decided to try Paula's Choice Skin Perfecting 2% BHA Liquid Exfoliant, and it has been a game-changer.  The sleek, minimalist packaging caught my eye, and the liquid formula is lightweight and absorbs quickly without leaving any greasy residue. I started using it every other night, applying a small amount to a cotton pad and swiping it over my clean, dry face. Thereu2019s a slight tingling sensation initially, but it quickly subsides.  After just a few weeks, I noticed significant improvements: fewer blackheads, smaller pores, smoother texture, and a more even complexion. My occasional breakouts were less frequent and healed faster. Now, after a few months, my skin has never looked better. I receive compliments on my clear, glowing skin regularly.  Paula's Choice Skin Perfecting 2% BHA Liquid Exfoliant is a must-have for anyone struggling with blackheads or uneven skin texture. Itu2019s gentle enough for regular use yet highly effective. If youu2019re hesitant about chemical exfoliants, give this one a try. Itu2019s truly a skincare hero in a bottle!"

I have mild rosacea in my cheek area, and I love that these products don't irritate my skin at all.  Pros: Gentle Exfoliation: Mandelic acid is less irritating, ideal for sensitive skin. Improved Texture: Regular use has left my skin noticeably smoother and brighter. Hydrating: Lactic acid helps retain moisture, preventing dryness.  Cons: Mild Tingling: Some users may experience slight tingling upon application. Sun Sensitivity: As with all AHAs, sunscreen is a must during the day.  Overall, this liquid exfoliant is perfect for those looking to refine their skin effectively without any irritation."

Using natural lighting, I took before and after pictures over a one-use period. The transformation was remarkable. My skin's clarity improved significantly, with a noticeable reduction in discoloration. Pores appeared less prominent, and my overall complexion became more even and radiant. One of the standout benefits was the enhancement in my skin's luminosity and tone. The combination of Salicylic Acid, Mandelic Acid, and Lactic Acid worked to deliver a glow. My skin not only looked brighter but also felt incredibly smooth and soft. Incorporating both products into my skincare routine was seamless. I started as recommended, using the AHA every 2u20133 days and the BHA on alternate days. Eventually, I progressed to using them daily, with BHA in the morning and AHA at night. This method ensured gentle yet effective exfoliation without irritation. I have recently cut down to one use per week. The overall health of my skin improved noticeably. It felt more resilient and balanced. The products are free from parabens, formaldehydes, phthalates, and other harmful ingredients, making them suitable for all skin types, including sensitive skin like mine. Additionally, the gluten-free and cruelty-free formulations are a bonus for those with specific lifestyle preferences. The Paula's Choice CA Exfoliation Experience Kit is a game-changer for anyone looking to improve their skin's clarity, luminosity, and overall health. Its gentle yet effective formulation makes it a must-try, and I highly recommend it. This kit delivers on its promise of multi-level glow and is a worthy addition to any skincare regimen."

For my skin, which is very sensitive, I found starting out with application every other day to be a little much. If you also have very sensitive skin you may want to start with 2-3 times a week at first to see how your skin reacts. After just one and half weeks the inflammation in my skin improved and the redness has started to calm and dissipate. The dryness in my skin has flaked off leaving a smoother, brighter tone.

I have sensitive skin, slightly oily T zone with dehydration and occasional dryness surrounding it and am prone to PD flares and I donu2019t find this aggravates of beings in flares. When they do come I back off of using this around my face until they clear up, but then can bring this back into the area pretty quickly. My skin looks like glass after using it and feels baby soft. Iu2019ve introduced several other actives to my routine and have fallen out of using them but this is my tried and true forever product. Super hydrating, a little goes a long way, and I work long hours in a barn with horses and this is the goat that keeps my pores clear and unclogged!"

After using it for a few weeks, my skin definitely feels smoother and my pores appear smaller. Plus, it doesn't feel drying or irritating at all.  Now, I have oily skin that can handle a bit more punch, but if you have sensitive skin, you might want to ease into using this product. It can be a little strong at first.

As someone with melanated skin, Iu2019ve always been cautious about introducing new products into my skincare routine, but this exfoliant has truly exceeded my expectations.  From the first application, I noticed a remarkable difference in my skin's texture and clarity. The 2% salicylic acid works wonders in gently exfoliating without causing irritation, which is crucial for my sensitive, pigment-rich skin. Over time, it has significantly reduced the appearance of my hyperpigmentation and post-inflammatory dark spots, giving my complexion a more even tone and radiant glow.  One of the standout benefits of this product is its ability to minimize the appearance of pores and control excess oil without stripping my skin of its natural moisture. Itu2019s lightweight and absorbs quickly, making it a perfect addition to both my morning and nighttime skincare routines. I also appreciate that itu2019s fragrance-free, which minimizes the risk of any adverse reactions.  Overall, Paula's Choice Skin Perfecting 2% BHA Liquid Exfoliant has become an indispensable part of my skincare arsenal. Itu2019s a game-changer for anyone with melanated skin looking to achieve smoother, clearer, and more even-toned skin. I highly recommend it! I uploaded then vs now photos"

Six months ago, I came across Paula's Choice BHA Liquid Exfoliant and decided to give it a try. Little did I know that this product would change my skin's appearance in way I never thought was possible.   Within a week of incorporating it into my skincare routine, I noticed a considerable difference. The stubborn pigmentation around my eyes started to fade, and my overall complexion looked brighter and healthier. My pores appeared visibly smaller, especially around my nose area, and my skin texture felt smoother.   Now, after half a year of using this amazing product, I can confidently say that my skin has transformed. I've been using it as directed, around 3-4 times a week. If you're struggling with similar skin concerns or just looking for an excellent, effective exfoliant, I can't recommend Paula's Choice BHA Liquid Exfoliant enough. I only wish I had found it sooner! 10/10 RECOMMEND   Photo with no foundation attached u2665ufe0f"

I was pleasantly surprised by how gentle this product is! I didn't encounter any stinging or burning or dryness, so I have now been using it every night before bed, followed by a hydrating serum. This has almost cleared my skin in just one week. My active break outs have almost completely subsided, my skin is visibly smoother and less red. Usually I deal with stubborn redness after a break out, but my complexion looks so even already! Also, my skin feels less oily after a long day. I'm going to keep using this and hope I continue to see these results but so far so GREAT!! I'm giving it 4 rather than 5 stars because I will say, I don't LOVE the smell of it. It's a bit funky. But it's worth it for how well it's working so far. I would definitely recommend this."

My skin isnu2019t sensitive and never breaks out like this when trying a new product. I canu2019t imagine if I was acne-prone how much worse my skin would have reacted.

This might work for other people but not for me, disappointed and will be returning."

I tried this product for several weeks without seeing a difference in my skin. Maybe it works for some people, but for a teen with comedonal acne, normal/dry skin type, and high expectations, it just disappointed me. My advice: you can give it a try (the mini is $13, it's not a splurge) if you want to, but keep in mind that it may not work for you. After all everyone's skin is different, and one product can't satisfy the needs of everyone."

I finally got clear skin! You only need a few drops at a time, so a bottle lasts for months - it's a great value. When I first started using it daily I had some very slight dryness, but nothing serious. Just moisturize well and use it every other day. My skin adjusted and now I use it every day with zero issues. The product itself also feels moisturizing, unlike other brands of drying alcohol-based toners. I did not have any irritation. I don't have particularly sensitive skin but my sister does and she uses this too with no problems. It has a faint medicinal scent but once it's on I don't even notice. Overall, I can't recommend this highly enough to help keep your pores clear and your skin feeling fresh!"

When I get out of my routine and eventually get back into it, following those steps above will typically have me seeing some sort of peeling of my skin. Nothing excessive or anything that a good cream cannot fix during the day. But that is also why it is so important for me to stick to the routine, and also why I am grateful this exfoliant comes in travel sizes.  This product really helps clear my acne when I have a breakout and I have noticed a reduction in recovery time, as well as redness.   I did feel as though my pores and the lovely gunk in them seemed to be on display when I first started using this. But that quickly when away with consistent use."
