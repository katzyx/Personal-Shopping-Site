This shampoo was so easy to use. I simply put it in the palms of my hands and rubbed it onto my scalp and hair. It had just the right amount of lather. It also smells so good! I love a shampoo that makes my hair smell delicious. It rinsed out very clean and didnu2019t leave any residue behind. I could tell that my hair was much smoother even when I was still in the shower. I had no tangles as I ran my fingers through my hair.  I really saw the magic after I blow dried my hair. It was so smooth. It also felt so much lighter. It felt very clean and revitalized. I didnu2019t even have to use as many styling product as usual. I was left with beautiful hair!"

My curls/ waves are bouncy looking with less frizz. Itu2019s still soft and manageable still easy to style."

            "review_text": "I have never written a review before on a product I got from Sephora but I just had to come give my experience thus far using this shampoo! I used to have really long, super thick hair. I live in a small town in South Carolina and our home runs on a well water system. When we first moved in about a year ago, I never realized the damage well water would do to my hair! My tub would be stained orange after a week when I washed it. My hair would be sticky and greasy within a day of washing it and I didnu2019t figure out the culprit was the heavy metals in the water until the damage was already done to my hair. So for a few months, I started boiling pots of distilled water and using clarifying shampoos that seemed to help a little but my ends were still so dry and my hair still lacked the luster and shine I had before. So then I purchased an Aquabliss shower filter off of Amazon which seemed to help a little but I still felt like my hair was being affected by the heavy metal- I.e the shower head filter wasnu2019t filtering as much as Iu2019d hoped. I spent WEEKS trying to decide which shampoo to buy that would be a good chelating product to break up the heavy metal in my hair. Iu2019m so skeptical of reviews on products because you just never know if theyu2019re paid reviews, or if the product just didnu2019t work specifically for that persons individual circumstances.  I finally pulled the trigger and bought this stuff along with the morrocanoil intense hydrating mask and OMG!!!! Iu2019ve used it TWICE, once a week, since receiving it in the mail two weeks ago and my hair is so shiny and slick and soft! Thereu2019s no built up residue leftover after washing and straightening and styling my hair afterwards was so much easier because my hair wouldnu2019t kink and tangle while applying heat to it. I have wavy/curly, dirty golden blonde, almost virgin (my ends have some faded color left from coloring my hair a few years ago) hair that goes down past the middle of my back with some weird layers due to some bre"

This shampoo gives me silky smooth soft hair that hardly tangles. One thing I donu2019t love is my scalp can lo oily the next day but some dry shampoo solves that."

Since that wasn't an option, I decided to try this and the mask instead--holy hell my hair has never been healthier. I saw my hairdresser again in December and she didn't have to cut off nearly as much. She told me that since she found out about this product, she recommends it to all her clients with hard water. I don't even color my hair and this product made a huge difference. If you are dealing with dry hair from hard water, buy it. The only drawback is that it is heavily scented, but smells just like any professional shampoo you'd get with a service at a fancy salon. Trust me, this set is so worth it."

The shampoo claims to remove up to 93% of metal particles from the hair, which can cause damage, dullness, and color fading. I have been using this shampoo for a few weeks now, and I must say that I am impressed with the results. The first thing that I noticed was the refreshing scent of the shampoo, which is not too strong or overpowering, but rather pleasant and invigorating. The shampoo has a creamy texture and a pearly color, and it lathers well on wet hair. A little of the product goes a long way, so you don't need to use too much of it. The shampoo rinses off easily, leaving the hair feeling clean and fresh. I noticed an immediate difference in the feel of my hair after using the shampoo. My hair felt softer, smoother, and more manageable. It also looked shinier and healthier, and my natural color was more vibrant. Overall, I liked the L'Oreal Metal Detox Shampoo and the whole range. I think it is a great product for anyone who wants to improve the health and appearance of their hair, especially if they have colored or damaged hair. I would recommend it to anyone who is looking for a gentle yet effective shampoo that can cleanse, nourish, and beautify their hair."

The lather was pretty rich and luxurious, making the washing experience enjoyable. I appreciated that a little went a long way. Although  I enjoyed the shampoo, I did fell like my hair was  a little dry after using.

Hair care is a process that takes time and understanding. You must create a regimen with a selection of products to aid in your current hair state.

Everyoneu2019s hair is different, and results will vary based on their hair texture and their overall health.  I was excited to try the Lu2019OREAL Professional Metal Detox shampoo. This collection is amid to remove metal buildup on the hair strands that can be caused overtime when you cleanse your hair. Many places have hard water or water that contains high levels of minerals. Overtime this can dry your hair, cause your color to fab and even cause other hair issues.  I used the whole metal detox collection on my mother who has color treated hair and was showing some signs of fading. I did two lathers of the Metal Detox shampoo which clarified her hair very well and removed all her product buildup. Her hair did feel dry after using the shampoo which is normal when using a clarifying shampoo. Her color did appear from vibrant which was my main concern with her medium brown hair color. The scent of the product to me was a light citrus scent that did not linger on the hair very long. This product would be good to use 1-2 times a month max. This is a clarifying product and shouldnu2019t be used on a regular basis for textured hair. Itu2019s also great for people dealing with product buildup and color their hair often."

I know this is color safe but in my experience that has happened every time Iu2019ve used this shampoo. I really like how clean and refreshed my hair feels. It doesnu2019t feel dry whatsoever. Comparing to my other shampoos (even brands from drugstore to expensive), this one takes the cake for me. Love how my hair feels. I know the bottle is a little on the smaller side but I will absolutely be repurchasing once I finish this. This is great for all types, I have curly hair and it didnu2019t mess up my curly.

Lu2019Oreal is obviously a trusted brand and this is a pro product. I like the scent of this shampoo and also the fact that it is sulfate free. I focus on that in my hair care products because of the money spent on my hair color. This product was gentle on my hair but I would say if you have any skin sensitivity to be careful because there is salicylic acid in the product and it is heavy on fragrance. I like this as a treatment and my hair looked brighter."

After washing with the shampoo my client's hair felt stripped and dry. My client stated, My hair normally feels softer after I shampoo it.   But I did reassure her that this Detox shampoo is actually taking out most of the metal in their hair.  I did notice the color was crisper after using this product. The hair was no longer brassy.  I would recommend this for use in salons as well as at home. Great results!"

I started sharing the word detox as it relates to our hair care a few years ago.  I can say with certainty toss your clarifiers and deep cleanser right now! Detox shampoo is the new squeaky clean. Why would my hair have metal in it you ask? The pipes that deliver the water to us. This is a problem extra especially for blonde women trying to grow their hair longer or for women who color their hair often.   Short haired blondes that cut it a lot may not need to invest in the full line but I would say that the shampoo can get the metals out and then the conditioner will protect the hair fromxmore metals going in. As we shampoo our hair there is a change in the PH of the hair and this shampoo does as it promises with a super gentle cleaning power and a low PH that makes it easier deranglw. The conditioner is thick amazing velvety to the touch and the shampoo being that the ingredients are super clean has a very low to no fragrance experience that goes with it! The other brands of detox products I tried took multiple uses but I noticed a difference within the first wash for this one. My hair is blonde and brittle and I noticed upon first use the texture was smoother to the touch. Blow dryed faster and cooperated more throughout the day. I used the whole line together the oil is also amazing. All three products smell almost like nothing just clean airy freshness. I will continue using for the future on all my clients in the salon bc it makes my job easier doing my hair at home and in the salon too!"

I donu2019t use a filtered shower head and recently learned how harsh the water could be to your hair, affecting your scalp health and color treatments, so the fact that this is a color safe sulfate free shampoo , it feels like an all in one superhero shampoo!

I really like the consistency of this shampoo,  it's like a gel cream which helps to keep it from running down my hands when pouring and creates a rich lather in the hands and on my actual hair too as it cleanses it. It didn't leave my hair feeling stripped but yet very cleansed. Only con for me Is the scent, very masculine."

Recently, I was fortunate to try the new Metal Detox products by L'Oreal Professional, and I must say, they exceeded my expectations. Today, I would love to share my experience with the Metal Detox shampoo.  Let me tell you, this shampoo is divine. The creamy formula is incredibly concentrated, allowing for a luxurious lather that leaves your hair feeling refreshed and revitalized. And the light citrus scent? Absolutely delightful.  After just one wash with the Metal Detox shampoo, my hair felt clean, detangled, and surprisingly moisturized. But what truly sets this product apart is its innovative use of Glicoamine - a patented ingredient designed specifically to remove metals from the hair fiber.  Water contains metals that can wreak havoc on our locks - causing damage, frizz, and even affecting hair color. By incorporating Metal Detox into your routine before and after coloring services, you can maximize the vibrancy of your hair color while minimizing breakage.  I personally struggle with extremely hard water in my area, but since using Metal Detox regularly, I have noticed a significant improvement in the overall condition of my hair. Not only that; even my scalp feels less dry!  This product has truly become an essential part of my daily hair care regimen that I will continue to use forever."

That being said, this detox shampoo is fantastic.     Upon opening, you will notice it has a musky aroma that is very strong. After a few uses, I adjusted to how strong it is, and now i love the scent of my hair.      Next, you will notice you really only need a dime size amount for medium length hair. This product  lathers extremely well. Now, most shampoos that claim to be a detox leave your hair stripped and feeling like straw. This does not leave the hair feeling that way at all! I highly recommend this product for anyone living with hard water."

As a licensed cosmetologist, Iu2019ve used the salon version of these products many times over the last 3 years.  Metal Detox was created specifically to detoxify and neutralize the metals trapped inside the hair fibers. Metals can get trapped in oneu2019s hair from at home hair-color,  and metals in the water from pipes or water plants. We professionals prefer to strip metals in hair in the hopes of protecting hair from drying out.  For some, the removal of metals brightens highlights, soften hair strands and improves the over all elasticity.  As a consumer, I felt as though the aroma was mild. One of the things I love about the salon version is the stronger scent. Musky Lemongrass and Citrus mix isnu2019t for everyone, but I love it.   This sulfate free shampoo has a 12 month air to openness date. Depending on your shampoo schedule, Iu2019d recommend using this product once a week to every two weeks. Its container holds 300 milliliters/  10.1 fluid ounces. It comes in an easy to squeeze bottle.    Depending on your hairu2019s density and length a little bit of shampoo can go a long way. As someone with curly hair, I find it better to apply the shampoo to dry hair then add water. It creates a better lather.   My only concern is the Pearlized color, it is used too often for the attraction of consumer products. I actually wish all clarifying shampoo were required to be clear."

I use the line in conjunction with the rest of the recommended products, the masque and hair oil.  The shampoo only requires a little amount. It actually expands in your hands and on the hair. I did a really good shampoo, taking my time to cleanse the scalp and hair. This detox actually removes buildup on the hair from minerals found in water, so take the time to rub it through the hair.  It smells great and leaves hair feeling hydrated and not stripped. I recommend following with like Products for the full effect.  I also recommend using only once a week if youu2019re washing your hair 3x a week. For those that wash maybe every 4-5 days, cleanse with a normal shampoo to cleanse scalp and then cleanse with this detox (so double cleanse only using the detox once).

One of the standout features of this shampoo was its delightful scent. It had a refreshing aroma that lingered in my hair, which was a pleasant bonus. Additionally, after the first use, I noticed that my hair felt incredibly soft and nourished. This initial result had me hopeful for a long-term positive experience.  However, as I continued to use the shampoo over time, I noticed that my hair gradually became almost unmanageable. It seemed to lose its natural shine and became difficult to style. This was quite disappointing, as I had expected the shampoo to consistently provide the softness and manageability it initially delivered.  While I understand that different hair types may react differently to products, Iu2019m not sold on Lu2019Oreal Professional Metal Detox Sulphate Free Shampoo based on my personal experience. While the initial softness and pleasant scent were commendable, the long-term effects on my hair were not as desirable."

Of all the products in the line, this is the one you absolutely need to detox your hair from harmful metal particles that dull and weaken hair.  This super rich and lathery shampoo really clings to each strand as it removes these impurities. Using this shampoo was very unique and unlike any other shampoos I have tried out before . It really creates a very dense layer of lather that feels lush and thick. It kind of reminds me of an oil cleanser for your face in the way it clings to dirt and debris all while replenishing what its purifying. This citrus scented shampoo really cleans hair without stripping it or making it dry and dull. This is the cleanest my hair has felt in years (this is saying a lot since I have tested lots of scalp and hair care products over the years). I definitely recommend giving this one a try if you struggle with full frizzy hair.   -Miranda Rice, Master Esthetician 10+ years (40 years old, combination skin, loves products that offer an experience)"

This product works on removing metal buildup caused by hard water scaling from your shower. The hard water really does a number on your hair removing all nutrients and drying out your hair and skin. I suffer from hard water issues from my shower, and I have to add so much product to soften it back up. The Metal Detox shampoo helps protect your hair and provides sheen and repair to your hair. The shampoo lathers up immediately on the first wash. Having thick hair, I really appreciate this! The shampoo is sulfate-free and prevents breakage for those who have color on their hair. It actually helped to keep my grey hair ruly. Most shampoos take two washes before you get a good lather to cover my entire head, Metal Detox did it in one wash. I had suds galore on the first wash and I love the Citrus scent. The smell is very soothing and refreshing. I had an idea that this product would be amazing, and it did not disappoint. When experiencing the product, I felt my hair's curls formed easier and had a sheen to them when it dried. The shampoo moisturized and hydrated my split ends better than expected. Can I say that this product just elevated to being one of my favorite products?"

Hard water has always been an issue so I had to try Loreal's Metal Detox Sulfate Shampoo with Glicoamine & Ionene. The first time I washed my hair without the shower filter and the second time with the shower filter.  First impressions, the scent has a soft citrus scent and was a creamy consistency. At 10 ounces it's a little smaller than my usual 12 ounce bottles of shampoo. However, you really only need a very small amount. The first time using the shampoo I double cleansed and followed it with the Metal Detox Professional Mask.I also followed it with the Metal Detox Professional Concentrated Oul. I was very impressed with how full and lightweight my hair felt after this deep cleanse. It was a breeze to detangle and I noticed even less breakage. after drying my hair had a noticeable shine and felt nourished.  The second time I used the shampoo it was with the shower filter I used less of the shampoo and used it as a first cleanse only and followed it with my regular shampoo. Following it with the same steps as my first try. Both ways worked well and I am thrilled that there is a product specifically for combating hard water mineral buildup for a deeper cleanse."

I would probably use a quarter size of the shampoo and it foams up beautifully. Lots of bubbles! I can say I am not a fan of the scent. It is a little strong but it fades.

After shampooing and rinsing my hair did not feel tangled and raw as some clarifying products have in the past.  I used Metal Detox every third shampoo followed by the Metal Detox Mask and Metal Detox Strengthening Hair Oil for maximum benefit.  Iu2019d highly recommend this shampoo for everyone who needs to remove harmful metal particles from their hair without compromising their color or perhaps straightening service.  The price point is $35, and a bargain because it is concentrated and everyone can perform this detoxing service at home instead of paying for an additional service at the Salon."

This line is recommended as a great primer before hair coloring and salon treatments and can be used as an everyday shampoo for most hair types. I color my hair but could see the advantage of this clarifying formula to remove metal deposits for any type of hair (including natural without chemical procedures). Although the formula is sulfate free it delivered an abundance of lather without the hair feeling stripped or parched.

I live in a very dry climate and I am in need of a shampoo that will not only remove particles built up in my hair but leave my hair feeling soft and hydrated.  So I couldnu2019t believe it but after using this shampoo just once, I could see and feel a visible difference.  My hair was noticeably less frizzy and tangled. I can see that with consistent usage, I will have improvement in the condition and texture of my hair.  I am sold!  This is a winner!"

This is one of those rare products where I could feel an immediate difference in my hair while still in the shower, and simply rinsing the product out. My hair felt immediately softer,  even though it was still wet. For that reason this is getting a high rating. I live in a home thatu2019s over 30 years old, and donu2019t have a shower head filter, and this product is meant to help people like me with hard water build up. I feel like it worked because my hair felt softer immediately. Sure enough, I used the matching hair mask and leave in serum from the same line, and my hair felt way softer once it was dry. I was really impressed.   The only thing I disliked about this product line is the fragrance. I couldnu2019t quite pinpoint what it was meant to smell like, other than perfume. It sort of smells like a perfume aisle if Iu2019m being honest, like a mix of various scents and I couldnu2019t quite place what the top notes were meant to be other than vaguely floral. It was super strong smelling, which is why Iu2019m removing on star. Thatu2019s simply personal preference. I hope that this line will be offered with other scents down the line because I was incredibly happy with the results."

Firstly, it removes brassiness from my blonde hair, secondly it hydrates so well without being overly oily or heavy. It leaves my hair full of supple volume and shiny! Iu2019m seriously in love. I have thick, wavy, bleached hair so the struggle for products that leave my hair feeling undamaged has been real. A little goes a long way, itu2019s rich feeling texture glides through your hair easily which Iu2019m impressed with. Iu2019m not a huge fan of the smell, which isnu2019t unpleasant. It smells more like a professional product that does a job than a pretty scented basic hair wash. All in all Iu2019m blown away by every aspect of this shampoo."

I was completely wrong. This shampoo seriously made my hair feel so soft and light, I couldn't believe it. I tend to get oily really fast and without a proper shampoo, it can weigh my hair down a lot. It did a fantastic job getting rid of hair oils and other metals that I didn't even know were in my hair without being harsh.

I washed my hair w/ the Lu2019Oreal Metal Detox Shampoo & then used the Metal Detox Mask conditioner. I then used the Metal Detox Oil & I let it air dry. I have never had such drastic results!! This combo didnu2019t weigh my hair down at all. It left it so moisturized and soft that I could actually run my fingers through it!! I can NEVER do that!! After using the shampoo I could immediately tell how clean my hair felt and not dry at all. Sometimes moisturizing shampoo can make your hair feel weighed down but with this one I was amazed at how light and airy it felt!! Okay, in the pic my hair looks frizzy, but I just let it air dry. I had hardly any curls & it made it so unbelievably easy to straighten!! Plus it was so soft!  Added bonus: my hair is so shiny!! I definitely recommend this Metal Detox Shampoo!!!!"

My hair used to be shiny but over the years of coloring and constant heat damage had made it frizzy and dull looking.  But this shampoo is bringing back the shine and bounce. The shine is definitely long lasting and it persists till the time I have the second wash of the week. Love the part that it keeps my scalp clean in between washes and it definitely feels like a deep clean.   The shampoo has a creamy consistency and has a great lather, it deep cleans my hair.

I will start by saying, for over a year prior to this product I have been using water soluble curly girl approved products so my hair is healthy and shouldnu2019t be too weighed down.  I wanted to give a true review, so I used this about once a week for 4 weeks.  I only wash my hair once a week because it is thick and I let it curl naturally (with product and no heat).  I first used this (the metal detox sulfate free shampoo), then the metal detox mask in the shower.  I went ahead and used my water soluble styling products so I could tell the difference between this shampoo and conditioner and my usual.  First off I will say that the directions on the bottles are small and hard to find.   The product smells good.  It has a light citrus scent.  It lathered well in my hair and washed out nicely.  After 4 or so weeks Iu2019ve noticed my hair is getting greasy before my once a week washing which is not typical with my other products and my scalp is becoming dry and itchy, which is also causing dandruff.  Because of the greasiness (day 4) and the dry, itchy, and flaky scalp, I donu2019t recommend this for anyone who has dandruff or dry scalp issues.  I will say my hair styled normally with this shampoo and conditioner and looked similar to how it looks with my older, higher priced shampoo and conditioner."

I'm usually a 2 day wash girl but can go 5 after this shampoo! As a busy mom, that is the highest of praise. I also find this isn't drying on my hair like some clarifying shampoos.

I used this shampoo twice over the course of a couple weeks and noticed consistent wiry/oily results.

This shampoo feels silky and it lathers up very well.   This shampoo is made to protect hair color, as well as making hair healthy.  I will say after using this shampoo my hair color looks vibrant.  I can see more if the reddish tint in my hair, that is combined in with my blondish brown hair.  My hair looks full of life, which is different than when I use some of the cheaper brands of shampoo.  I like that my hair looks full of shine and color.  I can't wait to continue to use this shampoo to see how my hair improves.  The only reason I'm giving this 4 stars is due to the scent.  The description claims this shampoo has notes of citrus, as well as having a little musky scent.  I feel the musky scent must overpower the citrus scent, because I did not smell any scent of citrus"

I also really like that the shampoo is free of sulphates and shampoo bottle itself is made of 95% recycled material.  I do have dry, fine light blonde highlighted and coloured hair and what matters to me most when Iu2019m looking for a new shampoo is how my hair feels after washing and drying and how it goes after a few days without washing. This shampoo passed the test. My hair felt soft and clean and looked shiny and healthy and didnu2019t feel oily at all. The shampoo can help with stopping breakage so I will continue to use it and hope to see continued improvement.

With all that being said, I was really looking forward to trying this product. The shampoo does a good job cleaning the hair and scalp and my hair feels lighter and soft as a result.

I did use 1 pump of Anti-Metal High Protection cream on the tips. Did not blow out and hair still felt silk and smooth. I have been struggling with tanglins on the inside, that is why I started wearing my hair in the ponytail . So far I am very happy with the results.

Metal Detox, well, that is rather new to me but there must be something true about it because my coloured hair looks shinier and glossier than usual. The colour seems to be more vibrant too. What I like about this shampoo is its lush formula that lathers extremely well. Also, the scalp feels clean so the shampoo has rather good cleansing properties. It smells expensive, exactly like it should. What I do not like about it though is the packaging. While I appreciate a simple design on the sticker, I am not a fan of a bottle. Since the formula is rather thick, it is hard to squeeze the shampoo out of the bottle, especially when your hands are wet. All in all, the shampoo dies work and is pleasant to use."

With regular use, I've noticed a reduction in brassiness and a healthier overall look. Highly recommend! ud83dudc81u200du2640ufe0fud83cudf1f"

It can be difficult to find clarifying and hydrating shampoos for natural blondes that do not change our hair color or leave it in worse shape than before we started.  This shampoo is a game-changer.  It has a light smell, lathers well, and rinses out quickly to leave the hair feeling clean and strong.  I used the mask, protectant, and oil from the same product line and was amazed with how strong and soft my hair felt for the 2 days between washes.  I didnu2019t even have to re-straighten it the second day and there were fewer tangles overall.  I definitely recommend this product line!"

Iu2019ve used this before as Iu2019ve previously received this shampoo and the mask from Influenster. I used the product for my fine hair, and while it worked well, I donu2019t feel it worked as well as my favorite shampoo.  It does have better packaging and price points than my go to shampoo. This shampoo does well but I expect it for it to make my hair much radiant. Iu2019ve learned that this shampoo combined with their other products on the metal detox line works really well (better than on its own). It is why I changed my rating to five stars. When I use the four products on the detox line,my hair looks amazing. It made my hair look shiny and very healthy. My hair feels so soft and manageable. I am going to continue to use all the product sent and I may repurchase once Iu2019ve used it all up. I recommend trying out this entire line."
