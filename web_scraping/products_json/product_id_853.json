Key  notes of jasmine, musk, sandalwood, and cedarwood. Blended into a unique fragrance that burst of aroma that all you need is 2-3 sprays. This fragrance is long, lasting up to 4-8 hours. Yes, what a great duration.   Kayali is one of my favorite brands for perfumes. They have their unique glass bottles with KAYALI  brand logo that has a crystal clear top that looks like a crown to me which pops out as an elegant look with the feeling of a luxurious fragrance that has amazing blends, as for me great for this season. Even though I can use this perfume every day,  that's how amazing this perfume is.  I have gotten many compliments already. I'm picky of certain smells of perfumes, as for this one, it's on my favorite list.   Looking for a long-lasting fragrance that is not overpowering or strong. This is the perfume,  KAYALI Wedding Velvet Santal  to have as you will feel like that special day in your life every time you use this perfume.   I was gifted complimentary from Kayali and Skeepers in exchange for my honest review."

As someone who loves trying new fragrances, I was especially intrigued by this scent and it has quickly become one of my new favorites. With a creamy and woody base, it features notes of White Musk, Sandalwood, Cedarwood and Jasmine and leaves you feeling romantic, captivated and embraced in its velvety warmth. I personally think it has a subtle, yet lasting scent that has a feminine and seductive feel. It layers beautifully with Kayali's 28 Vanilla and I definitely will be experimenting with layering with other fragrances in the future as well."

I don't pick up any vanilla, which Kayali perfumes tend to have, but this is unisex, so that could be why. I will wear this in evenings, but for daytime, this is a little too spicy and woody for my liking. This lasts about half a day, which is ample for nighttime use. Gifted by Kayali."

It's got depth but not in a heavy or overwhelming way and the benzoin is the perfect fit, it gives a creamy sweetness without being overly saccharine like vanilla fragrances tend to be. The cedarwood gives it a perfect woody smokiness without smelling burnt or tobacco-like. The sandalwood shines and really rounds the fragrance out into a smooth, inviting scent. It reminds me of amber musk by aerin except amber musk is more comfy/cozy and this is more cozy/alluring, it has a bit more of a come hither sexiness to it that I absolutely love! Perfect fall/winter fragrance that's suitable for daytime use and date night. It lasts for hours and even into the next day, the sillage is lovely, and it projects well without forcing your fragrance on everyone in the room. Layers really well with not a perfume, this fragrance is so delightful! Truly unisex, it doesn't smell masculine OR feminine, it just smells sexy!! Gifted by kayali"

KAYALI is known for their signature diamond shaped bottle, jeweled cap, and opulent fragrances - and you get the whole experience even with the 10mL sized bottle. Itu2019s beautiful, clean glass and comes standard with a sprayer, so application is easy and thereu2019s no dipping or rolling involved (as can be the case with some smaller sized perfumes).  The Wedding Velvet Santal 35 is a limited-release fragrance thatu2019s immediately jasmine and musk forward and then warms down into an amber, woody experience with a very light linger of soft powder. I think this EDP could be worn by both sexes for a moody, serious vibe.  Somehow I didnu2019t know that KAYALI is the fragrance arm of Huda Beauty, but knowing that now makes me more comfortable with the idea of paying a designer price. And of course Sephorau2019s return/exchange policy is great if you decide itu2019s not the scent for you after all.  I smelled this next to MG as other reviewers have stated, but I donu2019t think they are too similar. The mood may be similar, but MG is brighter and more feminine.

As the scent fades, the sweeter notes are more prominent. It faded almost completely after a few hours for me but I also didn't have any skin irritations during that time."

If I am understanding correctly (wish comments were permitted on reviews!), it seems that velvet santal is supposedly the masculine fragrance while silk santal is the feminine version? Alas, it's 2024 and we don't have to live confined to those boxes, but even if we did...could have fooled me. I do not get masculine energy from velvet santal at all; IMO, this is 100% unisex.  What I do get is a strong mental connection to the autumn months. I know, I know - again - it's supposed to remind me of weddings! Perhaps a wedding in the fall months then lol. I smell leaves falling, a cool breeze blowing in the wind. It's a very comforting fragrance to me, and VERY surprisingly for Kayali, while this one does start with a powerful blast, it mellows out into a much softer fragrance. Admittedly that characteristic makes it fantastic for layering.  Bottom line: this one was NOTHING like my expectations,  but I say that in a good way!

This is my third Kayali perfume and I love them all, but I must admit I have fallen in love a little harder with this one. Kayali Wedding Velvet Santal is such a unique fragrance. I can totally see why Mona and Hassan chose this one to be a part of their wedding fragrances. It is truly an emotion which I will try to describe in words in the best way possible. First of all, this 10ml mini version is just so cute. It is way too pretty to be a part of my vanity. The scent is woody and musky with subtle hints of floral in the background. It just feels like a warm hug that you never want to let go off. This is such a soft and decadent fragrance. I love the notes of sandalwood that surround this perfume, I find it to be very captivating and sophisticated. This one is a unisex perfume, however, I think when worn by itself, it inclines more towards the masculine side. So I layered it with a sweet vanilla based perfume for an irresistible and seductive combination. I sprayed it on my pulse points and all over my clothes for a long lasting effect. The scent stayed on for a good whole day on me. My husband could still smell it on me the next morning. I mean this perfume is just AMAZING! I need to get my hands on a bigger bottle now! #Gifted by Kayali"

Bottle looks so elegant and cute in champagne color. For me it's a sweet scent that starts with notes of Jasmine that beautifully blends with musky and woody santal noyltes thus making it irresistible. I kept smelling it over and over and I could not get over it. Longevity is medium and lasted for almost 6 hours for me. I am definitely going to buy full size. Highly recommended."

I believe the packaging should be updated to be gender-neutral, not just for men. It's not a bold, overpowering scent; rather, it's soft and delicate, almost like it's meant to blend seamlessly with the wearer's natural scent. It's light, cozy, and joyful. The fragrance transitions quite smoothly from the initial spray to the final dry down. Initially, it's more of a white floral and tea leaf scent. By the time it's fully dry, it's transformed into a woody aroma without the hint of pencil shavings. It becomes more complex as it dries, with notes of amber, leather, sandalwood, cedarwood, and a touch of tea leaves, lending it a sophisticated allure. It's perfect for those who prefer a more subtle, yet not too feminine, scent. It contains a hint of jasmine. The name Wedding Velvet Santal 35 is a perfect fit, as it evokes a smooth, velvety feel. It typically lasts around 6 hours on the skin and is overall a fantastic fragrance. Gifted by Kayali, but it is my honest opinion."
