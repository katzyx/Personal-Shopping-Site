I received this for Christmas as I am well known to have painfully dry lips, and I couldn't be more pleased. This lip mask is smooth, soft, and nourishing. I find I can wear it during the day as well as at night as it's not nearly as thick as other masks I've tried.  (like Laneige, Nyx, Elf, Kiel's, Fenty, etc) It applies super smoothly and has no distinguishable scent but doesn't smell waxy either. My lips, after only a few days, feel less dry, have fewer flakes, and I feel like they are actually getting moisturized. I absolutely recommend this product. It's got this cute little bear packaging, too, which once emptied can be reused. It's worth the price."

I wish the bottom was made of the same clear plastic bc the smooth frosted plastic made it harder to grip when opening/closing."

This lip mask is super hydrating and actually stays put for a good amount of time. Love using this as prep before applying lip products, alone as a gloss or at night before bed as a treatment through the night."
