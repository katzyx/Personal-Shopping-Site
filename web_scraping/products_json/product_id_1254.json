I havenu2019t noticed any super life changing results, however I havenu2019u2019t noticed any bad effects either.  I am someone who has a pretty sensitive scalp, I will need to wash my hair every two days or so as my scalp gets pretty itchy. I didnu2019t find this product to weigh down my hair or make my scalp itchy.   This scalp serum has a pleasant, light, and fresh scent. Itu2019s not a super heavy scent and the scent dissipates after a bit of time. I typically donu2019t like heavy scents, so this was something I enjoyed.   In terms of effectiveness, I am still using it and will update this review accordingly if I experience any adverse effects. As it stands right now, I am enjoying this serum. I like the ingredients (red clover, chana, arctic root, ginseng, and peptides). The serum is quite liquid-y and has a slip to it. It absorbed into my scalp easily and didnu2019t leave my scalp feeling sticky or heavy.   I found it to be light weight, and hydrating. I appreciate that this can be used on wet or dry hair. It was easy to incorporate into my normal hair care routine and it will be something I continue to use. I am anticipating that this will address my scalp hydration concerns without being too heavy.  Iu2019d recommend this if you are looking for a lightweight serum to help support scalp health."

The serum is lightweight, absorbs quickly, and doesnu2019t leave any greasy residue, which is a huge plus. It has a light, fresh scent that isnu2019t overpowering. Iu2019ve noticed less flakiness and even a bit more volume at my roots, which has been a nice bonus. My only reason for giving 4 stars instead of 5 is that it took a little time to see the effects, but now that theyu2019re showing, Iu2019m very happy with it. Highly recommend for anyone looking to give their scalp some extra love!"

It took me about 2 months to realize that it was serum causing the issues because I wasnt using it everyday. I even tested out stopping using the product for ~3 weeks, to get the inflammation down and make sure i have no scalp issues, and tried again to see if it really was just this product, and it really sucks that it is this serum. I used no other products in my hair or scalp (besides shampoo/conditioner) to narrow it down. It disappointing since this bottle is more than $50 and just going to get thrown away since the return policy window has closed. I just think its crazy that I cant get my money back on a product that caused rash and pain, products shouldnt do that.

After using this full bottle, I can truly say this product is an amazing scalp serum. I have tried many, and this one stands out as a favourite. The scent is clean and refreshing. It doesn't leave your scalp feeling oily after washing. I like to apply this before a workout or while doing chores to let it soak in. I also massage it into my scalp. It is like having a little spa treatment at home. I will definitely purchase this!!"

Itu2019s been about two months of using this serum and Iu2019m very happy with it. Iu2019ve noticed a ton of small new baby hairs where my hair line is, but only time will tell how much this will fill out my hair. Highly, highly recommend. The dropper takes some getting used to and itu2019s definitely not the most ideal, but it works. The smell is clean and herbal, not bad. Only complaint is that I wash my hair every two days and if I use this multiple days in a row my hair starts feeling heavy and greasy. Other than that, this has been a holy grail for me.

I took to plucking them out of frustration. However under a different stressful situation more hair started to fall out. I decided it was time to stop plucking. I saw a before and after picture with this product that after 4 months a woman with similar flyaway baby hairs at her part and hairline like mine had results I wanted. I am now about to start my 3rd bottle in 3 months and this stuff works! all those grey flyaways at my hairline are long enough to tuck behind my ears instead of just sticking straight out. I've also always had scalp issues and this helps it. It's help healed my scalp so much my Seborrheic dermatitis at my hair line has returned."

For reference, I have very dry, thinning, curly, dyed hair. I have been applying this product every night for over a month and I love the results. I am expecting even better results after the 90 day mark. PROS: - Great ingredient list: it has hyaluronic acid and peptides, together with many other amazing ingredients. It is pure skincare for the scalp. - Very hydrating: it gets absorbed by my scalp immediately leaving it feeling so hydrated. - Not greasy at all: it has a light jelly like consistency, not oily, so it doesnu2019t leave the hair feeling dirty or heavy. - It contributes to an immediate volumizing effect from the roots. - It smells amazing! - It comes in an elegant glass bottle. - It has a thin dropper that allows for a precise application directly on the scalp and preventing products waste.  CONS: - The price: it is a pricey product. I am only using it on those parts of my scalp with more sparse hair and not over the entire scalp so the bottle will last me for about  - Being glass, it is not very travel friendly (heavy and risk to break) - I donu2019t like the applicator handle because it gets slippery and makes difficult to push the top, but I can deal with it.

The reason I did not like it is that you need to leave it on for a long time and during that time it made my hair look flat and feel sticky.  I tried applying it at night, washing my hair in the morning, and applying it in the morning, washing in the evening,  I suppose if you do not mind staining your pillowcase, the overnight option is okay.  I could not go out in public with it on during the day as my hair looked awful with it on.  I was careful to use the recommended amount, part my hair, message it in, etc.  My hair is very fine and my scalp is oily so the overall result was not good.  The serum gets two stars because I had no reaction to it (my scalp is sensitive and has reacted to other serums but not this one) and the scent was fairly strong but not unpleasant.  Again, I only used a sample but I certainly would not recommend this serum for fine hair and oily scalps."

I have been using it everyday in conjunction with the ouai oral supplement and I have noticed some changes in my hair line. My main problem is hair thinning especially noticeable on my hair line. I take one ouai oral capsule in the AM and apply the ouai serum across my hairline in the PM. A little background for reference Iu2019m 32 with no kids. My hair line thinning is mostly due to genetics, me pulling my hair back tight all through middle/high school, and stress from doctorate/residency training. The BIGGEST thing that I absolutely LOVE about this serum is that itu2019s more water than oil based. For my gals that have Semi-oily to oily scalps this serum is heaven sent and will not require you to wash your hair everyday due to it looking too oily. This was extremely tough for me to find with other brands that were on the market. I massage this serum to my hairline for about 1 minute each night until the product is completely absorbed. It works great no matter how Iu2019m styling my hair. I hope this helps. The photos I included are exactly 1 month apart. Not sponsored :)"

I love the packaging of the scalp serum. It looks and feels like a quality product. However, I can't just go based off that. Normally, I would never have thought to purchase this product because of the price and thinking I wouldn't need it, but you usually get what you pay for. Right now, I've been using it for a little over a month so I know I need more time. Based on the description, it takes about 3-4 months to see any results, and for me, it's too early to tell. So far I'm liking it and not having any issues. It does help my scalp feel less dry or itchy, but I hope in a little while, I get to see some hair growth in the areas I've noticed some loss."

I usually have dry and sensitive scalp issues, especially this time of the year but after a couple of weeks using the scalp serum my scalp feels better plus it is not as itchy or irritated. I prefer to apply it right after my shower when my hair is damp and let it soak in. I also have very long thin hair and Iu2019ve notice it seems to be shinier with a bit more fullness and volume. The bottle it comes in feels luxurious. It is a heavy frosted glass bottle with a push button dropper for easy application. It also doesnu2019t have an overwhelming scent. Im not I love with the scent but it smells clean with slightly minty after notes. I will continue to keep using as past of my regular routine because of the results Iu2019ve seen with my scalp. The extra bit of shininess and volume are just bonuses from everyday use."

This serum is so lightweight that it sinks to the scalp easily and has an earthy smell that is perfect not to overpowering. I usually put it on after I wash my hair and leave it for the following day. Consistency is key when using a serum just like using a new skincare serum you are not getting results in the first day. After a month of using the serum I notice my hair being more full and thicker. It is a nice product if you want to splurge on a nice serum for your hair."

In order to follow direction I would part my hair use the one vial, then the next day part my hair differently to target various spots on my scalp. Eventually I started specifically targeting the serum on my hairline because that is my problem area I would like to have more hair. Doing this I saw improvement and was pleased. I was especially pleased at my scalp feeling better with my natural hair."

The smell is pleasant and not strong or over powering. The dropper helps make sure you reach back out scalp. I used the product when my hair was damp and it doesnu2019t feel heavy or make your hair greasy which I really liked. I did notice a difference in my scalp and that it did feel pretty hydrated after using for a few weeks. I would recommend giving this a try and I would purchase in the future after this bottle is finished!"

I am 5 months postpartum and started losing my hair and I have always had a dry, itchy scalp. Iu2019ve tried a couple oils and serums made for the scalp, but it always made my hair look greasy, so that was a no. First impression, the scent is clean, but light. Now the first time I used this serum I used too much (less is more) and my hair almost looked greasy. So I have it another shot and used less and it absorbed right away and you couldnu2019t see any in my hair. Now that Iu2019ve consistently been using it, my scalp isnu2019t dry or itchy. And I believe my hair isnu2019t falling out nearly as much as it was. I recommend anyone with any of the issues Iu2019ve had try this."

After about 5 weeks of daily use, my family and coworkers began to comment on my hair's improved length and thickness. I actually had a bald spot from parting my hair down the middle and this serum grew the hair back. I saw overall growth of about an inch, which is much faster than my hair grows on its own."

The serum is pretty thin so it's so easy to spread and it has a really nice scent. This product was easy to apply but it went fairly quickly. After the first few days my hair felt nice, but then shortly after my scalp started getting itchy right in the front and top of my head. My hair got extremely frizzy and stringy and started falling out more than usual. My hair is super thin to begin with and this product did me no favors. I do not recommend this at all."
