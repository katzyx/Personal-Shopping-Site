I can't get through a day without it smudging all over my eyelids (and I'm not even rubbing my eyes to make it smudge). I end up always looking like a raccoon. It it impossible to remove with make up remover at the end of day (a product I've never had an issue with removing mascara in the past). I also find it super clumpy and it does not give consistent length/supply of mascara throughout the lash. I never write reviews, but this has been weighing on me for some time so I felt compelled to say something. Not worth the money."

I would put it on first thing in the morning, go snorkeling until dusk, then go out to dinner. We would get back to our condo late at night and my mascara looked like I had just put it on. This will now forever be my go to mascara. I wish it was a little more affordable, but it is definitely worth the price. *I received this product for free from Ilia and PINCHme in exchange for my honest review."

For day-to-day wear, this mascara is fine. I did experience some occasional smudging. I found the hourglass wand a bit challenging to navigate, especially on my lower lashes. I also feel like the wand shape caused the product to clump up in a weird way when being returned to the tube, and the stopper eventually got semi-clogged with clumpy product that would then transfer to the lashes. I think this would be a good product for someone who only uses mascara on the upper lash line."

I definitely will not be buying this one again, but if you like clumpy lashes, it might be for you. I'll stick with their limitless mascara going forward."

The wand applicator is nice and while it did provide a little bit of volume, I did experience smudging throughout the day.

It hasn't clumped, gives a nice length and subtle volume to my lashes and doesn't flake after a few hours.  I put it through quite a few gym workouts including a spin class with sweat in my eyes and did not have any stinging and it stayed mostly in tact! I gave it four stars because It starts to get a little clumpy if I try to build up to a super glam volume. Also the brush shape doesn't fit my eye size so it builds volume in the wrong spot unless I use only the tip which takes longer to apply.  Overall I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a great every day clean mascara. I received this for free from Pinchme in exchange for my honest review."

I sweat a lot and I've worn it at the gym. Even if it isnt waterproof, I didn't notice a lot of smudging even though there was some. While the mascara lengthens my lashes, I do wish that it would add a bit more volume for a more dramatic look. I do still like it though and appreciate that it's a clean product."

I tested this over several weeks. Upon opening it I noticed it was a little on the watery side. I have thin straight lashes so I often need a thicker product. I applied 3-5 coats, but was unable to achieve the level of volume I was looking for and because of the liquidy texture applied a good amount to my eye lid as well. The next few times I used it I applied a base coat of another mascara and then followed up with the ILIA mascara. This helped a bit. I did notice after about a week the formula did thicken up a bit (I assume from oxygen being introduced to the tube) and it applied much easier. The highlights of this product are: It does not flake, It does not smear, and it washes off easily."

Personally, I believe ILIA knocked it out of the park with this mascara! It's made with clean ingredients, it doesn't leave flakes on my face, and it doesn't look or feel heavy on my eyelashes. It's a great mascara for anyone who has sensitive eyes too. It's not waterproof so it washes off easily, just make sure you don't wear it on a rainy day!"

It removes well, but does tend to leave a little residue the next day even with thorough cleansing, so 4/5 stars."

For starters this brand is one that I fully trust and have had a lot of success with different products of theirs. They make products that truly perform without chemicals that I don't trust. As for this volumizing mascara, I give it five stars as I really like how well it performs. It has a large fluffy brush that helps to apply mascara without too many coats or without clumping. This does not smudge terribly for me. The packaging is very simple but easy to hold. This also removes easily using an oil-based cleanser followed by a foaming cleanser. Overall a great product that I highlyrecommend"

HOWEVER, I have been purchasing this mascara on my own for a while now because I really like it a lot (I usually purchase the mini because I use several brands and they tend to go bad before I can get my money's worth from a full size tube).   Pros: this gives a really full, soft look.  It can be more dramatic if you really layer it on, but I love that it's full and soft and natural looking. Cons: because I have deep set eyes, most regular (non-tubing) mascaras will transfer to my brow bone throughout the day, and this is no exception.  However, it is minimal and if this isn't something you normally struggle with, you likely won't have any issues with this transferring or flaking."

The reason is that when you're outside and it is hot out and/or humid, it all gets clumpy and soft and your lashes just join together in big clumps. Its like it never sets - just stays sort of gunky. You can start out with it dried down and set just fine, but once you enter a hot or humid area, like near the beach etc, the mascara softens on your lashes and just sort of melts and the lashes just clump together. It's a mess. It leaves racoon eyes on top and bottom."

Don't get me wrong, it definitely makes my lashes more noticeable but not in a dramatic, lengthening or fuller way. It is very natural looking and not clumpy or spidery.

My main complaint is that I have noticed it does transfer on my hooded eyelids if it's warm out or if my face is just oily (it is not water proof).

I feel like it's too thick & the shape of the wand makes it difficult to apply evenly to all of my lashes. It went on uneven & clumpy, I had to use an eyelash brush every time to separate large clumps. It also flakes somewhat throughout the day which is a frustration of mine with mascara. Lastly, it's very hard to remove! Leaves dark black under my eyes.

Many that I've tried in the past don't make the cut. I had tried other ILIA products that I love, but never mascara. So I was very excited to try this Volumizing Mascara by ILIA. I'm honestly amazed at how much I love this mascara! It makes my lashes look long, dark, thick, and beautiful. Plus, it's clean and fragrance free. I absolutely love the unique shape of the wand; it really fans out and fills in my lashes. I will say, the first time I used it I over applied and didn't give it enough time to dry and so it smudged. But, now that I've gotten the hang of it, it never smudges or flakes. It's my absolute favorite mascara that I've ever owned; and I currently own six different brands of mascara! Also, it comes off with micellar water really well without damaging my lashes. I highly, highly recommend this mascara for anyone that wants beautiful, thick eyelashes!"

One coat gives a natural look, but two coats? Oh, honey! That's where the magic happens. My lashes go from u201cmehu201d to u201cwowza!u201d in seconds. And the best part? No clumps, no spider legsu2014just beautifully separated, defined lashes.  But let's talk results. My lashes practically touch my eyebrows (okay, maybe not that extreme, but you get the idea). The volumizing effect is unreal! And the length? I've got the kind of lashes that usually play hide-and-seek, but ILIA coaxed them out of hiding. They're longer, fluttery, and oh-so-flirty.  Worried about smudging? Fear not! This mascara doesn't flake or smudge. I've worn it from morning meetings to late-night karaoke sessions, and my lashes stayed put. Plus, it's a breeze to removeu2014no tugging, no raccoon eyes.  In summary, the ILIA Fullest Volumizing Mascara is a must-try for anyone who wants va-va-voom lashes without sacrificing clean beauty. Trust me, you won't be disappointed!"

I definitely saw increased volume upon application. I tend to apply by wiggling root to tip and going over the lashes 2-3 times per application. Idk if that means I do 2 applications or 4-6 applications (?), but I tend to curl, swipe, brush, swipe, brush (I use a metal eyelash brush). I genuinely love the results so far!"

The brush on the Ilia mascara does a really good job at depositing the mascara without clumping.  It also still gives separation!

The brush reminds me of the Lash Paradise by L'Oreal, it is big enough to get every single lash coated. The formula is kind of thin and doesn't give that thickness and pigment right away. The good thing is this mascara can be built up with a couple coats. Removal is fairly easy (I use micellar water) and it stays nicely throughout the day. Personally this is a great mascara to layer. I use it as my base to coat every lash and separate them, then go in with another to thicken and make more dramatic."

I liked that it was thinner product so it wasn't heavy or weighing on my eyelashes. It didn't flake or clump up they had nice separation and wash off was easy . I didn't have to scrub and rub or use 3 different products just to remove my mascara.. I like how the end of the wand was a little smaller to get those little lashe in the corners and not get it all over my eye lids . This was a great surprise and I absolutely loved this product will definitely get this one when I run out."

Plus, it's free from harsh scents, making it suitable for my sensitive eyes.  The performance of this mascara is remarkable. After a few swipes, I instantly see impressive definition and length.

Every Ilia beauty product I have, I love, it's a great beauty brand. The violin shaped brush, helps my lashes stick out, usually you can't see my lashes, I recommend this mascara, no smudging, so it doesn't look like I have black eyes. Two thumbs up."

I normally wear waterproof mascara because I have seasonal allergies so with this traditional mascara, I just have to be careful not to touch my eyes and cause it to smudge.

This formula is lightweight and buildable, and stays flexible and soft all day. I only put on one coat for the included photo, but two coats is probably ideal for that full effect. It is a little clumpy so I have to pick the clumps out once I let it dry for a bit. I've only used it for a few days so I can't vouch for any benefits of the added arginine and vitamin B5 in the product. Overall, it's a nice mascara and I'd like to try a waterproof version."

I hate waterproof mascaras because I have sensitive eyes and they make my lashes fall out when removing makeup.   I will admit when this product gets old, it does melt under my eyes so I will be replacing it every six months like recommended. The only problem I have with this is that TOO much products clunks onto the brush and can make my eyelashes pretty clunky so i have to take a clean spoolie to evenly brush out my lashes every time. I love this mascara for going out/event nights. I have the other lengthening mascara too from this brand which i wear everyday and have less of that clunky problem with."

It's so hard to apply it to your eyes without it getting all over your eyelids, and its especially hard to get it on your lower lash line without making a mess. It does give you crazy volume and length, I just wish the product was less messy."

Not sure if it's due to flaking, but I don't notice any flaking under my eyes. Burns like heck.

With how massive the brush is, you end up with way too much product on the brush when applying to your lashes, which just causes them to clump up & get stringy. I end up having to scrape off 90% of the product from the brush on the rim of the tube & then I can get some control over my application. I do however prefer this formula over Ilia's Limitless mascara, it's less crumbly & more wear resistant. When I can control the amount of product on the brush, I do find I get nice volume in my lashes, but obviously not much length. I end up layering with my Tower28 MakeWaves mascara to add length, the combo seems to work well. If only they significantly reduced the size of the brush, this could be added into my rotation of mascara... but as it stands, it's a hard pass."

I am lucky to have naturally long lashes so I prefer a more volumizing mascara that is a thicker formula. If you have shorter lashes, then I would go with their other mascara which is thinner and provides more length. This mascara stays on my lashes all day and makes them look so thick and long. I wore it for my wedding all day with no issues. It also comes off easily with a makeup eraser cloth and water without taking out any eyelashes. I really recommend this is you have longer lashes and non-watery eyes."

First it's intimidating for someone who barely wears make up to go in- but i kept With my research and price limit. This separates my lashes, beautiful and doesn't clump, and adds some length similar to my other product. Hasn't bothered my eyes and i like The applicator.

I liked the lengthening one but was missing volume, so I thought this would be worth trying. I'm blessed with naturally thick and long lashes, so there are very few mascaras that really just don't work for me and this is unfortunately one. My lashes never look as nice as I want them to with this mascara, and there are a few contributing factors. One, this mascara is so messy. The wand is very large, which isn't a particular problem for me, but because this formula is so waxy and takes forever to dry, you will get it on your lid and it will make a giant mess. If you do get this on your lid, your eyeshadow is screwed. It never completely wipes off and leaves black smudges, even when you wait minutes for the mascara to dry. Then, it somehow ends up smudged on my lower lash line even though I don't apply this to my bottom lashes! I did that once and learned quickly that this is absolutely not meant for lower lashes. Lastly, this formula is very heavy, wet and waxy and will ruin any curl on your lashes. Again, lash curl is not usually an issue for me with other mascara's, but no matter how often I re-curl my lashes with this mascara, they can't hold up with the weight of this formula.   I will use up this tube of mascara since it's all that I have, but I really don't recommend this mascara."

The bulbous end at the back makes it impossible to get into the root of my lashes to get the mascara applied. I can't build it as much as I want and my lashes end up sticking together. No flutter here. It also gets all over my eye area as the brush touches everywhere as I'm applying, even if I'm careful. The worst part is that the formula is very uncomfortable! It is so sticky and heavy. It stays feeling sticky all day. My top and bottom lashes stick together when my eyes press closed more than normal blinking. I got this in the Sephora favorites set and I would not purchase in the future."

I used to use Av*da mascara years ago and I think they discontinued the formula I used to purchase. My point is that the ILIA lengthening mascara reminds me of that formula. Anyway, I tried the ILIA lengthening formula first and really enjoy that one. It has a rose oil scent and separates/lengthens the lashes well. More importantly, it doesn't irritate my eyes. That said, though I prefer a formula that both lengthens and adds volume, I need more volume than length, so I decided to try this formula. This formula does not have the rose oil scent, which was a disappointment. Also, as some reviewers have mentioned, it's kind of goopy/sticky, especially in hot weather; it will leave raccoon eyes/flakes if you're sloppy. In that regard, I think M*lk's Kush is better even though that one is goopy, too. If they added the rose oil and made this a less sticky/less likely to migrate under your eyes formula, this would be a staple. But as it is now, I'm on the fence. I'd purchase the lengthening formula again before this one."

Unfortunately, l'm sorry to say that this was NOT it, not even close to being as good.   Instead what I discovered is truly one of the worst mascara's I've ever tried. It has a terrible wand that holds way too much product. The formula is so wet that it takes ages to dry. It gives some volume but zero length. So you end up with short, stumpy lashes that won't lengthen no matter how much you try to build them up. Not even a little bit!   Also when you do try to put on more than 2 coats it just ends up a short, stumpy, clumpy, wet, ugly mess.   After trying this I'm really surprised to see all the positive reviews here. The only thing that I can think of is that these people probably have naturally long lashes. But if that's not you, and you have short, fine lashes then I would definitely keep looking.   If do you want to try a clean mascara by this brand the Limitless Lash has a much better formula. It's still a bit wet, and won't give you a ton of volume or anything, but the wand is better and the formula more buildable than this one.  Though I have to be honest, I've had such a terrible experience with this mascara that I am turned off by this brand at the moment and won't be buying anything from them again for a long time."

This mascara instantly lifts, lengthens and volumizes my lashes, and I'm able to build it up for more drama without it getting clumpy on me. I haven't experienced any burning (even after tearing up) with this mascara, nor do I end up looking like a raccoon at the end of the day.

I'm so glad I gave this mascara a try.. it does everything my waterproof mascara as do without being waterproof, meaning it is much easier to remove. That being said, this formula definitely still stays out and doesn't smudge or transfer on me (and I do have rather oily eyelids)."

This stuff adds nice length and separation and stays on well throughout the day even without the addition of an eyelid primer to stop oiliness from breaking it down!

The weird brush size also made it so that every time I pulled out the applicator from the bottle, it left this large clump of mascara on the end of it, which I then had to either wipe off onto the bottle or onto a napkin (effectively wasting a ton of extra mascara) each time. I'm not sure what it different either with this formula, but it reallyy irritated my eyes. I tried wearing it for several days and by the end of each work day my eyes were red, glassy and burning.

Lashes are very well defined even with three coats! It's a buildable mascara and does feel weightless. Especially for a volumizing mascara. 100% better than BTS mascara. I've had experiences with volumizing mascaras over time getting clumps of mascara on the wand. I cannot speak for that currently because only used it a few times. Time will tell...

I have never and I mean NEVER found a regular mascara, let alone a clean one - that holds a curl, and makes my lashes so pretty! Considering that it's clean, this mascara does make my lashes look considerably darker, thicker and longer. I've also been using this mascara for about two months and have noticed that my lashes are looking healthier overall.  This mascara is about as close to perfection as any mascara has ever gotten for me. It holds a curl (probably due to the beeswax?), makes my lashes look lush and has nourishing ingredients. A total HG for me! Ilia don't you ever discontinue this magical mascara!!!"

I can't use it alone since like most mascaras, it weighs my lashes down and straighten the curls immediately. However, I'm able to use this as a layering mascara on top of something that holds my lashes' curl. It adds significant volume and if applied well, builds the length too. I haven't noticed any smudging either with all-day wear, which is always a plus. Personally I like this a lot better than ILIA's previous cult favorite limitless lash mascara, which didn't do much for my tiny lashes at all. This one is a game changer and I'm happy to see its release. The brush is fairly large and loaded with product, so be prepared for some smearing on the lids during application. Highly recommend."

This is a volumizing mascara, and it does, but the wand applies a whole lot of product at once and the bristles are such that it doesn't separate your lashes to balance the intense application of product, leaving them looking clustered together and spidery (though curled). Honestly, it's a less effective version of the bite upswing, missing that special oomph the bite can give my lashes. Also, I have deeper set eyes and often get mascara marks on my lids and this formula is REAL tough to take off with a spoolie. That's a small thing, but if you do eyeshadow before lashes like me, it gets annoying."

Yes, I did have to clean the brush a little bit before applying but I always do that with every mascara so I don't see why people are complaining about that.

To be clear, I only wear it on my top lashes. So this transfers below, which is a huge bummer. Sticking to the Limitless lash since that's not as smudgy."

I have very long full natural lashes and therefore have difficulty with clumping with most of the mascara's I've tried in the past. I was pleasantly surprised to find that this mascara was extremely volumizing without causing clumps! It created beautiful, very full, and voluminous lashes that didn't feel heavy or weighed down like I have experienced with other mascara's specifically geared to provide volume. I was also pleased with the products ingredients as it contains provitamin B5 and Arginine. I usually end up loosing alot of lashes when removing my mascara but with this product removal was simple, painless, but most of all.. I didn't notice any fall out of my lashes. I feel reassured knowing the B5 and Arginine are helping to enhance the fullness of my natural lashes and also strengthen them with these fortifying and nourishing ingredients. This was definitely a plus as I said before the other mascaras I use that are able to provide this look with usage ultimately tend to damage my lashes afterwards. The packaging of this product was also impressive. It was very pretty but also felt and looked like a high end luxury brand made product. I would definitely recommend this product. Especially for those on the fence who haven't ever tried this brand before like myself. You won't regret it! I only took one star away for the price as there are a few drugstore products that stand up to this product but are at a much lower price point. That being said, compared to the other high end mascara's..this is actually a pretty good reasonable price!"

You have to clean so much product off the brush to even use it.  And if you're a wiggler (from lid to ends) it will clump even removing most of the product. I did find it goes on better if you go straight from root to tip without the wiggle. But it still can clump. It's definitely not a mascara you can put on in a hurry. For me it usually also requires an eyelash comb to comb out the clumps. If you have the time to puttz around with it it can be beautiful though. And I should also mention that sometimes it does transfer. Not all the time but definitely more than my staple. It does feel nice as well though, not hard.  I believe the indented portion of the brush may just be a little too indented picking up too much product."

Almost mascaras irritate and burn my eyes after wearing 6+ hours and I've worn this literally 12+ hours with no issues."

Thats why im giving it 2 stars....my issue with this mascara is it runs...like crazy. Its so wet that even after 3 minutes if my lashes touch my upper lid it leaves black stains. Maybe it needs to dry out for a couple weeks but many mascaras, including drugstore do the same as this one does and doesnt run. The Maybelline in the long pink tube...sky high thats it...does a MUCH better job at a fraction of the price"
