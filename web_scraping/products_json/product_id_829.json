I used 3-4 drops of this oil on my ends and immediately could see a difference.   The overly dry ends turned silky and held its curl.    I highly recommend this product.   The K18 conditioning products my hair stylist has used after a color process  leave my hair soft and manageable."

I have low porosity mostly straight hair thatu2019s frizzy and mildly damaged (no matter how I treat it trust me) and this is my SAVIOUR!! All I did was straighten my hair with a hot tool (use hair heat protection!! Even with protection you can still be damaged) and then I put some of this in my hair and itu2019s GORGEOUS!! Itu2019s soft, straight, lightweight, and not frizzy at all! I love this but Iu2019m notttt sure if the full size is worth the money because as a middle class maybe lower middle class person, itu2019s overly expensive. And I have to use two whole droppers full each time."
