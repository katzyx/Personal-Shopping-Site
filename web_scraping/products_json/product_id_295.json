I love it but it doesn't stop the frizz that naturally pops up in my hair when I don't use heat on it. I added this product to try and add a little bit of hold. I love that I can add a pump or two of this product and I can control how much hold I add. For me, somewhere between 1 pump and 2 pumps is perfect. If I have blow dried my hair but skipped straightening, 1 pump is perfect to keep it mostly tamed down. I highly recommend."

It doesn't entirely tame my hair, but it makes it look extremely decent. I have ultra dry voluminous puffy hair, the wavy type. A wavy type that can't be defined on their own. It needs help from products to hold a curl. My hair have zero difficulty in getting volume. I don't need hairspray to get that big puffy hair look from the 80s. So, if you have my type of hair and is looking to reduce the puffiness, you will like this product. After I wash my hair, I apply it to wet hair. Several pumps. And I let it air dry. For more frizz control, I use their One-Minute Transformation Styling Cream on dry hair."

This my opinion on this product, I have bleached yet pretty healthy hair. It might work differently on someone who has virgin hair or less processed hair."

Smells oh sooo good like a salon, smooths hair so nice when hair dries, I put it in after my shower, hair damp, and into a bun, top of hair is so soft and not frizzy or many flyaways like usually is.

Lovely stuff, hair is seriously so soft and this stuff is perfect for summertime with thick hair, and frizz with humidity. Smells so good!!!"

I was expecting a similar serum texture as the Olaplex N\u00b09 with a finish similar to an oil but that is not at all what this is.   I used it on dry hair (as I often do oils and serums) and found that it sat on top of my hair. I don't like the feel of it in my hair. maybe it would be helpful to try wirh towel dried hair but for now, it's a no from me!   I have long naturally straight hair for reference."

It makes my hair sleek and exceptionally shiny without drying it out (the only other product that makes my hair gleam like this is BioSilk which really dries out my hair), it's soft and polished and my frizz and flyaways are very well controlled, even in humid weather. I mix it with a lighter, more fluid oil to make it more viscous and easier to apply throughout my damp hair before I blow dry-brush it and I look like I've come from the salon every single time I use this. I also really like that it is a heat protectant too so I don't have to use multiple products in my hair. This did everything it claimed to on my hair, and yes there is very noticeable glitter in the product which gets left behind on your hands but it comes off when you rinse your hands under water so that's not even an issue."

But it actually did nicely, so that was a relief.  The scent is light and I like it.   Color Wow Pop & Lock Fizz Control and Glossing Serum worked quite well on my dry, (frizzy!) hair. From a lot of over-processing in the past, not too many products can decrease the frizz that much.  I tried the serum on both wet and dry hair. On my wet hair I really was hoping that it would tame my frizz and it actually did a great job. On dry hair I was hoping for some shine to brighten up my dull hair. I worked it through the mid-shaft and it did a pretty good job making my hair look a bit shinier.  The only negative I'd say is that the product claims to lock in your hair's color and add improve the texture. I didn't find that happened for me at all.  But all in all I would say this is a good product for frizz control and shine, and especially if you are like me and have a difficult time finding a product that works well on frizzy hair."

I have thick wavy hair and when used whether I blow dry or air dry it immediately dries out my hair and makes it feel really stiff .. I also would have a lot of glitter all over my hands to wash off .. will not purchase again."
