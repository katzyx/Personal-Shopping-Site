Im growing out my wavy/curly hair, and I have no clue what Im doing. lol, trying to brush it and ripping all my hair out. A wide tooth comb and this oil have done wonders for my hair. The smell is a bit strong. It smells of licorice and mint and I don't like licorice but it's okay. It's not foul. I even tried it as a body oil since it says so in the description. It's very nice on the skin! It absorbed fast, no residue. I have some hair that is straight that I'm growing out from hot tool. Those portions of my hair do not look great with this oil, so I avoid them. It's probably not great for straight hair gals."

I wish the product had directions directly on the box rather than having to scan QR code and open website to read directions.  This smells amazing, smells exactly what a fresh hair cut smells like, the smell of your hair after leaving the salon.  Oil is nice, less is more and I only used four drops: I  think that was too much for me. I have 3b dyed hair, I think two drops would work well for my hair type.

I also use them before tying up my hair in a loose bun before going to sleep, and in the morning my hair is less frizzy. My hair is kinda thin and I usually have to stay away from things that could potentially make it oily, but using just a few drops and spreading them evenly I don't have any problems.

I have super thick wavy/curly coarse hair and i put it on frequently as a last step on my beauty routine and it gives a nice shine and hydration.

Iu2019ve tried many hair oils & this is more then likely one of my least favorites due to the scent, and the way that it lays on your hair, doesnu2019t absorb, makes your hair feel sticky and then the next day still dry.

At this point I've gotten my sister, her boyfriend, and my mom to use this oil and they all love it. I have thick natural hair and the nozzle does a great job of getting to my scalp. I highly recommend this!"
