In fact, I even started joking with some of my friends I need to get preemptive Botox or something for my crazy eye wrinkles. The thing was, I only ever felt like that while wear THIS concealer. It settles into your fine lines and pores like no business leaving a crazy texture. It also feels permanently sticky and heavy no matter how much powder I use. Yes the coverage is great, but unfortunately for me, just not worth it. Iu2019ve resorted to using my expired concealer that I have to scrape the lid for just so I donu2019t have to use this one."

I definitely feel it works best for layering and as a step in the process after full coverage, rather than on it own. For the sale price I definitely think itu2019s worth it!"

This productu2019s full coverage could be used in drag if there was more product in the tube, itu2019s pretty solid.   While there are some nice attributes about this product, hereu2019s where it falls a little short for me. Packaging, I have to store this upright and I must insert the doh foot back into the tube precisely for fear of product catching on the rim and building up/ getting everywhere. This is common with concealers, but it seems like this design is a bit messier. As other users have mentioned, the shade range is a bit difficult to find the correct undertone, I agree.   Glad I purchased when they were having a Presidentsu2019 Day sale and it was half off."

For longer lasting wear, I suggest using a primer.   I put it on top of my natural mineral sunblock and it matches the finish very well.   Great for mature skin and those with large pores because it doesn't settle into the lines and pores, but blurs the textures.  CAN WE HAVE A FOUNDATION VERSION OF THIS TOO?"

I went to the lengths of putting it in a plastic bag to keep it separated from other makeup if I took it in my makeup bag to avoid a big mess. I thought this might be user error so in my repurchase I took care to clean the lid between uses...it happened every time no matter what I did .... over  times.

Decided to try this, along with a few other Rose Inc. products.   I used this for about 3 months and just could not fall in love with it. Few things that left me struggling with liking this:   1. The applicator is HUGE. Way too big and makes it difficult to control application.  2. Product builds up and spills out around the side of the tube. This leaves a mess on the outside of the package and wastes product.  3. Coverage is very dense and thick. I felt like it was making me breakout. I also felt like it gave me a much more caked on makeup look than what I prefer.   I give 2 stars because it is a very fully coverage concealer. For me, it was non-drying. I don't have a ton of fine lines so didn't see much settling, except a bit in the under eye area. Not my fave concealer but not the worst I've ever used.   This product feels mismatched in the rest of the product line. I purchased the skin tint serum (Rose Inc. doesn't have a full coverage foundation). The skin tint is so lightweight, yet this concealer is extremely pigmented and dense. It's an odd choice for sure in this product lineup."

Unfortunately, it comes with an enormous doe-foot, which is really confusing to me. Putting one dot under each eye ends up being way too much for me. What I've found works really well is applying one dot to the back of my hand, and then dipping my brush in and then applying to my undereyes. One dot on the back of my hand is enough for both eyes and spot concealing any blemishes on my face. Once it's on, it looks quite lovely and lasts all day.  My only other complaint is that there need to be more shades. It's too pigmented of a product for so few shades!"

Also easy to make it look cakey (how many times can I use this word in one review? lol) by setting it with too much powder. So, it took me a while to figure out how to best use it, but overall, because it wears well and because it will last for a long time I would repurchase."

I use a tiny bit of power just to prevent it from settling into this one deep line under my eye but, otherwise, I don't need to fuss with it much. Also, when I tell you this stuff lasts all day, I mean it lasts ALL day. I have the oiliest eyelids and holy cow this stuff never creases. It's stunning.  That being said, it's definitely not dewy like it claims. It sets to an almost powdery finish and, again, my super oily eyelids don't crease. So, I don't think this would be good for dry skin. Like, at all. I think it would likely make dry skin babes look super patched and crusty. To me, it's sort of like the skin tint they sell. I have oily skin and that stuff also looks and wears like a dream for me but everyone I know with dry skin HATES it.   So, long story short, this stuff is definitely perfect for oily skin but if you have dry skin, you've been warned! Giving it four stars because the marketing is definitely off but I love it anyway."

It is SO pigmented, but you really do only need a little bit. All the other reviews that mention it caking up or not staying are probably using too much. As long as you moisturize well, I find this goes on beautifully and is really versatile all over the face, you just need to use WAY less than you are used to. I use a brush for evening out larger patches of my face and a beauty blender for under the eyes. It has a really beautiful skin like look upon first application, but it does need to be set. Still trying to play around with the right setting powder, as my Fenty powder doesn't seem to do the trick with this one. I'll probably end up mixing LX 050 and LX 010, since the LX 050 matches my face but isn't brightening enough for under my eyes. And because I like the formula so much, I'll go on the hunt for a powder that works with it, because it is really that good. Hopefully they'll release more shades in the future so I can save myself all the extra work."

The extra large applicator makes no sense to me-- it should be extra small! It clung to my dry patches and was very difficult to blend into my skin, with or without the tinted serum. I think this might work great for someone who uses a full coverage foundation, but the Rose Inc tinted serum has the lightest possible coverage, so they just don't pair well. I'm so perplexed that these two products come from the same company and are meant to pair together, because they didn't for me. I got better results pairing the serum, with Tarte Shape Tape and/or with my cheapo Wet n Wild redness correcting primer."

I tried different  applications and varying the amount of product each time but it still didn't work for me. I only apply a tiny bit on the corners or my eyes and a little dot on the forehead which I spread to the chin with a brush. There is a lot of product in the tube and I had hoped to use it as a combination of concealer and foundation since that's how I used all my concealers and that's how it was marketed. Sadly this is going back and I will stick to my old concealer.  I have noticed that a lot of the highly rated reviews, this one included, are from accounts that received this product as an incentive or part of a marketing offer. This makes me doubt the accuracy of the reviews in general. I noticed this on another product I purchased. In the long run this isn't a good practice for Sephora to have since this and the other highly (and inaccurately) rated product, IMO, is going back creating waste of resources."

It really did help me with my dark circles with two layers. If I had gotten my exact shade, it would have been great. However, it still worked out because I mixed it with Fenty's Pro Filt'r Instant Retouch Concealer (410) + a Tati beauty sponge. Blending this out with a brush didn't work for me, and it didn't work too well with a Beauty Blender either, not sure why but it just didn't.  I don't wear makeup too often, but I am tired of having my concealer not last underneath my eyes. My dark circles are truly dark and I truly want them concealed! Fenty doesn't do that on it's own. Nars does sometimes, but I hate the applicator. I also haven't tried Charlotte Tilbury, Lancome, ABH, or Pat McGrath yet. I think it's worth the money. Hope this review isn't too long, and I hope it helps someone. I am glad I got this one and added to my collection. I'm not buying products just to have them.

            "review_text": "This concealer is amazing! First off, it is definitely more so a hybrid of concealer and foundation because it does such a great job at also covering your face if you want too. It is very nice, but you have to make sure you have good, prepped skin. If its dry and you haven't done your skincare routine, don't even bother.   I am a Hispanic woman that is in the light medium range. I am not light, but I am not medium, if that makes sense. During the summer I do pick up a bit more color, so I am more medium during that time. So, trying to find the perfect matches are always a struggle. And Hispanic, Latina women also want in on gorgeous new products from brands like Rose Inc.   That being said I purchased LX060 and LX070 which I found I am a mixture of both (More of the LX070, I use the LX 060 (w/ LX 070) more so around under my eyes to give me that brightening effect). I had originally bought the LX 090 but it was too dark on me and too yellow. I tried it a couple of times and BLENDED it out just to make sure, but it was still too dark and could notice that face/neck line thing when you have the wrong shade.    I do think Rose Inc. needs more ranges of this concealer. The ones they have are great, but some people are a mix of both. Please come out with more shades!!!   Also, this concealer while hydrating and gorgeous, does tend to be on the sticky as another reviewer pointed out. However, it is also very much so on the dewy side. You won't have a matte, velvety feel at all. I tried using on top of this the Laura Mercier setting powder and it just made my skin oilier which was odd. Normally when I wear it without a setting powder it looks like I am glowing/dewy, but when I put on the setting powder, an hour later it looked like I was SWEATING, not dewy. So, I do think the formulation needs a tad bit more work though.  All in all, lovely concealer and Rose Inc seems to be off to a great start (so far)."

That said, it definitely feels like it has a few quirks to the formula that need to be worked around.   First thing, LX10 is my PERFECT shade match. Literally perfect. I've never had such an excellent shade match and I will repurchase for that alone, I'm very difficult to match and have to colour correct most products to even get close, but blue mixers can sometimes make products look odd depending on the lighting. Having something this good out of the tubs = LIFESAVER! Many fair neutral shades are not fair OR neutral. This one is, and I REALLY hope they make a skin tint or serum foundation in the same shade because I would be all over it. My favourite way to use this is actually used sparingly blended all over the face - it wears better than any foundation I've used and looks amazing. I also like that it's extremely lightweight and I think you get a good amount of product even if the up-front cost is a bit pricey.  There are a few downsides. First, I do find this a little bit of an interesting formula. It's pretty pigmented, but compared to some other higher coverage concealers I've used, it has this odd combination of having both sort of a sticky quality in that it wants to stay where you put it, but also feeling oddly watery. Finger-blending over unprimed skin on a low/no makeup day doesn't seem to work well, that kind of shifts it around and the pigment doesn't quite want to settle, it does best with a brush and ok with a sponge as long as it's HARDLY damp (any significant dampness wipes it right off). It also does best over a really tacky primer like the Milk Hydroboost, IMO. Otherwise I find the pigment can settle slightly unevenly on the skin and cake up or really cling to dry patches. Also I think the shade range could be improved, the very fair and very deep ends could both be expanded."

It takes the edge off undereye circles with a subtle but definite illuminating effect.  A little goes. a long way and the applicator may provide too much.  so I dab a bit on back of my hand and apply with a concealer brush to inner corner of eye, and diminishing amounts outward; then to nose and chin as necessary.  Shades: this was hard to decide. .  For reference I had been using Make Up For Everu2019s Lift concealer in 01 pink beige and Lift Foundation in 01 Porcelain..  LX 030 was a great match ( I think LX010 would have been too light - it is very light.)  No strong fragrance either which is great.  Definite recommend!"

Itu2019s a nice medium coverage, very light-feeling concealer. Perfect for no make-up makeup. Comparable to Nars Radiant Creamy Concealer (LX 110 dupes Nars Caramel), but you need way less product. Very hydrating and doesnu2019t crease (given you donu2019t over-apply). Itu2019s also self-setting which is great. Only cons are the limited shade range and that unlike the Nars Radiant Creamy where the first swipe gives you medium coverage, you have to build up to medium coverage as the first few dots give you light coverage."

I prev. used shape tape which was too drying on me so I love how this didn't look or feel dry, it didn't settle into my fine lines, and didn't look cakey BUT was surprisingly med-full coverage and went a long way with just a few dots. Will definitely get a lot of use out of it. Honestly, I will be repurchasing and until it gives me a reason not to I'll be sticking to this! My biggest con would be the shade range - I got color matched via the app and the original shade LX010 I got was way too light. I made it work but definitely wanted something closer to my shade. Got the LX050 after shade matching myself in store since I'm usually a golden undertone but that waa too yellow. Got shade matched in store by an associate and voila LX030 was it. I thought it'd be too pink so I was a bit nervous but it worked perfectly on my face so I think its worth going in store for your shade since it isnt all that true to the description. More ranges/accurate descriptions/variety of swatches would help? But other than that, I went back 2-3x because I liked the formulation so much lol so definitely worth the buy."

The model who appeared to be the closest match to me was 150. When I used the shade match tool on the Rose Inc website, that was also the shade they gave me. It has come today and it is way too dark for me. Itu2019s darker than my skintone so I definitely canu2019t use it under my eyes. And itu2019s a bit warm for a contour, so Iu2019ll probably give it to a friend. The models seem to be way off when it comes to the concealer shade. My real best match would probably be 110 or 120 and Iu2019m darker than both of those models. Iu2019d recommend buying this concealer in person! There range for darker skin tones also needs some work. This is a trendy brand and itu2019s a shame that huge part of the population wonu2019t be able to find a shade match. As far as consistency and finish goes, itu2019s a beautiful concealer. I like the dewy finish. And the packaging is also so beautiful. Itu2019s just a shame I donu2019t have my correct shade, and that some people wonu2019t be able to find theiru2019s at all!"

Additonally, this concealer nicely adjusts to the skin tone and the doe-foot applicator facilitates a precise application of the product . The coverage is medium and buildable, and a small amount greatly covers any type of imperfection. Finally, this concealer works very good on minimizing the appearance of fine lines, dark circles, redness, and discoloration without creasing. Overall, I highly recommend this product, complimentary from Rose Inc."

I had very low hopes that it wouldnu2019t yield the same result as other concealers Iu2019ve used and I was so wrong. I applied the concealer at 11 am and it lasted till midnight without looking cakey or dry or settling into my creases. I was shocked. I honestly even forgot to use under eye cream that morning. The color is a perfect match for my skin tone which is extremely rare due to my olive undertones. I highly recommend this concealer and I will be purchasing it once I empty this bottle.

It spreads and blends really well and provides a skin-like finish that leans slightly luminous. I do need to set it but I set all my concealers.

I thought it would be cakey and make my skin dry but it didnt. It left my skin soft and went on smooth. I also loved how long it lasted under my makeup. I would definitely recommend."

The wand was also soft when applying it directly to the skin. I received this product complimentary from Rose Inc."
