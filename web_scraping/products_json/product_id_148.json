What a huge disappointment. The color is so different from what's shown in the photos it almost feels fraudulent. It's extremely sheer, doesn't blend at all (even with a good primer) and creases horribly. It's more like a very sheer highlighter but it's too thick and smudgy to even use for that. I don't know if mine was expired or tainted in some way, but I will never purchase again. The two colors in the mini duo set are fantastic. But the full-sized incandescent is so bad it's not even funny. Why would I spend $35 on a product that looks nothing like the photos? I mean what the actual heck? Do better Bobbi Brown. Stuff like this makes loyal customers lose trust in your brand."
