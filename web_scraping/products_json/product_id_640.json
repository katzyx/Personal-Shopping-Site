There is a vanilla scent while wet, but once dried, theres no scent at all. Now that I found this lipstick, I am someone who wears lipstick every day."

Its been a bit hard to wear bc of that. Also it wears funky. Im sure it would wear better without anything overtop or underneath but I havent figured out a way to do that where it looks good.

That didn't really bother me as much as the scent - it's smells a bit like caramel and is quite cloying and it lingered to the point where I just couldn't wear the lipstick. If you're sensitive to fragrance, this is something to be aware of. I have a few of the bullet lipsticks with the same scent but find that it dissipates quickly."

However, this one definitely is not on that list. First and foremost, the consistency of this lipstick feels super sticky and rough upon application. No matter how I applied this (i.e., on dry lips, damp, and moisturized) it went all the same, and it felt like chalk. It highlighted cracks and crevices on my lips that I certainly did not need to be highlighted.   I do have to admit, that the color itself is a beautiful shade IF it would last. I only had this lipstick on for about an hour before drinking and it almost entirely wiped away the color. This was surprising to me, especially being a shade of red (isn't red one of the most difficult shades to take off?!). For the price, quality, and description, this just isn't worth it to me. If you're looking for a matte lipstick that is hydrating, long-lasting, and gives a beautiful color payoff, this just isn't it. This review was collected as part of a promotion."

When I apply it by its own, the lip gross makes my lips look glossy, but not too much. I also feel some hydration. It covers my lips without making even tiny wrinkles visible. Thats why I also add it to other matte lipsticks, which have this problem. Only one thing made me a little sad. If to apply as a single product, it doesnt last long, I need to renew it every hour or about that. Yes, I still feel it on my lips, but it becomes more invisible and I want it to be with me a little longer. And its not matte to me, a little glossy, but not matte."

The application process is a dream; it glides on like a lip gloss, providing that initial smooth, hydrating feel before drying down to a sophisticated matte finish. This liquid lipstick does have a bit more transfer compared to the matte lipsticks in the line, but it's still quite minimal, which is a big plus for long-lasting wear.  The shade I tried, Original Recipe, is a deep, rich red that is simply stunning. Im not usually one to gravitate towards dramatic lip colors, but this shade completely won me over. Its bold and it adds a touch of glam to any look.  Overall, the GXVE liquid lipstick is a standout product. Its combination of easy application, beautiful color payoff, and long-wearing matte finish makes it a must-have for anyone looking to elevate their lip game. Whether you're a fan of bold reds or just looking for a reliable matte liquid lipstick, this one is definitely worth a try.  This review was collected as part of a promotion."

As a beauty enthusiast who loves a good matte liquid lipstick, I was disappointed by the formula. While the color payoff is initially intense and bold, the product dries down to an uncomfortable, almost chalky texture on my lips.  The lipstick felt excessively drying, and within a few hours, it started to flake and crumble, leaving my lips looking uneven and patchy. Reapplying only made it worse, as the formula didnt layer well, leading to even more flakiness and discomfort. Despite being marketed as longwear, it didnt hold up through eating or drinking, and I found myself needing to reapply frequently, which is frustrating for a product that promises durability.  Additionally, the applicator made it difficult to achieve a precise line, and the formula tended to feather at the edges, requiring extra effort to clean up. While I appreciate the clean beauty aspect, the performance didnt live up to the hype, and I wouldnt recommend this product if youre looking for a reliable, comfortable matte liquid lipstick."

            "review_text": "As a longtime Gwen Stefani fan Ive always been impressed by her ability to create the perfect red shades and the Im Still Here High-Performance Matte Liquid Lipstick is no exception! This lipstick delivers an intense, opaque color with just a small amount of product. The initial application feels velvety and smooth, and the formula dries down gradually, which gives you an appropriate amount of time to perfect your application before it sets. Once dry the lipstick remains comfortable on the lips with its lightweight texture making it a pleasure to wear.   One of the highlights is its subtle vanilla scent which adds a touch of sweetness without being overpowering. While the lipstick is long-lasting it doesnt quite hold up as well as some of Gwen's other regular lipsticks and can sometimes flake a bit after re-application. Despite this minor drawback I still find it to be a fantastic product!  I highly recommend the Im Still Here High-Performance Matte Liquid Lipstick especially if youre a fan of rich, red shades and a lightweight formula. Just be sure to keep it handy for any necessary touch-ups to maintain that flawless look throughout the day!!"

That is really saying something too because a lot of times matte lipsticks can be crusty or dry funky in my opinion, they just don't always feel nice or look nice.  However, going along with that I felt like that particular shade Original Recipe, didn't look all that matte on the lips so maybe that has something to do with it.  I was a bit disappointed considering it's marketed as a matte lipstick, so I definitely had to knock it down a couple stars.  I really wish it was matte.  Original Recipe is a very true red and it is so, so bright.  You will be the star of the show anywhere you go if you've got this on your lips!  I really like the packaging of this product, it looks pretty sleek. I especially like that you can see the shade so well through the packaging."

The lipstick itself is an intense matte red that reminds me of cherry, a shade that stands out for its depth and elegance. Upon application, the scent is one of the first things you'll notice. The lipstick smells delicious, offering a sensory experience that goes beyond the simple act of applying makeup, for me this is a great detail as it turns the application into a pleasurable moment, and I love that subtle scent.  In terms of application, the product dries quickly, which is a plus for those looking for an efficient makeup routine. The matte texture, once set, provides a flawless and modern finish. However, it is important to mention that, although the color is visually appealing, over time the lips could feel a bit dry. This for me is an aspect to consider, especially if you plan to wear it for long periods.  The durability of the lipstick is great, it maintains its intensity and color for several hours, which is ideal for everyday use or for special events. However, there is another small downside: if you decide to touch up the product after a while, the color may start to appear in patches. It's something to keep in mind if you want to maintain a uniform look all day long maybe this lipstick is not for you. This review was collected as part of a promotion"

As someone who loves a bold red lip, I was excited to try this product. The lipstick goes on smoothly and dries to a comfortable, matte finish that doesnt feel drying or cakey, which is a huge plus for a liquid lipstick. The staying power is impressive, lasting through meals and drinks with minimal touch-ups needed.  However, I found the shade to be more of an orangey-red than I expected. While its still a striking color, I personally prefer a blue-red, which complements my skin tone better. The orangey undertone of this shade didnt flatter my complexion as much as I had hoped. That being said, the color is vibrant and would likely be stunning on someone with a warmer undertone.  Overall, this lipstick is a great addition to any collection if youre looking for a bright, matte red. I just wish the shade leaned more towards a classic blue-red. Nonetheless, the quality of the formula is undeniable, and I still reach for it when Im in the mood for a bold lip."

Speaking truly to the products, Ive found her traditional lipsticks and the highlighter palettes to be super high quality for the reasonable price point and fun to use, not to mention aesthetically pleasing in packaging. This liquid lipstick definitely follows that trend! I really love the bottle this is in and how hyper pigmented the color is. However, after years of giving liquid lipsticks a try Ive just found theyre not for me. They are over drying for the most part and its so easy for them to bleed into skin. I think if I got more consistent with lip liner Id enjoy it more but its just not my favorite. To be objective-this isnt any more drying than any other liquid lipstick I have used!

I LOVE it but know it's an issue for some folk. It's also quite drying. For the best payoff, it's recommended to apply to 100% dry lips but as the formula is drying, I really don't recommend it if your lips are dry/crusty.

Products promising longevity, pigment, and comfort are plentiful, yet few deliver on all fronts. However, GXVE by Gwen Stefanis Im Still Here High-Performance Matte Liquid Lipstick breaks the mold, offering an exceptional balance of performance and wearability. As a cosmetologist constantly on the lookout for standout products, I find this lipstick to be a noteworthy addition to any makeup collection. Here's why.   The texture of Im Still Here is remarkably smooth for a matte liquid lipstick. Its application is effortless, gliding over the lips with a lightweight feel that defies the expectation of a matte finish. The formula dries quickly, leaving a velvety finish that doesn't flake or cake.  One of the most impressive aspects of this lipstick is its staying power. It lives up to its name, remaining vibrant and intact through meals and daily wear, which is a considerable feat for a matte liquid lipstick. Unlike many long-lasting formulas, Im Still Here does not sacrifice comfort for durability. It maintains a flexible feel on the lips, avoiding the tightness or dryness often associated with matte products.  The pigmentation of GXVEs Im Still Here Matte Liquid Lipstick is rich and vivid, offering opaque coverage in a single swipe. The color payoff is impressive, providing a bold and uniform appearance that enhances the lips beautifully. This high level of pigmentation also means that the product can be used sparingly, extending its lifespan and offering greater value.  The versatility of the shades ensures that there's something for everyone, whether you're looking for a subtle enhancement or a dramatic statement.  GXVEs Im Still Here High-Performance Matte Liquid Lipstick stands out in the crowded market of matte lip products for several compelling reasons. Its unparalleled blend of long-lasting wear, comfort, and intense pigmentation sets a new sta"

I was beyond excited to be able to try out Im Still Here High-Performance Matte Liquid Lipstick. I am pretty shocked at how smooth this lipstick glides on and how easy the application is. It feels velvety at first and slowly dries down giving me enough time to fix any mistakes before it dries down. I just love how buttery it feels when applying I dont even know how to explain it properly. I do not think it lasts as long as others which is a bummer. I dont agree with it being transfer proof though. It did flake up after re application on my every once in a while as well but overall a great lipstick!"

Even my husband, who's heard about my makeup infatuation for over 20 years now has said that he loves these shades.

The colors are so gorgeous, perfect on any beauty skin tone and I love how clean the formulas are. So far I've been very impressed and happy with all GXVE makeup products. At times I've had allergic reactions to lipsticks. Unfortunately as l've gotten older I've developed sensitive skin. But these babies are great!!!"

I'm not huge on matte liquid lipsticks these days but I like both of these shades a lot. The muted shade flannel and formula of both does remind me of the matte liquid lipstick trend of 2016-2018. Both shades are pretty and very rich in pigment but definitely felt dry on the lips. It's not the most dry liquid lip formula I've ever experienced but it did honestly feel pretty heavy. I noticed the more layers of product you apply the heavier and dryer the product will feel on the lip. On a dryness scale of 1-10 I'd give them around a 7. I noticed transfering with both shades especially around the edges. It's not kiss proof (or beverage proof) but they are pretty shades and it does last longer on the lip than a typical bullet lipstick. I prefer a smaller doe foot applicator than these larger ones these have because they made it difficult to expertly apply crisp clean lines. Both shades were quite hard for me to remove and the removal process was messy. I used a micellar makeup wipe for shade flannel and it did not cut it at all, even with the help of a lip scrub. I had to grab a damp makeup eraser cloth to really get it off the remaining product off after really working overtime with the makeup wipe and lip scrub. I noticed a little bit of a blue tint left over on my lips after I took off shade flannel but nothing too intense. Shade original recipe basically did not budge with the micellar wipe so this time I went in with organic coconut oil. I used the coconut oil like a cleaning balm to remove it. This was the quickest way to remove it though the process was still pretty messy. Overall I'd say these are lovely shades but I wouldn't recommend them for events or everyday use obecause they transfer when you eat/drink/kiss/etc. and they are not very comfortable on the lip.

It is easy to apply, it took about 3 minutes for it to not feel tacky and it stayed on until I ate and drank and then I needed to reapply. I used moisturizer on my lips first if they were dry in the am, then applied the lipstick, and it is truly long wear, didnt need to reapply until after eating.  It gave my lips a nice smooth matte finish, I didnt notice any cracking.  My favorite color is Flannel, for a natural effect for day wear."

I love how this liquid lipstick gave me some room to make sure the lines were clean before it dried down. Once the lipstick dried, it appeared matte and really wore true to a lipstick! The color maintained as I ate my dinner and beside one touch-up, lasted all night! I also received some compliments on my lip color, which was nice since it seems to look good on cool light skintones like mine!

Ive been a Gwen Stefani fan for decades and have always adored her classic, true red lip against her very tan skin and platinum blonde hair. I think the contrast of the bright red against the very light features always looks good. Lipstick always makes me feel prettier, dressier and more confident.  Im Still Here Lightweight Longwear Matte Liquid Lipstick is truly unique. The packaging is beautifully and it comes with a lot of product for a good price. You truly only need one swipe. Less is more. I typically like to wear lipliners with lipsticks but that isnt necessary! The application tip turned on its side makes for a thinner tip that is easier to apply and make sure you dont get lipstick anywhere you dont want it. I am so impressed and amazed that my lips dont feel extra dry and arent visibly flaking and cracking. It almost feels like nothing is on my lips at all!"

I love the color Flannel it's exactly the color I'm always looking for. A nude that's dark enough to scream sexy even when I'm not trying! The container feels good in my hand, with exact edges and heavy duty acrylic. This lipstick and it's container is gorgeous and extravagant. Completely on par with Gwen Stefani's look and style.

This liquid lippy wears beautifully. It dries down to an almost velvet like feel without drying my lips out. The color pay out is insane after just one application. No streaks! No feathering! It is very transfer resistant. And it taste like vanilla frosting in the best way.  I wore mine for and entire six hour shift and did not need to reapply. It didn't transfer on my coffee cup or my husband's cheek. It's a powerhouse of a lipstick. I also love the bigger applicator which makes applying a breeze.   Cruelty free and vegan are important to me so I was thrilled to see this lippy is both as well as being a clean product. It just hits all the marks. It made a matte believer out of me.   Flannel is my personal favorite color, it a mauvy color that reminds me of a rainy fall morning curled up with a book looking out of a window. Just relaxing. I love it so much.

I was nervous when I finally had to do a touch up because I thought it would flake or get nasty but it reapplied smoothly and gave me no issues whatsoever. Very pigment for sure and the scent is amazing. Reminded me of a candy I use to eat as a little girl."

The application process was a breeze. The lipstick glided on smoothly, leaving a rich layer of color that quickly set to a beautiful ultra-matte finish. The fear of liquid lipstick being drying was quickly dispelled as this formula felt surprisingly comfortable on the lips, without the tightness or dryness often associated with matte finishes.The real test, however, was its longevity and resistance to transferring. To say I was impressed would be an understatement. It lived up to its mask-proof claim, surviving not just my coffee test but also a long day of wear without fading, feathering, or transferring. GXVE offers a variety of shades, from Gwens iconic reds to versatile nudes and brights, catering to different moods and occasions. Its a product that not only looks good but feels good to use, aligning with ethical beauty standards. The GXVE I'm Still Here High-Performance Matte Liquid Lipstick has truly set a new standard for what I expect from liquid lipsticks.

I wore this for a special event and a date night, I was truly impressed with how long the color stays on. It takes a lot of rubbing off with my micellar water and face cleanser for the red to come off completely. Original Recipe is a beautiful shade of red, I would highly consider this color and formula for a bride-to-be. It is a liquid lipstick and I expected this to feel slightly drying, but I do use a lip conditioner underneath to help prevent too much lip chapping. The only reason I find myself refraining from using lip gloss over this is simply because that might reduce its staying power. I highly recommend this liquid lipstick for anyone who wants to try, the color range is a variety of shades that will fit most preferences."

Now to the product, the wand is perfect for precise lining. Second, first lip application was so smooth and felt amazing on my lips. Once dried, the finish was matte but not stiff. My lips were able to move, talk and laugh. Tested also the longevity, lets just say it went above and beyond. No reapplication needed at all, stayed on even when I was drinking water and eating. I enjoyed a burger and it did not transfer to my chin. That has always been an issue with reds. Not with this one. Love this red lipstick, and will be my go to for all my bold going out looks."

Today I wanted to talk about GXVE beauties I am still here lightweight long wear matte liquid lipstick. I am going to start by saying that I do not typically like a liquid lipstick/lip stain because I have found with my hyper sensitive lips that the formulas tend to irritate and dry out my lips. This particular liquid lipstick however made my lips feel like they had nothing on. This gave me the most gorgeous color without all of the negative side effects I have experienced in the past. The smell is wonderful and it only took one dip with this doe foot for the perfect application. The color doesnt transfer once it dries on your lips so it honestly is like you have nothing on. This is my new favorite Matt lippy."

Im not a huge fan of this red, the Im Still Here Original Recipe. I did notice that it does bleed after some time and doesnt stay put. If you use lipliner it helps with the bleeding but if you want something to throw on quick to spice up your look, I wouldnt recommend this color lipstick from this line. Ive had better luck with a different color but for some reason this specific color in the GXVE line isnt my favorite. So on to some good feedback, I like how it applies nice and easy. The applicator is like a soft felt wand brush which is what I like. The packaging is very attractive and very well made. The lid wont slip off in your purse and the sturdy plastic will never crack or break. I love the names chosen for this product line. So all in all if youre a red lipstick girl, this may not be best for you."

Having previously owned the signature shade, Original Recipe, I already knew I was in for a treat with the quality of GXVE lipsticks. The shade Flannel, however, took my breath away. It's absolutely beautiful dusty mauve and adds a touch of elegance to any look.  What sets this matte liquid lipstick apart is not just its stunning color range but also its incredible comfort on the lips. The formula feels weightless, and I can wear it all day without any discomfort. It's the perfect balance between a matte finish and a comfortable wear, which is a rare find in the world of matte lipsticks.  One of the standout features for me is its long-lasting power. The lipstick is truly budge-proof and stays put even after hours of wear. I especially appreciate that it's mask-proof, ensuring that the color remains vibrant without any transfer or feathering.  The clean beauty aspect of GXVE products is another reason why I'm a fan. Knowing that the formula is vegan, cruelty-free, and free from harmful ingredients adds to the overall appeal of the product. It's not just a lipstick; it's a clean and conscious choice for my beauty routine.  In conclusion, if you're in search of a high-performance matte liquid lipstick that combines long-lasting color, comfort, and clean beauty, look no further than GXVE Beauty's I'm Still Here. The shade Flannel has won me over, and I'm excited to explore more colors in this fantastic collection."

The first thing i noticed when i applied this lipstick was how sticky it was, its not the end of the world but in order to take that sensation away i needed to put a lip gloss over which kind of killed the point of it being matte. Speaking of matte this lipstick did not dry down to what i consider a matte. To me matte is flat, it might even make your lips appear dry if you didnt prime them. This lipstick still kept a shine when i used it, i didnt apply alot, again, because the colors were so saturated. In all i wanted to try this brand because i was a big gwen stefani fan when i was younger. While the product isnt bad, it didnt wow me either"

The I'm Still Here High-Performance Matte Liquid Lipstick by GXVE (Gwen Stefanis new makeup line) is exactly what we all wanted. This liquid lipstick comes in a variety of shades and one of them, of course, is her iconic original red color (named The Original Recipe). this long wear formula goes on thick and almost dry feeling. You can tell right when you touch it to your lips that its there to stay for awhile (so be very, very careful). Once applied this formula dries down super fast and claims to be mask proof, which I wasnt able to test. I did however, wear this mat high-performance lipstick without a mask and was pleasantly surprised at its potency. Even though I noticed some color wearing off throughout the day on napkins, or Kleenexes, the overall looking color didnt really fade on my lips. I also noticed that it looked like it evenly wore off. There was no blotchiness or spots where color faded down. I totally recommend this flattering matte lipstick, to anyone looking for a super long lasting potent lip that looks elegant and bold."

I recently tried the I'm Still Here lightweight, long-wear matte lipstick in the color original recipe and it's stunning. The true red shade is beautiful and highly pigmented. Once dried, it feels weightless, doesn't transfer, and doesn't bleed into fine lines. Surprisingly, I opted to skip the lip pencil, and the application was precise without it. The substantial and well-designed packaging adds to the overall appeal u2013 it feels great in the hand and is a joy to take out of your handbag."

Love the Matte Liquid Lipstick by GXVE. It is highly pigmented bold clean color. These lip colors really match their swabs and dont fade!

She is the perfect mix of rebel punk rockstar meets glamorous beauty like me. When I heard of GXVE Beauty, I jumped at the chance to try it for myself. The GXVE Im Still Here Lightweight Longwear Matte Liquid Lipstick has a unique formulation for a lipstick. Im so used to using a stick of lipstick that has a matte finish. This lipstick has a creamy, liquid lipstick, lipgloss texture, yet its not shiny like a lipgloss. Its tube is clear with black and white letters and it has a golden lid. It even has a doe foot applicator. I like to use the shiny, golden mirror like lid of this tube as a mini cosmetic mirror to help me apply this lipstick to my lips. It comes in a box that is a light brown color and has a fun red and white design on the inside. I had the pleasure of trying both the Flannel and Original Recipe shades. The Flannel shade is a beautiful dusty rose. I love its brownish, pink color. Original Recipe is a true red color and the perfect shade of red for me. It works so well with my fair skin. Its such a beautiful pop of color. Its now my go to red lipstick. This is a longwear liquid lipstick. I love how long the color lasts. It has a beautiful gourmand vanilla frosting scent and flavor. It takes me back to the scents of lipglosses I used in the early 2000s. I would recommend this to any rebellious rockstar in their teens and older looking for a matte,liquid lipstick that will provide your lips with a beautiful, creamy, hydrating formulation that wont budge and has a long lasting bold color."

It has a really light sweet scent, which I personally enjoy. It glides onto the lips very easily. This matte lipstick holds a slight shine even after it dries. The doesnt feel heavy or tacky on the lips. It stays on for about 2 hours before I need reapply. My main complaint is that its shiny even after it dries. Both shades were like this! If youre a fan of Gwen, and you dont mind a shinier matte lipstick, you would probably love this but it just wouldnt be my go-to product since I prefer a more matte look."

After blending, the color is even and highly pigmented. It gives you a matte finish. And I love that its mask proof, no fading, feathering, or transferring. You can create different looks with just one lipstick, if you put a little bit and blend it out, the color would be natural and good for everyday use. If you want it bold, just apply it all over your lips, it would be good for any special night event."

However, the formula of this product comes in a sassy, chic tube with a soft doe applicator so I can control the amount of color I want to add to my pout. This lipstick lives by its name as it is very lightweight and long-lasting, although I can remove it with some micellar wateru2026takes it off quickly.  This product delivers a phenomenal range of shades, but the one that stands out for me is the Original Recipeu201d which is Gwen Stefanis signature red that I love. She mastered the perfect bright red that is compatible with several skin tones. It is a significant red to wear dailyu2026it gives my pout the glamorous feel I am asking for. The first time I wore this lip product, I received numerous compliments for the beautiful red shade. Also, the application is it goes creamy but will dry into a bold matte. There will be no need to layer it as it is highly pigmented enough to apply one swipe onto the lips. It stays in place throughout my long days (drinking and eating) until I need to remove it at night. I know when I am wearing a matte lip, I forget that I have it on until I catch a look in the mirror, pleased by how intact the color still appears. Now, that is a good lipstick. It is not heavy, not tacky, no fading, no feathering, and comfortable to wear daily. I see this product as a game-changer and a must-have in lip products."

I have medium olive skin and Anastasia and KVD's new formula mauve colors are just too light, and other brands are just not the right shade of mauve (like the Huda beauty which also takes forever to dry and gets everywhere like lipgloss until then).   But finally, cowgirl is absolutely perfect for medium tan olive skin! and its soo perfectly matte and dries right away without drying the lips or looking flaky or blotchy. Its so silky looking and when I touch it with my finger, absolutely nothing is transferred. I havent tried with food but I have a feeling that it will stay on even after eating. I am sooooo happy!!! I never thought a musician would make amazing makeup but then again Gwen Stefani was always the queen of the red lips so it makes sense"

This smells like if you left butter out for too long and mixed sugar in with it. I can't get past the scent when putting it on it that strong. Next, I'd say this makes your lips look dried out even if they don't feel it. The color I got was cowgirl, and it was pretty when putting it on, but when it dried... it was dark plum almost on me. I wear mauve lipstick mostly, and this wasn't mauve to me. The only thing about this lipstick I love is the staying power i wore it while drinking and eating, and it lasted. I gave it 2 stars for that, but overall, I probably won't buy this again."

I ate salad with a balsamic dressing   (oily!). I ate meatballs and corn fritters, and drank Thai iced tea and ginger beer for dinner. I went to a show until about 11:30pm. I DID NOT RE-APPLY ONCE. Yes, by the end of that day, it was drying. It had worn off a little on the inside my lips, and bled just a tiny bit on the edges (again -- no liner). But other than that, it looked amazing. I'd say 8/10 status after over TWELVE hours, including two real meals."

It dries down to a very comfortable ultra matte finish that doesn't crack or feel tight or drying on my lips, and it stays put for hours even through drinking and eating.  In my opinion, what sets this liquid lipstick apart from others is its longevity and the fact that it really is transfer and smudge proof on top of it, maintaining its vibrant color all day. Overall, this is one of the best stand-out liquid matte lipsticks I've tried as the formula is super long-lasting, and the color is just so beautiful and vibrant.

The shade flannel is like a Rosie taupe that compliments every skin tone I love how long wearing this formula is and gives you time to work with it before it dries down to a beautiful matte finish. I also appreciate how long wearing this liquid lipstick is even after I eat it still stays in place. Most liquid lipsticks are not comfortable to wear, but I appreciate this one because it feels super comfortable and lightweight on the lips. This is such the perfect fall lipstick and I would recommend this to anyone that is looking for a comfortable high pigment matte liquid lip"

First and foremost, the sweet rose flavor and scent are simply delightful. It adds a subtle, pleasant touch to the application process that I genuinely look forward to each time I use it.  One of the standout features of this lipstick is its lightweight formula. It glides on effortlessly, and you barely feel like you're wearing lipstick at all. This is particularly important for me when I'm on the go, such as when I'm picking up my baby from daycare. I need a lipstick that's comfortable and long-lasting, and this one certainly fits the bill.  The matte finish of the GXVE Tomboy lipstick is spot-on. It offers a velvety, non-shiny look that's perfect for both casual and more formal occasions. I've found that it stays put for hours without the need for constant touch-ups, which is a big plus for busy moms like myself.  What I really appreciate is how easily it applies. The lipstick's design allows for precise application without the need for a lip liner. The color payoff is fantastic, and it gives my lips a beautifully defined and even look.   Another fantastic aspect of this lipstick is its versatility. The shade seems to complement a wide range of skin tones, making it suitable for many different people. It's become my go-to choice for both everyday wear and special occasions.  Perhaps the best part is the compliments I receive when wearing this lipstick. It seems to be universally appealing, and I often get asked what I'm wearing. It's a fantastic confidence boost to know that this lipstick not only looks great but also draws positive attention."

STUNNING!Especially now with fall coming its perfection. As for flaking I found if I lined my lips with a lipliner,the liner is what started flaking not the liquid lip.Mine lasted all day with eating and drinking.The only time it started wearing off was if I ate a salad or anything  with oil.If that happened I just started all over again. I found that if I reapplied over my old lipstick thats when I could have a problem.If you had to reapply I would apply it to the centre of the lip.I probably lost some of you. Sorry ud83dude1e What I really wanted to say is  was I love them so much that I ordered a new batch of all three colours.   I have not tried any of the other colours.Make sure your lips are well taken care of. Dont use a balm underneath or a gloss on top. That just changes the product.This is a matte lipstick ud83dudc84 The clients that Ive used them on loved them and how it made their. lips look.I ordered new ones for my professional kit as well.

I'm not usually a fan of liquid lipsticks because of how drying they can be, but recent formulations seem to be less drying, including the ones from the GXVE I'm Still Here range. Flannel is my third lipstick from this line; the first I received as gratis and the second & this third I purchased myself based on how well the first one performed. This is my honest and authentic opinion, as a Sephora Beauty Insider Community Ambassador.  WHAT I LIKE: * The shade Flannel is my favorite of this series - it's a pigmented, slightly deeper and bolder my-lips-but-better shade * Color is vibrant and rich * Lightweight feel * No need for a lip liner * Dries down quickly & wears comfortably, for the most part (but, as to be expected from a liquid lipstick, it is drying but not nearly as drying as other formulations) * Longwearing (but see below) - this holds up for most of the day, longer if I'm very careful about eating and limit my drinks during the day.  * Leaves a pretty stain to the lips as it wears down  AREA(S) FOR IMPROVEMENT: * It claims to be transfer-proof, but it is not. It will transfer onto cups, silverware, etc. The most transfer-proof shade in this group is Original Recipe. The other colors I've tried transfer much more easily and quickly.    FYI: * Full coverage * Matte finish (but doesn't feel too drying on the lips) * The shade Flanne is a gorgeous, slightly smoky rose-and-mauve my-lips-but-better shade.  * Of all her lipstick lines, this one is the standout for me. I'm not typically a liquid lipstick wearing gal but the ones in the I'm Still Here collection stand out to me for their formulation (not as drying as other liquid lipsticks) and wearability.  * Vegan * Cruelty-free  BUY, BUY, BUY ud83dudecd or BYE-BYE ud83dudc4b?:  * Even though it's not completely transfer-proof, it does have a good staying power and is one of the more comfortable liquid lipsticks I've worn. A BUY, BUY, BUY ud83dudecd for me."

AREA(S) FOR IMPROVEMENT: * The shade Original Recipe lived up to its transfer proof claims. This shade Cowgirl, did not. Would like to see more consistency with the transfer proof claims. That said, even though Cowgirl did transfer, it didn't wear off completely.

My only complaint is the smell -  its like cake batter - and while nostalgia is part of the line, Easy Bake Oven is over the top for me.  Also - Fishnets is underrated -  its equal parts bright and deep, which is a hard for a balance for a liquid lip color to strike and it leans red, not pink.  Its a one note color but I'm glad to have it in my collection. especially at this price point.  I wear it more than I thought I would."

This is my honest and authentic opinion as a Sephora Beauty Insider Community Ambassador.   Original Me, a blue-based red in the Im Still liquid lipstick line is stunning - a true neutral red that seems to flatter many, many complexions. Reds give me some pause as I often find them turning fuschia on my lips. Not so with this beauty from GXVE by Gwen Stefani. This one goes on red and stays red. It also stays put. Through a 20-minute walk to and from the coffee shop with my Covid mask on; a ramen meal; and multiple glasses of water. It also wears comfortably and does not leave my lips feeling dry. A downside for me at least, is that it can bleed a little upon application and I find I need to use a lip liner. Other than that (and thats a minor downside), this is really a perfect red liquid lipstick."

I love the colour, its the perfect shade of red and I feel it would look gorgeous on all skin tones however, almost right away, I noticed it was coming off when I took a sip of water and then it started to feather at the edges within a couple hours! It does not hold up with eating and drinking, it continued to come off on everything so I tried to reapply it and let it dry again. I put a mask on today and went about my business for the day, the second photo is what my lips looked like after taking my mask off. For a product that claims to be long wearing and budge proof, this did not hold true to its claims at all for me unfortunately:( and then it got crumbly and dry after a period of time.  I wear the Kylie liquid lips and have never had a problem, you can eat, drink, wear a mask if you are a mask wearer, go about your business without any issues and it doesnt feel like there is anything on your lips! For all the makeup I have purchased and tried (which is a lot!!!), I have never really felt compelled to review a product (even the great ones- I just continue to repurchase!) but I was honestly just shocked that this product claims to do all those things and it doesnt do a single one other then colour pay off! Others may have luck, but I wouldnt suggest this product at all unfortunately :("

At first the color goes on creamy and smooth, very glossy, but you better slather it on fast because it dries so quickly. Once it dries, it is very patchy and crumbly. Feels very dry and not very comfortable on the lips at all. It is not worth $24. There are more affordable brands out there with better formulas."

Im in love with the liquid lipstick - I can line my lips precisely with the applicator and the perimeter stays sharp even after a meal. There is some fragrance to it when I pull the applicator from the tube, but after I apply it on my lips, the scent fades away completely and does not bother me at all. This is an awesome true red, comparable to the beloved SC 01 Always Red. Its the type of red that will make your teeth appear whiter. I think you will enjoy this if you like the hold of a liquid lipstick without the dryness. It feels weightless and comfortable on the lips. There is some transfer, but minimal."

I was SOOOOO excited to get her lipstick and so far had only heard good things. Sadly this just doesnt live up to the hype. The color is very nice, the smell is a pleasant, cake-like scent thats not too overpowering and mostly goes away once applied. I love that its vegan and cruelty free. That being said, this is NOT long wearing/lasting and is definitely NOT transfer proof. So far Im 5 hours into the day (WITH LIPLINER) And I already look all smudged/clownish. This bleeds and feathers very easily and its also SOOOOO drying. Im sad because I wanted to love it but maybe Ill exchange this for the matte lipstick instead because this is just not it. Id recommend Fentys liquid lipstick or KVD instead."

Rich, blazing bright blue-red. And yet, it somehow does not look out of place on my lips. The vanilla cake-batter scent is quite noticeable at first, although it quickly disappears once applied. The doe foot applicator is precise enough to allow me to go without liner, gliding on accurately and smoothly. Although it appears shiny and feels feathery soft at first, it quickly dries down. Once dry, it left my lips feeling slightly tacky. I could u2018feel it on my lips, and although it was not bothersome at first, I was not a fan of the dryness.  Two hours after applying, I checked the mirror to find everything still in place; no feathering. I had smudged a bit to the side from wearing a mask for a few minutes, which was quickly wiped off. I reapplied and within 10 minutes, my lips felt so uncomfortable from the settling of the product that I removed it. Despite the transfer to my cheek (and glass straw), it took some work to coax it off of my lips with micellar water.  Would I recommend? That depends. Im Still Here has great longevity and the shade seems to be universally flattering. If liquid matte lips are your thing, if you arent afraid of color, and you want a product that performs, then I would say yes. However, if they arent, good news! The line has two additional reds in satin and matte traditional bullet form that might be more appealing and wear more comfortably."

I'm 41 and grew up listening to No Doubt (back when they made good music) and always wanted the ruby red lips Gwen sported. So when I saw this...?!?! I was practically giddy. I love makeup but when it comes to lipstick I HAVE to have a true long wear. The best for me, is Covergirls Outlast which doesn't dry out my lips and literally wears all day. it's amazing. So before buying this, I asked how this compared strictly in regards to long wear/non transferability. the answers I received were about the same. each said it lasted all day. was put on before work and lasted thru meals and still looked good 10 hours later. YES! I couldn't order it fast enough. So today was the day I got my soon to be best friend. I ran to the bathroom, took the lipstick out of the box, and smiled as I started to unscrew the golden cap. I was a little surprised, when I started pulling the lipstick out, at the quasi fruity and not in a good way, yet oddly familiar smell. *In the hunt for the perfect lipstick, I've tried a lot! of different brands...including my most recent purchase...from dollar general! made by Maybelline. It's called Sensational Liquid Matte. It smells exactly the same, but actually held up as opposed to Gwen's, and cost me 5 bucks I think. Anywho, I started to apply the lipstick and almost immediately the smell went away, so that was a plus. Just as described, this lipstick feels weightless, and is packed with high payoff color that felt really nice and not dry on my lips. I blotted (just a light lip mark on the tissue, otherwise it was all still fully saturated on my lips). i was pretty happy at the match with my skintone. so I left for dinner. let's just say the whole, non transferable, budgeproof, no feathering, whatever other longwear claims that were made...didnt ring true for me. I used the bathroom after dinner and was embarrassed at my lips! see pic below. literally..."

After a few hours, it bled above the lip line and around the corners of my mouth. It is not transfer proof and will come off onto your hand or a napkin if you touch your lips. I personally dont mind the smell, but compare it to the Huda liquid lips. If you dont like that scent I dont think youll like this. I did like the weight and look / feel of the packaging but the formula needs work in my opinion."

I usually stay away from liquid lipsticks as I find them really drying on the lips.  This one surprised me at how comfortable it was to wear.  I didnt feel my lips dry while wearing it at all.  I could easily wear it for hours without wanting to take it off.  Bonus that it held up well throughout the day without having to constantly touch it up.  The color is the most beautiful vibrant red lipstick that I have ever owned that looks perfect on my skin tone.  Although, it states it is a matte liquid lipstick, I felt it dried down to a semi matte since there is a sheen to it but not glossy.  I did pair it with PMG lip liner in Blood Lust but honestly felt that you didnt need a lip liner at all.  The applicator made it so easy for you to outline your lips and fill in.  Even though it states it is budge proof, I did find it to transfer a bit but had great staying power.  A drawback for some would be that it is scented but it didnt bother me.  I am hoping Gwen adds more colors in this line because her liquid lipstick so far is amazing and the packaging is so on point with the brand."

I had worn my hair down and was caught in a gust of wind where my hair blew across my lips and I was embarrassed to find bold red lines where my hair dragged across my face.

I wore it to lunch and when I noticed it was getting on my hands, I tried to wipe it off and it was everywhere.  My husband looked at me and asked if my lips were bleeding.  I used a cheap balm to rehydrate my lips (thats another problem: very drying), then I was able to wipe it off completely.  Again, its great for pictures but Id never leave my house again while wearing."

The only downside (and why I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars was the smell. It was sweet, almost like fake cake batter, and VERY strong. Luckily, after 30min or so, the smell had gone, otherwise I don't think I could have worn it. (I will continue to wear it despite the smell, but would love to see that lessened in the future)"

For reference, I am 44 years old and have wrinkly aging lips.  I am including a picture of all red lipsticks I have at this point (I have an obsession, I knowu2026)  PROS: - I love that all the collection come in clean, modern, chic looking recycled cardboard boxes that have a gorgeous design inside. - It is a clean at Sephora brand, cruelty free, vegan, and with recyclable packaging. - The packaging is so beautiful! I find it elegant and chic. It is not too light but not heavy either. It closes with a click, not magnetic. - It is a liquid formula, that feels velvety upon application, and very comfortable on the lips. It was not sticky or tacky. It was not drying and it lasted the whole day looking gorgeous.  - It is long lasting but not fully transfer-proof. It did transfer to my cup so I can imagine that it would transfer to my mask, but it did it so slightly, so I can consider it u201cenough transfer-proofu201d. Thats why I find it so comfortable, because it is not fully dry, which all non-transfer formulas are. - It is highly pigmented. - It doesnt bleed into lip lines and wrinkles. - It has a small applicator that it is easy to use for more precision.  - I find it rightly priced for the quality. CONS: - As I said, it is NOT transfer-free. It will slightly transfer to cups, loved ones, masksu2026 - It is a scented lipstick. I dont mind perfumed formulas, in fact I like them, but I find this one a little too overwhelming for my liking, but I like the lipstick performance so much that this doesnt change my rating of the product. But if you dont like scented formulas, stay away from this one."

For someone who was inspired by her make up looks as a young girl (I loved her since No Doubt), sadly I was not impressed by this long wear clean matte lipstick.  First impressions: beautiful packaging, so Gwen. I love the black and white with pops of gold!  Opening the lipstick, the smell of it smells a little sweet.. not my favorite tbh. It also looks like it has a lipgloss applicator because its thick and the hairs on the brush stick out quite a bit (like a lip gloss applicator). Personally, I like something a little more stiff.  Color wise, the color is beautiful and sticks out a lot. This will be your bright brick red, than a deep universal red. Upon application: messy and thick, I really needed to work with my lip liner to help it look clean but it does bleed through and made it look choppy on the edges of lips after a while.  Longwear: I wore it to work, and about two hours in, it was already halfway off. Maybe from talking? Not sure but I had to reapply and when I did, the formula is just very very thick, I felt like my lips had chunks of dryness coming off. I wish I had an after picture because it was so chunky!  I will not be returning this product though, solely for the fact that its Gwen Stefani and I am a huge fan..  I will be trying the others, I have high hopes for those. Maybe just not on a day that Im going to work.  Will I recommend this product? No, to make up girls who KNOW what they like. But yes if youre a huge fan and want Gwens merch."

I did pre treat my lips with oil before applying it as my lips tend to get dry with liquid lipsticks in general so I knew to prep them well.   It does transfer.  It does stain my lips.  Upon removal my lips looked a sheer cherry red which looked wonderful with a clear coat of gloss over it.  You will definitely need a cleansing oil to remove it entirely.   I knocked off a star for it transferring (none of the liquid lipsticks I love dry down completely and Im fine with that but know this may be a deal breaker for some.

Pros *Absolutely beautiful shade of red, although it is more warm toned than the lipstick. *Applies evenly and you can use the tip of the doe foot applicator to line the lips  Cons *Never really dries down and become one with the lips *Transfers.  Not so much when I blotted with a tissue immediately after application, but it does come off on cups, etc. and it does smear.   Can be messy. *The color is a bit different than the lipstick- it is warmer (may not be a con, but worth mentioning) *The color wears off in a way typical of liquid lipsticks- in the center of the lips.  This was the biggest deal breaker for me.  I am sure there are better liquid lip formulas out there.  This was a miss for me."

Today is the first time I've used it but so far it seems to stay on well, even after I kissed my husband goodbye, he had zero traces on him. It hadn't made my lips feel dry which is a plus because most matte lips do even when they claim they don't. Even if it turns out to not last long I'm still gonna be happy because I'm a child and love the smell"

I would say it feels similar to the Fenty one and is just as comfortable, but unlike Fenty it does not transfer (Fenty is one of my favorites, dont get me wrong!). It has the staying power of KVD but isnt drying and it doesnt pill in the corners. It lasted all day under a humid mask in humid Florida while I worked and even after I ate. It did not feather, bleed, or transfer, and it stayed comfortable all day almost as if I had just applied it. I didnt even touch it up all day. I highly recommend this lipstick!

I hope the regular lipstick might be better, but I am going to wait a while to order (this was very pricey for my budget, but I treated myself for my birthday).  :-(   I will try it with a different applicator and see if it helps, I do not want to give up on it, yet!"

Its smells like cake batter and not all chemically like others I have tried. The color payload is so strong that I only need one simple swab, so it feels like I'm wearing nothing! Dries down well, and I only found it to transfer when eating or drinking. Hubby normally doesn't let me kiss him while wearing bright colors lipstick for fear of transfer, but he likes this one.

I also love the fact that it is clean which is a rare thing when it comes to liquid lipsticks. The only thing is that I wish the applicator wand was better.

It wears really comfortable, enough that I forgot I was even wearing it!   The only cons  I have for this is that it does transfer. I wore this for about 4 hours. I drank, ate, and kissed my loves and as you can see it transfers. The close up shows you what it looks like (after ~ 4 hours of wear) before I took it off for the night. You can see it wearing off some - so reapplying might be a good idea if youre out and about whining and dining for awhile."

I apply it by using the tip of the applicator to outline my lips and then fill in my lips next for the perfect pout. It is also buildable so if you want to apply a second layer just wait a maybe a minute for first to dry before applying second layer, but for me honestly its so pigmented one or two layers is all you need. This honestly is the perfect red lipstick and I believe to be universally flattering for everyone! I love that this brand is also a clean, cruelty free, and vegan brand so I feel good using it.

It is highly pigmented and stays on a long time. I love the container. Its very glam looking. I lined my lips first and then filled in the middle. Its a very vibrant red. I received several compliments.  Would recommend!"
