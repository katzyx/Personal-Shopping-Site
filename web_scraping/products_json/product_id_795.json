I don't care for the smokey scent of it,  I thought it would have smelled different, because I do normally like fig scented body care items.  It does have argan oil,  avocado oil, and shea butter, so it is greasy.  It takes a bit to get it all absorbed, but skin feels really moisturized after.  Since I don't care for the scent I have been using it on my feet, it's been great!  I do love the pouch style packaging which is great for my purse or travel bag."

Its compact packaging makes it convenient to toss into my purse ensuring that I always have nourishing moisture at my fingertips, wherever I go. Despite its small size, a little goes a long way, making this mini body butter surprisingly long-lasting.

Boasting an earthy scent, the Bohemian Fig fragrance is definitely unique and while I like the scent, I wish it was a bit less woody and a bit more warm and sweet. The body butter itself has a lusciously, creamy consistency and melts into the skin like a dream. It also contains shea butter and avocado oil in addition to the argan oil, so it not only moisturizes, but also provides antioxidant benefits, which also aids in helping firm the skin, improving elasticity and keeping skin soft and supple. You can also order refills for the jar, which I think is a fantastic option. I absolutely love the way my skin feels using this body butter, however I would likely choose a different scent next time."

This is the first time trying the Bohemian Fig scent and I'm in love. Since it's a natural scent, it is very subtle but still gives you this pure, refreshing fig tree note. I also love that the body butters can now be refilled - will definitely buying a refill for mine!"

I would say it smells better on the skin than in the jar and it can definitely be a scent for anyone. As soon as I put the cream on my skin, it felt silky smooth and melted right into my skin. It provides hydration and makes my skin glowy at the same time. The jar is so beautiful and looks great on my counter. I love the fact that itu2019s refillable and I can choose any scent!"

I think the packaging is fun and it's super easy to squirt out the right amount of lotion. The lotion itself is a dream- I love the whipped texture.
