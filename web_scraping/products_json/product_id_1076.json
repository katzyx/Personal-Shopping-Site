It's comparable in price to other well known perfumes too. My personal favorite is black opium, but having a variety of scents is nice.  I feel like a lot of women I know would like it too, so it's a nice gift to give!"

I've really only been able to find one signature fragrance which is fine, but sometimes you just want to mix it up. I was excited to try Marc Jacobs Daisy because of its notes. I has a light violet scent that is mild, but floral. It evokes a playful top note followed by a light airy base that lingers. It's not over the top and I get hints of it while running errands or walking around that bring a smile to my face. I'm prone to scent migraines and a huge plus for me is that this one doesn't cause headaches! I love how it's a casual scent, but also can be worn for dressier occasions and parties. The floral light airy scent is perfect for me. I hate gourmand scents and I find a lot of fragrances have that vanilla scent to them, which this does not so a huge win. Definitely a winner in my book and will be getting the full size."

I only sprayed on my left wrist in the morning once, and I was able to smell it on me until the evening of the same day. The scent, however, is the reason why I took off 1 star. I thought it would be very floral based on the packaging of the product and how the bottle looks on advertisement. To my surprised it was not floral, in my opinion. The scent is more of a clean and fresh scent that I think would be good for summer. Other than the scent not being what I was expecting, I think it's a good perfume since the scent stays on all day and doesn't change on me."

However, for those who prefer more subtle or sophisticated perfumes, the sweetness of Daisy can be a bit too much for me. Overall, Daisy Marc Jacobs is a fun and feminine fragrance, but it may be better suited to those who enjoy more sugary, youthful scents. I'd give it 3 stars because while the scent is pleasant at first, it becomes too sweet for my taste as it wears on."

To me its scent feels like it's from soft-pink & off-white flowers, with a delicate subtleness that doesn't overpower, but instead compliments the wearer in a subtle yet noticeable way. Some floral perfumes gave a very potpourri-esque or heavy vibe that reminds you of your grandmother's house. But Daisy is one of the most fresh & clean floral perfumes that I've ever tried. Not exactly like a clean linen smell with flower notes, but  more elevated to the nth degree- it radiates youth and spring and sunshine, to me"

The opening is bright and sweet without being overpowering.  u2022 Heart Notes: Gardenia, jasmine, and violet. These floral notes give the perfume a delicate, feminine essence.  u2022 Base Notes: Musk, vanilla, and white woods. The dry-down is warm and subtly sweet, balancing the brightness of the top and middle notes.  Longevity: Moderate. It lasts around 4u20136 hours on the skin, which is great for a light perfume but may need reapplication for longer outings.  Projection: Soft to moderate. It's not overpowering and stays close to the skin, making it suitable for intimate settings.  Packaging: The sample bottle mimics the iconic daisy-adorned full-size version. The design perfectly reflects the youthful and carefree vibe of the fragrance.  Overall: Daisy is ideal for those who prefer light, fresh florals with a hint of warmth. It's a safe, versatile choice for anyone looking for an approachable, everyday perfume.  Would I recommend? Absolutely, especially for those new to fragrances or looking for a signature scent that's classic and approachable."

Firstly the violet, jasmine and lavender which my nose always picks up on first, followed by wild strawberry and a hint of Grapefruit and vanilla. It's a very fresh and clean perfume and isn't overly sweet although I would still class it as a gourmand scent. On drydown I get a powdery violet, wood and musk which then proceeds to stay close to my skin for about 4-5 hours. Quite a few people have told me they think it smells like honey and ask which fragrance I'm wearing that has that lovely honey aroma. To my nose there is no detectable honey note in here so maybe it's just what it morphs into with my skin chemistry/PH, who knows? Despite the various  different notes it isn't a complex fragrance at all, in fact I'd go as far as calling it a fairly 'safe' choice when it comes to fragrances. But nevertheless I have this in the full size and spritz away, especially when the weather warms up. It's an all-rounder, works for me at any time of the day and any occasion whether heading to office or an evening out.      ~ My Sephora Top 7 must-have list ~  (My top 7 must-have beauty products of all time, focusing mainly on my purchases at Sephora)  1.

Went through multiple bottles a yearu2026..for years....till, as happens with too much of anything sometimes, I hit a wall with it and our love affair ended. Apart from a few sniffs at Sephora here and there, our flame has not truly been rekindled since. I have been going through somewhat of fragrance memory journey and picked this up (rollerball) on a whim with a Christmas giftcard.   As soon as I sprayed itu2026.I was immediately transported back to over a decade ago. I was in my early 20s then and I really do find this to be a very youthful, bright, sunny, bubbly, happy, borderline-fresh floral fragrance. It is sweet but not in a gourmand way at all, in anu2026.almost honey-like way if that makes sense. I love violet and while I do smell it in MC Daisy, I wish the violet note was a bit more pronounced; that being said, I still really appreciate its presence all the same. I do get a lot of other white floral notes though they are not super defined. I definitely pick up on the juicy strawberry note, and come to think of it, I think juicy is another perfect descriptive word for this perfume as well. I personally have a harder time picking up on any of the base notes (musk, woods, vanilla) and find this one to keep pretty consistent and therefore rather linear throughout its wear and it just never really gains much depth.   Longevity is average and silage is as well.   I think a large part of why I love this is, yes, for the nostalgia and memories it evokes, but it is also just a really nice, inoffensive, u201csafeu201d fragrance."

            "review_text": "The Good: I've owned this perfume many times since its original release in 2007 but I mysteriously stopped repurchasing it. When I initially spray this on the skin I get notes of mixed floral, a stronger citrus and a touch of alcohol-which I genuinely enjoy. But this perfume really shines after it dries and mixes with my chemistry I get a wonderful, luxurious, full-bodied violet scent. It transports me to drinking wine by the countryside in a wonderfully kept garden filled with luscious violet field. Truly and classically, a sexy floral scent. I went on a perfume challenge recently and re-discovered why I liked this perfume so much back in the day, which is always a nice stroll down memory lane. The bottle is also quite gorgeous and eye-catching on a vanity, so if you're a sucker for beautiful bottles with gorgeous scents this is a classic.  The Bad: As much as I love the scent I'm incredibly disappointed by it's lasting power. As most perfumes almost fade out from the skin into a fainter version of themselves, this mysteriously disappears. Every time I use this I had to re-apply within a couple of hours and then re-apply again. I don't know if it's because it's a eau de toilette opposed to a eau de parfum or if it's something with my skin chemistry but this literally disappears without a trace... it's the strangest thing. I like a perfume that lasts at least 6 hours so I really feel like the lack of lasting power takes away from how awesome this scent is.  The Ugly/Honest: As stated, the staying power needs massive work. For a brand like Marc Jacobs, I really expect more intensity in their fragrances. I owned some of the other fragrances and don't recall any of them disappearing off my skin like this one does. Since this is the OG, I think that's a bit backwards and disappointing. The scent overall gets 4 stars but I had to knock off a star for the poor lasting power."

This fragrance, however, is so wonderful! It's a fresh, light floral scent that can be worn everyday. I will say, the longevity performance is not the best, but it is an eau de toilette, so I was not expecting the longevity performance to be as good as an eau de parfum. This is a classic for a reason!"

Long lasting too which makes this a staple in my perfume collection. Can't wait to get the bigger bottle for my Birthday! I highly recommend to friends and family of any age.

However, once it was on, it was gone. The scent lasted no more than two hours before it was gone entirely, which was extremely disappointing. While I know Eau De Toilette scents don't stay as long as Eau De Parfum ones do, I also have Bath and Body Works scents that last longer than this one does. It was disappointing because I wanted to love it, but it just missed the mark for me. MARC JACOBS Daisy Eau de Toilette"

I could not smell the top notes of berries or violet, the heart notes of sandalwood and jasmine is stronger...but being Indian..I could tell that it was more artificial smelling. I though we would get a mini version of the bottle (I keep looking at how cute it is!) but this was not even a deluxe size...but well not complaining about the size, I was not super impressed by the smell. Its not bad and it played well with my body scent...but I won't purchase it with my money. I received this product complimentary for review purposes."

Not terribly complex or layered on its own, but went well over a moss fragrance I put it over. Good staying power, works better on pulse points than as a hair perfume. Personally I prefer a deeper scent with more intrigue, definitely something earthier to root a fragrance this floral, but if you want a clean, youthful daytime floral, this is perfect for you."

The classic floral notes make me feel very feminine when I put it on. Perfect for date night! Florals can sometimes give me headaches if they're too strong, but this one was just subtle enough to not affect me. I took one star off because the scent faded pretty quickly for me, but overall this gives me modern floral femme vibes. Def not your grandma's cloying perfume!"

But, after an hour in on every occasion I used it, the scent was no longer present. I never expect an eau de toilette to last all day, but not even an hour?! I don't know if it just didn't work with my body chemistry, but I will not be purchasing. I would however consider the eau de parfum if I ever have the chance to test out the staying power."
