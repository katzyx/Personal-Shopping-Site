The clinical results weren't lying - it really does lock everything in place immediately!  What I love most about this spray is how it gives my skin this beautiful, glassy glow. The combination of hemp-derived cannabis seed extract, hyaluronic acid, and niacinamide provides incredible hydration and keeps my skin looking dewy and fresh all day long. The green cannabis glow phase adds that extra boost of hydration that really locks in the moisture.  As someone who appreciates clean beauty, I'm thrilled that this is an alcohol-free formula. The natural aloe scent is subtle and pleasant, and I love that I can refresh my makeup throughout the day without any sticky residue."

The spray feels lightweight, and it doesnu2019t leave my skin sticky or greasy. I also appreciate that itu2019s vegan and cruelty-free.

            "review_text": "This is a very nice liquid primer before applying makeup base. Shake to mix and activate the dual-phase formula. Press the hydro-fine mist pump for an all-over, even halo distribution onto skin. Use as a setting spray to lock in your look for up to 12 hours after makeup application. Allow formula one minute to set makeup. Use before makeup application to seal in skincare, prep, hydrate, and provide a natural-looking glow. Reapply throughout the day as desired to refresh skin and revitalize makeup. Hold bottle eight to 10 inches away from face and mist evenly onto skin two times. Close mouth and eyes while spraying. For a full-face look, use Hydro Grip Primer (sold separately) as your base, apply your makeup products, and then set your look with Hydro Grip Set + Refresh Spray. I highly recommend it."

I will say if you have oily skin it definitely depends on how oily you get. The dewy look may not be for you, but I actually enjoyed it and didn't want to take my makeup off at the end of the night. I've also been having trouble with under eye creasing so I sprayed some of this on my beauty blender which definitely helped with setting my under eyes.

However, I have tried this setting spray a number of times, and at the end of the workday, my makeup looks super patchy and muddy. All my contour looks streaky and inevitably my mascara rubs off and leaves marks below my eyebrows, which doesn't happen with other sprays such as the Milani make it last. Also, it seems like there is some oil within the spray that separates, so you have to make sure you shake the bottle before use. Again, great spray for light, dewy, 5-4-hour makeup, but not good for a full day of makeup."

This product, however, ticks all the boxes and more.  The radiant finish this setting spray provides is incredible. My skin looks naturally dewy and glowy without appearing greasy, which is a game-changer for me. It truly enhances the overall look of my makeup.  I put this spray to the test during a long day at work, and it held up beautifully. My makeup didn't budge, melt, or fade for up to 12 hours, just as promised.  One of the standout features for me is the clean, alcohol-free formula. My skin tends to react poorly to alcohol-based products, often feeling dry and tight. With this setting spray, I experienced none of that discomfort, in fact It feels hydrating and soothing."

To put this to the test I swatched a glitter and matte eyeshadow, sprayed it with the spray, and then did two more swatches with no spray. I rubbed over all of the swatches after the spray dried to see how well the eyeshadow stayed put. The top two had the spray. You can see the shimmer moved around quite a bit but not nearly as much as the swatch with no spray. The matte shade smudged a little with the spray applied but not nearly as much as any of the others. You can decide for yourself if you like this level of staying power. Personally I think this is good since I donu2019t get that much rubbing on my face."

The picture will prove the size but even if it was the small one itu2019s still $10 cheaper. Anyway, the spray is a little aggressive lol but covers quickly. Unfortunately I am an oily girl in my t-zone and this makes me look like a grease ball in an hour. I am going to try it under makeup so hopefully I can make the product work for me. But if youu2019ve got really dry skin this would be amazing for you."

I appreciate the glow especially for an early morning clinic.

I will say I think if I had applied more of this product it might've stayed on a lot better.
