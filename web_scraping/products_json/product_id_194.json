Itu2019s fine just very light and one-note, so I donu2019t think itu2019s worth the price."

I bought the travel size and have already used half of it quickly, so I took advantage of the 20% off full-size fragrances to purchase a full bottle. This is exactly what I seek in a vanilla gourmand fragrance!"

I love that this is made with clean ingredients as well. This lasts on my for a few hours. I recommend to layer with their body oil for extra staying power.

This smells AMAZING.  To me, it smells like a fireplace lit room with hot chocolate and caramel chocolate mousse pie. Not cloying.  NOT artificially as some reviews state.  Def not cheap.  A vanilla candle couldn't smell this good.  This one is really, really well concocted.  If you are into gourmands, you should try this.  Atypical, warm and sensual. Fragrances fall into 3 price cats: Cheap - Don't do this ladies.  Just don't. Medium - What most these are.  When you buy frags in this price range, you need to search for the best.  Sometimes, the best will surprise you.  Sis, I wasn't even going to try this one. Expensive - Be careful.  Not all high dollar perfumes are good.  Some are amazing, but have sketch ingredients."

I must say upon initial spray it was rather disappointing and almost smelled skin like? I got no vanilla cone or chocolate everyone had been raving about? After waiting a couple minutes the dry down was so delicious and I absolutely understand the hype now! I get the chocolate note which I feel mostly shines through in this perfume as well as the waffle coney vanilla and after several hours it dries down even more deliciousud83cudf66. The projection is quite good as I catch whiffs of it throughout the day, I would also say the longevity is about 5-6 hours until it fully settles into the skin. My boyfriend said I smell like candy and he isn't one to compliment perfumes so I'd say that's a great thing! I'll definitely be purchasing again!"

(I'm not the best at describing perfumes I'm aware that I'm horrible at it ud83dude05 don't hold it against me haha) but it smells exactly like you'd expect,  it's a very light chocolately scent , I hope it comes back in stock again soon and hopefully even in a perfume gift set like it did before and I wish I was able to get my hands on that perfume set ud83dude1e"

After a few months of still searching for a signature scent I kept seeing reviews on this one pop up, and I decided I had to go back and spray it on my skinu2026 and oh my word. So much better! Should have done this in the first place seeing as this is how you tell if your body chemistry mixes well with any perfume. Now I am obsessed. I wish it was a little bit stronger, but it is still present and longevity on me is pretty great. So I definitely recommend for a intriguing vanilla with a hint of woodsy/musk and a even lighter hint of chocolate that makes this super unique in my opinion."

I donu2019t think itu2019s an immature scent or mature, just something simple and true to vanilla scent. It definitely gets more melty and groumand as it wears where when I first tested it out I was overwhelmed by a cheap caramel-chocolate synthetic scent, but that went away in maybe 10 minutes.   It doesnu2019t wear for a very long time but as far as other vanilla perfumes who manage to avoid the synthetic scent I feel this price is fairly low for a full sized bottle so I canu2019t complain."

I will be showing my age here, but this perfume smells exactly like Coty Vanilla Fields from the 90s. Pretty much dead on. I saw someone else put that in a review as well so I know its not just me. When I first put this on it has a sharp note to it. On the dry down I don't get any vanilla at all. I pretty much just get baby powder. Lasting power is mediocre on me, sillage is medium. I don't hate it. I just don't get much vanilla or sweet out of it.  I will use it to layer with other things to help take away the sharpness but I probably won't repurchase."

I was hoping for chocolate cake and vanilla frosting as promised but neither I, nor anyone around me, are getting baked goods vibes.   Dulce opens with delicate woody spiciness. It's warm and there's some gentle sweetness to it. But the opening does not give me delicious dessert. The woodiness remains as the perfume develops into vanilla extract spilled a couple feet away. It's very distant and almost immediately becomes a skin scent. Chocolate is there as a background role. It's Tree #6 in a school play. If I didn't know it was one of the notes, I would've assumed the perfume just has some musk in there.   It's not a projecting perfume. Most people can't smell it on me unless their nose is like right up to my skin. And I stop smelling it after a couple hours.   As a skin scent, this is fine. I just wish I was more prepared to smell like a tree stump and less like a vanilla cupcake."

I will enjoy this fragrance as a car scent or in a candle maybe, but for wearing it itu2019s a no-no. The chocolate and vanilla are very fake, almost chemical and extremely sweet."

To me it smells similar to L'Etang Noir by Maison Louis Marie (but LML is better), which is nice...but I wanted something creamy and ice cream-like. This has a very faint chai smell, which I do like, but the scent is so soft. Overall I find it alright, but nothing wildly exciting."

While there are slight woody touches, this is a very basic fragrance and is a step above body spray imo. I was just hoping for more depth. It does not project or last well as it sits incredibly close to the skin. I'll just be using this as a layering fragrance for when I want to add a bit of sweet vanilla, so for that purpose it does the job well. Not a bad scent, just boring. If you are looking for a basic vanilla it may be worth a sniff though."

On my skin, the vanilla smells more like a vanilla scent marketed as a vanilla bean, and I think that is due to the chocolate or nude musk that gives it a rich warmth to the fragrance. There is also a slight woodiness which comes from the Hinoki wood that turns into a hint of spice the longer it sits on my skin. This is not a super sweet vanilla, but it is a rich, warm, and cozy one that sits closer to the skin and one that's perfect for fall. The first time that I wore it, my husband complimented me on it and said that it reminded him of a rich and gourmand vanilla bean scent. If you prefer a sweeter vanilla, Dulce layers beautifully with Nemat Vanilla Musk oil."

Unless you're smelling it up close, you don't get that slight sour touch and it just smells slightly spicy. I don't smell chocolate. Maybe a slight chocolate nuance because the vanilla smells very decadent and creamy. it's really a delicious vanilla, like the type you smell when walking by a waffle or dessert shop. it's not a love yet, just because of the sour touch, but I think I will grow to love it sooner or later. The vanilla in here reminds me of tom ford metallique without the aldehyde and a little spicy(?) touch instead."
