I can't describe it but it makes me think of hippies lol. the only change I liked is the packaging. I dont like tub moisturizers and this one let's you choose whether you want the refill or tub."

It honestly doesn't have much of scent at all, maybe slight juniper scent but even that is hardly there and the vanilla is so weak is basically non existent. It just smells like regular unscented lotion, they really need to up the fragrance in this and make the vanilla sweeter. It's a good for moisturizing/layering if you just want somethig to pair perfume with but other than that there's other vanilla scents lotions and body butters that are better."

I actually HATE them because they've created the most delicious vanilla scent in this butter. I am NOT typically a vanilla scent girly - I find them incredibly basic and flat. NOT THIS ONE. The juniper berries and violet combined with the vanilla and cedar base notes make my eyes wanna roll back in my head. I see reviews complaining the smell is not great or not vanilla. Remember to take these with a grain of salt, as not everyone will have the same olfactory experience as you. I highly encourage you to smell this in store and buy the small travel size if you're unsure. Once I figure out which perfume to layer this with to make the smell last longer, IT'S SOOOOOOOOOO OVER!!!  Oh yeah, it's moisturizing and will leave a faint glow (no shimmer, just very emollient). Don't use in places you're prone to breaking out (e.g. back, butt). Lastly, I will never buy full size even though I am capable because that is egregious, unnecessary, and a little goes a long way."

Firstly the size I purchased (400ml) did not come with a jar. Although I wasn't happy about this, I figured id buy the size that came with the jar as well.  However after smelling the product I'm confused as to where the vanilla smell is. It give a slight smell of something in the beginning but the smell immediately leaves once applied and smells really strange almost like oil or a weird yogourt. Im not sure how to describe it. I tried to cover it with Kayla vanilla which I purchased to layer with the vanilla body butter however that didn't work. I took a shower to wash the product off and immediately returned it that day. Im going to try smelling the other scents in store maybe this one was just off.  as for the hydration it does work. very oily so don't use much product but my skin did feel amazing if it wasn't for the awful smell I would keep it. However I'll be returning both the scrub and the butter immediately.  if you live near a Sephora go into store before purchasing, I don't recommend buy this product online."

The scent is noticeable, but not overpowering. It is a pleasant vanilla that reminds me of cookies or baked goods. I have gotten several compliments that I smell nice on days when I use it. The packaging that I was sent was really pretty plastic jar. It is hefty and durable which is good because it will be able to withstand being refilled several times with the refill packages. With the product being in a jar, the application is with your hands so I would suggest using some kind of spatula to avoid getting bacteria in the jar. The product absorbs quickly into the skin and is deeply moisturizing. I do not feel like it is greasy at all. My skin looks and feels amazing after using it. I would recommend it!"

She has bath and body products that are sourced from Argan Oil. I specifically wanted to try her body butters because they all look amazing!     I was not disappointed with my inital expectations from this body butter. This body Moisturizer absorbed instantly on my dry skin, and I didn't have to reapply this butter more than once a day.     I applied after I took a hot shower because the heat helps to open your pores, and applies more evenly.     This body butter is instantly hydrating and also helps with toning and firmness.     The texture has An velvety, and a silky- soft whipped cream texture which I also love!     The scent was called Vanilla Vibezzz and it is considered Clean Beauty at Sephora.     This product is made with 100 % plant-based fragrances.     This has An refill system, for the full-size product that comes in An Amber Glass Jar that can be reused several times, and, amazingly, it's sustainable.   The TOP notes are included: Bergamot, and Juniper Berries. The heart is Violet. The base has slight notes of Cedarwood and Vanilla Bean.  I love that Josie Maran is both A fragrance purist, and a planet lover's. They only use only 100% plant-based essences, real fruits, nuts, woods, and plants! Overall, I highly recommend this product and brand now that I have tried this out recently. 5 out of 5 stars for quality, performance, and sustainability.   "

The best way I can describe it is if you're at an amusement park and you pass the funnel cake or ice cream shop and smell the fresh baked cones. It's like a not too sweet but sugary baked good with the smell of glazed berries on top. It's quite addicting. I hope she makes a body spray in this scent. I'd definitely buy it. It's still very moisturizing and seems to sink into the skin faster than before. The only criticism is that they gave us less product, and the price doesn't reflect that. For 2 oz of missing product id expect them to lower the price also, but that doesn't happen during the greedy times we're living in. Price does factor into my rating also, but I'd still recommend trying to mini version."

The texture is very nice on the skin and doesnu2019t leave my skin feeling greasy or die after applying. My skin feels super hydrated and lasts hours on end. The smell stays just as long as the hydration. I couldnu2019t be more happy with this product!"

It's not a super thick body butter and has more of a lotion consistency, more like a thicker lotion. Its easy to spread and absorb. Skin is left very smooth. However, I do not like this scent. It does not smell like any vanilla I have tried. In the tub, it smells like cheesecake. And applied on me, it initially smells like berries, but immediately becomes this weird artificial scented eraser scent that reminds me of elementary school. Its almost a rubbery scent. I like this body butter enough to try in another scent. Hopefully the tangerine one smells better! Good thing the scent is rather light and not too strong. Recommend the formula, but go smell it in store first. Vanilla Vibezzz does not vibe with me."

This product was a gift from Skeepers and Josie Maran Thank you!"
