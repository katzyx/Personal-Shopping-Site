            "review_text": "Preface: I prefer subtle musk, warm, gourmand fragrances. My rating accounts for packaging and scent. Fragrance: I was concerned after the initial spray because it was quite strong and the amber and spice overpowered the vanilla and sweetness. I generally use perfume on my clothing to avoid any unexpected/unpleasant reactions on my skin, but I did test inside my elbow to compare. Once the spray dried down and settled, the vanilla came through and the sweetness balanced very nicely with the initial wet scents. It turned into a very nice, mature, and complex balance, and settled into a warmer musk thay I was looking for. The spray on the skin sped up the process and I found the vanilla tones in the middle as opposed to the end on the fabric test. It is quite stronger than my daily scent (Juliette-not a perfume and Replics-Coffee shop)  but something that will pair well with a warm cozy sweater on an evening out.  I layered with with a vanilla base and it was perfect for my taste.  The disappointing part: the mini is a spray in a glass bottle. The top is not very secure in comparison to my other minis and I'd lost almost 1/4 of the bottle in shipping. Make sure you check the top when you purchase to make sure it has not leaked and is secure!"

If you are a Glossier lover (especially before the reformulation), but want something a bit more feminine TRY THIS! It opens with a clean/peppery/musky scent, then on the dry down there is a beautiful sweetness from the carnation and vanilla notes. It has quickly become my daily go-to and I know I'll repurchase so long as the formulation stays the same.   I don't have any problem with the bottle's sprayer as others have, but I picked mine up directly in-store--perhaps the bottle gets thrown around too much during the shipping process? Not sure, but either way, I definitely recommend this perfume (:   *I didn't receive a gift or was incentivized to write this review; all my own thoughts baby!*"

The scent doesn't maintain it's initial strength for even an hour, and after 2 hours it's barely noticeable. The scent does linger on clothing and hair, but you wouldn't notice it unless you're holding it up to your face. Also, I wish the smell projected a bit more since it is such a nice smell, but it sits very close to the skin. The third reason this isn't perfect for me is a personal preference, but I wish this perfume had a touch more complexity. It really does smell just like amber and vanilla, which is still beautiful, but if it had just a little something more, it would be perfect.   I got the travel size to test out whether or not I'd buy a full size version, and I'm still torn. It would be a great layering perfume with something more long lasting. I do adore this scent on it's own, but it just doesn't have any longevity."

So when I wanted to try the 7 Virtues line I was excited to find out that they were launching a skin scent as well,  Amber Vanilla.  I was immediately reminded of Glossier's You. However, there is a difference. This has a subdued light vanilla with a sheer fresh carnation in the background.  The one thing that I really appreciate about skin scents is that more or less you can wear them year round, they suit all types of climates.  This fragrance is no exception.  I love it.  Even a few hours later when I think that the fragrance has died down someone will tell me that I smell really good and ask what I am wearing, so I know it is still lingering even when I can't always detect it.  Love this cozy scent."

It is not a scent I would have been drawn to but here I am, in love once again. These scents are so beautifully crafted, I love how each one has the u2018best fitu2019 on each. I wear each of them depending on my mood or what I want to achieve that day. All lasting fragrances but not overpowering which is important for working in a restaurant.

I would say this is a perfectly acceptable, nice, inoffensive scent. It is very similar to all the other skin scents like JHAG Not a Perfume, Phlur Missing Person, and I can see how people are comparing it to Glossier You (but I think You has more oomph to it, more going on). I think the closest is probably Missing Person. This may be a touch sweeter but if you have all these other scents, or one of them, you probably don't need this one as well unless you love all the slight different nuances between them. I will keep the travel size and probably use it to layer with other perfumes I have, but I'm not going to bother getting the full size. I gave it 3 stars because it's fine, I'll use it up, but it isn't blowing me away and nothing all that new."
