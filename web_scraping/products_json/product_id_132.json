But it also is so much harder to remove than other tubing mascaras that, for me, it is only slightly better than breaking out a traditional waterproof.

Doesnu2019t flake off and get into eyes like many tubing mascaras sometimes do. Doesnu2019t transfer under my eyes even when hot and humid. Washes off easily. I apply two coats without waiting in between, I find this works best for me because itu2019s not a wet formula, so it doesnu2019t weigh your lashes down.  This is my favorite mascara at the moment!"

I have naturally long lashes and all the mascaras that made them look better would flake or smudge, or they were virtually impossible to take off at night. This mascara lengthens and adds volume to my lashes without smudging throughout the day, yet comes off super easily with makeup remover! I have found my holy grail."
