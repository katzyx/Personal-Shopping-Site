After just a few uses, my eyes became extremely swollen, my under eye became itchy and red, and my vision was effected substantially due to the swelling!

I waited 30 seconds and it was absorbed. However, the price point of this is outrageous and I\u2019m not sure something I would ever indulge in unless I was Taylor Swift."

It sinks into the skin beautifully, leaving a nice glow behind in it\u2019s wake. The scent is extremely light, but still there and what I would describe as botanical. It doesn\u2019t smell earthy, or mossy. It almost smells like foliage that has been rained on! It truly is a unique smell, and one that I found myself indulging in with every application. If you are okay with a light amount of fragrance you would like this one! It does contain fragrance as one of the ingredients though, so the scent is not natural to the actives. There are 2 things that I did NOT like about this product. The first is that after using for a few days, I started to notice milia in the area between my under eye and my nose, almost in the corner of my eye. It wasn\u2019t awful, but it was certainly there. I felt as if this was clogging those pores a little bit, but they weren\u2019t dark they were white which is what leads me to believe it was milia. After stopping use for a day, that went away. It was only on reapplication when it appeared again. The other negative for me personally is the CVS Receipt-length Ingredients list. This includes many ingredients that I don\u2019t love, including Titanium Dioxide, Phenoxyethanol, multiple PEG/PPGs, Tetraacetylphytosphingosine (some forms of this are known to be hazardous to the eyes?!), Bht which has a moderate concern for causing cancer and a high concern for allergies & immunotoxicity, and Alumina which is supposed to be used a temporary relief of dry skin\u2026not long term! After I went through the ingredient list, I actually downgraded by a star. At first I was going to give 4 stars, but this is a laundry list of ingredients and a lot of them most people would not be able to pronounce, and we certainly shouldn\u2019t be regularly applying to our skin \u2013 especially an area as delicate as the eyes!"

Targeting the delicate under-eye area, this cream promises to diminish dark circles while providing deep hydration and anti-aging benefits. After incorporating it into my nightly skincare routine for several weeks, I'm pleased to share my experience. First and foremost, let's address the notorious issue of dark circles. Whether caused by genetics, lack of sleep, or stress, these pesky under-eye shadows can be challenging to combat. However, La Mer's Eye Concentrate rises to the occasion admirably and this cream significantly reduced the appearance of my dark circles over time. Not only did it lighten the pigmentation, but it also improved the overall brightness and radiance of my under-eye area.  One of the standout features of this eye cream is its potency. Despite its luxurious texture, a little goes a long way. A small dab of the product is all that's needed to cover both under-eye areas, ensuring that the jar lasts for an extended period. This efficiency not only enhances the value of the product but also underscores its effectiveness.  The Eye Concentrate excels in providing intense hydration and combating signs of aging. The delicate skin around the eyes is particularly susceptible to dryness and fine lines, but this cream delivers a surge of moisture that leaves the skin feeling supple and nourished. With continued use, I noticed a visible improvement in the firmness and elasticity of my under-eye area, resulting in a more youthful and rejuvenated appearance.  While La Mer's products are undeniably luxurious, they come with a hefty price tag. However, considering the exceptional quality and results delivered by The Eye Concentrate, I believe it's a worthwhile investment for those seeking to target dark circles and achieve overall eye rejuvenation.

This lightweight eye cream is not supposed to be watery, and shouldn\u2019t cause irritation, swollen eyes, or allergies. It\u2019s luxurious, has an amazing puffy texture, and leaves your skin around the eyes hydrated and bouncy. My sensitive skin loves it! For comparison, I added a picture of two sample sizes I took circa April 2023 - the watery one in the back is from the Sephora luxury set, and the one in the front is from the La Mer store.

If you want to try before you buy go to the La Mer counter at your local Neiman Marcus and they'll give you a sample for free. I've seen mixed reviews on this with people having bad reactions so I would definitely test it on your skin first. If it does work for your skin, commit and use the tiniest amount when you wake up and before you go to bed. Dab your finger once where you can still see your finger through it. Do not scoop. I promise a single dab is enough for both eyes because as creamy as it looks it spreads thin. This will continue to be a staple in my beauty routine."

I purchased this product at the La Mer counter at Square One in Mississauga, not at Sephora, and they did replace the bottle with another product free of charge.

It did nothing and I actually hated the filler and couldn\u2019t wait for it to dissolve. After having already gone through extreme and costly measures to rid my under eye darkness, I turned to the La Mer Eye Concentrate. After 2 weeks of consistently using it morning and night, I saw a dramatic improvement - see before/after photos. I\u2019m approaching my mid-thirties now and my under eyes are so bright that I don\u2019t even need to wear concealer. I\u2019m so happy with this product and recommend it to all my friends. It is worth every penny since it actually breeds results. Most eye creams are just moisturizers packaged in small tubs with a price hike. This is the real deal. Just make sure you use it twice a day and continue to use it if you want to maintain results. I did venture out recently and tried their eye and expression cream - that works just as good but even better as it can be used on wrinkles all around the face and adds hydration on eyelids - it\u2019s just more expensive. I may use that more when I\u2019m in my forties. Idk what their miracle broth is made of, but it truly is a miracle. La Mer is the way to go for age-defying results."

Consistency is different, too: more watery and yellow. On La Mer website and elsewhere, I have read countless reviews similar to mine: women who used to love the eye concentrate, but upon trying the reformulated cream, got severe contact dermatitis and irritation that had to be treated with steroids and antihistamines. My eyelids are still so swollen and itchy. I\u2019m extremely disappointed that after so many comments (there was even a lawsuit!) La Mer is not listening to their customers.

I have president dark circles and frankly haven't found any product that helps with them, so I went in not expecting much anyway. I noticed no change in dark circles, but slight improvement in puffiness and fine lines. I do like that this product is a little thinner than some creams, which allows it to spread smoothly without tugging the skin, and makes a little bit go a long way. It has a pleasant green scent that's very light, and it did not both my eyes or skin at all. Some eye creams run into my eyes and cause burning, singing, and watering - I had none of these issues with The Eye Concentrate. Overall it's just ok. Nothing spectacular, performing about the same as many other products I've tried (and many more modestly process). Again this is granting that I don't think ANY eye cream helps with finishing my dark circles."

I took pictures to compare the difference between my eyes before I applied the concentrate vs how it looked 5 mins and 10+ minutes after and you can clearly see the improvement in the appearance of fine lines! By the pictures you can also notice a decrease in puffiness and smoother skin texture.  I then applied to the second eye area and noticed the improvement as well. No lie, it works but take pics so you can compare.   Definitely impressed as other products I\u2019ve tried that target fine lines typically do not work for me. Definitely recommend this eye concentrate.   Please note that I did not use it for dark circles therefore I cannot comment on its effectiveness on that."
