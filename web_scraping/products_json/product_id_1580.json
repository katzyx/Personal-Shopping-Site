I took this on vacation and thank goodness I secured it in a ziploc bag because it leaked on the way there, and back even after feeling like I did everything I could to secure it."

But wow this tanning lotion. I, like many girls love to tan, but donu2019t want the damage of tanning beds and laying under the sun. Iu2019ve used many different tanning lotions and always have the same issue: 1. The product is not dark enough or natural 2. I have to leave it on for hours, and they ALWAYS stain my sheets and clothes 3. Are streaky or fade streaky 4. Theyu2019re sticky and annoy me all day so I end up washing it before it gets to the level I want.  Now this tan lotion from tan luxe 1. I donu2019t even have to exfoliate my skin before I apply and it still goes on streak free 2. The texture is amazing, it allows me to blend it perfectly and donu2019t have to rub it in for long before it gets absorbed 3. Within 2 hours Iu2019m noticeably darker and the next day very tanned 4. It stays on for a while without fading and it fades very gradually and without getting patchy 5. You only need to use a little to see results. 6. It smells great when you apply, as it develops it has only the mildest hint of tanning lotion, and itu2019s not sticky as it dries. Iu2019m curious to try the tanning drops for the face."

Seems minimal when first smelling/applying but the scent ends up getting stronger as the tan develops. Also the tan takes about 6 hours to start developing rather then the 2 it says on the bottle. The formula is very liquidy which I actually like since it dries down very quickly. Overall a good purchase if you like gradual tanners and donu2019t mind the self tan scent."
