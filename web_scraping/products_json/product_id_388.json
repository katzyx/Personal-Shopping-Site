Also, it’s important to understand that there’s no magical ingredient already discovered that have the power of reverse aging permanently so don’t be fooled. With that being said, the serum is really hydrating, feels great on the skin and is absorbed really quickly. If that’s worth 200$ for you, go for it!"

While I noticed some slight improvement in my pores, the effect was not drastic and I doubt anyone would notice.

			"review_text": "Gifted by Dr. Barbara Sturm | I have used a plethora of facial serums in my lifetime. It becomes tiring after countless products trial and errors. My skin is easily irritated and sensitive which makes it far more difficult when sampling and trying new products. The redness one product would produce, another would have to counter, followed by another product that causes dryness which required ANOTHER to replenish moisture. THIS SERUM ACHIEVES ALL THE BENEFITS IN JUST ONE!!! My skin has changed as I entered my 30s and this serum has been such a great addition to my skincare needs. I’ve noticed that not only does my irritation areas calm and redness subside, but also packs a punch of moisture which address the little lines near my eyes and especially my neck! My neck was a problem area of mine as my face skin looked ok but my neck looked not so great. I’ve been using this for about 2 weeks now from the time it arrived and I am hooked! I’m usually not one for expensive skincare but honestly the investment is absolutely worth it! My face and neck feel and look so good I can already see some improvement in moisture and retention. The serum is easily absorbed by my skin and doesn’t leave a greasy or shiny residue. I can apply my moisturizer soon after and it does a great job of not causing a chemical reaction where the cream won’t absorb and/or makeup begins to peel because of the product build up. A little goes a LONG way and you don’t need very much as it is RICH and easily distributed. Just one dropper full will cover your entire face and neck. Even then I find myself having to use less than that. Honestly, it’s taken care of the dehydrated eye skin area. It’s a great serum to have in your skincare arsenal. I’ve used with other Dr. Barbara Sturm products and it really does compliment them. Definitely a great new brand to replace multiple steps in my already lengthy routine. Im happy with this serum! 9/10! (1 point off due to price, but so worth it!) Before & After below"

The first thing I noticed was how nourished my skin felt after applying it. The cream is packed with antioxidants and ingredients that reduce visible signs of irritation, which really helped to calm my skin down. I was especially impressed with how it reduced the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles. I've been using this product for a few weeks now, and I can already see a noticeable difference in the texture of my skin. It feels smoother and more plump, which makes me look and feel more youthful. Finally, the anti-aging powerhouses Purslane and Skullcap are key active, high concentration ingredients that really make this product stand out. I can feel the difference in the quality of the ingredients, and I'm confident that I'm giving my skin the best possible care. Overall, I would highly recommend the Potent Hydration and Anti-Aging Cocktail to anyone who is looking for a high-quality skincare product that really delivers results. It's packed with nourishing ingredients, it's incredibly hydrating, and it really does reduce the visible signs of aging. If you're looking for a new addition to your skincare routine, this product is definitely worth trying out. gifted by Dr. Barbara Sturm"

I wish this also came in a pump dispenser instead of a dropper form, so the packing leaves a lot to be desired.

It keeps any dry flaky skin away, especially when used with the cream & plumps up fine lines. I’m not sure I’ve seen results yet that may justify repurchasing this; I’d have to see how long this bottle lasts because a little really does go a long way & it sinks in so beautifully with no stickiness or residue.

Overall, my skin feels more hydrated and the texture has improved slightly, but it’s hard to tell if it’s due to the serum or cream. Over time, I will see if this serum is worth the price, so far, I don’t know if it is worth the high price point because I’ve used other serums that gave me similar results and they are much less. Lastly, the packaging could use some work. when my serum came. The dropper bottle was in two pieces. I had to figure out how to put it back together.

I was hoping this would be the same but this one is a bit different it was slightly tacky and greasy. I did have a bit sensitivity to this serum and broke out. I think possibly because of it taking a while to absorb fully. I do think it adds hydration , radiance, and is plumping ! I’d recommend for people who aren’t picky with slightly sticky/greasy texture since it does add radiance and plumps my skin."

However, I heard all the hype and was fortunate enough to receive this complimentary from Dr. Barbara Sturm, so I gave it a whirl.  It didn’t take long for me to understand the hype. My skin started looking more even, more radiant, more healthy quite rapidly.  There’s a few possibilities to explain what happened here. One, the product itself might be formulated with higher grade ingredients. This applies especially with any plant-based ingredients. When we see “extracts” on the label, it’s impossible to know much about the quality of the extract itself. Perhaps Dr. Sturm is using higher quality ingredients.  Secondly, I think a simplistic formula might actually be…well, best. The fewer variables there are in a product, the lower the risk for the opposite effect from a product (ie: irritation, allergy, etc). While this has a short ingredients list, I actually do think that is a better approach.  Ultimately, I do feel conflicted after trying this!! I had great results, but the price point is still very high. I have inner conflict over the inaccessibility issue of skincare. Thus I will ultimately make my ranking on results and exclude the price point which…shockingly, means, I have to give this a 5 star review."

I have combination skin and my t-zone can get extremely oily in the hot and humid environment I’m in, so I’m always on the lookout for a serum I can wear by itself (without a cream) during the day. I prefer it, as serums usually don’t make my skin oilier, but they have to be hydrating enough on their own. This serum does a great job at that. I spray my face with water, then apply a few drops of this product and tap it in.   It feels hydrating, luxurious and light on my skin. It’s not sticky and the scent is pleasant. I’m very pleased with it so far and never used a product with Gluthatione, Skullcap or Purslane extract. I can’t wait to see long term results.

As for the way it makes my skin feel and look, it is hydrating and makes it appear more rested, calm, and healthy.  It plays well under makeup, too!    I received this complimentary from Dr. Barbara Sturm and Skeepers to test, and I genuinely feel as this is worth the $ for the right skin type.  I think it’s best suited for those that are actively in their 30s+ and already have other anti-aging measures in place to help make the most of this product because it is definitely on the pricier side, but the immediate results are nice.

And, of course, when trying to return it the Sephora employees are suspicious that I just dumped it into another jar. This last time I brought one to show what it should look like. You can’t buy it in store and now I worry that it will happen again and I might have a harder time with the return.

I see reviews in which people state they only use the serum around areas with fine lines, or they only use a few drops, so “a little goes a long way.” The problem, and this is completely evidence based, is that Sturm has chosen dropped packaging. Which means that the product must be used within 90 days, or it will oxidize and lose potency. Please research the process of oxidation in skincare. All skincare should be in air tight containers to prevent oxidation. The best brands are. I’ve personally reached out to brands I wanted to love and challenged them on their packaging. One very popular brand blatantly lied to me and insisted that their products did not oxidize, which is just not true or possible. All chemical compounds (i.e everything) exposed to light and air will be altered and lose potency.   Save your money unless you can afford to go through the entire bottle in 90 days. Go see a dermatologist and get a five dollar tretinoin prescription and use a nice moisturizer over it.   I gave the product three stars. It’s a nice product. Her products are generally nice. I personally love her toner and use it every day.   To the person who complained about Phenoxyethanol: it’s in almost every product on the market. It’s a germicidal preservative. If it wasn’t in products they would be even more prohibitively expensive because they wouldn’t be shelf stable and thus companies could not scale product and keep back stock. It’s a well researched ingredient and it’s safe."

The price tag is a bit of a gut punch, but I will absolutely repurchase because my skin freaking GLOWS all day with this and her face cream."

I can definitely see a difference in the firmness of my skin as well. So good! Look up Skin Barrier Function and why it’s so important. When you truly understand what Sturm products do for you, you will completely obsessed! I’m a licensed esthetician so I do know skin and ingredients very well."

			"review_text": "After loving a few of Dr.Sturm’s products and using some for over a year, I decided to try this serum. Trusting the brand that pride themselves on science research and not using ingredients that damage the skin barrier. So foolishly I didn’t go over every ingredient before buying and using it for two weeks. First off the texture is nothing like her HA Serum, it’s much thicker and on the sticky side so I only used it at night. I started to breakout and couldn’t understand why. The only thing that had changed was adding this serum. I decided to go through the ingredients and was shocked that it contain Phenoxyethanol! If you do your research on that ingredient you might think twice before putting it on your face. I do have sensitive skin but the past 5 years since using “cleaner” products and no fragrance in them my skin has been clear. I stopped using this serum 10 days ago and my skin is back to normal. Another thing to note is that I was talking with my friend about this serum because she was the one who introduced me to the line. She said she used this serum for 3 months without a reaction but said it did nothing for fine lines. It gives a temporary plump while it is on but no long term results. If this Super Anti-aging serum works for you that’s great but try not using it for a week and see if the results are still there?!? I have no problem paying for a $350 quality serum that does what it claims BUT this serum was a huge disappointment!"

The texture of the product is unpleasant and it gives absolutely no results, good or bad. For the price of two of these serums you can buy yourself a designer bag, just consider this for a second."

My skin is hydrated and my complexion is more even.  I was skeptical because I have never heard of some of the ingredients she uses, but I was glad that she doesn't use any harsh chemicals or any of the things we shouldn't be applying to our largest organ.  It is expensive, but if you have the money, I say give it a try and always follow her serums with a good water based moisturizer to activate the HA in her serums and to seal them in."

I was considering getting filler, but decided to try this product after hearing so many rave reviews from friends about this skincare line.  I’ve been using this product along with the Dr. Barbara Sturm cleaner and face mask for a little over 3 months now.  The smile lines on my face have completely disappeared and I have no thoughts of getting filler for now.  Thank you Dr. Barbara Strum!!!"

I also noticed some fine lines around my eyes diminish. That said, I got the same results from some of my Korean serums (with very similar ingredients to this one) for a tenth of the price. If you are looking to splurge on luxury skincare this is worth it, but there are much less expensive options that have similar ingredients and offer similar results."

I have sensitive, acne prone skin and this has been great for it.  BEYOND excited Sephora is now selling this amazing line."
