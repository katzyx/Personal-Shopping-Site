My face loves it and my skin has been calmer. Canu2019t recommend it enough. I might also buy the cream version to use at night now that itu2019s cold and the heaters make the air dry at home, but honestly just to test it because even this gel one feels enough."

First off, I loved the packaging and the 1.7 ounces of product you recieve. Now letu2019s talk about the product itself.      I used an exfoliating product that I donu2019t normally use earlier in the month and it destroyed my skin barrier. It caused redness, irritation, and my skin to breakout. Well, I was hesitant at first, but I applied the skin fix barrier on my face morning and night. It was so light weight. It applied so smooth and silky. It calmed the redness, didnu2019t clog my pores, and the peptides repaired my skin barrier absolutely beautifully! My skin felt so hydrated every morning when I woke up. Also, it wore beautifully under my makeup! I will definitely be repurchasing!"

What truly sets it apart, however, is its remarkable ability to repair and strengthen my skin's barrier function. After consistent use, I've noticed a significant improvement in my skin's resilience and texture.   The gel cream's unique blend of ingredients works wonders in refining pores, reducing their appearance, and leaving my skin with a healthy, even tone. I've also noticed a decrease in irritation and inflammation, thanks to its soothing and calming properties.  Overall, I'm thoroughly enjoying this gel cream and highly recommend it to anyone seeking a creamy yet lightweight moisturizer that delivers on its promises."

It's a very lightweight formula. It absorbs quickly. My skin absolutely loves Skinfix. It's so soothing, also. Like giving your skin a much needed drink of water, but with lots of good stuff in that water.  I can tend to breakout with a lot skincare products but Skinfix never does it. This in particular is even formulated for people with oily and breakout prone skin. I'm beyond grateful to have been able to try Skinfix. Nothing else was helping and most things were making the issues worse, but irritating and clogging my pores. Skinfix has actually helped my hormonal acne. Along with, my skin feels amazing!

My skin looks and feels healthier and my fines lines and large pores are less noticeable. My skin is smooth and supple. The gel cream texture is light-weight but does the job of deeply hydrating my dehydrated skin without leaving a greasy feel or apperance. One thing I really love is the fact it's also non-comedogenic so it's safe for my blemish-prone skin. I personally have had a hard time finding a good moisturizer that doesn't cause any blemishes while deeply hydrating my dry skin. You only need 1-2 pumps and it easily spreads and absorbs into your skin quickly. It's my favorite moisturizer to apply before doing my usual makeup routine.  It is also , silicone-free and fragrance-free, vegan, gluten-free, cruelty-free, and comes in recyclable packaging!"

It provides a moderate level of moisture, making my skin feel comfortable and slightly more supple.  However, while the product promises to restore the skin barrier, I didnu2019t notice any significant improvements in my skinu2019s overall texture or resilience. Itu2019s a good option for maintaining basic hydration, but it didnu2019t stand out in terms of providing any noticeable, transformative benefits.  The fragrance-free formula is a plus for those with sensitive skin, and the packaging is hygienic and convenient to use. Overall, Skinfix Barrier+ Restoring Gel Cream is a decent moisturizer for everyday use, but it may not deliver the dramatic results some users might be looking for. Itu2019s a solid, no-frills option for basic skin hydration and barrier support."

The pump dispenser gives the perfect amount of product with a simple push. I use it daily after cleansing my face. The gel-cream goes on super smoothly, absorbing right into skin without leaving my face looking oily or causing breakouts (as other products do) It's remarkably lightweight yet incredibly hydrating.   Within a week, I noticed significant improvements to my combination skin. The once noticable pores around my cheeks and nose now appeared smaller and less noticeable..Dry spots on my cheeks feel hydrated and my normally oily forehead remains shine free throughout my day. My overall complexion appears brighter and healthier I have even received compliments on my skin which never happened before.  I honestly can't recommend Skinfix Barrier Restoring Gel Cream enough to all those struggling to find the right moisturizer with combination skin."

The lightweight gel cream feels incredibly soothing and has significantly improved my skin's texture and appearance. However, the reusable packaging has a notable flaw. The inner container can become loose within the recyclable outer shell, causing product to seep between the pieces. This issue allows air to get in, compromising the effectiveness of the push pump.

It's lightweight and easy to spread like a gel without any of the accompanying stickiness. Skinfix loaded this product with powerhouse ingredients like their patented B-L3 complex (to replenish lipids), saccharide isomerate (to strengthen the skin barrier), niacinamide (to even tone and texture, refine pores, and control oil), heptapeptide blend (to support the skin barrier), and zinc PCA (to absorb excess sebum and reduce redness).

I believe the retinol concentration was too high, and it was my initial experience with retinol. This led to my skin's protective barrier being completely stripped. To address this issue, I switched to the Skinfix Barrier+ Skin Barrier Niacinamide Restoring Gel Cream, and it has been beneficial for my skin. I no longer experience the discomfort I felt with other products. The gel appears to be more viscous than typical gel moisturizers, yet it remains lightweight. It offers moisturization without making my skin feel oily, and it doesn't leave a residue on my face, which is why I prefer using it at night. Often, I worry that my moisturizer will come off and transfer to my pillow. My skin is sensitive, and it has remained unaffected or improved since making this change. I haven't seen any new blemishes or flare-ups. It's also free of fragrance. Additionally, I appreciate the design of the packaging; it's very user-friendly."

It comes in a cool, refillable packaging that is actually an airtight container - no dipping in jars, free of dirt and bacteria! It also works great with sunscreen and makeup as well - making it my new favorite moisturizer."

Skincare is a passion of mine, and I love to discover new ways to treat my dry, dehydrated, sensitive, eczema-prone, and acne-prone skin while strengthening my skin barrier. I love the SkinFix brand. I regularly use the Triple-Lipid Peptide Cream, and it works great for my skin. However, during the summertime and hot weather, I want something a little bit lighter, so I started using the Skin Barrier Restoring Gel Cream. Even though itu2019s called a gel cream, it has a lighter, creamy-milky texture. I apply two pumps during my morning and nighttime skincare routine on my face and neck. This cream is very lightweight and fast-absorbing, not sticky, tacky, or greasy. It layers perfectly with other skincare products and doesnu2019t pill under makeup. The cream feels so nourishing on the face! It immediately hydrates and moisturizes my skin, and the hydration is long-lasting, I never feel dryness between my skincare routines. As a person with eczema and sensitive skin, I appreciate that this cream helps to improve skin barrier health and reduce visible redness. This cream is perfect for people like me, who have very dry yet acne-prone skin. I have often found myself in a cycle where treatments that helped reduce acne caused more dryness and skin barrier damage. Then, when I started using products to reduce dryness, they clogged my pores and caused acne. This cream helps with blemishes in a very gentle way, smoothing bumpy skin texture and evening skin tone. I think this cream is perfect not only for people with oily, combination, and blemish-prone skin, but also for those with normal and dry skin types, especially during the warm season and as a day cream.

I love the classic blue packaging of SkinFix with the pusher/applicator tip to dispense the product from the packaging. After the first use, I didn't notice any noticeable hydration until a few days later. I'll be applying this recovery gel cream every morning and evening. It leaves my skin looking super bright and removes excess oil around my T-zone. Now, the niacinamide has helped unclog pores on my nose and forehead and has noticeably reduced them. I appreciate that it's well made (not fancy or fancy, but not flimsy) and refillable. This design makes it less expensive to repurchase and better for the environment. Overall, this is a great product, but especially great if you have trouble tolerating moisturizers. I find it great for everyday use. Free of parabens, sulfates, and other harmful ingredients.

Since it is summer and my skin can get oily, the fact that this product is a gel formula but also helps maintain my skin barrier is crucial. It is both thick and light due to the gel formula and I used it to replace my lighter moisturizer. It didn't cause any irritation to my skin or eyes and worked perfectly under my makeup, both heavier foundations and skin tints. I use quite a few products so I am always nervous about adding or replacing products and if they cause piling but this didn't disrupt my routine at all. I also had a no-downtime chemical peel done this week and this moisturizer didn't irritate my skin, if anything, it helped keep it from getting flaky after the peel."

My skin is a bit healthier now, but I still deal with very oily, dehydrated skin that gets irritated easily and a pretty weak skin barrier. Iu2019ve tried many, many light moisturizers trying to find ones that are light enough for me to tolerate while still giving the actual benefits of a moisturizer. This is one of the few gel creams that actually provides enough occlusivity to actually be a moisturizer. Most gels or gel creams hydrate the skin but are not at all occlusive - leading to a net LOSS of hydration due to trans epidermal water loss. This one remains so, so light on the skin but still gives a light barrier to keep all the hydration in. The gel cream feels very light on the skin and sinks right in. Iu2019ve found that I do best with 3-4 pumps as my skin really seems to drink this in.  I donu2019t personally love the type of dispenser this product has, but I know this type is very popular right now. I do appreciate that it is well made (not amazing or luxurious, but not at all flimsy) and refillable. This design helps make the product a little less expensive to repurchase and better for the environment.  This is an amazing product in general, but is particularly great if you have a hard time tolerating moisturizer. My skin is a bit more resilient now, but there was a time when putting ANY moisturizer on my face would make my skin burn and turn cherry red. Everything was just too occlusive or irritating. This is the lightest moisturizer that I have ever used that still manages to give you a barrier. If you have trouble tolerating moisturizer and/or have given up finding a moisturizer, please try this one.  This review was collected as part of a promotion"

This being said, it should be known that my skin always seems to bounce between combo skin -- dry (especially in the cooler months) and finding a cream that helps balance my skin can be very difficult. However, this gel cream was just the right thing for my skin. More specifically, it has the right consistency that seamlessly blends into my skin. Unlike other gel creams that I have tried in the past, this one isn't overly jelly or slimy. You know those gel creams that just seem to be a mess? Yeah, not this one! All the while, it moisturizers and makes my skin feel super soft while remaining lightweight and soothing. I have been using this more so during the morning as I have found it is almost refreshing to put on. In my personal opinion, I don't find this gel cream to have any scent. However, I am not usually bothered by fragrance so take this with a grain of salt as I'm sure those who may struggle with it may think differently. Moreover, this cream is OK for dry skin but, I would especially recommend it to those with combo skin.

I also enjoyed that it had two types of application styles, the first is by twisting the lid and you have access to the whole product. The second and my personal favorite, you open the top lid and a small and big circle appear. As you push down the bigger-outer one, the right amount of cream comes up. I used 1-2 pumps and it was enough for me to nicely cover my face and neck. I was impressed by the amazing quality of this cream and versatility of the container.

It comes in very handy if you want to mix it with tanning drops or bronzer. I am loving how hydrating this cream is its like an iv for my skin. I love how it perks up my skin and gives it a glow. I am also finding that it is reducing the pores on my nose and forehead . This cream has a thick consistency yet goes on light. I look forward to using this everyday and I highly recommend it.

The Skinfix Barrier+ Skin Barrier Restoring Gel Cream is a crucial hydrating element that has healed my skin over the past ten days.  What I like most about this product is that it's fragrance-free and non-comedogenic. The airless pump is fantastic for easy application and ensures I get the right amount of product every time. The ingredients are specifically designed to hydrate the skin, which is crucial for me.  I started using this gel cream after my yoga sessions, which are usually in the early evening. I appreciate the inclusion of macadamia seed oil and squalane. Living in the desert where it's very dry and temperatures are over 100u00b0F, extra hydration is a necessity. This cream provides the extra moisture my skin needs, especially in the evening.  As my nighttime moisturizer, it does an excellent job of hydrating and locking in moisture. It's not too heavy but provides just the perfect amount of hydration for my skin. Plus, being non-comedogenic, it doesn't clog my pores, making it an extra benefit since I am active and care about my skin health. This review was collected as part of a promotion."

The moisturizer does contain niacinamide in it which my skin is specifically sensitive to. I notice my skin starting to break out when I use any product with niacinamide in it, therefore, I am giving it four stars instead of five. Another thing I should mention is the smell.

It looks super oily and I have actually been breaking out on my forehead and nose, which are areas I never experience breakouts. I was struggling to figure out what I was doing differently in my routine and realized that adding this in is the only real change I've made when I started using it early last week.

Iu2019ve tried dozens of moisturizers, including holy grails for many, and ended up with a mixture of deep, painful nodules, persistent pimples, red, itchy, painful rashes, severe dryness, and actual peeling. I was incredibly hesitant and fearful to try this one, terrified it would go the same as all of the others. However, I was elated to see my face clear up and finally have the glowy, healthy looking skin I havenu2019t had in probably close to 10 years.  I use this with tazarotene gel .05% and my skin looks the best it has in close to a decade. This is the one moisturizer I will continue to buy, and Iu2019m so thrilled I found it."

It lasts a long time, wears great under makeup, lightweight, and very hydrating. I read another review about dryness around the hair line, and I too have used anti fungal shampoo which helps to an extent but also dries out my skin so much. This is the only moisturizer that has helped that issue. Iu2019ve used Tatcha, Charolette Tilbury magic cream, snail serum, Laneige, the list goes on and on.. Hands down, SkinFix Skin barrier restoring Gel cream is the best! Totally recommend this product!  *Unbiased review, definitely not an influencer*"

As someone with combo skin who struggles with dry patches and oily T-zones, I've been searching for the holy grail of moisturizers forever. Well, call off the search party because I finally found it with Skinfix's barrier + restoring gel. This lightweight, fast-absorbing cream is a total game changer. Not only does it hydrate without making me greasy, but it actually strengthens my skin barrier, balances oil production, and refines pores. And the ingredients are top-notch - niacinamide, peptides, zinc, the works. As someone who cares about the environment, I appreciate Skinfixu2019s efforts to be an eco-friendly brand. They partnered with Bluebird to complete a full Life Cycle Analysis on the carbon and waste impact of the Barrier+ gel cream.  Skinfix also partnered with RePurpose Global to further reduce their environmental impact. For every pound of plastic used to make the Barrier+ gel cream tubes, Skinfix collects one pound of ocean-bound plastic waste. Itu2019s not often you find a skincare company taking such substantive action on sustainability and environmental protection. Knowing that the Barrier+ gel cream was made through eco-conscious practices and helps support plastic waste collection makes me feel good about using the product and supporting the brand. On top of all of that, I'm happy to report my skin has never looked or felt better. The only downside is having to restrain myself from slathering it on 24/7! Skinfix, you have a customer for life."

The lightweight texture feels cool and soothing on my skin, like a mini spa treatment after a long day of classes and research. If you're a student (or anyone!) struggling with imbalanced skin, this gel-cream is worth a try. Whether you're battling city pollution or late-night study sessions, this cream can help your skin find its center"

After doing my research, I was super anxious to try out the Skinfix brand as I love their 'skin nerd' take on skincare products. Needless to say I wish I would've switched to this cream sooner! My skin (early 30s) is visibly firmer, smoother, brighter, and supple since adding this product into my routine-- with NO sensitivity.

It's like a mini facial in a jar that makes your skin look and feel better instantly.  The texture is another highlight; it spreads easily and gets absorbed quickly, leaving my skin hydrated, yet not sticky. This cream is suitable for all skin types, especially those with oily and combination skin, as it provides the perfect balance of hydration without adding excess oil.  I've seen a significant change in my skin's appearance since using this product. My skin looks healthy, vibrant, and more importantly, feels comfortable and well-nourished.

Instant plumpness, instant glow, instant DEEP hydration. Instant smoothing.  On first use, I love the pump jar for sanitary purposes. It also gives you the right amount of product in one pump. The texture caught me off guard, as I was expecting something more visibly water based.Something more jelly like. To my surprise this gel-cream is just that, hydration of a gel and that comforting familiar feeling of a cream without being too heavy but, giving a nice substantial punch of hydration. I am a combo oily girl with eczema but, I am dehydrated deeply. I alway seek out a substantial amount of hydration in products but, hate when they push the boundary of feeling heavy. I have used this night and day since I received it and Iu2019m going to need a new one soon at this rate lol. And whatu2019s most impressive is, I tried this gel-cream on a patch of eczema that has flared on my shoulders and wow! Then next morning it was smoother and visibly healing. I have literally tried hundreds  of thing for my eczema including prescription creams, etc. Nothing has ever yielded these type of results! I need to look into their body care asap. I am so very excited to see long term benefits as this gel-cream has some amazing ingredients for oily/combo skin. Of course it has the B-L3 complex that helps replenished improve skins barrier function, niacinamide, and zinc pca which helps reduce redness and excess oil."

This gel cream absorbs quickly into the skin, leaving it feeling refreshed and hydrated without any greasiness.  After using it overnight, I noticed my skin looked noticeably more hydrated and plump in the morning, making it the perfect canvas for makeup or going all natural. Plus, I appreciate that it contains nourishing and anti-acne ingredients, which is a bonus for my skin concerns.

This gel cream has proven to be a soothing oasis in my skincare routine, providing much-needed relief and hydration. Here's why I believe the Skinfix Skin Barrier Restoring Gel Cream deserves recognition:  One of the standout features of this gel cream is its lightweight and non-greasy texture. Upon application, it effortlessly glides onto the skin, instantly providing a burst of cooling and calming sensation. The gel-like consistency is refreshing and absorbs quickly, leaving no residue behind. I appreciated how comfortable and weightless it felt on my skin, making it ideal for both daytime and nighttime use.  The formulation of the Skinfix Skin Barrier Restoring Gel Cream is designed to repair and strengthen the skin's natural barrier. Packed with a blend of powerful ingredients like ceramides, peptides, and hyaluronic acid, it works to replenish moisture, lock in hydration, and restore the skin's protective barrier function. Over time, I noticed a significant improvement in my skin's resilience and overall health. It felt more balanced, smoother, and less prone to irritation.  Another noteworthy aspect of this gel cream is its compatibility with sensitive skin. As someone who experiences frequent redness and sensitivity, I was relieved to find that this product did not aggravate my skin further. It is fragrance-free, hypoallergenic, and dermatologist-tested, making it suitable for those with delicate or reactive skin. I experienced no adverse reactions or breakouts while using this cream.  The packaging of the product is simple yet functional. The gel cream comes in a hygienic tube with a flip-top cap, which makes it easy to dispense and control the amount of product needed."

I have read & heard good things about this brand, so I decided to check it all out for myself. During my research, I found Skinfix isn't just a brand dermatologists recommend to patients. They also use it personally & often sell it in their offices. This says a lot about the brand. My personal results gave me insight as to why it's popular among dermatologists. The Skinfix barrier + skin barrier gel cream with BL-3 packs a punch your skin barrier will want to thank you for later. It is lightweight & typically ideal for people with more oily skin. However, I would recommend this to anyone despite skin type. The Niacinamide & patented BL-3 ingredients also hydrate extremely well. It mixes well with other ingredients like AHA & BHA for those that need it. I also found my pores seemed less visible which is why I wanted to try this product. It absorbed quickly & had a cooling effect on me. My skin felt & looked well hydrated, too. The results will speak for themselves. It being refillable makes it even more appealing."

The Skinfix Skin Barrier Restoring Gel Cream is a wonderful hybrid skincare product that was a savior for my skin. I have oily combo skin that can get pretty dry in the winter time and my skin always needs a lightweight moisturizer that isnu2019t too greasy but also gives my skin hydration. This product did a wonderful job at helping to soothe my skin barrier while not weighing my skin down. I used this product 2x day and my skin felt amazing all day and when I woke up. The texture of this product is a nice lightweight gel that sinks into my skin easily. I would absolutely recommend this product for anyone with oily combo skin or with a compromised skin barrier that is looking for a new hydrating moisturizer."

Thank you hot, dry, desert air and makeup for my already sensitive skinu2019s desperate plea for help. I have excess sebum on my nose that extends to the surrounding area out to my cheeks and under my nose leading to blackheads. Of course, I pick them leaving my skin red, inflamed, and dry. When using this gel cream during the day I notice the redness and inflammation reduce, leaving an even, plump, glowing (not greasy/sweating) appearance to my skin. Iu2019ve noticed my other breakouts reduce, and the scarring from those lessening with no new breakouts. The gel is so lightweight and instantly absorbs into my skin like itu2019s becoming a part of it, like another invisible layer/barrier to it. I can feel how u201ccoolu201d my skin feels when I apply it, like itu2019s getting a big breath of morning air. The gel doesnu2019t interfere with my makeup and helps to prep a good base for my foundation. Iu2019ve never experienced anything like this moisturizer before and I was instantly in love. I canu2019t explain how refreshed my skin feels or how I didnu2019t notice just what my skin was missing. I recommend this cream for everyone who wants a moisturizer that becomes one with your skin, that truly hydrates and restores skin"

This gel cream is perfect for those with sensitive skin like me. I have noticed remarkable improvements in my skin's texture and appearance. One of the things I love most about this product is its versatility. It works well as a standalone moisturizer or as a base for makeup, providing a smooth canvas for application. Overall, Skinfix Barrier+ Skin Barrier Restoring Gel Cream is a game-changer for anyone looking to achieve healthy, radiant skin. I can't recommend it enough!"

I really did not have high expectations with this gel moisturizer but I am very impressed with the texture and feel of this one. I actually prefer to use it in the mornings because it also serves as a really good makeup primer if you want something that will help your makeup look and feel better on the skin. A little goes a long way for me and even though it is so lightweight and in gel form, it is very moisturizing. I donu2019t think it is something I will opt for during the colder seasons as I live in the Midwest and I need something thicker when it comes to my moisturizers but, I will opt for using this one during the warmer/hotter seasons. I love the packaging, it is one of my favorites for sure! I love having control of how much product I want to use. Overall, great moisturizer!"

As I get older and quickly approach middle age, Iu2019ve noticed that my combination skin has become more extreme- I am oilier and dryer (donu2019t you just love aging?), so I need a moisturizer that is extra moisturizing that doesnu2019t exacerbate my skinu2019s oiliness. This cream works to address both my dryness and oiliness- the formula is incredibly moisturizing but not greasy, so my skin looks and feels nourished and not shiny from oil. It also seems to help control my skinu2019s sebum production and my pores love that. I like to put it on after I go for my daily run because my skin really appreciates the burst of moisture and the formulau2019s soothing properties, after an hour of sweating and coming home hot and red in the face with sensitive skin- it immediately reduces redness and irritation. It does what its namesake says it does, which is restore my skin's natural moisture barrier. After a week of usage, I am still shocked every time I go to wash my face because my skin is so incredibly soft and supple and Iu2019m just not used to that yet! As a skincare enthusiast, I appreciate the use of ingredients like niacinamide, allantoin, and hyaluronic acid which work to refine my pores, attract and retain moisture, and promote skin healing. I also love that Skinfix as a company places an emphasis on sustainability- even the design of the packaging lends itself to sustainable practices with their use of refill pods and the fact that it is recyclable. I highly recommend this to anyone who wants an immediate improvement in their skinu2019s level of hydration, to refine the look of their pores and control sebum production, and/or wants a moisturizer that will soothe sensitive skin and leave it wonderfully soft and supple."

That's really nice because some skin creams can be very overpowering and sit heavy and greasy on the skin. Not this stuff. Fresh out the shower it definitely handles any dry feeling you may have on your face, but for me it didn't last as long as I would have liked. I also have combination skin though, dry spots that need extra attention. I am definitely into using this when my skin has extra oily days, or during the summertime when you want something light and refreshing.

As an esthetician I am always looking for effective and affordable products to refer to my clients and now this one is definitely in the list. After using it for just a week my skin felt and appeared very hydrated. What I think is so cool about this product is that it says it  holds hydration in the skin for 72, I was a bit skeptical when I first saw that on the packaging but I can honestly say I really believe it does. Once you apply this to your skin youu2019ll feel an instant change and thought the day your skin stays very plump and hydrated. I added this product to my morning and night routine and itu2019s been working great for me. I rate this product a 5/5. I recommend it to anyone on the drier side or combination skin."

In fact, I just spoke to a friend about this moisturizer yesterday about how amazing it feels on my skin and how much hydration it delivers."

First thing Iu2019d love to mention about these is that the are reusable packaging. I absolutely love when a brand does work to keep their products sustainable and every little bit helps. So I love that they went refillable. I also really love the pump system so that my product stays clean and that only what Iu2019m using that day is getting touched. As far as sanitation thatu2019s huge. What I like about this cream is the way it absorbs on my face easily without being sticky. Since this is either the last or second to last step in my routine how my moisturizer dries is important to me for my makeup base. Something though that I didnu2019t like about this moisturizer is that itu2019s just not heavy enough for my dry skin in the winter its very lightweight and my skin still saw slight peeling in the tzone while using it. Using the triple lipid peptide from skinfix is much more up my alley this time of year. Iu2019d have to use longer to evaluate combining them but for now after a week I prefer that for my skin and will have to try this again in the summer"

It also helps the appearance of flakiness and dry skin all while also helping the appearance of pores, oiliness, and shine. This is an ALL OVER great product! This product also plays so well with other products which easily has made it an automatic addition to my skincare regime! I typically wear this one during the day since itu2019s so light weight!

When I first used it, I applied two pumps as the directions said and my face felt very greasy and took a long time to dry. I used it both in the morning and night. After using it at night, my face felt hydrated and plump. I know one of the main features of this product is pore refinement and oil control, but I would not say I noticed any of that at all.

It was recommended to me by my dermatologist. I have extremely dry skin and also eczema. While I absolutely love this brand I do not think this product is a good fit for my skin type. The texture and consistency of this product is very thin. I most definitely prefer a rich and thick moisturizer. I think this product might be more geared for someone with oily skin, or this may be a better product for the summer time.   I live in New York City and in the winter it is very dry, and I need something very rich. Unfortunately this does not do the job. Not only do I like my skin to feel hydrated, I also like when it looks hydrated and dewey. This seems to leave a very matte finish.

As someone with combination skin prone to congestion, finding a moisturizer that strikes the perfect balance between hydration and pore-refining benefits has been a challenge - until now.  Firstly, the refillable packaging is not only environmentally friendly but also sleek and convenient. It's a win-win for both sustainability and practicality.  Now, onto the formula itself. This gel cream is a revelation. Despite its lightweight texture, it delivers intense hydration without clogging pores or feeling heavy on the skin. The inclusion of B-L3, Skinfix's proprietary blend, is truly the secret sauce here. It not only strengthens the skin barrier but also helps refine pores, leaving my complexion looking smoother and more even-toned.  One of the things I love most about this gel cream is its versatility. It wears beautifully under makeup, providing a smooth canvas for application, and also works wonders as a nighttime moisturizer, helping to lock in moisture while I sleep.  After incorporating this gel cream into my routine, I've noticed a significant improvement in the overall health and appearance of my skin. My complexion looks more balanced, with fewer visible pores and a natural radiance that I haven't experienced in years.  In conclusion, Skinfix's Barrier+ Skin Barrier + Lightweight + Pore-Refining Refillable Gel Cream with B-L3 has become a staple in my skincare arsenal. It's rare to find a product that delivers such impressive results while also being gentle and non-irritating. If you're in search of a moisturizer that ticks all the boxes, look no further. This one is a game-changer."

I have been a Licensed Cosmetologist for over 17 years and skincare is one of my specialties. I have super sensitive, combination, acne-prone skin. I loved seeing this product line to help build my skin barrier. Having to use acne products every now and then can strip my skin barrier. This gel cream goes on very smoothly. It soaks in really fast and doesnu2019t leave any kind of oily residue. This is a great product to use on the daily to help build your skin barrier. My skin was way less reactive since starting to use this gel cream. I would say this product is probably best suited for someone with oily skin than very dry. I would highly recommend this for all ages and oily skin types as it builds your barrier while not making your skin look greasy."

The packaging is enjoyable and easy to use, especially if you like to mix other products with your moisturizer. One thing that I tend to worry about when using new product is the chance of my skin breaking out but luckily this brand is acne prone skin friendly and didnu2019t worsen my acne at all, which is rare. After one use, my skin already feels so soft and had an immediate glow. Also a lot goes a long way with this product, so itu2019ll last a while.

Lately Iu2019ve tried other products to see if I can find something to help balance different areas of my face. But noticed my skin is more sensitive than I think. Some products are either less hydrating or more irritating. With this improving my skin barrier, it keeps my skin in its natural state!

I've received compliments from friends on how smooth and glowing my face looks and I credit this product. I love that it is light weight and does not leave me oily or sticky feeling after application. The jar is refillable which is awesome, and eco friendly and makes me love this product even more. I apply this during my skincare routine in the morning as well as my nighttime routine. I am left with softer, hydrated and supple skin and that makes me so happy. The colors of the packaging remind me of the ocean too which is super pretty. Occasionally I will break out since I have combination skin, but this gel cream has been perfect and has caused no breakouts."

I typically have oily to combo skin that tends to get overly dry and dehydrated in the cold winter months. Now, let's talk about this beautiful, beneficial cream that comes in the most stunning, refillable airless pump container. It's packed full of powerhouse ingredients such as Saccharide Isomerate and Skinfix's breakthrough patented B-L3 complex that helps restore and replenish the skins natural lipids. Its texture initially looks very thick, but once you start to apply it to the skin, the gel aspect takes effect, and it's surprisingly super lightweight. It absorbs nicely into my skin without leaving a sticky residue behind and has no noticeable scent. In the few weeks I've been using this cream, I've noticed a consistent reduction with the redness of my skin and in the appearance of my enlarged pores and oiliness. It also works very well at balancing and strengthening my skin barrier, helping it to remain strong, healthy, and protected. It works really well under makeup and with other products, but it's not heavy enough on its own to give my skin the moisture it's been lacking in these cold temperatures so in my opinion for my skin this will be the perfect all around summer face cream. Overall, this is a really nice product that delivers so many great nourishing qualities to the skin and its barrier!"

So, when the Skinfix Barrier+ Gel Cream landed on my vanity, I was eager to test it out. Here's my honest review after a solid four weeks of use:   First Impressions:   The sleek, minimalist packaging and fragrance-free formula immediately won me over. The gel cream itself is lightweight and absorbs quickly, leaving a refreshing, non-greasy feel. Perfect for layering under makeup or wearing alone on warmer days.   Results:  Hydration Hero: This cream definitely delivers on the hydration front. My skin felt noticeably more supple and comfortable, even after long days in dry, winter air. Sensitivity Soother: As someone prone to redness and irritation, I was thrilled to find this cream calming and non-irritating. No flare-ups or breakouts during my testing period! Lightweight Love: This is my go-to moisturizer for daytime wear. It layers well with other products and doesn't leave any heavy residue.  But It's Not All Sunshine and Rainbows:  Not for Everyone: While it worked wonders for my sensitive skin, I wouldn't recommend this for those with oily or acne-prone skin. It might not be mattifying enough for your needs. Pricey Potion: Let's be honest, this cream doesn't come cheap. While the quality is good, the price tag might be a turnoff for some. Pump Woes: My biggest gripe is with the pump dispenser. It sometimes gets clogged and dispenses uneven amounts of product. Not a deal-breaker, but definitely a minor annoyance.  Overall:   If you're looking for a lightweight, hydrating moisturizer that's gentle enough for sensitive skin, the Skinfix Barrier+ Gel Cream is definitely worth trying. Just be aware of the price tag and consider your skin type before taking the plunge.   Honest Star Rating: 4 out of 5 stars (Would be a solid 5 if it were more affordable and had a better pump!)"

It is vegan and cruelty friendly so no guilty feeling about hurting animals and the packaging is very aesthetically pleasing and ecofriendly due to it being made from recycled plastics as well as it being refillable, another plus to the packaging is the airless pump, it makes sure that the cream does not get contaminated by bacteria in the air and makes sure that the gel cream stays sanitary. All in all, this product is a great product and would definitely buy it again.    P.S. it might break your skin out within the first week or two of using but that is normally the case when introducing new products to your skin."

One of the first things I noticed about this gel cream is its consistency. Its the perfect balance between a gel and a cream.  The push-up bottle packaging is super convenient. I love that it's refillable, #ecofriendly.  Another aspect of this product that impressed me is its subtle scent. The smell light and barely noticeable, which is perfect for me.   However, one drawback is that the gel cream can leave a slightly greasy look on the skin, especially if you apply a lot. While it's lightweight and absorbs quickly, I found that using a smaller amount helped lessen the greasiness.  Overall I think itu2019s still a great buy & definitely worth the try"

And I particularly like the history of Skinfix.  In 1850, a compound chemist in Yorkshire, England named Thomas Dixon created a u201cmiracle balmu201d that 162 years later landed in the hands of a beauty-industry veteran who acquired the formula in 2012 when she bought the brand Skinfix from Dixonu2019s great-great-great-granddaughter. I loved the lightweight feel of this formula and its light clean scent. And it contains one of my favorite ingredients niacinamide (vitamin B3). I used this mostly during the day and it's sister Barrier+ product Triple Lipid-Peptide Cream at night. At times, there wasn't enough moisture during the day for me, so I paired it with serums and sometimes I used both Barrier + products layered. My skin feels so much smoother and is holding onto moisture better. I just wish it looked as smooth as it feels. This will be a great hot-weather moisturizer for me in the Nevada summer. And for younger or more oily skin, this would be a great day and night moisturizer."

BUT again just like with the skin fix barrier triple lipid peptide cream it has a weird smell, I mean really it's not a bad scent but it just has that fragrance free smell to it and honestly I really don't like that scent. just like with the skin fix triple lipid peptide cream I'm going to continue to use it for the next few weeks. if you don't mind thatfragrance free type smell then you shouldn't have any issue with this product, it has some pretty good ingredients in it, and it says it's good for dehydration and dryness. if you have dry skin and you tend to get super dry in the winter time I definitely say give this one a shot."

            "review_text": "Skinfix gel  Texture: When opening the Skinfix barrier restoring gel cream, for the first time, I noticed itu2019s a thick cream, but is a little runny, for example, a pudding texture. Skinfix triple barrier peptide cream, instead of the gel, looks like buttercream frosting/whipped cream structure.   Scent: When I was done feeling the texture, I decided to smell the gel cream, to see if there was a scent. I thought my serum, had no fragrance, but the moisturizer, next to it made it have a scent, proving their statement of no added fragrance. In my opinion, I wish more companies did nonfragrance because plenty of people break out due to the skincare product being heavily scented.   Application: The jar, has a great design instead of taking out the moisturizer with your hand or little spoon, you press down, to get the product out. In my opinion, it is a perfect idea, because it gives you the amount you are supposed to use on your face and not overuse the product, and less messy.   Skin type: I have combination skin, which tends more to the oily side. If you have skin type like mean, this is perfect for you. I say this because when it goes on the skin, it gives it a light cooling feel, and dissolves quickly into the skin, without sitting on top of the skin. I use the gel moisturizer, I use instead, of the skin fix gel in the morning since that one is a lighter formula and more water-based feeling on the face. That is my preference, you donu2019t have to use the gel, only in the morning you can also use it at nighttime. I mentioned this because I know some people if their skin, especially on their face gets oily fast, would want a lightweight formula. I know for me if it is hot outside and if the skincare/sunscreen is a heavy formula it will make you feel more uncomfortable throughout the day, that you would just want to wash it off."

The SkinFix barrier+ Skin Barrier + Lightweight + Pore-Refining Refillable Gel Cream with B-L3 is scentless, and feels like smooth silk when you apply it to your skin; it melts into your pores effortlessly and does not leave your skin feeling heavy. It is absolutely perfect for preparing your skin for makeup, as it provides even and deep moisture to your skin, as well as an instant glow. Your foundation will not look blotchy when you put it on top of the gel cream! And it only takes one pump from the gel cream dispenser to deliver the perfect amount of product for your face (and I have a wide, round face with a square jawline and high cheekbones). I highly recommend this to transform your skin!"

I am a content creator/ influencer  and I love testing out new skincare to see what works for me and what does not. I have tested out many brands and products so I was super excited to try out this product from skinfix. First things first I love the blue jar it comes in and it looks like it will last me months which is great.

It effortlessly absorbed my excess oil, and it refined the appearance of my pores and it did soften the look of my fine lines too. My blemishes are going to fade faster,and it does make my skin feel revitalized. I personally love how it doesn't leave my skin feeling dry and doesn't cause makeup to pill. Plus, it plays well with other serums in your routine, making it a versatile addition to your skincare regimen. I will probably use this more in the summer and spring then currently in the winter unless I have a breakout."

First I'll say I love the skinfix packaging here, I find it more convenient but also cleaner then using a spatula or even worse fingers in a jar.. This dispenses the perfect amount right to you for applying. It feels really amazing when applying, thus gives a cool and soothing gel feel that isn't heavy or greasy at all. It absorbs really quickly without a heavy tacky feeling and still allows makeup application immediately after. This formula is a bit lighter then their traditional being non-comedogenic and non acnegenic but still pumps up dehydrated skin immediately giving you visible results right away. You can really watch it work it's magic on your skin barrier. It pumps up the skin and really soothes it at the same time."

I think it is probably really great for people with oily or acne-prone skin who canu2019t do thicker creams, but for me and my dry skin, it was not hydrating enough. While I do prefer a somewhat lighter cream for daytime use, this cream is extremely lightweight and absorbed super quickly into my skin. It feels like a big glass of water on my skin initially, but I did not find that the hydrated or silky, soft feeling lasted after being absorbed. I ended up following up this cream with a face oil or some other hydrating product. Given that, I definitely would not use this product at night personally. However, I do like that this cream has no fragrance, and the packaging is very unique with the pump, though it was a little confusing to use at first and I would suggest they put clearer usage instructions on the package."

I have applied it a few times at night since it absorbs quickly, and I do not have to worry about it coming off on my pillowcase. While I normally prefer a heavier moisturizer at night, this is a product that I will continue to use. I love that it has a refillable option which is slightly cheaper than repurchasing the entire product/jar.  As a beauty expert with over 23 years of experience, I know the importance of protecting my skin barrier. I have been wanting to try Skinfix products for quite some time and I am in love with the two products of theirs that I have tried.

This helps your skin restore its own skin barrier. Niacinamide helps even your skin tone and reduces the appearance of pores and supports a balanced skin barrier. I love the beautiful, light blue packaging of this gel cream. It has an easy to use pop up pump that gets just the right amount of gel cream out each time. This pop up feature is much more hygienic than dipping your fingers in a jar. It has packaging that is refillable so you can save the planet one jar at a time. You get a lot of product for your money with 1.7 fluid ounces. Skinfix Gel Cream has a beautiful, lightweight cream to gel texture that absorbs so quickly into my skin. It has a nice natural scent that reminds me of skincare I had used way back in the beginning of my career as a Beauty Expert. Once it dries itu2019s becomes unscented on your skin. My skin feels so smooth and healthy because of this amazing gel cream. You can use this in the morning and at night for optimal skin barrier defense. I use two pumps, one for my face and another one for my neck. This cream has an impressive 12 month shelf life.  This is the perfect product for an emergency skincare intervention. After one hour it will help improve your skin barrier function which is quite remarkable. What a miracle product. It also gives you long lasting hydration."

Although this cream is intended for acne-prone skin, my face has been smooth since I started using it, and Iu2019m considering making it my permanent moisturizer for my daily makeup routine. My favorite ingredient found in this gel cream is the usage of niacinamide. This ingredient is what best helps target my skin issues which includes, evening skin tone, absorbing excess oil and refining the appearance of pore size. As a student and worker, Iu2019m constantly on the go and need my makeup to stay intact for long periods of time. My only concern about this cream would have to be the price.

The regular formula has Shea butter in it which can cause pore clogging. This new formula does not have it, it's great for blemish-prone combination skin. even though it feels really lightweight I feel like I don't have to use a lot to hydrate my skin. This cream has no fragrance, which is amazing because that can also cause breakouts. It's perfect for dehydrated, dry skin. I noticed after a few days of using this gel cream that my dark spots faded a little and my skin felt softer and smoother. I also love the hygenic jar pump. This moisturizer is also really great for wearing under makeup. This is a great gel cream for dehydrated skin."

Not only does it have a super fresh gel consistency, it feels lightweight on the skin while providing ample hydration and balancing my skin tone and oil levels. This gel cream feels amazing on the skin, cool and soothing, and sinks into the skin like a dream leaving it soft, hydrated and plump. It is formulated to repair the skin's moisture barrier while delivering long-term hydration. The addition of niacinamide is genius as it aids in absorbing excess oil and minimizing pore appearance. The cream itself has a very light scent and comes packaged in an eco-friendly airless pump container that can be refilled for reduced waste. I absolutely love this kind of packaging and find it not only convenient, but also helping in product usage as it dispenses just the right amount for application. I've only been using for a fairly short time, but I am truly loving how this product feels and even more so, how my skin looks and feels after applying for daytime use. Plump, hydrated, but not greasy or oily, staying moisturized throughout the day, but without feeling oily even with makeup applied and worn all day long."

I like that it contains no fragrance just scent from whatever ingredients they use. I like the refillable packaging but can we please have the outer jar made with glass? I think it wouldn't be a problem since the main working component is the plastic pump & refillable jar inside of it.  The pump gives me the right amount for each use. The lotion is a slightly thicker gel than i expected. It goes on smooth & gives me a few minutes to massage it in till it completely dries. It soaks really well and it doesn't leave a film on my skin and it is moisturized. My skin feels smooth like there is no product applied. After 1 week of use, I didn't experience any itchy skin or allergic reaction only 2 pimples. I do feel that my skin is moisterized, pumper & soft. So far I only use it at night and it does a good job keeping me hydrated without feeling so oily when I wake up. Maybe i'll switch it to the morning since it's lightweight."

Even though I have dry skin, I actually prefer this over the Triple-Lipid Peptide Cream. It's very silky with a light sheen finish. It does have a little bounce back to it and can peel so just be cautious of that. It refines texture and plumps the pores for sure. I really like the glow it gives and see myself wearing this.

The SkinFix Restoring Gel Cream is seriously amazing. I saw real, noticeable results after just one use. When I was in cosmetology school, they taught us that taking care of your skin barrier is the ultimate key to having great skin. This product really lives up to its promise of restoring the skin barrier. The winter months has my skin super dry, sometimes red and itchy, and it's in constant need of some extra TLC. With this cold weather wreaking havoc on my skin, this product has been a lifesaver.  When I found out that this product was specifically designed to help restore the skin barrier, I was over the moon to give it a try. And boy, did it exceed my expectations! I've found that my favorite skincare products are usually gel-like in consistency, just like this one. I love how it absorbs into my skin, actually making me feel like it's doing its thing. The pump jar is so convenient and gives me just the right amount for my face and neck with a single pump & the hygienic aspects speak for themselves.  Once I applied it to my face, I immediately felt a refreshing and cooling sensation. It hydrated my skin instantly, giving it the love it desperately needed. It doesn't leave my skin feeling greasy or like I have a ton of product on my face. It's lightweight, but it definitely delivers great results. I've noticed that my skin looks less oily, but at the same time more glowy and healthy. I'm absolutely in love with the ingredients, the fact that it's fragrance-free, and how it makes my skin feel smooth and youthful. This product truly does what it claims. I'm incredibly impressed with its quality, and I can't wait to explore the other amazing products in the SkinFix line. Iu2019d love if this product was available in a body-sized quantity because my dry, itchy winter legs are jealous."

My dry skin can range from dehydrated to flaky pretty frequently in the winter which gets pretty frustrating.  I've used this gel cream for 5 days morning and night. I adore the thoughtfulness to packaging as my hands have neuropathy so the pump style makes it so easy to press. I love how the gel feels on my skin, it's not quite what I imagined a gel/cream to be.   My skin drank it up almost instantly without being heavy. I'm a sucker for a good niacinamide as it brightens, reduces oil in my oily zone(sides of nostrils) I've also noticed a reduction of redness. My winter skin craves Camellia Siness(green tea seed oil) which is another great ingredient for the perfect hydration! Thank you SkinFix for your high standards when it comes to not adding additional fragrance!!"

For reference I have dry, sensitive skin with fine lines/wrinkles and occasional hormonal breakouts. I also happen to live in a cruelly hot and dry desert that makes matters worse.    Skinfix's nourishing hydrator contains squalane, jojoba & macadamia oils, niacinamide, squalene, hyaluronic acid, folic acid, folic acid and peptide-lipid complex.    The texture is fresh, lightweight and cloudy-dreamy. I really appreciate that there's no added fragrance as parfum can aggravate my sensitive skin.    Would very highly recommend it for people with oily/combination/acne-prone skin or for summertime use in hot/humid weather. Layers well under makeup, no pilling, no tackiness, absorbed fast and seamlessly.    Sadly my skin doesn't take to niacinamide well and since this ingredient is pretty high up on the list, I had to discontinue use. If you're not sensitive to any of the ingredients and looking for an all-around amazing lightweight moisturizer that can be used in skin-cycling and is vegan + cruelty-free, please consider giving Skinfix Barrier+ a try.

I look forward to using this product in the summer time when my skin is more combination/oily than it is now. I think this moisturizer is good to use in the morning or at night.

Unlike many heavier barrier support products, this lightweight formula sinks right into the skin, leaving no greasy or sticky residue behind.  Barrier support is important for all skin types, as many factors, like pollution, over-exfoliation, stress, and harsh weather, can weaken this barrier, leaving the skin more susceptible to dryness, sensitivity, irritation, and even acne.  As someone with acne-prone skin, I want to protect and strengthen my skin barrier, but many heavier products break me out.  With Skinfix Barrier Restoring Gel Cream, I finally have a suitable product to shield and safeguard my skin without adding to any concerns around breakouts.

I love the pump format of the dispenser that the Skin Barrier Restoring Gel Cream comes in.  I have tried several gel creams over time but this one stands out for me.  The gel cream from Skinfix is not as watery as I am accustomed to seeing in other gel creams.  This cream really absorbs well into my skin and provides better soothing benefits than others I have tried.  This cream is unscented.  This cream is one that I would incorporate in my AM and PM skincare routines year round.  I particularly enjoy how this makes my dry, winter skin feel so soothed."

This cream absolutely deserves praise is its ability to restore and maintain the skin's natural barrier.   I had been using a harsh cleanser/treatment for acne prior to starting this product.  My skin was so inflamed, red, and irritated from it.  Day one of using SkinFix barrier I noticed the inflammation and irritation disappearing.  With only a handful of days in, one pump in the morning and one pump at night, my skin has made a complete 180 to beautifully hydrated and calm skin.   I would absolutely recommend SkinFix to anyone who needs to restore and maintain their skins barrier.  For the price point, I feel like the cost is way less than the product is worth!

My face felt instantly hydrated and moist following application, and the feeling lasted through my work day.  Having said that, in the future, I would probably use this more in warmer months, as I wanted something more deeply nourishing in the dry air of winter (both the cold, blustery weather outside and the dry heat inside).  I think it was a fantastic gel cream; I just like to use something even more nourishing in this season.  Also, I love skincare that comes with a pump in the top!

Within hours my redness and the blemishes that were appearing had completely gone away. There was also a night in the shower that I believe the hot steam from the shower caused a flare up and was damaging to my skin barrier. I continued to use the skin fix gel cream and there are no signs of any damage to my barrier. I love that this product is vegan and cruelty free. The texture of the gel cream is so lightweight. Right after the application process  my skin absorbs the cream and my appearance is a glossy glow. I have never been able to achieve the skin glass look and my skin has never been so healthy. Skinfix gel cream has truly embraced both of my problems. The look and health status of my skin is top tier. The box detail is a perfect size and clear detail. The details provided are expectations , ingredients and skin nerd appealing information. I have the unique refill container. The container is a twist on seal and has a pump. Simply making it easy to use and keeping the product safe. Keeping the product safe and limiting outside access reduces the chance of cross contamination in any sort. This limits anything else possibly being put on your face other then the skinfix product. I absolutely love this feature as an esthetician and slight germaphobe. All around this product is five out of five. If there was a higher rating scale I would max my rating out, seriously this product works wonders. I would very highly recommend this gel cream to be used to fix any skin issue that needs fixing. Skin love and care was made in this gel cream by skinfix and I believe everybody needs this.

My guess is this formulation has some ingredients that help keep this gel cream, light and airy. In fact, itu2019s probably these ingredients that make this gel great for those prone to acne and excess oil. This gel cream wore on throughout the day and kept my skin really comfortable, but I would say it didnu2019t feel as indulgent or protective as I usually like for my 41-year-old skin.

I have dull dry skin with early signs of aging. What I have learned is some of these changes I am noticing can be exasperated by a compromised skin barrier. This is where skinfix barrier + restoring gel cream came to the rescue. The gel is made with sensitive skin in mind, so you wonu2019t have to worry about irritants like fragrance. It is noncomedogenic and it has a simple pump to control the amount you use! I cleaned my face with a simple cleanser and put on the gel cream. Wow, what a difference! The product is super lightweight, and my skin drank it right up. In the summer, this will be my go-to! If you live in a warmer climate it can be your moisturizer on its own. I put this on for seven days and my skin felt soft and hydrated, and it never once broke out in acne! I was impressed that a little goes a long way so I wonu2019t have to break the bank to give my skin the nutrients it needs. I would highly recommend this product to anyone who struggles with acne, blemishes, or even oily skin because it is so lightweight and nutrient-rich!"

I like that this gel cream is vegan and designed for all skin types and safe for sensitive and/or acne-prone skin. It is non-comedogenic, and packed with niacinamide and antimicrobial peptides to help keep skin clear, even tone, refine pore size, and protect the skin barrier. After the first week using this cream, my skin was noticeably healthier, brighter, more hydrated, and fine lines are now far less visible. I highly recommend this gel cream for a hydrating boost for all skin types."

I love the soft consistency and how easy it is to apply. It is worth mentioning that this cream has no aroma.

It feels silky, it doesn't have any residue left on your skin and your skin will feel refreshed especially after a long hard day at work. This is definitely something you want to use in the morning and at night so that your skin can get started for the day and also recover for the day  this product goes well with any of the skin fix products you can mix a match and use them together. There is no smell no odor no sensitivity doesn't cause rashes. I use my skin fix gel cream in the morning and at night and I use it also with the barrier cream , I do this to ensure that my skin is recovering from the long difficult day and cleansing from my make up ! What I also love about this product is the pump the pump makes this product so easy to use it allows you to control the consistency and how much are using I only used one pump and that was it which is a huge savings on your facial creams"

However, Skinfix's Skin Barrier Restoring Gel Cream proved me otherwise. This gel cream formula is lightweight yet rich im texture and not too thin for my skin. My skin felt deeply nourished with just a little bit of product!! I love that it's not only water based. It leaves my skin Barrier feeling and looking healthy and strong. It's also unscented. If this worked wonderfully for my skin, I know for sure it would benefit those with oily skin or acne prone skin as well, especially since it's noncomedogenic. As a beauty influencer for many years, I would recommend to anyone!"

Not only does it hydrate effectively, but it also doesn't clog my pores or aggravate my acne-prone areas. Instead, it soothes and nourishes, leaving my skin feeling rejuvenated and resilient. What truly sets this gel cream apart is its impeccable performance as a barrier cream. Applying it before my makeup has become a non-negotiable step in my routine. It creates a smooth canvas for foundation, enhancing its application and ensuring it lasts throughout the day."

            "review_text": "This gel cream is the perfect alternative to the original Skinfix Triple Lipid Peptide cream. This one is perfect for those with oily, acne-prone, troubled, or irritated skin because it has a light, jelly consistency. The ingredients of this include the patented BL3 complex, which is composed of healthy fatty acids that help to improve the skin barrier. This also contains saccharide isomerate, which helps strengthen the skin barrier. Additionally, this has niacinamide to help even the skin tone, absorb excess oil, brighten the skin, and refine the appearance of pores. This also has zinc PCA which controls the sebum production of the skin and helps in reducing redness. Like the original triple lipid cream, this water-based cream comes in light green packaging and can dispense the product easily through its refillable container and pump. I like that this is nonscented, and does not add extra shine or heaviness to my already oily skin. I love using this every day, which gives enough hydration to my skin without the need for reapplication; however, for winter days, I prefer to use the original lipid peptide cream. I plan to use more of this product in the summer when my skin requires less heavy cream and less hydration. I find that this product layers well with my favorite cream and powder foundation and does not cause any interaction. This product helps not only in restoring my skin barrier health, but also prevents future breakouts and helps to fade acne scars due to the niacinamide and zinc ingredients. I also love that this seems to reduce the appearance of my pore size, and also seems to reduce the occurrence of blackheads and whiteheads, which has been a constant struggle with my skin. This is also a good daytime cream not only for those struggling with acne-prone skin, but also for those with sensitive skin. That is because this product is allergy-tested and is made to harmonize with the skin's natural pH. This is also non-comedogenic, vegan, and cruelty-free. I"

Though the product is not scented it does have a slightly medicinal smell to it, itu2019s not off putting though. The jar has a pump that is very nice as it allows for a more hygienic application.

I like to use this in my morning routine. This has a similar nutty scent to the Barrier+ Triple Lipid-Peptide Face Cream. The texture is lighter, but still pretty creamy and absorbs easily. I find it sufficiently hydrating, and sits well under makeup and never makes my sunscreen pill."

My skin type is dry with concerns of aging, hyperpigmentation, and dull sagging skin. This is my first time trying Skinfix Skin Barrier Restoring Gel Cream which has been a great miracle, lightweight, richly hydrating gel face cream that works very well for all skin types especially for people with acne prone skin, large pores, sensitive, and super oily skin. This is a lightweight moisturizer but packed full of skincare science using ingredients like saccharide isomerate, niacinamide, heptapeptides and zinc PCA which nourish the skin barrier, help brighten skin tone, shrink appearance of pores, and absorb excess oil. The Skinfix Skin Barrier Restoring Gel Cream felt so light on my skin with a gel texture but then quickly absorbed into my skin flawlessly! I mostly applied this face cream to face and neck after washing my face in the morning. I applied one to two pumps of the gel cream before applying face sunscreen, makeup, and other products. This face cream didnu2019t clog my pores or irritate my skin, and it left my face baby smooth with quenching hydration!  I loved that this cream didnu2019t have a strong fragrance or irritating strong scent! Skinfix Skin Barrier Restoring Gel Cream is a cruelty and vegan face cream with clean ingredients made with no harsh ingredients free from parabens, phthalates, and petrolatum! This gentle face cream pairs wells with other products from Skinfix such as the 2% BHA Cleanser (for acne) and the Resurface+ AHA/BHA Niacinamide Exfoliating Pads. I definitely recommend the Skinfix Skin Barrier Restoring Gel Cream especially for people who have a hard time finding a face moisturizer that wonu2019t flare their skin up or make their current skin condition worse such as acne while still hydrating skin!"

I tap over my skin with my fingertips until the gel cream is fully absorbed. This cream has a silky, smooth lightweight texture that absorbs rather quickly into my dry to combination skin without leaving my skin feeling sticky or greasy. It hydrates and soothes my combination to dry skin on application and it keeps my skin looking matte and clear by absorbing excess oil. This is a beautiful cream with long-lasting moisturizing and skin barrier support benefits that is perfect for my skin. I highly recommend this gel cream!"

After using this product for a few days, I noticed my skin is now very hydrated in appearance and touch with the use of this product. The texture of this product is a plus! Not heavy weight or greasy but still moisturizing. I have a glow immediately after I apply this product and the glow lasts for hours!"
