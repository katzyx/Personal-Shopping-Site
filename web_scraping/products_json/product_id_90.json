I dabbed some of the serum under my eyes and poured the rest onto the patches.  When I put the patches on the serum dripped down my face, along with the patches themselves.  Within about 10 seconds the patches were half way down my face.  I kept sliding them back up until finally after a few minutes they decided to sort of stay put.  I felt some kind of sensation from the formula, almost a slight stinging sensation.  Maybe that means its doing something?  I'm not sure, but I will absolutely never use these again because the experience was just so bad."

Additionally, though there is a ton of liquid in the packet, these masks don't actually seem to hold onto the serum, making it pointless to apply them in the first place. I have not noticed any visible changes to my undereyes (in either appearance or texture) after using this product. It's a waste of money, in my opinion."

It looks like someone photoshopped my eyes- that's how amazingly these worked for me.  I'm a contact tracer, and needless to say I've been busy lately.  Today was the first day off I've had in several weeks.  I'd actually purchased these weeks ago, but haven't found the time to use them- probably during a time when I needed them the most. My eyes have been very puffy, dry, and all-around dull.  The skin around my eyes looked thin and frail.  But these eye masks really brought my eyes back to life- I'm truly astounded.  I should note, I'm relatively new to using eye masks- I've  previously only tried 2 other brands.  I (personally) found these to be far superior to the other ones I've tried- and they didn't irritate the sensitive skin around my eyes.  After using them once, there were no more lines, and the puffiness was gone.  I kept looking in the mirror because I couldn't believe the results were real.  I'm so happy with the outcome, and wholeheartedly recommend this product for others with the same skincare concerns."

I would say this product is ok for people who donu2019t have a severe case of under eye puffiness or dark circles, it does feel hydrated and a bit lighter right after using but as I mentioned before it will go back to normal within a few hours.

I feel it did take down puffiness,  not completely but noticeably,  and made eyes seem brighter.

I was particularly tired the day I first used them and felt instantly soothed. Almost felt a bit tingly for a moment. Now the important part, my results.

I use them in the morning before work, and they do make my eyes feel more refreshed, and the bags go down significantly. Although, I do see a return of the bags a few hours later.  So far the aesthetic lasts for a few hours.  I have only been using them for about a week, I will continue to use them for the 15 days to see if there will be any improvement on lasting effectiveness.  I would recommend them for two reasons. First, how they donu2019t bother my eyes. Second, they do give my eyes a feeling of being refreshed."

My eyes looked refreshed and the normal morning puffiness was dramatically reduced after my first application. I really am impressed at how effective they are in reducing my morning eye puffiness. After several additional applications, the skin under my eyes looking brighter, just as the name properly claims. These gels have now become part of my morning routine and help me feel confident in my appearance when I leave my home in the morning."

You do have to use them longer than they say to see it happen though. Although once youu2019ve had enough on your eyes, you can flip them down to the sides of your mouth and use the remaining serum from them. I canu2019t get over how cool these feel. Even an hour later they will still feel cool to the touch. Not terrible value either considering you get 15 individually wrapped pairs.

Without exaggeration, I can honestly say that Iu2019ve tried most eye patch masks on the market. Most are just ok, and these are no exception. They look awfully pretty, I loved the silver pearlescent look, and they were nice and cool and relaxing while on. I found that they did slip a little, as most do. I left them on for about two hours, until they turned completely shriveled and dry. I used 4 packets over the course of a holiday week, and while I enjoyed having them on and they didnu2019t cause any unpleasant side effects, they really arenu2019t anything special. They didnu2019t really de-puff at all, and they certainly didnu2019t brighten my eye area. I think itu2019s worth noting that every single one of the first (and at this moment,only) 10 reviews on here are absolutely fake, made by the company. Every reviewer has only ever reviewed BeautyBio products, all just signed up, and not a single one has reviewed anything else. I find that the company decided to do that so off-putting. There are so many new companies, or well established brands that are just launching at Sephora, that do not use fake reviews to bolster their credibility, and I think it speaks volumes about the integrity of the brand as a whole. That being said, if these knocked my socks off I would be willing to look the other way about this tacky tactic, but these are really just nothing to write home about. The Peter Thomas Roth ones are way better, at a much better value"

I also like how this can be applied to more than just your under eyes making it a perfect beauty hack!   Tips: (1) stick this in the fridge for some added coolness and relaxation, (2) you can use a jade roller on the area after removing the patch for extra absorption into the skin, (3)you can also get some extra product from the film wrapper to apply on other areas where the patch was not applied."
