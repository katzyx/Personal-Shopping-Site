This concealer completely covers my dark circles. I have genetically dark circles and bad insomnia, which is a recipe for some gnarly under-eyes. Despite this, this concealer covers my under eyes, active acne, and post-acne marks. Also, I bought this concealer back on June 6th, 2024, and it's still going strong!"

The Sephora sale happened, and I caved and bought it. I color matched on my own and I was SHOOK with the outcome. The formulation makes your skin look smooth like butter. I just swipe a small line on both cheeks and blend with the Saie big brush (highly recommend) and it blends like a dream. A little goes a long way! It's so lightweight, that I can't even tell it's on. Where has this been on my acne journey. I highly recommend this concealer with my whole heart. My hormonal acne friends give it a try, you won't regret it. The ONLY flaw is the tubing leaks easily with too much product coming out at once."

But there are caveats. For me, I use an eye serum and cream. Then I have to use a blurring type primer to fill my fine lines. Sometimes Iu2019ll set that with setting spray, tapping into the under eye to seal and make a smooth canvas. If I do all that, this can leave a smooth, concealed long wearing result. However, if I donu2019t, it ages me. If youu2019re able or willing to put in the effort, itu2019s great. Some days I canu2019t be bothered with a product that can be a bit finicky. If you donu2019t have mature under eyes, this is great. Works great on the rest of the face. Self setting for me. Use the smallest amount too"

It does dry down fairly quickly so have your brush, finger or blender ready to go to work. I applied this as I would for everyday use. That means no primer and no setting spray. After several hours the concealer was still brightening the dark circles underneath my eyes. I experienced very minimal creasing. Hourglass offers a wide variety of shades which means they can be used as concealer, highlighter, contour, color corrector and more. The color that I used is- Creme.I was pretty happy with the color match. This liquid formula is waterproof, cruelty free, vegan and offers up to 16 hours of brightening wear. The microspherical powders brighten and blur imperfections  and diminishes fine lines and wrinkles. Conceal the appearance of dark circles and blemishes to give your skin and natural airbrush look. There is very minimal fragrance and I did not find this to be irritating to my eyes at all. I used a slanted fluffy concealer brush to apply the Hourglass concealer. I smiled and then gently applied in the areas that needed the most brightening while also ensuring not to over apply the concealer into my fine lines. If the product performs this well without primer and setting spray do I really even need those products? Probably not. I can only imagine the extra steps may help it perform even better. Overall, I am very happy with this concealer and I recommend it."

The shade match is pretty spot on (I am fair with neutral undertones, and Birch 1 works good on me), however the formula itself is not for me - this concealer is a little too thick and creamy for my liking, and tends to crease on me within the first hour. It also does not seem to hold up with powder on top due to the sickness of the formula. You can make it look good if you are extremely cautious about the amount you are using - less is truly more with this product. Overall, not terrible but not great either, I would only recommend this product to people with no pronounced fine lines and wrinkles"

I selected the shade Creme - 1.5 because it is recommended for fair skin with pink undertones, and that describes my skin exactly. In hindsight, I should have gone for their shade Birch - 1 for fair skin with neutral undertones because in online product shots it seems just a tad bit lighter. My skin is so porcelain it is almost translucent and Creme ended up being just a smidge too dark, even when well-blended. It also ended up being too yellow for my skintone as well. Unfortunately that did not balance out the dark circles under my eyes. It actually enhanced them.  I also felt the formula dried a little too dry for my combination skin. I feel like it enhanced the fine lines and small wrinkles rather than, well, conceal them. With this formula less is also definitely more. It's a creamy consistency but did not dry down that way on me and creased fairly quickly on my GenX skin. I think I may try it with a more dewy concealer I have that's much lighter and see how they blend. But on its own, this one is a pass for me. Your mileage may vary, however, as this is an extremely popular product and is well-reviewed. If you're a bit younger and have skin that trends more oily-combination than dry-combination, it should work very well for you!"

I used the given applicator to apply to my face and felt it dispensed a good amount of product without being too much. I then used my finger, a brush and a beauty sponge on different days, and each blended well without issue. This concealer provided pretty decent coverage on its own, but I did like this with an added color corrector. I set this with setting spray and powder, but also tried without setting, and thought it worked well both ways as it did not crease or settle into fine lines. After eight hours of wear, this still looks good on my skin. I have a slight tan at the moment, and would consider myself to be a light neutral and the shade I used was Silk, which matches my skin tone well. I think this is a nice option for concealers and would purchase in the future."

When I first opened it, I was immediately impressed with the large applicator sponge and the high end look of the packaging. I chose the color Birch which is for people with fair skin with neutral undertones. As you can see I am VERY fair skinned leading me to struggle to find color matches for concealer. At first I was afraid the color would be too yellow for me, especially after trying it on my hand and wrist. Once I applied it to my hereditary under eye circles, I was pleasantly surprised at the match and how well it covered them. I found it to be long wearing with minimal creasing. It is thick - a little goes a LONG way so itu2019s important to not over do it as I could see it being very cakey if too much is used. I often use a color corrector under concealer but with this, I found that wasnu2019t necessary. Huge time saver for me! It does get a bit messy around the top of the container but I made sure to wipe it after each use."

I am still able to use it to highlight around my eyes but I do need to use it sparingly and with skill. Definitely go a shade or two darker than you think but honestly I would most strongly suggest swatching it in store to find whatu2019s really good for you since I do not know how the darker shades vary. The formula itself is good. Itu2019s very thick which is useful for covering blemishes or dark circles. I found it was very easy to blend too. I thought this thicker formula would be more likely to crease but actually it did not crease at all for me. This is a good one to consider, just make sure you get the right shade. In the photos I have a swatch and also a makeup look with the concealer applied on the left side of the photo on my undereye with no concealer on the right side."

The formula is buildable, allowing for more coverage without looking cakey or heavy, making it versatile for different makeup looks. It stays put throughout the day without fading or shifting, which is perfect for long days or special occasions. The shade range is quite extensive, catering to a variety of skin tones and undertones. I chose the shade Dlax and itu2019s perfect for my olive skin. This is, however, it's on the pricier side compared to other concealers on the market, so whether it's worth the investment depends on your budget and how much you value high-quality makeup. The packaging, while sleek, can be a bit tricky to use, as the doe-foot applicator is great, but it can be difficult to get the right amount of product out of the tube. Overall, the Hourglass Vanish Airbrush Concealer is a high-performance product that delivers on its promises.

I was worried it be too dark, but it was a spot on match!  Let me tell you that this is my new favorite concealer! It feels so lightweight on the skin, you forget you have concealer on. It instantly concealed any blemish, pores, and fine lines. A little goes a long way, so you only need a few dots under your eyes to see how good this is. I do use it also on my nose and if I have any blemish. It didnu2019t dry out my skin like many concealers do, and it truly lasted all day with no touch ups needed! I love that this is waterproof, vegan, and cruelty-free also. This concealer has a great applicator that glides easily, and holds the right amount of product. I personally always set my concealer with powder after for added security. It is a little pricey at $36 for the full size, but it will last you awhile, and is worth it! I will continue to buy this product because it gives me the best crease-free/all-day coverage, that looks stunning!"

Attempting to cover up red and inflamed pimples definitely wasn't the best. it soaked in and creased/looked wrinkly around the edges. Overall, it is a good concealer and I think this is decent. Another reason I decided to give it 4 stars was because of the price. I think this is a very high price for such a small product."

What really sets it apart, though, is the natural finish. It blends into the skin beautifully, giving you that soft, airbrushed look without any cakiness. The creamy texture makes it super easy to apply, whether you prefer using your fingers or a brush. Plus, you can build it up to get just the coverage you wantu2014no need to worry about it looking heavy.  Another highlight is how crease-resistant it is. A lot of concealers settle into fine lines, but not this one. It stays smooth all day, which is a huge plus if youu2019re concerned about aging or just want to look fresh.  Overall, the Hourglass Airbrush Concealer is a must-try if you want a reliable, natural-looking concealer that lasts. Itu2019s perfect for anyone who wants to look their best without a lot of fuss!"

On the bright side, it's extremely easy to take off! But if you need it to withstand water at all (hello, rainy seattle) this stuff is a hard no.   I was so excited to have found a product that almost exactly matched my throat/chest, so I was using this concealer more as an all over the face product. But as a girl who wears make up to dance (it gets REAL sweaty) and is also getting over a broken heart, I very quickly learned this formula can't withstand any kind of water/moisture.

I bought the mini originally (I donu2019t really recommend that though cause itu2019s very small for the price) and the moment I finished I purchased the full size.It is actually full coverage- not one of those false marketing statements. Itu2019s very creamy, goes on smooth; I find application is smoothest with  your fingers. I would recommend using a moisturizer under it though, it can sometimes cling to dry patches, but it works great on both parts of my combination skin and stays on even with sweat or oil. If you can get over the price, itu2019s definitely a great choice!"
