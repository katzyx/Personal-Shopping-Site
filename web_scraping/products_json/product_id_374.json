    "about": "Fragrance Family:Warm & Spicy.Scent Type:Warm and Sweet Gourmand.Key Notes:Amber, Jasmine, Peach, Vanilla.Fragrance Description:Sensuous and timeless, The One Eau de Parfum is the essence of the DOLCE&GABBANA woman. This floral fragrance combines contemporary fruit ingredients with the perfumeru2018s classic palette of white flowers. The scent opens with sparkling bergamot and mandarin blended with notes of lychee and peach. Heart notes of Madonna lily express a voluptuous intensity and enveloping femininity followed by the seductive dry-down of vanilla, amber, and musk.",
    "ingredients": "Alcohol, Fragrance, Water, Benzyl Salicylate, Limonene, Hexyl Cinnamal, Geraniol, Linalool, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Citronellol, Hydroxycitronellal, Benzyl Benzoate, Citral, Isoeugenol, Benzyl Cinnamate, Bht, Ci 15985 (Yellow 6), Ci 14700 (Red 4), Ci 19140 (Yellow 5).",
    "how_to_use": "Suggested Usage:.-Fragrance is intensified by the warmth of your own body. Apply in the creases of your knees and elbows for a longer-lasting, stronger scent.&nbsp;.-After applying, avoid rubbing or dabbing skin. This breaks down the fragrance, causing it to wear off more quickly.&nbsp;.-If you prefer placing fragrance on your wrists, be sure to reapply after frequent hand-washing, as this tends to rinse off the scent.&nbsp;.-Replace fragrance after 12 months. Expired perfumes more than a year old lose the integrity of the original scent... Eau de Toilette or Eau de Parfum?: .The difference lies in the volume of perfume oil. While EDT contains five to nine percent, EDP contains more, usually eight to 14 percent. EDPs, therefore, last longer and smell more intense.",

Though I have found that the roller ball does last significantly longer than the spray bottles. Itu2019s worth it to me to keep buying because Iu2019ve grown attached to the scent, but there are many other similar scents for lower price points that last wayyyy longer."

None of my other perfumes make me feel like The One does. I feel, strong, professional, but surprisingly feminine and ethereal...like some kind of galactic high elf, if that makes sense... when i wear this. Basically, I feel like a woman who is actually adult-y (I'm told i don't look my age and my personality is a bit kooky) This is my most complimented fragrance by men. Women like it but I get complimented 3 or 4 times more by my male coworkers. Whether I'm wearing The One alone, or on top of another perfume, OR on top of a male fragrance, i ALWAYS receive at least one or two compliments on it.  Although it's not the most unique scent, or the strongest in my collection, there's just something about the sweet subtlety in this scent that really captivates my guy friends/coworkers, and me as well.  I read that fragrance is extremely personal, and based on what i smell on my own skin and what other people smell, I can safely say that this *luckily* works perfectly with my natural chemistry, which I'm so happy about. Most of my female coworkers splash on overly sweet or fruity scenes that stink up the break room for the first 2-5 minutes then completely disappear, and despite this, I'm the one who has become known for always smelling really good every day. I have no doubt that The One had a large chunk in that. Within a month or two of buying the smaller bottle, i went out and got the largest size as a back up. I know i will continue to wear this for a very, very long time."

It was a fragrance mainly composed of vanilla and pear. The One doesnu2019t contain pear, but the way the composition showcases the vanilla and peach gives it a very similar feel. To me this is the perfect perfume for someone who doesnu2019t like perfume. Itu2019s young and light, but also complex enough to ease someone into a more sophisticated sent. The One is definitely one of my all-time favorites, but since Iu2019m a basket of contradictions, so is Chanel No5 who Iu2019ve heard from many people that they are turned off by what they think smells too elderly in aldehydes, so donu2019t let what I said about it being a perfume for non-perfume lovers give you a bad idea of it.

I can still smell it on my scarf or on my skin after a full day of wear, but it is never over-the-top or headache-inducing.  At first I saved this perfume for special occasions such as date night, but I find myself gravitating towards it during the day too because it adds something special and makes me excited to start my day. It's especially perfect when paired with a cozy sweater during the fall and winter months because of the amber, plum, and vanilla notes.  What I love about this scent is that it is warm. It is the scent of a woman who is classy and polished, independent, but also warm, feminine, and nurturing. Definitely a grown-up woman, but not old lady. It makes an excellent signature scent."

Strong perfume reminds me of my grandmother, so I wouldn't consider myself a big perfume person. This one however is light, even if you accidentally spray a bit too much. My guy friends like it as well. One of my male colleagues (who would normally have perfume trigger his allergies) asked me what I was wearing because he liked the smell and wanted to have his fiancee try it out. My boyfriend also loves it, who mentioned that normally he associates perfume with little old ladies, but this one is fresh and youthful.

It just dries down to the general powdery sort of smell you get by walking through the cosmetics department of a department store combined with a musky sort of scent. This is so disappointing considering how wonderful the fragrance started out being. And after an hour and a half, the fragrance is gone completely (and I put a lot on.)

However, I have decided this is the perfect romantic scent and reserve it for special occasions... if I can muster the self control. Seriously, this makes you FEEL things in a sensual way.

Plus, I've noticed my daughter stealing a few spritzes here and there as well. This definitely is The One!"

While it is a more mature scent than say, Taylor Swift's perfume, it does not smell powdery or anything. I am 21 and don't think it's too mature for me, but it would also be appropriate for an older woman. It also doesn't fade too quickly like some perfumes. I had a sample size bottle which lasted a while. I recently purchased the rollerball and plan to bring it with me for a semester in Europe, so I hope the bottle lasts the entire semester. Perfect for both daily wear and going out. The scent is very classy and seems like something I won't tire of."

It's warm and sweet, not overpowering, and doesn't sting the nostrils even when first applied and most potent.

I love oriental fragrances, and this one has just enough sweetness to balance it out and make a very sexy, fall/winter scent.  It lasts all day on me with only a few dabs on my wrists and behind my ears.

To me this is an absolute classic fragrance. It is so soft and sexy while being warm and sophisticated and also a tiny bit fresh. I own many many fragrances and this is one of the ones that I believe every woman should have. It really seems to attract people, especialy men. I am always getting so many compliments on this from such a variety of people, from men to my mother (who is 56 and who never likes the same fragrances as me) to even some teenagers, this fragrance just seems to appeal to everyone. I really like the other fragrances in The One line, but this one is my favorite. Dolce & Gabbana create many wonderful things, but like I said before this is the one fragrance that I believe every woman should own."

The peach, litchi, and bergamot are what I detect the most and I absolutely love it. After an hour, the litchi still remains, but soft florals of jasmine and lily begin to poke through. It quickly evolves into a perfect balance of fruits and floral.  Because of the strong fruity floral scent, I started wondering why so many people said this was best worn in the fall/winter. I really thought that this was u201cthe oneu201d and that I could wear this daily as my signature scent, especially when the vanilla poked through the jasmine and lily after 2 hours of wear. I absolutely love vanilla, so I was very glad to detect its presence. It still smelled pretty light and soft, so I couldnu2019t understand why people were calling this u201cwarm.u201d  But then three hours after wearing this, the incredibly warm vanilla and amber broke all trace of the citrus and floral, and I finally understood why this would not be best for summer. I know I would feel suffocated by the strong vanilla if I wore this in the summer heat. The transformation of this perfume on my skin is very dramaticu2014it started off like summer citrus and floral, and then became winter vanilla and amber.  By the fourth hour, the amber was completely vanished and all I smelled was vanilla. Being such a vanilla fanatic, I was surprised that I was very put off by the vanilla. But it was extremely sweet to the point of nausea. Without the warmth of amber, the vanilla just smelled sticky. Whenever I would catch a whiff of this, I would almost gag because the vanilla was so strong and sticky sweet. I found myself purposely keeping my arms away from myself just so that I couldnu2019t smell the sugary, syrupy vanilla.  This has great longevity and sillage. It lasted well over 7 hours and could be detected by others without being obnoxious. If the vanilla werenu2019t so strong on me, I would absolutely wear this. I donu2019t consider this a mature scent, but itu2019s classy enough to make me feel confident and poised. Itu2019s also not overly glamorous and luxurious enough to be worn only for special occasions. It's best for fall/winter since it gets syrupy and warm. Also, I like how elegant and simple the bottle is. Although itu2019s not u201cThe Oneu201d for me, itu2019s worth trying if you like sweet scents."

The lasting power is about 8 hours when using a rollerball, which is what I bought. BUT I'm going to buy the gift set as soon as I can after the holidays.

            "review_text": "I love The One for the Fall and Winter months! It's a very warm and comforting fragrance. I really like that it's inoffensive but it still has the feminine sophistication of a successful working woman. The projection isn't too intense as it wears quite close to the skin. But when people give me hugs or sit really close to me, they tend to compliment me on how nice I smell.  Overall, The One is sweet, but definitely not syrupy. The opening notes are pleasant. I definitely smell the Peach, Lychee, and Madonna Lily notes the most. But my favorite part of this fragrance is the dry down; the vanilla is the dominating base note, though I still sense a hint of peachiness. I also smell a tad bit of amber--just enough to make this appropriate for mature (i.e. more experienced and confident) women without making it grandmothery. There is also a little bit of powderiness, but the powdery scent is very faint.  The fragrance itself lasts on me for at least 12 hours. No joke. Not only does The One cling to my skin long, but the base notes remain addictive. I know there are some perfumes that last long but change into a less pleasant scent, so I am pleased that The One does not do that.  I personally think this is a great winter fragrance for the confident, sophisticated, classy, and sexy woman. I'm glad that I finally found a sweet fragrance that does not conjure up images of obtuse teeny boppers."

The scent itself has staying power, but it's not overwhelming. I initially tried the rollerball before ultimately buying the perfume. A quick roll across either the wrists, the crease in your elbow(s), or the nape of the neck? You're all set. (Alternatively, for the perfume, I tend to put a single spray in my hair... and a light one behind the knee. The scent gets to waft across the entire body). Just aim to be light-handed with this perfume if you're less of the floral-loving type. I experimented once with an extra dab on the wrist with the rollerball and the scent became increasingly floral with the Madonna Lily and Jasmine. Personally, I'm INCREDIBLY drawn to the Bergamot, Peach and Amber encompassed in this fragrance, though the Vanilla definitely stands out with my skin chemistry as well. The floral aspects are just enough - not over the top.  This is a unique perfume. While I've smelled scents with somewhat similar notes, I can't recall a scent combination that has been quite as...intoxicating. The scent is modern, sophisticated, and really strikes me as something befitting a woman in her late 20's or early 30's who exudes confidence and class.  I adore this scent, honestly, and I can't recommend it enough."

The amber, which my skin loves, became super apparent once the perfume warmed to my skin. I have to say, although I love Shalimar, D&G's One is so much cleaner and simpler, just amber and vanilla, and is now my every-day perfume. I'll be getting the rollerball for my purse!"

The One is not the one for me, but it might be okay on someone else. it is a little metal or alcohol heavy for me. i wanted sexy and feminine. but i didn't find it to be either. it's on the cold side vs. warm which i personally am not a fan of in a parfum.  the bottle is very nice and i'm giving points for that. it has a nice grip and would look lovely on a dresser/counter. ultimately i tried to live with it and wanted to like it but ended up returning it in the end. a little bummed."

It cost more than I thought I should pay for a perfume. However, last week, I received a $15 reward card from Sephora and guess what the first thing was I decided to buy?? You got it -- I practically ran to Sephora and snagged myself a 1 oz. bottle of The One (parfum... because it lasts longer than toilette and contains less alcohol supposedly). It's now waiting for me under my Christmas tree... and I'm having a very hard time resisting it. Think I just may have to break down and open it for Christmas Eve. I can't explain the effect this perfume has on me. I instantly feel like my identity has been upgraded! It makes me feel posh and confident.

I like most of the ingredients with the exception of musk and Vetiver (?), but those are so well blended that I don't notice them. This isn't particularly heavy, but is more sensual and warm, and lasts a significant amount of time. If you're looking for an extremely sexy fragrance (per my husband) you might want to check this one out."

On me, the dry down definitely rings of musk, so if you hate musk you might want to skip this scent. I also get a bit of that 'powder' smell in the dry down...nothing like Chanel No. 5, but interesting nonetheless since I wasn't expecting it. When I bought it it had been awhile since I smelled the perfume in person. I spritzed it on and it wasn't what I remembered...and I actually wasn't fond of it immediately. But after about 20 minutes of it being on me, I fell in love with the scent again. This is now my signature scent and I get tons of compliments on it! Lasting power is moderate.

I would describe The One as a light oriental floral. It's a warm oriental scent but not heavy at all. I personally don't get much of the fruit ingredients except maybe the peach. I think the dominant ingredient is a creamy vanilla over a light amber and clean musk. Otherwise, the ingredients seem to blend into each other very well. This is a mature, sweet, and feminine fragrance. It's slightly heavy for daily summer use. I prefer wearing it during the evening. When I have it on, I find it irresistible.  I think you will like this is you enjoy scents like Narcisco Rodriguez for Her, Tom Ford Black Orchid, and Donna Karan Cashmere."

I am not big on the BIG FANCY named items because, let's face it,I just don't always have the luxury of spending that kind of money often. I must say though I really like scents a little lighter and softer in the summer, this is a good pick and in my opinion. I can't tell you how many tomes I get someone asking me what that wonderful perfume is your wearing. At least take a moment and have the sales people make you a sample to take with you. This way you can have it in your purse or bag to see for yourself without making a full purchase to see if its a good scent for you to."

I don't have it (but only because I'm a perfume addict and I need to wait a bit with all the money I've spent to get it, lol) but I've tried it and I could not stop smelling my wrist. Everyone who smelled it on me said it was gorgeous. I'd recommend giving it a try and I'm absolutely adding this to my menagerie as soon as humanly possible. It's The One for good reason. To be honest I was brought in by the beautiful ad campaign with Scarlett Johansson, it just seemed like it'd be a classy fragrance and less juvenile, but I never thought I'd love it this much. Soooo delicious but not sweet per se. Well it has a sweetness but it's far from gourmand. You won't smell like a kid on a sugar high in this. Try it. :)"

I can't really pick up on the other scents, but the combination is a winner. A lot of perfumes with vanilla remind me of air freshener or baking, but this perfume takes vanilla to the level of champagne, candlelight and kissing on top of the Eiffel Tower.
