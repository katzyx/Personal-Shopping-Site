            "review_text": "Not worth the price point considering it has silicones, which give the false appearance of looking healthy. Hair looks good for a day and then it reverts back to it's less pleasant state. Unfortunately I got this on december and haven't tried it until much later. Too late to return now. I had the false impression that it'd be more effective since it's very expensive."
