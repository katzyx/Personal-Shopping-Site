Because I have dehydrated skin did my normal skincare and this wore really nicely throughout the day! The colour was perfect, donu2019t go based on the colour in the bottle or a swatch. One applied onto the face the true colour comes through. Itu2019s nice lightweight with good coverage. Not heavy or cakey looking. I got 04w and got matched to 11n on the shade finder. So I wouldnu2019t trust that either. You might have to go in store and have it applied so you can find your right shade. Worth a try for sure!!"

I like this best with a serum underneath, and no setting powder. This is one of the few foundations I have that can go under the eyes as well. Do need to use a bit of concealer with this but not much. Smoothing over pores, self setting, looks hydrating. I have dry skin with rosacea and find this soothing. I am 1N2 estee lauder in winter and bought 01 which was too light. Mixed it with nars liquid bronzer. Looks great. Then purchased 03 which I can wear on it's own but it is quite peachy. My skin tone is fair light neutral. Most of the shades looked too orange or yellow. They need some neutral shades. I put the lightest Kosas setting powder over the 03 which lightened it, but killed the glow. Does not sit in or highlight pores, and applies best with fingers. Worth the price if you can find a shade."

            "review_text": "This will be my new daily, non-fancy foundation for my combination skin. I have slightly oil forehead and dry cheeks with some dry patches. This WILL cling to those dry patches, so either prep well or ensure you get an excellent shade match. I also have light-medium neutral-yellow or neutral-warm skin and found that I went with a lighter shade in this foundation than recommended because it is quite pigmented plus it slightly oxidizes. The best match I found was 04W even though the Shade Match told me I would be 11N. 04W is a tad light on me but the yellow pigments help blend it into my tone instead of washing me out. It's a neutral-yellow light shade that may also work for light yellow-olive. 07W was a close match for me also when first applied, but dried down to an overly warm and slightly darker shade than the rest of me. For other foundation matches, I am Estee Lauder Doublewear 2W1 and Armani Silk 4.5. I swatched 06C in-store and while it is a very pink tone, it also blended in OK just that I looked slightly tan. 8N may have also worked well for me but I did not try.  The best part of this foundation is that it feels very comfortable, lightweight, is self-setting/slightly mattifying but has a natural finish. The mineral pigments seem fine enough to also blend in well, not look cakey and mask-like. I don't like the pump because it spurts out a set amount of foundation but that's ok because it layers well, has a thin viscosity. It has no special blurring effect but that's fine with me."

I am olive skin and there are 2 shades in the tan section which is great!. I swore I was 17w because 22w ( I can tell on the model would pull red). The 17w looked nice and yellow so I ordered it online since stores do not have testers. Welp the 17w was too light on my skin but the undertone was perfect.  I ordered the 22w and I was correct, it pulls red on my skin once I blended it to my neck. I have to blend to my neck because of hyperpigmentation. Even pulling it down a bit on my neck you can see my actual undertone is different. I would have to put foundation all over my neck and I don't want to do that. I ended up putting a green powder on my neck to counteract the red. But the 22w (it is darker than my skin tone) does look nice on my face once I put concealer and powder. The foundation feels nice and wears nice. The price is great as well. it covers my hyperpigmentation very well.    Not sure if I will keep the 17w.. mixing the 17w and the 22w together would give me my perfect shade.....maybe I should try the 18w but I feel that would pull orange. Not sure if the 15 and 16 shades would be too light and pink since they are neutral shades. No stock or testers in store ."

By mixing these two neutral shades I experienced only slight oxidation by the end of the day and found that it wore phenomenally.  The foundation is for the most part self setting and with my dry skin never separated or faded on me throughout the day.  It offers medium to full coverage and I used about 1 pump of the shade 8N and 3/4 pump of 11 N to get a slightly darker more olive shade than the Nars light reflecting foundation in the shade Punjab."
