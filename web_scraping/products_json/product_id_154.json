I will say though my hair felt like it was being yanked when I got to the bottom, it wasn't gliding smoothly through my hair. It works great till I get to my ends then I start having problems. While the fan feature is great, I couldn't run the fan while straightening or curling my hair because the lights in my bathroom kept flickering. Now I don't know if it's because this tool requires too much electricity or something on my end. But I never had this happen with my other tools. It's a great product to try, but I just don't think it's for me and my hair type."

This is the answer! ud83dude0d  I love that this gives body to my hair and the airburst part prevents damage because it keeps its cool.   First use of it did not make my hair soft.. a little dry actually.  So the next time I used it, I made sure I only run it pass my hair maximum of 2 times. It helped.

Its very noisy and I dont feel any air coming out of the holes really. Its a nice thought of a feature but I just dont feel it works. My hair truly has never felt softer after styling though."

Once I watched a couple tutorials I started to get it down and the curls came out so cute! If you have short to medium hair this will curl your hair quickly and smoothly! If you have long hair like my daughter and myself its def works more as a styler to put some volume and curl to the ends. We also have naturally straight hair that rarely holds a curl so someone that has want to curly hair would benefit from this even more. Once I get the hang of it this will be what I use to style our hair every time. I attached a couple pics of me using it for the first time learning on my toddler daughters hair after she came inside from playing so its messy but you at least get the idea. When I dont want a full head of curls which I rarely want anyways, this will be my go to tool for us!"

Im pretty good when it comes to curling my own hair. However, boy was I humbled when it came to this tool! As a hair straightener, love it! As a hair curler, its something Im not use to. I can never get the hang of curling my hair with a straightener. I look forward to using this tool more so I can learn how to style my hair better with it. The fan/air feature is pretty cool as well! It keeps the tool nice and cool around the facial area. I just wish the heat plates were a tad bigger. Other than that, I really enjoyed it!"

It has different temperatures and also a cooling fan mode that works amazing for me because I was in a rush and I needed to cool down.  It took me 5 minutes to get the look I wanted."
