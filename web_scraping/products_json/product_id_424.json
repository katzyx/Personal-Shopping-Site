The past 2 months my eyes have gotten extremely puffy, scabby, itchy, dry, etc from the use of this glue. I came to the reviews to see if anyone else was experiencing this as well, and I noticed another person on here also used it for years and all of a sudden it caused irritation. I donu2019t think this is a coincidence, I wonder if they changed the formula or ingredients. My eye isnu2019t as bad right now cuz it has mainly cleared up, but both my eyes were puffy, then got dry, which then cracked from being so dry, then bled. It is painful"

The glue lasts for 2 weeks and is easy to apply. I think this glue could do a better job at keeping my eyelashes on than the eyelash glue my eyelash lady used to use on me. I wish to be buried with this lash glue, I praise the person who created a glue stronger than Dwayne the rock Johnson.

I always choose the clear varieties so I don't have to be quite so careful and precise with my application.  Like with the any adhesive, applying it and letting it get tacky is key, especially since this stuff is so watery.  I like the brush-on feature because I can control the amount much better and it does dry very clear.   I use this every day and I find it works well, with needing only an occasional touch-up here and there, which is another reason the brush is ideal.  Typically, for me, I apply it very early in the morning (6am) and it lasts until I go to bed (anytime after 10pm) without any problems.   There have even been times I've slept in my lashes and not had any areas where the lashes lifted.  This stuff is very sticky.  Getting it anywhere else, your eyelid, fingers, even the ends of my lashes (which I have done multiple times) can be a bit of a pain, but a small sacrifice for the convenience of the brush and durability."

If she loves it so much, why'd she only give it 4.8 and not a 5? Well, girl (or boy), let me tell you why... It can get gunky when you close it back up. So you have to really clean it to make sure you have a good seal around it, otherwise, the product will just dry up. It's not a big deal...

It's very easy to get the perfect amount on the lash band.. it doesn't look like much gets on there but it's just enough. I keep my lashes on for 12   hours every day and this glue does the job! When I used it the first time and after a long day I went to peel them off ( such a great feeling, am I right?) they were actually a little hard to peel off which is very good especially after wearing them all day. I've tried lots of different brands of lash glue and this is by far the best."

The formula does appear pretty runny, but all eyelash glues I've tried in the past were pretty runny, so I don't know if that's a sign or something but regardless, the lash glue worked pretty well. It wasn't heavy and it went onto the lash bands easily with the applicator. I had to take off a star because I found myself a bit sad after I applied my lashes and after a few tears the lashes started coming loose. I think it's a good sign that my lashes could be removed swiftly and painlessly when I wanted to remove them, just a bit concerned it may be too swiftly. Overall though, this lash glue does the job."

I go through phases where I stop wearing lashes for a few months and when I decide to start wearing them again I always struggle with applying them for a bit. This glue makes it so easy.   I was getting my makeup done at Sephora and the artist used this and told me NOT to wait 10-30 seconds after putting the glue on to apply the lash. She told me to do it right away. That's what I've been doing and I haven't had any problems with them staying.   To all the reviewers saying they couldn't get the lashes to stick with this glue, it's because you're waiting too long and you let the glue dry too much. I see some saying they wait 10 seconds and get good results. It works fine for me if I don't wait at all, it gives you a bit of time to make adjustments. Once you apply pressure though, they stick. Absolutely DO NOT wait 30 seconds though.   The one thing I don't like about this glue is it does leave behind some on your real lashes that is hard to get off. I just put a thick eye makeup remover on a clean lash comb and brush through a few times, which always does the trick."

For those who've had problems, I suggest fanning the lash for 10 seconds or so and then put it on.

However, you use less product, so one of these lasts me upwards of 6-8 months. I will continue to repurchase this product"

I typically wear falsies for up to 16 hours a day and the glue keeps them right in place. I apply the glue to the eyelashes and let them dry a little so the glue is tacky, then apply the false lashes to my eyelashes. The glue allows me to adjust the falsies if I need to because it takes a minute to completely dry. The glue doesn't clump and it's easy to build if need be. After the day is done, the falsies are easy to take off and the glue hasn't snagged any of my real eyelashes so I have no complaints.  I also wear contacts so my eyes are kind of sensitive, but the glue hasn't irritated my eyes at all. Hope this helps!"

The sales rep said this glue is one of their bestsellers due to the trusted high quality & it has less chemicals compared to the other 2 DUO lash adhesives. When I opened the bottle I was skeptical because it seemed very clear/runny & I felt the need to continuously brush on the product onto the lash strip since the consistency was very runny. I've used it for a few days & I must say this is my new go-to lash adhesive from now on. I like how the lash stayed on in my inner & outer corners of my eye which I always had difficulty keeping them in place all day. Also, I didn't notice a strong typical lash glue door which was also a bonus! The only negative thing I don't like is this tube only holds one third of the DUO squeeze tube versions but for the same price of $12. Then again, knowing it has less chemicals & gets the job done, $12 is a good investment."
