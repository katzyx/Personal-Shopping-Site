            "review_text": "So, I love this brand and I found the water drench, the blue pair, to be very effective as the entire water drainage line is. I noticed other comments are saying the Potent C (orange pair) didn't have as much serum on it, I do wonder if that's by design. I thought they were dry (drier than the blue) as well but after wearing them for 20 minutes my face was obviously being affected by the serum within the patches.  Hyaluronic acid needs quite a bit of liquid to draw moisture into the area, so I think, thinking that the vitamin C patches are dry and ineffective as a result is erroneous.  Mine weren't dry (as in crispy with no moisture) , they weren't AS wet or dripping wet as the hyaluronic pair.  I just took off the vitamin C patches moments ago, and I noticed a plump and youthful glow to my skin, yes, I am a real person lol I think for $5.50 each (11 for the pair). They are a pretty good deal, just my take!"

Both sets were completely dry!  There was zero moisture/product on a single one of them!  Maybe I received a bad batch, but I will definitely not be ordering more of these to find out!  If anyone does order them, I sincerely hope that you have a much better experience with these than I had, & a much better product than what I was sent!  Iu2019m still very surprised with how awful these are considering how amazing Peter Thomas Roth products are!"
