It would be nice if it came with a small bag to carry all of the scents since they're small and can be lost pretty easily."

Beach walk has a wonderful sunscreen undertone that I feel so many beach perfumes miss. And fireplace settles down to smell like youu2019ve been at a bonfire. I will be purchasing these for sure and possible others as well."

The fragrances leaned heavily toward florals, which felt more classic and matureu2014perhaps better suited for those who enjoy timeless, vintage-inspired scents. Personally, I found the selection to appeal more to an older generation, and none of the perfumes truly resonated with my style.  That said, scent is deeply personal, and I can see these working beautifully for someone with a love for florals or a preference for more sophisticated fragrances. If youu2019re curious, the sampler is a great way to explore without committing to a full bottle. Just not my vibe!"

The beach did smell a stereotypically beachy. The date smelled a bit similar but not as strong. The rain seemed floral. The autumn was lightly spicy, maybe cinnamon. Sailing seemed salty with a hint of musk. I think Jazz was the most lightly scented, like a thin musk. Lazy smelled kind of like peanut butter to me, maybe a scent from a kitchen. Bubble was pretty strong, but clean smelling. The fire was probably the strongest scent, it reminded me of vinegar bbq sauce. Lemon was my favorite, but it did seem more like a citrus blend."

The scents truly smell like what they are meant to be. For example, autumn vibes smell like a trip to the mountain during September where the leaves are changing colors and every step, you hear crunching from the floor. I was blown away by how accurately this scent was recreated.  2. My personal fave must be Lazy Sunday Morning. It evokes a feeling of sunlight seeping through the curtain of my bedroom. Laundry was just folded and thereu2019s a lingering scent remaining on my sheets. Truly so relaxing and fresh.  3. These small testers allow me to switch it up throughout the week, to match my mood, the event, and outfit.   Highly recommend this for anyone who wants to try new fragrance but donu2019t know where to start."

This would make a great gift for the holidays for any perfume lover. Itu2019s also an excellent bargain as you get 10 different fragrances. A wonderful way to test them out to decide which ones you want to get in a bigger size. Iu2019d highly recommend this set to others and will be back to get a few of these in bigger sizes!!"
