It is a gentle cleanser that thoroughly cleans the skin without stripping it or damaging its barrier. I love the fact that it has no significant scent because it assures me no extra fragrances were added. It foams a lot and a little bit definitely goes a super long way. I like the fact that it has a hole on the cap so you donu2019t have to struggle getting it open.

Using the Expert Ceramide + Ectoin Gentle Gel Cleanser didn't disappoint, it's a great gel like consistently that only takes a small amount to cleanse the entire face and neck, it doesn't foam or lather up which I personally prefer because that typically means the cleanser is full of sulfates which strip down the skin barrier leaving that tight itchy feeling, this cleanser absolutely does not do that, you can feel the gentleness yet at the same time the cleaning depth it gives. It easily removes makeup, dirt and grime leaving the skin feeling clean and refreshed yet still healthy. It's one of the best cleansers I've had the opportunity to try and could be used on a range of different skin types benefiting all of them."

I know the trend nowadays seems to encourage the use of harsh actives, but this cleanser is proof that most times, our skin will thrive when its basic needs are met. This formula includes ceramides and barrier focused ingredients that help to keep the skin healthy and balanced. Itu2019s very lightweight, non-stripping, and works into a nice lather that leaves my skin feeling fresh. I also love how this formula is effective without the addition of fillers such as fragrances and essential oils. Now, Iu2019m not crazy about the twist top to open the tube because I did experience some leakage which can be a bit of an annoyance. Overall, this would be a nice complement to anyoneu2019s skincare routine whose primary goal is to maintain the health of their skin without the use of harsh or abrasive ingredients."

I've come to really like and trust the Skinfix brand. So far, I've enjoyed all of their products! I like how this face wash is scent-free. I also tried washing my face while wearing waterproof mascara and it washed about 70% of it off. A little harder to get waterproof mascara off. I definitely recommend this for sensitive or dry skin, but it would work great for all skin types!"

It starts off as a gel but after massaging it into the face it develops into a nice foam wash. I personally love using this but I do like to double cleanse so I use this is my second cleanser.

It foams and lather so quickly and the bubbles are the best part. The feeling of the cleanser in my hands and faces brings out my inner child. It feels like I'm playing with slime or soap that's been left in water. It's cool to the touch and feels like a light massage when rubbing it on my faces.The only negative thing a see is that I do feel dry under my eyes after drying off my face. It could be my fault so I'm not gonna hold it against Skinfix. Overall I give it 4.5 stars."

It effortlessly removes every trace of makeup and SPF, even stubborn waterproof formulas, without requiring any harsh scrubbing or tugging. My skin feels incredibly clean and refreshed after each use.  What I appreciate most is its gentle yet effective formula. As someone with sensitive skin, I'm always cautious about trying new products, but this cleansing gel has been a game-changer for me. It's gentle enough to use daily without causing any irritation, yet powerful enough to thoroughly cleanse my skin.  Overall, I can't recommend this product enough. It has quickly become a staple in my skincare routine.  If you're looking for a gentle yet effective cleansing gel that leaves your skin feeling refreshed and makeup-free, look no further!"

Iu2019ve struggled with combination skin, dryness from tretinoin, and acne, and itu2019s been so hard to find a cleanser that does everything I need it to. What I usually look for in a cleanser is the ability to remove all of my makeup and spf without stripping my skin or clogging my pores. Bonus points if itu2019s able to remove even waterproof mascara! This cleanser checks all the boxes!  It lathers so luxuriously, I only need about a dime sized amount to get my whole face. Itu2019s not stripping or drying at all, it leaves me skin feeling so soft and nourished. It removes waterproof mascaras SO easily. No raccoon eyes, no having to rub my eyes forever or even use an oil-based remover beforehand. This stuff is amazing!  My only complaint is the packaging. It dispenses from the bottom of the cap, it doesnu2019t come off fully, instead you just twist it to open and twist back to close. The issue I have with that is that after I dispense the desired amount of product, there is always more that leaks out when I twist the cap closed. Itu2019s not a huge issue, but it would be nice to not have any leakage at all.  Overall an amazing product, Skinfix never fails to impress!   **This review was collected as part of a promotion."

I noticed when I used a makeup wipe after washing my face that there would be almost nothing left to come off which meant my face was nice and clean just with this cleanser. I also have always had dry skin and I like that this does not leave my face feeling as stretched, tight, and dry when I use it. I love that it is a gel form instead of foam so it is good for sensitive skin and that it does not have any fragrance. I would recommend this cleanser to anyone with dry skin."

One of the many reasons I love Skinfix products is because some, including this one, have the anti-contamination cap; as a germ-conscious person, this is very important to me. This gel-to-foam cleanser thoroughly cleanses the skin without stripping or over drying the skin barrier. I have sensitive, dry skin and have been able to use this cleanser daily for over a week. My skin looks and feels great with this cleanser. I like that it explicitly states it removes makeup and SPF. There are those rare nights where I am too tired to do a full nighttime double cleanse routine, and have chosen this cleanser because I trust this Skinfix product will do a great job at cleaning my face of SPF.  The only con with this cleanser is the cap. As previously stated, I am a fan of the hygienic dispenser but the cap leaks on my specific bottle. When I place the cleanser on the shelf, cap side down, as it is designed, a large amount of product leaks out. I double checked that it was securely closed, but no matter what I do, it still leaks."

I have been loving this in my nighttime routine because it leaves my skin feeling clean and refreshed after taking off my makeup for the day.

Its unique formulation transforms from a gentle gel to a luxurious foam, effortlessly removing all traces of grime and makeup without compromising the delicate balance of my skin. What sets it apart is not only its remarkable efficacy but also its commitment to being fragrance-free and crafted from clean ingredients, ensuring both human and environmental safety.

I will say it's a twist to open cap (it sits on its cap) and before I continue about the cleanser itself, I do want to warn you. It is very thin at first, so I recommend that you turn it upside down, twist it open, slowly turn it and dispense your desired amount of cleanser (I also recommend start with a little less than you think you need) then tip it back and twist it shut before cleaning your face. It will come out fast and when I laid it on its side a bunch did escape onto my counter. Take it from me, I accidentally wasted some on accident and bummed myself out! Before using Skinfix barrier+ my skin was tired, definitely on the dry side and all around just looked dull. Since using Skinfix barrier+ my face is softer, smoother, a little more plump and hydrated looking, and the best part is, the results last longer than previous cleansers I have tried! My  daughter  who has sensitive skin has also been using Skinfix. She has psoriasis and it's helped add hydration to her dry skin without causing her any itching or discomfort, which is amazing because usually she avoids washing her face. I am allergic to the sun and have to go outside for work so I'm constantly slathering thick sunscreen on my face to avoid hives, and I've been able to wash my face with Skinfix and not have to either scrub to get it off or wash my face more than once to get all the residue off. It comes off with regular washing and the first time which is AMAZING. It's definitely a lightweight smooth cleanser that foams up very nicely, and it has nothing added to it! No fragrance, phthalates, oils and it's even Gluten free so if your someone who suffers from a Gluten allergy or doesn't like Gluten this cleanser is safe for you! If your looking for your next cleanser without additives!"

I was super excited to have to chance to try the new SkinFix Ceramide Gentle Gel Cleanser because it seemed like everything I needed! First off, I love the packaging. Itu2019s super easy to use and I just feel like itu2019s more convenient than pump cleansers as gravity is working with you rather than against you.  This is a very thin liquidy formula that slightly foams after rubbing into the skin. I found that this worked super well as a second cleanse, however this stung my eyes and if I had any active pimples, it stung some of those too. Itu2019s mostly for this reason that Iu2019m not crazy impressed as I want to be able to use this everywhere I used an oil cleanser to ensure the oil gets washed away. After washing, my face feels nice, not tight and dry, but I wouldnu2019t say that I found a huge difference between this and other more hydrating cleansers.

The nearly doesn't have a smell, but when applied, I feel as if it has a slight plastic scent. Nothing too awful, as the scent is extremely light. It foams greater than many others I've tried, and doesn't require a lot of elbow grease to create the foam. Now, to preface, I have extremely dry skin. I've found that foaming cleansers tend to dry me out, and this one is no different. It's doesn't cause a terrible amount of dryness, I've found that it sticks to my dry patches and irritates them, even after 20 or so minutes of washing it off. I've let my husband use it, who has oily skin, and he's been enjoying it! He has no complaints of dry patches, and so I truly think this cleanser is best-fit for oily or combo skin.

It comes in a tube like bottle that twists open and closed- no extra cap on top. A little squeeze is all you need and extra product doesnu2019t leak out! Using it on my skin, my face felt nice and refreshed, no irritation whatsoever! It left my skin feeling clean and glowing!   The one small negative I have for this product is that the ingredient list isnu2019t on the bottle. I have a tendency to throw the outer packaging away without really paying attention to it, so I wouldu2019ve liked the ingredient list on the bottle itself.  Overall, I would definitely recommend Skinfix Ectoin + Ceramide Gentle Gel Cleanser to anyone looking for a gentle, refreshing cleanser"

Upon application to damp hands and face, it effortlessly transforms into a luxurious foam, gently enveloping the skin , leaving the complexion impeccably clean and refreshed.  What truly sets this gel cleanse apart is its ability to cleanse without causing any discomfort. Rather than leaving the skin feeling tight or stripped, it imparts a sense of softness, hydration, and suppleness. This is particularly noteworthy for individuals with dry skin like me.  The inclusion of key ingredients such as ceramide and ectoin further enhances its efficacy. Ceramide, known for its ability to strengthen the skin barrier, works to fortify and protect the skin against external aggressors. Meanwhile, ectoin, a powerful hydrating agent, helps to lock in moisture, ensuring that the skin remains plump and hydrated even after cleansing."

The cleanser is housed in an innovative squeeze tube packaging with a twist to unlock opening on the bottom.

This gel cleanser delicately removes impurities, oil, and makeup residue without stripping the skin of its natural moisture. I have super oily skin and I felt like my skin felt velvety smooth without being overly drying. The other benefits of this product include soothing and nourishing for the skin- which is how I felt. This product is gentle enough to use in all seasons without being too harsh. It's perfect for all skin types, including sensitive and acne-prone skin. The fragrance-free formula ensures a non-irritating cleanse without the worry of smelling something that has too much perfume scent as this one barely had any type of scent. Overall I recommend this product and its a wonderful addition to my skincare collection!"

If you're looking for a product that works well, this skinfix facail gel is a game changer. The cleansing power is also top-notch, it lathers well. It effectively removes dirt and sweat, leaving my skin feeling clean and refreshed without making my skin feel stripped or dry. It doesn't dry out my skin like some other facial cleansers I've used. The best part is that the scent isn't overpowering. It strikes the perfect balance between being noticeable and not overwhelming. Right now my favorite brand is skinfix because they offer a variety of products that legit work well and they're made with top quality ingredients."

Without stripping or damaging the skin barrier. It says its lightweight and it was really thin and runny. I didn't like the texture at all. It did foam up really good but you can't get it even close to your eyes at all. I didn't get it in my eye and it had my eye feeling like it was on fire. It did make my skin feel soft after using it but I don't think it hydrated my skin at all. I couldn't tell that it helped my skin texture at all. I really liked that it was vegan and cruelty-free. I also liked that it is made in the USA. This would have been a good product if it didn't burn your eyes while using it.

It comes in a tube container that features a twist top dispenser that I really wanted to love because it's unique and keeps things simple, but unfortunately, I can't store it in a standing up position as the product just leaks everywhere which makes me not love it so much. It has a gel texture that transforms into a soft foam when lathered with water and has no noticeable scent. It gently yet powerfully cleanses my skin of dirt, grime, and dead skin cells without stripping it of its natural oils. It has a very soothing formula that has an amazing way of keeping my skin calm while also keeping it moisturized and refreshed. It leaves my skin feeling super soft, and thanks to the wonderful ingredients inside it, it also keeps my skin barrier strong and healthy, especially when used with other products from the barrier+ line. Skinfix has been one of my absolute favorite brands since I first discovered them, and this new cleanser definitely ranks super high on my list of go-to products from them. Overall, this is a really great cleanser that is not only super gentle but is also very effective!"

As someone with combination skin prone to dryness, finding a cleanser that effectively removes impurities without stripping my skin has been a challenge. However, this cleanser has exceeded my expectations.  The gel-to-foam texture feels luxurious on the skin, providing a refreshing cleanse in the morning and effectively removing makeup, SPF, oil, and environmental pollutants in the evening. Despite its powerful cleansing abilities, it's remarkably gentle and doesn't leave my skin feeling tight or dry.  I love that it's pH-balanced and formulated with a patented B-L3 Complex, which helps repair the moisture barrier. The inclusion of Ectoin binds to lipids on the skin, ensuring they're protected during cleansing, while Chamomile soothes and calms any dryness or irritation.  After using this cleanser for a few weeks, I've noticed an improvement in my skin's texture and overall appearance. My pores seem more refined, and my skin feels softer and smoother. Plus, knowing that it's vegan, cruelty-free, and packaged sustainably gives me peace of mind.  Overall, I highly recommend the Skinfix Barrier+ Ceramide + Ectoin Hydrating Gentle Gel Cleanser to anyone looking for a gentle yet effective cleanser that respects the skin's natural barrier. It's become a staple in my skincare routine, and I'll definitely be repurchasing"

For instance, my nose (T-zone) is like an oil slick and most days, I felt that my makeup would just glide right off of my face. Many times, it did just that. Now, around my forehead and chin area, my skin is dry and tends to have noticeable spots where no amount of moisture looks as if it has ever been touched there. Knowing these areas of my skin, I try to choose products that will help in both situations! Skinfix's Ceramide + Ectoin Gentle Gel Cleanser is one of those products! It is directly targeted towards dry, dehydrated skin but oily skin also means that your skin is incredibly thirsty. The oil being produced is an overcompensation for lack of moisture! After using this product just once, I noticed a substantially different feel in my skin. It was glowing and had a beautiful sheen to it, that meant only one thing -- it had finally been penetrated with hydration! The cleanser itself, is very lightweight and glides on/off the skin with ease. It also takes off any makeup or SPF residue that may be left from the day, which most cleansers only touch on. Overall, I am very impressed with Skinfix and their products, and will be adding these into my daily routine."

One of the standouts there is ectoin, an amino acid derivative that helps protect skin from environmental stressors, improve texture, and soothe dehydrated skin.  The cleanser is effective at removing dirt and makeup, so much so that it works as a single step, but it would also make a good second step in a double cleanse. The only drawback for me is that it leaves a bit of a slick feeling on my skin at first, so it requires a little extra rinsing. I know that the feeling is actually good, because it means the product is hydrating; I have just never been able to get used to that sensation."

My mom sold cosmetics from the time I was a little girl and Iu2019ve always loved beauty from makeup to skincare and everything in between.

As such, Iu2019m always looking for new products that are effective for taking care of my skin that work well with my skin type.  Over the years, my skin has moved from oily in my teen years to more normal/leaning oily now that Iu2019m in my early 50u2019s so Iu2019m looking for products that are moisturizing/repairing that donu2019t leave me overly greasy and that will help me preserve the health of my skin for many years to come.  I have absolutely loved the skinfix barrier+ Ceramide + Ectoin Gentle Gel Cleanser.  The cleanser contains ectoin which is a natural moisturizer that helps to hydrate the skin by binding to water and reducing transepidermal water loss.  The cleanser was very gentle and once I rinsed it from my skin, my skin felt so moisturized rather than dry and tight like some cleansers for oily skin make your skin feel after using them.  As a bonus, the cleanser is also vegan.  The cleanser comes in a pretty light blue squeeze bottle similar to other products in the skinfix barrier + line.  I highly recommend this cleanser for anyone with oily skin who is looking for a cleanser that doesnu2019t strip the skin of all of its moisture and that leaves your skin feeling silky smooth after use."

I donu2019t like that if I accidentally donu2019t close it correctly it will spill everywhere. I at first thought it was a twist cap and then realized it was coming out."

I use tretinoin or retinol most nights and can sometimes feel my skin getting dehydrated. I started using this gel cleanser a few days ago and it has been a great addition to my routine. It comes in a tube so is easy to dispense in a controlled amount. It is a gel cleanser that foams and lathers up on damp skin. I have been using it at night time mostly as my second cleanser and i am happy to say it does not dry my skin out. It is actually quite hydrating and seems to have been helping with my skin barrier. It is also fragrance free and has no essential oils which I love for my sensitive skin. The ingredient that I found most exciting in this cleanser is Ectoin. It is a new ingredient for me and seems like one you would want in your routine especially if you have sensitive, dry and/or mature skin. I am super excited to continue to use this and grateful that i got to try it out."

It's a sleek design, simply by twisting the cap you're able to use it without removing it. A bit hard to explain but after using it just go ahead and lock it by twisting it back. I like the lather this one has. Be careful when dispensing since alot can come out but you don't need a whole lot. It makes my skin feel very clean and also helps with redness. I've been using this at the end of the day to also take off my makeup. I like that this one doesn't burn my eyes as I have that issue with other face cleansers. Overall it's a great face cleanser and if you have any breakouts it helps clear out your skin. This is definitely a new staple for me."

It is not for anybody that is too sensitive because it is very very intense, however if you are willing to give it a patch test, I highly recommend it because it is really great getting at the deep gunk that can be stuck in your pores. I noticed a difference after about a week of consistent use and that has allowed stop using other types of cleansers.

This makes it more difficult in my opinion to get the right amount of product dispensed since the product just comes out full force since it is a liquid cleanser. I would be careful when opening this product because it can get messy fast. Now to talk about the actual product itself. I like that there isn't a strong scent but in terms of efficacy as a cleanser I do not think it did an adequate job of leaving my face feeling clean and fresh which is what I look for in a cleanser. I do think the gel to foam formula is quite innovative but ultimately, it left my skin wanting more of a deep clean. I believe if you have extremely dry skin this would be a very effective cleanser for you because it does not strip the face of any moisture. Personally, the cumbersome packaging as well as the product itself not giving my skin what it needs makes me reluctant to continue using this product in the future."

The smell is almost non existent and the the formula is very straight forward and this is perfect for sensitive skin. I use this daily since itu2019s very gently and I have not experienced any dryness it leaves my skin feeling clean but not tight and ready prepped for applying my serums on top. It didnu2019t cause any breakouts or clogging and it doesnu2019t strip moisture from the skin which is great but I also didnu2019t notice my skin changing drastically after using this cleanser for a week but hopefully over time the ceramides in it will make an improvement"

I find that the gel to foam aspect of the cleanser really allows me to get a through cleanse. I thought the bottle design was also interesting, you just twist the bottom and squeeze, no need to open or close a cap. Itu2019s truly an innovated cleanser that works great for all skin types. I love that it still has the Skinfix barrier repair properties that are found in all their products. Overall, I throughly enjoyed this cleanser and always reach for it as the first step in my skincare routine."

The packaging is also very cool and cute since it fits with their other products. However if you turn too much it can break off pretty easily, it still works after words buts itu2019s still definitely something that they can try to work on. Furthermore, when it opens it doesnu2019t leak out, which is good, but when trying to get the product I feel like personally too much product comes out but itu2019s nothing thatu2019s TOO hard to control.

Iu2019m surprised at how well it cleans my skin, it removes oil from my skin, as well as makeup and sunscreen. I like how lightweight and gentle the formula is, a little goes a long way. The product is a gel type but once you mix it with water and start lathering the product it becomes foamy.  The first time I used it, I twisted and tried to pull the lid off. When you remove the product from the box, I recommend being careful and slowly twist the cap to open and then gently squeeze out some of the product.

I've been in the beauty industry for the past 8 years and Skinfix is one of the best out there. This specific product could be great for some.  It's a gentle gel to foam Cleanser that most definitely works to remove makeup, SPF, excess sebum and daily debris without stripping or damaging the skin barrier, and it also has B-13 complex, ceramides, and ectoin which is to intensely hydrate and leave your skin softer and smoother. But unfortunately, for me personally  it does seem to make me break out with acne, other then that, my skin was looking smoother and feeling softer just after a few days of using it.   I did try it for a total of about a week, if not a little longer and my acne just stayed or kept getting a little worse so I havent used it again but other then that it did do the job as what it is entitled for. If you don't have acne prone skin I would most definitely recommend this product because again it does do its job and it has a lot of great, useful, and important ingredients you want to find in a skin care product.

In my experience, itu2019s a great 2nd cleanse and I love to use it in the shower. The steam helps open up my pores and I am able to really wash my face. I added the triple barrier cream on afterwards (at night).  If you want something gentle and effective, Iu2019d give this a shot, even if you have oily skin.

I have dry skin and a lot of cleansers make my skin even more dry by removing all of my skins natural oils. this skinfix cleanser didn't do that. It also is very very lightly scented. so I think this is great for any skin type , but especially sensitive or dry skin types can extra appreciate the gentleness of this gel cleanser . the packaging is a lovely blue. the lid is actually on the bottom and it twists to open which is great because all the product is right there and you never have to shake it to get product out it's just already right there at the opening because of gravity.

But I'm happy to report that this gel cleanser is great & doesn't break me out or irritates my skin. It's a clear gel that foams up nicely, half a pea size is enough, I use a silicon face scrub to wash my face. I love that it doesn't have dyes, fragrance or those silica beads. At first, I use a cleansing oil then Skinfix next. Then after a few days, I wondered if this gel cleanser can do what it claims, to remove makeup & SPF, so I tried it without using oil cleanser first. Gotta say that it does a good job cleansing my face to remove makeup & sunscreen , doesn't leave my skin dry or tight after. My face actually feels hydrated & soft. I did tried not putting on moisturizer afterwards to see if my skin would be dry but it feels pretty hydrated after a few hours. I recommend this product for teens & adults with acne prone & combination skin since it's powerful enough to get rid of products on your face yet gently & overdry your skin. I also like the twist top on the bottle, make it very convenient to use. But you will tend to squeeze out more & there is no way to put it back in, there is that flaw, so squeeze gently."

I was super geeked/excited to get another opportunity to try yet another skincare product from Skinfix - Ceramide + Ectoin Gentle Gel Cleanser . I've honestly been using this gel cleanser since I received it, I actually tried it on different occasions, once with it by itself then the other with my other Skinfix Barrier +  products . OMG !! I must admit/say, using it with or without any other skincare products, you'll still get incredible results . I love how it has a very lightweight, smooth, non-sticky, non greasy texture that removes all the excess oils without stripping, damaging or irritating my skin barrier since I struggle with dry/dehydrated skin, it's a lot worse during the winter/cold temps &' with the help of Patented B-L3 complex &' Ceramides, it'll continue to help replenish natural lipids &' also help continue enhancing moisturization &' improve my skin barrier to prevent anymore dryness/dehydrated skin &' that's where Ectoin comes in at . I definitely definitely recommend this Skinfix Barrier+ Ceramide + Ectoin Gel Cleanser, it's been nothing but amazing to my skin, considering my skin is very picky when it comes to skincare products, I was actually surprised my skin tolerated this cleanser . Skinfix has some amazing products &' such an amazing brand too"

This cleanser has a lot going for it, especially for those with sensitive or dry skin.  **Texture and Application:** The gel texture is very smooth and easy to apply. It lathers lightly, which makes it feel gentle on the skin. I appreciate that it doesn't leave my face feeling stripped or tight after use, which is a common issue with many cleansers.  **Ingredients:** The inclusion of ceramides and ectoin is a significant plus. Ceramides are known for their ability to restore and maintain the skin's natural barrier, and ectoin helps to soothe and protect the skin from environmental stressors. This combination works well to keep my skin hydrated and calm.  **Performance:** In terms of cleansing power, it effectively removes daily impurities and light makeup without any harsh scrubbing. However, for heavy or waterproof makeup, you might need a separate makeup remover. After washing, my skin feels clean, soft, and refreshed.  **Scent:** The scent is very mild and pleasant, which is great for those who are sensitive to strong fragrances. It has a light, almost unnoticeable scent that doesn't linger, adding to its appeal as a gentle cleanser.  **Packaging:** The packaging is straightforward and functional. The pump dispenser is convenient and hygienic, dispensing just the right amount of product each time.  **Overall Experience:** Overall, the Enthusiast Ceramide + Ectoin Gentle Gel Cleanser is a solid choice for anyone looking for a gentle yet effective cleanser. It excels in maintaining skin hydration and comfort, making it especially suitable for sensitive skin types. It's a reliable daily cleanser that supports skin health without causing irritation or dryness.

I usually double cleanse with oil based cleansers or a balm because previous cleansers Iu2019ve tried didnu2019t remove much properly but that was not the case here. I did the first cleanse and pat my skin dry to see if there was any leftover make up or oils and it was gone. The only thing that took a second cleanse to fully be removed was mascara but it was mostly out the first cleanse. Very shocking to me and it really got me excited. My skin was very smooth and definitely did not feel stripped."

I suffer from hormonal acne and have to be careful with what skincare products I use so as not to irritate my skin more. I have been looking for a cleanser to not only help with my acne but also help with redness, irritation, and dryness. This Ecotin and Ceramide gentle gel cleanser from Skinfix has helped me with all of the above. I have received so many more benefits than just my problem areas being helped. My skin feels soft and nourished, and the cleanser helps to calm my skin. I have never experienced so much hydration, instantly, from any cleanser that I've used before. The gel turns into a slight foam consistency when rubbed between the Palms. When I washed my face, it felt so luxurious and almost had a silky like texture.  This product is definitely my holy grail, and I will be using it for the rest of time! I will be purchasing more of this cleanser. It's such a wonderful product, and it would be perfect for any skin type. I feel like it could be a help for any skin issues that people may suffer from. Once again, such a great product!"

But once we got past that part, I must say the formula for this product was well thought-out. The consistency is runny but not thin, there's no fragrance, and it feels like washing my face with clouds once it lathered up. Immediately I felt the refreshing and moisturizing effects, and when I went to dry my face, I felt like there was that protective barrier that kept my skin hydrated.

I definitely feel that my face is clean after I wash with this cleanser. My main issue with it is that I still feel a tightness that usually comes with dried skin after cleansing. The strange thing about it is that even though I feel that tightness, my face does not feel or look dried out! Instead, it feels smooth to the touch. My skin doesn't look dried out, but it doesn't look hydrated either. It kind of leaves me hanging in a balance between dry and moisturized, which is odd.  I've been using it more often at night than in the morning, mainly because I feel that it's a bit stronger than my other cleansers, and I like to make sure my face is very clean in the evening so that I don't leave any dirt from the day sitting in my pores overnight. I follow up with my usual serums and a light moisturizer, which helps with the tightness.  I've never used a product with an aperature or opening like this before. I find it to be a bit messy, and I spilled some a few times because it just leaks out if the lid is faced downward while open. It felt very unique to me because I've never used a product with an opening like this, but it was just too inconvenient and sloppy.  I would still recommend it because I have also noticed that it helps to keep my skin more clear of blemishes than many other cleansing products I've used, which is a huge positive to me. I'm going with 3 stars on account of the almost-dry, tight feeling it causes even with the promised benefits of Ceramides, Ectoin, and SkinFix's patented B-L3 complex. I just had higher expectations for it. Although it doesn't seem to strip the skin barrier, I still feel a bit uncomfortable after usage and need to use other products to stabilize my skin afterwards."

During my first use, it took me by such surprise that I actually ended up wasting quite a bit of product. I went to unscrew the cap as I typically would with this type of packaging and was caught off guard by it coming out of the hole in the cap.

As a makeup enthusiast who wears full-face glam makeup every day, including waterproof products, finding a cleanser that thoroughly removes all traces of makeup is crucial.

However, I wouldn't recommend using this gel cleanser to remove eye makeup, especially for those with sensitive eyes or contact lens wearers like myself.

It easily melts into the skin and washes away all the gunk leaving your face smooth, dewy and moisturized! The only thing to note is the lid. I love how it just twists closed but beware if you donu2019t twist it super tight! Youu2019ll come home to a goopy face wash mess and 1/3 of your product wasted!"

This gel to foam formula contains ingredients such as their B-L3 complex and ceramides to improve skin barrier health as well as Ectoin for texture and to soothe dry skin. Itu2019s also vegan and cruelty free. Only a small amount is needed of this cleanser for me each time to get an amazing lather on my entire face and it does such a wonderful job cleansing even when removing my makeup where I have not felt the need for a double cleanse. Above all, I love that this does not leave my skin dry or tight but that it leaves my skin clean, soft, and hydrated without irritating my sensitive skin. I just love the overall fresh clean feeling that it provides and itu2019s benefits. It has become one of my go-to cleansers."

The texture of this product is one of the things I love most about it because it is a really refreshing gel texture that glides over my skin and does lather to a nice soapy consistency which I absolutely love. It also has a clean refreshing smell which makes washing my face even more enjoyable. After using this cleanser I also feel like my other products absorb even better into my skin.

It leaves my skin highly cleansed, washes away debris, makeup and oils(when I'm having a rare oily day)  I like to start with a dime sized amount, while my hands are damp I'll gently rub my hands together to create some lather in small circles or I'll use my silicone facial tool for when I want a more intense cleanse. The gel has a nice pudding like texture and creates an incredible soft foam. I like to rinse with cold water and pat my face dry. I will then use my other SkinFix products in my routine.  I'm really impressed by this brand! So far I haven't experienced any sensitivity issues, which is such a bonus because my face breaks out pretty easily as I'm aging. I adore that this brand is fragrance free, doesn't clog my pores and fully recommended by Dermatologists. Another great shout-out is that this product is made in the USA with globally sources ingredients like Ectoin, which is basically natural stress-protecting molecules. Kinda cool that these are the same effects you'd expect from being in healing hot springs. Which is a fantastic way to hydrate!  I've noticed a reduction of redness and it hasn't been over drying like some cleansers.  Definitely recommend!!"

It is a simple, gel to foam formula that is incredibly gentle yet effective at cleansing the skin. I like using this particular cleanser in the shower and when I need a deep clean to remove makeup and SPF at the end of the day. I love the way that the product is dispensed from the packaging (it is similar to the Skinfix moisturizer dispensers). It feels super lightweight and thin, but then foams up to a nice lather. I do wish that the cleanser was a little more hydrating, with a thicker, creamier foam formula. Once I use it and dry off my face, it feels like I need to moisturize immediately. I have drier skin in general, so this may not be an issue for those with normal or oily skin."

The texture of the cleanser is just right, although it tends to be a bit runny. What I really appreciate is that it doesn't have any strong scent. It's specifically designed for sensitive skin, which is a huge plus. The packaging of this cleanser is in a squeeze bottle instead of a pump, which has its pros and cons. On one hand, it allows for easy dispensing, but on the other hand, if I squeeze too hard, I tend to use more product than necessary, which has happened a few times. After using this cleanser, I did notice that my skin felt a bit dry, especially when I over-cleansed. However, despite the dryness, my skin feels incredibly clean and refreshed. I don't have that lingering feeling of dirt or residue on my skin, which is a great outcome.   **This review was collected as part of a promotion."

To start, the packaging is nice and simple, but I donu2019t think I am a big fan of the screw on and off cap with the top able to have product squeezed out of it as leaves that area open at all times for bacteria to enter even when u seal it closed, But with proper storing that should not be a problem. The product itself has not irritated my skin at all and has really felt nice on my oily T-zone area however it has not left a very bouncy soft feeling on my cheeks that I was expecting. Itu2019s definitely gentle and it did remove my makeup but I would not recommend this if you are looking for a supple feel afterwards but more of a gentle cleanse!   **This review was collected as part of a promotion."

I know a lot of people like that when itu2019s more milky and not very sudsy but I actually prefer a good foam or lather when I wash .  It comes off nicely with no residue .

So Iu2019m unsure of my opinion really , Iu2019d say so so .   I think I prefer the oil to foam one they have .

The texture is light, and you don't need much to get a good foam going. The only downside I found was that it was less effective at controlling my acne than the benzoyl peroxide face wash that I typically use, but I don't think that this wash actually caused increased my acne."

I find the Cleanser to be effective at removing my makeup and cleaning my skin with out needing to us an additional makeup remover. The twist lid is so cool and makes it easier to use in the shower! No gunk build up like you can get sometimes with normal open and shut lids. I have combination skin that can lean senstive, I find that the Cleanser does not dry my skin out or cause any irritation. It's truly scent free also! I highly recommend this Cleanser if you have sensitive leaning skin, the packing is also decent sized and I think it will last quite awhile."

Using this cleanser as a last step helps to get off any additional residue that my makeup remover didn't catch. I also have oily acne-prone skin, and I tend to gravitate towards foaming cleansers in order to break down the oils and clean my skin. I love that this is a gel-to-foam formula, as it really gets my skin clean. Foaming cleansers tend to be really drying and leave your skin feeling tight, but I didn't have that problem using this cleanser at all! You don't have to use a huge amount of it either; I find that a dime-sized amount or less is enough to get my skin clean. Overall, I would recommend it!"

So to list all the good parts first- it makes your skin feel VERY clean, it takes off makeup without needing a double cleanse, it even removes mascara (I didn't try it with waterproof mascara. Only regular.) I feel like everything it cleans, it cleans well. I even tried it under my arms, just because of how clean it made my face feel. It's even incredible at cleaning that area, and after the fact there was no smell even without deodorant. I know that's weird. But it was actually super interesting.  The reason I docked a star, though, is how dry it makes my face. I'm combo/oily, and usually face washes don't make my skin feel dry. But this one actually enhanced dry patches on my face. Nothing a little exfoliation didn't help, but if you're dry as it is I'd be careful to moisturize extra with this cleanser. I would still highly recommend it though!

I think this is a pretty big problem for me and given that it is a relatively simple cleanser overall, I donu2019t see myself replacing my drug store cleanser with this after I finish using the bottle.

            "review_text": "Iu2019ve been using this cleanser for about a week. Itu2019s a gel texture cleanser that distributes nicely over my face, and I also use it over my eyes and lashes. It foams up very nicely, does not sting and washes off very easily with no residue or sticky feeling left behind. My skin feels nice and moisturized, it doesnu2019t feel dry or stripped. The tube has a twist lock cap which makes it very easy to use and prevent leaking. It doesnu2019t have a particular scent to me, it is non scented. You only have to use a small amount to get a good cleanse going so the product should last quite a while. The box itself looks nice and has all the information you need from the product and its ingredients. I really like the cleanser and will continue using it, especially since itu2019s gently enough to use over the eyes.   **This review was collected as part of a promotion."

            "review_text": "Skinfix Barrier+ Ceramide + Ectoin Gentle Gel Cleanser is a skincare product designed to cleanse the skin while maintaining its natural moisture barrier. Formulated with ceramides and ectoin, this gentle gel cleanser promises to leave the skin feeling clean, soft, and hydrated.  One of the standout features of this cleanser is its gentle formula, which is suitable for all skin types, including sensitive skin. The gel texture feels refreshing on the skin and lathers well, providing a thorough cleanse without stripping the skin of its natural oils.  I particularly appreciate the inclusion of ceramides in this cleanser, as they are known for their ability to strengthen the skin barrier. This is especially beneficial for those with dry or compromised skin, as it helps to lock in moisture and protect the skin from environmental aggressors. Another key ingredient in this cleanser is ectoin, a natural molecule that is said to have anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. This ingredient helps to soothe and calm the skin, making it ideal for those with sensitive or irritated skin.  In terms of performance, I found that the Skinfix Barrier+ Ceramide + Ectoin Gentle Gel Cleanser effectively removes dirt, oil, and makeup without leaving any residue behind. After using this cleanser, my skin feels clean, refreshed, and soft to the touch.  I also appreciate the packaging of this product, which comes in a convenient pump bottle that dispenses just the right amount of product. The bottle is also sturdy and easy to use, making it ideal for both home and travel use.  Overall, I highly recommend the Skinfix Barrier+ Ceramide + Ectoin Gentle Gel Cleanser to anyone looking for a gentle yet effective cleanser that helps to maintain the skinu2019s natural moisture barrier. Whether you have dry, sensitive, or normal skin, this cleanser is sure to leave your skin feeling clean, hydrated, and refreshed"

I had a nice experience using the Skin Fix Ceramide and Ectoin Gentle Gel Cleanser.   I apply the cleanser to wash my face in the mornings and night. After rinsing the cleanser, it helps to pat your skin dry with a washcloth or hand towel. The cleaner does not irritate my skin, cause acne breakouts, or leave it red. It has a smooth texture. It does not have a smell and pleasantly lathers on my skin well.  The cleanser has helped my skin from being dry and looking dull. The product helps to keep my skin feeling healthy and looking nice. I am pleased with SkinFix products and enjoy using them regularly. The brand does not add unnecessary chemicals and fragrances to their product. This review was collected as part of a promotion."

            "review_text": "Skinfix was a new brand to me a couple months ago. However, I got to try out a couple of their moisturizers & realized what I was missing.   When I saw their new Ceramide + Ectoin Gentle Gel Cleanser, I knew I needed to try it out. I was super pleased with how well it worked, the texture, the packaging & how my skin looked & felt.   The packaging is recognizable. The Cleanser comes in a fairly large tube type container. To open it, you have to twist the cap. It clicks when you twist it open. I love this feature. It means nothing is going to waste in a cap.   The only downside I saw was that the gel did dispense quickly even without squeezing the tube. I thought the speed was fine. I was more worried that some would be wasted because I wasn't ready for it to exit the tube yet.   The texture was fantastic. It is a clear gel. It wasn't overly thick or super thin. I thought it was a pretty even consistency. It was smooth & felt almost creamy right before it foams. It has a good amount of foam. It wasn't thick like a lather & it didn't disappear super fast either. A testament to how well it's formulated.   I used it both in the morning & at night. I felt it worked equally well at both intervals.   Skinfix tied in their patented B-L3 complex as part of the ingredients. The formula consists of ceramides, fatty acids, cholesterol, B9, vitamin E, folic acid & signal peptides. It's a powerhouse formula set to restore, repair & maintain a healthy skin barrier.   This cleanser gets the job done, too. It removed all my skincare products & makeup without having to double cleanse.   This review was collected as part of a promotion"

I put a light layer of warm water on my face and then us a pea sized amount of the product and rub it until it lathers on my face. I then rinse it off with some more warm water and tap it dry with a clean towel. It is a guarantee that my face feels so fresh. I highly recommend~"

            "review_text": "So, I decided to give the Ceramide + Ectoin Gentle Gel Cleanser by Skinfix a try. Iu2019m all about gentle cleansers that donu2019t mess with my skinu2019s natural oils. After dealing with cystic acne (thank you, Accutane and stress management!), now Iu2019m just trying to keep my skin happy, hydrated, and balanced. That's why I was so excited to try this face wash because of skin barrier healing benefits!  When I first unscrewed the cap all the product squirts out into my hand. And then... I realized how the actual cap works. You only have to turn the cap a smidge for the product to come out of the tint hole in the center that disperses the product.) It's still not necessarily my favorite way of dispensing face wash.  The cleanser itself doesnu2019t have any scent, which I appreciate, and it also doesn't leave my skin feeling dry. After using it for about a week, morning and night, my skin definitely feels softer.  So, if youu2019re thinking about trying it out, just be careful when youu2019re dispensing the product. Apart from that hiccup, the Ceramide + Ectoin Gentle Gel Cleanser is pretty solid."

As a personal preference I prefer gel cleanser that turns into foam with water and that was the case with Skinfix cleanser, its texture aligns with my preference. Itu2019s so gentle on the skin yet cleans the skin. However with makeup it did not remove thick textures like mascara so personally I would clean my skin from makeup first with makeup remover then use the cleanser. The presence of ceramide leaves the skin not so dry after cleaning my face. Itu2019s also important for anti aging factors which makes it really appealing. Also it helps protect and renew skin barrier. The packaging was not the best in my opinion, although it is new however I find it unhygienic since i cannot place it on any counter as it will contaminate the area in which the product come out in."

The twist cap I actually came to like because it's easier to use while in the shower, no need to unscrew a cap that I'd most likely drop and it's quicker than using a flip back style cap. As far as scent goes this is truly unscented and any smell from ingredients is pretty neutral. It lathers up nicely! It feels really soft and luxurious while scrubbing on skin. It leaves skin feeling clean without feeling stripped and at the same time my skin felt quite hydrated. I would go as far as to say you could even go without moisturizer after using if your skin isn't terribly dry. I would recommend for all skin types as this worked on all areas of my combo skin. Definitely a cleanser I will keep coming back for! This review was collected as part of a promotion."

To me this is super helpful and prevents me from having to worrying about dropping the cap and searching for it all the time. This gel suds up very nicely and does a great job of removing all make up and other skin products. This cleanser has no fragrance or other harmful ingredients that I do not like.

It is similar to the glossier and drunk elephant jelly cleansers - glossier milky jelly cleanser and drunk elephant beste no 9 jelly cleanser.  This product claims to remove makeup and I can attest to that. It removed the ere perez avocado waterproof mascara easily. However I personally still prefer double cleansing and would use this product as a second cleanser.  The cleanser works effectively while being gentle on the skin. It is pretty liquidy and foams up a lot. It doesn't sting the eyes, except when I cleansed a sunscreen with avobenzone. Not the cleansers fault though.  My biggest gripe is the packaging design is flawed. It has a twist mechanism which unlocks the product, also very similar to drunk elephant protini moisturizer. However with those products the hole is on the top of the moisturizer. For this product it is at the bottom, which means if there is any residue (there always is), it will get on the counter. I have been resting it on the side. Personally I would have preferred just a regular flip top cap.   **This review was collected as part of a promotion."

This new Ceramide + Ecotoin Gel Cleanser from Skinfix works beautifully as a stand alone cleanser removing all makeup thoroughly or as a second step in a double-cleanse. As someone with combination skin, I typically prefer foaming cleansers and this one has a lovely gel to foaming formula that lathers beautifully once you add water and massage onto the skin. It contains a subtle scent that dissipates quickly. I love that it is formulated with their patented B-L3 Complex along with ceramides and ectoin which aid in hydrating the skin and supporting the skin barrier while cleansing and leaving the skin super soft and supple. I have quickly become a huge fan of this cleanser and how it makes my skin look super clean and refreshed after washing. I also truly appreciate that it seems a bit concentrated, so a little goes a long way, however with the current packaging, it is easy to spill or overuse, so I would definitely keep that in mind as you need to be conscious of it so you don't unintentionally waste precious product. Other than the packaging, I really do like how well this cleanser works and that it does not strip the skin of its natural oils. Definitely would recommend for anyone looking for a fabulous gel cleanser."

I am however, very acne prone and tend to break out occasionally.   In reviewing the ingredients, I love that it has multiple ingredients which aids skin barrier, provides hydration, and evens skin tone.  Some of those ingredients are jojoba oil, ectoin, squalene, polyglutamic acid, multiple peptides, ceramides, and niacinamide. Something I was surprised to see, was that it had lactic acid which is an active exfoliant, given that the cleanser is advertised as gentle. If you have sensitive skin or you are not able to tolerate actives, just be careful about reaching for it.  The cleanser comes in a sizeable container. I used this cleanser after first cleansing my face with Micellar water using a cotton pad. To dispense it, I had to twist the cap and squeeze the tube. I liked this method of dispensing the product. The cleanser is of a gel consistency. It was fragrance free and smelled very gentle. I applied it to my face using my fingers and used circular motions to get dirt off my face. The gel lathered up with water. The first thing I noticed was how hydrating and nourishing it felt. I did not feel like my skin was being stripped dry. The cleanser left my skin feeling soft. Despite it having lactic acid, I was able to use it morning and night with no issues or sensitivity. I really like this cleanser because it gave me everything I needed: hydration and exfoliation, while evening skin tone and improving skin barrier. I will get this again."

It has a delicate, barely-there scent that is pleasant and not overwhelming, a plus for those with sensitivities to fragrance especiallyin skincare! It also provides deep moisture, leaving the skin feeling soft, and replenished after each use. Unlike traditional foaming cleansers that can leave the skin feeling tight this gel ensures that drier skin types are left feeling deeply hydrated and nourished. I was also pretty impressed by the cleansers efficacy in removing excess makeup like mascara that was left behind.

I tend to be especially weary of cleansing products because of their potential to strip my skin barrier of moisture and possibly dry out my already eczema-prone face. I always have to ensure the products I use are gentle and mild without containing any irritants that could cause a flare-up. So when I saw this Skinfix Cleansing product I was more than elated to test it out and see for myself just how gentle it is. This was a delight across the board! Using this to clean off a dayu2019s worth of layered SPF-based face products and oil-based moisturizer I noticed that my skin felt clean and fresh. I didnu2019t experience any issues with dryness or post-face washing redness or irritation. The fact that this also contains ceramide as an active is even more enticing for those who have sensitive skin concerns."

I knew immediately when I applied this gentle cleanser to my face that this was special just by how soothing it felt, this gel foams a little as you massage it into your face  and neck, it feels refreshing and you can feel it cleaning your skin but, not stripping. After rinsing and patting my face dry my skin felt hydrated with no redness or irritation, this gel actually calmed my skin. I then applied my normal skincare and I couldnu2019t believe how great my skin looked and felt. With continuous use of this soothing gel my skin looked and felt better!! I had never heard of one of the ingredients which is, Ectoin and looked it up and this is what I discovered; Ectoin is an anti-inflammatory that actually heals and protects your skin from antioxidants. Ectoin helps your skin barrier to retain moisture kind of like a hyaluronic acid does. I found itu2019s also compared to Niacinamide. Ectoin has a long list of amazing attributes like plumping fine lines & wrinkles, as well as smoothing rough and bumpy skin.

Not only is it gentle, but the thoughtful ingredients actually help to repair my skin barrier, soften my skin and even remove my makeup thoroughly. I am really enjoying the unique packaging as well. The bottle twists open at the bottom, making it such a convenient cleanser to keep anywhere you prefer whether it be the shower, by the sink or in a compartment.

This is not thick or runny and it makes me feel like my skin is getting really clean and also I have noticed a lot less shine which is something that I like . At times my skin has a sheen like oily look that I dislike. This Gel cleanser has been such a great benefit and a pleasure to use and I can see myself adding this to my daily skincare regimen.

For reference, I have combination skin that leans dry, and some of my main skincare concerns are acne, post-acne marks, and hydration. Overall, I really liked this cleanser! I've been using it once a day, primarily during my nighttime skincare routine. It's unscented and has the consistency of a typical gel cleanser. It does turn to foam a bit when I lather it into my skin, but not as much as I anticipated based on the description. That said,  I feel like it's very effective! I typically double cleanse, first with a micellar water and then with this cleanser. It picks up everything left behind from my first rinse and leaves my skin feeling clean and refreshed! I love that this cleanser is focused on skin barrier health and that it includes effective ingredients like ceramides and ecotin. The only thing I don't love about this product is the packaging- the lockable cap is fun and innovative, but I've had trouble not smearing face wash all over the cap while using it, and thus transferring some face wash to my counter when I put it back down. Still, the product itself is great, and it's been a wonderful addition to my skincare routine! I would recommend it to anyone looking for a reliable and high-quality face cleanser!"

The best part though is how gentle this cleanser is. I have dry skin and I found that this cleanser doesn't dry me out, my skin doesn't feel tight when I use it. In fact, this cleanser is so hydrating! It indeed helps to protect the skin barrier and overall leaves my skin feeling smooth and refreshed. Who doesn't love a cleanser that not only does its job but contributes to the health of skin? In addition, I'd like to mention that I'm impressed that this product is both vegan and cruelty free along with being made in the USA.

First and foremost, the formula is exceptional. Ectoin, the star ingredient, is renowned for its ability to improve skin texture and soothe dry, dehydrated skin. Since incorporating this cleanser into my regimen, I've noticed a remarkable difference in the overall health and appearance of my skin. It feels more nourished, hydrated, and resilient, with a noticeable improvement in texture.  What truly sets this cleanser apart is its gentle yet effective cleansing action. As a 47-year-old female, I prioritize products that cleanse without stripping away essential moisture. The Skinfix Barrier+ Gentle Gel Cleanser strikes the perfect balance. It thoroughly removes impurities, makeup, and excess oil, leaving my skin feeling clean, refreshed, and supple, without any tightness or dryness.  Additionally, the inclusion of skin-identical lipids further enhances the moisturizing properties of this cleanser. Not only does it cleanse my skin, but it also helps to reinforce the skin's natural barrier, promoting long-term hydration and resilience.  Versatility is another key aspect of this product that I truly appreciate. Whether it's part of my pre-workout routine at 4 AM, my morning skincare regimen, or my evening makeup removal routine, this cleanser delivers consistent results without causing any irritation or discomfort.  I must also mention the packaging, which features an easy twist-open lid for convenient use. However, it's important to ensure that the lid is securely closed to prevent any leaks.  In terms of results, I couldn't be more pleased. My skin looks and feels healthier, with a noticeable improvement in hydration, radiance, and overal texture. Fine lines and wrinkles appear softened. *This review was created through an educational promotional event hosted between the brand and beauty experts."

It even took reduce the look of my pores on my nose. In the photo, you can see that the product turns to foam. For my experience, it was better to use the product after the show to make sure I activated the product.

I absolutely love that all Skinfix products are vegan, cruelty-free, and plastic-neutral! I was also really impressed with the ingredients in this product like the B-L3 complex, ectoin, and ceramides, which all help to improve the health of the skin barrier. I feel like so many products on the market focus on the effectiveness of the products without focusing on the health of the skin itself, and I love that Skinfix does both effectively. First off, I love that like the other Skinfix products that I have tried, this cleanser is unscented so anyone can use it without needing to worry about sensitivities caused by added scents. I also really liked the consistency of this product. I thought that the gel lathered really nicely and that a little bit of product went a long way. I also found that this cleanser did a great job at removing any SPF or makeup, leaving my skin feeling very clean. After using the cleanser, I thought that my skin felt very hydrated, smooth, and soft, which I loved! I struggle with dry skin on a few areas on my face and I found that even without moisturizer my skin didnu2019t seem as dry as it usually is. The only thing that isnu2019t my favorite about this product is the design of the lid. While it does make dispensing the product easy, it can be a little tricky to close with one hand and once it is twisted closed a little extra product comes out, so you need to wipe it up. This is a really minor issue though and I absolutely plan on repurchasing this product in the future, as well as other Skinfix products! I definitely recommend this cleanser to anyone, but if you have sensitive or dry skin, this is a great product to try!"

It made my skin smooth and it got rid of the dirt from my pores which is nice. I would say that it would be best to take a little cleanser in hand and a little water to lather the hands to make a foam to wash. The con that I have with it is the bottle pertaining to the cap. It was a little bit confusing opening it and getting the product out, wish it was just a cap to open it and squeeze out the product. But nonetheless I love the gel cleanser."

I gently massage this cleanser on my face for about a minute and then rinse my face with warm water.   My skin feels extremely fresh and clean after using this cleanser.

Post-wash, my skin remains hydrated without any sense of dryness or tightness. However, the packaging is where I encounter a slight hiccup.

I have been using this cleansing gel in my skincare routine, and I must say that I really like it. I have also been combining it with the cream from the same Barrier line. I could notice that it is a cleanser that is very gentle on the skin, it is light and glides very smoothly, creating foam immediately. You can feel how it deeply cleanses the skin, removing any trace of dirt, makeup or sunscreen, but without leaving it dry or tight. You don't need a lot of product to achieve a good result. Another important fact is that it is fragrance-free, which is good if you are a person with sensitive skin. I highly recommend it.  *This review was collected as part of a promotion."

            "review_text": "Skinfix has been killing it with their barrier+ line, and I'm impressed by every product I've come across. As someone who values skincare routines that prioritize skin health, I was intrigued by the promise of a cleanser that not only cleansed but also nurtured the skin. This particular gel-to-foam cleanser targets the removal of all debris, makeup, and sunscreen while maintaining and protecting the skin barrier.  One of the standout features of this cleanser is its gentle formulation. With no harsh ingredients or fragrance that strip the skin of its natural oils, it instead leaves my skin feeling clean, refreshed, and comfortably hydrated. This gentle approach is especially beneficial for those with sensitive or easily irritated skin, as it helps minimize the risk of inflammation or redness.  I like the innovative design of the cap; however, there's always some product left over every time I use it, which could dry out and clog the opening. The texture of the cleanser is a clear liquid gel, which lathers up beautifully and glides smoothly across the skin, making cleansing feel like a luxurious experience. Overall, I enjoy using this cleanser in combination with their barrier+ line products. It's an awesome routine for anyone looking to get back to basics and restore the skin barrier.   ** This review was collected as part of a promotion"

The last few years I have made a point to focus on my skincare routines, but the most important step, face washing has always taken a back seat. This is primarily due to my dry skin. When I wash my face 1-2 times per day, I always end up with my skin even more dry by the 4th day. That was until I found this Skinfix cleanser! I have been using this daily for over a week and my skin is thriving. I havenu2019t noticed any issues with increased dryness, if anything it is helping my skin retain more moisture. Skinfix knocks it out of the park with literally every single product I have tried. This cleanser is lightweight and makes my skin feel and look clean after using. I highly recommend trying this is you suffer from dry skin and struggle with increased dryness from daily washing."

I generally consider my skin combination, but with the change of season, my skin tends to be oily. So as you read my review, please keep in mind that I tested this Skinfix Ceramide + Ectoin Gentle Gel Cleanser, 150 ml, when my skin was in an oily state. This Skinfix cleanser comes in a tube with a twist-off cap. It stands on the cap. The tube is easy to squeeze the product out and retains its shape very well. I have used some cleansers where the tubes do not bounce back, so I have to do a lot of hand-strengthening exercises when I use them, but not this one. This one is easy to dispense. However, I would definitely prefer a flip-off cap. With wet hands, it is not easy to open a twist-off cap, especially when I need to rush through my morning routine with young kids in the house. It contains ceramide and ectoin, so cleansing my face does not have to mean stripping my face. In fact, I have read about ectoin and its lasting moisturizing benefits and it was clear what I read is true. Even though I did not have personal experience using this on dry spots because my skin tends to be oily during spring, I would recommend this to all skin types that want a non-drying daily face cleanser; however, the delivery of the product could be improved.

I used the Skinfix gentle gel cleansing after a long day to remove all of the makeup and sunscreen that were on my face the whole day. Smooth in texture, the gel is simple to froth by hand or with a foaming maker tool. Without feeling tight, my skin felt cleansed, revitalized, and moisturized. The cleanser complements my current skincare regimen so effectively even on the first day makes me very happy. With a new cleanser, my skin usually appears dull for a few days, but not with this Skinfix cleanser. Unquestionably skin-sensitive and friendly! How great is the packaging! Getting the right amount of product without spilling or leaving it open to the air is simple and highly hygienic. I pair it with matching Skinfix gel moisturizer. There has been a slight but perceptible improvement in the texture of my skin, making it less rough and bumpy. Highly recommend it for sure!"

I suffer dry skin especially on my face and a lot of cleansers irritate that. Skinfix didn't.  This cleanser did an amazing job at removing traces of makeup and spf. It left me feeling clean without being dry or leaving my skin itchy or tight. No scent to speak of. It foams really well.  Now, the bad. It leaks. You have to store it upside down or it will leak everywhere. Not a huge fan of that because if you aren't aware of that fact you can potentially lose a lot of product.

Finding a cleanser that effectively removes makeup, SPF, and excess oils without leaving my skin feeling stripped or irritated has always been a struggle. But this cleanser? It's like a breath of fresh air for my skin.  First off, I love how gentle it is. The gel formula feels incredibly soothing as I massage it into my skin, and it effortlessly lifts away all traces of makeup and sunscreen without any harsh scrubbing required. Plus, it rinses off cleanly without leaving behind any residue, which is a huge bonus for someone like me who hates that tight, dry feeling some cleansers can leave behind.  But what really sets this cleanser apart is its great ingredients including ceramides and ectoin. These two work together to not only cleanse my skin but also to strengthen and protect its natural barrier. It's like giving my skin a little boost of resilience with every wash! And let me tell you, since I started using this cleanser, my skin has never looked better. It's clearer, smoother, and more balanced than I have noticed recently.  I also appreciate the thoughtfulness that went into formulating this product. It's free of harsh chemicals and potential irritants, so I can trust that I'm not doing any harm to my skin.  Overall, I can't recommend the Ceramide + Ectoin Gentle Gel Cleanser enough. Whether you have sensitive skin or you're just looking for a gentle yet effective cleanser that won't compromise your skin barrier, this is the one for you!"

SkinFix is a clean beauty brand, and this makes me feel at ease that what I put on my face are nonabrasive ingredients.

So, it may be best to open the cleanser while the lip is held up, not facing downwards because some of the cleanser can leak out.  The is a wonderful clean beauty cleanser you can feel good about using that is made without harsh toxic ingredients such as parabens, fragrance, propylene glycol, and phthalates!

This gel cleanser was no exception. Exceeding my expectations.  Firstly the packaging is so clever and innovative. You just twist and squeeze oppose to opening up the cap and possible getting water in your product if left in the shower. Itu2019s vegan which is always a plus in my book and tested and RECOMMENDED by dermatologist. In fact I found out about this brand several years ago via my own dermatologist. I have very dry and eczema probed skin, I have NEVER broken out in rash or any other way from anything skin fix.  Now letu2019s really get into this cleanser! I have been sick with a cold for about a week and my skin was suffering! Blowing my nose constantly left my skin raw. While using this ceramide+ectoin gentle gel cleanser not only did it not burn when I washed my face but it in fact moisturized my skin! My skin was feeling so fresh but not stripped at all. A little goes a very long way. Great for all my people with sensitive skin. The lather is amazing! I canu2019t get enough! Run out and get this asap!"

            "review_text": "As a selfcare-obsessed digital creator who has been in the beauty sphere for over 20 years I'm always on the hunt for the next best skincare product that works for my ageing, dry, sensitive and eczema-prone skin.  I've never met a Skinfix product my skin didn't love.  Skinfix Barrier Ceramides + Ectoin gel cleanser targets dry, dehydrated, dull-looking skin without added Parfum, silicones, PEGs and essentials oils to make caring for my skin as gentle as possible without triggering an allergic reaction.  This cleanser is incredible gentle, lathers up well, removes stubborn makeup thanks to all the beautiful oil ingredients and tackles remnants of sunscreen in one effortless go. Absolutely no need to double cleanse - my evening routine is simplified without cutting corners.   Skinfix's newest gentle cleanser leaves my skin feeling soft, nourished and clean without being squeaky, stripped or tight.   My only slight issue is regarding the design of this container. The tube is sitting on the dispenser and it leaks. Every time I twist the cap on, more product oozes out of the head. To not waste cleanser, I keep the tube standing upside down.  If your skin is hyper reactive or have added-scent sensitivities, have a compromised skin barrier or just dry and looking dull, consider trying Skinfix Barrier+ Ceramides cleanser."

Looking for products that really work and are good for my skin is important. From good skin care to good cosmetics and taking care of your skin means the better your face will look with and without makeup! Iu2019ve recently started using Skinfix Ceraminde + Ectoin Gentle Gel cleanser. This cleanser is so good for your skin with its special ingredients like its patented BL3 complex, ceramides and Ectoin. This gentle cleanser is great to use every day. It works wonderfully at removing all of my makeup and dirt build up from the day. It even removes spf! I noticed my skin has been so much smoother, softer and more clean since I have started using this cleanser everyday. This lightweight gel to foam cleanser helps to maintain and improve the skin barrier. In turn, resulting in a more nourished, healthy and hydrated complexion. I really love this face wash and it has quickly become a new fav!!"

            "review_text": "This review was collected as part of a promotion.  I love this vegan cleanser. Iu2019m a beauty Skincare Advisor and Makeup artist and this is perfect and the best for getting off my makeup and general cleansing. I really liked it, excellent quality, it cleans the pores deeply. I specifically recommend this cleanser for excessively oily faces, eventhough I have combination skin it's still works.  It's an excellent gel to foam cleanser that removes whiteheads around the wings of my nose and other parts of my face. I use it exclusively for my face and neck area, and I find it very effective even with the help of the cream of the same brand. I love that this cleanser balances my skin beatuifully. It doesn't strip your skin, but gets it very clean, and bright. This gel cleanser has a light texture, very little is needed to cleanse and create a soft foam and with the ingredients of Ceramides and Ectione you can't go wrong."

            "review_text": "The skinfix ectoin and ceramide gentle gel cleanser is great for sensitive to all different skin types. Itu2019s a gel cleanser that transforms into foam when lathered up. Itu2019s non-fragranced and non-irritating, which I prefer in my skin care. After a couple of uses, my skin feels cleaner and softer without overly drying. Itu2019s effective at removing surface oils, sunscreen, and makeup, while helping to restore hydration back to the skin due to the ceramides and ectoin. A downside is the applicator, the cleanser comes out in a twist and squeeze fashion, but I prefer caps that you can open/close for protection. Even though it was twisted closed, I found that some of the cleanser leaked while sitting upright. Despite this defect, I recommend this cleanser for all universal skin types and if you enjoy using the skinfix barrier+ collection, you will enjoy this as well."

The only reason I canu2019t give this product a 5 is because it claims to breakdown sunscreen and makeup and it didnu2019t really do that for me. After reading those claims I was excited to have a product that would allow me to only use one cleanser instead of having to double cleanse. Usually, I remove my make up with micellar water on a cotton pad and then go in with my cleanser. I tried this on my face with my make up and sunscreen still intact and it removed most of it, but didnu2019t lather up the same way and didnu2019t leave my skin feeling completely clean. But it works just fine as a second cleanse or a morning cleanser, so I will definitely be adding it into my rotation."
