Very hard to comb/brush through and run my fingers through. I didnu2019t like the feeling of it. Almost similar to washing your hair with shampoo only. I noticed some shine though to my hair which is nice but I feel like a hair gloss would definitely be better."

First I tried the regular version and I was really disappointed, but the extra strength does the job. My hair still gets some frizz and reverting towards roots and ends by the time Im back at home after a night out, but really will only ever need a little touch up the next day when I use this. Without it in my routine, its a noticeable difference now. The bottle lasts me about 3-4 styles, but i have A LOT of hair. If you have curly hair don't expect it to be invincible to humidity, but it makes maintaining a heated look easier 100% and is worth the money if you do it often. A tip I have is make sure you really do apply generously before u blowout your hair or its not going to do anything for you. I cant wait for that EXTRA EXTRA strength to come out LOL."

Now that I no longer work at Sephora this is actually one of the very few products I will ALWAYS repurchase. My hair is wavy in some areas and some areas are curly, dry, frizzy, and damaged. I have thin strands but a lot of them. I do not like the packaging of the big bottle so I pour it into my mini to spray. It does take half the bottle for my hair. Would give 4.5 stars strictly for the sprayer on the bigger bottle but the product itself is 10 stars! I use this when I straighten and I use the curly version when I air dry to keep my curls from getting frizzy. In the photo it is straight and so shiny but it doesn't feel sticky, tacky, or heavy."

Iu2019m also not great at doing so. This product from Colorwow is pretty impressive to me in the sense that I only needed ONE product to achieve even better results than I can get with my usual 2-3. It is a bit time consuming to apply because of needing to fully saturate all strands. I will also likely only get a few uses out of this bottle due to that. I canu2019t give it a full 5 stars because of that, but Iu2019d be lying if I didnu2019t say that I do think Dreamcoat is worth the hype in terms of results. I donu2019t think it lasts through washing like it says, but thanks to not needing multiple styling products, I can go several days between washes without getting oily/hair feeling gross.

However, with Wow's Dream Coat applied my hair lasted for 5 days and that's only because I work out and I must wash my hair often. My strands were very smooth, soft, silky, and I had no frizz.

Itu2019s a sleek silver container with black lettering and has a nozzle thatu2019s easy to use. Lately, itu2019s been raining and Iu2019ve been having really bad hair days so this spray came just in time to rescue my hair. Itu2019s had so much frizz, and flyaways, and is just unmanageable. Following the directions I washed, conditioned, and towel-dried my hair until it felt damp as suggested in the instructions. Next, I separated my hair into sections working with one section at a time. I liberally sprayed with Dream Coat and blow-dried and was amazed at the immediate difference I saw after doing the first section. I continued to spray and blow dry the remaining sections and was wowed by the results. My dull, dehydrated-looking hair has been transformed and I love how beautiful and healthy it looks. Itu2019s smooth and hydrated and all the frizziness and flyaway are gone. Dream Coat really lives up to itu2019s claim and I plan on purchasing more once Iu2019ve finished this bottle. Highly recommend. This product was gifted by colorwow"

Extra Strength Dream Coat has changed that. I spray sections of my hair liberally while it's still damp. Blow dry/ straighten with a brush, using some tension, per the directions. AMAZING results!

But I was very shocked and surprised after trying this product that it actually does what it claims to do. I live in the south and my hair is always exposed to extreme humidity. Usually about 10-20 mins after blow drying my hair it starts to show signs of exposure to humidity. I used dream coat as directed on the bottle and I am happy to say that my hair has remained frizz and poof free. Even after going to the gym and sweating profusely, my hair has stayed exactly how it was when I first dried it. This stuff is seriously a magic potion!

Key points to get the sleek results are absolutely not included in directions on the bottle. I wish that the brand included them.  Dream Coat Extra Strength is water-based. Just towel-drying my low porosity hair didn't work. I deep conditioned my hair and then air-dried my hair until it was nearly dry, not damp. That's key step 1. Key step 2:Working in 3-finger width sized sections of hair throughout, I sprayed Dream coat four times per section. I did not apply any other products because that's another key tip to make it work.  I blow dried each section on medium heat with a rounded boar brush. Key step 3: After I completed all the sections, and my hair and roots were completely dry and cooled, I then applied non water-based products, which is key step 4. The only thing I used next was a light application of a lightweight oil (sweet almond oil). Key step 5:I set my Babyliss flat iron to 300 so not to steam my hair. I chased the flat iron with a flat iron straightening comb. My hair looked like a professional silk press! My hair didn't revert, looked glossy and had body and movement.  It was a time consuming process but the end result was gorgeous. I highly recommend this and this was my first time ever using a Color Wow product. I received the product complimentary from the Color Wow for my honest opinion."

I have very fine, thin, long hair. I find that if I take the time to apply and work this product properly, I get great results! But if I rush or do a step incorrectly, I find that I really don't get much in terms of results.   For me, I have to towel dry my hair until it's damp but not wet. Then I section it off, spray liberally, comb the product through and then use a round brush and blow dryer to dry each section, adding tension to the hair at the same time. I blow dry the top and bottom of each section.   If I do anything different - like apply the product when my hair is too wet or too dry, or use a different brush then the one I know works - I get okay results to no real results.   But do it correctly, take your time, and you will love your results and they do last 2 to 3 shampoos for me (I go a day between hair washings, usually).   One other thing to point out, is if you are in a rush and trying to just use a regular brush (like a Wet Brush) and blow dryer, you won't get the results you're looking for. Trust me on this one. And then you've wasted product and I find that, at least with this Extra Strength version, it tends to make my hair a bit tangled since it tends to weigh down the hair."

My hair came out frizzy, and because I had to use so much product (per the instructions) it left my hair feeling gummy.

What I like about this product is the lighweight feeling it gives my hair.  Other products have a certain tack when I run my hands through it, especially after blow drying.  The Color Wow does not have that feeling, my hair feels a lot cleaner.  Most of my frizz is gone, about 90%.  Also with my extended wash schedule, my hair is not as oil as it once was. I still have to run a flat iron through to get that silky and glassy feel it claims, but the style seems last through hot and humid Ohio Summer days. I also like that I don't have to use 3 or 4 products in combination to get medicore results.  Thus saving me money on product.  What I don't like is that I noticed that I have a lot more flyways and static after using this product, but it is manageable.  Also the ends of my hair seem to have a certain puff going on that was not there with other products.  It is also manageable, but I feel for the price tag, it should not do this.  This is why I knocked off a star and the flatiron business.  All in all, I would recommend this product. Overall I am pretty happy with the results and will continue using this."

The first time I used this product a few weeks ago I sprayed liberally in sections, brushed the product through, and blow dried the sections using my blow dryer and tension from my hairbrush. My hair ended up still very fluffy, and not sleek at all. This morning I tried again, spraying in sections and brushing through, and this time used my blow dry round brush to dry. It still ended up extremely puffy, and looks like how it always does after I blow dry without using any product.   I took this photo immediately after blow drying this morning; it looks like Iu2019m suffering from humidity and frizz rather than using a product that fights it!

I went to 3 different sephoras to find it because it was sold out... Hoping this would help me feel confident in this humidity but instead I am so sad. Disappointed and honestly feeling completely defeated. It says it's for curly and coily hair but it doesn't not work at all on coily African American hair. Please save your $35. There is nothing glass like or smooth about my hair, I flat ironed the hair in air conditioning and as soon as I open the door, window or go in The bathroom behind someone after a shower my hair  literally just shrivles back up. I've been carrying my flat iron to work each day to retouch  it once I get there even though I flat ironed it in the morning before leaving for work. The bottle says it's supposed to last days I don't even get 30 minutes. Very sad and a waste. I washed the hair, sectioned it towel dried, saturated with the product used a barrel brush to blow out any flat ironed my hair on 370u00b0. This does not work at all I still have to walk with a flat iron every day."

Trying to keep my hair straight after flat ironing it was impossible to the point where i stopped flat ironing my hair altogether. I recieved this complimentary from colorwow and wanted to see if it helped keep my hair straight all day long like people were saying. I usually don't blow dry my hair before straightening it but with this product, you really have to take the extra step to ensure your hair stays frizz free! It is activated with heat to seal the cuticles. My hair stayed shiny, soft, flat, and very manageable the following days which was way more than I expected out of this product unlike other products I've used. It smoothed out the frizz and  performed above and beyond my expectations."
