Very hard to comb/brush through and run my fingers through. I didnt like the feeling of it. Almost similar to washing your hair with shampoo only. I noticed some shine though to my hair which is nice but I feel like a hair gloss would definitely be better."

First I tried the regular version and I was really disappointed, but the extra strength does the job. My hair still gets some frizz and reverting towards roots and ends by the time Im back at home after a night out, but really will only ever need a little touch up the next day when I use this. Without it in my routine, its a noticeable difference now. The bottle lasts me about 3-4 styles, but i have A LOT of hair. If you have curly hair don't expect it to be invincible to humidity, but it makes maintaining a heated look easier 100% and is worth the money if you do it often. A tip I have is make sure you really do apply generously before u blowout your hair or its not going to do anything for you. I cant wait for that EXTRA EXTRA strength to come out LOL."

Now that I no longer work at Sephora this is actually one of the very few products I will ALWAYS repurchase. My hair is wavy in some areas and some areas are curly, dry, frizzy, and damaged. I have thin strands but a lot of them. I do not like the packaging of the big bottle so I pour it into my mini to spray. It does take half the bottle for my hair. Would give 4.5 stars strictly for the sprayer on the bigger bottle but the product itself is 10 stars! I use this when I straighten and I use the curly version when I air dry to keep my curls from getting frizzy. In the photo it is straight and so shiny but it doesn't feel sticky, tacky, or heavy."

It is a bit time consuming to apply because of needing to fully saturate all strands. I will also likely only get a few uses out of this bottle due to that. I cant give it a full 5 stars because of that, but Id be lying if I didnt say that I do think Dreamcoat is worth the hype in terms of results. I dont think it lasts through washing like it says, but thanks to not needing multiple styling products, I can go several days between washes without getting oily/hair feeling gross.

However, with Wow's Dream Coat applied my hair lasted for 5 days and that's only because I work out and I must wash my hair often. My strands were very smooth, soft, silky, and I had no frizz.

I mean, as soon as I used the product, I thought my hair had a heavier texture than normal, but the next day my hair was normal again. I generally use expensive and good products because I have chemicals in my hair, so I need to take care of it. So my hair is already very healthy.

Lately, its been raining and Ive been having really bad hair days so this spray came just in time to rescue my hair. Its had so much frizz, and flyaways, and is just unmanageable. Following the directions I washed, conditioned, and towel-dried my hair until it felt damp as suggested in the instructions. Next, I separated my hair into sections working with one section at a time. I liberally sprayed with Dream Coat and blow-dried and was amazed at the immediate difference I saw after doing the first section. I continued to spray and blow dry the remaining sections and was wowed by the results. My dull, dehydrated-looking hair has been transformed and I love how beautiful and healthy it looks. Its smooth and hydrated and all the frizziness and flyaway are gone. Dream Coat really lives up to its claim and I plan on purchasing more once Ive finished this bottle. Highly recommend. This product was gifted by colorwow"

My hair is fine, very dry and frizzy and before using this product, it was not attractive. I have always worn my hair in a pony tail or bun because it's the only way it looks decent. Extra Strength Dream Coat has changed that. I spray sections of my hair liberally while it's still damp. Blow dry/ straighten with a brush, using some tension, per the directions. AMAZING results! The hype is real! My hair is shiny, smooth, glossy and healthy! Most importantly, completely contained frizz and the results are long lasting! I use it again after 4 shampoos. Couldn't be happier with my fabulously moisturized hair! gifted by colorwow"

But I was very shocked and surprised after trying this product that it actually does what it claims to do. I live in the south and my hair is always exposed to extreme humidity. Usually about 10-20 mins after blow drying my hair it starts to show signs of exposure to humidity. I used dream coat as directed on the bottle and I am happy to say that my hair has remained frizz and poof free. Even after going to the gym and sweating profusely, my hair has stayed exactly how it was when I first dried it. This stuff is seriously a magic potion!

Just towel-drying my low porosity hair didn't work. I deep conditioned my hair and then air-dried my hair until it was nearly dry, not damp. That's key step 1. Key step 2:Working in 3-finger width sized sections of hair throughout, I sprayed Dream coat four times per section. I did not apply any other products because that's another key tip to make it work.  I blow dried each section on medium heat with a rounded boar brush. Key step 3: After I completed all the sections, and my hair and roots were completely dry and cooled, I then applied non water-based products, which is key step 4. The only thing I used next was a light application of a lightweight oil (sweet almond oil). Key step 5:I set my Babyliss flat iron to 300 so not to steam my hair. I chased the flat iron with a flat iron straightening comb. My hair looked like a professional silk press! My hair didn't revert, looked glossy and had body and movement.  It was a time consuming process but the end result was gorgeous. I highly recommend this and this was my first time ever using a Color Wow product. I received the product complimentary from the Color Wow for my honest opinion."

This lightweight spray works wonders by creating an invisible waterproofing cloak around each hair strand, effectively blocking humidity and eliminating frizz. The application process is simple: just spray on damp hair and then activate the product with heat from a blow dryer. The result is an incredibly smooth, silky finish that lasts through multiple shampoos. Although its on the pricier side, a little goes a long way, making it a worthwhile investment for those struggling with unruly hair. For best results, ensure your hair is thoroughly saturated and use every three to four washes. Highly recommended for anyone wanting to achieve long-lasting, frizz-free polish!"

I have very fine, thin, long hair. I find that if I take the time to apply and work this product properly, I get great results! But if I rush or do a step incorrectly, I find that I really don't get much in terms of results.   For me, I have to towel dry my hair until it's damp but not wet. Then I section it off, spray liberally, comb the product through and then use a round brush and blow dryer to dry each section, adding tension to the hair at the same time. I blow dry the top and bottom of each section.   If I do anything different - like apply the product when my hair is too wet or too dry, or use a different brush then the one I know works - I get okay results to no real results.   But do it correctly, take your time, and you will love your results and they do last 2 to 3 shampoos for me (I go a day between hair washings, usually).   One other thing to point out, is if you are in a rush and trying to just use a regular brush (like a Wet Brush) and blow dryer, you won't get the results you're looking for. Trust me on this one. And then you've wasted product and I find that, at least with this Extra Strength version, it tends to make my hair a bit tangled since it tends to weigh down the hair."

One wash is enough for my hair to go back to frizzy, so it is something I have to do every wash day."

What I like about this product is the lighweight feeling it gives my hair.  Other products have a certain tack when I run my hands through it, especially after blow drying.  The Color Wow does not have that feeling, my hair feels a lot cleaner.  Most of my frizz is gone, about 90%.  Also with my extended wash schedule, my hair is not as oil as it once was. I still have to run a flat iron through to get that silky and glassy feel it claims, but the style seems last through hot and humid Ohio Summer days. I also like that I don't have to use 3 or 4 products in combination to get medicore results.  Thus saving me money on product.  What I don't like is that I noticed that I have a lot more flyways and static after using this product, but it is manageable.  Also the ends of my hair seem to have a certain puff going on that was not there with other products.  It is also manageable, but I feel for the price tag, it should not do this.  This is why I knocked off a star and the flatiron business.  All in all, I would recommend this product. Overall I am pretty happy with the results and will continue using this."

The first time I used this product a few weeks ago I sprayed liberally in sections, brushed the product through, and blow dried the sections using my blow dryer and tension from my hairbrush. My hair ended up still very fluffy, and not sleek at all. This morning I tried again, spraying in sections and brushing through, and this time used my blow dry round brush to dry. It still ended up extremely puffy, and looks like how it always does after I blow dry without using any product.   I took this photo immediately after blow drying this morning; it looks like Im suffering from humidity and frizz rather than using a product that fights it!

I went to 3 different sephoras to find it because it was sold out... Hoping this would help me feel confident in this humidity but instead I am so sad. Disappointed and honestly feeling completely defeated. It says it's for curly and coily hair but it doesn't not work at all on coily African American hair. Please save your $35. There is nothing glass like or smooth about my hair, I flat ironed the hair in air conditioning and as soon as I open the door, window or go in The bathroom behind someone after a shower my hair  literally just shrivles back up. I've been carrying my flat iron to work each day to retouch  it once I get there even though I flat ironed it in the morning before leaving for work. The bottle says it's supposed to last days I don't even get 30 minutes. Very sad and a waste. I washed the hair, sectioned it towel dried, saturated with the product used a barrel brush to blow out any flat ironed my hair on 370u00b0. This does not work at all I still have to walk with a flat iron every day."

You just add the product before you blow dry. My hair felt softer and had an added shine right away. Normally I can tell when its about to rain because my hair becomes unruly and frizzy. We had a full day of rain after I applied this product the day before when the humidity was bad, my hair looked great even with the high humidity and the next day I was able to leave it as is. I would definitely recommend to anyone looking to tame unruly hair without a lot of extra time to do so."
