Usually spangly silver shades are too cool and blue for me to wear since I hate a frosty look, and the silvers in this palette all have some slightly different tint that pulls them away from pure blue-silver. Cant really speak for that glossy black shade  but it might be good for a very grungy look since it looks like it doesn't really set down by itself. Kind of same-y, so if you don't like gothy and not fully cool-toned looks then it's probably not for you."

I've used it almost every time I've done my makeup for the whole month since I bought it & Ive made a special point to try the cream a bunch of different ways. it's messy but imo it's supposed to be. I do make sure to pick it up w a clean finger or brush every time & I blow the powder shadows away from it after every use bc I don't want it to get gross or start growing anything like I've heard happening w creams in palettes. the mattes are nice & blendable, the shimmers are all different textures, so even the two silvers that appear similar in the pan don't look the same on the lids. overall, a great purchase BUT I knocked off a star for the high price tag. glad I waited for a sale"

I often wear shadow liner, and the black shade in this palette is very long wearing as an eyeliner, even when it is not set with a liquid on top. The black cream shadow also blends well but doesnu2019t budge when it dries down. I took a star off because the matte shades have more fallout than Iu2019m used to.  They can be a little messy to work with on the eye and they dust up the palette. They still provide enough pigment and I can work with them though."

Even if it is my brushes, it's way more than any of my other palettes from assorted other brands. The black powder, in particular, is TERRIBLE at getting absolutely everywhere, and impossible to get off once it does. It just smears. The other day I got home from work and had black eyeshadow dapples all along one cheek. No idea how. It doesn't stay in place once you put it on even if you DO manage to clean up all the fallout. The other colors crease or wear off pretty quickly. The glitters seem to have decent staying power, though. Overall, I love the colors, I love how pigmented they are and how smoothly they go on and blend, but they can't last through a work day and have crazy fallout. If I'm paying this much, I'll stick with Natasha Denona."

I would describe this as a staple neutral matte palette that has the addition of extra dark shades and a few silver shimmers. Two of the shimmers are more like sequin shades where the shimmer particles blend away on the eye, so most of the shades are effectively mattes. It only counts as cool for Huda, since most of their other palettes are orange and warm berry tones. I also would not purchase this as your main standalone palette, because the shimmer options are limited.   That said, I knew all of this going in from other reviews, and I'm very happy with the palette. Two of my staple matte palettes were expiring, and this is a good replacement with a transition shades in a variety of undertones. I use it as a companion palette with the more exciting shimmers in palettes like Rose Quartz as well as my indie shimmer singles."

I can subtle to dramatically grunge in minutes. Made for me! The pans are perfectly sized and the colors are so pigmented but buttery soft to blend. No issues! Iu2019m a beginner when it comes to a dramatic eye but with practice Iu2019ll be able to create some super sexy eyes! The pictures do not do this palette justice, even the packaging is rockin! My only small complaint is one pan came damaged from how it was shipped. Easy fix, not worried about it because itu2019s still usable."

            "review_text": "The palette case is hard plastic with a click-snap closure that feels very secure. The text on the case is a reflective mirror which is a nice touch, and the inside of the case lid has a full mirror above the shadows. The shadows are clearly labeled, and they look attractive together in the palette. However, I did have one shadow that came cracked (Rebelle), and Grunge had small bubbles or oily dots that were probably caused by temperature changes. There are some cooler shades on the right side of the palette (such as Beauty Chaos and Freedom), but most shades lean warmer. Although Liberty looked like a pinky mauve to me initially, it showed up a bit orangish on my lids. I used my regular eyeshadow primer before applying, and the shadows were very pigmented. They felt creamy (even though they are mostly powders) and blended well. I used Renegade with an angled brush as a liner. I liked the softer charcoal liner look it created, but I did experience a lot of fallout during application and needed to clean up my under eyes afterwards. The glitter shadows in this palette really stood out to me! I love Stand Up and Maverick which create equally shimmery metallic shades, one of which is more gold and one of which is more silver. Theyu2019re all very glittery, although I found that Avant Garde didnu2019t create as much sparkle as the other glitters in the palette. Iu2019ve been having fun playing around with different looks ranging from pretty, to grunge, to various blends of the two, and look forward to trying more looks with it!"

I hate when people say kickback is indicative of quality, because it is NOT. Also love the cream shadow in this palette too. I uss it as eyeliner and thereu2019s no raccoon eyes at the end of the day, and I also mix it with the brown shade in this palette to make my own u201cbrow pomade.u201d I just wish there was a cover over the cream shade.
