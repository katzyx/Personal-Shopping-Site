On my skin, thereu2019s a slight cherry scent, but itu2019s more medicinal, like cough syrup, rather than sweet or tart. The almond note feels synthetic and lacks warmth, reminding me of Jergens lotion rather than something cozy or inviting. The incense and peru balsam notes really ruin this fragrance. Overall, the scent is quite powdery and dense, similar to older perfumes that have a strong powder and alcohol smell. Itu2019s also very potent, and I think layering it with other products would only intensify the heaviness. While the packaging is beautiful, the fragrance itself didnu2019t live up to my expectations."

The cherries add this beautiful fragrance boost in the first moments of wearing before it settles into this seduction of vanilla and spice. Itu2019s one for the handbag thatu2019s for sure and has garnered me many compliments!"

It mostly smells like vanilla with a masculine touch to it which lasts a really long time. The smell lingers for a long time; especially where I sprayed it. This is definitely perfect for evening wear and the upcoming colder temperatures we are about to face in NYC. The best way I can describe this smell is sexy. With the black cherry giving it more weight to the smell and the vanilla giving it some softness and elegance to it. The spray comes out very light and its mist covers a lot of area wherever you apple it. This is a fantastic gift for yourself and itu2019s easy to carry in your purse or store in your locker or office whenever you want to re-apply."
