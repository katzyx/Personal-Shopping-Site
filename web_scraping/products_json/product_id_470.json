After using it a few times, I noticed a boost in volume that didnu2019t feel artificial or forcedu2014it was like my hair had a natural fullness to it, which is so hard to achieve with thick, wavy hair like mine!  The formula itself is a dream. It cleanses my scalp thoroughly without stripping away my natural oils, leaving my hair soft and hydrated. I also love that itu2019s silicone-free, vegan, cruelty-free, and color-safeu2014so itu2019s gentle on both my hair and the environment.  Now, letu2019s talk results: The volume this shampoo gives is legit. My roots have that weightless lift, and my hair overall feels plumper and more bouncy. Plus, thanks to the onion juice and amla, thereu2019s a noticeable shine that makes my hair look healthy and vibrant.  If youu2019re on the hunt for a volumizing shampoo that delivers without compromising on hydration, this is definitely worth adding to your hair care routine. Fable & Mane nailed it with this oneu2014itu2019s all about healthy, full-bodied hair without the fuss!"

Noticed my hair was starting to fall out in bigger chunks- decided to put a little money into my hair and it was a great decision!  My Hair dresser immediately noticed my hair was so much more healthy than using the cheaper shampoo and conditioner.  I am going to try the hydrating version next but really thats just out of curiosity. it's expensive but this bottle will last me 2 months no problem. I have long thick hair so that's pretty amazing. bonus! my husband loves the smell"

The fragrance makes me long for travel and adventure to sultry and exotic places where I could easily picture myself being a heroine in an epic story. I donu2019t think I have ever described hair products before that way but it is where my mind wanders when using these.   The shampoo is geared towards fine  to medium hair with the ingredients focused on filling out and strengthening the strands as well as nourishing them.    I was honestly surprised by how full and voluminous my hair was after use.  I have fairly fine hair with type 2C/3A curls. I would normally have to use a lot of styling products to get my hair this full looking.  This is absolutely a win in my book for volume, fragrance and overall quality of ingredients."

The promise of fuller-looking hair had me intrigued, and this duo delivered beyond my expectations. Starting with the Volumizing Shampoo, I loved the rich lather it created with just three pumps. The scent was delightful and calming, making the whole experience feel luxurious. As I massaged it from roots to ends, I noticed it cleansed my hair thoroughly without leaving it dry or stripped of its natural moisture. The fenugreek seeds and amla extracts worked wonders, giving my hair a noticeable body and shine after just one wash. The Volumizing Conditioner was equally impressive. After rinsing out the shampoo, I applied the conditioner from mid-lengths to ends, as suggested. The black seed extract and amla made my hair feel incredibly soft and bouncy. I waited for a minute before rinsing, and the difference was remarkable. My hair felt fuller, more elastic, and had a lovely shine that lasted all day. Overall, this Fable and Mane duo is a game-changer for anyone looking to add volume and shine to their hair. The Ayurvedic ingredients make it a high-performance, silicone-free option that leaves your hair feeling rejuvenated and full of life."

I tried it on a blow-dry day, a wavy airdry day, and a lazy day where I just let my hair dry without product after and liked the outcome on all days. I do have a few notes to share on it.   I don't think this is a volumizing shampoo. To me, it performs more like a thickening shampoo.  My hair feels PLUMP and thick after, not like a traditional volumizing shampoo that leaves hair super cleansed and bouncy. This left my hair feeling moisturized, like I could skip shampoo.   The shampoo has a really low lather, very small bubbles, kinda feels velvetty when you lather in your hair. I definitely needed three pumps to wash my longer the shoulders hair. Speaking of pumps, the pumps are very hard to press down with one hand, I wish they pumped a bit more easily and it makes me think it's not the best packaging for the formula.   I love the scent, and as someone where scent doesn't stick to my hair well, I felt like I could smell it in my hair after I styled which means whatever fragrance they use it high-quality.   Overall, I really like this shampoo and would repurchase it! It makes me want to try other products from Fable and Mane."

This shampoo comes in a beautifully designed bottle that immediately gives off a luxurious vibe. The scent is delightful, a subtle blend of botanical and earthy notes that make the washing experience feel like a spa treatment.  My hair type is fine and tends to be a bit flat, especially at the roots. I always look for products that can add some volume without weighing my hair down or making it greasy.  Upon using the Fable and Mane Volumizing Shampoo, I noticed how rich and creamy the lather was. It felt nourishing but not heavy, and it spread easily through my hair. After rinsing, my hair felt clean but not stripped of its natural oils.  Once my hair dried, it felt noticeably lighter and fuller. There was a definite lift at the roots, and my hair had a natural, healthy shine. The volume lasted throughout the day, and my hair remained soft and manageable.  Overall, the Fable and Mane Volumizing Shampoo exceeded my expectations. It provided a good amount of volume, left my hair feeling clean and healthy, and had a pleasant scent that lingered subtly. I would highly recommend it to anyone with fine hair looking for a bit more lift and fullness."

I appreciate that Fable and Mane use ingredients like fenugreek, which is known to support hair growth. It feels like they're truly invested in hair health, not just quick fixes. Overall, I'm hooked! This shampoo tackles my greasy roots and adds volume, all while smelling great and promoting healthy hair. I'll definitely be repurchasing."

Since using, my hair has more noticeable body and shine. The texture is creamy and lathers beautifully with just a few pumps. After rinsing, my hair feels refreshed and fuller, yet still soft. It doesn't strip away natural oils; instead, it leaves my hair perfectly balanced and ready for styling, without the usual flatness. It's my go-to for that extra boost of volume without compromise."
