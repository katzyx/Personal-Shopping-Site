I like the black color for seeing my products!!!  Beauty Blenders are more expensive than their competitors for sure, but they are also better quality and last longer, so in the long run, you aren't paying more as I don't need to replace them as often."

Then I LIGHTLY bounce the sponge to blend my makeup (this is essentially no added pressure but just allowing it to bounce on my skin).

I most certainly would NOT recommend purchasing this but rather opting for a less porous (?) sponge - something like the Ibra Marble Beauty Blender or the Make Up For Ever HD Skin Sponge. These do not absorb makeup and work very well to spread product and blend evenly."

(Purchased through Ulta) anyhow I usually prefer a brush but on occasion I like to switch it up depending on my coverage level. However I am no newbie when it comes to make up sponges. Iu2019ve tried real techniques, Fenty Beauty and E.L.F to say the least and all Iu2019ve had enjoyed using. Lately I have wanted to try out the BB since I never had and wanted to see if there was any difference and if it was worth the 20$ price tag attached to it. Given all the hype I drove my butt over to Ulta and purchased one. My choices were the OG pink blender, some pink orange swirled blender and the the beauty blender pro black. I had seen a influencer on YT rave about the black one over the pink so I decided black it is. Upon taking it out of the package I noticed it felt soft and squishy but a little more pourous compared to other blenders Iu2019ve tried. Honestly I thought Fenty felt squisher than this one but went ahead and ran it under the faucet, rung it out and put it in a towel to soak up any excess water so it would perform its best. Let me tell you this thing sucked up all the foundation I put on my face and did not distribute evenly. I applied another layer just for it to look good in some places and so patchy in others. Never in my life had I had such a issue blending out my foundation. I had to use 3x the amount as normal just to achieve my desired coverage which is insane because I usually use 2 pumps all together one for each side of my face. Sometimes not even that many. I tried it 3 more times after thinking it might have a learning curve but no! This thing just sucks. Iu2019m glad to see other reviews talking about the cheap feeling and how it performed bad. For 20$ bucks I at least expect this thing to do its job. I like the ELF total face sponge waaaaayyy more than this and itu2019s 4$ at Walmart. Needless to say save your coins!!!!"

I had tried a bunch of drugstore/affordable beauty sponges that just couldn't compare. But when I stocked up on this recently, I noticed it wasn't the same sponge anymore. It didn't feel the same way - it was too dense and hard, absorbed way too much product, the material was not as soft and flexible - it felt like every other sponge I had tried and not loved - which at $20 per sponge, I am NOT down for.  When I got home, I even wet my old sponge I was replacing and compared them side by side and realized they were not the same sponge even though they were both black beauty blenders. What's going on!? Will not be repurchasing."

I usually use cheaper ones but theyu2019ve been tearing rather quick. I saw these are supposed to last a few months rather than the few weeks my cheaper ones last. So I figured why not. This is now my fav bc it applies foundation a bit better than the others in my opinion. It doesnu2019t soak up too much product and it doesnu2019t lift anything. For example, I noticed when I tried to apply liquid highlight with my cheap sponge it would lift product up. Same when Iu2019d try to build up foundation sometimes. That issue didnu2019t happen at all when using this one. I also prefer size and shape of this one compared to others. Others Iu2019ve tried to fit well under my eye unless I pinch it together. This is perfect size. Only reason I took off a star is bc of the price. $20 is a bit steep for a sponge. My rationale for paying close to that is that Iu2019ll get a few months use instead of buying cheaper $5 ones every few weeks."

I don't know how, but it's definitely different. I just recently purchased a holiday set that included the punk and yellow BB, and I do enjoy the set and feel it was worth the price, but I also just purchased another pro BB and it's doing what the other can't. I don't enjoy storing the BB because I feel like it's difficult to find a sanitary method, but I've been using the B pro for about 2 years now and it leaves my makeup flawless. I use it mainly for concealer and to give my skin one last blend before I set my face. It's worth the $20."

I then use my BB by tapping it all over my skin to blend and sink my foundation into my skin.  I will repeat these steps a second time usually with much less foundation than the first time and  just in areas that need more coverage..  Then the foundation will give me a full coverage look and is completely blended into my skin giving me flawless looking skin. Your skin will not look cakey!  If it does then use a lot less foundation in each layer."

Mine have not torn and I wash them after and before every use.  Still, for someone that still has to pay someone to do her makeup, every professional MUA that has worked on my face has sworn by this specific beautyblender and mostly because of how often they use it and the numerous clients that they use it on that have different skin needs, young and old.  It gets the job done.   I like the PRO so much that I also purchased the huge flat sponge, the bodyblender...

Brushes just suck; they always leave my face streaky, make you lose product, and never good at getting medium/full coverage.  This beauty blender is phenomenal, thereu2019s nothing like it, not even the knock off brands come close to this beauty blender.  It works best when wet and itu2019s a little more firm than the original B.B.  which I say is better for full makeup looks.  Itu2019s easy to clean out and lasts a LONG time (so long as you clean it regularly!).  Itu2019s so easy to use and easy to hold.  Your makeup will look flawless with this and will minimal makeup loss.  I suggest using the stippling method with this as well.  The texture is great and isnu2019t as porous as you may think.  Itu2019s still a sponge, but the foundation doesnu2019t sink to the center like you may think.  Iu2019ve cut up my old one which Iu2019ve had for a year, and the center was completely untouched by foundation (even without regular cleaning).  Offbrand BB soak up way more foundation, and donu2019t blend as nicely, and arenu2019t as clean.  Definitely save up for this brand, because once you try it, youu2019ll understand why this is a MUST-HAVE for everyone who uses foundation.  The tip is super easy to use to get around your nose too and corners of your eye! Give this a try and youu2019ll never want to go back to your hands/brush.  If for some reason this doesnu2019t work for you, Sephora has a great return policy.  I strongly believe everyone should at least give a B.B. one try to really understand how good it is."

I know all beautyblenders should technically be the same, but they vary slightly in texture and I've found this one to be perfect for me! The pro seems to expand more to me while still being the right balance between bounce and dense."

You canu2019t expect the sponge to not absorb any product but I do feel that when applying my foundation or concealer the beauty blender sponge absorbs the least product meaning your saving more money in the long run!

I've had the black one for about a year (and I clean my sponges after every use and make sure that they're manipulated gently) and used it as much as the original... the damage is not comparable. Beauty Blender should definitely make an economic duo bundle for the pro one like they did with the original because I would be all over it!"

I get a flawless, seamless, smooth application every single time. Yes, it's $20 but this is a holy grail tool you will reach for every single time you do your makeup. They are extremely long-lasting and durable if you take care of them. I use my BB to apply my foundation, concealers, and even my powder highlight (try it, ladies, you won't regret it).

My only complaint with this product is when Iu2019ve sat down at my vanity and Iu2019ve primed and Iu2019m ready to play and I have to get up to wet my beauty blender. Haha oh well.

I had already bought the black one, as I had expected my bb to be done months before it was. Anyway, I won't be able to see if it growing something on it and won't really know when to toss this one. So, I would prefer to buy a light color next time, even though it does look kind of yucky with the make up on it (which is why I bought black this time around).

I like the fact it is black because all beauty blenders are super hard to get completely clean and at least this one looks clean after a good wash. I took good care of it and it lasted about five months but then it started leaving little black specks on my face and I knew it was time to get rid of it. I couldn't justify spending another 32$ on a new one, that's about 5$ a month on a sponge. I have since bought a knockoff and while it isn't as good as the true beautyblender it's lasted much longer and was a fraction of the price."

It's still a perfect sponge but knew I needed to get a new one because I could tell mold was growing inside from being used almost everyday (that happens after a while because you can't get them to dry immediately after use) so I ordered it again. The quality is nearly that of a disposable sponge which is unacceptable for the price. It wastes foundation & when you're blending over it picks up & leaves it to make foundation look uneven. Not to mention it leave black sponge specks behind :( I'm sad about this because I was really looking forward to the same quality of the old version. Also it was misshaped on the bottom & not perfectly round.. Needless to say I'm not giving up on the brand because I had rely heavily on this sponge so I'm returning immediately after I get the original one in the mail."

I simply spray it a few times with setting spray, squeeze it to spread the moisture, and then bounce away.

This review is for the black 'pro' BB, as I have found it to be somehow even better than the original pink and the nude which I've also tried. As a full disclaimer, I might be feeling this way because its a fresh blender after using my previous pink one till it had chunks in it (I clean it religiously each time before using, don't think I'm gross). However, the black version is so soft and fluffy and while I'll see if it stays this way over time, I'll be buying only this color from here on out. Another advantage to this pro color is that it doesn't look dirty and stained (which the other colors do look like over time despite daily washing).   TL;DR Buy a beauty blender if you haven't already, and if you're wondering which color to get, try the black 'pro'! (You won't go wrong with any color, though)."
