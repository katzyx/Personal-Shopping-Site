The mask is comfortable and makes me feel like I'm going to the spa for 3 minutes daily. I can't wait to see my results after a longer period of use! This product is PRICEY and I almost didn't splurge, but I thought...I'm WORTH it!!! I'm glad I made the purchase."

            "review_text": "Mask is just pink, thought the black in the pictures made it look cool, but it's Matte pink and shiny pink only.  Straps now have bumps and are not smooth, so I'm thinking this helps solve the strap issues from the original.  Had an issue switching between red and blue light, but that was user error, and their phone customer service was fantastic.   Have been doing light therapy for over a year, but my project E mask quit working, so I decided to upgrade.  Nice that this one came with some skincare products as well.  No real complaints except it doesn't look exactly like the picture.   So much more comfortable than my previous mask."
