Although I couldn't find this specific shade on the website, the cream glow blush stick glides on easily on my skin without looking patchy. Since Courageous is the second brightest color, I was cautious and applied a small amount on my hand to test it out. After that, I picked up the product with a sponge and applied it to my cheeks. The blush stick also gives a nice highlight effect, so I don't need to use a highlighter separately. This makes it a perfect two-in-one product. Moreover, the highlight is more of a light shimmer that doesn't look too thick, which I prefer because it doesn't showcase my skin pores."

You can swipe these sticks straight on to your cheeks for a bold look or use a brush to pick up color from the blush stick before applying it to your cheeks for a more subdued look.  You can easily twist up the stick to access more product and twist it down to secure it inside the cap so no blush accidentally gets scraped off the side.  The blush is velvety smooth and doesnu2019t dry down quickly so you have time to blend.  The finish of the blush gives a dewy, hydrated effect to the face.  There is no visible glitter or shimmer.

I just started wearing blush the past year and I have a very fair complexion. The shade looked too dark at first. Wbefore applying it, I sprayed my face with a setting spray then added so of the blush stick. I then sprayed a beauty blender with the setting spray and patted it while I was blending it. A little goes a long way. With that said, a stick will probably last a year! Highly recommended!!"
