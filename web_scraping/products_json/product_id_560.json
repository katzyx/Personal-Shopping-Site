            "review_text": "This is by far the best hair tool I have found for my thinning hair.  I have lost so much of it and didn't want to keep styling it with a blow dryer and round brush or anything that tugs too much, or excessive heat, i.e: first blow dry for volume, then style with curling iron or flat iron, etc.  I tried this and it's been the tool that has replaced everything else.  I still have my blow dryer for when I don't want to style and only dry my hair.  But this has been a game-changer for me.  It gives beautiful volume and is actually pretty versatile when it comes to the curls you want.  You can go from really tight curls to soft gorgeous waves.  The style lasts until I wash and I have tried this on my family relatives who have completely different hair than I do, thicker, thinner, straight, wavy, etc., and it works just as well.  HOWEVER, I will say, it definitely has a learning curve!  You have to get the hang of it and make sure your hair is detangled before going in, otherwise you will snag and tangle your hair and it will be a mess.  There are some tutorials on YouTube that are helpful but, you do have to be somewhat savvy with hair tools.  That's my only complaint because a lot of people will miss out or think this tool is terrible lol  But if you can get the hang of it, it's a staple of a tool.  I've had it for 3 years now and it has lost two teeth but it's nothing detrimental, it still works wonders and I do use it A LOT! On myself and my family."

It leaves my hair much bouncier than using a flat iron and it's faster and easier than a curling iron. I'm incredibly impressed with how easy it is and with the results. The style lasts through day 2 for me and looks amazing. I did watch all instructional videos before using it and the method for holding it was already similar to other styling in my routine so holding this hot brush feels easy to me (sort of like using a denman brush and a flat iron at the same time). I also find it works best when paired with the B&B oil primer."

Also, this holds my curls for an entire day at work and without any hairspray! Part of the reason why i stopped curling my hair with a curling iron is because it would always fall flat even if i used hairspray. This is different than a traditional curling iron with a clamp. its a little more versatile since you can use it to style your hair in different ways besides curls. you just have to make sure your hair is really smooth and brushed out before using it or it MAY get tangled! But i still prefer this instead of a curling iron or wand."

I was looking for something to add body to my hair and that would be able to create different styles. The ghd rise delivered beyond my expectations. So far after just my first time playing with it, I was able to create three different looks that were absolutely perfect and so easy to create. Straight with body and a little curl at the end (blowout kind of look), old Hollywood style curls, and the most stunning beach waves. Seriously, it looks better than when my hairstylist waves it! I just hold the ghd rise near the root and wrap it once, then pull and twist down the hair. And every single strand came out perfectly the same. For the old Hollywood curls, comb through from root to tip and roll it back up the hair once you get to the end and hold, then unroll it. And for the straight look, just comb through and give it a flick at the end. Not only did the styles come out nicer than with the dyson or even my traditional curling iron, but they actually held way better, too. Supposedly itu2019s the perfect temperature to get hold while not causing damage to the hair. I mean itu2019s definitely higher heat than the airwrap since thatu2019s just a blow dryer basically, but I didnu2019t feel like my hair was in bad shape after using it. So hopefully thatu2019s true. Seems like it. Plus the airwrap styles took ten years to create then fell out of my hair within ten minutes no joke. As far as it pulling hair out, I didnu2019t experience that whatsoever. It may be a hair type thing. For reference, my hair is fine, long, straight to wavy,  and bleached. All in all, itu2019s the easiest and most versatile hair tool Iu2019ve ever used. Iu2019ve never been able to create these styles as nicely with any other tool."

The first time I used it, I looked a hot mess. There is absolutely a learning curve of about two uses, but it is WORTH IT if you struggle with volume.   The way I use this now, is by blowing out or rough drying my hair, adding a heat protectant, separating my hair, and curling just my ends, which creates a beautiful wave that turns into a bouncy blowout look. I use it at the crown and lift horizontally, hold, and drop back down and the volume is gorgeous. Looks like a lovely salon blowout. The waves you can create are gorgeous too, so it's a multifunctional tool for blowout looks, waves, and/or volume. Try it out, don't give up, don't let the bad reviews sway you and stick with it. So worth.   Also for reference my hair is thin and at my shoulders."

First time I used it, I noticed my hair was a little more staticky, but Iu2019ve started to use a prep spray on my dry hair first and that stopped. The lift at the roots is amazing and the body of the curl lasts until the next day. I can use it to add some quick lift and bounce or I can use it for curls and both look great. Like this better than my Bioionic flat iron and the Dyson! I like it more and more every time I use it!"

My other hot brush died and so I found this looking for a replacement. This brush does so much more than the description says!!! I was a little wary of the price and if it would work like I hoped because I wasnu2019t looking for volume. I had guessed/hoped it would work like this: I used this on my air dried curly hair as I would use a hot brush but handled it like I would a round brush and I am in love!!! It tamed the curl like a flat hot brush but then I was able to add soft curls to the ends beautifully. If you already used round brush to dry, hot brush to tame and curler to finish this replaces all and with minimal learning curve. Note: to only be used on dry hair"

            "review_text": "I love what this hot brush did for my long thick but fine textured and limp hair.  While it didn't give me the body  at the roots I had hoped (back brushing/teasing did) I loved how it smoothed my frizzy ends and tamed my locks.  It did give me body around my ends and it didn't take away volume like some devices will.  Nothing but back brushing as shown in the video gives me lift at the root.    If I use a flat iron for smoothing my hair as advertised goes completely flat and I lose the bounce I love from the blowdryer.    I have tried many different hot tools and have collect quite the graveyard of unused devices in an attempt to tame my frizzy unmanageable hair without luck.  With the GHD round brush,  I tried doing my hair like in the video, separating it into sections and wrapping the hair around the wand close to the roots but I didn't get the body or structure I wanted.  However to my surprise,  when I simply brushed it around my hair cupping the ends around the wand the results were nothing short of astonishing.   I got the smoothing I desired and a bit of bounce and curl on my ends in mere seconds.  I can fix my hair in way less than 5 minutes with this device.   I would say it takes me about 2 minutes.   The only caveat is that it gets extremely hot and has no thermostat to help you control the heat.   But I don't have to make multiple passes to get the results I want either so I am hoping that I won't get damage because I am going to want to use it daily.   I highly recommend using a  product that protects your hair from heat damage though, but that is always a good idea even if you are only using the blowdryer.  I can't recommend this device enough especially for those with long hair who want to keep that just blowdried bounce or get it back a day later.   I am not a professional or tried it on different types of hair but I have a feeling it will be useful to women with short hair as well.   I am buying one for my daughter today, I am that impressed."
