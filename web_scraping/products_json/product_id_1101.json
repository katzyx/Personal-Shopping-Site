Let me tell you my husband rarely compliments my perfumes as I tend to stick to fruity body sprays. He couldn't get enough of this smell. And I agree with him, the smell is beautiful, modern, fresh yet has sophisticated notes as well. On our date someone else complimented the smell and described it as a grown up successful rich baddie smell. I recommend this perfume and I already purchased the full size."

It gives sophistication, a mature  working woman, eluding confidence and grounded in her roots; one who dares to be different but still values tradition.   Initially, in my unboxing review, I described this as cosmetic smelling.  From the top note, it smells like an addictive lipstick that you have to smell every time you reapply. It also has a bitter, dry opening of vintage, fade mothball-like aroma, but not in a bad way, though. As it dries down an hour into wear, you can definitely smell subtle sweetness of cotton candy and violet. A slight green, pear skin scent is present. The vanilla is absent. The moss peeks through in the base notes along with subtle jasmine. I think this is where others are describing a hint of crayon smell mixed with cough syrup. To me, it smells purple, like violet.  My husband says it smells like a frosted evergreen ud83cudf32 and he approves. He isn't smelling mothballs, lipstick, or Crayola Crayons for the record. It's a very unique and interesting scent.   Clarins used to have a fragrance  about 20 years ago that this smells rather similar to it, but currently, there isn't anything like it."

But the beginning notes were just not it. As I've worn it through the week, it's grown on me. People have hugged me or passed by me and immediately wanted to know what I was wearing.

There was no self tanner smell from the sample. I really wish there would have been a sample or travel size available. I have read that maybe it's the ph interaction on my skin. So now I only spray it on my clothes. If it hadn't have been so expensive I would just toss it. No returns either.  Honest review is that if they would take out the note that smells like self tanner or nasty body odor, I'd be so much more happier and probably keep wearing this fragrance from now on. The other notes are like heaven and must be what the sample concentration smells like. If only..."

The next day I applied the perfume, waited until the top notes had dissipated (20 minutes, then another 2 hours), and was left with a very nice sophisticated fragrance. It's not a youthful scent, but I don't find it to be an old lady scent either. It's more of a scent I'd associate with a successful, classy woman. It is appropriate for day or night, and the scent lasts for 12+ hours on skin and longer on fabric. I think the bottle design matches the essence of the fragrance well. I really wish there was a travel size of this because paying so much for a bottle I'll never be able to finish is a bit ridiculous.  Note: I received a sample as a gift-with-purchase."

It's a clean scent, not thick and creamy, like a skin scent.  I can smell this on me for over 12 hrs from initial spray, without reapplying. The fruity, floral, spicy, warm, sweet, musky and woody notes are blended so well that one note doesn't seem to overpower another, at least not to me. It does seem like a mature scent and I think people thirty years of age, and over, may truly appreciate it.

I am an average consumer and lover of Merit, as an almost 40 year old woman I GET the Merit esthetic. This perfume is a good representation of the brand, sophisticated, geared towards a more mature individual, someone who appreciates simple but essential  products, that just deliver. This perfume opens with a clean pear scent that could be done badly, but this smells like what you would imagine the JUICIEST pear you have ever smelled to be. The dry down is a clean, light, skin musk. I find the older I get, my once beloved fragrances cause me headaches or an overwhelming pressure feeling in my sinus, this doesn't. It will be the scent I reach for when going to the office or on days I want to have an aura of fresh scent around me, that I catch a whiff of every now and then. It's very Merit, not overwhelming, but subtlety impacts and enhances the wearer. Hope that helps!"

As it dried down, it just simply smelled like baby powder. The more hydrated I was, the longer the scent lasted but my body chemistry did not play nicely with the fragrance. It did remind me of a fragrance a more mature woman would be sporting. I will not be purchasing for myself as I prefer gourmand fragrances and I thought I'd get that with the vanilla base, but that was not the case for me. I would recommend requesting a sample first instead of a blind buy."

For reference my current fav for the past year and half has been D&G's Queen- I also really liked the Selena Gomez perfume spray that came with the hand lotion duo this year! I just got Vice Vice Baby from Sniff and I'm into it, so this Merit scent is right up my alley! I find it delicious and addictive. I'm the type of person to get headaches/migraines very easily by scents/heavy perfume and sometimes even certain fresh or cooked food aromas- I have to be selective with my fragrances (walking into a Sephora is a nightmare for me- I really wish they had a separate room/cube that keeps the fragrance department separate!) The sample I have is from a recent GWP promo, and the sample is pretty substantial- the packaging is reminiscent of the Aerin by Estee Lauder samples available a few years ago. Tiny glass vials with an actual cap, lovely to keep in a purse for touch ups. I remember even buying a mini/sample set from the Aerin line that had like 5 or 6 of this style vials. I still have them actually, and I will probably have this Merit sample for ever as well! I hope this review helps somebody? Idk if their promo code is still active but if it is, try it. :)"

I believe the negative reviews are coming from people used to what currently constitutes an IT fragrance: food smells so chemically charged that they make you smell like a cake all day. The Merit scent is classic. It's something you could see Elizabeth Taylor or Marilyn Monroe wearing. It's very Chanel No.5, classic scent-y, but the pear adds vibrance and a youthful, modern twist.  It's more something I could see the European market appreciating, not the Bath and Body Works crazy North American market. It's a refined smell and carries a quiet dignity but immortal aura. It smells expensive. I am a fan, but I'll agree, the price for 30mL is steep."

I ended up returning the unopened perfume the next day because as the tester spray settled on my skin over the next few hours, it smelled less and less complex and just overall very sweet. And then it reminded me way too much of Mugler Alien (purple bottle, very Jasmine forward), and somehow the way Glossier You smells on me after a couple hours - two perfumes I enjoy, except the Merit did NOT smell nearly as good in comparison to those two. I couldn't justify keeping this. I really felt this was not a unique perfume, and the cost *per ounce* is very high. I also think the 30% jasmine oil content could be potentially sensitizing or irritating to some people's skin over time, so I don't see that as an advantage. Still, if you like jasmine and you don't own any jasmine heavy perfumes and you don't mind the price, you might like this."

Went in to buy the foundation stick, Glossier You and ended up snagging the last perfume and RETURNED my Glossier You First spritz, PEAR, incredibly fresh and transeasonal. AMBROX - the most present scent in Glossier You  As it settles: Pear is COMPLETELY GONE --- which is really disappointing as it smells gorgeous, BUT the scent that settles is a little more musky, a little powdery, like soft, warm sensual skin that holds a touch of freshness, its BORDERING on granny, but a step below in a way that gives mysterious hot girl I reapplied this twice in one day which I felt had the best impact. I  would say it lasts all day if you only care for close contact scents, but I re-sprayed because I DID want it to linger a bit more. Price... going to see how this goes but Im worried down the road I wont be able to justify the cost -- mind you in transitioning from Glossier You, 100ml at a similar price, to this extract at 30ml."

The marketing team deserves it all because I WANTED this so badly but it did not live up to the hype. I bought this with my own money, hoping for a soft, clean feminine scent with a hint of that bright pear. I also loved hearing it compared to an older version of Glossier's You (and I admit, I can see how that makes sense in that it is a skin scent but more for 40-50's IMO). However, this is what it actually smells like:  My grandmother's bathroom counter and memory of sifting through her drawer of scarves as a kid. Or my mom's makeup bag, with loose powders, eye shadows, and tubes of lipstick that have been in there for a while.  The pear comes through for initial spray, as in literally before it even lands on your skin you can smell it but it disappears instantly. You're left with a really heavy powder scent with slight white florals. No fruit, no vanilla for me. Just powdery, slightly warm musk. It lasts about 8 hours and does travel through the room nicely so I'll give it points for longevity I guess. Also points for the gorgeous bottle which is heavy and feels luxurious. After everything, My mom (58yo) said smells like a doctors office, my three year old said smells bad, and my husband said nope."

I love all sorts of Merit products and when I heard they came out with a perfume I got really excited.   Itu2019s a great fall and spring scent. Not too strong, but Iu2019ll reapply it at least once throughout the day. It has this warm and soft/clean undertone to it (on my skin). Very mature and classy  The packaging is quality and clean. The bottom is glass and the top is heavy, nothing cheap.  Price is on the pricey side, but so is the brand."

Love their makeup and their skincare and so I had really high hopes for their first fragrance. I'm hugely disappointed. The scent isn't terrible, but it's nothing new and it really does smell old fashioned, but not in the good, retro kind of way they were aiming for. It really just smells like an old, out-of-fashion perfume, and smells weirdly stale on me. Again, it's not horrific, but this would not be something I'd be tempted to reach for, I just think there are so many nicer everyday type of skin scents out there to choose from. For the size and the price point I just don't think it's worth it. Maybe I'm in the minority on this, or maybe the honest reviews haven't started flowing yet, but I would just say to smell it before you buy it. I gave two stars because if you do happen to like it, the longevity is amazing! I scrubbed and scrubbed and could not get it off. Also the packaging is beautiful, like everything Merit. Overall though, this is a rare miss from them."

I was attracted to the beautiful bottle and was excited to see that one of the notes listed was an ambrette, one of my favorites. The composition seemed familiar, and I expected it to be something I had smelled before and liked, so I ordered the perfume. It arrived, and I found the bottle very pretty but small, at only 1 ounce. I had difficulty opening the cap as it was a little awkward. I sprayed it once, and the atomizer worked nicely. The scent is very similar to Diptyque Fleur de Peau EDP. I would even consider it a dupe. This perfume gives a pleasant scent bubble (people will smell you at arm's length). Longevity is strong; this will last you all day, nose to skin 8+"

If you are younger or older I think you would enjoy it as well due to it mixing differently with everyone's body chemistry. Definitely give it a try!

But that quickly goes away and once it dries down, I get a beautiful warm and slightly spicy scent that I really like. At times, it reminds me of a more gender neutral cologne which is not something I usually gravitate towards, but I'm also not mad about it. I personally do not pick up the fruity notes that are mentioned (bergamot/pear).  Overall, I am very pleased with this perfume! It is so timeless and addictive. I feel classy when I wear it and literally cannot stop smelling my wrists."

Then that went away and it basically became a toned-down version of You (Glossier). I'm not getting any of the listed base notes. It was fun to smell how it changes over time. But nothing about it seems unique or a complement getter like other people are claiming. Bottle looks stunning though, like a curved version of Orabella. I'm already wondering what the flankers are going to smell like."

Itu2019s mature enough to wear at night or in more professional settings, but it doesnu2019t smell old and dusty. Itu2019s perfect for my age group (27). It has enough light floral to be a perfect perfume for a day to night transition!  3) Finally, what I look for most in perfumes - it LASTS. This truly has been lasting all day on me which doesnu2019t happen to me very often. I can even still smell it lingering on sweaters I wore a day prior.   I highly recommend grabbing this or at least trying in store once itu2019s out! It easily entered my normal rotation."

However I feel like the magic really happens when this one sits on the skin over time. It becomes soft, a bit musky and the hints of vanilla really start to come out.

It is like an all grown up scent that I can't stop wearing. Similar to another popular sent, I think it smells different on everyone BUT I swear the scent changes throughout the day. I can put it on in the morning and still smell it the next day. It definitely has more of a floral/vanilla/musk to it that I love. I'm not a huge fan of the other popular scents and I think this one is for those looking for a more chic, mature, and rich scent. I keep telling everyone I smell like inside of a high-end brands store. LOVE it and highly recommend. Also the bottle is so chic and i loveeee that it is gold as a fellow gold girl!"

Upon application it smells kind of powdery but that dissipates quickly and I'm left with some of the floral notes. The true magic is when my skin warms up a bit and that's where the vanilla and musk start to shine through. It's absolutely not a vanilla gourmand tho, so if you were expecting that I would look for it elsewhere. It's a scent that lives close to the skin and feels very sensual.

It smells sweet, mature, and expensive, but not in a department-store kind of way. It makes me feel like a strong, yet soft and feminine woman.  I put a little bit on my wrists in the evening and it lasted until I washed it off before bed, so over 5 hours! I like that the smell doesn't change as you wear it throughout the day. If you've ever tried the Glossier you perfume, it almost reminds me of that but more mature, soft, and womanly. I prefer this Retrospect perfume over the Glossier one! I plan on wearing this every time I go out.  The bottle this perfume comes in is also one of my favorite parts about it. It's a very nice, smooth curved bottle that fits nicely in your hand, but has a flat bottom so you can put it on your vanity to be shown off. The gold accents are super pretty and the best materials. Doesn't feel cheap at all. This perfume is yet another product I've gotten from MERIT that shows their dedication to consistently super high-quality products that aren't just more junk in the market - but actually products you'll want to use and are 100% worth the money.  tl;dr - You really couldn't ask for a better date night perfume! Buy itttt, you won't regret it"

Anyways, this Restrospect Fragrance is very strong, very rich as Merit had described it. It is very floral, woodsy, and musky which is great for colder months. It isn't peppery or light for summer months, at least personally not to me. The scent lingers on even after shower which I love! I love scents that can last and linger on your body or clothes for throughout the day. I am entirely pleased with this perfume. It is quite strong so I will be more gentle with my sprays. If you are the type of person who can get migraines easily from perfumes, I wouldn't recommend this one but if you truly love strong warm rich perfume, this is the one for you!! Thank you Merit!

Itu2019s hard to describe a scent but itu2019s not overwhelming and you only need one spray. It lasts all day and the scent seems to change through the day also.

I've been on the hunt for a clean perfume for years- unfortunately most of the cleaner products don't smell or feel as luxurious as a traditional perfume- until now. The Retrospect perfume smells so elevated. It's subtle yet strong and I can see myself using it throughout all seasons of the year."

However, i sprayed it through out my body and wore for it for the entire day and the smell smoothed out through out the day and gave me like a clean flowery smell and lasted and even stayed on my clothes which i love. This scent will have smelling amazing throughout the entire day. I will recommend to friends and family."

My first impression was how beautiful the packaging and bottle are, the perfume looks so chic on display or in your bag. The bottle fits nicely in your hand, the only downside is I could see the cap being hard to remove for individuals with hand mobility limitations. In a market saturated with new perfumes & skin scents, Retrospect sets itself apart from the rest. When I took my first sniff, I couldn't place what I was smelling - it was fresh, but enveloped in a buttery, powdery, cozy blanket. I definitely smell the bergamot and pear notes first, quickly followed by the ambertte and aldehydes. The floral middle notes aren't your traditional florals - the orris note mellows them out with its powdery scent. On my skin, the moss and musk notes stay the most prominent throughout the day, sweetened a little with vanilla, while still having a fresh, zingy undertone from the bergamot. This is a clean skin scent, but cozy clean not fresh out of the shower clean. It is PERFECT for fall & winter, and will transition beautifully into the warmer seasons. From a fragrance girly through and through, I am truly impressed. Bravo Merit!!!"
