So even though it was more expensive than what I was using I decided to go ahead and get it. It is totally worth it to me. My skin feels so much softer and looks smoother.

Once empty, I can think of dozens of ways to repurpose such a gorgeous container, and I greatly appreciate the use of such sustainable packaging!

The ceramides and squalene really perform as intended, they sink into the skin without leaving it feeling tacky or shiny. If you find that it's not absorbing the way you would like it to, I definitely recommend using a gentle chemical exfoliant to remove any dead skin and with it obstacles to the cream reaching deeper. It's perfect for a fall to winter (and all winter long) transition to a heavier hitting formula that will defend against the dryness and effects of the colder season, the especially in climates with more extreme weather."

I have sensitive, sometimes dry skin, and this cream works wonders in calming redness and keeping my skin balanced. Within a week, I noticed a visible difference in my skin's texture and overall radiance, with fine lines appearing softer and my skin looking noticeably firmer. The fact that it's eczema-friendly makes me feel even more confident about using it daily.  The blend of biomimetic ceramides and lipids truly supports my skin barrier, helping retain moisture throughout the day. I've tried many face creams, but this one has quickly become my #1 choice for intense hydration and skin repair. Highly recommend it to anyone looking for a cream that lives up to its promises!"

It does not feel tacky, and makeup lays nicely over it. I definitely think my skin is much more hydrated, and bright. A little goes a long way! I use it all over my face and neck, and any extra I wipe on the tops of my hands.   The packaging is great.

The first thing I noticed was the cream's rich, luxurious texture. It's deeply hydrating without feeling heavy, and it absorbs well into the skin, leaving a soft, velvety finish.  What stands out the most about this cream is its formulau2014packed with squalane, omega fatty acids, and ceramides, which work together to nourish and repair the skin barrier. After using it consistently, my skin feels noticeably more hydrated, plump, and less prone to dryness and flakiness. It's also free of parabens, synthetic fragrances, and other potentially irritating ingredients, which is great for my sensitive skin.  This product has become a lifesaver during colder months when my skin is extra dry, but I think it would be suitable for anyone dealing with dehydration or seeking a more radiant, resilient complexion. While it is a bit on the pricier side, I find the results make it worth it, especially if you're looking for a gentle, effective solution to tackle dryness and strengthen your skin barrier."

This is excellent because you don't need as much. If you have dry skin or want bouncy firm skin I recommend this. I did receive it as a mini sample with my points. The sample is in a nice glass jar.

It smells like socks. It's very bad, but it dissipates within a minute. I keep using the cream becuse it works and it doesn't break me out. But the reviews aren't lying, you might get a stinky jar. I really really really hope they address that (because it does give you the ick after washing, cleansing, and prepping your face to smother sock cream on it lol it kinda ruins the self care vibe) but the formula is otherwise amazing."

This does not work well with oily nor combination cream - despite being careful with how much product I apply on after washing twice a day - it leaves my skin very greasy/oily. It's on the heavier side. I do love all the other ingredients in it, I use their eye cream without any issues. I will not be buying again.

Shady business. I wish they would just make this a dense cream and stop trying to make it hydrating and lighter it actually feels worse and dries out your skin and the inconsistency of the formula creates irritation. I get super itchy and red and the product pills. They should have kept the original consistency of a rich dense cream. A little product used to go a long way and it really helped with my dry sensitive skin. It seems like brands are reformulating and they are all starting to be the same consistency. Theres a purpose of having different types of products. They even have a gel version so im not sure why they think having goopey sticky gel would appeal to everyone..I also read on reddit a lot of people are buying the hand cream which is more moisturizing and only 15 bucks..seems like the brand doesnt know how to keep their audience or create a rich moisturizing cream anymore."

Yes its plumping but no moisture at all.. It used to be a rich cream that had some humectant properties now it melts into literally water. what they dont understand is too much gylcerine and hyaluronic acid and not enough emolliance causes ur skin to DRY OUT and pull water OUT! Because of this, you have to reapply and that is what irritated my skin. Dried it out and i ended up having to get hydrocortisone shots in my eye lid. if u have DRY skin do not get this.

It's been a few days and I still have a red raw rash across my cheeks. I don't usually have sensitive skin so I can only imagine what it would do. Definitely don't recommend."

I was skeptical, but I actually really like this repair cream for its super moisturizing ability (and isn't greasy!). The first time wearing it, I got compliments on my skin. In the reviews here people have noted the smell. They're not wrong -- there is an initial whiff that's unpleasant when you first apply. It smells like Maker's Mark bourbon whiskey, which I always thought smelled like feet. It could be the shea butter. The scent goes away fast, though. This product actually has ten main ingredients in common with Augustinus Bader's The Cream (also smells like Maker's Mark) and for that reason alone I know that this formula is a good one. Augustinus Bader products are the best there are, but $230 for 50mL of moisturizer isn't in reach for me. This is a good alternative. 4 stars because I probably will keep shopping around after I run out, but it think this is a great product for the price."

As far as performance, this stuff is AMAZING!!! I have really dry 40 year old skin and use retinols and acids (on opposite nights) and I need daily hydration, especially during dry Midwest winters,  but I hate the way deep moisture creams feel on my face. I can't stand that slimy suffocated feeling. Makes me cringe. I saw in a previous review that this cream worked for someone with sensory issues and they were right!

I've tried many moisturizers within the price range of biossance, and this one stands out for several reasons: you only need a small amount (helps justify cost), it's very moisturizing for my very dry skin, it leaves this smooth/shiny appearance that doesn't fade; it looks amazing under a tinted sunscreen, and sets in really well. I noticed people saying it smells like feet, fish, bad, etc. It is an algae product; I would say it has an oceanesque smell, but it fades right away. I personally don't mind it, and prefer it over fragrant smells. I got the smallest size as a points reward before purchasing the full size, so maybe wait for that if you aren't sure about the full size.   Don't buy this product if: you like mattefying products, this isn't for you - it has a shiny appearance. If you have oily skin - I have dry skin and love it; not sure how it would work for oily skin because it does have an oil-shine to it. If you really dislike ocean smells."

I can say this truly repaired my skin within a couple of days. Ive been using it now for two weeks and it layers well with all of my other serumes and my mineral sunscreen. Oh and it lauers well woth makeup   I am still feeling it out I think it might be too strong for my eyelids but it is still an amazing product. People say I look like I am glowing.

It's gentle and doesn't cause any breakouts or irritation, which is especially important for my girlfriend's sensitive skin. The only downside is the scent, which I find a bit too strong.

Yes, it smells like an aged soft cheese however, the smell dissipates quickly. I cannot smell it once I have blended the moisturizer completely into my skin. Initially I was very very nervous, my skin ATE this up. For about a week it seemed like my skin was a just sucking it up and I was watching a very quick demise of a very expensive product. I was not happy, but after several days my skin sort of balanced and I had to use a bit less. It was an interesting development; the temperature here has been consistently cold with no humidity to speak of, so I know my skin is the affecting variable.  I don't know yet if it is worth the money, but it plays nice with my expensive layering products and my skin seems to like it. While it is not as occlusive as I like for my night moisturizer, I will continue to use it for a good makeup base; it leaves my skin just slightly tacky enough to make my tinted moisturizer glide over the top perfectly."

I find it is usually too heavy for summer, but as I live in the pacific northwest it works great as a night time moisturizer the rest of the year. I also use it during the day in winter if I am especially dry, however I only do so on no make up days as it doesn't work the best under make up imo. This is totally a night cream though despite it not specifying so, so I honestly don't expect it to look great under make up.   I find it works best if you have some kind of water based serum underneath that you let dry first, as the thick formula of the moisturizer helps lock in the hydration. It does a good job on it's own don't get me wrong, but if you pair it with a nice serum the combo effect is even better.   Absolutely love that there is a value size now. I share my skin care with my partner and the value size lasted us almost all winter."

I don't know if it'll work so well in the summer months, it may be too heavy, but for winter it's a-m-a-z-i-n-g! It somehow feels perfectly light, rich, and nourishing at the same time. A little goes a long way. My skin is just so plump and balanced after using this! It doesn't leave me looking or feeling greasy or shiny at all. It actually almost makes my skin look matte, but without any of the dullness or dryness.  I don't remember now if there was any fragrance in the ingredients list, but I don't notice a scent one way or the other. I am very used to fragrance-free products though/prefer that, so if you're used to sweet-smelling skincare, you may not like it. I haven't experience any irritation or breakouts from this at all."

I went through probably 10 different moisturizers;  some that are just popular online, and some known to be effective for helping the concerns that I had.  This was the only one that checked all my boxes.  It helped my redness, calmed the dryness, and even aided in clearing up my acne (along with salicylic acid).   As mentioned in nearly every review, no, it doesn't smell great.  It isn't heavily fragranced like many popular moisturizers are, and one of the things in it likely produces the odd smell.  For some, this is an automatic deal breaker.  If you're like me though, sensitive to fragrance and don't mind the odd smell (which is only present during application), this is a great moisturizer."

Sure, it might provide some protection by creating a barrier from the elements, but it doesn't help replenish moisture. If you try to put sunscreen or foundation over top of it they'll pick up the moisturizer and you end up with little pilled up balls of sunscreen/foundation mixed with the moisturizer that you have to wipe off meaning if you want to wear sunscreen or makeup you end up having to take off the moisturizer you just put on.

After a full day of use, my skin was way more soft, not flaking anymore, and no breakout to be found. I've been using it for a few weeks now and it has become my favorite moisturizer so far. I pair it with Tatcha's u2018Dewy Skin Cream' and they work beautifully together to keep my skin balanced and refreshed. It's very light feeling and doesn't really have a smell for those of you who don't like fragrances. The price is a little steep, but well worth it for the amount of product you get and the effect it has. Highly recommend"

I read on the Biossance website that they suggest adding some of their Vitamin C Rose Oil into it but it didn't help at all.  It does dissipate some, but I swear I get whiffs of it throughout the day? I am traumatized by it I think. I unfortunately must move on.  There are other really good creams out there.  Hopefully Biossance will make a scented and unscented version of this cream.  There is something else I think it kinda smells like but they will not post my review if I say it.

So, I thought why not get a sample to experience the glory of these cream.  Very mild smell, and doesn't really have a very creamy texture at all, it oddly felt like putting on a dry cream. It certainly also felt like that on the face as well. While I will say it felt the same all day/ all night, it just doesn't have that nice ultra soft silky plumping texture or feeling that I want creams to give me - especially a repair cream. I'm not looking for greasy, tired of the whole slugging trend, you will never catch me putting petroleum on my face. But it just didn;t make my skin feel like it was being revitalized through the entire time I used it. I was comparing it to a Paula's choice Antioxidant Enriched Natural Moisturizer and First Aid Beauty Intensive Repair Cream, and both of them left me feeling so well moisturized and after all day or waking up after sleeping with either of these creams on, I had that same softness and plumped feeling. I just never found it with this cream, it feels lifeless. I even have a $10 moisturizer (from Korea) and that does the trick immensely better than this cream. Seeing how expensive this brand is and how much people sing praise about it all the time, I was severely disappointed and don't intend to test out anything else buy them. I would not throw it out but I am certainly not even going to choose it over the numerous good and much cheaper repair cream options that are already out there doing it better."

Honestly, it's great to have on hand to pamper your face! The scent is very light, almost like a weak tea, though if you are more  sensitive to scents, you may find it more harsh.

The texture is very smooth and the consistency is quite think, so a little can go a long way. The only reason I did not give this product 5 stars was because of the scent.

After just a month my skin is so much softer.

I will absolutely keep using this."

I really like that it doesn't have a overly fragrance in the product . I think sometimes it takes away from its benefits ( just my opinion) . My skin is sensitive and it didn't cause any allergic reaction . It really moisturized the skin which I enjoy applying it mostly at night and sometimes during the day if I used an acid or a retinol the night before . It is a cross of drunk elephant and Kate Somerville moisturizer . I do wish that the one I got had a spatula to get it out of the jar . Still I'm being picky about it and it is still a great product . Loved it so much that I got a back up  . Seriously recommend for anyone who is serious about there skin care and that is allergic to fragrance like me .   This product was send for free by influencer to give my full honest review ."

The one and only problem is the fragrance when I first am spreading it on. It has a hoppy/wheat smell which isn't terrible but it also isn't pleasant. That is the reason for taking off 1 star.

You get a good amount of product because it's thick you don't really need to pack on a lot. I only use it at night to deep into my skin for better hydration.

It does fill the fine lines but when you don't apply the cream, its visible again. My sunspots are still visible and haven't lightened yet but I only used it for about 2 weeks. The texture of my skin does look smoother for my acne scars on my cheeks but the crater acne scars and large pores are still visible and I haven't seen it heal those area yet.

It's a thick cream and does seem quite hydrating when it's on but honestly I'm just not seeing the amazing results that other reviewers are. My bare skin still feels very rough. My pores are huge on my forehead and I'm breaking out a lot, which I don't necessarily think is due to this cream, but I'm breaking out beyond the usual places and they take forever to go away/heal if they even do. I think this just isn't the cream for me. I also hate the smell of it. I like that it's packaged in a glass jar, but that does make it quite heavy if you're carrying it with you. I might just set this aside to use only at night or in the fall. But I am unlikely to purchase this product."

This moisturizing face repair cream is formulated with lipids that mimic and support skin's natural moisture barrier which include squalane, omega fatty acids, ceramides and plant sterols which help nourish, plump, hydrate and feed your skin. I have combination skin and this worked great as my nighttime moisturizer, as I like to apply more of a rich cream at night. It leaves my skin super hydrated and plump the next morning. What I really like is that there isn't any synthetic fragrance or essential oils that are added, so it is completely fragrance free, but the ingredients themselves do emit a mild scent that should dissipate a minute or two after application. Sometimes my skin can tend to be a little sensitive and I didn't have any issues with this. I'm loving the Biossance line so far and will definitely be trying out more of their products in the future."

For me, I think this is more of a seasonal product for when I go through bouts of dry skin during the winter. I don't think it's an every day, year round moisturizer."

Also I have a sensitive skin that I developed after giving birth so I am really careful of what I  putting on my skin. This is great and I don't think I can live without it. It also doesn't have fragrance so it's a plus. I love it and recommend it to everyone to give it a try please!"

This is a really rich face cream that was made for dry skin like mine.  It has a thick creamy texture that takes a bit to absorb.  Although it's fragrance free, there's a weird scent from the natural ingredients, but that does dissipate after applying.  My skin felt very hydrated, and after a few weeks I noticed diminished fine lines.  However, for me this moisturizer is too heavy for the summer months, and I would most likely use it during the drier winter months when my skin really needs it."

I also experienced a few breakouts when first starting this moisturizer they have calmed a lot now so I think it's was just my skin getting use to it but I know where it's so thick it can clog pores rather quickly so please don't use alot just a thin layer. Overall it is a good moisturizer but it's one of those ones that you have to be careful with if you have acne prone skin. This was gave to me for my honest opinion on."

Now, I've got to say that I've never come across a Biossance product I didn't adore before; truly, they usually work very well for me! So, I'm really sorry to say that I had some degree of difficulty even using this product. Outwardly, it looks promising: nice packaging, definitely a u201ccreamy-cream,u201d and it's from Biossance. That alone would likely get me to buy it if I were out at Sephora and in the market for a new cream. But if I did, I'd be disappointed. For me, I couldn't get past the smell. Now, it's advertised as unscented but I got a strong, almost-nostalgic smell of chlorine-mold-mildew-y pool deck at the local Water Park, and I think we all know what the kiddos do in the public pool at their discretion. I don't know if it's the squalane or what, but the smell is so off-putting it's borderline offensive to the olfactory receptors. A hard (yet sorrowful) pass for me; maybe it's a wonder cream and will work for others who can get past the smell.  2 out of 5 stars for being non-comedogenic and vegan.  #complimentary #SpringPicksVoxBox #biossance #texturelove #MoroccanoilBody @Influenster @biossance @mizani @moroccanoil"

Love the fact that the box is made out of sugarcane which is very innovative and great for the environment.

It gives my skin enough moisture where my skin feels hydrated, but not overly greasy where it feels like oil is sitting on my skin. It absorbs fairly quickly when you rub into the skin, but does leave a slight film. I think this is great for normal skin. It has a really rich texture almost like a hybrid between a balm and moisturizer. Jars are not my favorite since you have to dip in and sanitary reasons, but I think it is the right component as it might be too thick for a pump. Overall I love this moisturizer, but think if you have dry skin you might not like the satin finish and want a dewier one"

Did not irritate my super sensitive skin! After the first application my skin felt hydrated and plump.  It's a nice thick texture like the other facial moisturizers is used (dream mask by youth to the people, and honey halo by farmacy) it's great for use at night and during the day! The product is phenomenal, it also layers very well with your other products in your skincare routine! I hate products that pill or become a funky texture when layering- this did not! I love the natural scent it has as well! Scented skincare is so overrated and irritating to my skin.  I have used half the jar now and I am soo happy! The packaging is 1st class as well, the glass jar, the labeling the box it comes it is all top notch. I do wish it came with a spatula for no contamination, but I am using one I already had!"

My only reason for one less star is the price is pretty high for the amount you get, so I'm not sure I'd purchase in the future. The smell is also not great as others have mentioned. I don't like scented products anyway, and I use a skinceuticals serum that smells like hot dogs, but I love that one so much/it's so good for my skin that I can look past the smell.

It really changes the texture of your skin, in a good way. It doesn't irritate my skin or make it oily. It's the consistency of a balm so when it warms up to your skin, it soaks it right up and gives you natural finish! I love the fact that it has no fragrance especially since it's going on the face.

I think it has helped my overall texture and fine lines so far and I can't wait to see over even more time. There is alot of product and you don't need much so it's definitely worth the money.

I my opinion this is what a lot of fragrance-free beauty products smell like.   I really like this cream layered with a nice argan oil.  It contains a small amount of hyaluronic acid, which is great for hydration.  It's a great barrier repair cream if used consistently. It made my skin feel supple and soft.   I really enjoyed this, and I will strongly consider purchasing once I run lit."

Pros: great ingredients, great packaging, super hydrating  Cons: overpriced, off-putting scent (which does fade after you apply), thick/heavy/greasy  I've been a fan of Biossance 100% Squalane since pre-launch (I was a product tester). I've been purchasing and using that oil since it was available. I haven't been a fan of their other products, mostly because they contain fragrances or other ingredients which can be very irritating to sensitive skin. I was so happy to see a fragrance free option geared toward dry and sensitive skin.  My first thought when I opened the box was how small the container was for this price-especially since it's a glass container. My next concern was the weird and unpleasant smell of the cream. It smells like an ingredient has gone bad. I did some research to see if this was a common concern and it definitely is. I think clean beauty has gone a bit too far with fear mongering about the dangers of parabens. I encourage you to do your own research. This really smells like the olive oil has gone bad. Shea butter is not the best smelling either but I've used lots of fragrance free products and never experienced this type of scent. For a company that started so scientifically and that is priced as is, I expected better.  The texture is heavy and while it did absorb somewhatu2026it left an overly heavy/greasy layer on my skin. It felt really similar to using a product with dimethicone (which it doesn't contain). This is far too heavy for day use in my opinion, especially in the warmer months. I patched tested several times on my arm, leg, and hands before trying this on my face;  the odor and heaviness made me concerned about a reaction. I didn't experience any irritation but I didn't like the feel on my face. I really prefer a cream that fully absorbs. Try a sample first!"

My husband borrowed some the other day & now he is also using it daily. He agrees that it works great. I would have given it 5 stars but I did find one thing I disliked. It is not the most pleasant smell & when you apply it you can smell it on your face for a few seconds. Thank God it goes away because it's not good at all. Hopefully they can figure that out."

This is especially amazing to use at night as a night cream, but if you don't have oily skin it's also great for morning as well. A little goes a long way.

For its richness, it is uniquely lightweight. I truly enjoyed how it feels on my face. I think it's great for being worn under the makeup with a primer. The smell was somewhat off-putting, it has the earthy notes of umami, but I was not bothered as it evaporated quickly.

Honestly this is one of the worst smelling creams I've ever put on my face it smells exactly like stinky old socks. They didn't add any fragrance but maybe they should have. Doesn't seem to absorb into my skin very well either and doesn't seem to moisturize very well as it claims. I was really looking forward to this considering the price point. But was very let down mainly because of the scent. The glass jar is gorgeous. Other than that I don't have many good things to say."

Biossance has been recommended regularly during my research on products.  Biossance Squalane + Omega Repair Cream has important omega fatty acids that fortify, restore and plump the skin. In addition to skin identifying ingredients that are found naturally in our skin dermis. This moisturizer has a whipped texture that glides on very easily. This will be good for all skin types; especially oily. No heavy residue feeling on my skin after using, and it didn't irritate or break me out. Unfortunately; I suffer from hormonal breakouts but this actually calmed my skin down and imitated the healing process. Definitely recommend 100%"

If you're sensitive to u201cearthyu201d scents, this may not be for you.  As mentioned, this is a thicker cream. It may be suitable for the winter, but this would be too thick for me during spring/summer. Maybe if you have very dry skin, this would be great, but for me, I would only use this as part of a night routine.  I tested it out twice as part of my morning and evening, and while I didn't look oily, it felt like that after some time.  I think this is better as part of a night routine, but it wouldn't replace my daily, personally."

It is also very effective, I noticed a difference right in the following morning, after having applied it before going to bed and slept.

Squalene and Omega, both absolutely plant-based, organic, cruelty free, and works wonders on hydration and moisturizing. u2728 Pretty sure safe for all skin types, but best for normal and dry skin u2728 Best for all ages, especially 25 and up. u2728 Super duper soft and glides literally like homemade butter. It genuinely felt like butter that my mom makes. u2728 Has no particular fragrance, but felt weird in the first sniff( just like homemade butter). But it vanishes in seconds. u2728 Kept me soft, hydrated and moisturized throughout the night and day.  u2728 Doesn't make you feel greasy u2728Perfect base for makeup or no makeup u2728 Worked well with all other products in my 7-step skincare routine. u2728 Absolutely safe for  sensitive skin u2728 A little goes a long way ( pea sized each time) u2728 Pricey, yes, but Absolutely worth it!!!  This definitely made my skin much much softer like baby's skin, glowing from within , smooth, bright and hydrated."

I am not particularly sensitive to bad smells. I am a nurse. Does this product smell bad, as a few other reviewers have noted? This product does have an odd, stale smell. I would not call it foul. But when your apply it into your skin, the smell goes away like magic. And let's not forget why there is an odor: THIS IS A CLEAN BEAUTY PRODUCT AND THEREFORE IT HAS NO FRAGRANCES OR PERFUMES. The smell you're smelling is the special ingredient that is good for your skin: SQUALANE.   Do I think this product is worth using? Absolutely. Is the smell so bad it would deter me from purchasing it? Not in the least. I will continue to use this product. It makes my skin look amazing and I have been getting compliments. Give it a try. There is a small sampler size available."

I have been using for about 3 weeks, and it is winter, so I will wait to see if I see any major differences or if the season change affects my opinion. Right now, I would recommend to anyone with severe dryness or as a good cold weather protectant."

Most big brands even if they claim to be oil free or noncomedogenic still make my face unhappy.  Not the case with this moisturizer. I put it on under my mineral sunscreen.  People are speaking of an odor. Well I looked at some of the pics of the consistory of the cream. I think the company might have fixed the odor because I smell absolutely no odor and the consistency of my cream looks more firm. Also the odor could have been from the squalene. I think that is what makes this Moisturizer so great though!"

That was during the beginning of winter. - Recently, my skin had been going toward a more dry skin type with the colder weather, and so this cream actually didn't create that oily film!

I've been using a really expensive murad moisturizer for the past two years, and haven't seen a huge improvement. I picked this up in a Holiday Kit to mix it up. It has changed my skin for the better in just a few uses.  The texture has improved because my skin is SO much more hydrated and plumped. I actually picked up another from being so excited. I have had a couple of pimples, and my skin can feel a little oily in the morning, which is not normal for me, but it is overall so much better, and its still new so hopefully will even out a bit more.   I'm overall super happy and looking forward to using this moving forward!"

One of the first ingredients is u201ccaprylic/capric triglycerideu201d, which is made from combining coconut oil with glycerin. I love using pure cold pressed extra virgin coconut oil to remove my makeup, but when it's on my skin for longer periods of time, such as in a moisturizer, it clogs my pores and breaks me out.  If you have acne, or are prone to breakouts, I would not recommend this. Every time I use it I wake up with bumps, clogged pores and white heads. Doesn't matter what serum I use underneath. I only use this cream on my neck now.  Some people may not have issues with coconut oil in moisturizers, but I wanted to put a warning out there for anyone with skin like mine. It's not a cheap cream so I hope I saved at least one persons skin with this review. Love other products from Biossance but this one is a big no-no."

It comes from a plant derived squalane. It's a clean beauty product so no harmful ingredients included. I love this face cream and believe it could not have come at a better time with winter emerging from the shadows and I live in Ohio so we tend to have many cold days and evenings. This will help to keep my skin happy and moisturized throughout the season and keep me happy not having dry cracked skin. I would definitely recommend and would buy again."

On the nights that I use this, I wake up in the morning looking glowy and my face is so soft. This cream doesn't have the best smell, it's a little funky I will say, but it doesn't linger too long once applied. Since I only use this at night the scent is not a big deal and not a dealbreaker for me. I will be using this throughout the winter months when my skin tends to get dry patches from the cold.

I've tried so many different moisturizers in the past but I don't think I ever remember getting results this good. Also I'm not sensitive to smells & didn't notice an odor as much as other reviews I read.

            "review_text": "So far I really like this. I have combination dry skin- oily at my temples and along my jawline with super dry skin in my t-zone. I was using a different night cream, but I live in a place with constantly changing weather that has wreaked havoc on my skin.   I started peeling and got very dry and extremely itchy. I bought this on the recommendation from an in store employee and it offered immediate relief. I've used it for a few days and while a minimal amount of peel is left on my skin, my face feels much more hydrated and quite soft. Yes, there is a little bit of a smell that I really don't like. However, the cream doesn't have much of an odor just sitting in the jar unless you hold it right up to your nose and it goes away within a second or two once it's rubbed in to your skin.   It is ultra rich though, so be prepared when you apply it. For me personally, this is definitely not a cream I would want to apply in the morning under makeup. It's way too heavy. But as a night time treatment, it's really, really good. A little goes a long way with this one. Take the advice from other reviewers and start with a small amount and add more later. Because I haven't used this for long enough, I don't know what it really will do for fine lines and wrinkles, but the significant boost in hydration is definitely enough to warrant five stars, even with the odd smell."

I will say I'm really impressed, I really like the formula and how it warms and then melts in to the skin.    It appears thick in the jar but once you warm some between  your fingers it glides right onto your skin.  I started with LESS than a pea size amount, warmed between my index fingers and dotted it on to my face.  My suggestion depending on your skin type is to start with less and add more.    I see people have commented about the scent.  I'm recovering from covid and cannot smell anything so to me it's unscented."

My cream doesn't smell at all and I haven't had any breakouts with it other then the breakouts I had before using this cream (hormonal Imbalance). My skin feels moisturized from morning and even till night to the point where I don't have to reapply! AMAZING moisturizer and such a life saver! A little also goes a long way, I apply a thin layer."

I threw caution to the wind and I shouldn't have. Lol. My skin is crazy sensitive and I think I wrecked the barrier with those products. One use of this cream has my skin feeling relieved. No more dry, burning sensation and the flushed reaction has calmed down. I don't think it smells much at all and what I do smell is not offensive like others are stating. Maybe something changed? I'm only saying this because the other reviews about smell almost made me not purchase. My experience is it's very neutral smelling without actually smelling much at all. Smells like non-fragranced,  earthy cream which is what my skin needs."

I also love that there is no fragrance in this moisturizer, since fragrance is unnecessary and is often an irritant. Although the smell of this moisturizer is unpleasant (it reminds me of manure or a farm?), the scent is not long-lasting and can be easily overlooked given the effectiveness of the product. I have tried SO many different moisturizers and this is the ONLY one that keeps my skin moisturized without inducing breakouts. It also saved my skin when I accidentally over-exfoliated (e.g., retinol/glycolic acid burns). My only issue with the product is that it can be tricky to apply given its thickness and sometimes the jars are not filled enough. But despite these minor inconveniences, I will continue to buy the product on a regular basis, at least until something better comes along."

The old formulation of The Ordinary's Natural Moisturizing Factors+HA left a very similar film.  I thought it was okay- it didn't break me out or cause irritation, it didn't leave my skin greasy or too under-moisturized, but it also didn't make my skin look or feel amazing and smelled like wet socks, and Sephora sells a couple of other moisturizers in the price range that I really enjoy, so this is one I'd definitely pass on."

However, when I finished the jar, I tested the volume capacity of the jar by filling it with 50 mL water. The water came nearly to the brim.  I sent a complaint to Biossance and they brushed me off, saying that sometimes air pockets form and if I tapped the jar gently the product would level out, but because of the volume of the air pocket there was no way the product would have leveled out even to the bottom of the neck, where the thread begins.  This cream is very nice and I have no complaints in that regard, but because the company dismissed my complaint so easily I just won't be buying this again."

If you're used to heavily fragrances products or extremely neutral moisturizers that don't have any oils like Squalane in them then yes, this will smell different.   I'd describe the scent as an intense unscented lotion  there are earthy notes but it honestly just smells like squalane and it's not noticeable at all once you start rubbing it in. I'm highly sensitive to fragrance in products and lingering odors so ai was cautious after reading the reviews but was removed to discover that it works great for me.   PROS:  - thick cream that glides onto skin and absorbs easily - super hydrating and makes my skin look plump and healthy - high-quality glass packaging that can be repurposed  CONS: - packaging. The jar is nice, but I wish this came in a tube or a jar that had a fully open top so it's easier to get out all of the product - for some the smell may be a deal breaker, even if it's brief - no makeup scoop included. For this price the least they could do is include a little plastic scoop to use with the jar.   If you're concerned about the smell, go to a local sephora and open the jar. Try not immediately react, give it a few tries to see if you really dislike it or if it's just unusual. Try it in person for a few days and see if you can live with it as the benefits it provides are just too good to let something small turn you away."

I went back and checked and there is a slight smell, but it's so very light, dissipates almost immediately and it's not a bad smell! Honestly, I've been through a few jars of this by now and never would have even noticed a smell if I hadn't read the reviews here.This is what a lot of fragrance-free beauty products smell like.   But performance-wise....I have very dry, sensitive skin and I really like this cream, especially mixed with or layered with a nice oil (the Biossance Squalane or Rose Vit C oil, or Stratia's Fortify oil or Drunk Elephant's or the Ordinary's marula oils are all great.) Or any nice squalane, marula, maracuja, argan, rosehip or jojoba oil would work, too. Also, just use a tiny bit of the oil if you try this method!  Almost removed one star because occasionally this cream can make my skin sting very slightly for a few seconds. Not sure what's in it that does that. It could be because my skin is just that sensitive, or it might be because it contains a small amount of hyaluronic acid (which sometimes makes my skin sting a bit). Only lasts for a few seconds, and the oils buffer it if you use them. And this cream really does seem to heal and hydrate my dry and sensitive skin. It's a great barrier repair cream if used consistently. I'm not inspired to write many reviews, but this cream inspired me. Highly recommended!"

It is so moisturizing, but doesn't cause my acne-prone skin to breakout and leaves it so soft and supple. A little bit goes a long way. As for the scent, this product is fragrance free and to me, it just smells like any other fragrance-free product. After application, the smell is not noticeable."

Also, as for the smell that other reviewers have mentioned: this product is fragrance free, and to me, the scent of the product is fairly neutral and not at all bothersome.

Not to say that any of the ones I've listed are bad - it's just that this moisturizer works wonders for me! It's definitely a thicker cream but it spreads beautifully and works under sunscreen (though I'm not sure how it would be under makeup). I personally haven't noticed any scent, but I certainly have noticed that my skin isn't dry when I wake up anymore! It is a bit pricy and I'm sure you could find comparable moisturizers at a lower price (like Cerave + squalane), so I'd recommend trying out a sample before going all in. That said, I'll certainly be repurchasing this when I run out!"

When you melt it in between you fingers and initially put it on it smells like the jalapeno cheddar chips from old dutch LOL the smell goes away  after ~3 seconds but while you massage it in the smell is definitely that! and then goes away.

I've decided to use this on my hands and it has become one of my favorite hand creams! My hands are smooth and soft in the morning after applying at night before bed. I'm giving 2 stars because I wasn't expecting a negative reaction on my face, but the rash goes away as soon as I stop using it so it can't be that bad.

Amazing ingredients no fragrance (I don't get why some are complaining about the smell it's not bad at all, just smells like a normal non scented smell). Fragrance can't irritated your skin over time anyway. It goes on so smooth, it absorbs well and leaves skin glowing without being greasy. It's hard to find a moisturizing that actually moisturizes your skin and I say this because this product is the only one that's ever helped within top 2-3 days after using tretinoin and getting flaky skin. Now I just use this and then tretinoin on top as my skin can't take retinol without drying out."

I was worried when I used this because I have very acne prone skin and my skin breaks out often when I try new moisturizers but I've used this over 2 weeks and I have no new acne! So is say if you're nervous about using a thicker cream I'd say this one is a safe one for us acne babes! I was nervous because of the u201cShea butteru201d ingredient but just trust me this is the good good. Also it will probably last you your entire mortal life you need so little. So the price actually is justified for me. If you're on the fence this is me telling you through the screen this is the beat moisturizer I've ever used and a good moisturizer makes a big difference to your moisturizer skin barrier.

I've tried lots of products both in the drug store and high end but this moisturiser is really what does it for me especially because I use potent actives. A little also goes a long way so the price isn't too bad when that's factored in. Will definitely be repurchasing"

I've only used this in the winter so far but I think it'll be my all year nightly moisturizer. I was going through an especially hard time with my skin when I started this. I had upped my retinol a bit causing dryness and wearing face masks has been causing extra chin and jaw breakouts. I started using this at night as my last step in my skin care routine and it has totally healed and hydrated my skin after just a few days. My skin feels smoother, more hydrated, plumper and my breakouts are disappearing (not for this but from finding a moisturizer that works with my acne medication). I'm so happy I finally tried this! I noticed the very very faintest smell when first applying but people in the reviews are being extremely DRAMATIC about the scent. I'm really sensitive to scents and this has almost no scent to it. There is the faintest lightest scent that is from the actual active ingredients of the product that are helping your skin. The thing is Biossance didn't add any harsh fragrances or chemicals that are terrible for your skin to try to entice you into trying the product...we should all prefer this to smelling like vanilla while damaging our skin. Thank you Biossance for always using safe, effective, cruelty free and sustainable ingredients only!"

This product has no fragrance which is amazing for the skin and it doesn't smell bad, in fact it barely has a scent at all.... nor does the scent linger after the product is absorbed. I've had literally no irritation at all despite having dry, acne prone and sometimes sensitive skin. I have seen wonderful results with steady use over the past 6 weeks with twice daily use. My skin feels and stays more hydrated throughout the day which is a huge game changer for anyone going through harsh and dry winters. Although this doesn't have an advertised u201cplumpingu201d affect, I am still noticing overall more plump skin, and it may be that it is just hydrating me SO effectively. Lastly, it absorbs quickly and layers easily, so you don't have to worry about putting sunscreen or anything else on top. If you need a scent, just layer their vitamin C and rose oil right overtop of it, they combine quite nicely and make my skin so so soft because they also both have squalene. I just HAD to write a good review because it's ludicrous that the overall rating has been dragged down over a smell..... this is a moisturizer not a perfume!"

I'm still looking for a vegan and CF replacement for my CeraVe, and this was one of the products on my list to try, but I decided against it due to the price tag. So when Sephora offered it as a redeemable, I was pretty excited to try it! Unfortunately, I'm not impressed. I have a bunch of skin issues that impair barrier function and a fragrance allergy, so the smell is a non-issue for me. The ingredients are nice, but the product itself wasn't all that moisturizing - certainly not better than my $14 drugstore moisturizer. I also found it super greasy, probably because of squalane being the second ingredient, and even after several hours, it had not soaked into my skin. I ended up wiping it off because I couldn't stand it anymore. I have normal-dry skin, so if it's too greasy for dry skin then I'm not sure who it's for. My skin conditions are under control thanks to my current routine, so maybe it's nicer for repair instead of as a maintenance product but it just didn't do it for me. Three stars feels generous, honestly, but the ingredients are good, it's vegan and CF, and the packaging is gorgeous so it gets points for those. It's just not a great formula and it's incredibly overpriced for what it is, there are nicer moisturizers that cost significantly less per oz. If your skin can't get enough oils, you might like it better but I still think you could get the same effect and save money with a different product."

My combo skin is very happy. :) Also, it's like silk under makeup. So far no breakouts using it, and I'll come back to update on more long-term benefits.  As for the smell, you guys had me almost not buy the stuff, thinking it would smell like feet from across the room! It is absolutely not an issue. You have to really stick your nose in the jar to smell it, and even then it's just a little play-doughy. This is just what un-scented cosmetics smell like - the ingredients that are in them, without being masked by horrible perfumes.   Definitely recommend, even if I do find the price a little high."

Another star is knocked-off for the scent: since there are no added fragrance, the base cream smells like sour-urine from the pot, and when smoothed over warm skin, turns into the smell of stale wheat-cereal...  For the price tag, look for other alternatives that you might enjoy more UNLESS you are one of the ultra-sensitive-skin-type that can't have any added fragrance in your cream."

After using the Biossance cream, my skin looks hydrated and plump without any redness or signs of irritation. This cream doesn't feel as thick/balmy as the Creme Ancienne, which I would apply at night and still feel on my skin in the morning. I do think the Creme Ancienne was more hydrating, but this one is hydrating enough for cold/dry winters. It sinks into the skin quickly and I don't feel like I have anything on my face. Unlike Creme Ancienne, I can use it day and night. Love it!"

This stuff broke me out into itchy red bumps that turned into deep and painful whiteheads in some places and blackheads in other places. The packaging says that it is non-comedogenic and many reviews say that it did not clog pores, so I'm guessing this is an allergic reaction rather than a pore clogging ingredient.

It diminishes fine lines and heals pimples very quickly. I use it in conjunction with their vitamin c rose oil and my skin has never been happier. Also, for the people who are saying this moisturizer is too heavy, that is because you are using too much. I have Normal skin, I only put one finger in the jar and I use the one dot for my whole face. If you're putting 4-5 dots of the moisturizer on your face you are using way more than enough. Only one dot and it should cover your whole face. This moisturizer works best in the winter time and especially before going to sleep. You will wake up glowing."

Actually, the smell is almost comforting knowing that I'm putting ingredients on my skin that had/bring life and that it isn't perfumed and drying!"

I mean, everything from CeraVe to Drunk Elephant. However, this moisturizer does not. It definitely gives my skin extra moisture when it needs it most and does not burn. Impressive. (3)  I didn't notice any smell whatsoever. I noticed some reviewers saying it smelled really bad - I think they should return their product bc it likely has spoiled somehow. I don't think my product has any particular scent to it. (4) It does take some time to sink in. (Tho admittedly I put on A LOT of the cream - you could always use less). You may like this - it gives your face a glow. If not, then you can use it as a nighttime moisturizer. Personally, I don't have any issues applying it before I apply my makeup in the morning. (5) The ingredient list is so amazing. I can actually recognize most of the ingredients. This cream contains lots of quality ingredients for your skin.  BOTTOM-LINE - Deep moisturizer for ultra-dry or sensitive skin. Quality ingredients. No discernible smell."

I even put my nose to the container and while there is a slight scent, it is very subtle and completely indiscernible when you apply it to your face.

The moment I opened the box, the smell of the cream hit me like a ton of bricks. I thought it was something else from outside since my washroom window was open but I smeared a pea amount on my chin and almost threw up. The smell also lingers all day so I found it so hard to concentrate. Having to wear a mask all day long with the smell of this cream stuck in there is terrible. I'd definitely go in-store and try a small dab of a sample of the back of your hand before commiting. I bought it online and sadly had to return it because I can't bear the smell. I'm so sad because it's such an amazing formula - for dry, combination, even oily skin, this cream would work wonders especially in the harshness of Canadian winters."

Definitely took some a few uses for my skin to purge. Light bumps but was back to normal after a week. It's good as a daily moisturizer. What impressed me was their ingredients. I looked up every single one, and they're all beneficial for the skin! With the exception of the last few but I know other moisturizers that have even scarier ingredients. Not mind blowing but moisturizing and worth a try."

Started w/ the squalane gel & it's been my favorite moisturizer ever since..it helped clear & balance my skin after going through a year of a horrible break out. Lately I've been really wanting to try their other skin care products & bought the limited edition sampler box ... my goodness, fell madly in love with the squalane omega repair cream! completely exceeded my expectations! It's like putting face butter on my face, so smooth, glides on so easily & absorbs fast & perfectly... & leaves the skin instantly hydrated & looking healthier & with that subtle u2018plumped' effect, it just feels like u just fed the skin all the nutrients it needed! I personally love it! I think it's powerful enough u can use it once a day, that's all I need for my skin. I would say use the gel for when your skin doesn't need extra hydration and use the cream for when it's extra dry it needs a little boost or overnight... love this product, high-quality & effective. No break outs yet either, was worried about that b/c leaves moist dewey effect on skin & just feels like so much hydration. The other one I've tried so far that I loved too is the eye cream, I'll do a separate review but that one is definitely super hydrating to the eye area too. Thank u Biossance! Ps. u2018The smell' of the cream does not bother me at all, it's neutral & barely anything at all in my opinion. I appreciate that about Biossance too, it is mostly odorless without those added strong artificial scents I've had w/ other brands. The cream is subtle effective & pleasant to me, 5 stars:)"

Maybe someone with a less sensitive nose can handle it, but I have to hold my breath while applying it. It smells like something sour and animal fat.

I got the mini/sample version as my sephora birthday gift last year and use it as a night cream and firstly, with this stuff a little bit goes a loooooong way. In the approximate year I have had it, I've only just recently ran out, and the sampler is only 5ml. I have oily/combo skin, with very prominent acne scarring/dark spots from hormonal acne I got after high school (I am twenty-three.) so as you can imagine I've tried alot of different products/methods. I started layering this on top of a rosehip oil before I go to bed and it really has helped me skin immensely, just by preventing new breakouts and really helping my mosture barrier. My skins feels cleaner, smoother, my skin tone looks more even, and less dull. It is a thicker cream so if you lean oily you're not gonna have a good time using this in your morning routine, but putting this on as your last step before you go to sleep you're going to wake up feeling so plump, hydrated, and bouncy. The ONLY complaints I have are the smell at first is a little funky. It doesn't linger for long at all and it's not overpowering but at first I was concerned it went bad, until I found out that's just the smell. Secondly, the price definitely makes me cringe, but maybe that's just me. I WILL be purchasing the full size, but you better believe I'm not gonna tell people I dropped 60 dollars for it."

Its definitely combated the dryness without causing any breakouts, however, besides that i haven't noticed any significant difference in texture or complexion.  Would I buy this again? Definitely. Its a great, safe, option for a moisturizer."

I don't mind avoiding fragrance because my skin is sensitive, but the natural scent of this product was so bad I was holding my breath while applying and eventually just gave it to a friend. If the smell was more tolerable I would have continued using it because it truly works great for dry/sensitive skin and I have a lot of respect for Biossance as a company. I recommend it for those who don't have strong senses of smell but I couldn't handle it."

I would definitely repurchase and recommend to people with dry skin."

I've seen others comment that after a while it starts to smell. I have found this too. It wasn't enough to notice, but when I opened a new bottle I noticed that it smelled much nicer than my old one. I think it is because as time passes, dipping your fingers into the bottle deposits bacteria and those accumulate in the product. I solved this by tranfering the cream into a pump bottle that I bought of amazon (kind of looks like the drunk elephant protini bottle). It's kind of a hassle, but the product is so good I don't mind. I hope they switch to more hygenic packaging in the future!"

I wouldn't go wild and slather it on thick in the summer time if you're like me and have combination skin, but a nice thin layer of it works perfectly for me.   I'm very confused by the reviews commenting on the smell. It definitely doesn't have a fake, sweet parfume smell, but it also doesn't have a u201csouru201d odor. I find it to have a pretty plain scent, similar to other unscented products. But, everyone's scent is different, so it's possible it comes off more earthy to others.    The price point is high, but the quality and clean ingredients justify it for me. This is the first Biossance product I have used, and I'm really looking forward to purchasing others.

After I use it, I notice that my skin looks and sometimes feels renewed (refreshed is impossible, without a latte macchiato in hand). It's almost as like you wore highlighter to bed and it didn't come off on the pillow, your skin looks dewy and feels hydrated after a hard night sleep.  First, all you'll need is 1-2 dime size dollops of the product, warmed up in your hands, and it smoothly glides across and nourishes every part of your face and neck. Using too much, it'll start to feel heavy.  Understandably, for some individuals this product will be too rich for their skin, this product is made for those with naturally dehydrated skin (like mine). It doesn't always matter how much or how often you stay hydrated, sometimes your skin needs a little boost from your skincare routine. The omega fatty acids and hyaluronic acids in this product will do the exactly that, give your skin the boost it desperately needs.   I cannot complain when I have an eczema flare-up either, it doesn't irritate the outbreak spots at all. Seriously, my desert-skinned sisters, try it.   Listen to your skin, be kind to your skin, love your skin."

This past year I've began exploring skincare on YouTube and discovered my acne was due to my over-dried, and in turn irritated skin. I ditched my drying topical treatments and bought the youth to the people kale cleanser, and this. Simple as that. I'd remove my makeup with micellar water, cleanse, and apply the cream, would sometimes also pat cereve moisturizer on top. I have no issue with the smell complained about in a few reviews, If anything it's a relief to me as fragrance is extremely irritating to my skin! In a week a noticed a huge difference, months later I'm the most confident I've been in years. Biossance is by no means on the cheap side, but the results I've gotten out of this cream are leaps and bounds more than expected from a moisturizer. Clear skin and the restored confidence is priceless to me!! Photos are before and after I started using :)"

I have skin sensitivity issues so I have to change it up and I have to mess around with it just like a cook would in the kitchen for a recipe and I've used eye creams around my mouth to help with lines and I'm going to try this on under my eyes now because it is EXTREMELY rick and does REALLY well with my skin in conjunction with the other product lines I've mentioned above.  I'm 47 and I've done some cigarette smoking and I'm trying to stop and if I had not taken care of my skin so much over the years I would look really bad right now but these products ARE helping me improve my skin while I taper off smoking/quit.  Read some articles about aging/smoking/turning 50+ and what happens and that will definitely help one quit smoking HOWEVER...my skin looks amazing because of these products.  It's definitely taken a hit due to medical/personal issues but these products have been EXTREMELY IMPACTING on recovering my skin, again, I just turned 47.  Biossance + Dr. Dennis Gross + Ole Henrickson = TOP FAVS + well priced especially considering the return of these products.  Investing in a bit at a time helps as well as using enough/not to much and ensuring you fully use all of the product.  I've cut tubes open to get the rest of the product out.  I do NOT waste my skincare products and I ensure that I use ALL of it."

After using this for a couple days, my skin has improved drastically. It's comfortable to wear during the day as well. Doesn't feel heavy or sticky.   Yes, it does smell quite terribly. BUT you can literally smell it for only a few seconds before it dissipates. Just breathe through your mouth during application. I prefer this than fragranced creams. Totally worth it for me."

However, I can see this being too greasy for normal to oily skin. The creamy texture is on the oily side, like any other squalane product I have used before. The biggest draw back is the smell. It's a pro and con. Pro because it's clearly formulated with added scents, but I wish they would somehow neutralize the smell. It smells like a cross between melted plastic and feet that is really hard to get past. However, it disappears shortly after application when it gets absorbed and not strong enough for others to notice on you. If you are someone who have dry skin and sensitive to a variety of perfumes and essential oils, I would recommend this. I would consider purchasing the full size, but I will be trying out other products first."

Noticed breakouts on my forehead the morning after the first time using it, but maybe it was just a coincidence. Haven't noticed any extreme breakouts since, but its just too oily for me.

I'm sure I damaged my skin horribly by using this drugstore moisturizer somehow... my face WAS ANGRY.  I was hoping it was just resurfacing from my resurfacing cleanser. But it continues FOR WEEKS, and  I have been using that, every other day, for a year and a half with no issues. When the new moisturizer came, IT GOT WORSE. My face would burn HORRIBLY, and it seemed like my face didnt even want to absorb it... I ended up up with red, dry/flaky patches on my neck, and under my eyes were peeling and so sore.  Enter in Biossance. I bought the ENTIRE  anti-aging line and my face loved it immediately  After using this moisturizer, my face is finally so soft and not peeling/burning anymore... Love it!"

Within one use my skin felt more plump and hydrated. Safe to use AM and PM, but now that my skin is finally re hydrated, I'll prob just use at night."

In addition, I feel like the texture is really weird, it is almost waxy and it does want to blend out on my skin evenly or skin in. It leaves a film on my skin with a white cast, not that I mind the white cast b/c I use this product at night, but I mean I have dryer skin and I live in upstate NY(winter here is terrible)so I like heavy things. This thing is heavy but it is floating on the top of the skin, not really moisturizing. Plus it smells like straight plastic.

I have to be careful what I use on my skin because it is very prone to clogging and whiteheads, so I had started layering several lighter weight products to try to moisturize my skin,  This cream is like a miracle.  First of all, there is no detectable fragrance which I love!  It hydrates my skin beautifully, yet does not cause my pores to clog or cause breakouts.  Wears beautifully under makeup.  I have been using it morning and night since I tried it, and I am going to Sephora today to buy the full size jar.  I would give this cream 100 stars if I could, it is that wonderful.  I want to say thank you Biossance for making this fabulous cream.  I am so happy that I found it."

It didn't cause any problems like break outs or irritation but it just made my skin feel sort of sticky and heavy, which I didn't like. I prefer when my moisturizer absorbs and leaves my skin feeling supple and hydrating but not weighed down. Unlike many of the other users, I didn't mind the smell very much and I love the ingredients list so I'm bummed that it didn't work out for me but it just wasn't a good fit.

And if you equate Valerian with good things like I do, no big deal.  I much prefer to not have perfume in my skincare products, since I can't use anything with added fragrance.  My only issue is that jar packaging tends to make ingredients degrade faster and allow more bacteria into the product over the course of its life, so I prefer tube packaging.  It looks less glamorous, but I like my products to work just as well on their last day as their first.  I added this to my favorites list anyway."

I literally tried 10 moisturizers or more last year, to the point where my friends were making fun of me. This moisturizer is the only one I could find besides bee yummy skinfood that made my skin feel hydrated for more than a few hours, like a rich cream, but did not cause break outs. Best of all, it actually reduced my sensitivity and I believe has built up my thin skin, so now I can use products that I was too sensitive for. I hope this never stops being made! My only issue is the unhygienic packaging, although I appreciate the sustainability..."

After trying a few things, I found Biossance about 2-3 months ago and I've fallen in love. The brand has many of the same beliefs Aveda has and packaging is even kind of similar. The similarities end there. The product actually does what it claims. My skin looks awesome and fine lines and wrinkles I'd been worrying about are slowly diminishing. I love that this product is very rich and thick without being heavy or greasy. It completely settles into my skin after about 30 minutes. When I wake up in the morning, my skin still feels hydrated and looks dewy. My complexion and uneven skin tone has evened out and I haven't had any issues with breakouts on my extremely sensitive skin. I'm really impressed and I will be with this skincare line for a while. I'm using other products in the line as well and I've been equally happy with those. The downfalls are price, but you do get a reasonable amount of product and it lasts, and the smell. I feel like it smells somewhere between homemade bread and a brewery. Very yeasty, earthy smell. I don't hate the smell, I don't love it. For what the product does I can definitely look past it and I'd rather the smell than some nasty chemical fragrance covering it up. I can see it being an issue for some, however. Regardless, I highly recommend!"

It's heavy so I use it only at night but I wake up looking hydrated and fresh and clear.  It's seriously amazing.  The scent fades very quickly but the results do not.  I will continue to purchase this and the whole Biossance line, it has done AMAZING things for my skin and I get compliments about my u201cglowu201d all the time."

Even though it claims to be good for all skin types I think this product is definitely better suited for dry skin types because the product sat on top of my skin for far too long after massaging it into my face for quite a bit of time.

I ordered an individual Play! box with this product in hopes of finding a great hydrator and im so pleased! my skin is glowing the way it does in the summer! it also looks plump and the texture of my skin looks smoother (i have many very tiny acne scars, nothing dramatic, but it is a concern of mine). Best of all, my skin is soft and moisturized! Will it work in the summer? I don't know but im willing to try it out considering how quickly this delivered results. I knocked off a star for price point. Seems steep for under 2 oz., but take into consideration i compared this against La Mer and i think this worked WAY better. I'm def gonna buy the full sized product."

I haven't had any breakouts because of this moisturizer and I think it's really is u201crepairingu201d my skin because a lot of my PIH from acne is fading more quickly without any additional changes to my skin care routine.

I must be picky because this is not it. I've tried many different face creams, estee Lauder, dr dennis gross, shishedo, DE (both lala and protini), origins and olehenriksen, some high end and some mid range and this stuff manages to be both greasy and not hydrating at the same time. the texture is nice and light but it goes on and almost immediately disappears leaving a greasy film  behind. I usually end up re moisturizing a while later. it also stinks. no no no.  I am returning it tomorrow and already repurchased DE protini for daytime and will stick with Lala for night."

The smell does eventually go away once you work it in and it's been on for a while but it is absolutely horrendous. I'm not a fan of synthetic fragrances in beauty products but this is one of the worst smelling products I've ever encountered and could do with at least a natural fragrance if there's one that non-irritating. I'm going to try and finish it up (because I obviously paid for it) but would not repurchase or recommend. If it had no smell I'd say it's a pretty good moisturizer for dry to very dry skin but the smell completely ruins it for me. Still gave it three stars since it's actually a good product bar the odor which cost it two stars."

I feel that I have gained sensitivity to fragrance in skincare/makeup products over the years. Now, it just irritates my skin so I am trying to shift away from those types of products. This product is also vegan and has a bunch of fatty acids that is just so good for your face especially for acne-prone skin. It creates a barrier on your skin to prevent transepidermal water loss - and that is awesome for my dehydrated skin - thanks to the squalane. It does take a bit of time to massage to your face especially if you put too much. Feels like rubbing a sunscreen but it doesn't bother me since I love it so much. I use it day and night. This will forever be a staple on my skincare regimen until they stop producing it (I hope not!)"

I will say that this cream makes my skin feel soft to the touch, but I don't exactly believe that it is very moisturizing or hydrating. It also leaves my face feeling slightly oily/greasy after application, to the point that it's uncomfortable. I am used to the feeling of moisturizer and have never had this issue before. I actually had to blot my face after applying. The smell doesn't bother me that much. Sometimes I felt like it smelled like cinnamon? I've been using it for a couple weeks and unfortunately I will be returning it because it has caused texture/tiny clogged pores on both of my cheeks. Wish it worked for me, but I'm definitely disappointed. Also, I agree with other reviews acknowledging the little amount of product you get for the price.

It occurred to me that this moisturizer is like the guy (or girl)  you marry after you've dated around for years, ha ha. The best quality, in my opinion, is that it hydrates the skin without greasiness which makes it a phenomenal morning moisturizer.  It works so well under makeup.

He said perioral dermitis is hard to cure and I need to take antibiotics, but caution because you may have vomiting, diarrhea....all the fun stuff.

Once I was a few months from hitting 25 and started noticing my face change I realized I needed to start taking care of my skin. I've found a good skincare regimen with a combination of The Ordinary and Herbivore products. However, the NYC winter air has been a little too much for my dry skin and I needed a more substantial moisturizer from a cream. I've tried a few samples from other cruelty-free brands at Sephora and none had really wowed me yet, but this did. I noticed pretty immediate help for the dryer spots of my face and moisture lasts all day without feeling greasy. It may be too much moisture for someone with Oily skin. It's unscented so it has a slight fatty smell but it goes away almost immediately and I don't really notice it. The smell is similar to Drunk Elephant's La La cream but much less intense. You also don't have to use a lot as it spreads really well and I appreciate that it will last longer than other brands with 50ML of product that are more expensive. Biossance is also an environmentally responsible company using renewable sugarcane for the squalene on top of being a cruelty-free company using good ingredients so it's a win for me."

BUT, since I'd never tried a Biossance product that clogged my pores or broke me out, I decided to get a sample anyways and give it a go.  WOW is this product an exception to that!! When you first feel this cream, it will seem thick, but when you smooth it onto your skin, (little goes a long way) it absorbs so quickly and doesn't feel like you have this layer on your skin. It's also calming and makes my skin instantly feel comfortable (even when it's angry at me). NEVER broke me out or clogged pores and had no problems using it over existing blemishes (which is rare).   When you wake up and look in the mirror, it's almost shocking how much this evens skin tone, almost completely takes away any redness (coming from someone with Rosacea nonetheless!), and even somehow takes away any bumpy texture or inflammation I had (which I NEVER thought a cream could do)!  Seriously, if you have combo, dry, or oily yet dehydrated skin (ESPECIALLY if your natural moisture barrier has been damaged from winter or too much cleansing/exfoliation), this is a MUST try!!!   It balances out my oily and dry areas and repairs my moisture barrier faster than any of the dozens of products I've tried (from cheap to very expensive)."

I was using DE cream for several months but as the air got drier, so as my face and DE cream was no longer able to keep my skin moisturized. After my own intense research of u201ccleanu201d products I decided to give this one a shot. I know the price will make you cringe and cry for a week, but honestly it's worth every penny. My boyfriend always comments on how soft my face is, and this is the only thing that I changed in my daily facial routine. I saw some reviewers mentioning of bad scent. I really don't know what they're talking about because this product virtually has no scent. It has a very light u201cnaturalu201d odor which one can expect in every product that is fragrance-free, but I only smell it when I actually stick my nose in the jar. I'm picky with scents and since I have a sensitive skin I'm always in search of unscented products. This product doesn't bother me at all (unlike unrefined shea butter whose earthy scent hits you the moment you pop off the lid). Already purchased a second jar. Highly recommend!"

A little goes a long way and I'm already on my second jar.  For me, a jar lasts approximately 3-4 months which for the size, I think is appropriate. I'm now in my fourth month of daily use and can honestly say this has become my holy grail lightweight moisturizer.  I would rate this 4.5 stars if I could.  The only reason for the 4.5 star rating is because when the weather is dry and cold, I don't feel it is as moisturizing as say Lala-Retro.  For a spring-fall cream, I think it is great for both morning and evening use.  In the winter I personally like to use it at night and the Lala during the day.  However, keep in mind I have senstive skin and due to chronic hives I need a bit extra moisture than most.  I highly recommend the Squalane and Omega cream for anyone who is looking for a nice, light, and soft cream for daytime or night time use."

However, after 3 weeks of using it daily, I didn't notice any significant improvements to my skin (in texture or complexion). Also, once you wash your face, the whole u201chydration effectu201d is gone, so it doesn't really cure it, so to say. I don't know if that's too much to expect from a simple cream, but that's my observation."

I wish this product had SPF so during other seasons, I could use this alone but I still have to double up to have the SPF protection my skin needs!   With that said, I still love this product. The gel texture is great, it dries almost instantly and I can apply my makeup over it in just minutes without any fear of oily skin. I'll still be buying and using this product - but with a SPF moisturizer on top."

It's also a great price point. Definitely worth the money."

I did not want to write a review at the beginning of my journey, so I waited and it's been close to a month. I have used this moisturizer after washing my face with a age renewal cream cleanser, toning, and applying a serum not products of biossance. I have had very dry skin with some adult acne on my cheeks occasionally. I have to say the cream moisturizer feels really good on application, it does not have a strong scent, and it seeps in pretty deep into the top layers of my skin. I would occasionally reapply overnight as my skin would get a little dry. I live in a desert and southern California and it's very cold and dry this time of year. I did not see a great change in fine lines, but the dryness was definitely better as a result. I am going to be 40 and I'm definitely having some hormonal changes that has been affecting my skin, so I will continue to use to see what results I have."

My makeup looked smooth and near flawless.   I've also used it before bed and let it work it's magic without makeup on. The formula has a nice, smooth consistency and leaves my skin feeling refreshed and soft. I'm not a huge fan of the smell, it's not bad, but also not good. I would say it's a medicated lotion smell, it's a little off putting but it's not a deal breaker.   A little bit of this goes a long way. Definitely recommend for people who have dry/red skin. I definitely feel much more life in my face when using this product and for days after if I miss a couple days. I Highly recommend it."

After using just a light application of this cream at night on my dry red rough patches (from the wind) I awoke to soft smooth plumped skin with reduced redness. Because my skin was hydrated it was also much easier to exfoliate and not get further irritated. While the smell isn't great it's a plus in my opinion as it means that no fragrance or extra ingredients are added, keeping this product as pure as it can be.  This will be a lifelong product!"

This stuff has no fragrance. There's somewhat of a natural scent but it dissipates fast. I've tried many creams on my son who has been having issues with eczema on his hands.  No matter what we used on him, his hands kept getting any and cracked with this cold weather.  One night, I had him try this.  His skin ate it up!!  He started getting just a tad, every night and I can't believe the amazing difference!  I'm soooo very thankful something is helping him!!!  We aren't telling Dad about it though!!$$$$$$ lol!!"

After 3 weeks of using it regularly, here are my thoughts: . Before receiving this cream, I was breaking out like crazy and didn't really know what was causing it. I decided to stop everything I was using and simplified my skincare. I was apprehensive to try the cream at first,  but I'm glad I did because I'm in love with this cream. It's unscented, absorbs quickly, and makes your skin feel smooth and healthy. It didn't break me out and I helped calm my skin. So happy with this cream and excited to try other products from Biossanceu2764 . Quick Info: This cream has squalane, omega fatty acids, ceramides, and plant sterols. It is non-toxic, paraben free, phthalate free, mineral oil free, and fragrance free. . #biossancexinfluenster #biossance #contest #complimentary"

And nothing compares to this, It feels luxurious and it an amazing cream that calms the skin, deeply moisturizes, leaves your skin glowy. I love that is clean skincare and also the smell smells pleasant. I don't understand this fishy scent everyone keeps talking about. IT IS A CLEAN SKINCARE PEOPLE, it is not suppose to have any scent (if it does, it will smell natural like this one) or heavily scent at all. If your moisturizer has a heavy scent it is a no no. Really bad for your face. I don't think i'm going back to any other moisturizer. This is the best, not even Lamer overly perfumed moisturizers have the same benefits and luxury feeling to this."

I have sensitive skin, usually combination, but this winter California weather has made it more dry and flaky. I'm 32, wanting something to revitalize my face and prevent any aging.  Initially the packaging is so luxurious. Honestly its not something that I would think to purchase for myself. The container feels heavy and it felt expensive, - coming from someone who usually purchases drug store brands. I decided to test out the cream on the base of my neck to test out the product with my skin,  it was so soft! The next day, knowing that I didn't get a reaction, I put it on my face. It felt very nice, not greasy, I used it in the evening because its fairly thick. I plan to try it under makeup one day, but have not yet. It does have a slight scent, but I stopped noticing it after a few minutes. So far so great, I hope I continue to see a difference."

It's thick (so a little goes a long way), but just sinks riiiight into your skin.   I've used plenty of heavy moisturizers that just sit right on top of your skin, without ever really absorbing.  Not this one!! My skin literally drank it in, and looks so smooth and dewy. And - bonus for anyone with adult-acne-prone skin (like me!) - it won't break you out! I was so relieved and pleasant surprised, since many heavier creams do make me break out.  Pro tip: put it on right before bed and go to sleep. The next day, don't wash it off! Either leave it be, or spritz a very light mist of water on top and gently pat it in. Then apply foundation/concealer right on top; the moisturizer acts very much like a primer, saving you a step and giving you glowy skin.  Full disclosure: I received this product for free for sampling purposes, but the opinions expressed are my own! :-)"

However, I noticed that I wake up in the morning with my face feeling tight and dry. I'm not sure why. I am applying a good amount to my face. However, when I apply this moisturizer in the day time, it's the perfect amount of moisture. I'm going to keep trying it out to see if my face adapts to it at night. Also, another con is the smell. I'm not sure why the product smells the way it does. It's not a very pleasant smell. However, i would rather take this smell over products that smell too good. I think that's a sign that chemicals have been used.  All in all, I would say I like this moisturizer so far. Aside from my face feeling tight in the morning, my complexion looks bright and glowing.
