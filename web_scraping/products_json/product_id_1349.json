I have really sensitive skin but this doesn't break me out or cause any irritation. My only complaint is that the packaging tends to leak, so I hope they fix that at some point. The blush is so good that I'm willing to overlook this issue."

            "review_text": "I recently tried the Rare Beauty Soft Pinch Liquid Blush in the shade Love (matte terracotta), and I can confidently say it\'s a game-changer! The warm terracotta tone is perfect for that natural, sun-kissed flush, and it works beautifully on most skin tones.    What I loved: - Amazing pigment:  This blush is super pigmented. Seriously, one tiny dot is all you need for both cheeks. It\'s great because it\'ll last forever, but it does take some practice to get it just right.   - Blends like a dream: Once you figure out the right amount, it blends out so smoothly\u2014whether you use your fingers, a brush, or a sponge. It leaves this really soft, natural finish that doesn\'t look heavy at all.   - Stays all day:I was impressed by how long it lasted. Even after a full day, it still looked fresh, which is awesome if you\'re not into touching up.   - Lightweight feel:It doesn\'t feel cakey or sticky, which I love. It\'s like you\'re not even wearing blush!    A couple of things to watch for: -  Go easy at first: Since it\'s super pigmented, it\'s easy to overdo it. Start small\u2014you can always add more if needed!   - Applicator design: The doe-foot applicator is cute, but it can dispense more than you need, so be careful when applying.    Overall, I love this blush. It\'s perfect for adding warmth and a natural glow to your makeup look. It might take a little trial and error to master, but it\'s 100% worth it.   Would totally recommend it if you\'re looking for a long-lasting, easy-to-blend blush that gives you a gorgeous flush!"

I have four shades of this formula in varying sizes, from samples, deluxe mini's and full size.  The formula remains the same across sizes and shades in my opinion.  I found the biggest drawback of this formula is that it can be too pigmented.  I love a blush heavy look but find that even so, I need to put the product on the back of my hand, spread it out with a finger then use my blush brush to pick up product to put onto my face.  Once I get the product on it looks great and blends nicely.  It lasts about 6-8 hours on me if I don't set it with a powder blush on top, which is average for me with blush products. The biggest drawback for me with this product is that when I try to apply it directly to my face, it's VERY easy to end up with too much product or if I use a very very tiny dot it takes forever to blend out.  This leaves me with smearing it on the back of my hand first.  For me, this is just an extra step that other blushes don't need.  I also wonder how long it would take someone to fully use up one of the full size products with daily use?  The smaller mini sizes I have think would last way longer necessary."

This formula is also matte, it's a little too dry of a formula for me, but if you prefer a matte formula, you'll probably love this! Still a pretty color, flattering shade,  and a great product - but I will for sure be reaching for other shades more."

I recommend applying it to your hand and then dabbing on the tiniest amount because the Grateful shade is insanely pigmented. I have fair olive skin and it is a beautiful and very natural looking blush color for me. It is not sticky at all and dries down so a nice natural finish. Overall I'm loving it after a few uses and I think this tube will last for eternity."

But this product almost seems like you have to buy the rare beauty brand in order for it to blend correctly. I was super excited to buy this but truly was disappointed with how this applied. Maybe it is because it is a matte blush. This is why I typically stick to powdered blushes because they normally stay applied to my face."

Even if they don\'t leak out of the outside of the bottle, they get all over the rim and it\'s overall not a great experience when you\'re doing your makeup."

Make sure to wipe the excess off of the wand before applying. I recommend letting it sit on your skin a few moments to warm the product to your skins temperature - this makes a huge difference in blending it out for a natural look. If you find that you've used too much, use a dry fluffy brush and dab over it until it has muted to your preference. I find joy to be super flattering. Not too pink, not too orange, not too dark. It looks very natural - like coming back from vacation with a sunny glow. You know when you've been smiling a lot and the shade of your cheeks is rosy and looks so healthy? This is THAT in a bottle."

For those with warm undertones, the blushes in shades like Love (a soft pink) or Joy (a bright, warm coral) create a vibrant, sun-kissed look. On the other hand, cool-toned beauties will adore shades like Grateful (a deep rose) or Nearly Mauve (a cool, dusty pink), which provide a soft, romantic flush that complements cooler skin tones perfectly.

I am someone who does not look good on bright colors as I am very muted in skintone and I dislike super cool lilac purple or peach orange warm tones.  I find neutral pink to look most natural as if I am truly blushing. I will def buy the big size.

The liquid blush does not seem to last very long though. Using the powder blush as a topper might help to improve the longevity, but there are certain areas I'd rather not use the Rare Beauty powder blush on because of its highlighting properties.

The color was nice and the texture of it was also really pleasing, it feels more powdery than greasy, which was something I wasnt really expecting.However, the pigment tends to fade in an hour or so, so I wouldn\'t call it all day wear. It\'s been about 9ish months since I\'ve bought it and i barely reach for it anymore. But all in all, its not bad, but for 24 dollars i think you can find better in that price range."

The packaging is beautiful and easy to access, you get a great amount of product in each component, and the formula is to die for. I currently have shades Happy, Grateful, and Lucky, which I each love for different reasons. Happy is a great everyday pink shade, Grateful is a natural looking true red that can also be used to create a fiery statement color, and Lucky is an absolutely stunning bright fuchsia. And let me say that the pigment for all of these...unmatched. It's not the hardest thing in the world to make a pigmented liquid blush, but it is hard to make a SUPER pigmented liquid blush that also happens to be lightweight and easy to blend...and that's these. These are so pigmented I don't ever think I'll have to repurchase because you really don't have to use very much, especially for the super pigmented shades like Lucky. I can see how for some people that might be an issue if they want a more sheer blush look, but I achieve that by placing the blush on the hand/wrist first and then blending it into the cheeks with a sponge (or a brush, if I want more pigment). These are so so so worth the hype and I can't say enough good things about this product. If you haven't tried these yet, and you love a pigmented liquid blush, run, don't walk!!"
