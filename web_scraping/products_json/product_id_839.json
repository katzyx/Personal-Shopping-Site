I notice an immediate glow and reduction in dullness, like Iu2019ve just had a mini facial at home.Over time, my skin texture has noticeably improved. It feels more refined, and Iu2019ve seen a reduction in tiny bumps and uneven areas.

I think for me it works great as a once in a while exfoliating treatment. The key is to only use a very small amount and only for the short two minutes it directs. If you have sensitive skin, starting with a shorter duration could even be beneficial. I found my skin to be very smooth and exfoliated after using this product. Iu2019ll definitely keep using this and will consider rebuying. One thing I didnu2019t know about this is the color and scent. I did not know it was such a green color. Neat plus you can tell how much youu2019ve actually put on. The scent is almost a leafy green scent with a bit of mint or acid to it. Not something I would necessarily want to smell like but it does smell like an effective skincare product. Equating this scent to the taste of food, itu2019s like when you taste a food and can tell itu2019s good for you. On the packaging, I think the tube option is a good choice to keep it air tight. Also the smiley face is cute."

First time I used this was long time ago, it says leave on for 2 mins, then rinse off. My stubborn self thought hmm maybe longer will do better results, so I think I left it on for 5-10 mins, god no, don't ever do that, because it tingled so bad, I have anxiety when washing my face at the sink so that didn't help with the cloth, rough... skin felt like it was on fire and looked pinkish-red due to the over exfoliation time, then went for a jog with the puppy outside in the winter over the holidays, the wind didn't help, looked like wind burn but wasn't. lol. I learnt from that big time, other than that horrible first experience of mine years ago, I learnt & only leave it on for 2 minutes then rinse, i only use it in the shower, not only exfoliates the surface but it really penetrates and gets under the surface, cleans your pores, gets the guck trapped in there, lifts it out. leaves your face feeling fresh, so soft, so clean."

This physical (silica), chemical (AHA lactic acid + BHA salicylic acid) and enzymatic (papaya, pineapple + pumpkin enzymes) exfoliant is a thin gel consistency with a light refreshing scent. I love how it gently removes dead skin cells to not only bring out a healthy glow but also create a wonderful base for skincare to be even more effective and makeup to apply more evenly.

I wish the box/bottle mentioned the chemical exfoliants too. The treatment is a fun (funky!) deep green color almost like seaweed, but the smell reminds me almost of red hot cinnamon candy mixed with skincare. And that was good, because it did burn a bit while using on my most sensitive parts, like near my nose and undereye.   I followed directions and made sure to only have it on for about a minute because I do have sensitive skin overall, and I think that was wise! I didn't feel dried out or over-processed, and was easily hydrated when I moisturized afterwards. To make sure it came off quickly and completely, I used a small damp makeup eraser microfiber cloth while rinsing, and it was super helpful."

I did notice a slight tingle when I first apply this, but nothing too intense. It has a nice, fresh scent too. Well worth the price in my opinion."

That is when you feel the actual potency of the exfoliator, so if you have sensitive skin use this carefully. But let me tell you, my skin, WOW, after the first use my pores became less noticeable.

Iu2019ve been using it for awhile and my skin did go through a purging stage when I first started using it but then it calmed down afterwards.

The tube lasts forever--even the mini size will last a while, because you only need a small amount for each use.  A word of caution, I definitely damaged my skin barrier using this all the time (my fault, not the product). Incorporating it into my routine once or twice a week now works great. It'll leave your skin smooth with a nice glow, and you may feel like you want that all the time but less is really more."

You only use a little bit at a time so I feel a mini is probably best for ensuring you have the freshest product. Also a note, I have very sensitive skin and this hasnu2019t irritated me at all. I rub it onto my face in small circles and let it sit for about 2 minutes before I wash it off as instructed. I usually just do it while Iu2019m in the shower and shave my legs or whatever while Iu2019m letting it sit.

Upon application, it stung a little and after washing it off my face was RED. I recommend applying Marula oil (or any other deeply hydrating oil) followed by a moisturizer (I used my Moon Juice moisturizer). The next day my face was still slightly pink but my skin was so so smooth, and all my blackheads that were hurried deep down were now at the surface ready for easy extraction (gross I know). However this is the ONLY product that helped me resurface my skin and not break me out. Yes the irritation was there (no this is not your hydrafacial spa treatment) but the results are amazing and my skin looked really good, smooth and with less texture on the second and third day. I highly recommend this product if you willing to accept the burn and exfoliation. I have tried other exfoliators such as goop, dr jart microdermabrasion, Paulas Choice BHA (which is completely ineffective itu2019s just PR), Tara harper, the ordinary peel, COSRX, countless mud masks, etc etc but nothing gave me the deep clean results as this product. For reference I have acne prone/combination/texture/pores/dehydrated skin. I hope this review helps !"

The smell is OKAYY, it's not spa-like heavenly, but it's not hard on the nose either. But with that said, I do find this rather expensive, and there are lots of more affordable exfoliating treatments that are just as effective. But also, if you are already using other products containing AHAs and exfoliating properties that you use regularly (e.g. cleanser, toner), I found that the small 0.5 oz size lasts pretty long, since I don't need to use it very often, so you can keep that in mind when considering the size to purchase. I think this has its place for some people, but for me, I prefer another less expensive and slightly less intensive exfoliating mask."

Let me explain:   The mini, whewu2026this is not worth $25. The amount of product is, honestly, what Iu2019d expect from one of the Bazaar Rewards (maybe like a 250 pointer/500 in a kit). You need to use a little because if you donu2019t, youu2019d absolutely be wasting your money. Iu2019d say wait for a sale, or get a sample in store if possible before committing. Itu2019s definitely not a HG for me personally. Iu2019d say if you can commit to the larger size during a sale, go for it. Itu2019s good for sensitive skin, the smell isnu2019t overwhelming at all and just because it isnu2019t my HG does not mean it wonu2019t be yours. For these reasons, I still recommend it. Just not at the mini size (just not enough product to get the full picture for results, in my opinion).

Oh god, it burns. Badly. And Iu2019m not stranger to acids, my skin usually loves them..but this, oh god. But I refused to give up bc of the results.. however the last few times I used it my skin was red and slightly sand paper/rough feeling the next few days. My makeup looked cracked. At first I thought maybe this was causing a u201cpeelingu201d effect due to how effective it exfoliates..however, actually think it might be a low level scabbing due to the burning, and not just dead skin cells or dryness u201cpeelingu201d. I think this stuff actually burned the top layer of my skin. And not in a good way. Itu2019s a shame, the results were great, but not if itu2019s actually burning the surface of my skin."

It is an intense treatment so definitely not something you use daily or your skin will dry out. And if you do have sensitive or dry skin I would try maybe patch testing to make sure you donu2019t break out in irritation. After washing with this you will have the perfect foundation application.

However, it only burns for like 30 secs, and I found that after I make it past that point, my face gets used to it and it's only a slight tingle. I usually leave it on for 5 min without even realizing it because it doesn't burn once I get past that initial 30 secs. After I take it off, my face is sooo soft and smooth! This mask is amazing! Honestly, if you want something that'll actually fix your skin's texture and resurface your face, and actually effect some real change, you'll probably have to endure some discomfort. As soon as I take it off, my face isn't red at all, and all the tingling is gone. It definitely gives results worth a few mins of tingling! I've used it for a few weeks, twice a week, and I can absolutely see a difference. All the darker spots on my chin from past acne are looking better, all the blemishes on my face are gone, and overall my skin looks brighter and healthier. I literally feel like it's burning away the old, damaged layers of skin slowly, and I'm growing new healthier skin in its place! Everyone should, at least, give the mini size a try! I will 100% definitely be repurchasing!"

I don't have a lot of disposable income and the price tag guts me every time but IT IS SO WORTH IT. A little product goes a long way, and since it is a bit of a more intensive exfoliating treatment, I don't need to use it with extreme frequency and it actually lasts me quite a while. My skin always feels so soft and smooth after I use it, and I personally love the way it smells. Since I started using this product my skin has become so much more clear and my dark spots have faded. It takes a few months for full cell turnover but it's very clearly effective. If you're on the fence about trying it, or the price tag causes you to pause, I can assure you it is worth it to at least try the travel size. You really won't regret it. I never have."

I have always had clear skin so when I started experiencing my breakouts, I felt subconscious and wanted to do something about it. I started to drink more water and eat better as I feel that these are two important steps to take, then I updated my skin care routine. I purchased the mini size exfoliator and decided to give it a try. When I first used it, I felt a little tingle as I rubbed it on my face but I liked the feeling. Then, I let it sit on my face and finally washed it off. My face felt clean and had a glow so I was impressed but still had to continue to use it to see if my acne and hyperpigmentation got better. Now I have been using this exfoliator for two months and my skin looks and feels amazing. In the beginning, I used this product once a week but now I use it every four days. Most of my dark spots faded away and I do not have as many breakouts as I had before. I am happy that I found something that actually worked for my combination skin type because I truly feel better about my skin. It is pricey but a little goes along way and honestly Iu2019m not cheap with myself so whatever baby wants, baby GETS!"

But above all, the price in NO WAY justifies the product. There are so many other combo physical & chemical exfoliants out there. My personal favourite is the Peter Thomas Roth Pumpkin Enzyme. Less than half the price for 5oz, in comparison to this. Also have recently tried the Pixie Peel & Polish. Please just don't think this is your only option! A great moisturizer to follow an exfoliating treatment is your best friend. First Aid Beauty is a great one for that."

I am HOOKED even though the first time was awful!"

My skin is dry and somewhat sensitive so anything that strips it of itu2019s natural oils makes my skin very dehydrated! Most of the facial scrubs Iu2019ve tried so far contained clay which is the most drying ingredient you can use in your skin. I received this in my Allure box and looked up the ingredients immediately. Iu2019ve never heard of it before so I was very interested in trying it. I love all of the ingredients, except for 1: alcohol denation. I am still unclear as to what this ingredient would do to my skin but I read that it causes dryness, irritation and acne. Well, Iu2019ve used this exfoliator around 4 times now and my skin feels and looks amazing after using it. So, perhaps it contains a very small amount? I think this mask would be PERFECT without that ingredients. Pumpkin enzymes are one of the best ingredients for exfoliating the skin without stripping it and it contains honey, an antibacterial and nourishing ingredient! Itu2019s not harsh, at all and it actually feels a bit moisturizing! Thereu2019s no fine grains that are harsh. It has a creamy texture. You leave it on for 2 minutes after exfoliating to let the product do itu2019s worth. Thatu2019s really great if you donu2019t have the time to do a facial mask!!! I do want to buy this and give it a longer trial run just to make sure that the denatured alcohol wonu2019t cause skin issues and I am very thankful that this comes in a sample size!! I recommend it for anybody!!"

I like when you exfoliate, and feel a sensation like you actually did something. It tingles and my face goes red for a little while and then feels the softest it has ever been. I cannot get these results with anything else. Mary Kay exfoliation comes close to it minus the ingredients you get in this. The price is what I cannot get past. I got mine in a subscription box. I have to hope to get it again in this form because $120 is just too much."

It also helps keep my acne at bay and leaves me with a really lovely glow. Just make sure to use a good moisturizer afterwards because it can can be a bit drying. I like to use regular grocery store coconut oil after this exfoliator. I usually go for the mini size, because the large one takes me ages to get through and my wallet cringes at having to drop over $100 (CAD) on one skincare product. I usually find that the mini size takes about 2 months to go through if I use it 1x a week, and 1 month if I use it 2x a week. It's expensive but I find that it's worth its price.  Just a tip: Once you've used up quite a bit and you're starting to have trouble squeezing the product out, cut the top off of the tube off, and then use a clip (like a small bull clip or even a bobby pin) to close the top and prevent the product from drying out. You  can use your fingers to scoop out the product, and re-clip for the next use. This way, you can get every last bit!"

It does sting for a minute and may be too intense of an exfoliant for some.   I'd also like to point out that the reformulated product no longer contains polyethylene (those harmful microbeads.) This a statement made by Kate Somerville: Due to a recent federal ban on the use of polyethylene beads in cosmetic products beginning in 2017, we have replaced the polyethylene beads in ExfoliKate Intensive with natural silica. We did extensive testing to determine that silica delivered the same amazing benefits as polyethylene beads without consumers perceiving the change.   The current ingredients list now reflects this change.  I noticed the first reviews coming up were concerns about the use of polyethylene. It would be a shame if someone were deterred from using this product because of a 4 year old review."

When I looked at my skin it was like I could actually SEE it for the first time. My pores were smaller and any blackheads/congestion I had were obvious and therefore easily removed. I was freaking GLOWING! I've never glown before! Also, as someone with ADHD, skincare has been tough for me my whole life because getting myself to do routine, everyday tasks without immediate rewards feel like torture. A lot of skincare takes time and consistency -- the very two things I struggle with. Getting immediate results like this is a game changer for me. It's motivating and exciting and I WANT to do my skincare routine every night. I will be penniless because now I want to buy all the other products...but at least I'll be glowing."

This green product smells like chai tea almost and has very fine grit in it for a light scrubbing feel. It seems to do what it says.

I expected a bit of burning but it was unbearable to the point I could barely leave it on for 1 minute let alone 2 full minutes. Second issue being that is way more drying than babyfacial. My face felt tense and tight afterwards (good in some ways, not so good in others). Third is that perhaps due to the intensity of this product, I did find myself breaking out ever so slightly.  I also didn't find that it helped at all with pores. All in all, would not use this twice a week as recommended.  That all said, save for the burning, it isn't enough for me to return this product per se. I would recommend only using it in the summer (the harsh dry winter air left me feeling even more dried out after exfolikate) and if you have sensitive skin definitely look for the exfolikate gentle or even better, upgrade to Drunk Elephant. The good? It does work in resurfacing the skin and giving you a dewy look (again, not as nice of a glow as with Drunk Elephant). It also takes very little product for a treatment. If you follow up with a hyper hydrating moisturizer or oil it alleviates some of the issues I had with it drying me out. I could see this being great for the neck/decollete area.   Not be to be a broken record but tbh, if Drunk Elephant hadn't come up with babyfacial, I would probably love this product. It's just hard to have a direct comparison to a product that works better for me."

The scent isnu2019t too strong like other skincare products.  After exfoliating my skin was SO soft. I kept looking at the mirror because it looked so much better.

This stuff right here - I have tried others but I ALWAYS return to this exfoliating treatment.  A little background: I grew up with normal skin, rarely breakout, not super dry not super oily. Then I hit 25 and my face took a TURN. I became incredibly dry, which led me to breakout and have horrible dry patches to the point my skin was flaking and it was awful wearing makeup because everything would just sit on top of the flakes. My esthetician told me that exfoliating, even though I was already dry, would really really help me with the dryness I was experiencing. Cue Kate Somerville Exfolikate. I used this ONE time and I have never ever looked back. It does tingle, but ultimately it eats away at that dead layer of skin you have, leaving my skin free of flakes.   I know its expensive, but I PROMISE you a little goes a long way and this will change your life if you are experiencing any dryness/acne issues. I've been using this for two years and will never go back to anything else."

If you have super sensitive skin, this might be your product, but for me, it did nothing other than cleanse my skin.  I will not purchase again."

I attempted to try this product several times and my face would ALWAYS burn and felt incredibly rough afterwards. I really wanted this product to work so I looked at some of the videos on how to best apply it (which should have been very simple...). But after watching these videos, I noticed how little of the product they use. It's really a pea-size, whereas I was using like the size of ten peas. So I tried using the size of a pea in the shower tonight and surprisingly, my face feels super smooth now! I somehow had the misunderstanding that more = better, but for this product, it seems that less = better. So, if you do happen to experience any burning, I would definitely try using less! Hope this helps. I'll update this review in case I notice any increase in sensitivity or burning sensation the next few times I use it. For the burners out there, hope this is a helpful tip!"

I have battles cystic acne around my chin and mouth and since I gave started using this twice a day, my skin has cleared up greatly. I now use it once a day, a little goes a long way, and yes it does burn a little and will make your skin red if you leave it on too long. But whatever, I take that over acne and red marks any day. I also have darkish spots on my skin from acne scarring or purplish marks from cysts that never break the surface- almost like a small bruise. Itu2019s terrible. But this product has greatly reduced the visibility. I will never stop using this product! I also spot treatment the minute I feel like a cyst or spot is forming and by the next day, itu2019s like it never happened! This truly is a miracle in bottle. I would rate it 10 stars if I could!!"

My skin looked very healthy and fresh, little brighter than before Iufe0f applied the exfoliant. Definitely follow the instructions and apply to a clean face and let Iufe0ft sit for about two minutes. Iufe0ft dried after the two minutes and almost became a light mask. Iufe0f will be using this on my boyfriend because itu2019s a 2-in-1!"

This product is gentle while being comfortably exfoliating and has an interesting but pleasant smell. I will say the first time that I used it, the sensation was intense, but not too strong. My skin is so smooth after using this and the overall texture of my skin including visibility of fine lines on my forehead and around my mouth!

It says to leave the treatment on for 1-2 minutes after rubbing into skin using circular motions but I leave it on about 5 minutes with no problem.  I really love this stuff for about 2-3 hours - it truly is a Hollywood Quicky Facial, as it claims on the packaging.  The biggest downfall is the cost for the measly 1/2 ounce size and the fact the results aren't long-lasting; meaning, you've gotta wait a couple days in between treatments.  Cost is also a factor and I'm not one to ever worry about cost when it comes to my skin care so that is saying a lot!  But it does create beautiful skin if only temporary."

When it comes to price, a little goes a long way with this product. By using small amounts of it, the product lasts pretty long!"

I used probably a bit too much not knowing anything about it, and after I left it on for 2 minutes and washed it off, my nose was covered with extracted gunk from my pores!  I panicked a bit but took a toner on a cotton pad and wiped off all the gunk. My nose is so much smoother now that all the gunk in my pores was extracted. I'll keep using my bottle and may repurchase!"

I was happy that it came in a small tube because it is a bit pricey and I didn't want to be stuck with a large tube if it wasn't as great as I thought after one use. However, it was still amazing. I use it once a week. I only have to use a pea size amount so the small tube lasts a long time. After use, my face looks refreshed, glowing and awake. I love it. The onlly thing is that it is a strong product, so after use I only apply a moisturizer. No serum or anti-aging products, if you have sensitive skin. Also, don't leave it on longer than it says."

The first time I applied it, it did burn sooooo bad, I only left it on for 1 minute and after washing it off, I couldn't believe how soft and smooth my skin felt and looked!!! it didn't leave my skin red or irritated! I use it twice a week, and I still feel some burning first few seconds after applying it, but my skin just feels so soft after using it! If I get a pimple or so, it will peel off the top layer and I just apply spot acne treatment and my moisturizer after and in the morning it looks significantly better! Best exfoliating out there, no doubt!!!"
