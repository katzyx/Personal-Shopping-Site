I like to make a few passes over my lips to get them nicely moistened. It lasts a few hours but not all day, and occasionally my lips get dry and peel if I donu2019t reapply, but that happens with most lipsticks and tinted balms for me. Exfoliate with a little sugar and olive or almond oil, and youu2019re good to go! Iu2019d lament the lack of SPF, but itu2019s not a dealbreaker since Iu2019ve never gotten sunburned on my lips.

But after about 30 minutes, noticed that my lips were very dry--painfully dry--like when I wear a liquid lipstick.  I wiped it off and reapplied, same thing.  Instead of looking hydrated and plump, my lips looked dried-out and shriveled--not the look I'm going for, especially at my age, and they hurt. The color is still lovely (hence the two-star rating), and I still wear it, but when I do, I have to wear another lip balm underneath because this so-called lip treatment is so drying.

I bought one on a trip (no Sephora where I live) and I thought it was just me since I hadn't purchased one is a year or so. I couldn't return so Ive kept using it because it is so expensive! I was with my mother who is also a fan and bought several of the originals before they switched. We shared a bag for our outing and I accidentally grabbed hers and I was FLOORED by the difference. It glides across the lips, feels hydrating, lasting shine, and just a phenomenal product. I was told they changed the formula to remove the SPF to pander to Sephora's clean campaign. I hope they listen to the consumers who want the original product. Definitely will not purchase again or anything within the brand."

However, upon ordering my favorites (Bloom and Rose, which I would always stock up on) I realized the issue was with all the balms. I USED to be the biggest fan of the Fresh Sugar lip treatments. I kept repurchasing this product in multiple colors for nearly 10 years! But, I have now returned my recent orders. The formula has changed and most of the lip balms are very dry (especially compared to the past balms). Also, these no longer have SPF 15 which was one of my favorite things about the product - you got hydrating sun protection in a variety of pretty colors. Thatu2019s why I always had these in my purse, my bathroom, and my office. They were my favorite. The price for these balms hasnu2019t gone down, but the quality definitely has.

I wouldnu2019t use it if it was free, much less pay over $25 for it! So disappointing. Why do companies do this?!?

I had probably gone through two tubes of this over the past few years. Well.... unfortunately, the formula change is VERY noticeable, even to me.  What's different:   - The packaging is less heavy/less luxe feeling; it's immediately noticeable - This formula feels far more drying than it used to (my lips actually got more chapped, it seemed, after using this all day, and even BLED a little from the dryness!) - This isn't nearly as creamy as it once was - I have to apply significantly more product for a color payoff (whereas when I used this exact shade before, it didn't take more than one light swipe)  This used to be a product that I could justify spending the $20+ dollars on every once in a while for a tube of fancy lip product, but now, it is definitely not worth the hefty price tag. Somehow Fresh made this product feel cheaper and overall much worse, while continuing to charge excessively for it.  It's unfortunate that because of its previous hype and previous genuinely great formula, people may not realize it is not nearly what it used to be.  Overall, 2 stars for the eventual color payoff of the Honey shade (it's pretty), and the same classic smell of this product that I love seeming to stay intact. But I feel like even 2 stars is a bit generous, due to the price tag of this.  Overall, try it for yourself if you must - for me, it ended up in a yep, everyone complaining about the new formula is absolutely correct and a quick return. There are way better options in this category, now."

I've always enjoyed how it moisturized my lips and gave it a warm pop of color so that I can skip the lipstick when in a rush.   With the new formula, I believe it is better in terms of color delivery: it's more sheer, which may be a negative for some, but I like that because it sort of enhances its quality as a lip balm and not full-on lipstick, which feels lightweight on my lips and appears more natural, especially for the darker colors I purchase. However, it doesn't have that same emollient effect as before. When I apply it, immediately, it's greatu2014moisturizing and smoothu2014but it makes my lips dry after 20 minutes or so, which requires constant re-application.   That's a bummer, especially as in previous years, one lip balm was able to last me a very long time. Compared to one year or two that I savored one lip balm with the previous formula, the most recent one I bought in plum lasted me six to seven months. That's still very long, but not like how it used to be.   Overall, it's great now for adding a sheer, natural flush of color to the lips, and for the lip balm feature itself, there are better ones. But, I'd exploit Sephora's return policy and still try it out."

Also it WILL NOT stick to my full lips, only the outermost parts that are never moistened from the inside of my mouth, if that makes sense. This is now a tinted balm that doesn't provide color or moisture, all yours for $24!    Here's a tip for using the new formula if you're stuck with it because you missed the window for returns like I did: Rub the stick on your fingertip first to warm it up, then apply the melted balm on your finger to your lips. Rubbing the stick directly on your lips will only result in pulled skin and disappointment."

I also love that itu2019s made with natural ingredients like beet root, sugar cane, and up-cycled cranberry seed oil. It left my lips so soft and hydrated feeling after just one use.

I do wish it contained SPF.  It feels wonderful on my lips.  It is not too thick and yet it is moisturizing.   As described it has a light buttery texture. It is not greasy feeling.  I love the color and that you can use it lightly or apply more layers for a deeper richer color.  My lips feel great immediately after using this product. It has the slightest faint sweet scent.

I recently restocked four of my staple colors not realizing that they had been reformulated. As a few others have commented, the new formula leaves a matte finish (previous formula was more shiny), feels dry on my lips  (previous formula felt creamy), is not moisturizing and starts wearing off in less than an hour (previous formula lasted for several hours). So basically, all the things I loved about these balms is gone. :-( I will not be repurchasing and will begin my search for a replacement that I hope I love as much as I did this one."

The shade is a lovely, natural, buildable mauve rosy with a hint of brown.

This new lip tint in plum has none of those problems - the consistency is way firmer, and for that reason it's way easier to get a consistent layer of pigment. The shade is also soo beautiful u2014 it's a sheer blackberry, and I could see it working for a whole range of skin tones. Same delicious fruity scent and same hydrating qualities as the old formula. Just a way better and more sophisticated consistency. This was gifted to me by Fresh."

The Fresh Beauty Sugar Lip Treatment in Papaya is good for when you want to moisturize your lips, keep them moisturized, and add a pop of color. The variation u201cPapayau201d definitely does not refer to a scent or taste, as I detect no fragrance or flavor when I wear this. Which is not a bad thing since that keeps me from constantly licking my lips or eating the product off. The shade to me looks more like an almost cherry red as opposed to an orange, which is the color I think of when I think of papaya. It applies with a medium sheen (not too glossy). If I do not reapply the lip treatment throughout the day, the sheen dries down to a pigmented stain. Another thing I enjoy about the sugar lip treatment is the overall presentation of the packaging. It is housed in a metal case that twists on instead of a case that you pop on and off. You can securely carry this in your pocket or handbag. No need to worry about the top coming off, and the product making a mess in your pocket or your purse."

The formula was apparently in the process of changing to remove the SPF, so itu2019s been hard to find in stores and online for the past few months as they cleared out the old product and brought in the new. I bought it in Bloom (my old favorite) and Papaya (a brand new color) as soon as I discovered it was back. (I tried to select Papaya to show in my review but the app is being weird! Itu2019s the color Iu2019m wearing in the second pic.)   So, the good news: the smell is still delightful, like vanilla-lemon? Iu2019ve never quite been able to put my finger on it! The colors are beautifulu2014Fresh doesnu2019t offer a huge selection, but my previous experience with almost all of the colors is that theyu2019re all very wearable, and many leave a lovely stain on your lips. The Papaya is BEAUTIFUL. Itu2019s a pretty coral pink, less intense than the actual Coral color that Sugar also comes in. The Bloom is also pretty, a subtle mauve-y pink, not as rosy as Rose. The formula swipes on smooth, not sticky, very easy to wear. The packaging (chunky tube with a twist off lid, matches the color of the balm) is still perfect.   And the bad news? Well, Iu2019ll miss the sunscreen. Since itu2019s the main thing Iu2019ve worn, I donu2019t have a good SPF alternative for my lips. They removed the shimmer from Bloom. It was so pretty with the shimmer! Pretty bummed about that. But the biggest thing is that I THINK they changed the formula to u201cstabilizeu201d the product. (Raise your hand if youu2019ve ever melted your Sugar in your hot car/pocket/purse!) I could be wrong about that, but given that it feels like it takes a lot more swipes to build up that buttery feeling Iu2019m used to, and then it still never quite achieves the same feeling, Iu2019m going to go out on a limb and say they changed it. Iu2019ll probably continue to buy it, but itu2019s just not quite the same."

The balm itself is more on the solid side, it is definitely not super balmy, but can still be applied to your lips just fine.

I used to wear this all the time during the day but Iu2019ll need to switch now, which is a bummer.

With one swipe I get a nice gentle flush of pink that just brings my lips to life and then when I build it up with a few layers it gets more intense while still letting my lips show through so it looks more effortless. The shade rose is perfect for when you want a flushed but still natural look. I love that the ingredients are clean and that the formula is hydrating and smoothing. It makes my lips look juicy and feel nourished. If I haven't been eating one application can last me a few hours without needing to reapply.

This color is great because you can build it up or down as much as you want, and it stays on for a decent amount of time without getting on my cups and straws like some other colored balms do!"

The scent is sweet and lovely without being too strong like a lot of rose-scented things so this made me love the product even more. The packaging is beautiful quality, heavy and nice feeling in the hand. As for the color, itu2019s so sheer and buildable which I really appreciate as someone who likes a more subtle lip. It has a soft pinky red u201cpopsicle stainedu201d look and feels more smooth and hydrating the more you apply. I would definitely try this in other shades! This product was gifted to me by Fresh."
