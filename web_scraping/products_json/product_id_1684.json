I just finished my bottle of this shampoo and my hair has grown more than it ever has before. Youu2019ll see the growth in my photo. I have been using this for just over 1 month and I am so impressed. Granted, I do other things such as scalp oiling and red light therapy every now and then, but Iu2019m sure in combination with this it all works better. The product smells lovely, like oranges. It lathers a LOT (my first impression was how impressed I was with the lather. For reference, I have coarse, dry, and curly hair naturally that I get chemically treated. Iu2019m repurchasing this. Canu2019t hurt to try it if youu2019re curious, but it worked for me to speed up my hair growth."

I love when companies can find a way to use a safe alternative! This is a wonderful conditioner especially paired with the shampoo! Gifted by GRO!"

I want to mention during this time and previous to this I was taking 2 scoops of collagen peptides and I have pcos.  The first two washes I noticed this left my hair feeling dry as if Iu2019ve been in the pool. I donu2019t use conditioner only leave in on my ends just find it works better than washing off conditioner. My scalp was itchy the next morning and developed some acne.  2nd week of using I found you have to really massage this in to your scalp where it emulsifies well and thoroughly wash it out in order for my scalp not break out or itch. I had a ton of hair fall out during this week like clumps of hair in the shower, while brushing, and the next morning.  This looked about 200-300 strands of hair I have medium length hair fine wavy hair. I was also showering every night as I did for my previous shampoo.   3rd & 4th week Iu2019ve been able to shower every other night rather than every night, scalp doesnu2019t get oily or flat. My 2B waves come naturally without lots of frizz, a tremendous amount of change to hair loss I only brush before showering and comb from back to front with a leave in conditioner which looks about 100 strands of hair after only brushing every other night. And about 10-50 strands of hair in the shower.   Iu2019m going to continue using this shampoo and will try out the hair oil next u2728"

Not to mention it smells like natural citrus which is absolutely AMAZING . Ive gotten so many compliments on how shiny my hair looks and how amazing it smells in the last few weeks. I like to massage it into my scalp for 60 seconds and then let it sit for another two minutes before rinsing for best results  Itu2019s also sustainable for all hair types and safe for color treated hair; is 100% vegan and cruelty free!"

I donu2019t notice a marked difference in the health of my hair yet and Iu2019ve been using for about six weeks. The product is very heavily perfumed, but smells delightful (bergamot, according to the website). I never noticed a difference when I massaged my scalp for 60 seconds vs. not so not sure if that really does anything. I have thin, fine hair and generally go three days between washes so I want a shampoo that can really clean. I didnu2019t always feel that this cut it and sometimes Iu2019d have to do a second shampoo or risk having oily hair. Overall, I liked the product, but Iu2019m not sure Iu2019d purchase again at the price point."

I have an oily her so it worked perfect for me but I wouldnu2019t recommend it for a dry scalp cause it will make it more dry but overall pricy and if you have a short or medium length, I believe you will get to see more results"

Maybe if you use it longer you will see better result. I definitely didnu2019t feel like my hair was silky soft, i had to use leave-in conditioners before hair styling.

Now that we got that out of the way, I donu2019t hate this shampoo, but I donu2019t think itu2019s right for my hair type either. When I used it, my hair fell very flat (it never felt heavy but it was clearly weighed down by how flat it fell). It also felt greasy by day 2 which isnu2019t usually the case for me. I tried it with leave in conditioner, without leave in, with foam volumizer, without it, etc., and nothing helped to give my hair more volume. Once I went back to my regular shampoo, my hair felt much cleaner and healthier. Again, I donu2019t think this was because this shampoo is terrible, I think itu2019s just not right for my hair type. Iu2019m also a sulfate girl, so put that into consideration when reading my review.   On the plus side, it did leave my hair with a beautiful shine (which may have been partially due to the conditioner as well), so I kind of hate that it didnu2019t work out for me. It smells great too (very citrusy), but if youu2019re not into strong scents, you might want to skip this one."

When i am out of the shower and my hair is drying/dried, the shampoo does not weight my curls down; it still gives me some volume which I like because I have thin and fine hair. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because while my hair looks voluminous, i donu2019t see a difference in length or density, and I donu2019t see a reduced amounts of shedding (it also may be because I have sample sizes and results donu2019t usually happen overnight). So overall, I recommend this shampoo because it left my hair shiny, soft, and didnu2019t mess up my curl pattern. I think this is something I would be willing to try in the full size to see if I get more benefits from the shampoo."

            "review_text": "I am new to Vegamour products. Due to some unusual hair loss Iu2019ve had over the past year, Iu2019ve noticed some thinning in my hair so Iu2019ve been trying a lot of hair care products that are new to me to help with that. Iu2019ve heard mixed reviews about the Vegamour shampoo and conditioning set but I decided to give the Vegamour GRO Revitalizing Shampoo & Conditioner for Thinning Hair & Hair Wellness a try.  The Vegamour GRO Revitalizing Shampoo & Conditioner for Thinning Hair & Hair Wellness comes in a pretty light pink easy to use squeeze bottle that looks great on the shelf and dispenses the products properly. The shampoo itself smells great and has a nice thick texture but spreads and lathers easily.  I noticed that the Vegamour GRO Revitalizing Shampoo is a little more drying than some of the other volumizing shampoos Iu2019ve tried but it works well for my hair. I wouldnu2019t use it more than once a week because of how drying it isu2026 for me, I think cleansing shampoo rules apply here. I didnu2019t notice a lot of differences but my hair did feel fuller and the shampoo helped with the oiliness of my hair.  Overall, I wasnu2019t upset about the Vegamour GRO Revitalizing Shampoo & Conditioner for Thinning Hair & Hair Wellness set. It works pretty well for me. I think that some of the people that are experiencing breakage or fallout might already have dry hair so the additional dryness from this shampoo just isnu2019t working for their hair type. I personally didnu2019t notice this in my experience but I also noticed how drying the product was for my hair and adapted my usage. I would cautiously recommend the Vegamour GRO Revitalizing Shampoo & Conditioner for Thinning Hair & Hair Wellness set to anyone fighting hair loss with oily hair keeping in mind that everyoneu2019s hair care needs are unique. It's a little pricey for a shampoo but it's in line with most shampoos for hair loss issues."

It doesnu2019t clutter or form clumps up like it did, less tangles and itu2019s not as dry as it was. The combo of Vegamour GRO seems to have done its work.

If youu2019re struggling with hair loss, want thicker hair, or just want long hair (like me) I would 100% recommend this shampoo. I use other products in my hair like I donu2019t use the vegamour oils or conditioners..but after seeing what Iu2019m seeing with just the shampoo, I honestly might get them too which Iu2019m sure Iu2019ll see quicker results. But I will say for those of you who are thinking about buying this and debating, please be patient. I know we want to see over night results but it does take time to really see a difference.

Also, Iu2019m reviewing this solely for its qualities as a shampoo and NOT speaking to its efficacy in hair growth and renewal. It may be helpful in that regard, but Iu2019m taking specific supplements and using an infrared growth and renewal cap so I canu2019t speak to which element gives me the greatest result. I lost hair by the handfuls when I had Covid and had a mishap lighting a gas fireplace where I burned off the front of my hair to the scalp from about the front of my hairline and back a couple of inches. (And my eyebrows and eyelashes too.) I had significant hair loss to recover from. Itu2019s been nearly two years, and Iu2019ve grown back most of my hair, and itu2019s actually thicker than it was before I had Covid.  Back to the Vegamour shampoo. It is simply the BEST shampoo that Iu2019ve EVER used. The texture of my hair is so silky and glossy after using it. It is volume boosting and so easy to style after using this shampoo. The lather is unbelievable. It takes a pea sized amount to get full lather on my hair, which is a chin length bob for volume reference. (My teenage daughter has incredibly thick curly long hair and only uses just a bit more than I do with each shampoo and gets amazing lather.) The fragrance is subtle, clean with no heavy artificial fragrance. Even my husband has commented on how amazing my hair look both after blowing out and when I let my hair dry with my natural wave with the Vegamour shampoo. Yes, itu2019s pricey, but a little goes a long way."

Honestly, im not incredibly impressed with this shampoo, mainly due to the face that the scent gives me an instant headache and lingers for days. Although it does cleanse the hair effectively and makes it appear a bit fuller after just one use due to the addition of panthenol in the ingredient list, I canu2019t attest to the effectiveness as far as hair growth goes simply because i cannot bear the strong fragrance (maybe the bergamot?) to use it on a regular basis. Iu2019m not usually sensitive to fragrance in beauty products, i actually lean more towards those that contain fragrance because i enjoy the sensorial experience, but this is a very natural incense-like scent thatu2019s just different. Itu2019s a shame because iu2019m trying to grow out my shoulder length impulse chopped hair and was really hoping to give this a run for itu2019s money. If you can bear the smell, the ingredients do sound quite promising and the fact that itu2019s vegan is a total plus! I personally will not be purchasing the full size, but donu2019t let my opinion deter you! Give it a whiff and if the scent profile appeals to you, by all means, go for it!

Though it has some nice benefits, the cons are quite substantial, mostly due to the essential oils that can really play a number on skin and actually irritate/dry it out. If you have sensitive skin, maybe sit this one out or use it sparingly.  I was able to make it work for me by viewing this as a treatment wash after cleansing and not depending on this product as an actual shampoo. I also highly encourage you to pair this with a very nourishing conditioner to avoid tangles or frizz, especially for those with fine/thin/brittle hair types.  It smells nice, adds shine, and it seems promising when used with their system. Iu2019m excited to see if any new hair growth comes in with this. So far, I think their serum is helping me the most."

I have not used this product long enough to comment on the growth aspect, but I look forward to updating my review after a month."

While it's still too early to tell the result of hair growth since it might take a couple of weeks but my hair  feels softer and cleaner.

I have an issue with pulling my hair out and this has definitely helped my hair look healthier. When I style my hair, my hair definitely looks fuller than when I didn't use this shampoo. But when I dont style, my hair is pretty flat. Maybe if this had a volumizer that would be perfect. But overall this is a great product and I plan on using this long term..

Iu2019ve been using vegamour for six months because my hair inexplicably dramatically slowed its growth and became very thin. I went to multiple doctors and had lots of tests done and thankfully, everything is fine, but we have no idea what is causing the hair issues. Out of desperation I tried this product. After two months I saw modest growth and a slow down of shedding. I paired the shampoo/conditioner with the serum. I ran out of serum a few months ago but continued to use the shampoo and still see the benefits and my hair had grown more the last six months than the entire last two years.   I pair the shampoo with a u201cscalpyu201d aka plastic tool that scratches your scalp and really makes it clean. (I got one from Amazon for about $6) My hair is soft and manageable after I use the shampoo. I also actually really like the smell.  Overall, im personally very happy with vegamour products because they seem to be working for me and they leave my hair cleaner and softer than before.   After some research it appears the serum is basically a concentrated form of caffeine and that the ordinarys hair serum, which is a fraction of the cost, is also caffeine so Iu2019m considering just using that serum instead of paying a lot more for vegamours.   Nevertheless I plan to continue using the shampoo/conditioner because at the very least it leaves my hair very clean, soft and manageable but also does actually seem to help with growth."

The only shampoos that have felt like they were cleaning my hair and helping the itchy scalp were medicated shampoos until this guy! My hair used to be super oily the next day, but with this I can go 2-3 days between washes. The biggest thing that sold me was that it stopped my itchy scalp!!! I donu2019t think I will ever use another shampoo, I love how clean my hair feels and how it has helped my scalp. Iu2019ve been using it for about a year (ordered from their site directly). Iu2019m excited Sephora has it since now I will be getting Beaty points with my purchases. I also noticed my hair falls out less, and my hair looks thicker. It does not over dry your hair like a lot of shampoos but I only use it on my scalp and tend to leave it on for about 5 minutes before washing it off. The price is a bit high but I really think itu2019s worth it."

After my first w weeks of use of The Vegamour GRO Shampoo I started noticing my hair felt sillier and fuller, I also noticed the baby hairs along my hairline looked fuller than usual.  By the end of my supply I compared my hairline, and length and - WOAH!!!! I Was Blown Away!!!! Not only did this amazing product repair the damage in my haur- it actually grew my hair!!!! My very fine baby hair became fuller began growing along my face! The baby hairs at the back of my hair line filled in drastically.  My hair overall felt softer, smoother, and shinier than I had ever seen it before!

However, it is a very gentle daily shampoo, making it a wrong choice for someone with an oily scalp (like me). It leaves the scalp oily and adds the buildup. I didn't see much of a difference in growth (that's what it is supposed to do). The only difference I noticed was my hairs are less frizzy.

It took a lot longer for me to need a wash than normal & I used little to no dry shampoo the whole time, because it does such a good job.   I got compliments on my hair when I used only the Vegamour products without my normal hair care routine. I wanted to see how my hair did without my normal routine, because my other products are enhancers for good hair.   However, I have thick hair & I didn't notice any more thickness, but I did notice more shedding which probably means it was stimulating new growth.

Overall, my hair is softer and when I use it, it doesnu2019t feel like it dries out my hair. My hair and scalp feel clean, and it effectively removes the grime of my workout without stripping it entirely. The scent is lovely as well. It smells of orange creamsicles! I have noticed while I used it, my scalp is more sensitive, but the hair that has been coming from my scalp is softer. I do use the hair oil as well, and eat the vitamin gummies. This could be the combination of all of them, but I think this is truly making a difference in my hair. I did receive this from Influenster to review for free, however, this review is my honest option."

I have color treated hair that is also thin and very coarse in texture. I have been in the past a hair model to show straightening techniques and was label the example for bad hair. I lost more after the birth of my son followed by diagnosis of hypothyroidism and PCOS. I have noticed new growth on two of my worst areas. The biggest thing though was how soft and silky it has made my hair. I have never had it this soft before even with salon treatments. I can't stop touching my hair! My only nitpicky issue is the price point. My industry was wrecked by Covid, available jobs in my area have terrible wages for the long hours they require. I know my friends are dealing with similar issues. I can't quite justify the cost in my budget right now even cutting more from it."

Was this shampoo the holy grail that turned my hair into something a Disney Princess would salivate over? No. But it definitely helped! And I would recommend it, along with the conditioner, serum, and gummy vitamins that are part of the Vegamour brand!   After using all the products together for a month my hair is definitely stronger and the split ends have tempered down a bit. It also left my hair feeling silky after the wash, although the frizz will have to be battled with another product. I only wash my hair 1-2 times per week and am excited to continue to use these products for the next month or so to see if things improve even further!   The shampoo has a great smell. And while scent is very personal, it reminded me of tangy strawberries. Light, refreshing, and NOT overpowering which is key. It also didn't linger too long on the hair so I didnt have to worry about how the scent would mix with my other perfumes.   The consistency was creamy and lathers like a dream! It also did not dull my color treated hair, which is awesome.  I would definitely recommend trying this out, although cannot speak to whether it works as a stand alone or you need the conditioner, serum, and vitamins as well.

In addition to the dryness, I wasn't a fan of the scent.  I imagined for the price it would smell a bit more luxurious instead of citrusy like grapefruit.  I haven't noticed any difference in thickness or fullness unless you count the dry frizz, and I don't think my hair grew any faster than normal. I love the packing because the tube is extra soft which made it easy to grip and deposit product with wet hands, but I also have some weakness in my hand which makes it difficult to squeeze hard, so this was helpful.  I imagine it would be great for anyone with arthritis.

And the conditioner smells the same but even better and much to my amazement did an incredible job of conditioning my incredibly long stringy hair. I thought the directions on the conditioner were crazy telling me to apply to my scalp and massage in cause again I have really naturally greasy hair but I did it anyway expecting to have to rewash the next day instead of every 48 hours like I usually do but I was pleasantly surprised that not only did it not make me an instant greaseball but I could have gone longer than 48 hours without rewashing if I wanted to.  I have very thin hair that with age (I am almost 39) has started to thin out and let me tell you thinning out with already thin hair is incredibly depressing. I have tried so many other hair care products claiming to help but nothing has so you can imagine how shocked I was that in one month of using the Vegamour GRO Revitalizing Shampoo, GRO Revitalizing Conditioner, GRO Hair Serum and eating the GRO Biotin Gummies I have noticed a HUGE difference, not only does my hair no longer look stringy and unhealthy but itu2019s incredibly obvious that it is more full. I am excited to see what continued use is gonna bring cause with what I am seeing in only one month I know itu2019s gonna be amazing. I regret so badly not taking before pics but like I said I have tried so many products claiming to boost growth and volume and never saw it so my expectations were not there. However I am taking pics now to show one month in and will take again after 3 months :).  So to sum it upu2026 IT WORKS AND I LOVE MY HAIR NOW!"

It must have left a film over the hole, because I couldn't seem to get the product to come out. I finally stuck something in the hole, and opened it up. It came out much more freely after doing this. After my shower, I took the shampoo, as well as the conditioner, and placed them on my dresser in my bedroom, as I didn't want my children to waste them. I noticed the next day that the shampoo had somehow leaked out of the cap, and ran all down my dresser. This is the reason for my 3 stars.  The shampoo itself is good, the packaging needs improvement."

However, I found that when I used the shampoo and conditioner together my hair would get a bit oily at the roots. Also I noticed it was frizzier thatu2019s normal. I started using the shampoo with a different conditioner or the conditioner with a different shampoo and that helped. My hair is fairly thick to begin with, so I think someone with thinner hair would benefit more from this product. I donu2019t think I would recommend it to anyone with oily hair.

So I will tell you what I can   The smell: itu2019s delish.  Itu2019s a light candy orange scent.  Almost reminds me of a scent a very popular bathbomb company carries in the winter as a body wash.   I love it.  I constantly sniff my hair.     It lathers well and only a small amount needed to obtain a great lather.    It cleans well.  My hair feels clean after I rinse and doesnu2019t feel like a residue is left behind.   The negatives.   My hair is VERY tangly.    Itu2019s seemed quite dry since switching from Pureology to this.     Hair growth: Iu2019ve not seen any yet.  But itu2019s only been 3 weeks. I feel with this type of product, a review really needs a good 60-90 days worth of product use to provide an accurate opinion based on experience.     I will continue to use this product and I have high hopes in this product line.  The ingredients are great and I trust in the company itself.

Needed to use way more than the recommend amount of product so I donu2019t feel this would last long (hair is past shoulders).  Hair desperately needed conditioner after use. This is not a shampoo you can just use and not follow up with a really nice conditioning product. I donu2019t feel it helped with hair shedding/loss. Felt I had more loss in my hair brush and in shower. Also felt it left my hair brassy (I have double process platinum locks). The shampoo along with the conditioner did make my hair more shiny. Hair also did seem to have more volume, but made hair frizzy. Over all Iu2019d give it 2 stars just for the shine and scent."

Used with Gro Revitalizing Conditioner, Gro biotin gummies and Gro scalp detoxifying hair treatment serum. I have been using it for over 3 weeks now. I was really excited to receive this product as I have very thin type 1a hair and due to a chronic health problem can lose it more than I'd like. Plus I tend to lose more hair when stressed and this has been a really stressful year. If you are sensitive to fragrance, this isn't for you. I'm sensitive to fragrance and when the box first arrived it triggered my asthma a bit and I was worried I wouldn't be able to use it. I have gotten used to it, but the scent is still really strong enough to make me seriously wonder whether I'd purchase it. It smells amazing, like oranges, but it's just too much. The packaging is a really nice pink and gold, looks really high end. This foams really well for a clean shampoo but I have oily roots from seborrheic dermatitis and the hard water in my area is a 100/100 on the scale. This doesn't clean enough so I have to use with my usual shampoo. The vegan silk is really good, feels just like regular silk so impressed with that. I do think this makes my hair thicker when I use it with the conditioner, but if I stop using it doesn't last. I haven't noticed any difference in the amount of hair I'm losing or anything looking fuller (I feel like anything different is more how I parted my hair than the product), but I have more product left and plan to finish this and see if it works. If it does I'll update my review, but instead of purchasing this I'd probably look to the Gro serum and wash it out, even though it's a leave in, to get around the strong fragrance issue."

I will be buying these products again when I get close to running out. They are a little pricey, but with the small amount that you use I feel like it is worth it. The overall experience while using this product it worth it alone. I feel really relaxed and pampered when I use the products. The whole aromatherapy experience combined with the instructions they give, really makes the experience amazing. I can smell this product on my hair throughout the entire day.

However, I have thick kinky-coily type 4 hair, and the price for this product being around $48 for 8 ounces is really expensive when there are other products that are just as clean/without sulfates on the market. This product may not be accessible for the average consumer."

The consistency is good, not too thick not too runny. It looks like a clear gel. Has a strong smell of tangerines but it doesnu2019t linger. I do like the smell a lot but if you are sensitive to smells, that may be a problem.  My hair is thick, wavy, dry and frizzy. I have been using the shampoo for at least 3 weeks already and my hair looks healthy with less frizz. I do have to wash my hair more often, I assume that the shampoo is not stripping my hair of the natural oils and that is the reason.  I do recommend the shampoo, the only negative thing is the price tag."

It honestly kind of smells like gummy bears to me but I donu2019t mind the sweet smell. I also really enjoyed the minimal packing as it looks cute in my shower. I can not tell if it made a real difference in my hair as far as thickness. I already have semi thick hair. It is kind of pricey so I am not sure if I would personally repurchase this."

Made my hair silky soft, shiny, and tamed down my frizz and wave an not to mention my hair smelled delicious. It says it smells like gummy bears which it does but way better lol.  The only reason i gave 4 stars was cause it says color safe which it faded my hair so quick, i just dyed my hair (bright red) a few days before receiving, and now I'm light pink an you can see some blonde showing. Other then that my hair has never felt this amazing, nice looking an smelling delicious. I will continue using to see if my hair gets fuller, but i could tell my hair grew faster cause i already need my roots touched up."

I will say be careful when opening the bottle (make sure itu2019s right side up) as the formula is thinner than most shampoos.
