Also, you can definitely build this up for the colour to appear more vibrant.

As someone who loves eyeshadow looks that are effortless and refined, I really like this cream shadow. I bought the shade Midcentury and I plan on picking up more; I use it as a base for the easiest 2-3 step eye look ever.  With the product on my finger tip, I concentrate it on my eyelid starting in the outer corner and working my way in, then feather it out into my crease and tap it out with the remaining product. They blend so easily, it hardly takes any work.  I layer any shimmer shadow over it that Iu2019m feeling that day, itu2019s so versatile and allows me to switch up my daily look without switching up my routine and taking more time to get ready in the morning.  Itu2019s also SUPER long wearing. I used to never wear eyeshadow to work because it took forever to blend everything out and wouldnu2019t last through the entire shift, but this allows me to have a finished eyeshadow look in less than five minutes that lasts all day long, Iu2019m talking 12+ hours.  Hereu2019s my only gripe, and itu2019s a small one but I have a hunch it may affect the shelf life of the product: since it sets so quickly from a cream to a powder finish, it also dries up pretty quickly in the pot. It leaves little crumblies behind and Iu2019m worried that as I use the product more and it gets more exposure to air, the texture will change and I wonu2019t be able to get through the whole pot without it drying up. This isnu2019t a real problem that Iu2019ve encountered yet, but I wanted to throw it in here.  I also canu2019t use this product with my fan on because it will dry on my finger before I can blend it out fully and get patchy, so I turn my fan off when Iu2019m applying this, but thatu2019s also the case with most of my eye makeup like my mascara and eyeliner so thatu2019s not that big a deal."

I apply it in awing then blend inward for an easy graduated wash and then pick up a tiny bit on a brush and use it as a liner on the outer 1/4 corners bottom and top the. blend. The jar is fairly large and I expect it to easily last two years. The formula is unscented and cruelty-free and seems sensitive skin friendly so far. I might even try the plum color.

I'm SO happy with this product. you can use the thinnest amount and sheer it out for a subtle wash... and somehow it is perfectly blended every time. You can also build it as much as you want and it magically blends.   Caution: I have light skin with yellow undertones (Kosas concealer 2W or 2.3) and this eye shadow shade in Studio is flaming PEACH on me. No taupe in sight. its not cool either -- it's a warmish-neutral peachy beige.  I with Merit would make some muddier nuanced neutrals. So now I'm buying Nelson the grey one to hopefully achieve a taupe by mixing the tones.   ZERO CREASING, ZERO TEXTURE on my aging greasy eyes. Although you can see some texture in my photo. This is because I found that if I build up multiple light layers it will show more texture. Where as if I just apply what I need from the get-go, it dries down with no texture.   Life-changing formula!"

Just a terrible, terrible formula that's so badly executed.  I know what they're going for, but this is not it.  I recommend Bobbi Brown's single eyeshadows if you're still trying to achieve that matte, subtly smoky 90s shadow look.  I rarely write reviews, but this product is so bad that it's shocking."

I tried out Nelson and it was such a soft yet edgy gray color but when I tried to apply it it was rock hard and what I was able to scrape off, it applied so patchy. This product might work for those who wear eyeshadow often and finish the product quickly but for an occasional wearer, try either the Armani or Ilia."

It's natural and has a hint of red that will make your blue or green eyes pop! It's also a great base color for those who say,  I want to look  natural and just got out of bed looking like this days. It can even ward off discoloration from your lid, which, as you get older, can have a green/bluish tint. Remember, girls, Red tones counter any ash and green.

For best results, understand the formula. I use the dense Merit eyeshadow brush. (The bristles are a little stiffer than for a powder eyeshadow.) Soft brushes do not work as well. Let the eyeshadow set for a minute before building layers or else patchiness can occur. These are very similar to MAC Pots, but not as robust, and easier to feather. You might need to wash your brush more often with this shadow, but I prefer the no budge formula. Finally, my eyelids are oily, but I haven't experienced creasing unlike others mention, so YMMV."

I will say however, that Vachetta did not show up at all on my light/medium skin (eyelids might be a bit darker) but midcentury is so beautiful-the loveliest warm brown. I also have Social and was hoping it would blend to a light purple/lavender but on my warm skin, it looks more like a grey/taupe colour.  Worth it if you're happy with a simple wash of colour. I bought the brush with this and it works well with these but isn't necessary"

I was so excited for these and purchased several colors but I am returning all."

It is creamy, easty to apply, buildable (had to add a bit more to get the payoff I wanted) and is very comfortable. Seems to wear well. Feels interesting because it doesn't dry to a powder....stays creamy feeling on lids. This is a very warm brown shade....once built up, the tone looks deeper on my fair skin than on the fair skinned model in the photos. Took me a minute to figure out how to get the cap off....then to close it you have to force it til you hear a click....I guess this is to prevent product from drying out. Definitely will go back for another shade. Took 1 star off for price as I believe this product could be priced lower (seems like a shallow pan...most of weight seems to be packaging, which is elevated looking). My first foray into Merit was successful. Thank you Sephora!"

They are simply gorgeous, and I have not tried the darkest shades, but I have almost all of the lighter ones, and they each look so beautiful and seem almost like a natural-esque contour for my eyes.......they just so beautifully enhance them (I am a light-medium neutral in foundation colors.......leaning more cool than neutral........with dark brown eyes and super dark brown hair). The only downside and the reason why I've rated this much lower than I would normally have is that you have to work lightening quick with this product or it dries down and you are unable to move it around at all unless you wait a good 30 minutes or so until your eyelids heat up and make application more pliable again, and then it becomes patchy at best. It is THAT EXTREMELY difficult to apply, but if you are working at the speed of sound and are able to blend your heart out and really work this product in you will be rewarded with one of the most satisfying makeup products I have come across in years. This really is a Sophie's choice situation for me people, but I have to be honest and state that yes, if you have drier lids this may not work for you, and if you want to add layers of shadows this may not work for you, but something I really wish to emphasize is that nobody seems to give vachetta a real shot.............try it..............you will be rewarded. Especially if you are my skin tone........Vachetta becomes the most gorgeous no makeup look that makes me look polished, and I apply it all over, and I would have NEVER gone near this color except that it was the only one they had available in store, and once I tried this I went in deep and tested the other shades and purchased Midcentury, Burn, and Social.................and Social is another chef's kiss color...........you need to try these, but be aware of how difficult they are to use."

You can not build, the color gets even more patchy with bald spot galore. The darker shades are beyond horrible.   The other two I have (Midcentury and Social) are manageable. Up close, they are absolutely still patchy, but being lighter shades, it isnu2019t as noticeable. These also enhance texture. If you have maturing lids, avoid. They dry so fast that you have no working time. That caused the product to dry on your brush or finger which is partially the cause of them getting patchy. The dry product on your lid lifts up on the dry stuff on your brush or fingers. I can not overstate how bad these are.  The only nice thing I have to say about them is that I like the three colors I have. Thatu2019s it."

I've had my eyes on Viper for a while, as it was consistently sold out in stores. I bit the bullet and ordered it online during the VIB Rouge sale period. Unfortunately, this shade's not working like Brun - it's patchy, and doesn't seem to blend or layer as effortlessly.

I applied it with my fingers and it went on smooth and I could easily diffuse it with my fingers alone. The product on its own did crease and move a bit after around 5 hours. However when I tried it again using an eyeshadow primer (Milani eyeshadow primer) I got nearly 8 hours of wear.   I had some issues with building up the colour of the product at first. And found that I needed to have it fully dry down before adding another layer or it would get patchy.

I'm not sure where the mixed reviews are coming from, maybe different colors are affecting the formula but I had no issues with creasing or patchiness, it's just a beautiful cream formula that doesn't dry down too fast, some creams dry so fast you can't blend them out, this one isn't like that.. but once it does dry that baby don't budge all day.

I finally decided to pick this up on the shade Social during the sale and I love it! I donu2019t wear a lot of eyeshadow and if I do, itu2019s often a very simple look. This is such a great product for people who like a quick and easy shadow look to give the eyes some definition. Iu2019ve heard the darker shades can be patchy, but I had no issues with Social. Itu2019s much more wearable in person and less pink than it looks in the photos, and works great on my fair cool skin tone. I apply it with my fingers and then blend it with a brush. I find I have plenty of time to work with it before it dries down. I also didnu2019t have any issues with creasing. Totally going to pick up the shade Studio when itu2019s back in stock!

The formula is not user friendly - it dries down super quickly and if you try to blend after it's dried, it gets super patchy and uneven. It's impossible to fix once this happens so you have to take it off and start over. I've tried this with and without shadow primer to no avail. You have so little time to blend and create shadow/shape before the product dries that it feels like it's meant for either an extremely imperfect/grunge/smudgy look or someone who works really really quickly. It also clumps on eyeshadow brushes making blending even harder. I purchased the new Merit eyeshadow brush just to use it with this, and even that brush clumps with this eyeshadow.   Giving it 3 stars - packaging is nice, the shades are stunning, and the price is ok for the amount of product, but the formula is just not great and it doesn't feel luxurious or innovative."

I don't use a primer because I found that with a primer the shadows are too grippy and consequently dry patchy. Even without primer they last all day with no creasing and no color loss!  The formula is not very buildable and doesn't get much darker with additional layers. But it can be easily layered with other Merit or powder shadows on top. I've used the Brun color to add depth to Social and as a soft eyeliner.  These shadows are gorgeous, creamy, smooth and very matte. They are truly lovely to use.

It also has a somewhat dark base, so ends up being rather smokey/dramatic for daytime/work wear for me. That being said the color is unique enough in a cream formula AND I do find that it lasts well on me that I'm willing to fuss with it to blend it out and deal with the patchiness. Just be aware not all of these perform the same or are similarly fool proof! With the varied reviews I can't help wondering if then same variability is present in longevity, but I've had good luck with both Social and Viper regarding longevity."

With a eyeshadow primer, a comment on Instagram suggested putting their minimalist on your lids first then the eye shadow, didn't work for me, still creased. I put it on very thinly, still creases.

However, people whose opinion I respect have been falling over themselves for this eyeshadow, and it looks bad even as they are applying it right in front of my eyeballs while extolling its virtues. Half of the model photos on THIS PAGE look terrible. It's dry, patchy, I can't figure out how to get it to cover smoothly or evenly or blend out into anything other than a bruised look. Not to mention that this color is not taupe by anyone's definition. Get a Paint Pot, or even a Revlon pot."

Also I would skip the color Studio because it shows peachy tone on my lids as expected and not as described. The lasting power is great on my dry skin and works well with liquid eyeliner so I didnu2019t see any issue.

I did use my fingers, but I always use my fingers. it was a no for me. I just couldn't get it to work. The packaging is lovely and I love how there is a click on the jar to make sure it is air tight."

I can't say I have ever been great at applying makeup, and because of this, I tend to go for more natural looks with as minimal makeup as possible, especially excluding eyeshadow.   - After trying the Solo Shadow for about 2 weeks, I definitely can recommend this eyeshadow! It was so easy to put on, even I couldn't even mess it up! I dabbed it with my ring finger on casual days over my lid only, since I have pretty hooded eyes. On date night I blended it out with Brush No. 2 for a more pigmented look and used the precise end to line my bottom lash line!   - It dried down so quickly, was petal soft to the touch, and hadn't moved for the hours I wore it. It came off effortlessly with my double-cleanse routine. I used a bit of Merit's Day Glow in Cava on the center of my lid to finish the look! Truly adding to the entire 5-minute makeup. It is so effortless I can do my makeup in the car!  This will definitely live in my collection! Thanks, Merit Team!! u2661"

The mauve/purple color seem to go away even if I pack on more, and so I'm left with a very subtle mauve (much unlike the photos of this shade) that is much closer to Studio but with a tinge of mauve/purple.

Here are the issues. 1. The shadow dries down VERY quickly so youu2019ll need to do one eye at a time and make sure that where you want your shadow is where you really want it.  2. You cannot layer these shadows. I wanted to use viper in my crease and to darken my right corner but guess what happens when you do that? It creases.  As a side note, I did purchase the new merit brush."

            "review_text": "Iu2019ve used social and brun for about a week now. I ended up keeping social because the colour was easier to blend out on my fair skin. I really wanted to like brun for a liner and occasional smoky eye, but these shadows are a bit tricky for fair skin. Firstly, the shades run sooooo warm. I really hope merit can introduce some truly cool or at least neutral shades in the future. Even social, which is one of the cooler shades in the range, can run a rosy brown (reminiscent of a pink eye infection) if I apply a light layer with the brush. Instead, I use my finger to apply a generous amount and that seems to help with the colour pay off. The key here is using a generous amount, otherwise, as was the case with brun, it will dry quickly and go patchy. I suppose because the contrast between light skin and dark brown shadow was so strong, I couldnu2019t use the large amount either with a finger or a brush. With my finger I could blend out a little bit and it would be fine. But it creases, for sure. I donu2019t know if I have some sort of unusually oily eyelids, but these crease on me and they crease quickly. I donu2019t mind with social because it doesnu2019t contrast with my natural skin colour as much, but when a thin diffused layer of brun creases on me it would just emphasize fine lines I didnu2019t know I had on my eyelids. It also was far too warm for my liking to use even as a gel eyeliner substitute. Applying brun with the brush was super patchy on my light skin, again because I had to use smaller amounts of product to not go too dark, and therefore it would dry super quickly.  With that being said, the brush is fine, I will keep it cause I donu2019t have many brushes but I wouldnu2019t bother if you own others. Like I said, for me I found these to work best with your fingers regardless, the small side is fine but there are better options. My small side is a little bit uneven and not the best eyeliner/shadow brush Iu2019ve ever seen. Also the handle of the brush is an inch too short for comfort."

Iu2019ve tried most items in their range, and Iu2019ve purchased the foundation stick many, many times over. Iu2019m also a single shadow kind of person, so this seemed like an easy home run. Sadly it misses the mark.   (1) Formulau2014 itu2019s creamy while applying, but it once it dries down it looks patchy and very, very dry. I saw lines on my face I didnu2019t know existed. I do not have this issue with shadows of any type, ever. It was an unflattering, uneven mess whether applied with the Merit brush or my fingers. I would not dream of using this as anything other than a liner, and even then, there are way better products.   (2) Color rangeu2014the color choices look extremely unflattering on some fairer skin tones, including the models in their ads. Based on Instagram swatches and reviews, it seems safe to say there is a large chunk of the population for whom the color range is not a safe bet. They need a few more neutral choices on both the fairer and deeper spectrum to suite all skin tones. These are not universal like they want you to believe.   (3) Merit did not invent the one and done shadow or the pot/cream shadow. Despite their strong insistence that theyu2019re innovating eyeshadow with this, theyu2019re not. Plenty of brands have released pot shadows in the last 25 years and my makeup drawer proves it. Merit, where have you been?   Also, do not let Merit gaslight you into thinking that eyeshadow palettes are just too u201ccomplicatedu201d for you. Youu2019re smart and capableu2014-you can handle the palette if you want it. Iu2019m all for single shadows, but please, Merit, drop the condescensionu2026.we know how to apply eyeshadow.   (4) The packaging is cheap. Like toy plastic feeling cheap. I expected more.   I hope this is a one off miss for the brand! Iu2019m the meantime, I plan to stick with my other singles."

This creamy eyeshadow delivers more than just a matte finish u2013 it presents a statement that is both bold and sophisticated. From the moment I applied this eyeshadow, I was blown away by its remarkable pigmentation. A little goes a long way, and the color payoff is truly outstanding. And another standout features of this eyeshadow is its impeccable longevity. I found that once applied, it stays firmly in place throughout the day, without losing its vibrancy or fading over time. Even in the face of daily activities, the color maintains its integrity until you decide to remove it. Speaking of removal, I was pleasantly surprised by how easily the eyeshadow comes off with makeup remover, providing a hassle-free experience at the end of the day. So if youu2019re looking for something that has a creamy texture, remarkable pigmentation, and enduring matte effect make these a must-have addition to your makeup collection. With this product, Merit has unquestionably raised the bar for quality eyeshadows, and Iu2019m excited to continue exploring their range of offerings in the future."

If you have dry eyelids I doubt that will be as much as an is of an issue. I found the product really easy to blend out and pack on to build intensity. I don't really love the component. It feels a little cheap. It is plastic and not weighted."

The formula is easy to blend out and build to your satisfaction, but once it has dried down and set, surprisingly it stays put rather well and can't be rubbed off easily. I was quite impressed how well it stay put because a lot of cream shadows I've used in the past, can easily be rubbed off or the oil on my lids breaks them down by mid morning. The formula of these are hydrating and easy to work with no matter your skill level. It's easy to blend out; you never have to worry about going overboard and your eye look resulting with racoon eyes. These are perfect for creating one shade eye looks or I imagine could be combined with other shades as well."

Luckily, the innovation of this formula allows it to not to transfer! This formula is unique because it applies and glides easily with both brushers and fingers with a customizable pigment pay off.

The lasting power is really good! I almost always get creases in normal shadows, but this felt like it almost blended into my skin, not showing creases. I also really like the shade Vachetta.

First impression, the packaging is sleek and minimalist yet gives a luxurious feel with the gold lid that locks into place, which enables the product not to dry out.   The shade viper is a soft matte warm green shade that'll complement all skin tones after swatching the shade onto my lids. it's not bright and cool, making it the perfect green wearable shade for the daytime for an evening out.  Application is super easy. You can use MERIT superior quality brush Brush No. 2 a dual ended brush to diffuse color across the lid or the tapered end to apply shadow along the lash line. I'm happy to say that solo shadow applies easily with the finger. all you need is one swipe and pat down into the lid and crease area. I've noticed that it's completely safe to use in the waterline area without irritation. But if you have very sensitive eye refrain from it.   I can appreciate how the formula is buildable, doesn't settle into crease or texture, has a cream-to-powder finish,  is budge free, and will seriously last the entire day. Just blend shadow out quickly it dries down beautifully. Once eyeshadow is in place, it doesn't crease or crack.  don't forget to use an eyeshadow Primer that works for you.   Solo shadow is formulated with super clean and good for the skin ingredients."

I learned that the hard way, as this was my first cream to shadow formula.  But i must say once it dries down, it stays and wonu2019t budge! Tried to smear it with my hands, and it stays on.  The color I chose was Viper Green but when its on my eyes, it was more grey than it is green. Maybe thatu2019s just my skin tone."

The buildable, formula creates a subtle color that's perfect for everyday wear. I used Brush No. 2 to apply it, and it applied effortlessly.

You know that Latte look thatu2019s been going around lately? THIS eyeshadow shade is it and it is perfect for my skin tone! This is creamy when you first apply it but it does dry down fast so you do have to work pretty quickly. If you donu2019t, it will look patchy. Thatu2019s why I docked a star because it does need a good technique. Also, this lasts ALL day. The picture I provided was after a long errand day in the heat and building furnitures.   This is how I apply the eyeshadow: I lay down the initial pigment on my lids first and then I buff out upwards towards the crease. Afterwards I add a little more on the outer v and the lower lashline! I love this look so much. Itu2019s soooo simple but looks like I did a ton of work haha."

I also don't think it's buildable, because the more I tried to apply/blend, the patchier it would get and the more it would pill. I tried using both my finger and the Brush No. 2, neither of which helped. I also tried applying the shadow on top of my bare lid and with eyeshadow primer. The primer helped remove the pilling, but didn't get rid of the patchiness. I also tried warming it up on my finger, but it was still really hard to make it look good. I would say this eyeshadow is like a cream, compressed eyeshadow. You really only need a little bit to get a lot of color. Despite the application, the packaging of this eyeshadow is very classy. Maybe I just got a bad batch."

It does't not leave any residue. Viper is a great shade for a person with olive skin like me and dark or light brown eyes. I love that I can create many different looks with the dual tip brush. Only reason I do not give it 5 stars is because it's a little hard to apply over your lids as it tugs a bit, I'd suggest using a creamy primer or some sort of moisturizer before applying, or using a doe foot brush with a tapping motion. It works perfectly as an eyeliner but not so much so as a creamy eyeshadow. On a positive note it does last all day for that same reason! Won't smudge or crease."

I love it because itu2019s not as harsh as black would be and I think a little more interesting to look at than brown.
