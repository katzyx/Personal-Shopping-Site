Once I took them out and the bumps started to disappear. I thought this would be an easy, hygienic way to apply toner! I thought it would keep my skin smooth and give it a wonderful shine! Boy was I wrong! I stocked up thinking the comments about other people getting bumps was a one off or due to something else! Boy was I wrong. Now I have three containers of these that Im scared to even gift.   Beware: even if you dont have acne prone skin, even if you dont usually have reactions to skincare, even if you have used 10 different toners beforeu2026.these pads can cause textured bumpy skin.

I first cleanse my face, then I wipe my entire face, neck, chest and other areas with these pads and then I'll either use my retinol after on my face,neck & chest and then I apply another glycolic body lotion all over my legs & arms. The results are unreal! It's like I'm giving myself peels at home but without the high costs, plus I'm not getting crazy peeling, just brighter, lighter, smooth beautiful skin. Trust me, these work! I take excellent care of my skin with good serums/skincare products/retinol, microneedling, light peels etc. This product is an added plus that I keep on hand especially when summer is over and I know I'm done with getting anymore sun on my body!

The pads are super saturated, so I also use it on my neck, chest, and elbows. They're really good in the winter because it's so hydrating but also great in the summer because it's so gentle.

That's how I was using them back in 2018 and I used them every day - I wasn't using SPF every day though and I actually developed a skin cancer lesion (basal cell carcinoma). I'm NOT blaming this product for my skin cancer, but I also don't think it's a coincidence that it showed up at around the time I was going really hard on these during my daytime routine and not using SPF. You live and you learn - it's not a critique of the product but I hope folks reading the reviews will see this and decide to use this product in their evening routines + follow with a good sunscreen in the morning! This goes for any AHA-containing or exfoliating product because they make your skin more UV sensitive!"

I had to put the rest of the pads in a ziplock baggie so the pads wouldnt dry out. I have sensitive, adult acne prone skin but ever since I started using the right products, I rarely experience acne anymore. I only get a zit every other menstrual period I have. I use Andalous kombucha cleanser, Paulas Choice clear moisturizer (look for promo codes to get free shipping and a discount on their website). My staple face masks are the MUACs pumpkin face mask with glycolic acid and The Ordinarys peel mask. My skin has already been purged long ago. I used one of these wipes all over my face and neck and the next day I woke up with a few red zits, white heads and black heads all around my t-zone. It has been 1 week since I used the pad and my skin is still trying to recover. I get this exact reaction from other pore clogging products. If you have acne prone skin STEER CLEAR!!! I dont know that caused the acne in this product but something did. Instead, I recommend The Ordinary peel mask and MUACs pumpkin facial mask for acid exfoliation. The pumpkin mask smells like pumpkin pie and you only leave it on for 5 minutes!! Its gentle but still lacks a punch for exfoliation and clearing pores. I use the pumpkin mask once a week every 3 days. The Ordinary peel is stronger, I use it once a week and I leave it on for less than 9 minutes. If I did not use the pumpkin mask, I would use The Ordinary peel twice a week. I do think the pumpkin mask packs more of a punch than the T.O. Peel though, in my experience. If you have sensitive skin you do not have to leave The Ordinary peel mask on for an entire 9-10 minutes. Everybodys skin is different. The drier your skin is, the less time you should leave the T.O. Peel mask on. Even if you can only stand to leave it on for 3-5 minutes, thats still enough exfoliation."

My skin has been dry, extremely sensitive, oily, & now normal-to-dry, & the @firstaidbeauty pads completely transformed my skin. Since it had been a few years since I last used the toner/ exfoliation pads, I decided I would test these for 3 + weeks before reviewing.  First off, lets cover what makes the Facial Radiance Pads so magical. They contain both Lactic + Glycolic Acids to gently (but deeply) exfoliate, brighten, & tone the skin. Formulation includes both Indian Gooseberry + Cucumber to tone, while Lemon Peel + Licorice Root brighten skins appearance & invoke a beautiful glow. All skin types can use these, even sensitive skin! This #firstaidbeauty product is vegan, gluten-free, cruelty-free, clean, & non-comedogenic.  After 3.5 weeks Ive noticed: * Smaller pore size/ less noticeable pores * Textured areas are smoother * Small scars + old acne marks are starting to fade * Skin tone is more even & bright * Radiant, healthy glow. Dullness where??!! * Makeup applies much easier & more evenly * Redness has been reduced * Clears up current acne + ingrown hairs so they resolve faster  OBSESSED. Im obsessed with these Facial Radiance Pads all over again! I will purchase these when I run out because I love the benefits I get from them & like that I can use it as a toner + exfoliator in one. Plus, I am dying to get the Limited Edition tub of pads! At nighttime I use 1/2 or a whole pad on my face, neck, & decollete after cleansing (the FAB Pure Skin Face Cleanser is perfect for this step!), then let it dry down for 5-10 minutes. Afterwards, I pat in a thicker toner or essence with my hands, & follow it up with my serum(s), eye cream, + moisturizer. If the results Ive seen in the last ~4 weeks are any indication, then Im up for DRAMATIC results in 6 months. I cant wait to see!"

My face was noticeably more radiant and glowing after use. Does everything is claims to do. Your skin is radiant, and these pads provide the right amount of exfoliation when you use them at least twice a day. I highly recommend theses high quality pads for your face.

I got this, the Saturday Skin toner (with 10% glycoclic acid) and The Ordinary 20% Glycolic Acid.   So overall, my pores did improve A LOT (sorry forgot to take before picture so can't show the difference),  The Saturday skin toner was too strong, I used it maybe 3-4 times a week, this however, it makes my skin  feels so smooth (I think it's the lactic acid in it) and I can use it everyday, twice a day.   One star is taken off for the waste though.  I'm quite concerned about environmental impact of tossing a couple of these pads off a day as I'm trying to minimize waste (hence the one star off).  So I will still try to seek alternative toner/exfoliater to find one with similar ingredients before coming back to this."

Instead of improving skins texture like it claims, my pores were more noticeable than before and my serum would not apply evenly as a result. Im not a skincare specialist but I would think the AHAs in these pads produce a drying effect and over time, they have an opposite effect to what was intended.

I also have very sensitive skin and it was great for me. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!"

My only complaint would be that it is a bit overpriced for the amount of product you get (i.e. if they just sold this as a serum and used cotton pads with it, it would probably be better value for your dollar). Other than that, FAB can do no wrong and the majority of their products are above average, and active-ingredient driven."

My cheekbones are no longer scaly to the touch and my skin has such a gorgeous glow to it! I have noticed that my redness that came alongside my irritation is starting to fade as well!  I use them every other night and it has done wonders for me! If their other products are equally as good as their radiance pads, I'm looking forward to trying more from them!"

I don't think I have many holy grail products, but this is DEFINITELY one of them. Someone else mentioned you can cut each pad into 2, which is exactly what I do. There's plenty of product in half of each pad and I use them morning and night religiously. If these were ever discontinued, I would be devastated."

I got these in the All That FAB Kit and have been using them for about 5-6 days.  Since I started using this plus the ultra repair cream, my skin looks and feels AMAZING. I am fair-skinned and have freckles/maybe some beginner age spots and since using these my age spots have diminished and my skin looks incredibly youthful and bright. I just can't believe how quickly I saw and felt a difference from this product. As someone with sensitive/dry skin, I can say that most FAB products have been life-savers for me, but this one just might be my favourite. I look and feel 3-4 years younger (TRUST ME) The best.

My pores are noticeably much smaller in appearance and therefore do not get nearly as clogged as before so I have been able to reduce my picking almost entirely. My skin looks so much clearer and brighter its almost like a miracle. I was initially a bit weary of purchasing this product because it is a bit pricy for everyday use however the pads are moist enough that you can actually use them more than once before discarding (I have been using each one twice). After the first use just squish the pad back down on to the stack of pads and it will re-moisten. This helps make them more affordable however they are well worth the price anyway in my opinion. I am beyond happy with this product and will most definitely repurchase again and again and again."

I like using these as a first step in my skincare routine in the morning underneath makeup. I guess it would really depend on what your skin type is, but during summer months, I use one almost every day so considering that, it's not that cost efficient. I've tried neogen, and cosrx exfoliating pads, and personally, cosrx's moisture up pads worked better for my skin, and is half of the price of this for 70 sheets. Sucks sephora doesn't carry them.

I use one pad in the morning followed by the Drunk Elephant C-Firma vitamin C treatment (does cause slight stinging) which has overall drastically transformed by skin. My complexion is brighter, clearer, and more hydrated throughout the day and I experience a noticeable glow using the two products together. Some may say not to use acids with vitamin C, but as long as the PH levels align, they are a safe and effective combo. Other users cut these pads in half, which I have done in the past, but decided not to this time around as I want to also treat my neck and decolletage."

Nothing they prescribed me worked! So I decided to stop all skin care and try this because I read somewhere that lactic acid helps with flaking that is found in some autoimmune skin conditions. I use this and then follow up with Bio Oil to increase the effectiveness of the acids as well as because this leaves my skin tacky a bit and tingly and oil neutralizes that. This takes the rash down to flat within 3 days. The oil makes the skin feel like heaven and prevents the flakes from being noticeable. I tried Drunk Elephant night glycolic acid serum and it immediately flared up again so I know there must be something in this - perhaps that lactic acid, maybe aloe, not sure.  Either way, the benefits are beyond taking the embarrassing scaly red bums down, now my whole face is looking brighter and glowier. I have been using it for 2 months daily. My olive skin is prone to dark spots after a pimple heals or if I get any scratch even, and this in combination with the Bio Oil has taken all those healing discolorations from the rash right away in one month! Almost forgot to say, I use Bio Oil on my mouth area, but use another oil for the rest of the face (Coachella Naturals Hempseed Oil)."

I never got any tingle or burning and my face didn't even turn red - even on dry patches and open acne spots. I do think they work really well as toner pads, but I moved onto stronger exfoliation (currently the ordinary glycolic acid toner & their peeling mask) as these are not enough for my troubled skin. but I would recommend them to other people especially people with very sensitive skin. I like that there is no fragrance."

So I bought a FAB box around Christmas, it contained several FAB products including these facial pads. I have combo sensitive skin, and these do not hurt my skin or increase redness. The first 3 days I used them I felt a VERY slight sting since Ive legit never used a chemical peel on my face before. It has cleared up acne (even overnight), reduced redness and dry flakes, and my skin is GLOWING! I just bought another full size. It is a staple in my skincare routine, I use one pad nightly. They are fully saturated so you wont get any dry pads like some other products. My fiance and I are getting married next year so I am upping my skincare game and after trying these, I cant imagine not using them. 110% worth it!"

Ive used so many products and none of them worked until I remembered that I have this. I gave it a second chance since I wanted my acne to go away asap(last resort!). I used it at night, topped it off with a niacinamide serum then moisturizer. Next morning I can see my acne starting to dry up! This is truly a great product if you are acne prone and wants to get rid of dark spots. Make sure to put moisturizer afterwards since this can dry out skin. Saving Tip: I cut mine either in half or quarters depending on how much I need the product. Usually a quarter is enough for me honestly! Also, keep rubbing it until the pad dries out!"

Like most FAB products there's not really a noticeable scent, just skincare ingredient scent, but it isn't strong and doesn't linger.  Due to the relatively high quality of the pads themselves and the saturation in the container I actually cut the stack in half when I open a new package of them as half of one is plenty for me."

I use it two times per week during my nightly routine.  On nights I use this I follow it with a light moisturizer (Clinique gel moisturizer opposed to my regular La Mer).  The next morning I always exfoliate (with Lushs Angel on Bare Skin) to draw out the impurities it draws to the surface.  My skin is adapting to it really nicely!  My redness has subsided (I also use vitamin e serum everyday before I apply sunscreen which helps), my overall tone is more even, and my skin looks bright + tight!  No burning, no chemical smell!  I love it!  On nights/mornings I dont use this to tone, I recommend Freshs rose toner.  Its gentle and pairs great with this product.  Thanks Sephora!"

My husband has even noticed the difference and has given me compliments. I saw some reviews that say the pad is too large, but this is something I disagree with. I find that the pad is just the right size- I wipe my face completely about 3 times to really get the area well as well as my neck and it is just the right amount. I am absolutely floored that I have found something that works so well for my troubled skin! I hope to never be without this product and I haven't even used it for a whole month yet!"

No more bumps and when i was my face in the shower its so smooth its basically slippery! Overall my skin has looked better since buying these.

A helpful sales associate recommended it to me a few years ago when I expressed concerns about my sensitive skin - I asked for something that would help with texture and dullness and mentioned that my skin dries out easily with most cleansers. She recommended that I use these (gently wiping, not scrubbing) in place of a morning cleanser, before toning etc, and only use a liquid cleanser in the evenings. I admit, I was skeptical, but it was a brilliant suggestion! This product has helped my skin tremendously (dulless/pores/overall texture and glow), makes my face feel fresh in the morning, and doesnt dry it out. It is, however, too strong to use twice a day on my skin, so if you also have sensitive skin, Id stick to the same once a day use (and then the product last two months, which is great). Tip: after using the pad on your face, wipe it along the backs of your hands as well!"
