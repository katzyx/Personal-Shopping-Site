I could smell the perfume without having sprayed it, so figured it somehow leaked. I went back to Sephora the next day and exchanged it without issue. Used it for a two week vacation, and the bottle is nearly gone. I've never had a problem with any other perfume evaporating, but that seems to be what is happening. Based on other reviews noting the same issue, there must be an issue with the bottle and how it is sealed. Will not purchase again."

Love the minimalist look and when you open the package you get a lovely glass bottle that is filled with this beautiful scent. When I first applied to my wrists it took me back to a forest - I smell sandalwood and pine. Itu2019s very refreshing but light. I love the way it smells on my body. I also love that this can be used by a man. Itu2019s a very attractive scent so I can see why both genders can use it. I wore it out one night and I could smell it in the warm air as I sipped on my wine. I really like that it is not overpowering like other scents - itu2019s very fresh and perfect for every day or special occasions. I honestly love this as an everyday scent & going to look at layering it with no 14 down the line. I highly recommend this scent if you love sandalwood."

How this smells on you will definitely depend on your chemistry though. My friend purchased the oil version and she loved it at first...but then the scent turned on her and started to smell like cat nip. Buying the smaller size is more prudent to see how it will react with your PH. Also, I didn't remove a star for it, but the bottle does have some issues - the top loosened significantly on me even though it has only been stored in a vertical position - so I would be wary of this if traveling with it and maybe put it in a Ziploc just in case."

Because perfumes smell different on each person I don't think I'd be able to tell if someone walked by me wearing this whether it was No. 4 or Santal 33. But I can tell sliiiight differences on myself. First difference is that this is a bit softer - not as strong projection, not as intense, and doesn't last as long (Santal lasts crazy long). But that's okay and to be expected because it's so much cheaper. The second is that while they are both unisex scents, No 4 is slightly sweeter (maybe from the cinnamon and nutmeg notes?) so sliiiightly more feminine, barely noticeable. Though again, still very unisex. I totally get why some people think it smells like dill pickles. On first spray I totally get that vibe and even when it dries I can still pick that up. But somehow even with that description it still works?! But it is a very herbally/woodsy scent so it won't be for everyone. There are many days I just want to smell like a sweet flower and this does not fit that bill. I understand that everyone in L.A. and in many other large cities smells like this bc Santal is so popular but where I'm from and in my social circles no one does, making it really unqiue and unexpected. Five stars for nailing this type of scent profile, if it's what you are into."

Priced at $28 for 6ml vile that realistically contains 4ml of product, this is even more expensive per ml than the Le Labo product it is knocking off. What's worse is the product is currently out of stock and cannot be exchanged! Needless to say I am extremely disappointed."

Itu2019s not as strong/punchy, but still gives you that fresh and energetic scent. In comparison to Commodityu2019s Book, this, to me, is not as dill-y and therefore more wearable.   Would recommend to pick this up in store instead, so you can avoid losing half your bottle!!"

I spent hours at Sephora making myself dizzy trying to find a green smelling fragrance that was unique, fresh smelling, and lovely. this is it! on me it smells excellent. nothing like dill pickles like another commented. I'm too old for sweet and fruity (I'm 33), I want to smell... intelligent and respectable, and not too overpowering for the office. I finally found my scent! I've spent years searching."

It starts off very spicy and on the masculine side, but it softens throughout the day into a totally different, but lovely scent. On me, I can still smell it after applying 8+ hours prior. Granted, it's definitely more subtle, but its noticeable enough for me to catch whiffs of now and again. Very satisfied with my purchase."
