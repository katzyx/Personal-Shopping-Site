You can set it or not, which I also appreciate. I don't find it gets cakey. It's sorta natural-matte. It does have a paint-y smell at first. The only weird thing is you really do have to swatch the colours for yourself. The colours are kinda off. Like I use nw24 in this but a lot of concealers even the lightest shade is too dark for my undereye. For reference I use nars rcc in vanilla.

I've tried a few different concealers to brighten my under eyes but find they look cakey or makeupy - either right away or as the day wears on. The consistency of this MAC concealer spreads nicely but doesn't cling to my dry patches. I also like that there is a shade that matches my pale, but rose-toned skin."

Top marks for a great shade range.  Though, I just couldn't get past the smell of the product ... very strong alcohol scent (much stronger than the usual Studio Fix scent) I couldn't use it !!  I found the consistency quite thin and coverage not so great.  I expected a lot more from a MAC concealer.  If you are a MAC loyalist you may be able to get past the scent ... the only pros I can truly provide are the amazing shade range, bang on with that aspect ... smooth and bendable application.  I would not consider this concealer to be full coverage.  It's far too thin in consistency but the finish is quite nice.  It's one of those things ... you will either love it or hate it depending on your needs.  xx"

            "review_text": "Purchased this a few days ago and itu2019s already a staple. I have sensitive and combination skin and have never had an issue with Mac products, but this really impressed me. Iu2019ve been using it to cover acne scars and then using Nars creamy radiant under my eyes. This stays put all day. Just off the wand I am able to conceal my entire face, so it should last a long time. The coverage is medium, but light if that makes sense. It covers my scars easily (I blend it out with my finger), keeps me matte but not dry looking. It does such a great job that I donu2019t have to use foundation. Not sure I would recommend this for under the eyes though.  I also havenu2019t noticed a scent which I love.   For reference Iu2019ve been trying to make NARS soft matte concealer work and found it just didnu2019t work the way I wanted it too. I didnu2019t like that I had to sheer it out. This MAC concealer is buildable and doesnu2019t have to be sheered out if you are going for a light makeup look.  The only thing I donu2019t like about it is the colour code. I am NW45 in studio fix fluid but NW51 in this concealer. For instance, NW50 in studio fix fluid (foundation) is too dark for me, but NW50 in this concealer is darker than NW51...makes no sense. Glad they added more shades, but it left me confused. I would recommend going In store to test out the shade. Donu2019t go with your studio fix fluid shade!"
