I have no idea but it makes me not get oily throughout the day. Insane! The reason why I’m giving this product 4/5 stars is just because it does NOT cover my pores. I use the luminous silk foundation from Armani. And although the two pair well together, my pots are pretty visible still. It takes a lot more effort to conceal them than I would like. OVERALL, deffffff get this product if you have oily skin!!!!!!"

I don't know what kind of magic Danessa puts in this little tin, but it's what I've been waiting for all of my life. it's excellent for low makeup days as well as full glam days.  It's got a lot of pigment, so use it sparingly until you get the hang of it.  I will buy this product for as long as they make it. total game changer."

With this, I haven't had to use a sheet even once! 8+ hours of wear and my skin is still matte and oil is in check!  Can't wait to order a tinted shade next and layer as a foundation/spot conceal.

It also feels like you aren’t even wearing makeup (I usually hate feeling foundation on my skin). I rated this 4 stars because of the limited shade range (not sure I’ve found my perfect color match yet) but this formula is pretty amazing for oily girls."

I kept hearing about it and when Sephora had it as a reward, I figured why not (fully expecting it to make my face a greasy mess). I have a very oily t-zone, it's literally the bane of my existence, but this product makes me blurred & pore free all day. I don't use foundation, so I can't say how it works with that. I do my normal morning skincare, put this on in my t-zone area, and layer primer on top (right now Benefit Porefessional). Then I do a light dusting of setting powder & spray. Voila, blurred to perfection all day long!"

It looks and goes on like Vaseline, which is basically the last thing I’d ever think to put on my extremely oily face. I hated how it felt and looked — greasy. I nearly washed it off. But I didn’t and I set my timer for 5 minutes, which is always the length of time I want to allow a primer to set. After five minutes, still didn’t look great, but it wasn’t quite as greasy. If anything, I couldn’t even see it. I did my eye makeup, brows, lip gloss. This all took about 10 minutes… and then somehow, magically, the primer was set and my skin looked amazing. Hands down, amazing. Couldn’t see my pores. My skin looked softly matte and evened out but like I had nothing on it. My super oily skin stayed matte for 6 hours before I felt any need to blot, and when I did, it wasn’t even that oily. What witchcraft is this? Nothing about this product make sense to me… but it works. I will add that I don’t love the tinted balm as much. It seemed to dry down differently and wasn’t as blurring or smoothing. But the universal rocks."

I LOVE this product,  I mean LOVE IT, and have to force myself to use my other foundations,  as this product feels like nothing on once it self sets and gives a light blur coverage. It is buildable for more makeupy days and also low-key enough for errands days. A truly unique and stellar product, and I will always repurchase it. For reference, I have combination 52 year old skin, and it does not sit, break, cling to dry skin, or slip in the tzone.  Think your skin but better(an often used marketing term that I have never seen achieved until this product)."

This is a balm cream that is shockingly light in texture,  not heavy,  you do not feel it sitting on your skin,  and it sort of absorbs after applying,  leaving you feeling like you are wearing nothing,  but you get smooth even toned skin. Truly a skin perfecter rather than a skin cover, your skin looks like your skin,  only better. It also stays put, does not slide or melt off, and I look just as even toned after 9 hours as I did at application.  I am shocked by how good this is. I have foundations I love but in my opinion this is better than all of them."

I myself struggle with dehydrated skin and because this is so mattifying, it clinged to my dry patches and texture and looked VERY POWDERY (even more than my cheapest drugstore powder foundation). That being said, it is a great and innovative formula for oily skin types, but if you struggle with dehydrated skin underneath your oily skin, then this product may not be for you."

I wasn't sure about the right amount to use, so I was careful. I massaged it into my skin with my fingers in a circular pattern. The texture is silky and it smoothly moves across my skin. It could easily serve as a base for makeup. I believe you might not need a separate primer with this. It left my skin feeling smooth and the texture appeared better. It's light and acts more like a tint than a heavy layer. It even helps to conceal pores. It transformed my complexion, making it look more even. I'm thoroughly impressed. It feels like a natural product without being too heavy. This is incredible. I have combination skin, and it's perfect. It doesn't feel greasy and seems to manage oil well. The following day, I tried it with a primer and set it with powder. It worked wonders. My skin felt completely different compared to when I use other foundations. There was no oiliness. It also kept my makeup in place all day."

What's weird is that I don't have particularly sensitive skin and have never reacted to anything like this before, but I'm certain this was the cause because I tried it three different times a few weeks apart and had a bad reaction each time. (I may have been in denial because I really wanted it to work!)   I don't think this is a common reaction, but I wanted to post a review so anyone with the same experience doesn't think they're crazy.

Like I have eczema so I have to be really careful about the products I use. Typically things that are supposed to be luminous make me break out but since this didn't say it does that I figured it would be okay.

I’ve changed the techniques I’ve used in application, such  as using a brush, using my fingers, applying it on top as a setting balm, etc. but no matter what, it leads to my face becoming greasy. The product also makes my setting powder separate horribly, giving me major cakeface. I wanted to love this product but it just doesn’t do it for me. I’ll likely be returning this to switch it out for a different primer unless there’s some kind of breakthrough. I’m giving the two stars because it does do an excellent job at burring your pores, and the packaging is lovely."

I do use it mostly in the summer because my skin gets a lot more dry in the winter, but in summer it is AMAZING at keeping my skin from looking too shiny/sweaty/oily in the hot, humid weather. I wonder if some of the negative reviews aren't prepping the skin well and/or are applying too much? If it's highlighting dry patches, you might need to moisturize/exfoliate your skin more first. If it's looking greasy possibly you're using too much? It starts as a balm that does initially feel kind of oily and strange, but it dries down into a matte finish. I don't typically wear foundation though so I can't speak to how it might interact.  My personal process: Usually I'll apply a moisturizing sunscreen first. Then if I'm doing makeup I'll use Glossier skin tint plus possibly some concealer and cream contour/blush. Then my preference is to dig out some of this product with the little scoop that it comes with, rub that between my two fingers to liquify it a bit, and then press it into the parts of my face that need it (usually my T zone, basically, but on really hot humid days it might be everywhere). I use the universal translucent shade because I'm very fair and not really looking for coverage anyway.  I bought this once already and used every last drop! Back buying another translucent and might try out a tinted shade too."

Nothing ever worked for me… UNTIL NOW. After skin prep I use this balm as a primer of sorts, goes on creamy and dries matte and powder like. I then use a light layer of foundation and concealer in the areas I need, lightly dab on Mac’s setting powder in my ot-zone and finish off with a setting spray. It cut my oil production in half and I only need to touch up with a blotting sheet after 7-8 hours. My makeup stays in place as well. If you’ve struggled with oily skin your entire life this could be it y’all. Remember skin prep/ proper application of all your products is vital, but as far as formula goes I’m never putting this down."

I have combination skin, acne prone, large pores. Except Estée Lauder stay in place all other brands make me oily in less than an hour and I'm constantly blotting. I was very skeptical about the color match (CN 28 Ivory in Clinique Even Better) but i ordered the 3 in DM blurring balm. Also considering there were so many negative reviews. I used my fingers to apply this and I was shocked at the result. It is like a balm but when it goes on your skin it's smooth and it's matte!!!! It is really strange. The color match was spot on. It def gives a blurred look, which is surprisingly natural. The only thing to watch out for combination skin is dry patches. If you have dry flaky skin anywhere on your face, this will highlight it. When I had that issue I used warm water and cotton to gently take the skin off. So I had to reapply the product.  After 5 hours I didn't need a retouch or blotting. If you have oily, combination skin I highly recommend you try this."

I especially love the way my skin looks flawless and smooth. The only reason I gave it 4-stars is because there is a really bad smell. It smells almost chemical or like car oil….I can’t really describe it other than that and it’s strong but I don’t smell it after I wear it for a while.

At first, it may appear greasy - but after you set it with powder, it is like magic, and stays put all day without smearing. I have super oily, acne-prone, imperfect skin. I have been on the hunt for decades for the perfect foundation. Despite having dark marks and a pimple here and there, I do not want to look casket fresh. I previously used Lancome, Nars, Revlon, Hourglass, Fenty, etc. So, I have had my take on products. Yummy Skin Blurring Balm Powder combined with Juice Boost is perfection!

The Danessa Myricks Beauty Yummy Skin Blurring Balm Powder has become a staple in my routine for several reasons.  What I Love:  Blurring Effect: This product excels at blurring pores, fine lines, and skin texture, leaving my skin looking smooth and natural. It’s perfect for a polished look without appearing too made-up. I wear reading glasses, which often leave marks on the bridge of my nose, but this balm minimizes their visibility effectively. Lightweight and Comfortable: The balm-to-powder formula is incredibly lightweight and doesn’t feel heavy on my skin. It’s perfect for my everyday, no-makeup makeup look. I use it after my regular morning skincare routine (serum, moisturizer, and sunscreen) without needing an additional primer. Versatile Use: Whether I’m using it as a light foundation or setting my makeup, this product holds up throughout my busy day. For longer wear, I apply a face powder over it, and my makeup stays put without moving. It doesn’t cause any skin irritation, which is a big plus. Application: I apply the balm with my fingers, ensuring my hands are clean and washed. The product spreads easily, and a little goes a long way. I haven’t had to reapply throughout the day, even with my hectic schedule. Room for Improvement: Coverage: The coverage is on the lighter side, which might not suit everyone’s needs. If you’re looking for full coverage, this might not be the best choice. However, it’s perfect for a natural, skin-like finish. Shade Matching: Finding the perfect shade can be tricky, so I recommend trying it in-store if possible. It’s crucial to get the right match to avoid looking too light or too dark. Overall, the Danessa Myricks Beauty Yummy Skin Blurring Balm Powder is a fantastic addition to my makeup routine. It’s quick, efficient, and leaves me looking fresh and polished all day l"

			"review_text": "I have been shopping at Sephora for 15 years but this product inspired me to write my first review ever. I ran a test comparing the Universal Blurring Balm to my MILK primer (which I have been using for 4 years). This is the month of June in hot, commuting conditions in New York City. I used each primer under my Estee Lauder Double Wear foundation on back-to-back days. No difference in my activities on both days. I moisturized my face at 8:00am as I always do. I put on makeup on both days at 5:30pm, went out, and came home to sleep at midnight. So I have yet to see the maximum strength time of the Blurring Balm Powder. I was already shiny before makeup application because of my combination skin on both days. I contoured, blushed, and powdered as usual. With MILK, after 4 hours, my T-zone had a little  shine coming through that I blotted as usual. With Danessa Blurring Balm Powder I saw NO shine after 7 hours. Nothing to blot.  I would have gone longer if I didn't have to sleep. I returned my newly replenished MILK primer to the store the next day. (sorry to MILK but Danessa Myricks Blurring Balm took down your primer in my makeup bag. it is possible that MILK primer does not particularly agree with Estee Lauder Double Wear but that is not my business to research). I hardly wear makeup but will next month test out the Blurring Balm Powder under Estee Lauder Double Wear foundation from 12:00pm to 9:00pm at an outdoor event coming up. I will also do another test with my Lancome Ultra Matte Foundation on other days, using each primer. I'll report back if anything changes in the Blurring Balm Powder performance. In case you are curious- my shade in Lancome Ultra Matte is 500 Suede W and my shade in Estee Lauder Double Wear is 5 N 2 Amber Honey. Cheers!"

Young ladies with no pores and dewy skin - you may want to give this a try because of its unique texture. I suggest also buying the brand's Kabuki brush that goes with it.

			"review_text": "I've used several versions of product similar to DM's Blurring Balm over the years. As ingredients and technology continue to advance, so to have the formulatons, but at the end of the day balm products are engineered to provide a powder like finish. If powder porducts don't work for you in general due to aging skin, acne, dry skin, etc., DM's Blurring Balm likely won't either. Judging by customer reviews this product is either a hit or miss for most people.  I've always liked the idea of balm-to-powder products but have yet to find a version that's actually hydrating, doesn't settle into pores, or cling to dry patches of skin. Being a huge fan of DM Beauty I went against my better judgment and purcahsed this product in Colour:1. Colour:1 matches my skin tone due to being approx. 1/2 a shade darker in real life vs.online pictures. I wasn't a fan of the scent - reminds me of expired skin care/makeup and smells a bit off.  As other reviewers have mentioned; play around with this product to find a mode of application that works best for you.  Brush application was a no-go for me. Balm immediately settled into my pores and looked patchy in other areas. BB Sponge application was more successful using a light patting motion. Unfortunately, after the product dried down, it still settled into my pores and clung to areas on my face where I have drier skin. I think this balm will be benefical for some but it's defiinetly skin specific. It'll either work for you or it won't."

The shades seem super random, for example the lightest shade has neutral undertones then the next two darker shades are super yellow, and nothing in between? I thought this was maybe because the product is sheer enough that the undertone wouldn't matter as much, but it's definitely opaque enough that you can tell the undertone is off. Second, this product is suuuuuper thin in consistency (didn't expect since it's called a balm) and extremely slippery, almost oily. My face looked super streaky and the product kept moving around on my face as I tried to blend it in. It brought out all of my skin texture and emphasized dry patches I didn't even realize were there. Coverage is minimal, there is no blurring effect at all, in fact the exact opposite of blurring. I also never noticed the product turn into a powder consistency like it's supposed to, it just stayed slippery and greasy on my face (I have combo/oily skin). It also had a flatness to it that made my skin look super dull. Will definitely return."

There is a big difference between 8 and 8.5, 8.5 having a neutral undertone and what ultimately worked for me.  I have always had extremely oily skin. I mean, shiny within an hour and if I wiped my face with paper it would turn translucent. This is the first product I’ve ever used where after an entire day out and about, my face is still matte. I also took a nap with this stuff on, which would usually leave me extremely oily, but it wasn’t. One note, if you have dry patches, they will be pronounced. I had an old breakout healing and it became a dry patch with this on.  I’m of the era where we called foundation “coverup” and NW47 or NW43 was the colour from Mac Studio fix that every brown skinned girl that I knew wore. Ive used Estée Lauder [5N1.5/6W1], Chanel Water Fresh tint in [deep/medium deep], Nars [Macao MD4], Fenty [410/420] from her very first launch, and many many more. I’ve simply been trying to work with what I can find.   I use Shiseido 510 Suede now which is the nearest I’ve ever gotten but is my winter shade.  At 35, with at least 20 years of wearing foundation, I have finally found my exact match. I use it as foundation and it’s enough coverage to cover my dark eyelids, black spots and an inch long curling iron burn on my cheek. My face has never felt so flawless.   So long story short, this product is sorcery and I’m in love."

			"review_text": "This has been my go-to foundation for months. I have extrememly oily skin and this leaves a soft matte finish that stays matte for hours. I apply on bare skin, only over my spf, with a sponge using sweeping motions, and this gives smooth, even coverage that isn't too heavy. It does a great job of eliminating redness and reducing the appearance of blemishes, although it is light coverage so it won't hide them completely. It is very buildable, though, and I am able to acheive higher coverage by dabbing it on in certain areas that need it. Treat this like a powder, and prep skin accordingly. It WILL cling to dry/flakey skin, just like any other powder, so I make sure to moisturize heavily before bed and exfoliate every so often (I have oily skin, but am currently using Tretinoin, which makes me peel occaisionally). I set very LIGHTY with powder in areas that tend to crease, like under my eyes. However, I'd advise against setting too heavily with powder since this can lead to a cakey look (again, treat this product like a powder- there's really no need to layer powder over powder). I don't ever really use the scoop that comes with it, since the product works much better when applied with a sponge. I just dab directly into the container. I do wish there was just one more shade lighter and more cool-toned than the current lightest shade. But since it is a lighter-coverage product, I'm able to get away with using a shade thats slightly deeper and more yellow than my skin tone. Overall, I've really enjoyed this product and will definitely be repurchasing when I run out."

I have never experienced a truly non-transferable look with my foundation until this product. I made the mistake of getting an exact color match.

But I paired this product with the Yummy Powder Serum and my skin was nearly perfect ALL DAY. I maybe started showing a little bit of oil around the 7-8 hour mark but I truly didn’t even have to touch up. This lasted so much longer than any foundation I’ve ever tried. I was expecting super light/sheer coverage but it had a lot more coverage than I anticipated (in a good way, I would say light to medium coverage which was what I was looking for). It took a little playing around with to figure out the best way to apply it (I did a combo of using my fingers and a brush) and I did have to pat/roll it in but once it was blended, I was obsessed. I used a setting powder as well, as I always do, so I’m sure that helped too but again, it was so much better than my usual matte primer combo (makeup forever matte primer paired with benefit’s porefessional) and foundation. This will definitely be my go-to summer foundation because I always need extra oil control in the summer months plus I like lighter coverage in the summer. Also of note, I LOVE the packaging and the little spoon it comes with. You get a decent amount of product for the price and a little goes a long way. I definitely scooped out too much the first time. If you have oily skin, this is absolutely worth a try!"

Finally, I bought the Blurring Balm in Shade 3, and have been using it for a week. I can't get enough. It completely blurs all the pores on my cheeks and around my nose, layers like a dream, and keeps me matte all day without feeling tight or crusty. I'll dare to say my makeup looks even better later in the day. I don't wear foundation, only a bit of concealer in my T-zone, because I don't like the mask-face look. Blurring Balm doesn't have much coverage, but it evens everything out while still letting my freckles shine through, and is a gorgeous base for powders, creams and liquids. It has been added to my makeup bag and daily routine. I'm 38 and have my core products that I use, and this has become one of them. I don't know what kind of magic is in this stuff, but my makeup has never looked this good! If you're on the fence, buy it! Pat it into the skin rather than swiping. You don't need any kind of other primers. Some days, if I'm not doing full makeup, I'll use the translucent balm over my skincare, add a bit of Nars undereye color corrector, a light dust of powder, blue abs mascara, and it looks great! I still can't believe how well it blurs my significant pores on my nose and cheeks!"

I primed half of my face with the One/Size Secure the Sweat primer (which claims to make your makeup waterproof + sweatproof) and the other half with DM Yummy Skin Balm in Universal. Neither sides had any separation or anything too drastic, but the noticeable thing was that the DM was matte- it literally looked like I went and blotted it with a POWDER. One/Size had a slight, slight shine, not even anything crazy, it just looked like a drastic difference in comparison to the DM. I was beyond impressed to say the least. The fact that it applies without over-drying is the cherry-on-top, it controls oil WITHOUT drying out your skin. Danessa Myricks is a genius. Added the full-size to my cart so fast."

My skin is balanced and can sometimes feel dry, and I love matte finish but never like the look of powder. This product is the perfect solution! The size was also bigger than I expected, and for the way it works and blends well with other foundations, it's a good cost value. You truly only need the tiniest bit for a whole face. Like pea sized (maybe a large pea).  I use brushes for everything but preferred my finger tips for this product. On its own you get a light coverage that evens out skin tone with a matte/airbrushed look. On top of the Yummy Skin Tint, it's close to a medium coverage. It wore well all day, no touch ups needed - and that was without setting spray! Although it was great as a foundation primer, it didn't like it as an eyelid primer. You'll still need something on top of this if you truly don't want eye shadow creasing.   Color match was perfect!

There is a learning curve to using this. I personally use the bottom of a sponge and really work it into my skin to avoid pilling or patching. What I really think this would be great for is an alternative to powder for dry skin. I have used it to set my under eyes with the same method using the sponge… NO additional creasing, my under eyes feel super hydrated, and they look incredibly smooth. It will feel balmy the rest of the day if worn as a topper, so if you’re not into that save your money  TLDR: You WILL need to practice because it can get rowdy quickly, but I think dry skin folks out there will love it."

It had a balmy kinda creamy feeling as you warm it up on your fingers or you could use a brush or sponge to gently and lightly press it in to your skin and then it basically had a light finish as if it was a powder so you would have a blurred/filtered effect on your face and be slightly more matte finish but still have a dewy glow.

			"review_text": "One thing about Danessa Myricks: she never fails at coming through with unique products. This is no exception: an oil-controlling balm-like foundation/primer/bronzer??  Here are some of my observations: the universal shade seems to be the most oil-controlling. It’s actually a really big difference in my opinion, so if that’s why you are buying this, I might suggest you opt for that (or combine it with the tinted versions)  Secondly, a little goes a long way! There’s a scoop included in the packaging, and while it’s absolutely adorable, I find that it’s best to just lightly dip my fingers in, warm up the product in my hand, and then spread it onto my skin. This gives a lovely, instant blurring effect and acts great as a balancing product. As far as shades offered, these do run a little lighter and a little warmer, but overall are surprisingly adjustable.  Finally, I haven’t seen anyone mention this but it might be that I have a tricky skin type: this makes an INCREDIBLE bronzer on me!? I have dry skin but an oily scalp. It’s so frustrating that my foundation breaks up around my hairline the most! I found that adding the smallest amount of the tinted versions works incredibly well as both a bronzer and at preventing that situation. If opting for a bronzer, I would suggest you go with a deeper shade and a neutral undertone. I can wear it over or under a foundation as well, as this truly is a multi-purpose product.  Overall, I am so glad I had the chance to try it as there really is nothing else on the market quite like this product!"

When using it as a primer I find that I don’t need to use any concealer because it offers so much coverage on it it’s own, but not quite enough to not use foundation. I have to use minimum foundation when using this as a primer, which is a big bonus and leaves such a flawless complexion! I don’t think I’ve ever seen my skin have such an even skin told and I love it to bits. And goes along way! I was pleasantly surprised because of how heavy/thick it is that it worked well with my combination skin. Typically something so thick would make me get oil throughout the day, but this hasn’t caused me any issues with oil buildup! This is a big winner in my book, and so happy to have found it!

Whilst looking for new products to try in this category, I came across this balm to powder complexion product, which had me pretty curious to try it. This balm powder is a cross between a push cushion and powder in a vegan-friendly formula which is clean and good for skin. Its main purpose is to provide a smooth, natural finish that blurs and refines skin, leaving it texture free. I saw it also has Upsalite which helps balance oils throughout the day and tackle any sweat - perfect for warm Summer days - and with hyaluronic acid too it helps keep skin hydrated. Personally, the best thing I’ve noticed after a week’s use is that my fine lines aren't as noticeable, so I’m quite pleased with that! It really looks beautiful on and has a texture unlike anything I’ve sampled before! Really lightweight and gives a soft glow to the skin. It comes with a small dispenser, although I find applying with fingers allows for a quicker application and it seems to blend better. I admit I have also used this under a foundation as a primer and it provided the perfect base. With 14 different shades available, catering to a mix of skin tones, there’s a nice selection to choose from. If you’re looking for a natural matte look while keeping it lightweight, I recommend giving this a try.   ~ My Sephora Top 7 must-have list ~  (My top 7 must-have beauty products of all time, focusing mainly on my purchases at Sephora)  1.

I’m mid-fifties and have oily skin and pores that I would love to make less obvious with a product like this, and I tried a little on the back of my hand in-store and was impressed with how smooth and dry it felt afterwards, so I bought the Universal “shade”. Well I am pretty good with my makeup application skills after forty years at it and love playing with new makeup, but no matter what I tried I have just not been able to make this work for me! I tried it under my liquid foundation(s) (I have a number of different ones), over my foundation (like a powder”), and mixed with my foundation. I have used another primer underneath, or skipped it. I have applied with my fingers (patting it), with a stippling motion with a flat top brush, and with my beauty blender. No success no matter what — because no matter how it’s applied, my skin looks patchy and my makeup starts breaking up after just a couple of hours. It’s a disaster by the end of an eight hour day! And any colour cosmetics used along with it (liquid or powder blushes and/or bronzer) start to change colour along with breaking up. Although my skin may not look as oily, with all the patchiness I only look good and my skin “blurred” if you stand farther away where you can’t see the surface very clearly. I frankly feel embarrassed walking around like that. By the end of the day, I can literally “feel” it heavy on my skin and can’t wait to wash it off as soon as I can. I don’t have any of those experiences at all with my usual routines. I frequently get compliments on how nice my skin looks with my foundations even! I have been using Tatcha’s solid primer for the past several months and I find it at times can make my skin look a little bit too shiny by mid-morning, and I expected this to be similar but without the shine. Nope. I’m going back to Tatcha thru the colder months and my Milk Hydrogrip alone the rest of"

The key is to make sure moisturizer and sunscreen have soaked in and then apply in LIGHT layers. Next I use a small amount concealer in some areas and then I powder the t-zone and undereye lightly. It doesn't cover everything, it's more a light coverage/ skin tint look, but at my age that's what I want.

			"review_text": "This product works very well, but you HAVE to follow Danessa's recommendations. She created the product, so she knows how it works lol. Your skin must be properly moisturized before applying this balm. After using my regular skincare products, including sunscreen, I apply Danessa's beauty oil with gold leaf and follow up with her yummy skin glow. I don't think you need to use these products, I just like using products from the same brand. If you don't care for this, just make sure your skin is moisturized. Anyway, after moisturizing my skin, my face is PREPPED for the balm. This balm can be applied with fingers, a sponge, or a brush. I prefer to use a dense brush because I feel that this gives the best coverage. The finish is very natural, a my skin but better kind of vibe. It actually gets better as the day progresses - no touch ups needed. It can be used as a foundation and paired with concealers, bronzers/contours, and blushes in order to do a full face. If you're in a rush in the mornings, as I am most of the time, I wear it all alone. It self-sets, so I never use a powder or even a setting spray. I use my brush to put it on and I leave the house. I have a mirror at my work desk that I keep just to check on my makeup because certain brands have just done me so wrong. Now, I cannot stop looking at this mirror while I'm at work because I just can't believe how good this product looks on me. I'm afraid my coworkers think I'm vain, but I don't care lol. I hope Danessa never discontinues this product. I've been wearing makeup for a very long time and I even stopped for a bit because other brands either irritated my skin, oxidized horribly, or simply didn't deliver what was promised. I've wasted a lot of money throughout the years and I can say for sure: this product was a great investment. Absolute 10/10!"

My beef is with the monotony of the undertone options.  I tried shades 1, 3, and 3.5 searching for something really neutral because even though my skin is cool toned, I can usually wear a neutral foundation just fine.  For me, neutral means light tan without excessive warmth or coolness.  The only difference between 1, 3, and 3.5 is the intensity of the yellowish-orange undertone.  So far as I can tell, there is no option in this product that is actually TAN or cool toned.  I can make this product work by applying directly over my glowy sunscreen where the whiteness of the zinc oxide tones down the orangeness, and then I modify the tone with a true brown or rose-toned bronzer but that kind of defeats the ease of use and adds a hassle factor.  (BTW, the Groundwork palette has the same deficiency - too much orange and yellow tone in the shade selections.)"

This product did all of that for me. I think of it as the Charlotte Tilbury Hollywood Flawless Filter for people with oily skin. It has a natural coverage (is buildable though) and doesn't make me oily. For a more full coverage look, I add some of the Nars concealer, but most days, I just wear some Yummy Skin for the natural look. I use the spatula to scoop the product, then I use my fingers to dab it on the spots I want, blending with a Beauty Blender. It lays very well on the skin. I do use a heavier moisturizer when I use this product, though, because the oil wicking is so good, I notice my skin looks a little dry. Completely opposite problem than I'm used to, so it doesn't bother me much. If you have dry skin, I can see how this would bother you, though."

Idk if wearing masks throughout the pandemic did something to my pores in the middle of my upper and lower lip areas because they sweat way more than ever before. I’m sure the heat in California lately hasn’t helped but nowadays my make up breaks in those areas due to excessive sweat.  POINT IS, this product has helped IMMENSELY with this new problem. I literally barely sweat with this and the tiny bit that does break through doesn’t ruin my make up. Naturally this helps a lot with my t zone that’s always been oily.  I’m SOOO stoked to have found this product! A little goes a long way, it’s blurring, and has become a new staple in my makeup bag. Mom"

I cannot use it at all on its own and look good as it settles to look 'broken' in appearance and quite obvious. While it does work halfway decently as a primer on some parts of my face (and that's how I mainly use it since I don't want the product to go to waste), I find that it results in polka dot pores on my nose where my pores are largest, and makes my undereye area look incredibly dry and cakey, so I mainly use it on the rest of my T-zone and cheeks. I devote a lot of time to skincare and skin prep, and have figured out which products work best with this balm powder for the most flattering results, but I can honestly say I believe there are better products out there for more mature skin. Mature women with smaller pores and less oily skin may love it, and definitely younger skin may look great with it, but it just doesn't work great for my skin and skin type.   As a side note, if I apply it to my lips, I noticed that my lip products last MUCH longer with zero tendency to bleed."

I typically have oily skin, but in fall and winter my skin gets very dry. This blurring balm looks so natural and flawless after my skin prep. I wear this to the gym and absolutely love it - I can sweat and my skin still looks like skin, and it does not break me out. I do not use this when I wear foundation or a full face of makeup. I have repurchased this 3x now and can't wait to see what other innovative products Danessa Myricks creates!"

			"review_text": "The Blurring Balm Powder is one of my HOLY GRAIL complexion products. I have oily, textured aging skin with rosacea on my cheeks & chin. I am shade 5 which is perfect for my medium/tan warm olive skin tone. I use this almost every day as a light foundation...it covers enough of my redness and blemishes to even out my skin. When I have more time, I use the balm powder as a primer and it is glorious. It blurs and controls my oil & texture, and my foundations go on beautifully. I've also used the balm powder with just powder on top, for a light natural look. It really does control my oil all day, without drying down my skin. When I'm paler in winter, I can also use Shade 4. My favorite way to use this is not with the scope or beauty blender, but my foundation brush like the BK Beauty 101 brush and stipple it onto my face for a light layer. A little goes a long way, so don't put too much or it could get cakey. This formula is genius with the upsalite and Danessa Myricks is an innovative artist with this hero product. I've already panned one, and that is saying a lot since I have a big makeup collection. This balm powder is always on my vanity as a daily use product. Highly recommend. This is my FAVORITE product from her entire make up line! MUST HAVE! I've reviewed this on my YT channel @MikiCarrBeauty as my top products of 2022!"

Not nearly as oily as my face can get on it own. Although it doesn't do much for blurring pores. Also, the one time I had a dry patch, which is very rare for me, it did cling and look patchy, so this is not for anyone with dry or combo skin.  P.S. There is such a thing as too matte. If you use this with a matify primer and setting spray, your skin will be too dry and produce more oil. Making it not last as long. Try this with a hydrating primer."

While the initial texture of the product is like butter,   if your skin has any hint of drynes or  any texture at all,  this likely isn't for you. It left a powdery residue that clings to any texture and cakes on dry patches. I admittedly did a spot treatment a few days ago and have a few dry patches which is very abnormal for me, and the product created beige flakes on those areas. I will give it another go when my skin is back to normal/ oily. But even still, I am not crazy about the powder finish and the color also runs quite yellow IMO. This could be great for someone with super oily baby skin, that is on the yellow side."

I believe this would work best for oily skin and it appears to work best when used in thin layers which can be built up as needed. In my experience, between the translucent and tinted shades, I have had a hard time getting it to meet its claims. As a primer it looks dry, even under a moisturizing skin tint. As a foundation over primer and alone, it doesn’t last, even with powder. This product enhanced my pores and is not blurring. I would only wear this for short outings no longer than 5-6 hours.  In summary, this is not for me but I can see how it could fulfill a need for other skin types and in other conditions."

When I first got this I was struggling to use it but realized I was using too much! Like with any DMB products, start out with the smallest amount and you probably won’t need more. One of my favorite ways to use shade 1 is after bronzing and blushing, i go over my t-zone with shade 1 to help blur and diffuse sharp lines and bring the whole look together, plus it provides a nice blurring and setting effect for the area with the largest pores.  Shade universal is a great blurring primer, or you can mix it with other products to create a nice lasting blush, undereye concealer, etc!  I recently picked up shade 6 hoping to use a a bronzer — the formula is so amazing that i know this was a great idea, but sadly shade 6 looks a bit orange on my fair skin. I would definitely love for Danessa to create a few more cooler tones in this formula!"

If you use a primer first it will come out more dewy depending on the primers/skincare. I apply it with my fingers first then use a powder puff to pat it in. Similar to using a makeup sponge. It lasts all day. It doesn't feel like it is melting off after a long hot humid day. I really like it. I may play with it more and try it as a primer or setting powder and see how it goes."

If you want oil control and the color selection works for you, it is definitely worth trying."

I used brushes similar to her vids for an even cleaner application. It provided significant ease in placement and blending! Used Shade #6 for brightening areas.  Oil control all day as many people mentioned and subtle lightening up of the shade that is mostly inconspicuous.  Very compatible with other skincare and make-up brands applied under and over it!!  The units are pretty large so you get a lot of product!  Enjoy!!!!"

I apply a thin layer on my t-zone under my regular powder and I don't see oil breakthrough the entire day. If anything, I only see a slight, natural looking glow at the very end of my 12 hour shift, which actually makes my makeup look even prettier. It's surreal that this makes me look nicer as the day progresses, I've never experienced anything like it. It's been a month now and I've barely made a dent in the product - so it's definitely worth the price. One thing I will note is that it has a very very minuscule scent, almost herbal, that you can really only smell if sniffing the product directly, but I think it's lovely and makes me feel like I'm applying skincare. Truly holy grail, I'm never looking back."

My only complaint is the shade range. I feel the line could use some in-between shades or more undertones to be a bit more balanced and well-rounded out. I have combo skin....oily t-zone, dry under-eyes, dry perimeter of my face, especially where my forehead meets my hairline (I had eczema as a kid, and once in a blue moon, I get stress-induced flare-ups). However, as always, skin prep is key. I don't see people on the drier side, especially if you have flaky patches. This may emphasize dry texture, especially if you aren't doing hydrating skincare prep. However, as an oily gal, this product has impressive oil control. I don't set it in the winter, but I do so (lightly for outings/parties or dinner) during the summer. This quickly became a go-to fave because it wears very well and feels weightless on the skin, and is versatile. It can work for no-makeup makeup, but also for my full glam, too. The coverage is med but can be built up.  (Pics are from different wear days, ofc)"

I have insanely sensitive, dry, rosacea-prone and hormonal skin. I’ve been using Bellini, Dancing Queen and the Universal shade and all three products beautifully blur pores and manage my oily t-zone throughout the day.

By the end of the day, I'm glistening like an oil field and you could probably get a proper sample size of oil off my face. I don't know what kind of magic the technology they use in this product is but it literally controls my oil completely. So completely that it makes me dry!  If you have combo skin or oily-dehydrated skin like I do (the same areas on my face will have flaking, dehydrated skin but also be very oily) then I suggest moisturizing very well beforehand or using this only as a primer under a more dewy foundation/bb cream. Personally, I've used this as a full foundation, as a light layer similar to bb cream, and as a primer under other skin products. For my skin type, I find what works best is using it in a light layer like a bb cream, and this way I get the benefits of the oil control without the negative side effects of looking dry/matte.   If you're dry at all I would stay away from this product - I've also found it has a built-up effect after multiple uses. I was becoming less oily in general even when I wasn't wearing the product, just from using it every day. As much as I'd like to be less oily I wasn't a fan of completely losing my oiliness (even if it clogs my pores it also makes my skin springy and dewy) and using it in a thin layer also solved that.   I was never a huge foundation person and could never find anything that worked. This works. It's a solid holy grail product for me and I will repurchase it over and over again."

I have incredibly oily skin on my cheek and T zone and almost nothing works to keep my oil at bay. I tried a lot of high end to drugstore setting powder to no success as the oil kept on coming even after an hour or two. I wasn’t sure about how to use this product as a primer, setting or its own as a foundation. At first i tried it as a setting product and use it after a tinted serum by applying it with my fingers as suggested and it didn’t do magic for me. I’m still oily after a couple of hours but it does looks not as oily as on the side i put on a setting powder. The next day i tried it as a primer also using my fingers before i apply my tinted serum. Still not amazed me. The next day i tried it again as a primer with my fingers too but i warm it up with my fingers first before i tap and blend it on my face, after that i apply a setting powder with a puff then i apply my tinted serum and it really does its magic ! I still apply a light touch of gucci setting powder with a puff after my tinted serum and cream products before moving on to powder bronzer and blush. After that i spray a face mist so the powder won’t look too heavy and after hours I don’t look oily as i always am. This never happens to me. Definitely gonna purchase the full translucent size after this !"

I have found that it works best if I let the product dry completely, and the drying time is why I didn't give it 5 stars. Once I put this on I usually have to wait at least 15-20 mins before I can put on the rest of my makeup. I may have to use more than most people to fill in my pores, though, so that may not be everyone's experience. Once it dries my skin looks amazing, almost ethereal. It truly looks like a filter is on my face because you can hardly see the pores on my nose at all. There is little to no oily breakthrough after several hours, which is unheard of for me.

HOWEVER the first time I used it, upon removal of my makeup I had a MASSIVE allergic reaction. I used all of my other regulars with it and thought “ok maybe i over-exfoliated the day prior or something”.  I then tried wearing it again a few weeks later just to rule out any other possible causes. This time I wore it on its own just with moisturizer, a little bit of my usual undereye concealer, usual setting powder, and usual bronzer.  Upon removal 6 hours later, I had the same awful bright red bumpy hive-like texture and it was back and worse than ever. And it’s so strange to me because in 15 years of wearing tons of mostly full coverage products, and powerful skincare products, I have never ever ever had a reaction to any product.   I’m sooo sad over it. I really loved the application and the way it wore, and the coverage was beautiful—you would never know my skin was flaring up underneath until I removed it."

You have to know how to use, how much to use and you’re good to go as it’s not like anything else.  It rocks my world, it stays on my face, it plays well with my westman atelier cream bronzer, my Gucci powder bronzer, any of the hourglass ambient powder, charlotte tilbury pressed powder, the list goes on. It doesn’t slid, and I’m a girl who uses the nars matte foundation, and still crease.  I’ll say it again, you have to get used of how to apply it, you need the tiniest amount ever. If I have any red pimples or my nose is a little more red, I do go in with a little concealer but only when I want a more makeup look.  GET IT!!"

It blurs your skin and keeps my skin matte all day. I’ve never used it over foundation like it also suggests because that just seems weird to me. But if you’re an oil slick like me use this under foundation as a primer with Este lauder double wear foundation on top and your makeup will not budge.

I also feel like I have to use a lot to cover my face. And, I don’t think this is the type of product you want to use your fingers to apply with. Like I said, this product is like butter (which is a good thing I guess), and it takes a lot to build up but it’s also messy. Either way, I’m going to buy this again. I just don’t know if I’ll be using it often."

I think this makes a great base product if you like something light coverage for everyday use - but with a concealer you could use this for a more 'full coverage makeup' look. I blended it out with a foundation brush and was impressed at how easy it was to distribute and blend - can't wait to try it out with a beauty blender next.

These things keep me matte for 2-3 hours, tops. After that I am blotting my face multiple times a day and powdering every chance I get. Its been an absolute struggle, embarrassing at times....I didn't think anything would work and had begun to accept my skin was always going to be like this over the last few years. I had enough of trying to fight it...  I can't remember how I heard of this product but its incredible!! I got the universal shade to use as a primer. I scoop out a tiny pea sized amount and smooth it all over my face but concentrate most of it on my t-zone. I use the smallest bit of powder to set my face and then use powder again around 4-5 pm. Thats it!!!!!   I will say this is definitely not for dry skin....they should market it specifically for oily skin and maybe create a different formulation with less of Upsalite to cater to normal/oily skin folk. Even with moisturizer and sunscreen underneath (plus having oily skin) I could feel its drying effects on my skin. I have only used it twice so far and definitely will be prepping with more thicker, moisturizing products underneath. I am totally okay with that prep because for the rest of the day I can forget about my greasy face, thats such a relief. My makeup lasts longer, looks better...I can plan out a full day and know that I wont look like a greasy mess. I couldnt stop staring at my face and checking my skin in the mirror every few hours, surprised to see no oil.   This is a miracle product!! Thank you for making this Danessa Myricks!!!"

This stuff truly has a bizarre, albeit beautiful, texture that literally shape-shifts on your skin. This stuff smoothed out my texture and large pores, neutralized redness, and appears to be soaking up oil. It didn't dry out my dry to normal ares at all. If you have flakiness, yes it will cling to that but what makeup doesn't? You have to have the right skincare underneath, which is key to making any makeup work.   I could see how this would be misused but I also think maybe people are making it too complicated. I grabbed this from my UPS guy, opened the box, and lightly smeared a very small amount on my face with my fingers. Nothing fancy. This was in the middle of my day. I had no makeup and a lot of moisturizer/oil because I was home for the day letting my skin recover from the work week (and my photo evidence reflects that 😜). I'm sure it could be used with a good brush. Don't overthink it and don't feel the need to use a huge amount. Build as needed.   I'll see how this absorbs oil going forward. My skin is VERY oily; so oily that nothing stops it except for Botox. My expectations for oil absorbency are never met and I'm used to that. My first impression is just that it looks like my skin but better and it really suits my textured skin without looking fake or overdone."

I used it as primer, applied with my fingers under the Haus Labs TriClone foundation and it slid around and took forever to get all the slippery mix of balm and foundation into something that resembled a polished look. As a busy working mom, I do not have time for this much care and handling to make it work.  I set it with Laura Mercier powder which helped with the shine. However, I had to be careful all day not to touch my face as any slight pressure would restart the slip and slide of makeup and left blotchy uneven spots on my face. It just never settled/dried down. I tried applying as primer under foundation, as a setting balm over foundation, using my fingers, a brush, etc. over the course of a week and nothing worked. I finally returned to a store and the cashier off handedly mentioned that she had processed a lot of returns for this product. Maybe it works for younger people or people with dry skin, but this is not for me. The search continues for the perfect primer."

That being said, I've never seen my makeup look worse than when using this product, and it's weird. I got the universal shade to use as a primer and experimented, using less and less (and I used very little from the beginning) each time I tried it to see if that would help, but it didn't. My makeup caked and creased in ways I'm not used to seeing. It completely gathered around my nose and in any fine lines, it made everything I used on top of it much harder to blend, and anything put over it looked patchy. I always prime my eyes with my matte face primer and my eyeshadow also did not blend out easy or well at all (Natasha Denona) like they always do. Also, I'd be careful using this as an eye primer if you use liquid liners or water-activated liners. I could not get my cake liner to glide and stick to my eye and realized like an idiot this primer is heavily silicone based, so the primer was repelling the water in the liner. Your mileage may vary if you're using liquid or cream products, as I use all powder products (including powder foundation) with the exception of my concealer, but I felt like it even made my concealer look bad. My skin felt balmy all day, which further contributed to the moveability of my makeup. In fact, my mascara flaked a little and instead of being able to brush off the flakes, when I went to brush them my skin was so balmy and moist (but still matte which was weird) that the flakes liquified and caused a bunch of black streaks under my eyes. It also made it harder to wash my makeup off. Ultimately, yes, it did blur pores and it did keep me almost completely matte by the end of the day, solving two major issues for me. However, it created a host of other issues. Enough for me to say, even as a SUPER oily-skinned person, I'm going to pass and go back to my old primer."

For me, it's been a great replacement for all my liquid foundations and goes on quickly and easily.  It also blends seamlessly.  It is important to do really good skin prep because it is not a wet product, so you'll want to make sure you're using a really good moisturizer under it and give that moisturizer time to settle into your skin before you apply.  I spent an entire day out and about and never needed to touch up or reapply it, so I'm definitely a believer. The coverage level is perfect.  It's light without giving me the over the top, glowy appearance like a skin oil or a liquid foundation would give.  As much as I like that glowy, shiny look, it's not practical in the humidity where I live, so this product is a great way to replicate that look with a product that better suits the weather.  I also have the universal shade and it's perfect for days when I don't want to have on a full face, but my skin just needs a slight bump in appearance."

You can see the balm finish in the hand swatch, just applied. It turns into a natural-matte finish once it sets. I do my eye makeup while the product sets. Gorgeous packaging which is also recyclable. Great ingredients: it has hyaluronic acid, olive derived squalane and upsalite. It is a vegan, cruelty free, gluten-free product It is a Black Owned brand. CONS: It did nothing to disguise my pores under foundation. It made the pores slightly less apparent without foundation but only because of the natural matte finish, that could be achieved with any matte setting or finishing powder and better results with other pore refining products (like Tatcha Silk Canvas or Tarte Timeless Smoothing Primer). I never go without foundation so adding the balm does little for me. I am sharing my honest and authentic opinion as a Sephora Beauty Insider Community Ambassador"

I also love the packaging as it's easy to use & clean.

I always have to blot least once when I put make up on, I’ve gotten used to it. But this leaves my skin so beautiful and oil free all day long. Im amazed. I paired this with the Kosas Revealer foundation, a foundation I wasn’t able to make work for me when it first came out due to how hydrating it is and how it transfers easily on my due to my oils. But once I put this yummy balm underneath as a primer, I went 10+ hours looking flawless. No wearing, no transferring, no splotchiness nothing! That’s with the fact that I was even jumping around at SkyZone, sweating. And because of that, I decided to hold off on blotting just to see how my makeup would look at the end of the night. Once I got home, it was as if I could keep with wearing that days makeup for another 5+ hours if I wanted! Will forever repurchase. I will say though, I apply this with my hands like a regular primer so it can get into my skin thoroughly. I have yet to try it with a brush or other ways as others have mentioned."

Also, if you are pale and worried about how dark the product looks online, it actually blends out lighter than it appears in the packaging, so if you were hesitant like me, you might be surprised by how well this matches your skin.

I looked like a 90s goth even though the foundation looked 1/2 a shade darker than me in the pan. There can be some pluses for some people (not me). 1) Some reviewers had settling in their lines. I didn't have that and I usually get that in my smile lines. I'm in my early 40s so I have smile lines and under eye lines. There was no settling in either. 2) The coverage is a solid medium.

As I applied it I watched my skin texture smooth out and my redness decrease as if I was watching a photo app filter being applied to my face.  I’m convinced someone sold their soul for the recipe to create this miracle product.  I’m very happy with the universal version but I can’t wait till my skin tone is back in stock to try that too.  I genuinely don’t need it cause the universal is perfect for me, but I’m mesmerized and curious.  If this ever gets discontinued you’ll find me revolting outside Sephora with a pitchfork."

For being so heavy it isn't even full coverage, it's medium. Building it to full coverage makes it look and feel even worse. It looks horrible on its own, which is how everyone on tik tok is saying it should be worn. For the dewy look but honestly if I didn't set it with powder it would rub off everywhere. I will say that this foundation does look better over time. After an hour or more it starts to set in and act less like a greasy mask, but it still cracks and separates in some areas. I'll tolerate it given I've tried it so many times to see which way it will work for me, so I can't return it anymore. I also only kept this because it's an EXACT color match for me."

The product looked patchy, attached to areas of my face that were dry, enhancing the appearance of pores and looked streaky I had to play around with my face for far longer than I normally would. I couldn’t build the product neither and it had little coverage.   However I do believe this is a great product for skin as I saw it does have some benefits but this would be perfect for people who have very clear, bright and healthy skin who are looking for a light coverage to already enhance their clear non textured skin."

The formulation of this product is perfect for these settings & especially for oily skin.

As a Makeup Artist who works with a lot of different skin tones the translucent is my staple as it works on literally any skintone! This product is also great for male grooming as it's undetectable irl & in flash photography. For personal use I'd recommend using the provided applicator to scoop/apply the product & the use of your fingers/hands to warmup/blend the product into the skin.

Now, I can’t really wear it alone as a foundation, i use it as a primer. And that’s because it doesn’t look the best on textured skin (dry, flaky, or large pores.) if it’s used alone.

I really like the way it applied with fingers and with a damp beautyblender; didn't try a brush. You can build up coverage a bit if you have any redness.

Superpower ingredient Upsalite really does wonders for smoothing out skin and keeping it matte without the need for additional powdering. The balm easily melts into the skin using your fingers, or create blended and buildable coverage using a sponge or brush. A little goes a long way and mixes well with all DMB products. Universal makes a wonderful primer with invisible matte finish. With the all the shades, there are so many possibilities from eyes, lips, under-eye brightening, contour, complexion, etc.  TIP: Keep the container closed when not in use and click your spatula back into place after every use."

The yummy skin balm is definitely an innovative cream powder that delivers a soft and natural coverage to your skin without leaving it greasy and or heavy. It is really like what Danessa said, “You’re skin but yummier”  The compact is beautifully package, light weight, and easy to slip into your purse. The balm is also great for touch up throughout the day as well, if you need it.  ***Great tip: if you want to achieve a beautiful and natural glass skin, scoop a bit of the products and a tiny small drop of the DMB Beauty Oil and or your favorite hydrating face oil, and then mix it. Once it is mix nicely, use your finger tips to blend the product onto your skin. If you’re not comfortable using your finger tips, swap it out for a round/triangular face puff. Press the face puff light onto your skin. Then. Lightly set it with powder and you’re skin will look like glass.   Good Luck and I know you’ll love this product as much as I do!"

It blurs and smoothes the skin without adding a lot of coverage, so its great to throw on for a no makeup day if you want to look a little more polished. I also like to use it as a primer, as it is very smoothing, and can cover up some of the rough patches of texture I sometimes get on my T zone. My one issue is that the formula is silicone-heavy (hence the blurring filter-like finish) which can clog my pores and make me breakout if I use it too frequently. Not everyone has this issue, so it may work wonders for you, but its definitely something to keep in mind if you are acne prone."

I also love the lightweight packaging which is a must when you’re carrying a full kit!"

It is an entire face product.  First and foremost, make sure you prep your skin the way it needs to be prepped.  I have normal/dry skin, so I prep with the Yummy Glow Serum and sometimes the Danessa Myricks Beauty Oil.  When I first used this product, it did look dry on the areas of my face that were not properly hydrated.  After prep, literally go to town with it!  I love using shade 5 for the center of my face (I’m Danessa Myricks Yummy Serum Foundation 14W, Vision Cream Cover N6, NARS Cadiz, Pat McGrath M17, and Fenty Beauty 330) and shade 7 or 8 for the perimeter of my face.  I love using the Universal shade for a no makeup, makeup look when I want to smooth my pores and have a flawless complexion.  I love to mix the universal shade with my more dewy foundations so they can last longer on the skin AND look better on the skin.  I have used the universal shade  as my setting powder as well.  I’ll take a dense brush and tap it over my foundation to set it.  I will also take the Universal shade and mix it with my cream blushes/bronzers so they can last longer and blend even better into the skin.  I will use the universal shade as an eye primer (for oily eyelids), in my brows as a primer, and I have even used shades 7 and 8 on my eyes as eyeshadow and on my lips as a lip color and lip smoother.  The possibilities are truly ENDLESS with this product!  It is by far one of my favorite makeup products hands DOWN!"

I dare anyone who had a bad experience to try it that way ❤️  It truly takes care of all my makeup insecurities I’ve had with other products!   This is the only product to help my makeup last through the hot icky summer ! Also great for my fine lines which usually crease quickly with other primers ! When I’m feeling lazy the shaded balm powders are perfect without foundation they cover my dark marks beautiful while making my skin still look natural for a quick do and go look paired on top of the yummy skin serum is a match made in heaven !"

I'm not a huge makeup person, so I was hesitant to buy this but I am SO GLAD I did! I usually blot my face every hour, but I went about 8 hours without needing to. I did have to play around with using a little vs a lot, but found a good balance. I do get shiny, but it's a nice glow (which I've never had before!) Really wish I had this when I was younger and first learning how to do makeup."

This balm is a multi-tasked that can be used as a primer, a non-powder setter or as you complexion base. I’ve tested it as a primer and complexion base and it’s remarkable! It’s formulated with Upsalite, which helps too absorbs moisture, and it’s super blurring so it gives a soft focus finish. When I use this as my complexion base, I do set it with powder because although it does settle down to a velvety powder finish, it’s still I cream formulation that will transfer on hands or other absorbent surfaces, if not locked in with an actual setting powder. You can build coverage with this, using a denser brush, think Sephora Pro brush 70 or 80. My favorite way to use it, is as a primer! I’m oily/ combo, especially in the summer, and that fact that the upsalite continues to absorbs oils while it smooths over pores and the balm provides some color, it evens out my complexion, which results in me using less foundation! I even bought the Universal to use in my kit, as a primer because it’s THAT GOOD!! I will provide photos of me using it as a primer and as a foundation."

I use it in place of foundation and apply concealer and powder under my eyes only. I wore it today for nine hours with setting spray and went for a two mile walk. My makeup still looked good enough that I didn’t feel the need to touch up! It also blurs my pores and texture better than any other product I’ve tried. I am obsessed!"

			"review_text": "This is my new holy grail/ staple product. As I have approached my 30's my skin has become more oily/combination. Especially my forehead and t-zone. I'm always needing to powder my eyebrows and forehead even when I wear even the most matte foundation within the first couple of hours. Over the last several days I have used this under different foundations with different finishes and in this brutal summer weather to truly put this to the test. I have not had to powder my face once! Even my eyebrows don't start to get that glossed over look and stay feathered. I think the key to using the translucent shade is to use small amounts in concentrated areas, work it in with your fingers, and give it a minute to sit and sink into your skin before you apply your makeup as it can feel really slick and greasy when you first apply it. I've never seen my foundation or brow pencil look patchy with this method. 8 hours later, my face literally looked like I just finished my makeup. To all of my oily friends, you need this!"

I use it on no or minimal-makeup days to keep my oils down and blur my pores a bit - it makes a huge difference on my nose especially. It is pricey but you don't have to use very much; I mainly use it in my T-zone as a standalone oil controller or a primer. It really helps balance my skin, which tends to look pretty awful with any kind of setting powder no matter what and avoid that greasy but somehow also dry/cakey look I often struggle with avoiding. Anything really matte looks bad on my skin even with good prep, but anything too skinlike usually winds up just not tolerating my oils well and this does substantially help with that.  I will say, I don't think that I'm actually the oiliest person out there and I WAS expecting more oil control than it actually gives. I don't want to discount what it does - it really does help in a way that's much more elegant on my skin than a powder or matte products, and it helps enough that I will likely repurchase even for the price, but it's not the oil-absorbing miracle I was hoping for. I do still need to powder through the day, but less so which looks much nicer on me. Also, the packaging is lovely and very sturdy/robust - I just wish it was refillable! It's not a ton of product in there so I really wish it was possible to buy a replacement pan and not have to toss the whole thing. It feels so wasteful to have to get rid of the whole big component. I've also noticed the product can be a bit funny about pilling if I try to apply over certain skincare or blend certain products over it."

I used to use the Laura M setting powder, but I find that I need to retouch my T-zone every hour. But this product makes me forget that I even have combo skin! The texture is very unique, and it does take some getting used to. I use a small amount (there’s a reason for that), apply on my T-zone, spread it outwards using my fingers, and then try to blend it out with a sponge.  Cons: Maybe it’s because it used a tinted balm, but it clings on to dry patches and doesn’t blend well!! I don’t have a lot of texture, I moisturize religiously, I prep my skin (primer and all), and I don’t use a lot of product, but I can’t seem to figure out why it would look patchy and it won’t blend no matter how much I try. I’ve tried applying it with a brush, but that almost looks worse. You don’t really notice it unless you look very closely, but it bothers me that it doesn’t give me the same seamless look as a setting powder would have.  Last thoughts: I think the patchiness issue is mainly because it’s tinted, so I went ahead and bought the translucent version to try. I’m really hoping that that fixes it. I also don’t use it as a foundation, but more as an oil-control product. I’m genuinely surprised that it works for my oily forehead and I really love the product for that, now I just have to figure out how to make it look not patchy (and I’m hoping the translucent balm will solve it)"

This balm powder seemed to have good feedback so I took the plunge because I have old acne scar texture, some enlarged pores and discolouration. I thought this might offer a layer of blurring action for a more flawless face. The word powder is very misleading. It goes on like a wet oil like paste, it’s not thick mind you, but I did not find that it dries down at all to a powder finish. I needed actual powder to set it. Yes it offers a thin layer of cover up but you will still need to add a concealer on top to really cover up problem areas. I found it looks kind of flat on the face and not skin like -more mask like. I also have KVD good apple cream foundation in the compact. KVD covers better and kind of goes on in the same way if you use very little it spreads. But unlike the KVD I found this blurring balm powder just sat on top of my skin and looked cakey and smeared and became patchy as the day went by. My other foundations are way better as far as longevity and coverage. I used this under like a primer and over a very light foundation as well as under a foundation powder. Honestly, I looked worse with this. I don’t have oily skin I lean more normal/combo and I did not find this controlled oil in my T zone. It has a nice light texture on the skin and maybe on darker skin tones it won’t look so flat or obvious, but on my skin this made me look like I was wearing makeup and did nothing to blur anything. Just an extra cakey layer on me so I returned it. Has a weird chemical smell to it. 2 stars for great packaging with the spoon though!"

Like, if you blotted the top of a Little Caesar’s pizza and compared it to whatever I may used to blot my face mid afternoon, you honestly probably wouldn’t see much of a difference. I’ve always felt like I needed a squeegee for my face. Anyway, I digress… I don’t know what kind of magic was used to create this balm, but it is AMAZING! My face stays matte while wearing this, with a little oil showing through maybe 9-10 hours in. Also, it’s super easy to apply and feels so light on the skin. This is great light coverage for those “no makeup” days, and I can see the Universal shade being great for anyone needing an oil-control base, or just oil control without anything on top. I highly recommend for any oily-skinned people like me!"

I also use as an Under-eye primer, no creases (chef's kiss) and I also use as a lip primer by just putting it on the outline of my lips, no bleeding from my liner, glosses, or lipsticks. Although it doesn't work too well as an on-lid eye primer for me, because I have slightly hooded eyes and they get oily.  So I stick with my Smashbox eye primer. Overall, this has become my EVERYTHING to my base makeup. I will definitely repurchase both again."

I am using the Yummy Skin Serum Foundation in 9N and it works well with my neutral medium light tan skin.  I have light melasma (hyperpigmentation) on my upper cheekbones that the Yummy Serum Foundation does not cover.  I decided to try the Yummy Powder Balm in 4 as my powder concealer.  I would say the balm powder has more of a brightening effect and it is a teenie teenie bit lighter then the 9N serum.  It's the perfect color and with the brightening effect it looks really nice on my upper cheekbones.  I use a dense flat top kabuki brush and use patting motions to get the full coverage from the balm and only use it on my upper cheekbones (over the hyperpigmentation and Yummy Serum). I use a dry beauty sponge to push in the balm that's on my cheekbones.  When I do this I go from an oily look to more of a satin your skin but better look.  The dry sponge absorbs and lifts the oily look from the balm but does not remove my coverage. I use a cream blush from Melt and use a flat kabuki brush to pat it onto my cheekbone.  I find setting the balm with powder makes me look I have thick foundation on so i never use powder on my cheek area or under my eyes but I do powder everywhere else with the Charlotte Tillsbury powder (compact) in the color medium.  I have the glow without the greasy oily look.  I use Pat Mcgrath Skin Fetish LM14 under my eyes.  It's so hard for me to find full coverage foundation or concealers that do the job without the look of heavy makeup, but I have found it with this combo.  Danessa is working for me.  I'm sold!  I find doing a last blotting of enter face with a paper towel removes the excess, and as the hours go on I wont have to blot so soon if I do this right before walking out the door."

Initially I was SURE I was going to after reading, researching the product & reviews, it SEEMED to be something comparable to a product I love/use everyday already - Nudies Tinted Blur Sticks by Nudestix - bcz they’re just so easy to apply/blend; they’re forgiving, versatile & blurring. I love them esp when I’m tan. So I kinda went into this thinking they’d offer similar blurring/coverage qualities. But this works nothing like the Nudestix - at least not on my skin.  If you have pores, lines, dry patches, even if you have peach fuzz on the surface of your skin - BEWARE!! - bcz it WILL accentuate ALL OF IT - which is the total OPPOSITE effect of what the Nudestix do for me. I felt like this product accentuated/magnified stuff I couldn’t even see before application. It actually “pools” & sits in pores, it “catches” on any dry patches you may have & it certainly doesn’t blend in & become 1 w/the skin - it sits on top & my GOODNESS it is VERY OBVIOUS. The formula feels like a very slippy, greasy formula & once it’s on, it looks like it’s been sitting on the skin for hours bcz it also looks like it’s separating & breaking down (similar to how a medium to full coverage foundation looks after hours of wear & oil production breakdown) — I don’t know how else to describe it. I don’t think I’ve ever had a product behave or look this way on me before.  Sadly, I can’t even “make it work” but I am seeing people who are loving it & it appears to work well on a VERY PARTICULAR type of skin - no peach fuzz, no pores or texture - just very plump/smooth, texture-free (basically perfect) skin. Should that ever change for those people, there’s another product out there they can try - the Nudestix :) Personally & I’ll stick w those."

It makes absolutely no difference how I apply it, what I apply it with or how I prep my skin. If I had to describe what it’s like, it’s like trying to blend a slippery greasy tinted cream over driveway gravel. My skin has never been compared to driveway gravel until I tried this. Id say a person needs to have VERY smooth, plump, texture-free (basically perfect) skin with no texture or pores if this is going to look nice. But even then, I just wonder how it can blend & blur if it accentuates stuff that doesn’t even show up otherwise! I’m so sad about this bcz I was SURE it was going to be at least a similar (but hopefully better) version of the Nudestix but I was so wrong. I use my Nudestix everyday in the summertime too - I’ll stick with those. This is a hard pass. I’d include a photo but I’m hoping it’s not necessary after the description I gave."

My skin lasted longer than usual,  2.5 hrs then I started to see the oil coming thru strongly so that was disappointing but I know stopping oils is almost impossible......NOWW...I got home and just dabbed some extra on my t-zone. It mattified and I went to lay outside for 2 hrs in the blazing heat, sweat was dripping down my arms , elbows , knees, neck. I was roasting I came inside...... and my face was completely matte. ...and the part that shocked me the most is that you can see where the sweat begins (where there was the least product near my scalp that I didn't touch up, and under my nostril where I missed ) LARGE BEADS OF SWEAT with a clear demarcation line. There is something to this stuff and if you can figure out how to work it either under or on top of your foundation or powders , setting or not setting it, some magic will happen .

I usually don't believe many foundation claims about helping oily skin because, in the end, many of them perform the same way. However, when I read that this has an ingredient that I have never come across before that helps with oil production, I figured it might be worth the risk to try. My makeup usually starts to melt and oxidize in a few hours. Anyway, I will tell you now that this is officially holy grail status. On the first try, after a few hours, my skin looked matte/natural and my makeup didn't oxidize at all. After several hours my skin was a little dewier but still, my makeup looked really nice... no oxidizing and also no crepiness or separation. The next day I was excited to try products that I normally can't wear.. like cream blushes and highlighters... and it worked out better than I imagined. I basically feel like I have different skin.. I can even use more emollient moisturizers under my makeup. As for coverage... I got shade 5 and it is a good match for me ( Mac Nc44, fenty 330, estee lauder 4N2/4w2). I layer it on for light coverage with my fingers. I will try a sponge next time because I heard that it's even better. Anyway, if you are oily, I highly recommend trying this.

			"review_text": "I rarely write reviews considering how many different foundations, BB creams, powders, and tinted moisturizers I've tried. This is unusual, but overall I really like it and will repurchase.  It feels lightweight, sinks into skin in a good way so it becomes undetectable, and actually looks like skin. It is a satin matte or natural look for me but I have combo skin with a very oily t-zone. I only use it on my t-zone and it really covers redness. I would usually choose the second lightest color but I'm glad I went for shade 3 because it is quite light and leans towards golden too even though it says neutral. It is definitely not orange on my skin. It does not oxidize and in fact looks a little lighter once it blends into skin. When you first apply, it feels a bit greasy but it dries down to a soft skin like finish and really keeps my t-zone from getting oily for hours but does not make it look dry or cakey which is often a problem with things that claim to control oil. I put it on at 6am on Friday. At 5pm I blotted my t-zone and reapplied and it still looked perfect at midnight. I have tried it with a bunch of different primers and over sunscreen and I find it works the best on just lightly moisturized skin. I would say the coverage is light to medium, but I'm using it mostly for a bit of redness and to hide large pores, which it does well.   I agree that it has an odd smell but if it works I can tolerate that. So far it has not broken me out. I have practically tried everything at all price points and I think this is the best there is since they discontinued my favorite - the original version of the Perricone MD no foundation foundation serum."

I have had trouble in the past with foundation breaking down by the end of the day, esp when we wore masks for work. So for the two years of the pandemic, I wore mostly powder foundation. This product was a great transition back to wearing more coverage when some of the restrictions lifted. I have worn it under a mask and found it still had fairly decent coverage without breakdown. I’ve also used it to set over a CC cream for more coverage and am impressed. Look forward to using it all summer.  And shade 4 is a perfect match for my light medium tan skin!"

First off, the odor/smell of this product is horrible, it reminds me of Halloween cream makeup or the white cream paste cover used in theatre. The odor is strong, synthetic, and chemical-smelling. I tested this over several days, with different combinations of prep and application methods: alone, over a moisturizer, and overtop a primer, and several methods (fingers, Artis palm brush, sponge). I found using the dense palm brush provided the most even and consistent coverage. The product did not work well overtop of only a moisturizer, but applied and wore the same overtop of bare skin and a primer (Tatcha liquid canvas). Long story short, this did not wear well on my skin throughout the day. It was drying and would settle into pores, fine lines, and cling to dry skin patches. I returned this product.

			"review_text": "It smells a little funny in an not-perfumed way.  It smells chemically?  But not the ew-gross-melted-plastic-or-rubber way that the Milk Hydrogrip primer smells to me.  This actually makes me think of the car wash, maybe like the wipes they sometimes give you for your steering wheel/console?  Definite evokes some sort of car wash essence or perhaps new car smell?  It's very blurring.  I got it to use as a primer for powder foundations hoping it'd be something to create a bit of a barrier between the powder and my skin since it claims to maintain hydration (someone once told me I had the driest skin they'd ever seen) plus add a little extra coverage since I consider powder foundation to be my light coverage foundation.  I can't say my skin feels less dry than normal, but I wore this today combined with BareMinerals original loose powder foundation and my mom asked me what foundation I was wearing because it looked so blurred and light.  I like it.  It's easy to put on with my fingers (my preferred base application method) and works well with my powder foundations.  I've also worn it on its own just to add a little something something to my face and that worked well.  I haven't tried it with my normal liquid foundation (Estee Lauder Double Wear), so I can't report back on that.  It works with the Estee Lauder pressed powder foundation though, so I expect it'd be fine with the liquid.  My only complaint is that the car wash smell is a bit unusual but I only get a whiff of that if I intentionally smell the pan, and it's not off-putting to me like the Milk Hydrogrip primer smell."

It gives just enough coverage whilst still looking like skin, and I found it did blur out the larger pores on my nose and cheeks. I tried applying this over my under eye concealer (Armani luminous silk) and it didn’t lift the concealer and set it beautifully without settling into fine lines when applied with fingers. There’s a learning curve to using this (hence the 4 stars instead of 5) and it didn’t work as a primer for me, but since switching up how I use it, it has now become my day to day base product."

I first used it as a primer after moisturizing, noticed right away that you can't use it with a brush because it will not give an even blend, tried with a beauty blender and while it blended, it soaked up too much product and finally realized that the best and only way to use this product is with ur fingers. The spoon is pretty but useless as the only way it worked for me was having it warm up by picking up the product with my finger.  I primed with it and was immediately impressed with how much it filled in pores, evened out skin tone and blurred my skin. I went on to use a light layer of Pat McGrath foundation (my normal daily foundation) with a beauty blender, still looked beautiful and more radiant than normal. I next used a tart concealer because I knew it would crease and I wanted to see if this would help a little and it did. I went over the concealer with this product first tapping it to get an even coverage and after using a beauty blender and I'm telling you that it made my concealer last all day, I even cried a little with my mother's day gifts from the kids and it still didn't budge. I was shocked that I could take a little on my finger and apply on top of my foundation, I just always used a beauty blender after to finish the job.  I would argue against the claims that it can be used as a foundation, I'm not sure about that but I have used it as a setting/finishing powder and as a primer and I'm just shocked with the beautiful results. The feeling and finish on its own is more like as if you used a primer and then a powder. I also can not express enough that no application worked for me outside of using my fingers first to warm it. For all those having issues with it, play around with it a little before throwing in the towel because I have dry skin and it gave me a radiant finish all day long.  I think this product is a serious game changer!"

Im struggle with how to use this product and have tried it multiple ways (primer, foundation, concealer, setting). So far the lightest layer as a foundation has worked but due to a shade issue, it might be better as a primer until I can get a darker shade. I do not like this under the eyes so definitely avoid as a concealer! Also, I’ve tried using brushes, my fingers and a sponge to apply and so far the sponge works the best for me. This is a product that needs to be really pushed into the skin but be careful because it does have quite a bit of pigment! Here’s the pros and cons:  Pros- definitely mattifying! This 100% helps me control my oils which is a struggle I constantly have with makeup products. Also, less is more with this product so you do not need much how ever you use it!   Cons: Too powdery of a finish and that is coming from someone who prefers a powder foundation to a liquid or cream. This leaves my skin looking more dry and textured at the beginning (even after my serum, moisturizer, sunscreen and auric glow lust primer). It does eventually “warm” up and look more natural but I prefer my initial application to look flawless. Lastly, I’ve noticed this color range runs lighter than the swatches show. I’m light with cool undertones so I’m recommended shade 1. Shade 1 is unfortunately too light and Shade 2 is too yellow. Im going to make shade 1 work but will definitely be looking at Shade 3 when it is inside Sephora."

My t-zone generates enough oil to moisturize a small village so when I heard what was promised from this balm I was way more hopeful than skeptical and it did not disappoint!   Day 1 I applied it over my serum and moisturizer using my fingers, then used a brush to even it out. First it was simply balmy. By the time I did my eyes and brows it was actually TOO matte. By the time I was fully dressed it had settled into close to perfection and STAYED THAT WAY! All day! I did the slightest blot in the evening and that’s only because I like matte matte. It blurred and matted aaaaallday! That said the consistency it dried down to was a bit odd.   So day 2 I’m trying it as a primer under Dior’s backstage foundation and it’s beautiful! This might just be the perfect perfect I was looking for. I think the difference is that light reflects off the foundation combo in a more natural way than it does off the balm. I also used it as an eye primer today (I consider this part of my t-zone) and so far so good! It’s been a few hours and I would normally have creasing by now. Oh I have wild pores. The only way they’d ever be fully blurred is if I got a new nose. That said with foundation worked better than without pore wise.   Tomorrow I will try it on top of YSL’s bare look tint which I usually wear as a tinted moisturizer with powder on top."

I applied w/ a foundation brush but It not only didn’t blur my skin, but also accentuated my pores and texture somehow.   Color: I got 3, and it looks VERY cool toned on my warm olive skin. I’m quite pale now, so I expected this to be slightly darker / warmer on me, but It actually applied brighter than in the pan, so much so that my face just looked pale, grayish pink at the end. I tried to warm it up w/ bronzer and blush, which is problematic because I’d have to bronze my entire face to cover up the ill-matching tone.

I think this will replace my blotting powders because it does such a good job at giving me a natural matte look while blurring my pores. Under foundation, it's like i don't even need to use a setting powder. I also tried it as an eye primer and i really works/ keeps my oily lids from creasing. Danessa is a genius and will be my HG product."

I used it as a primer for my foundation (wet n wild dewy, believe it or not), and I swear it took ten years off. Just to add this, I live in Georgia where it is very hot and humid and I have never had any luck with primer. I will update tonight on the longevity but so far it's absolutely amazing."

			"review_text": "Was really looking forward to this launch. Sounded innovative, borderline too good to be true but as we are all always looking for the best skin perfecting product, everything is worth a shot.  I have to admit that I'm confused about this product. I went in with the expectation that something that claims to be a primer, foundation, and powder might not be able to execute all of those claims flawlessly, but I can't help but feel that it doesn't really live up to any of the claims in a way that is effective? When worn alone, both the universal shade and the tinted shade seem greasy upon application, and dries to a powdery finish, but in the strangest way. Somehow reminds me of a cross between an Elf Putty Primer, Benefit Porefessional, and the original silicone Smashbox primer. It sets down in a sense, but still remains flexible, and I'm not sure if it's in a good way - it's like slippery powder? In the way that Silly Putty or that kinetic sand stuff aren't really solid and aren't really liquid. In the way that olives are sour and oily and meaty and juicy and dry and salty and sweet and sour all at the same time. It's too many things all at once.   Coverage is flexible, can be easily sheered out or built up. But on the skin, it floats on top, and somehow blurs in an unflattering way?  As a finishing powder or setting powder, it controls shine in the way a mattifying putty primer would, it dries down but remains slippy at the same time.  Not sure if I'm the problem here, or if this product is just too good to be true.  User error? Perhaps. Very innovative product? Definitely. Baffling? Perplexing? Confusing? Absolutely. Working for me? Not so much.  Extra points for being new and exciting, but I can't help but feel let down. This is like a first date with a handsome man that is rude to the serving staff... looks good in theory, but it's never going to work."

			"review_text": "Definitely blurring! It's basically a tinted primer and has a finish like a finishing powder. Extremely lightweight and not at all silicone like when i used a dense brush (NYX 37 buffing brush). I love wearing this alone and it covers my redness. It looks so natural, not cakey. By the time i wanted to touch up, i'm oily and hate a dewy nose, the wear down is graceful..Not patchy or splotchy. I would suggest that you regularly exfoliate because it did catch on a dry pimple lol."

			"review_text": "I just goth we in the mail today and couldn’t wait to try her out. Ok I was scared to try this product because Balms + Oily skin don’t go together. I am pleasantly surprised! Yes, this definitely feels like a balm but don’t let that scare you. It applies like a balm but dries down to a powder. I have no idea how that happens but it does. It was hard for me to pick a shade based on the example pictures on the site, and upon arrival it looks too dark but is my exact shade. I have not worn it long enough for a full wear test but first impressions are positive. The texture dries down (for lack of better words because “dry down” doesn’t adequately explain what happens) to a smooth finish that I would describe as light but buildable. I was able to get a medium coverage. This is the first time in a long time I’ve been excited about a complexion product and I recommend it to anyone who’s thinking about buying it"
