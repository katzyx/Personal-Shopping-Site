I actually didnt think it would as it pulled orange on me (as most colors do) in the shop. In more natural light it appears as a deep neutral red. The formula is fantastic. Its neither drying or moisturizing and it feels like its not even there. Even though its a dark red-brown it stays put and doesnt migrate around my lips. I can wear it without liner for this reason. I highly recommend this lipstick, especially for the price. It compares favorably to more expensive brands. Very luxurious."

Quite a disappointment on longevity after trying their matte formula lipstick because their matte formula really lasts. Another perfect nude satin finish lipstick that I love and lasts much longer is the YSL Caring Satin Lipstick in Nu Muse."

I applied it like 3 times and it doesn't show up at all. I found that really strange. I know Merit is supposed to be clean and sheer coverage, but these products are too costly to not even show up! Sadly I will have to be returning this shade. The packaging is nice, and it goes on super smooth, but I need SOME color payoff. I would only wear this if I wanted a bare bones no make-up make-up look."

I want to say that for starters I have a true medium complexion and due to the formula of this lipstick, the shade comes up lighter on you. What you see in the tube is not what you get on your lips and that actually makes me happy in this instance. It swatches to this sheer, beautiful natural brown... almost like the brown version of your lips but better. It's neutral which is a huge plus and in my case, lip liner was not needed. I also purchased the shade Baby and I am also in love with that shade. Baby is a bit light on me, but honestly it's not an issue. It doesn't wash me out, but it does look amazing when I use a light brown neutral lip liner. For reference, I used Nyx Nutmeg lip liner and it worked perfectly, so think along those lines if  you need a good liner with the shade Baby. I definitely recommend these lipsticks if you're looking for a good wash of color and want something moisturizing and light weight. These will now be my go to work lipsticks since I prefer glosses, lip butters and moisturizing lipsticks for work so I can just keep them in my pocket to reapply during a busy shift."

The color Baby is very close to my natural lip color (my skin tone is a fair olive). It's very neutral, with an almost gray tone, which may be a little concealer lips on some people. My only issue is that this shade emphasizes dryness in a way the other shade I own, Tiger, doesn't seem to do."

Color wise it's cooler than I typically like but still flattering. It doesn't have great staying power because of the balmy texture but that's to be expected.

I call this the perfect make-out lipstick because it doesn't have that annoying chalky base that dries up or bleeds. It's more balm-like and very hydrating, but not too slippy. It stays put without drying out. It's so goof-proof you can apply it without a mirror. The way it looks and feels, incredible. This is SO worth the price, and my dream brown lipstick that can be sheer-subtle or deeper depending on your mood. So it's actually a few lipsticks in one: the balm, the sheer barely there brown, the dark and sexy, and it's not going to ball up and look weird on your lips after eating, drinking, or kissing. A must have in dryer climates or on a kissing date. Get it, I wouldn't even bother with the lighter brown one Slip because you can get a light tone out of this, but also the benefit of a darker color in one. Win-win! LOVE IT!"

My sister is a redhead with more yellow/olive undertones and this is her favorite lip as well. I understand those who think this isn't worth it, at first pass this may seem like too little bang for your buck - but I have tried SO MANY light lipsticks, searching for a browny nude shade that is flattering for someone with my undertone and I've *never* had luck; browns are always too orange or pink or vampy. This cool brown is a true taupe/earthy tone and it looks good on every single person in my life."

I now have this in L'Avenue, Baby, Slip, Tiger, Cabo, and 1990, and the only one I don't super love is Slip (a little too pale of a neutral for my high contrast features, but that's not really a Merit issue so much as it is a personal preference). The formula is so comfortable to wear, easy to reapply even without a mirror, and the colors are really flattering on my pale neutral olive skin. I also find they work really nicely as a cream blush! I hope to see them release additional shades in the future, but I really don't see myself buying any other lipstick formula now that I have this one. I haven't had any of the colors break or become loose in the tube, so I think maybe that's a user error issue? Or I've just been really lucky with the ones I've gotten."

            "review_text": "I've been using 1990 for six months and I just bought Cabo because I love the formula. I haven't had any issues with it breaking but I am fairly gentle with my products. This is a very slippy, soft formula that creates a worn-in but moisturised look. It feels nice but it does bleed, which is why I don't think this formula will suit you if you prefer a crisp look. I haven't tried this lipstick with liner, but I do wear it to my office job and it does well with a put together look as well as a casual one, which is why I like it. This isn't like a Mac formula, for example, because it's sheer and the therefore you can wear it lightly for a sheer wash or build it up. But again, it does bleed and needs fairly frequent reapplying but I don't mind that since it doesn't dry out my lips like many lipsticks do.   1990 is a bit darker than I'd like for my skin tone, so I'll be using it as a fall/winter shade while I think Cabo is more complementary for a fair skin tone and can work year round. I do recommend swatching in store before you buy. I highly recommend it if you don't mind this specific type of formula!"

I had been eyeing these and grabbed them during the sale. So pleased i did. there are a few oter shades i may try in the future. These shades I bought, I would definately repurchase. Highly recommend to someone new to lipstick because the formula is so buildable. Even the darker shades are vdery wearable and less intimidating on the lip than in the bullet. And i forget to mention that I love the packaging. I love the Merit packaging esthetic in general, and these are awesome. I love how you can display with the shade visible. I am really impressed with these. They sit right next to my high end favorites and compete with some great formulas."

I find it doesn't cling to any dry patches on my lips, and it doesn't emphasize the fine lines on my lips. I have dozens of lipsticks on my top shelf and find I'm always reaching for this. It's such a great formula that feels incredible, doesn't dry out my lips, and is the perfect shade for my cool toned skin. I'm usually skeptical of clean beauty brands since they tend to expire really quickly, so I was kinda biased against this product but it's been a favourite for months now! Definitely recommend."

I got Tiger, loved it all season for a wintry brick, just got Cabo for a springy warm red. I prefer warm-based lip colors, which are tough to find - and this whole line delivers. Beware if you don't like warm tones. I love that you can wear these colors sheer, like a tinted balm, or at a juicy near-full opacity. The formula is also very hydrating for me. No cracking or flaking after wear. In fact, the morning after a night out in this lipstick, my lips feel distinctly soft. This has become my everyday lipstick."

I love this shade, which on me is much more berry than brown, more like a bright burgundy, and bolder than I expected. In my collection of favorite berry-brown lipsticks (Huda Habibi, Pat McGrath Flesh 7, Lisa Eldridge Painterly, Fenty Slip Shine Cookies & Cocoa) this one leans the most berry and has the brightest, boldest color. The bullet feels sturdy and I enjoy the paddle-like shape. The color has very good longevity too.

This is my honest and authentic opinion, as a Sephora Beauty Insider Community Ambassador.   WHAT I LIKE:  *  Lightweight  *  Hydrating *  Easy to apply - no need for a mirror  *  Goes on and feels like a balm  *  Leaves lips moisturized  *  Sheer but buildable coverage  *  Satin finish  *  Wears comfortably on the lips  *  Great wearable shade selection  AREA(S) FOR IMPROVEMENT: *  Would love to see more shades introduced into this collection   FYI / OTHER THOUGHTS: *  Vegan  *  Clean *  Cruelty Free *  Fragrance Free  BUY, BUY, BUY ud83dudecdufe0f or BYE-BYE ud83dudc4bud83cudffc?: *  An easy BUY, BUY, BUY for me! ud83dude0d"

The quality of this shade u201cBabyu201d is of the same quality of another big French brand with fancy, quilted handbags I have spent $40 on for years. That's not why I bought it. I saw the shade in an advertisement and I am a sucker for a fleshy pink/brown shade. I'm headlong for 60, and at my age, neutral is better. It also means I am concerned about the condition of my skin. This lipstick stays put for long enough to make me WANT to put more on. It's buildable. I like to swish it and brush it and perfect the shape of my lips when I go out. I just put one pass of it on each lip on Sundays when I just don't feel like making up. It looks so creamy because it is creamy. I will buy this again and again. This was a birthday gift to myself and it's the best gift I got. Thank you, Merit, especially for being Made In Italy!"

Also, the pictures online are NOT ACCURATE at all. I have light, very warm-toned skin, and am colour analyzed as a true spring. I bought Fashion, Cabo, and Tiger. Fashion pulls too cool-toned and purple on me and darkens my brightness / natural glow. It's not a soft berry as descripted and leans more plum-pink. Although a warmer a shade, Tiger is very brown IRL and also darkens my brightness. There is no trace of red on me. Cabo is perfect though -- a bright red orange.  Merit, please make more shades."

I have a thinner upper lip and a more fuller lower lip, so I find that red lipstick accentuates that, which is not a look that I really enjoy. I also find that red lipstick makes any discoloration on my face more prominent and noticeable. I have tried several different brands, like CT, Mac, NARS, Urban Decay, Dior, etc. I find them all disappoint me, either too drying or not enough pigment or too much pigment. Merit's Tiger was the entire package for me. It is as hydrating as a lip balm, and the colour is so beautiful. I can layer it without it looking thick and streaky. It really pulls together my look as well - I have dark brown hair and dark hazel eyes, so it completes my aesthetic. It will be my go-to lip product for fall and winter. Definitely give it a try. I will be getting Baby and Cabo next."

The first issue I had with these products is the scent. It's that sent that makes your throat feel dry for hours once you apply. A very subtly but oignant scent in the throat. Also, I live in Canada. It is a cooler season here. And my lip product still broke even when I didn't turn it too far up or apply intense pressure when applying. This is so unfortunate as I love the texture and consistency of this lip product. I can overlook the flaws for now for the formula, but I don't know if I'll repurchase."

However, the colors in person as significantly different than shown on the site! Though I'm not sure it's their fault as I also watched quite a few YouTube videos. The two shades I bought, Tiger and L'Avenue, are much browner than they appear here. If I just saw Tiger I'd never think to refer to it as a red. It looks straight up like a rusty warm brown to me. Similarly, L'Avenue hardly looks berry at all to me. I was hoping for something a bit brightened like Black Honey, but again this pulls very very brown and also quite deep. I think these are good if you're going for a 90s look, but I like a bit of brightness to my lip shades to brighten up the complexion and these are lacking in that. It's a bummer because I hate returning used products!"

L'avenue is perfect for a slight blot on the lips for someone who wants to feel put together, natural, and work appropriate with their makeup."

It is almost the same color as my lips - almost.  But it is a hair lighter - not too light though!  It doesn't give concealer lips and it actually leans more on the cool-toned side than an actual neutral which is what I love about it!  It's the perfect lip to wear with a bold eye look or smokey eye.  The formula is phenomenal.  Easy to wear and has a satin finish but doesn't wear off too quickly.  But when it does wear off it does so with grace.  I also have the shade 1990 and that is another favorite lip color - if you are afraid that it will be too deep (on lighter skintones) - it won't be.  It can be applied with a sheer color with just a couple swipes or built up, but it never gets too dark.  The only issue is that these lipsticks tend to break easily!  The warmth from being in your pocket can be enough to have it break.  And definitely don't leave it in your car on a warm day.  I have broken 2 of the 1990 lipsticks so far.  But the formula and these colors are so nuanced that it is worth it and they still get 5 stars!  Try shade Baby before it goes out of stock again!   ...  P.S. I have Dior lipsticks.. Givenchy... Gucci... as well as Milani, Loreal, Maybelline... Mac, Makeup By Mario, and the list goes on.  THESE lipsticks are my favorite formula."

I do wish they were a bit longer lasting but they're vert moisturizing so i guess that makes it hard to achieve. I would describe it more as a very tinted lil balm but i don't really mind it, makes it a great everyday lipstick for when you don't wanna wear alot of makeup."

This lipstick literally feels like a hydrating lip balm and beautifully pigmented lipstick in one. It's really hydrating yet also light and has great staying power. It's probably the most I've spent on a lipstick but I think it is totally worth it. The color 1990 is also beautiful and the perfect amount of brown yet not too stark. I'd love to try Tiger next."

Also if you have naturally pigmented lips these will probably translate differently on you than someone with light colored lips like me. I was worried 1990 would be too dark because it is described as dark brown. In the tube yeah but on the lips it's not too dark on my fair skin. I most usually don't think you have to pay high prices for lipstick (except luxury brands usually nail down those murky, unusual shades) but this is very worth the price.

            "review_text": "First thing I want to say is the packing is STUNNING and makes this lipstick feel much more expensive than it is. It is satisfyingly heavy in the hand but not bulky. The colored acrylic lid looks much nicer to me than just clear acrylic and they style of the case is just not something you see often which definitely makes this feel special and unique. Now on to the colors, feel and wear. I have 2 colors: Slip and Baby.  Slip is a lovely neutral leaning warm soft brown. Because of the formula and how thin it is, I can get the desired opacity without going overboard. I have light to light-med neutral/warm olive undertones with very pigmented lips which means browns, especially ones with a very heavy white base come off odd looking and too stark. Even with lip liner you can still see where my lip color is around the edges and it makes them look sickly or like there is a rash. Because this formula starts very sheer and can be built easily, I don't have that issue. And it's emollient so there isn't a lot of tug when applying and doesn't feel heavy when you build it up. And growing up in the late 90s/early 00s, it lets me relive that love of brown-neutral lips. It very much reminds me of  the long discontinued Bonne Bell lip gloss in Cappuccino, just warmer and thinner. Baby is a neutral pink with some beautiful dusty rose mixed in. After some swatching and comparing, it isn't EXACT as Merit is a bit deeper and the finish isn't matte, it is a very close dupe to CT Pillow Talk. And while I love CT, it is a heavier formula and a matte finish which has its time and place but I'm finding I prefer shiny, glossy, hydrating lip products more than anything that is matte. You definitely do not need both but I am not mad I have them both. I did deduct 1 star because Slip is not staying upright in the bullet. I'm not sure if it is due to melting a bit in transit or just the softness of the shade, but it is frustrating. Gonna try letting it fully set in the freezer and hope that helps"

Because two of the three colors I bought, 1990 and Slip, have broken inside their packaging. I have been an avid lipstick wearer for years, and this has never happened to me. Perhaps it's due to the balmy nature of the lipstick. However, that then defeats the purpose of something you can reapply on the go. The packaging is beautiful and sturdy. Apparently, the lipstick bullet itself it not. It is really, really a shame, as the formula and the colors are unique and beautiful. Maybe I just had bad luck."

I have several other lipsticks I prefer much more and decided to return this one. If you don't mind a strong vanilla scent and a drier lipstick that is very faint maybe you'll like it.

It's a true dusty pinkish (emphasis on the u201cishu201d) nude, it goes on smoothly and doesn't feel drying. Staying power could be better but I like that it's balmy and subtle, but buildable. I prefer products that are more translucent. This is not an opaque lipsticku2014but it isn't supposed to be.   Baby is great for everyday, and when you want to make an eyeshadow look the center.   90s: it's brownish! I like it. Not sure what else to say! It doesn't run too cool imo, so there's not a risk of looking gray-ish. But not too dark on me, and works for a neutral look. It's buildable, too, but starts off sheer (a plus in my book). Good for a little bit of an edgy vibe.   L'avenue: reminds me a bit of an old urban decay shade called bruise, but this one is more muted and brown-based (bruise was more berry). This one is to me a more mature, classic shade (versus the urban decay anyway), which I love. Subtle yet distinctive. Great for eveningsu2014though each of these shades could really work for any occasion, I tried to capture what I think the u201cvibeu201d felt like.   Main pros: wearable, buildable, versatile shades. Love the colors in this collection. Fresh yet classic!!!, balmy/not drying, comfortable, and did I mention it has beautiful packagingu2026so gorgeous.   Main cons: not long lasting"

I love Cabo for going it, it's literally the perfect sort of 90s-ish red-orange. And Slip is a beautiful neutral that I also love for dinner or nighttime for a trendier/edgier look. Baby will be my go-to daytime/work lip now."

I imagine it would be beautiful on someone pale.   Formulation was ok!

It's a such a lovely brick red color that goes on sheer so it's nothing like the other brick red I own in my collection. I'm definitely going to be grabbing more shades in the future!"

The shade and finish are exactly the same swatched beside each other except when on the lips, the Merit feels lighter and more comfortable and is longer lasting than the Charlotte Tilbury.  PLUS, the price point is WAY BETTER with the Merit.  You get more than double the product for $7 CAD LESS than the Charlotte Tilbury.  Highly recommend this formula of lipstick for those who don't normally like wearing bullet lipsticks.  This formula is truly special."

But my beautiful lipstick is SO fragile. I don't even want to use it anymore because I'm scared the product will completely fall out. The third or fourth time I used it, it felt like it was moving a bit, even though I was quite gentle. I have a few other lipsticks from other brands like Nars (even some drugstore lipsticks) and I have never had this problem. If this lipstick did not move around and smudge the wall of the tube I would give it 5 stars. I am in love with everything about it, the formula, the scent, the packaging, and especially the colour. I'm not sure what to do because I can't even return it for a new one. I waited a couple of weeks to try it out and then I only wore it a few times since getting it, so it's past the return date. I saw one other review saying something similar so maybe it's a bad batch? I don't know. I am considering using a lip brush but it just makes things more complicated. I want to be able to just throw this in my bag and go somewhere. Also, I should mention, that I never had it in any kind of heated area or sunlight. I keep it in my drawer and my room is on the cooler side. Does anyone know if there's a way to fix this? Is this happening to others as well or just me and that one other person? I really wanted to buy another colour but if it's going to be the same then I won't."

I tried it out anyway because I heard good things about the formula and the formula is lovely, very reminiscent of the Crushed Lip Colors. My lips can get pretty dry and textured because I have pernicious anemia. It made my lips feel dry but not as much as other lipsticks have and the pigment didn't sink into lines or emphasize dry patches and it feels nice to put on. If they ever come out with more colors and stock them in the store I'll definitely consider trying it again, but from the 3 I was able to see in person and the one I ordered they all lean very warm and rusty or rosy.

I haven't been a lipstick wearer in years, but this product has made its way into my daily rotation already. I will definitely be picking up more shades.  Note: A lot of people say there is a big color difference between online and in-person... yes and no? I think online they seem very flat(?). Much more color and sheen almost irl"

The formula feels like literal silk, absolutely divine. They weren't kidding about the weightless part, it's seriously wild.   The shade Baby is a p e r f e c t match to my natural lip color,  which I honestly wasn't expecting (it appears just a bit more pink on me than in the photos, I was hoping for slightly warmer/less pink) but I am obviously thrilled to have found! My lips can be a bit pale/patchy in color, so this is a huuuge win for me. A very happy accident!  Slip is just freaking gorgeous. My usual go-to nude is Mac's HoneyLove, but the formula on these lipsticks make them just so easy to apply (especially versus Mac's matte formula which takes a bit of care in application), this one is going into heavy rotation for SURE.   I also just slid over to Merit's website to nab Tiger (currently out of stock here) so I think it's safe to say I'm a fan and if they ever go out of business or stop making these I will personally riot."

I only took off 1 star because I'm still going to buy other shades because I think it's such a beautiful line & I'll probably wear a gloss over it to smooth out my lips, but if you have fine lines in your lips and they bother you this probably isn't the formula for you!"

(including mine, which is light-medium skin) Very comfortable on the lips, lightweight balmy texture with a perfect amount of colour payoff. It does provide some hydration but I find when it's wearing off over time my lips don't feel super hydrated, however they don't feel overly dry. Perfect to pop on with a full glam look or a more natural daily look. I would pair it with a lip liner for extra coverage and longer wear but, I think it looks great without a lip liner and doesn't feather from the lips from what I've experienced wearing it so far. Overall LOOOVE this product and formula and will definitely buy more of the colour range!!"

However, I'm finding that both of these shades make my lips tingle and then eventually peel. I don't experience this with any other lipsticks and can only name the original Bite Beauty formula as having brought about the same reaction. So, yay for the shades and application and the attractive and weighty packaging. Boo for the reaction. If you react to lip products, proceed with caution."

            "review_text": "MERIT advertises this as a sheer lipstick and I am disappointed that I let myself fall into the brand hype. It definitely doesn't apply sheer, I'll start with that. The color payoff is decent, but it's so balmy and shiny that it takes quite a few swipes to actually get the color to fill right. It applies potently at the outer layers of the lips and then just struggles to get any legitimate color on the inner part of the lips. Then at the first sip/bite of anything, ANYTHING, it transfers immediately off the lips and on to the cups/utensils. Literally fades within seconds. So I guess that's what the sheerness refers to. Why did I pay $26 for a sheer lipstick??? It also claims that the ingredients are so hydrating the color will not settle into lines and accentuate them, but it certainly did for me. All in all, not a worthy purchase. I appreciate the low maintenance natural makeup movement, but this is just a way to take people's money. A tinted balm gives similar color payoff, but much better hydration and benefits for the lips, for much less money."

            "review_text": "I'm always on the hunt these days for lip products that are easy to wear and give me that effortless model off duty look and I think this lipstick does that pretty well.   The shade I purchased, Slip is a warmer neutral brown that falls into the types of shades I typically like to wear. The name for this shade is pretty apt,as the formula itself has a very nice slip to it and it is pretty easy to put on even with minimal or no prep to the lips, but it's not so soft that the formula gets mushy or falls apart as I'm trying to use it. The formula is buildable, but I will say that it still imparts a pretty strong amount of color after a few swipes on (which I don't mind at all), so if you're looking for something more akin to a lip tint this isn't going to be that necessarily unless you choose to blot to tone down the color.  I like the way the formula feels on the lips fairly well, but seeing as my lips are perpetually dry I prefer to prep with a balm beforehand, although for this lipstick I keep that step to a minimum because I've noticed that sometimes it doesn't like to play with my balms very well if I've applied too much.   The component is VERY luxe, for the price I figure I'd be getting another, more expensive brand and it is a pleasure to use and display on my vanity.   Overall, I highly suggest this lippy if you're into products like Glossier Generation G, but you want something less matte, and easier to apply and easier to build. It's a win in my book!"

They have really done an excellent job curating all of the shades; each one desirable to a wide consumer base! The formula is so lightweight on the lips, I'd say a very comfortable satin, buidable from sheerish to fuller opacity. It's just the perfect lipstick, in my opinion. I have too many lipsticks to count, so I certainly wasn't looking to buy a new one, but the component and reviews drews me in and boy, it knocked my socks off. The component is weighty and luxurious- a departure for Merit. I even feel a bit glam pulling it out of my purse; not bad for such an affordable price."

You can pick if you want to go more sheer or bolder. I love the texture, which is very comfortable and light. They are easy to wear throughout the day and will be a daily staple for work. As I said, I love them all but the biggest surprise for me was Tiger. I'm not a big red lipstick person, but I liked that it was subdued and as described, more brick coloured. It's perfect. But I think my absolute favourite has to be Cabo which is that perfect orange colour which is so in this fall and winter, but without being too bright. All 4 of them though, are winners!"

It is almost as if you took your fingers and smudge it a little bit. My lips also felt very soft after putting it on, I'm so used to putting balm first before I put on lipstick but I skipped that for this because it was not needed. If you want a brighter and more extroverted color, I wouldn't pick this one for you. Personally, I would wear this particular color out for dinner if I want to feel elegant."

It's the perfect shade such that it will work great in Summer and Winter.  It's also much more moisturizing with better pigment than other reds that I've tried so I feel like I can wear it all day without worrying about my lips looking like a shriveled raisin or fading.  Super light-weight and silky without any tacky or overly matte finish.  Will definitely be trying more colors!"
