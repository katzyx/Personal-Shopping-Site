Went at the location, picked it up, and noticed the bag was light, but when I looked in the bag, I saw a small box, so I didn't pay it no mind. When I got home to open the product, the box was empty. I immediately called the store to explain the situation. They told me they would check it out and give me back a call but I told the person I was coming back to the store but on my way there I got a call and was told they have one for me when I get there. After receiving the item, I should have opened up the package in the store, but I didn't. When I got home, I didn't open it up until I was ready for bed only to find out it was a use item. I'll never do pick up at that location ever again. Bad customer service!!! I give one star because of the poor service."

I have scarring from years of me chewing my lip as well as my lips splitting in the cold. I originally bought the mask hoping it would just provide moisture, deter me from nervous chewing, and maybe give some protection from the cold. What I got was so much more.   Pros:  - the salted caramel smells good enough to eat.  -I never expected this, but my scarring is going away. I had DARK spots and a little over a month of daily use is fading them. My confidence has been boosted because Iu2019m no longer super self conscious about it.   - the mask is the perfect consistency. Itu2019s not overly gummy or sticky  -LOCKS IN moisture. I live in a colder climate with pretty biting wind. I started wearing the mask when I am outdoors for an extended period of time and it has helped so greatly keeping my lips from drying out.   As far as cons: -the applicator is a little weird at first because it feels awkwardly large to smear on the product but itu2019s not so bad. Youu2019ll get used to it.   -I have to layer a chapstick under my mask. My skin is on the drier side so I have to moisturise first and then lock it in with this mask. Again, not a big deal."

It took me about 6 twists until product came out and there isn't much control as to how much comes out. I'd barely twist it and sometimes the perfect amount comes out or it continues because of the pressure inside. If it wasn't an extra 20% off I'd be more skeptical. I would only recommend based on the effectiveness, but because of the pump I can't take it with me on the go, I leave it half capped at home as to not waste product."

I woke up the next morning with my lips BURNING. i thought maybe it was just because the temperature was dropping and maybe my lips were just getting chapped. as more days past, the pain got worse and worse. my lips are burned still even a week later. it hurts to talk, eat, and just move my mouth at all. iu2019ve tried vaseline and another lip repair treatment. my mom never had any reaction to it and used it several times. i have no idea what caused this reaction, as it has never happened before."

I have tried several lip masks by other popular brands, and where they are all nice, none made my lips look like they did 20 years ago! And this does!! I really thought it was a lost cause lol! But this is AH-Mazing! I ran back to buy 2 more. 1 for my purse, 1 for upstairs, and one for downstairs! Its THAT good!!!"

This product is based on the name only. The smell not the greatest. What works for me is shea moisture on my lips and not the shiny consistency of this product. I wanted to support the business of a black woman but this was HORRIBLE and  I will  not buy again. I am stuck yet again with a product that I can not give away. NOTE TO SELF stick with your oldie but goodie . I am now skeptical  about trying new products.

This product is a most definite to have especially where I'm from, being Montreal Canada with the cold whether during the winter time, while also having the heat on in your household, it can be difficult to find the right product perfectly suitable for hydrating your lips. I had been introduced to this product, as I do follow @fentybeauty via instagram, what initially caught my attention was the beautiful golden colour of the lip mask and the lovely shimmer. What I love most about it is the full coverage that it gives to my lips without it feeling sticky or heavy, I also love the scent and the fact that there isn't much of a taste to it. When it comes to the Plush Puddin' Intensive Recovery Lip Mask With Pomegranate Sterols + Vitamin E, Color (Kalahri Melon) all you need is about a twist and a half or two depending on how much coverage and glossy you want those lips to be ;). I also love the fact that it is long lasting and that you don't need to reapply for about 2hours or so depending on what it is you're doing with your lips to say the least, that is. I will definitely be restoring on this product once it is finished and as I have already recommended via Instagram for my followers to purchase and feel the magic for themselves, I also let those who compliment me in person in on the secret that isn't so much of a secret, ahah ! Thank you BadGal Riri (Rihanna) for this amazing product. With love, Kidane Spence"

It lasts for hours, which is really important to somebody like me who is constantly reapplying to soothe perched lips. The only other product I can compare to is the summer Fridays lip balm however, I would say this is superior. I highly recommend. Pro tip. You may need to twist the mechanism multiple times before you see any product upon opening I recently purchased one that I thought was empty and when I returned it to the store only then did I realize it just needed to be turned upwards of 30+ times which is an unfortunate flaw with the functionality of the container however, I do really like the twist dispenser. It feels more hygienic."

It doesnu2019t slide around much either due to how thick and cushy it is. My only major complaint is the packaging. One of the highest rated reviews is about the packaging breaking, but thatu2019s never happened to me. I just find it inconvenient to use. This doesnu2019t come with an applicator and due to the nature of it, your fingers and the bottle both can get very messy. Thereu2019s also a problem with how it dispenses. You twist it up a few times and it doesnu2019t move, but then all of a sudden it shoots out all at once and can sometimes be too much. If they change the packaging to a standard twist-top jar with a little applicator, this would easily get five stars from me."

If they smell or taste nice, they usually don't work and also don't last. I chose the Kahlahari Melon and was a little concerned it might be overpowering, but it's very pleasant and very subtle tasting and smelling. My lips are less dry and irritated after one session and don't look as chapped. HIGHLY recommend."

The product itself is very thick. It almost reminds me of aquaphoreu2019s thickness without the oil/runny consistency. A little goes a long way! I would recommend to start thin and built it up. Once its on the lips it dries so it is not sticky, it feels more tacky. This product stayed on all night for me (10+ hours.) I hope someday she makes this into a tube packaging someday!"

So, I'm that person who has just about everything you can imagine for beauty and skin care.  This is particularly true for lip products.  I'm not exaggerating even a little when I say that I had a flat, dry spot on my bottom lip for years (literally 5+ years).  If I ever made the mistake of peeling off the outer layer of skin there, I often ended up with a cold sore.  It was the worst!!  I have tried everything imaginable.  The old Bite balm in a tube felt good, but I had to keep reapplying, and it didn't get rid of my dry spot.  The Laneige lip sleeping masks (I've got like every flavor).  They feel good, but still didn't touch that spot.  When I found this, I figured it would at least keep my lips moist.  I put it on at night for about 3 days before my husband said (for the first time in 16 years) that my lips were so soft.  Then, before I even realized it was happening, I touched my lip one day and the dry spot was GONE!  That's been a few months ago now, and it's still not come back.  Yes, the mechanism is weird, but I'll use it the rest of my life to keep this balm on my lips!!  I've just ordered the lip oil too bc I want to try an oil and I know Fenty knows how to take care of my lips!  If you're on the fence, it's sooooo worth it!!"

I won't repurchase unless they change the packaging because I find myself wiping excess product off all the time and it's a waste."

I loved the packaging at first as you turn the bottom to get the product out so youu2019re not stuck digging your finger into a container. However my only downside to the packaging is that the quantity you get by turning the bottom is very unpredictable. It clicks when you turn it but itu2019s inconsistent so sometimes youu2019ll get nothing and other times itu2019ll be way too much. Love the product, but the packaging could be improved."

Within in the first 2-3 of owning it the screw bottom came off and there was no way to attach it back on. So it doesnu2019t sit flat. Now the product fell off my counter and the bottom fractured off as seen in the picture. I can still use it but I have to wind it myself, which is fine but when youu2019re paying money for what I consider a u201cluxuryu201dproduct, compared to chapstick/Vaseline/ I want that packaging to be sturdy. It didnu2019t fall from a high shelf or at a large force. Just normal every day ware. Thatu2019s a bummer"

The complaints I have with this revolve solely around the packaging. I am aware that this is a lip mask, and having components that require you to dip your finger in them are very common, but it really irritated me having to find somewhere to wipe my finger after use. After you twist the bottom to make the product come out, it would not stop coming out even after I stopped twisting it, which resulted in the top becoming very messy and sometimes the outside becoming sticky."
