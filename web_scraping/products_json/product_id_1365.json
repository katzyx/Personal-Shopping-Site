I have used this product before and after washing my face and for some reason I prefer without washing my face and using it. It like takes away all the oil and grime off my face to where then my face feels so clean and refreshed. When I have used this product after washing my face I definitely feeling burning and stinging especially where I have acne. I do have sensitive skin to a degree so strangely enough I'll use this as a quick cleanser before I go to sleep or if I'm in a rush in the morning instead of a deep clean. It is a good product nonetheless and sometimes I'm lazy with my skin care. So lazy girlies this is for you lol"

Who wants strong scents on the face? It smells refreshingly citrus. Another lactic competitor is Sunday Riley Good Genes, but that smells harsh lol. One last comment, which is my favorite thing about RENu2019s tonic..It doesnu2019t dry out my face! An acid product that prevents acne AND helps to moisturize??? Unheard ofu2026until NOW! Donu2019t ever stop making this formula, REN! Itu2019s perfection!"

I've struggled with large pores for as long as I can remember, so finding this product has been miraculous. Iu2019ve noticed smaller pores. My skin felt smoother and looked more refined. Safe to say, my makeup application was flawless. The AHA tonic has been a true hero as a dark spot corrector.

The formulation has been amazing!  I have sensitive skin, and the AHA tonic never once caused irritation. Instead, it embraced my skin with a gentle, subtle touch, delivering results without any harsh side effects. Very happy with the product!"

However, within the last year REN redesigned the bottle to remove the pump dispenser for the product. This is upsetting because the pump allowed me to get the right amount of product every time. With the new bottle set up, I get too much product on my cotton pad which leaves me with a lot more wasted product and a sticky residual feeling on the skin. The old pump was perfect and I hope REN reconsiders bringing it back.   Otherwise this formula is wonderful. I have oily skin with more noticeable pores. When I use this product I feel that my skin is lightly exfoliated and tightens. It has never caused my skin to become dry. I recently implemented a retinol into my morning routine within the last month, along with using this product and my skin has not dried out. Considering the issues I have with getting too much product on the cotton pad, that says something. I think that the product is wonderful and recommend it. I don't plan on ever purchasing other toners as a result of how well it works for me even though I dislike the new dispenser. It's the only reason this product is getting four stars instead of five.  Formula is five stars easily Dispenser is a three."

The brand REN has been a favorite of mine for a while now, ever since I needed an effective skincare brand to use when I was pregnant over 11 years ago. It is a very no-frills, yet effective skincare product that fits beautifully into my routine. It's a nice gentle, daily exfoliator thats not abrasive or too strong. On me, it doesn't sting or burn but also keep in mind I don't use it if I have broken skin or any dry irritated patches. I also like to use it on my neck to prep for my skicare products. If you use too much it can be a LITTLE sticky tho, so be mindful of that."

I  FELT IT!!! It gives you a nice little sting on the skin to let you know the product is working.  For dryer skins, I would recommend using it once or twice per week. Oilier skins can tolerate daily use.  It is a clean product and the packaging (bottle) is from recycled plastic and is recyclable as well.  The product is vegan and it is only good for 9 months after you open it for the first time.  It has an extremely mild scent.  I love this product and I will continue using it."

Over all my complexion has visibly evened out and has a new smooth texture (or lack of) to it. This product has so many benefits that would work well on anyone. Another factor that makes this such a wonderful product is the amount you get.

Im sure it may take A few weeks to see an actual brightening of any dark spots so be patient and consistent to see results.

Other estheticians have told me it takes some getting used to if it wasnu2019t already in the routine. I was someone using regular toner but I can say that my skin is requiring more due to aging. Off rip, the toner kind of burned the first couple of times I put it on with one of those times being right after I exfoliated which the bottle said not to do but I didnu2019t read it until afterwards so reading is fundamental. This product is already an exfoliant so using one prior to putting this on will burn. I canu2019t stress that enough. It definitely gives an instant glow which I thought was very unique as most toners Iu2019ve used mattify the skin. It also didnu2019t leave my skin feeling so dry after application. I tried the toner by itself and underneath my makeup and loved both. I can definitely see all the praise worthy claims and the improvements in my skin from using this product.

I tend to have dry skin so I was afraid that the alcohol which back in the day is what toners were notorious for kept me from using them. No stripping and drying out the skin for this girl. That being said toners are formulated now with more skin-friendly ingredients and offer many amazing benefits that do not dry the skin out. Instead they restore skinu2019s pH, minimize pores and hydrate or exfoliate, creating a complexion thatu2019s more radiant and improving your skinu2019s overall texture.   REN Clean Skincare Ready Steady Glow Daily AHA Tonic delivers brighter skin with a gentle toner that wonu2019t irritate even sensitive skin with daily use. I was super excited when I heard that this toner didnu2019t have alcohol in it. REN is formulated with lactic acid and salicin from willow bark extract, which are gentle but still powerful with their exfoliating agents that brighten tired skin, break down buildup and minimize the appearance of pores. My overall thoughts: I loved the  light citrus scent. It is not overpowering and dissipates quickly. After a couple weeks of using this product I have noticed my complexion looks clearer and brighter overall. I also have been using this on my daughters back and have noticed improvement in her to acne scars. I also believe my hyperpigmentation is a little lighter and overall my skin seemed to look plumper and more hydrated.

This toner does do as advertised though, it leaves your skin feeling tight and looking less dull. It has not only an AHA, but also a BHA to fight dead skin cells even more. As someone with skin that runs on the dry side that is not always my favorite sensation, so I moisturize as soon as the product is absorbed to help ease that sensation. I also only use acid based skincare like this a couple of times a week. I do have to say that one of my favorite features of this product was the packaging. Particularly how easy it was to apply this toner to a reusable cotton round. No pumping mechanism means easier recycling once you are done with this toner, but it is also less messy application in my experience. I also have to give the brand kudos for their care of the environment, being a zero waste company."

My last toner was the L'Oreal Revitalift Derm Intensives 5% Glycolic Acid Peeling Toner and that was $15, so to jump up to Ren you know that sample was a punch to my skin. The L'Oreal toner was good but Ren really does everything. One of my biggest complaints are those little bumps on my forehead and I do not have an immediate clear up, but between this and the Biosssance Lactic Acid at night a few times a week, it's really clearing up."

Started with 3x a week and now I use it daily. My skin is looking incredible. All of my old acne scars are gone. Pores? What pores? Fine lines are barely visible. Clears acne fast and treats those little bumps under the skin before it turns into acne. Wears well under makeup (with high spf of course). Beat part? A little goes a looong way.

The only issue is that a regular cotton round is not good for this type of product because it will absorb and waste this liquid gold. Also, I preferred the pump, not sure why they got rid of it? I will also admit that at first it would make my face sting at first contact, but it was my first time using a chemical exfoliant so my skin was not used to some of the ingredients. Now my skin cannot live with out it. Give it a shot!"

For several weeks I have been trying to get rid of my maskne scars all over my cheek and chin areas, I never struggled with acne before so it's really been bringing me down. I tried several expensive and inexpensive brands of face masks, peels and niacinamide and tranexamic acid treatments, with minimal changes to these scars. I recently bought this on sale because I remembered how clear it left my skin once when a makeup artist used this on me back when Sephora did makeup appointments. Last night I put it on, I have sensitive skin and it did sting for the first 10 minutes and then looked a bit sticky, but I followed the instructions of using a cream and then I  added a few drops of Inkey list niacinamide drops on the scars. I woke up today and my scars (which again I've been struggling with and haven't seen major improvement on) were visibly faded! Within ONE treatment! I'm so glad I have this product now, the amount of money I spend at Sephora I promise you this is one of the best items I have invested in. I hope this review helps anyone who has been going through this struggle, I know how defeating it can feel at times, and if you are on the fence about this one just try the mini and see if it works for you too."

During the peel process...my face definitely peeled (it looked really horrid!). It peeled everywhere...aside from my damn cheek! I swear. The only part of my face that didnu2019t even flake was my problem area!! Talk about disappointment!! Enter my cousin who suggested I try this toner! Listen, after a week of using this toner that damn sun mark is almost gone! To say that I'm ecstatic would be an understatement.

When I woke up in the middle of the night last night to use the bathroom, I happened to look in the mirror when washing my hands, and was really struck by what felt like a pretty major difference in my skin. I purchased the smallest size, just to not invest in the big products only to discard them. When that runs out, I'm definitely getting the larger one. The only other thing I changed in my skincare routine was to add an occasional (like 1-2X a week) application of the Kiehl's pore-reducing mask. Otherwise I still wash with Cetaphil and still moisturize with my La Roche-Posay hydrating cream. Since this is the only big change, I have to assume it gets the credit for the change! It's worth the money, and if you get a few pimples at first, power through!"

The redness doesn't last very long, but I really wasn't expecting to get this reaction, especially because I'm not overdoing anything, I do not apply harsh products on the nights I use it.  The good things about it: the scent is very mild and natural. I know other people don't like it, but to me it smells a bit like an orange peel. It doesn't feel oily or sticky on my dry skin, and it doesn't sting or burn. I have noticed a small brightening effect, but I use vitamin C in the morning so I can't say which product made a difference.  I will post an update if I see any changes. I got this for free, but so far I wouldn't purchase a bottle. But if you want to try some kind of AHA and don't have an issue with essential oils, you could get a mini."

Enter Ren - my skin seems to love every single product of theirs and this is no exception! Got a free 100ml sample of this toner through a Sephora promo and my skin is in love. It still tingles a bit on application but causes no redness or irritation and Iu2019m able to use it every second night. The next morning I definitely notice a difference at how soft and silky my skin feels. Once Iu2019m done the sample (100 ml seems to be going a long way!) Iu2019m definitely going to purchase the full size bottle. As with anything, different skin types will have different reactions, but if you are looking for a gentle yet effective toner I would definitely recommend trying this out!"

Also, after applying this to my face with my hands, I notice a soapy consistency on my hands with some foamy bubbles which feels a bit sticky. This product also seem to leave an unflattering shine (rather than glow) on my face especially when layered with other skincare products which doesnu2019t happen with my other toners. Overall, the product is okay. If you are mainly looking for the ingredients for chemical exfoliation and you only put moisturizer after this step, then this should work."

Made my skin break out a bit probably cuz it was cleaning bacteria under my skin i didn't know about. I wud recommend but please follow the directions. Stay out of the sun. It makes your skin more susceptible to burning. Not fond of the scent at all. Does a good job of cleaning tho. Posted a pic with no makeup so you can see the slight redness on nose. Very clean skin tho. I always used this on clean skin and it still made my pad dirty so yea it works great!"

I prefer to use this every 2-3 days, and I still see results! My hyperpigmentation has been reduced, my texture looks smoother, and it's doing everything an AHA toner should. I just don't recommend using it daily like the bottle says.

It has lactic acid (Aha) from yeast fermentation that exfoliates and helps to remove dead skin so my face is so much smoother. My face appears brighter and refreshed in the mornings when I wake up. It has a nice citrus smell that is not overpowering.  Now when I apply my foundation in the mornings it goes on a lot smoother and doesnu2019t sink into dry skin.  I love that itu2019s Vegan and safe to use on my face so no harsh chemicals!  Iu2019m happy I was able to try this as itu2019s my new favorite toner!!

REN does none of the above. The scent to the product is light and there was nothing harsh when Appling it to my face. It left my face feeling refreshed and added a little glow to my skin.  This is definitely a product I will purchase in the future."

I would recommend its use on everyone except those with sensitive skin types (if you have sensitive skin and want to try it, do a patch test first). Dry and mature skins can use this but possibly only 2-3 times a week at the most. If you have normal skin, use this 3-4 times a week. Combination and oily skins could use this tonic more times, up to every day. I would say people with acneic skin can use this daily too. Make sure not to use it on open lesions. I used it on my dry skin and the next two days my skin was literally coming off my face in in little balls when I rubbed on it. It exfoliates very well. Brightening effects take longer, as the ingredients in it have to literally stop melanin production in the melanocytes. As the skin exfoliates though and moves up through the layers of the epidermis through the 30 day cycle, skin will brighten and you will notice a difference. Almost all of the ingredients listed in this formula have brightening properties. Some have dual exfoliating/brightening properties. This product also helps to clear clogged pores, so you might notice a little purging too. I had a little bit of purging on my chin after I started to use it. I love this tonic and feel it is useful for those who want to achieve gentle exfoliation of the skin and some mild to moderate brightening effects. When I mean gentle, I mean a gentle yet powerful exfoliation that is not physical (like a scrub). I prefer chemical exfoliants over scrubs because they loosen the cells that are held together rather than literally tearing them off of the skin. Plus this tonic smells divine!"

            "review_text": "The first thing that stands out to me with this product is the clean/vegan ingredients & 100% recyclable plastic bottle.  I am all for clean beauty and a clean planet.  The REN tonic is easy to use; I squirt a little onto a cotton pad and swipe all over my face (avoiding my eye area as directed).  A plus, is you need very little of the product for a single use, so this bottle will really lost a long time.  Another plus is that after application, I can literally feel my skin getting tighter.  If you have any broken skin on your face, you may feel a little burn, but that subsides quickly.  You will literally glow because the tonic leaves a film on your face that makes you look shiny/glowing.  The downside to this product is it does feel sticky.  My fingers are a little sticky after application and so is my face, but what I have found is that applying your moisturizer afterwards helps make the sticky feel subside.  This product states to use nightly and I would never use it before leaving the house or under makeup.  I honestly do not like the shiny look, I prefer my skin to look matte, so I wouldn't want to be in public with a shiny face (I don't mind it while at home).  Plus, I am not so sure this would be too great underneath makeup (haven't tried it).  I apply the tonic every night, after cleansing and always follow up with my eye cream and facial moisturizer.  After a couple weeks of use, I have noticed some positive changes in my skin overall during the day.  I do not mind being barefaced in public anymore and I feel like my skin is a little more youthful overall; clear, even and lighter dark spots/melasma.  See my no makeup selfie attached photo (I am 40 years old).  Overall I recommend this product if you do not mind a little stickiness (that subsides) and a shiny face (some call it a glow).  The tonic has made a positive, noticeable difference for me."

Easy and simple to add to daily routine (I do this twice a day) when I'm doing really good mentally, I usually use a pore refiner serum as well; but my skin doesn't feel like it NEEDS serums or any other skin care product with this. I don't even break out when I'm on my period anymore which used to be painful and unavoidable, my life and confidence has changed drastically for the better. I no longer even wear foundation of any kind at all after wearing full coverage for 10 years. I just use a primer and maybe some concealer under my eyes or on a dark spot I may have - and that's it.

I had to stop acids while on accutane, but after about 4 mo off I phased it in again. I was getting these tiny tiny pimples on my cheeks. This stuff wiped it out.

At one point, my skin did not like this product at all, so I cut it out of my routine, and brought it back slowly.  I think it really depends on how well your skin reacts to AHAs, as well as other products in your routine!

Since I have sensitive skin, it did cause a little redness at the start since it has AHA, BHA, and Azelaic acid, but it quickly goes away after a couple of minutes. And if you wear makeup, even a tinted moisturizer helps minimize the redness until it goes down. After only 2 weeks of use, I noticed dramatic changes in my skin: my random bumps disappeared, my skin tone looked brighter and healthier, and if I even get a blemish or two here and there, it was practically gone after a few days. Also as a bonus, I find it extremely hydrating on my skin after a cleanse with even the most gentle cleansers."

While I am not a fan of anything with a scent, this is kind of citrusy and refreshing.  I have medium light, very resilient skin.  It has a bit of a tingle, and I would suggest being gentle with your application.  I see one review where someone used this twice a day.  Even with pretty tough skin, I wouldn't start that way.  I would suggest using it in the evening and then apply treatment or hydrating sleeping mask after.  If you have sensitive skin, I'd start with every other day and alternate with something hydrating.  I will probably buy this once I am through with the generous sample.  Definitley give it a try if you are looking for an exfoliating toner."

Itu2019s seldom that I leave the house without makeup on, but by the end of the trip, my partner asked if I changed my foundation because my skin was so smooth and glowy!

I have repurchased it twice, with breaks in between to see if I would like something better, but this really is the holy grail!   Side note.

I've been using this about 3-4 times a week because I'm trying to lighten some sun spots I've accumulated over the years, thanks to driving in the California sun. While it'll take many more months to see a huge difference, I'm seeing a decrease in pore size on my nose and noticing a balancing of texture in my overall complexion. I'm good about applying a high SPF everyday, so definitely use sunscreen if you choose to use this in the morning. I've made a small dent in the product after a month's worth of usage, so I imagine I'll be able to test out the true efficacy of this for another 6 months at the very least. Glad and relieved REN is cruelty-free as I've become more of a stickler about purchasing from companies that have a cruelty-free stance on their products. Give this a try if you're seeking overall radiance and balance on your skin and if you want to lighten those pesky sun spots. A little goes a long way, and make sure to slather on a good moisturizer after."

My acne has not reacted to this product, my pores look more refined, and my skin has a nice glow without being too oily. I do agree with some other reviewers that this formula is somewhat sticky compared to other toners. This REN toner is not as water-like as other brands I have used in the past, but I don't have an issue with the formula and it doesn't cause any negative results with my skin or makeup application. I could see people with oily skin however, possibly having more of an issue with the formula. I do not have sensitive skin, so I cannot comment on any other adverse reactions. I purchased the large size product, and I'm not sure if that was a limited edition promotional thing or what but I only paid $45 for 16.9 oz, so price-wise I am very pleased."

Cons: -the smell is mildew like? If you have ever left a washcloth balled up in the shower, it smells like that with a hint of lemon. Its not the WORST smell in the world but its also not the best. -Leaves the skin STICKY at first. I've noticed its worse on my neck for whatever reason.

Given that it's a toner, it does make my skin feel cleaner after and I did see the build-up that wasn't taken away with just using a facial wash, but that's all.

I have only gotten dark spots once, and this product made my face more sensitive to the sun and I have a few faint dark spots. I will say, it can also cause your skin to purge. I normally get small pores on my forehead, I was experiencing blackheads and whiteheads by my nose and mouth and at the beginning this product cleared it but then I began to get them again. I think it just brought out all the dirt and clogged pores from deep within our to the surface, which sucked. I have used it less frequently and at night. It does give great results just use with caution and wear sunscreen!!"

After just under one week of using finally, they are going away?? I NEVER thought these would go away and honestly wasnu2019t even expecting them too. I never would have thought of this brand without the sample I tried and Iu2019m so happy I did. The sample will easily last a month, itu2019s 50ML. I will definitely be repurchasing. I used to use fresh Rose hydrating toner, repurchased that 3 times. I really liked it for hydrating, and did notice a difference in my flaking skin in my t-zone, but this toner seriously makes my skin texture even and glowy and gets rid of that surface layer of dead skin. I will be replacing the Rose with this FOR SURE.   Side note: the watermelon toner was nice, itu2019s soaks in beautifully and does hydrate nicely. But nothing in comparison to the glow this gives.

Iu2019m far from being a rookie when it comes to using acids like AHAs, BHAs, PHAs, etc. - so I was curious about Renu2019s Steady Glow AHA toner. Enjoyed the size and packaging right off the bat. It has a slight tingling effect immediately after use (not a foreign effect for topical acids) but did burn my skin. It left me with tight, irritated, sensitive skin - the affected areas were almost mask-like, in the pattern of the toner application. I assume this reaction is due to the concentration of citric based oils, limonene and fragrance. For acid newbies and seasoned users, use caution when applying this product!"

Within about a week of using it I noticed the acne scars on my cheek were fading away and my skin overall just looked more bright and glowy. I've been getting a lot of compliments on my skin since I started using it. My only complaint would be that the larger size got discontinued. It was twice the product for a much lower ounce to dollar ratio and made buying the toner much more economical. Don't get me wrong, it is definitely worth the price, but we all like a good bargain."

The bumps got worse and I switched back to my regular toner (Neutrogena Acne Stress Control, which I'm not in love with since it dries my skin out despite clearing out my acne) for about a week and the bumps went away.   After my period, I tried out the REN toner again to see if I'd break out, putting it on in the morning. Later that evening, I noticed the small forehead pimples came back. I will likely exchange what's left of the product for another toner that is more gentle on my skin."

I didn't realize that in the beginning and ended up with a very irritated chin!! after much research, and speaking with someone at Ren, I discovered vitamin C and acid toners shouldn't be combined.  The company should do a better job explaining that to us.  It's not a big deal but it's somewhat a bummer as I was hoping this toner could be used every morning.

I have been using this every morning and night for 3 weeks and the bottle is still more than three quarters full. It does not have a fragrance as listed under the Ren Clean Skincare label along with other things it does not have. It offers very gentle exfoliation on my dry/combination aging skin and even completely got rid of some tiny flesh colored bumps I was starting to get under my eyes, which surprisingly did not irritate the surrounding eye area. My skin does feel a little bit sticky after application, but nothing too bothersome. It really gets rid of any remaining dirt and dead skin cells after washing my face. I have also noticed an actual glow with continued use of this product. I have a lot of little dark hyperpigmentation spots from a deep laser resurfacing treatment I had a year ago and am trying out everything to see what works on them. I think this does make my skin more even toned, but Iu2019m also currently using Korres wild rose Vitamin C oil and their moisturizers that claim to lighten dark spots. Either way, I will continue to buy this toner as I find it does not dry out my skin like other toners I have tried before and it makes my skin feel nice and look healthier."

I have never gone back to the same toner twice, so be well rest ASSURED when I say that this toner is absolutely worth it. I have finally been able to cut down my skin care to a simple five steps, and I always use this toner.   Guys, it does what it says it does, but you have to give it time. Consistency is key, and I repeat again consistency is KEY. I, at first, did not think that it was working, but gradually after two months, I have seen my acne scars and hyperpigmentation lighten. I use it every day, sometimes twice a day when I wear make up. Itu2019s sooooo good, that I donu2019t even do a morning and night routine anymore, just a morning one.   If youu2019re not used to using AHAs and BHAs (chemical exfoliation) regularly, this will sting for a few seconds but thatu2019s it.   This toner matched with African black soap is a powerhouse combo and has kept my acne breakouts to once every 4-5 weeks (and by breakout, I mean 2 pimples tops). This is HEAVENLY when not three months ago, my face looked like the Rocky Mountains (we are talking from blackheads to cysts). I had nearly given up on finding anything that worked the way I wanted and this duo came to the rescue. It is so worth it, I canu2019t even begin to explain it for yu2019all."

However, after I changed my application of the product and added an essence into my routine, within 2 weeks my skin was no longer suffering from acne breakouts. I now pump some of the product onto a cotton pad and gently pat it around my oily zones at night only; followed by a hydrating essence and moisturizer. (Before, I would soak the cotton pad completely with product and slide it across my skin covering my entire face.) As a person with sensitive skin, I would recommend building your tolerance up with this product; it will probably still tingle a little since it is an acid. Iu2019m glad I didnu2019t give up right away as it really has helped a lot. If I feel that my skin is on the dry side, Iu2019ll skip use of the toner for a night and do a hydrating sheet mask instead. Hope this helps, good luck on your skin journey!"

For folks that do not deep cleanse on a regular basis or are brand new when using anything with AHA or BHA, use it sparingly. Although there are other toners that do not need or want an exfoliant in their toners, and do a great job at balancing the PH of the skin."

I have a normal to combination skin that is sensitive and acne prone. I get hormonal acne and sometimes milia bumps on my cheeks (depending on the time of the month). I have been using this nightly for 2 weeks after double cleansing and I have seen really great results as far as skin texture and acne. I've noticed a glow that I didn't have before AND my makeup goes on really nicely. There is some tingling upon application, but it's not something that irritated my skin or made me break out. Most chemical exfoliants will have some tingling. Obviously there are other skincare products I use, but this has really worked harmoniously with all of them. This toner has really boosted my routine and I'm glad I tried it. I haven't used it long enough to see results as far as helping with hyperpigmentation, but that takes time.  Long story short, give it try. Whether someone gives a good review or a bad one, you never really know until you try it on your own skin. And who knows? Maybe you'll find something that you really love!"

Always clear skin, no teenager acne. At first I thought this was hormonal but the more reviews I read and the more I used this product, the worse my skin got. I immediately stopped using it.  I have dry skin and the reason why this happened is cause the acid dried out my already dry skin so my skin produced more sebum/oil to compensate and therefore the zits.

I can use the Pixi one straight on after cleansing and not feeling anything but with this one, it still stings even if I apply a light moisurizing lotion before hand (to reduce possible sensitivity). texture: many in the comments have complained that the skin feels sticky after application. It's true but it's more like what the skin feels like after applying a serum or moisturizer. It's tacky but I won't say it's oily. If you expect it to disappear to nothingness when dried (like water), this is not for you.  smell: it's not pleasant but neither is it unpleasant. the smell reminds of burned rubber but it is not strong. there is maybe a hint of citrus but if you like your product to smell like perfume this is not for you. Redness: I did not see any redness but again,  I am taking repercussions by applying a layer of light moisturizer first, and I can tell you it still stinged and the sting, though mild, lasted for a while after application. If your skin is sensitive or are unsure how your skin will react to it, you might consider doing the same (it's still going to work, just less unpleasantly). Overall this product serves its purpose. I applied a layer of heavy moisturizer to finish up my night routine and my skin is cool to the touch (i.e. not inflammed). I use sunscreen heavily and consistently during the day and I highly recommend you do the same because when using aha, bha and retinal in skin care, your skin is more prone to sun damage (e.g. sun burn, dark spots, wrinkles)."

First time I felt like my face is melting I felt like it burnt my face, but I knew it will happen because I was cautioned when I purchased this. I started using once a week and twice a week. Tingling has gone down a lot now it is bearable, but for some reason I canu2019t use it more than twice a week because on the third use I get burning sensation on my skin or even on the 2nd use during the week my face is entire for the good part of the day. I canu2019t really say if it is doing any good to my skin because Iu2019m not using regularly every week and there are weeks Iu2019ve to skip it. Again, thatu2019s just my skin and Iu2019ve super dry and combo skin everyone has a different skin. Iu2019ve taken one star out because of the tingling. In short, good product but not for my skin"

I applied the toner evenly following the directions and I noticed after a few minutes that it seemed to be still wet on my face and it became increasingly sticky. I applied my normal nighttime moisturizer and went to bed. When I woke up the next morning, my face had felt even more sticky and had become oily in the t-zone. I washed and reapplied the toner. Again, it left a sticky, wet film on my face. I waited for a few minutes then applied my normal daytime moisturizer. By Mid-morning, I couldnu2019t take it anymore and had to wash my face. I will say it sure did make my skin glow....bright red. Although it said it was suitable for all skin types, it did not gel well with mine. I have normal skin with some seasonal-related oiliness in the t-zone. Unfortunately, I was not able to keep using the toner to see if my face wouldu2019ve eventually adapted to it and benefitted from the companyu2019s claims of a more even skin tone, glow, and reduced pores."

My complexion has changed from using this and my face looks firmer, tighter, hydrated, smooth etc. I used to have acne scars and this has removed them too.

Not only does this contain Lactic Acid and Willow Bark extract, but it also has Azelaic Acid! Great ingredients to get that Glass Skin glow i'm looking for. I would definitely recommend this product to others. In next month's box, i would love to try the FRESH Rose Face Mask!! August is my BIRTHDAY MONTH so please send me what i want lol, which is the FRESH Rose Face Mask!"

Just start off slow if you've never used acids, use once every 2 or 3 days for a few weeks and work up to daily or twice daily use. My only negative is that the packaging on the big bottle can leak, and on the smaller one it can get sticky all over. Probably a nature of the formula, and I can live with it since its great. Just consider keeping in a vanity tray rather than your counter."
