I am pretty low maintenance when it comes to makeup and usually out of practice, so when I do want to have a wing tipped look it takes me several minutes of frustration to get both eyes to look even.

I do wish the stamped liner was sold separately so you can pick your own to complete the look but I'm super happy with this (not a paid review)."

            "review_text": "Kaja Beauty recently received a complimentary Wink Stamp Wing Eyeliner Pen and Stamp Long. This two piece set promises a dramatic winged liner look in a matte black, waterproof finish. The Wing Eyeliner Pen is slim, with a thin felt tip that comes to an ultra fine point. It provides excellent precision and is particularly useful for my tear duct area, which I like to wing as well. The pen dispenses a good amount of liquid and allows for a smooth application with no skipping. For a wider line, I find it best to outline it and fill it in, keeping it a single, thin layer, as the liner can crack or flake if itu2019s too thick. Itu2019s more of a satin finish than matte; itu2019s not glossy, but thereu2019s a definite sheen. It wears very well, staying put until I take it off. Itu2019s also quite easy to remove for a waterproof formula. It comes off with anything oily, so the cleansing balms and oils I use work well and I donu2019t need a separate remover. The stamp is two-sided, with a wing stamp for the left and right eye. You just line up the wing where you want it and press, then connect it with the liner pen. The act of stamping and lining is really simple. My problem is with lining them up evenly, and neither my hooded lids nor the fact that one of my eyes is larger than the other makes it any easier. I kind of wish the stamps were in the caps, so I could line them up in the mirror at the same time. I tilt the stamps upward for a more dramatic wing. As a typical cat eye, they arenu2019t that big or bold on my already slightly catty eye shape. All in all, I think this liner is cute for a beginner. If I got it again itu2019d be for the liner. The stamp is cool on days when my hand is shaky, but I can otherwise crank out a wing with about the same amount of fiddling, so Iu2019m not sure Iu2019ll reach for it that often. I love the ultra thin liner, though, for its smooth and precise application."

I usually end up looking like a racoon, but after receiving this and giving it a try I can confidently say that I'm not that bad anymore, so long as I can keep using this pen. The lightweight formula glides on super smoothly and the pen tip is soft and flexible. I think that helped me out a lot. I found it a little difficult to correct my mistakes without using makeup remover because it's very waterproof. So if you know what you're doing, that's a good thing. When it comes to the wing stamp, I don't know if I did it wrong but I wasn't impressed. It's kinda, meh. My eyes have a slight downward turn so maybe I needed to work with the stamp more. I am just so happy I can finally draw eyeliner, I'll work on the wing later. Overall a great product especially for us beginners."

I found that I liked the ink from the liquid liner more than the ink from the stamp -- the stamp liner could have been more pigmented. You'll have to go over the stamp with the liquid liner to darken it."

            "review_text": "I recently tried Kaja's Wink Stamp Long Waterproof Wing Eyeliner, and I must say, it's a game-changer for achieving the perfect winged eyeliner look. This innovative product combines a wing stamp and eyeliner pen, making the process incredibly easy and foolproof.  The wing stamp is a genius addition. It creates a precise and symmetrical wing with just one stamp, saving me time and frustration. The shape is flattering and enhances the natural shape of my eyes. Plus, the waterproof formula ensures that my wings stay sharp and smudge-free all day.  The eyeliner pen is equally impressive. It has a fine, flexible tip that allows for precise application. The formula glides on smoothly and is intensely pigmented, giving me a bold, sharp line that lasts. I appreciate that it doesn't skip or drag during application, providing a seamless finish.  I was pleasantly surprised by how long-lasting this eyeliner is. It held up remarkably well even in humid conditions and didn't fade or smudge throughout the day. It's perfect for long days or special occasions when I need my makeup to stay flawless.  One thing to note is that the waterproof formula does require a good makeup remover for thorough removal, which is a small trade-off for the impressive longevity.  In summary, Kaja's Wink Stamp Long Waterproof Wing Eyeliner has earned a permanent place in my makeup collection. It's a game-changer for achieving flawless wings, and the waterproof formula ensures they stay sharp and striking all day. If you've struggled with winged eyeliner in the past, I highly recommend giving this product a try."

You donu2019t need to worry about smudging and itu2019s waterproof too. I am curious on how long the stamp will last before it runs/dries out.  Whilst Iu2019m glad l got the opportunity to try it, I found the wing stamp a tad too long for me.  So l would consider purchasing the original set, with the shorter wing stamp. It would be amazing if they offered in other shades/colours. Now Iu2019m over 40, I prefer using browns, bronzes and navy.   Overall a nice duo set (great value) it would make a nice little stocking filler this Christmas or simply treat yourself!"

Product Description: A double-ended wing stamp and liquid pen liner that is smudge-proof, long-lasting, and waterproof, giving you a super easy winged eyeliner every time. It was tested to have 8 hours of color persistence, smudge-proof, and waterproof effect. Made  in South Korea.   My review: This product comes in 2 versions. The original wink stamp, and this u201cLongu201d one that I received that gives you a more dramatic wing. I never tried the original so I canu2019t speak on comparison. I always have had issues with getting my eyeliner wings to match, and usually go for just a pencil. But I found these products super easy to use, and instructions are very clear. I personally love the length and look of this u201clongu201d version, and would wear it in the day or nighttime. You simply just stamp and then connect with the pen. The stamp is double-sided, and is clearly written which eye each stamp is for. The color is very black and matte. I love how the pen gives you a very nice thin line, and is easy to handle. It does take a few minutes to fully dry, so keep that in mind. I definitely found it to be waterproof, but it does slightly smudge if you rub it with some pressure. With using my makeup remover, I did find that the stamp was easier to remove then the pen. I love that Kaja is a cruelty free brand, and this set is also vegan, gluten-free, contains no soy, no parabens, and is a water based formula. They have many pics and videos on their website to show you exactly how to apply if you have any issues. I definitely recommend this product if you have trouble getting that perfect wing eyeliner. Plus the price is very reasonable!"

Unfortunately, the cushion on the left side of the stamp pen would not pick up ink evenly, so no matter what I tried, it would only stamp half a wing. I'm sure I would've loved this product otherwise. Personally, I prefer a much longer, sleeker shape of my wing, but this shape works for more natural looking daytime looks. The eyeliner that came with it is great, felt tip and doesn't smudge.  By the way, ignore tge person who wrote the product has a stamp on one side and liner on the other, they clearly didn't use the product, as it has a stamp on both sides and comes with an additional regular liner."

Meanwhile, the long stamp was absolutely fabulous. It makes creating Wings so easy because you just stamp it onto your eyes and I love that it had left and right marked on the long stamp itself. Itu2019s a no-brainer. I loved how quick it made putting winged liner on in the mornings!!!!!"

The next day I used the eyeliner and stamped on the wings. Slightly uneven, but that's user error. Well as I wore the eyeliner I could see black flakes coming from my eyes and soon enough, the next time I looked in the mirror the eyeliner was gone. So this doesn't work for my eyes.

The stamp is a game-changer, making it incredibly easy to achieve symmetrical winged eyeliner with little effort.   The formula of the liquid liner is impressive u2013 it's intensely pigmented and dries quickly, preventing smudging throughout the day. Even in humid conditions, this eyeliner stays put.  One minor limitation is that the stamp sizes might not suit all eye shapes perfectly, but with a bit of practice, it's adaptable to most preferences.  Overall, the Kaja Eyeliner is a must-have. It not only saves time but also ensures a consistent, bold look. Receiving it as a free gift was a delightful bonus, and I recommend it to anyone seeking a hassle-free way to achieve that perfect winged eyeliner."

This innovative tool effortlessly allows for the creation of uniform, symmetrical wings on both eyes. It's a true time-saver, especially for hectic mornings or when you want a precise and bold wing.  With a fine-tip pen, you can easily fill in the wing. Its smooth application glides seamlessly across your eyelid. The waterproof formula guarantees that your wings remain intact throughout the day, even in humid conditions or when your eyes are prone to watering. The added bonus of being smudge-proof further enhances its appeal.  However, it's important to note that while the wing stamp is an exceptional tool, mastering its use may require a few attempts, especially if you're new to the world of winged eyeliner. A bit of practice is essential to ensure your wings turn out exactly as you desire."

            "review_text": "I had high hopes with this stamp and wished it magically worked when I tried it but I feel like the learning curve is even worse than drawing a wing with a pen liner (for me, at least). Perhaps my eye shape isn't meant for this long stamp. I have almond eyes and the lids end up covering half of the wings. It was really hard for me to get even stamps on both eyes if they even stamped the wing correctly. I ended up just using the liner in the package to do my usually eyeliner. The formula is a bit runny so you have to be careful to not move at all otherwise the liquid will seep into your eye creases. A perk is that it's waterproof enough to not smudge but still easily removable. Gifted by kajabeauty."

So I think some of the bad reviews is from the first few times a person uses it. It gets better. You have to find a way to do it so it is at the right angle and the stamp is dark enough. I find that turning it upside down for a few seconds before using it make the stamp darker.  When I stretch my eyes and stamp it, it looks horrible once release, so I don't stretch it. It is a great waterproof and stays on. But that can be a problem if not done correctly and I believe the frustration  of removal is a part of the criticism.  Because of this they should give better instructions. I first started by doing trials on my hand to get it correct then started on my eyes and that made a difference. It only took doing it on my eyes a couple of times to perfect it. But now I am a pro.  This is gifted by kajabeauty"

First, it comes with 2 pens, the wing stamp pen and a standard liner pen. I loved that there was a left and right stamp so it wouldn't just be one generic triangle.  The shape is great and it has a nice swoosh. The problem with the shape is in the side that hits your skin; It's perfectly flat while the area around your eye is curved. That means that when you stamp, the center hits first and you have to press it down more for the ends to hit. That gives me a big splotch in the center that I have to fix.  When I tried out the eyeliner pen to finish the look, it wasn't as wet as the stamp and when I tried going over areas more than once, it removed the pigment underneath. It was just a mess.  On top of that, it's supposed to be waterproof and smudgeproof but it's not. The area that I practiced on my hand wiped clean with just water, even after sitting for a while and drying down.   When I did manage to complete a look with it, it started flaking after a few hours. This formula is NOT IT. I would have managed to make it work if the formula was good, but it was terrible."

I've always struggled with getting my winged eyeliner to look even, but this stamp makes it so easy. You just stamp it on the outer corner of your eye and voila! Perfect winged liner every time. Plus, it lasts all day without smudging or fading. I love that it you can build on it too. I started out with tiny wing but can add on to it for a more bold look. Iu2019ve tried a non-named brand version and can tell the difference in the quality. This one is 1000x better! I'm definitely going to be using this product for all my future makeup looks. Highly recommend!"

I was excited to try this because if something makes it easier for a perfect wing -- then that's fantastic.  The first time - perfect wing - I put the stamp in the exact right place and it was super easy to get a nice wing - it gives you that start and then you go back and fill in the rest with the pen.   The next time though - I found it more difficult - I put it in the wrong spot.. let's just say I completely screwed it up.   Turns out - you just need to make sure you have it on the correct eye.   There are two sides and they have to be on the right ones or else.  LOL - I mixed them up.    So past that -  It does really last and is long wearing and I think if especially if you struggle to get a precise wing - then this helps!   Gifted by Kaja."

I have hooded eyes and it's never been easy to create wings that don't disappear, so I really like how easy the wing stamp tool made it.

The liquid liner is exactly what I want for a sharp wing: super black, matte, precise, easy to apply, and doesnu2019t run or smudge.   The wing stamp, however, is just ok. It bleeds all over the place! I thought it was a trial and error thing and maybe I pressed to hard or I had to angle it right, but itu2019s watery and runny no matter what pressure I use or where I stamp it (tried on my eyes of course, my hand, arm, etc).   The shape of the stamp part is nice and it does help to get my wings even and the same length, but it doesnu2019t look great when it bleeds. If the stamp formula were the same as the liner formula, Iu2019d probably give this set 5 stars, but the stamp just isnu2019t doing it for me!"

The shape of the stamp is great and thin, I will continue to practice using it probably but I have to say though itu2019s a true black and long lasting. Smudge proof, kids proof.

I truly struggle a lot with doing wing liner that why I hardly wear it because often times one comes out perfect and the other side comes out messed up so after I have taken so much time doing my eyeshadow I want to take it all off so to prevent that I just donu2019t wear eyeliner. Seeing this product gave me hope to try again when I opened it and saw a stamp I was like how can this be its labeled left and right so you are able to get the wing on both sides and it was instantly no mess the perfect wing. I was amazed like is this really happening. It went on perfect like I created it all by myself. Thank you so much for this product for people struggling with liner this is the holy grail!!!"

Itu2019s not incredibly user friendly, it takes a few tryu2019s to get it right. The pigment is great and it dried matte like it says. It wipes off very easy if you wipe it off before it dries. Once it dries itu2019s there all day/night. A little flaky due to its matte finish. Love the concept but the execution wasnu2019t there for me. Packaging is really cute and quality. Iu2019ll continue to use but wouldnu2019t purchase in the future. Gifted by Kaja"

The finish is a natural matte I'd say. It's not shiny. It's very opaque and I didn't have to go over lines. I love how firm the tip on the liner marker is, it helps my clumsy hands which usually make a mess with eyeliner. I think it'd be an excellent tool for beginners or others new to makeup but had fun with it regardless. I do wish it was a little more affordable. I'd pay $25 for it, but $30's a lot."

First you use the stamp to create the wing look then with the pen you draw a line to the other end of your eye and boom you are done! The stamp is already preinked so no messy application. I have tried a stamp in the past and it did not work due to the fact I had to dip it in the eyeliner then stamp it on so it ended up looking messy and made it hard to use. Kajau2019s stamp is all set and ready to be stamped on your eye! Amazing. If you are wondering if it actually last all day well, it does! I wore it from 6:45 am to 8:30pm and it was in tact by the end of the day. I would definitely recommend this eyeliner!"

I have always struggled with trying to get my eyeliner and winged look to get as symmetrical as possible.   I would get aggravated more when I would give up and wipe off my makeup because I wouldnu2019t even want to bother finishing the look.  Winged eyeliner is such a classic and timeless wear for everyday to all occasions.  The Kaja stamps are waterproof and juicy like filled with product.   My skin was not irritated at all after wearing it for more than six hours.   What I love more is how fine point the Kaja eyeliner pen is thatu2019s included to this package.   This pen helps flick away much easier and play up your eyeliner looks with lots of fun thin to thick lines.   And itu2019s so easy to fill in any sparse spots where more eyeliner is needed. I love how effortless my eyeliner part of my makeup routine became for me using Kajau2019s eyeliner stamp."
