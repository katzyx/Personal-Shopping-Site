My lashes were falling out with my old mascara but seem MUCH healthier since switching to this one. It lengthens and thickens and stays on all day without flakes. Is easy to remove with a primer. My one complaint is that it is clumpy, however, I bought a lash brush with metal tines and itu2019s completely solved the problem with clumps! I brush through with the brush after applying a few coats of mascara, while mascara is still wet. Highly recommend if youu2019re looking for something that is gentle on lashes / promotes lash health AND gives good volume and length!"

I get compliments on my lashes weekly.  This product doesnu2019t flake but I because I rub my eyes when they are tired, I do occasionally get a little smudging but I blame that on me and not the mascara. Oh, I work a job where I occasionally get called out to work at night and on the weekends and I have even been able to pull off wearing this for two days straight.

I tried this mascara by itself and then I tried with the primer. With the primer, my lashes looked like fake lashes. If you like fake lashes then these products are perfect for you because it is easier than putting fake lashes on. The mascara dries really quick on the primer, so itu2019s better to do an eye one at a time so that you have time to clean or fix something before it dries."

I rub my eyes habitually, and it seems to be able to handle my abuse without running, so thatu2019s a huge bonus.

The formula isnu2019t heavy when on (it can get that way if you build up layers though) color is gorgeous and it covers the primer really well. Packaging feels a little odd and cheap, not my favorite. Would give this product over all a 3.5 - Good formula, weird packaging, needs better applicator.

Unlike most mascaras, this does not cause your lashes to look clumpy and does not have that grainy fall off when you take it off. This made my lashes feel and look amazing. The wand brush is small and gets all the hairs. It allows you to apply as even amount of product without using too much. This mascara will make you forget about using falsies, Iu2019m really impressed with it! The packaging itself is cute and sleek so it will fit in your small bags on the go."

I think the price is very good and I am definitely doing to be buying it after mine runs out. It goes onto your lashes so smoothly and nicely. It says on all day and does not fade in color at all. I only have to use a little so this will last me a very long time. I am very happy with the results of this mascara and I have been using this everyday and I have never had any real problems. It doesn't get all over my eyelids like some other brands do. It has a very nice paraben free ingredients that won't hurt the healthiness of your eyelids. My overall experience with this is very amazing and I am very pleased. Before trying this I have never heard of the brand Grande before but after this it is definitely up there as one of my new favorite brands."

It also gives my lashes a lot more length, especially with the white grande primer. It's thick, but smooth. When you pull the wand out, you'll see a flow of product falling from it instead of just a thick chunk. Not sure if that matters, it's just an observation of mine lol It's nice though."

If you don't mind going through your lashes with a clean spoolie or another, thinner mascara for your second or third coat as this one begins to dry, I definitely recommend it. The overall results are nice, and I'm going to re-purchase it."

I'm so glad I did as this mascara is the best I've used.  It gives me some volume and also length and I can build it up to give me some drama.  It's not as dramatic as perversion but for everyday, it gives enough drama.  The best part is that It doesn't Flake or smudge at all and somehow it helps give my straight lashes some curl without using an eyelash curler.  I do use this with the grande primer and they work great together.    For reference, I have oily lids and sensitive eyes and this mascara doesn't irritate my eyes.  Love it!!"

For a while now I have been bouncing between Dior, YSL and Too Faced BTS ... not sure what made me open this sample and give it a try when I have open tubes of all of my favorites and a ton of samples I have been looking forward to trying for a while because of an interesting brush or a promise the formula makes, but I did ... and may have found my new favorite.  I have been using it for about 2 weeks now - the formula is great and clump free.  It is the perfect consistency between wet and dry - wet enough to evenly coat, thick enough to show up and give great volume.  The brush looks like nothing special (then again, when comparing to Diorshow or BTS, I guess most brushes look run of the mill ...) but it evenly coats and separates lashes.  I don't find it flakey and it lasts all day until I take it off.  It is a really deep black - looks great with liquid liner or no liner at all - really makes my eyes pop.  Not sure if this is thanks to the mascara or not, but before I started using it, I noticed some of the eyelashes on one eye seemed broken off and much shorter - not noticing those broken lashes anymore and my lashes seem softer and better conditioned.  Credit may be entirely or even mostly due to changing to an oil makeup remover/cleanser, but at the absolute least it is not drying my lashes out or making them brittle - my lashes look and feel great even after I remove the mascara.  I had never heard of Grande Cosmetics and in one month, 2 subscription boxes had Grande samples ... and I really liked them both!  I have a feeling that when this tube runs out, I may give away my sample stash and just buy a new tube of Grande Mascara!"
