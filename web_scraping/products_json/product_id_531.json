It smells almost 100% identical to jimmy choo by jimmy choo, which I've got the full size, and it just sits there lol. It also smells a hint similar to Flowerbomb minus the patchouli and add pear.

My goodness, one thing Ms. Aina knows how to do very well (aside from slaying and snatching our edges every week) is curate an experience within a fragrance!!! The sweetness of I Am Her isn't overbearing - it's actually very intoxicating thanks to the oud note within the formula. I personally don't get much of the red velvet, but the raspberry (and pear) note also makes this scent smell so juicy and nice! This is definitely a scent for the women who love to take up space and do so without hesitation! And if you have a man?? Chile just start working on your baby registry and shower the moment you wear this around them. 10s across the board!!!!!!!!! ud83dudc85ud83cudffe"

I only use 1 spray myself, since it starts big, I feel like more sprays the whole room will smell you and it might start to give body spray vibes. Lasts a few hours well, but you might want to add again before date night if you had it on all day for work.

It is a very soft, feminine scent and I definitely smell the fruit notes mainly the pear. I will say that this l, on my skin, only lasts a few hours, maybe four tops and that is even consistent on my clothing because I do tend to spray on my skin and then spray some on my shirt. So while I do think this is a pretty scent on not sure if I would purchase a full size. I do think they may be a great layering scent though with other fruity scents."

The sweet red velvet note makes for a delicious opening, but unfortunately it fades way too quickly. Within seconds, and as the perfume continues to dry down, you are left with a strong raspberry note and maybe a small hint of pear. Although this ends with a nice fruity scent, there just arenu2019t enough layers left to this perfume. Had the yummy red velvet note stayed longer, I may have felt different. The bottle is gorgeous, but the font and lettering on the front cheapen the look. Overall, the scent and the bottle are reminiscent of something you could pick up at a teenage clothing store.

I received travel size perfume and I really like that it's in spray form not a roller ball. Perfume packaging is simple but nice. As for the fragrance this perfume is a beautiful scent for the coming summer. It's a warm fruity floral scent with prominent notes of Raspberry. It's not too strong and is perfect for summer for an elegant female who wants to be noticed by everyone. It does not last very long for me it was there for 5 to 6 hours. On the whole I like it and wish I could have a full size."
