The bar lathers easily, but I make sure to thoroughly wet my hair before shampooing. I rub it in my hand for a second or two and then directly apply it to my hair. Keep in mind that you may need more water when using shampoo bars compared to liquid shampoos to achieve the same lather effect. The conditioner takes a bit longer to penetrate, but it works wonders if you let it sit for 3-5 minutes. These bars are more convenient for the gym than travel bottles. I allow them to dry slightly before placing them back in the bamboo steamer baskets. I don't keep them in the showeru2014more of a carrying case. Let your bar dry while you get ready, and then store it in the case. If you prefer a shower holder or a wet case, don't use the one that comes with the bar."

This shampoo and conditioner keeps my hair from breaking(about 16-20 hairs per wash fall off), my hair has a softer texture, it doesn't dry out my hair, I love the lather. I have very thick 2b/3a hair. At one point before this shampoo my hair felt thinner, now my hair is thicker than ever. My routine is to wash my hair weekly and I use a scalp massager everytime, condition your hair, and let sit minimum 5 minutes before rinsing well;sure does make a difference. Brush your hair daily and sleep with a microfiber bonnet,you'll be doing your hair a favor ."

Used it a few times before making my review which is this: The shampoo bar builds a very good lather but it's hard to tell if you've used the conditioner bar ENOUGH for it to help your hair. In the shower, my hair felt clean, and immediately after my hair felt very light, HOWEVER the next day my hair looked sooooo greasy and felt stiff and it tangled severely. I had multiple sections of hair clumping together in a bad way, hence the tangles. So I think this MIGHT be a better fit for people who do NOT use a lot of product to style their hair. It's not advertised as u201cclarifyingu201d or anything, so I wouldn't say it's a bad product, just not what I need.   The scent is weird as well. I think the bamboo holder infused a wooden plank smell into the bars, so I felt like I had sawdust on me. Gonna try to return!"

The conditioner bar was a little hard to use, it did slip out of my hands a couple times lol But it made my ends so soft, which surprised me. I would possibly buy just the conditioner in the future but the shampoo was a NO for me. The set came with only one lid so you can stack the bamboo containers on top of each other but I don't understand how the bar on the very bottom would stay dry as the water from the bar on top would drain onto it? It should come with two lids so you can keep them separated."

I bought the Terrace Garden scent because I have curly hair that tends toward dryness and this one is unbelievably moisturizing without being greasy. I wanted something easy for travel, but honestly I think once I'm done with my existing liquid shampoo and conditioner I am going to make the switch to using these all the time, they are that good. Pros: beautiful fresh floral scent, good for the environment, and honestly my scalp and hair just love these. I've had no problem getting enough lather with the shampoo nor have I had any issues with the conditioner. You just have to park your expactations for what a shampoo and conditioner ought to feel like, because it is a bit different, but in this case different is so much better! Some people have spoken about more hair loss or irritation, but I haven't encountered any of these issues. In fact I would say my scalp feels less dry and itchy than usual, which is a good thing. The only con, which I'm totally willing to live with, it that they are a bit messy to keep in the shower. I don't use the bamboo holder, instead I just use plastic soap holders, but like with regular bar soap it just gets a bit messy and gooey and then I periodically have to clean the containers. But again, I consider this to be minor because I'm not hosting any fancy galas in my shower. All in all, really glad I tried these and I'll be using them more than I thought I would be."

It works, but I found that it builds up into my hair and has made my dandruff more prominent. I have to wash my hair a day sooner than usual. I can go usually up to 3 days without washing but this usually shortens it to 2 unless I use dry shampoo. I have fine hair. My boyfriend does not care much for it but it works and he'll use it still. It caused him buildup and bad dandruff, he has 3A curly hair. Smell is pleasant at least.   Conditioner: 2/5 Not a fan. I tried avoiding my roots and focused on the length with it. I like the sheen it gives my hair but it makes my hair flat if I put I anywhere near my scalp, so either way I have to use a different conditioner for my scalp. Makes it not an effective conditioner for me. My boyfriend also hated it, he refused to use it past a week.   Bamboo holders: 0/5 There are better bar soap holders. Mine began developing mold because the design of it does not allow for it to dry all the way in between showers. The size is way chunkier compared to other bar shampoo/conditioner holders and inconvenient, I feel like a tin would be more appropriate and longer lasting. Definitely not travel friendly, I'd rather use a plastic baggie.   Summary: I would recommend just getting the shampoo, maybe conditioner if you really feel it. I wanted to enjoy this product but I am sad that I do not want to use it again."

It takes quite a while for the bars to lather and your hair should be super drenched before attempting to use the shampoo directly on it and the scalp. Instead, I lather the bars in my hands and incorporate it into the hair. Honestly it is mid and I've noticed more hair fallout when I use it. The conditioner does need more work as I feel like it doesn't do much to smooth, shine, and soften."

I've been using the Whole line and others i know and we all knew right away WHY that bar in a review on here was dark on end.  has nothing to do w/Color treated hair. my hair is Color treated.  i immediately take my bamboo holder w/bar out of shower area when I'm done and place it on counter and leave the lid off just a tad and i tilt it so AIR can get through the bottom.  we all know what happens to bamboo when it stays WET continuously,,,IT ROTS!  But if you want the TRUTH,  my hair started thinning after Covid 2x and i started using another product which helps my hair growth and i use the Viori Bars to Keep it healthy.  I'll Never go back to a liquid shampoo except my Hair Growth shampoo 3x per week.  i use the Waterfall shampoo/conditioner/body bar. and i can't brag enough about it. and people notice everyday.  shiney manageable soft healthy and i recommend getting the bamboo COMB! it's the Best for your hair.  and BTW,,,this Sephora Deal is Cheaper than Viori Website.  I'm a regular customer on their website BUT I'ma going to order this sensational deal!!"

I would advise using this only once a week though because protein overload can be detrimental to hair health. Anyone with oily hair may also need to double cleanse. The conditioner is really good for daily use but I have bleached hair so I follow up with something more moisturizing. I love the bamboo holder too. It is really good quality and helps keep the shampoo bar dry, more so than others I've used before. I see it lasting for a while because of its practicality. I would recommend these products."

I love that this set is vegan, gluten-free, cruelty-free, and come in recyclable packaging and it smells great. For me it's important what ingredients are in a product before I put it on my body after reading the ingredients in this set , I was very  comfortable with the clean ingredients they have used. This shampoo and conditioner made my scalp super clean, didn't irritate it like some other products I have used in the past. My hair feels super hydrated, soft, shiny and moisturizer. I would definitely recommend this amazing set to anyone looking for a great clean shampoo and conditioner."

            "review_text": "I recently had the opportunity to try out the Viori Beauty Hair Shampoo & Conditioner Bar with Bamboo Holder Set, complimentary from Viori Beauty in exchange for my honest review, and I must say, I'm thoroughly impressed.  As someone who is conscious about reducing plastic waste and searching for more sustainable hair care options, this set has exceeded my expectations. First things first, let's talk about the packaging. The shampoo and conditioner bars come in a beautifully designed bamboo holder that not only looks aesthetically pleasing in my bathroom but also serves as a practical way to keep the bars dry and clean. The holder is a secure spot for the bars to rest between uses. I found the bars themselves to be exceptional. The scent matters as each scent is curated for a different hair type. I tried Hidden Waterfall, which is for all hair types. Hidden Waterfall is a musky, sweet, vanilla-scent. The natural, refreshing scent is delightful and not overpowering. The shampoo bar lathers up well, and I was pleasantly surprised by how easily it distributed throughout my hair, leaving it feeling thoroughly cleansed. It rinses out easily too. One of the most impressive aspects is that a single shampoo bar provides up to 30-60 washes!  The conditioner bar is equally impressive. It has a rich and creamy texture that melts effortlessly into my hair, providing deep hydration and leaving it feeling incredibly soft and manageable. I appreciate that it doesn't weigh my hair down, as some traditional liquid conditioners tend to do. The combination of the shampoo and conditioner bars has improved the overall health and appearance of my hair. I've noticed increased shine, reduced frizz, and improved manageability. These bars are clearly formulated with quality ingredients that truly nourish and care for the hair. I highly recommend this set to anyone seeking an eco-friendly, luxurious hair care experience. It delivers exceptional results and is a more sustainable routine."

The first couple times my hair didn't feel different than when I use other cheap drugstore products, but then my hair got really frizzy and it started to feel like straw, and I got several gray hairs. I've never dyed my hair and rarely heat style it. It took several weeks after I stopped using the shampoo and conditioner bars for my hair to start feeling normal. The gray hairs could've been a coincidence, but, I haven't gotten more since I stopped using them. I think I used the products for about a month and a half and it's been about 7-8 months since I stopped using it."

Rubbing it directly into my hair was causing strain and I didn't want my hair to break. It made my hair way dryer than usual and very tangled.

These natural solid shampoo and conditioner bars are all natural, and they come with cute sustainable bamboo holder in the kit, no more plastic bottles. I got a Hidden Waterfall set and it smells divine. Shampoo lathers really good and, from my previous experience, lasts around two months. My hair feels softer and shinier, but I use different conditioner, because the one from the set made my hair heavier and I couldn't like it. Description says they come with 2 holders, but everyone I know, including me, received only one. The bamboo holder is also very convenient to store and protect the bars, just keep it on the dry shelf, if you want them to last longer. Would recommend the shampoo to a friend"

They worked great for my thick wavy long hair and let is soft, clean & shiny. I was so happy with the results and I can tell these are gonna last me way longer than my other shampoos/conditioners.

I was drawn to test out these products by the idea of sustainability and uniqueness. I did enjoy the smell of the bars, but you have to work them well in order to lather properly. I have wavy medium length and it was not as convenient as I thought. The shampoo was more workable than the conditioner. After the first use, the shampoo + conditioner combo left my hair dry, heavy and oily. I didn't want to give up, so I used just the shampoo and my hair seemed to get used to it a tad better and used a leave-in conditioner. Honestly, this was not what I expected, so I will stick to my tried and true liquid shampoo from now on. I don't recommend leaving the bars in the bamboo holder in the shower, if you have a drawer that you can put them in after they get dry do so, the holder molds easily."

As for the products the shampoo and the conditioner bar have the smell Hidden Waterfall and they smell fantastic. This smell really does remind me of nature and waterfalls. I also love that these products are handmade and ph balancing too. Like I said the smell you can just smell thr aroma coming from the packaging.  These products are easy to use all you do is wet your hair and rub the bar in your hands and apply to your hair and these bar can last for more then one time use. I love the holder it comes with its the perfect size for the bars and it fits perfect with the waterfall smell. The whole package together just gives me the nature boho vibe which is my favorite.

A shampoo & conditioner bar I had tried months ago were so drying on my hair, so my expectations were low for these.  This hair shampoo & conditioner bars come with a bamboo holder.  The packaging on everything is so nice, the conditioner bar looks luxe with it's design.  I put both the bars in the bamboo holder and just leave the lid off, so they both fit that way.  These take up way less room than your traditional shampoo & conditioner bottles.  I am new to the brand Viori Beauty but I am really enjoying these hair bars from them.  I received the Hidden Waterfall scent and it has notes of sandalwood, amber, and jasmine.   I love the scent, it's not over powering and just gives my hair a good smell.  The bars both performed really well.  The shampoo bar really lathers up good.  The conditioner bar also works well, but I do have to take more time working it into my hair.  It does rinse out easy and my hair feels detangled, silky soft.  One thing I did notice is that slight dandruff has developed.  I never had before.  I am thinking something in this is creating it.  I didn't notice right away though but then this is all I have been using and I just started to notice recently.  I'll have to start using and anti-dandruff shampoo in between using these and see if that helps.  That one be my only con is that it has created dandruff for me.  Other than that, I so like them.  Plus they would be easy to travel with.  For being bars they have been lasting long too."

I have to admit, I was a bit skeptical but to my surprise this shampoo and conditioner bar left my 4c hair feeling soft. It was super easy to apply the shampoo but I struggled a bit trying to get the conditioner spread throughout. I was happy the shampoo did not strip all the oils out of my hair and instead felt like it gently cleansed. I really liked the conditioner bar and how it moisturized my hair. Of course, there could have been more moisture but I did like how it feed my curls. The scent was decent and not too strong after washed out. The best part was the soap holder that will help preserve and store the bars."

The conditioner actually does smell like tea and it's lovely. Overall I really like this shampoo and conditioner, but it has some drawbacks. I have fine thin hair and am prone to scalp oiliness. The shampoo lathers really well and cleans thoroughly. I don't like that it leaves my hair with a squeaky clean feeling, though. The conditioner feels incredibly silky when applying and doesn't weigh my hair down or make it greasy. My hair actually still felt totally clean after 24 hours, which never happens! The downsides are that it feels more dry and less soft than usual, and my natural waves fall flatter."
