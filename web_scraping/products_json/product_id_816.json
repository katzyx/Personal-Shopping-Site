This smelled earthy to me and I knew that I would be washing my hair after the 10-15 minute treatment time but I liked the smell. Before I started using this, my hair color was fading. With use my hair color looks refreshed, cuticles of my hair look smooth with lots of shine. Hoping that with longer use, my hair strands will be stronger and less breakable in new growth and hair already in place. Scalp feels good also and not oily. I would like this in a spray type application as I feel that it would be easier than the oil to reach to entire scalp and strands of hair."

For anyone on the fence, or if you're like me, always in search of that genuine, no-fuss product that delivers consistently, I'd say give the JVN Nourishing Hair Oil Shine Drops a whirl. It's been a delightful addition to my haircare arsenal, and I think you might just fall in love with it too!"

Like, my hair looks shinier but feels more dry than before.  Not sure Ill repurchase, but if you already have hydrated hair and just want shine, this isnt bad!"

The shine drops have a runny & water like consistency, are lightweight, and dont feel greasy on my hands or hair. They add a nice natural looking shine to my hair, help to reduce frizz, and tame flyaways. I love that the scent smells natural, is very subtle, and doesnt clash with other scented hair products."

I drop a few in my palm and run through my hair and the shine is noticeable but no extra added weight!

Typically hair oil tends to make my hair look greasy, but this product really accentuated my curls and added a healthy shine while reducing frizz. The packaging itself is very sleek and the stopper works really well to hold the oil without it leaking everywhere. I only needed to use about 3-4 drops to coat my entire hair. I applied the drops onto my hand and rubbed my palms together before applying the product from tips to root. Overall, the oil has a very pleasant subtle floral scent. I am definitely adding this product to my routine moving forward!"

And it makes my hair smell good. On top it claimed to have UV protection which I appreciate."

I had never heard of this brand when I first began part of the campaign but now I literally am obsessed and want the whole line. These shine drops are so awesome! They not only instantly add a gorgeous shine, they reduces frizz, and provide UV protection. How perfect is that?! I was really struggling with frizz and this combats it so nicely! It has also won quite a few awards and there is no question why. Remember to use this on dry hair or when you blow dry! First of all, it smells heavenly like citrus - grapefruit and tangerine; so your hair smells so good after using it! Its suitable for ALL hair types. I cant recommend this product enough!! I definitely will be repurchasing it when I run out. Its become a staple in my hair routine for sure."

I will continue to use the product after I have hydrated and styledy curls to add shine or after blowdrying on top of my moisturizing oils or perhaps after a few days to just gloss my strands.

I didn't notice any overwhelming scents emitting from this product and that is a huge plus because I do not like scented hair products very much. The main reason I don't believe this is the right product for me is because I naturally have an oily scalp and oily hair, which lead to the shine drops mixing with the oil throughout the day and making my hair look even oilier than usual. I think for someone that sweats less and doesn't have hair that gets so oily so quickly, these shine drops would be great for them.

At first, I was a bit hesitant because usually hair oils are super greasy, hard to determine how much is the right amount, and end up making you look like you havent showered for a few days. For the first time ever, that was not my experience. Take that with a grain of salt, though, because I rarely use hair oils, so my sample size is small, to begin with. However, I think the main player here is the hemisqualane. In general, squalene is a fantastic and great naturally occurring hydrocarbon (oil) that is biologically similar to the oils that humans naturally produce. They took it to the next step, though, and put hemisqualane which is a more stable and fully saturated hydrocarbon which makes it easier to emulsify and makes it act similar to silicone while still being an all-natural ingredient. The shine this product add is the perfect amount; your hair feels hydrated, and the frizz is gone. I use 1-3 drops depending on how much moisture I need, and I'm good to go. I highly recommend this product."

One thing is that it is a tad bit heavier than I thought it was going to be because it claims to be weightless, it is one of the lighter hair oils that I have ever tried absolutely, but I wouldnt say its weightless. so a few drops go very long way! I enjoy this product I think the price point is completely fair especially taking in consideration the amount of product that you get.  This is some thing I see myself possibly purchasing in the future if I can get the weight of the product under control, and for anyone who has not search fine hairs myself I think that this would be perfect but I suggest anyone give it a try and see if it works for you because it is a really lovely product."

On here it says start with less and on wet hair. The box says different. I would probably use half next time or not use it with the blow dry cream. Im unsure if I should be using them together or separate. It didnt give the greasy look but my hair did feel weighted after application. I didnt notice any extra shine but I want to try this again when I straighten my hair and not just blow dry it. 3 stars just for unclear directions and the weighted feeling."

It has a bit of a scent to it so unless you have a sensitive nose, I wouldn't say it's a problem.

The drops dont feel super sticky and oily. They add the gloss without weighing your hair down which is the most amazing part. Another amazing thing is that if you are someone like me who doesnt use too many hot tools then you can just add this to the ends of the hair and let it air dry. It makes the hair look properly done without the feeling of oiliness or heaviness I loved using it and will definitely be a staple to my hair styling product."

If youre familiar with the Oaui and Verb hair oils, I would say its a similar consistency to the Oaui one and that the Verb oil is thicker.

Tried it on hair where the colour and shine from the dye really faded. Shiny as the first day I coloured it.  I love the scent. Very feminine and gentle. I have to return the two other JVM products I bought. The scent is too strong. Thankfully, this one is a keeper. :-)"

It worked best on the ends of my hair.

I also like that it says to put in after your hair is dried because so many serums and gloss drops say to put in before and you end up baking it into your hairu2026 Another thing with serums and gloss drops is if you put in too much or your u201cplacementu201d is off, you can be left with a greasy, unappealing mess. This product seemed lighter than other serums or drops so you could build it up. That being said, I expected a little more of a smoothing effect and when layered with more of the formula, your hair can take on a bit of a u201cstringyu201d and slightly oily appearance. However, in my opinion it seems to dry out or absorb a bit after some time so you dont have to rush wash it out. Its not the most impressive product but the scent is great and its a nice finisher."

Now I don't blow dry my hair a lot so I decided to try it on my wet hair after showering and brushing it through and just letting my hair air dry. It worked great! My hair was Shiny and smooth, but didn't feel or look greasy. Now a little bit goes a long way so if you use too much, like I did one day, the next day your hair may look or even feel greasy. Definitely a mistake I didn't do again. This had a smell almost like a plain conditioner, whichs I'm not mad about."

A little goes a long way if you have fine or short hair, just two drops is more than enough to give it a great look. I personally have long thick hair so i use about 3-5 drops or about half a dropper full. Best method to apply is to rub all over your palms and start at the middle/lower part of your hair. Then, do a quick once over of the top of your head. Keeps your hair from looking greasy at the roots. The drops also have a great scent and gives me a slight hair perfume worthy that lasts on me. Very fresh and clean. Packaging is beautiful as I love the simple and minimalist design. Love that they put this in a glass bottle as it I'd say worthy at that quality and price point."

It's like decorative cosmetics, when on the face it looks beautiful, but when you wash it off, the face is still the same.

It gave me smooth shiny hair both times without weighing it down and gave off a very pleasant, light floral fragrance. I used a very small amount each time because I didn't want to take the chance of overdoing it. I think using any larger than a pea size would be too much for me.

I am white, and have some very fine hair, and some darker, more textured hair (which ends up just looking a boring brown color). So I like to put hair oil on my crown, where my hair gets drier. I liked the idea of adding shine too, but I find it helps the thicker hair but makes thin hair look dull. I'm trying not to throw anything away so I've been using it as like a hair mask before I shower, and it makes it a bit softer."

Love that it is light-weight, & gives a healthy-looking shine, rather than looking greasy like many do. Tames frizz well, & hair looks sleek. Also love the packaging. The glass bottle with dropper dispencer makes all the difference. I only use 2 drops & my hair looks amazing! Won't weigh hair down, nor feel greasy, which is important for my fine hair. I love this hair oil! I am definitely a lifetime fan."

I noticed these drops are clean and cruelty free, which I personally love and is something I look for in products. As with any oil product I worry about it weighing my hair down but these drops really didnt do that, with that being said a little does go a long way so I started with a small amount and rubbed mostly on my ends and in the middle of my hair (which is the most damaged) and then I added just 1-2 more drops for the top of my head and it seemed to be the perfect amount. After using these drops for several washes I really did notice my hair felt softer and looked shinier. My dried ends looked a lot better and were much more manageable! I didnt have as much frizz on the top of my head from fly aways. The smell of the oil drops is just perfect, there is no other way to say it. They have a scent of Tangerine and florals with a hint of sweetu2026its just lovely. The bottle itself is small and is $22 online but again a little goes a long way so I feel like this will last a long time. Overall, these drops are great and have really improved my hair. I highly suggest giving them a try!"

My hair is pretty healthy (no heat usage and weekly hair treatments), with the only salon treatment I have done is a gloss with toner to cancel out the warmth. I didn't think that this product would do much, with even my hairdresser commenting that there's not really anything else I could do to make it look better, but I was proven wrong! Not only does this add more shine to my hair (as it states it would do), but it does not weigh it down or make it look greasy in any way! I have medium-coarse black hair that is mostly straight except for the ends (from air drying), and I've found that it works best for me to apply three drops to my palm, rub my hands together, and then disperse through the mid length to my ends and go through the twice, with one finishing drop for my ends specifically. I have applied too much before (an entire full dropper throughout my whole head, adding even more after that), but my hair did not look greasy, just shinier. I don't think you can really go wrong with this product, and it looks amazing especially after you've used a deep conditioning mask and your hair is smoothed down. It'll last you a pretty long time, as I use about a dropper a day, and after having had this for a month there's barely a dent in this."

This hair oil actually damaged my hair. I've inserted a picture with this review just so you can get an idea of what type of hair I have. The picture of my hair that is attached to this review is NOT what my hair looked like when using this product. In fact, I did NOT have this product in my hair at all in the picture I attached to this review. Unfortunately I was stupid and forgot to take a picture of what my hair looked like while using this product. Just take my word for it, it was HORRIBLE! I have thick, curly, frizzy, long hair. My shortest layer is 16in and my longest layer is 20in. As thick and curly as my hair is, I thankfully don't have a lot of tangle/knot issues. I'm pretty much always able to run my fingers/comb/brush through my hair with ease. Well, I used the JVN Hair Oil and it left a REALLY sticky, thick residue on my hair that made it tangle/knot up REALLY bad. I thought maybe I didn't wash the shampoo/conditioner out of my hair that well and the hair oil was not getting along with it. So a few days later I washed/conditioned my hair and rinsed really well. Put the hair oil in and the same thick/sticky residue made it tangle/knot up REALLY bad. Again, I tried to give the benefit of the doubt and chock it up to user error, and maybe the hair oil wasn't getting along with my leave in moisture product. So a few days later I washed/conditioned, rinsed really well and only used the JVN Hair Oil. Again, the same thick/sticky residue that made my hair tangle/knot. The tangles and knots were SO bad from the hair oil that it actually damaged my hair. The thick/sticky/tacky residue made it so hard to run a comb/brush through my hair to try to get the tangles/knots out that it actually started breaking my hair off, and not from the root. My hair was breaking off mid shaft!!!!!!"

I have no problem using silicone-based products in my hair, but Im always up to trying something newu2014the more the merrier. I do find it adds shine, softness, smoothness and a moisturized feeling. Its not the same sort of softness/shine as silicone-based products giveu2014not better or worse, just different. It gives my hair more of a plump, supple softness than a slick, silky coat sorta feeling that silicone gives. I feel like this is more nourishing for my hair, if anything.   It could be a good second layer on damp or dry hair, after leave-in conditioner and before a silicone serumu2014or just good on its own, after styling for extra gloss, etc. Ive used it on wet/damp and dry hair and it works well on both. It helped my damp hair dry my smoothly and with a nicer wave I think. I have fine-medium lightly wavy hair, and lots of it. Usually my concerns are dryness on the ends, and a bit of frizz.   Ive had this product for over a month, so Ive had a good amount of time to settle my opinion on it. Ill also say that the bottle will last quite a long time; just 3-4 drops per side of my hair seems great (my hair is waist-length)."

What I don't like is that it does not tame frizz. In fact, it made my hair full of static and more frizzy. I honestly think it's because my hair is not yet used to silicone free products, and it is also winter in the northeast, which means lots of dry air from indoor heat sources. I think this may be a good oil to use in the spring & summer months, and I will try it again then and see if my hair reacts differently to it during the warmer months. Still on the hunt for a clean ingredient hair oil that checks all the boxes."

I have fine, medium density, wavy hair and I can apply this multiple days in a row without it weighing my hair down or making it feel greasy. A little bit goes a long way too!! Using this together with the complete air dry cream my hair is SO MUCH HAPPIER than it was before switching to these products, and after a week of using the shine drops daily my hair looks + feels healthier than it has in years. I was not sent this product for free, I purchased this with my own money and I'm just leaving this review so people know how bomb this stuff is! also the smell is SO GOOD too okay I'm done now lol"

I use 2-3 drops and only applied to areas that looked dry or rough, never applied above mid-shaft, then gently brushed out, avoiding the crown. I think this would get pretty greasy if I applied it too close to my scalp because of my fine hair texture. Im super happy with this. I paid full price and wasnt provided anything in exchange for my review. Just really like this product. I ordered the scalp oil too based my great experience with this hair oil."

Well Johnathan and his team did something truly great with formulation that can be used on my thin curly hair or any other hair texture and truly mean lightweight and give that healthy, not greasy glow. I also used it on my daughter who has straight hair and it worked just as great on her. I tried it by rubbing a few drops in my palms to apply after my curls were styled and dry to break the gel cast and the sine and beautiful clean soft scent  shocked me. I was applying during 2-3 day curls since they can get dry at the ends and it would help with a healthy shiny refresh. After air/ blow drying my daughters hair after wash day it tamed her frizz and again the shine was instant and she loved how her hair smelled. I dont think I can not use this hair oil. I truly enjoy it every time."

It's hot here in New Orleans so when I pulled my hair up to put it in a bun, I noticed that my delicate hair wasn't feeling as tugged on and I realized it was the drops. My hair wasn't oily or sticky so I genuinely had to think for a minute why there was such a difference. This one is an easy add when you need a little kick."

I used one drop to start with and didnt notice much, so I added two more drops and my hair just looked oily and stringy u2014 huge bummer! I tried this again after using JVN shampoo and conditioner and letting my hair air dry. I used one drop and then lightly touched the dropper with my fingertips, rubbed them together, and applied to the ends and front pieces of my hair. This gave me a much better result, but still not as shiny as I had hoped. I think it helped my ends a little bit, but not as much as some of the other JVN products Ive used. I also think it brought out the color of my hair a bit more, but again, it didnt add the gloss and dimension that I had hoped for, probably because I can only use a very small amount with my hair type. I really want to try it at night before bed when Im not worried about my hair looking greasy, I think my hair would benefit from this product more if I used it that way. I can see this being amazing for thicker hair and hair with waves and curls, but as expected, I had to be very careful with it and dont really feel like I would instinctively reach for this product given my hair type and the subtle results I got. The scent is nice, it reminds me of baby shampoo, I dont think its the most amazing scent, but it is light and not intrusive, which I like."

Unfortunately I didn't notice any real difference in my hair- maybe a hint more shine, but no significant frizz control and it made it look a little greasy in all honesty.

I put it on damp hair after shampooing and conditioning with JVN Nurture Moisturizing Shampoo and Conditioner. I only used the Shine Drops after towel drying. (No other styling products or leave in conditioner). It made my hair feel smooth and moisturized. I went a little overboard and put on a little too much on my ends but even then I didnt feel like it was greasy or weighed down. Im a first time mom of a newborn and I just had my daughter on December 10th so my hair has been getting neglected to say the least! But Ill be using the Shine Drops to keep my hair from tangling, just a few drops on my ends, combing through and throwing it in a braid will help big time. Im excited to keep using Shine Drops! And when I do actually style my hair eventually, Im looking forward to seeing more shine and body in my hair."

At first, I didn't feel like I really needed this step since I would use the JVN pre-scalp oil as a finishing oil and really liked that application. But after using these for a couple weeks now, I am impressed. They are even lighter than the oil and give so much shine and softness to the hair. The best way I can describe it is that it's like all the best parts of silicone without that sticky, slimy feeling you can sometimes get. When I use this, my hair immediately feels softer and smoother, less frizzy, and looks shiny and healthy without feeling greasy or heavy. A little bit goes a long way, too! I have medium-long hair that is relatively thick and dense, and two small drops will do my whole head.   I have loved every thing I've tried in the JVN range (and at this point, I have pretty much everything!). This product is no exception. It's safe to say these drops are now a staple in my hair routine, whether I'm having an easy air-dry day or styling with heat. They elevate any look and make my hair look and feel so healthy."

It was perfect!  My favorite usage is using 2-3 drops to work through a pony tail. I have tried the snatched pony thing and usually end up with a bun because I dont want to have to heat style the puffy pony sticking off my perfectly snatched scalp. This oil allows me to let my pony free without having to put in effort for smoothing/shining :)"

I included a side-by-side before/after picture just to show how awesome these are! All I did was let my hair air dry after washing it, brushed through it once, and added the drops.

I've actually tried to overapply to see if it ever got greasy or oily looking, and to my surprise it does not! Took off one star because ideally I want it to be a little more moisturizing for winter, but this will be amazing for the warmer months. For now, I'm applying it along with another hair oil to get some extra moisture. I only need 2-3 drops so this bottle will last forever!"

It feels so silky smooth and gives shine to my hair I did not know was possible. The drops are lightweight so great for any kind of hair. I like to use it on wet hair to scrunch out the crunch from my gel cast and also on day 2 or 3 if any frizz pops up from working out or sleeping. The smell is incredible- a sweet floral with hibiscus undertones. Scents can trigger migraines for me and nothing in the JVN hair line has.I especially love that this is a styler and treatment in one so my hair looks good the day I apply but it is also helping in the long run.

Ive tried many hair oils and this one is better than any Ive tried. It has a very light feel thats not heavy or greasy. My hair felt soft and smooth without the feeling weighed down. I have no idea how JVN did it, but this is magic in a bottle. Do not hesitate to try it."

I am usually hesitant with oil based products as I have had the experience where it makes your hair look greasy but not this! It legit does not go on top of the hair and stay there, but rather soaks into the roots. Highly recommend, plus the environmentally friendly packaging is a plus!!"

That said, my hair is also box dyed and deep fried and has seen kinder days.   My first thought on opening the bottle? This smells incredible, and I would bathe myself in it. Second thought? Maybe don't use THAT much.   I took the smallest amount on my fingertips and focused on the ends of my hair. I also put a small amount on the lengths and waited, then waited some more, for what I had concluded would be inevitable greasy looking hair. But you know what? It never came. My hair was shiny, but not dirty. It didn't feel weighed down in any way. Just light, magical, mystical, glossy  princess hair vibes in all directions.  I'm so excited about this product. If you fear hair oil like me but are interested in trying something to add a little shine, this is a fantastic choice."
