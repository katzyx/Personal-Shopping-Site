I've tried many products and what I love about Blume are the gentle ingredients it uses to fight acne. I did experience the purging stage and it did take the full six (6) weeks for me to see clearer skin. You definitely need patience through this stage, as I myself thought about ditching the product a few times, but told myself to give it time. For those who are going through the purging stage, stay patient...it's difficult, but worth it. If your acne is not inflamed, itchy, painful, and pimples are only lasting for 1-2 days, see this product through!"

I know how difficult acne is and how itu2019s so detrimental to our confidence. So when I started using this product and noticed it made a difference? I had to share and hopefully help someone out.   I use this a few ways: a serum/oil as itu2019s own step, a spot treatment underneath/on top of moisturizer, and/or added in with my moisturizer (the barrier+ cream is really rich, so I only add the oil in it at night or if Iu2019m home all day cause Iu2019m a glazed doughnut.)  I sometimes do day and night, I just gauge how my skin is in the morning. If I want to use any pimple patches, I try and make sure I donu2019t have too much product on otherwise they wonu2019t stick.   Will this be for everyone? No. No single skincare product is for everyone. But try it. Give it a shot and see. I did that and in a month I had these results."

It somehow instantly improves the congested irritated feeling of my acne so it doesnu2019t bother me and attract my attention and it relaxes breakouts immediately.   There is no eventual dryness, flare ups or irritation from using it, ever, for me at least. It makes my skin very even, comfortable and glowy.  Iu2019ve found that I can apply to my skin in any state, cleansed or not, and in any amount, as often as I need and itu2019s never too much. By that I mean it never congests my skin or stings from using it a lot. Never ever! Being able to use it anytime and liberally is really helpful with controlling impulse to pick at my skin because I can apply some whenever I need to without waiting until the times of day when I do my cleansing routine.  The packaging is beautiful, functional and convenient. I love keeping it on my nightstand. I love that the oil is green and Iu2019m into the unique smell. I actually have super positive associations with the smell now because itu2019s brought me so much relief.  I held off a long time before reviewing, because lots of acne treatments seem miraculous at first but their shortcomings become apparent later on, even if theyu2019re still worthwhile products. With this I have no complaints and I still love using it. I recommend going ahead and buying this. Itu2019s a great product and different from anything else."

I tried prescription skincare, retinol, azaleaic acid, and all of those seemed to not be making a dent, or even making things worse. Eventually I decided to just quit all the acids and actives and try this product.   So far, it has calmed down quite a lot of the bumpy texture although there is some hyperpigmentation left behind. It responds well to nightly use without irritation. I mix 1 or 2 drops in with my moisturizer and put it over my whole face. Also thinking of trying their hyperpigmentation serum next.  Also, I think it smells perfectly fine despite other reviews! And I'm extremely smell-sensitive. Nice light herbal scent."

If I can feel a spot forming, I'll add some of this immediately, and then continue to use it for the next 1-2 days, by day 3, my spot is usually gone. Would absolutely recommend this product for anyone with hormonal acne."

I didn't mind the smell, although I can see why it wouldn't be everyone's favourite. I think this didn't work for me because I wanted to target my  cystic/hormonal acne. This would probably work on normal pimples, but it didn't work for what I wanted it to do. I didn't notice my acne scars fading either, but it did somewhat even out my skin tone - a bit of a contradiction there. 2 stars because it did help with evening the complexion, but I don't necessarily need this to do that. It didn't work for my intended use - but it might work for you!"

Adding this into my daily routine and combining it with my moisturizer around my chin area has made such a huge difference and is honestly shrinking my cystic pimples very noticeably each day.

Itu2019s annoying to apply the product on your face since you canu2019t control the amount. It says mix with a moisturizer but I prefer to mix it with my other face oils. Not a huge fan of the scent. It smells strongly of the lavender essential oil. Too medicinal and herby for my liking.  But aside from those two fallbacks I would definitely recommend this product. Highly highly recommended it over the Sunday Riley UFO. Itu2019s more affordable and it works better!"

I do like it although I wouldn't call it a game changer by any means. Seems like tea tree is the prominent ingredient, it has a strong smell which I dont mind but other people might not like.

Plus it is a very good introductory size to make sure that your skin accepts the oil. I have combo skin and this oil really help with the areas that are dry. The oil is also very refreshing and not heavy on the skin. It also did not cause any acne or did not cause abnormal breakout. Has a really medicinal feel to it ! I love this oil and make sure to mix with you're moisturizer like the directions indicate ! I did not experience problem with the pump, it works like any regular pump product out there so packaging is perfect from my opinion. I would really suggest using 1 pump only because I just feel like 2 pumps is a little too much product. I really enjoyed this oil and would be repurchasing in the future !"

Iu2019m currently halfway through the (very teeny) bottle, about 1-2 months in, and am disappointed to say it hasnu2019t done anything noticeable for my skin. I wanted to try the product on my chest or butt acne but since the bottle is so tiny I felt I would run out really fast.  Not really sure what else there is to say other than these reviews gave me high expectations but it just didnu2019t work for me. Iu2019m going to keep going until it finishes but donu2019t really have any hopes. I guess one formula just cannot possibly work for all types of skin and acne *shrugs* On to trying the next trendy acne product and hoping Iu2019ll find something.  In terms of packaging, the pump is faulty. Blume did offer to send me a replacement pump but I ended up just transferring the product to an empty The Ordinary dropper bottle (and by the way, the product filled less than 1/3 of that bottle)."

It even managed to annihilate the super little teeny tiny barely noticeable whiteheads on my chin that I thought were a permanent part of my skin! It's a strong tea-tree smell which is unpleasant, but you get used to it.   My only reason for not giving this 5 stars is because the packaging is awful.

My skin was especially bad, from the stress of recent days, but after one night of a couple drops in my regular moisturizer (in place of applying peroxide)... my bumps went down to almost nothing. Every morning I wake expecting to see a surprise, and each morning my skin looks better. It's healing. Redness is fading. My skin is soft and balanced and dark spots are disappearing. Ingrowns happen, but they don't explode, and without the inflammation, they're near enough the surface they can be extracted and grow naturally. It's been two weeks, maybe it will go wrong at some point, I'm just learning this routine, but so far, after having to centre my life around a difficult, sheet and hair bleaching, drying treatment...

Iu2019m not sure itu2019s worth the price either and I wonu2019t be repurchasing as I only intended to use it on my face for hormonal acne."

You honestly need a single drop from the dropper, not exaggerating. Too much and youu2019ll feel like a gross oily mess and it probably wonu2019t help your skin. I put the single drop on my finger and rub it over the problem areas of my face. Some nights, i will use two small drops and put it on my entire face. I also use this under my makeup for everyday wear if I notice iu2019m getting a spot or have a trouble area.   Iu2019m not joking when I say that your spots will clear up in 24 hours. I have noticed a spot in the morning, and by the time I am washing my face after the day, itu2019s completely gone. My original bottle lasted me like 6 months, and i even spilled some.

It gets 1 star for having a scent that relaxes me after I get stressed thinking about how I spent $26 on this."
