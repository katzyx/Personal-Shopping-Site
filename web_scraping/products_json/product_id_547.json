Nowadays more lip balms are coming in a tube form where you squeeze the balm out, however I still like this classic way of twisting the bottom and gliding this on my lips. This keeps my lips moisturized and looking good. I use it daily by incorporating it in my morning and nightly routines. I also like to use it during the days I don't wear lip stick or gloss for a nice natural look. I personally was not a fan of any of the tinted ones and felt it didn't have the same effect as the translucent. I also wouldn't compare this to drug store lip balm like some others mentioned in the reviews. I have tested this recently because I ran out and it took me a few days to reorder then of course waited another few days for it to arrive. During that time I did use drug store lip balm and it certainly is not the same. I had to reapply that over and over and my lips did not look and feel the same. Yes, it is on the pricier side and I'm pretty sure it did not cost $28 when I first started using this. I just hope it doesn't raise in price because this really is a good lip balm!"

This time around, as my balm was running out I ordered another one and it was a completely different experience! While the scent remained the same, the formula must have changed greatly. It now feels heavy on my lips, as if I coated them with a candle wax. More than that after about 10 mins since application it starts feeling dry and needs reapplying. This was nothing close to the original formula experience! It now feels like a cheap $3 chapstick I could buy at my grocery store. I compared the leftover in my old balm to this new balm and confirmed that it felt completely different. Then I came here and read other reviews of people saying the formula has changed. Very disappointed. Will look for another lip balm now."

Sephora was out of Laniege Sleeping Mask which I LOVE because itu2019s the quality of Dioru2019s lip balm but costs 40% less. I decided to buy this as a safe bet because I used to love it and because I really dislike lip balm pots for reapplication on the go. Extremely disappointed!!! It goes on buttery smooth as I remember from previous purchases but is very drying. I found myself reapplying over and over again with no improvements. I also bought Patrick Tau2019s glowing lip balm and thatu2019s way better but I donu2019t like that it comes in a square box without spatula to use, especially given the design. Compared to Patrick Ta, this lip balm is virtually useless in Canadian winters. Iu2019ll be buying Laniegeu2019s original sleep mask again and recommend you try that brand before purchasing any of the Fresh lip balms if you have dry lips and/or live in a harsh winter climate like Toronto."

I always keep a tube stocked at all times. One full sized lip balm lasts me about 6-7 months during warm months, but lasts me about 4-5 months during cold, snowy months. I use this product daily, and frequently use it multiple times a day.   If I have dry lips, theyu2019re moisturized and look supple a few hours after a single use. If my lips are chapped and painful, I coat my lips with a few layers before bed and my lips are significantly improved by the morning time.   The downsides to this product are expensive cost, exclusivity (hard to find in other retailers apart from Sephora), and it can melt in hot cars or in jean pockets. Although it does melt from heat exposure, Iu2019ve salvaged tubes that were left in the trunk of my car all summer. The heat does slightly change the productu2019s consistency if the product was very melted, but the product does continue to work the same and will re-solidify in its tube. If you the tube is kept in the pocket (exposed to mild heat), it gets softer and gives more product than usual when applied.   This product goes a long way. One short swipe on each lip is usually enough to get the job done. I also really love how the product melts into your lips and is absorbed by your lips, leaving your lips soft and supple. This is definitely my all time favorite skin care products of all time and has been for 4 years now. Iu2019ve tried many other expensive lip balms (Eminence, Image, brands carried at Sephora, Loccitaine, etc) and nothing, I repeat nothing, compares to Sugaru2019s Advanced Therapy lip balm"

I agree that it seems to define the lip line, but my lips were plumper and felt better before I applied the lip balm/treatment.  I usually donu2019t even have chapped lips and like matte and glossy products just the same. I think that anyone who is looking for a good lip product should skip on this one. Youu2019re either better with your usual lip balm or, if you want to splurge, the Aerin lip mask is SO worth it. It has a glossy texture and a nude-light pink color, as well but is really hydrating and can be worn off as a cute lip gloss or at night."

I actually took extra care to be gentle with it and not twist it up too high, because I had the same issue with the trial mini a long time ago, but had hoped it was just due to the small size of the mini, because I loved the product itself. Unfortunately, I bought the full size four days ago, and it has already snapped at the very base. I am kind of bothered by it, considering I had debated splurging for the expensive price of $34 for a lip balm for the longest time, and now it has broken after just four days of light use. It still works really well, but now I have to be EXTREMELY (as in even more than I was already being) careful, which is an annoyance I feel should not exist considering the amount of money spent on the product, but has been consistent with two different sizes of this product I have received."

Iu2019ve had to put it in the refrigerator overnight to solidify it temporarily and itu2019s already broken again."

This lip balm even helped me while I wason  accutane and my lips weu2019re horribly dry from the treatment. Doesnu2019tmake me break out either! This is the only chapstick I agree to use. The only reason I took a star off my review is because this lip balm doesnu2019t last very long for the price of it. It lasts me about a month of everyday use and then itu2019s completely empty. So 34$ every month for a lip balm can get pricey if on a budget. Thatu2019s the only downside but itu2019s totally worth it because it actually helps dry lips!"

I just can't give it full 5 stars cause of the price point. There are other more high end lip balms in the market priced at $15-17, and I've purchased those ones before, and they actually didn't work well for me.

The only downside, it is fairly expensive for a lip balm but if you suffer from dry lips, it's worth it!"

The Advanced Therapy formula is thin and melts into the lips but is extremely hydrating and nourishing. Winter here in NYC can be very cold and windy but I haven't dealt with chapping, dryness or flaking since I started using this balm.  It's perfect under masks and I have one stashed in multiple places so I'm never without it.  The pink shade is almost nonexistent and although it can be built up slightly, I don't see much of a difference between it and the clear. This is one of my most recommended products.   **Fresh's Tinted balms have a different, and inconsistent, formula that varies depending on color so I recommend the Advanced Therapy line for healing and the Tinted line for color."

I can feel my Scottish forebears rolling in their parsimonious graves at the very thought of a nearly $30 chapstick :) Still, I'm a big fan of the Fresh line, and I really do love this smooth, rich ... well ... chapstick! I do think that the formula sinks into the skin a bit better than alternatives, and I find the fragrance/taste less jarring even than a good old, straightforward CVS Nivea stick. But, the price tag and the fact that this is still really just a lip balm -- not the end to any major world problem -- does put it into the category of a special treat when you're feeling fancy, rather than a gotta have one in my bag at all times. Also, it has a tendency to melt pretty quickly in 85-90 degree summer temps. So, if you also live without AC, you might want to keep your $30 chapstick in the fridge (as I do) during heat waves."

My previous go-to was biotherm aqua source which is no longer available in Canada.

My opinions were formed after using the product regularly for about 3 weeks.   The container feels substantial, but the product itself does not deliver results that warrant the hefty price. In the past, I have used ChapStick Total Hydration (which sells for around $3), and this $26 luxury item is somehow the weaker option of the two. I do not feel that the product is long-lasting, as I constantly had to reapply it to see any true effect. At some points, I even felt that my lips were in worse condition after the balm had naturally faded over the span of a few hours. There are many skincare products that I find to be worth their markup, but this is certainly not one of them."

It is the absolute best lip balm treatment money can buy. Second to none.   I'll start off my saying, I had extremely dry, cracked lips issues for years. It has always been embarrassing, even keeping them hydrated, drinking plenty of water, lip scrub then moisturize..nothing actually consistently helped. I tried top shelf luxury lip balms *cough cough Emile Cordon....cough* and they were nice to use, but never saw dramatic help with my problem.  I bought this Sugar Treatment finally, since I've heard a lot of good things about it. First swipe on my lips..the smoothness, the absolute buttery, beautiful feel of this stuff. I was wowed, immediately. No lip product has ever done that for me. This stays on your lips for a good while before you feel the need to reapply as well. Not sticky whatsoever. Its just wonderful...worth every penny and more, I cannot be without it!!"

For the price of this product, I would expect it to last until it runs out, not constantly break apart. It also doesn't have long-lasting effects. I felt like I had to put it on constantly.

I've continued to use this as a chapstick replacement and it's fantastic. I actually only need to use it 2-3 times a day and that is enough for my lips to feel moisturized. It is expensive, but if you've been burned by crappy chapsticks/lip moisturizers then this is worth it.

I got it in my Play box but would just not choose to buy it.  It is lightweight but that makes it feel cheap to me. I like something that has some weight and truly feels like its locking in moisture. I feel like this actually dries out my lips--I find myself needing to exfoliate often after using, in turn drying out my lips even more.  The slight tint is nice. The pros don't outweigh the cons for me though. I'll stick with my go-to lip treatments."

Either way, whatever it is, I amazed by this product, so much so that I canu2019t believe it, but I actually went and spent almost $30 on a chapstick, and I have zero regrets and 10/10 would do again. If you havenu2019t tried this brand yet and are looking for an amazing go-to chapstick, look no further, just bite the billet and GET IT!!"

I use this during the day but for $32, it doesn't hydrate or stay on my lips long enough. My lips still feel dry and seem to get more dry. I've had mine since last fall so I couldn't take it back. I talked to a girl at sephora about something for my lips and she suggested this and said it was quite popular. But when I said it's not hydrating enough and that I need more.. she told me she uses this lip balm and then puts on some of the Laneige lip mask on top. So I started doing that, too. Sucks I have to use 2 products to make this work. I won't replenish when mine is done. I'm better off getting a regular chapstick from the drug store."

I would have spent a lot more on cheaper stuff that i'd keep losing. but since it costed $26 i cherished it like a small child. and also, because it's frickin amazing. it tastes and smells amazing. it moisturizes my lips for so long and i don't have to reapply too much throughout the day. It really is healing too, in the winter and being sick lately my lips are so dry and peeling and this really brings them back to life. I'm just obsessed. So worth it. Much more valuable than buying a ton of cheaper chapsticks that i'd end up losing. Very smooth going on. I really love it."

I've used lots of lip balms, and this one's the priciest, but it's so worth it. A little goes a long way and the packaging it quality, the zip tube assures that it doesn't uncap in your purse and get balm everywhere.

My dog also loves eating chapstick and she can't just pop the lid off with this. The lid is a twist on so it doesn't just come off on accident. It is also incased in what I'm assuming is a metal tin instead of the normal plastic, I'm not sure if this will make it melt faster in the summers. Currently though, it gives the product a nice chill  that feels great when being put on.  My only gripes is that the flavor is... Weird? It's not bad but its definitely not good either.

For my lips, I felt like the lip balm sat on top of my lips as opposed to penetrating.  The pros of this product is that is last a while so within a 24 hr period  [on a windy cold winter day] I only needed to reapply once. It doesn't have a scent which is another pro. I have tried farmacy honey bees wax lip balm and I get a similar result for half the price and a deeper penetration.  This product is not a complete disappointment but Its not my fave. On the other hand,  I am obsessed with the fresh lip scrub and the fresh lip serum and I feel as though those products are a must have."

For some reason, Fresh's products doesn't break me out!   I've learned that pure beeswax doesn't show any allergic reaction in people because all propolis is removed. But when there are some that remains within the was mix, it can cause contact dermatitis. Which allows me to beleive that Fresh uses top notch beeswax in their ingredient when making their lip treatments.  So if YOU get a reaction to some lipbalm... trust that this one doesn't!

On the plus side no allergic reaction and I do have sensitive skin. It glides on very smoothly and the term sheer is accurate as I didnt really notice any color on my lips. That being said there was something very unpleasant about the taste and despite giving the product a decent try over a few days I found that it really did make my lips feel drier than before I applied. I own two lip masks in the $20-$25 range that are incredibly moisturizing with no unpleasant taste issues so I have no problem splurging on a lip product when it's worthwhile. To me this just isn't one of those products."

The texture is smooth and pleasing; it is substantial without being heavy or sticky, and it has a decent staying poweru2014 much better than most. The balm ingredients are hydrating and protective of the lips, with a mild citrus scent and a hint of sweetness. Truly provides a luscious, effective and pleasurable lip experience. Be careful in hot climates (esp cars) as this can melt. And tip: thereu2019s quite a bit of product left below the base of the container. I get a sample-sized container and narrow tool to scoop out the remainder to use (see photos below). Worth the hefty price tag, esp during VIB sales."

And for something thatu2019s $26, it really isnu2019t all that much different/better than the $14 jumbo organic lip balm I purchase from another brand that lasts me a year and never breaks. So while I have no complaints about this product itself, the aforementioned issues with packaging and value will prevent me from purchasing a full-sized version."

I had never used it before, so at first I was a little meh about the idea of a tinted lip balm in my box...it just didn't seem as exciting as an actual lipstick or something. Wow! I changed my mind really quick after using it for only a couple days.  This formula does indeed feel more like a lip therapy versus just a garden variety traditional lip balm. Where many of those lip balms always feel slightly heavy, this stuff feels light as a feather! It moisturizes wonderfully and glides on like silk...the best part is a little goes a LONG way. It works great by itself, and works especially well on top of one of my Benefit lip stains.   This was a pleasant surprise and I use it every day. Although it's kind of a steep price for lip balm, I can definitely see myself investing in the full size when my sample size runs out! Love!"

I'm a lip balm snob and I find that products like Chapstick and Carmex feel too waxy, greasy, etc. but these are delightful.  Pricey? Yes.  Worth it? Considering that I've purchased several...yes.  My recommendation is to buy them in a set, if possible, to maximize savings and to get a variety.  I'm hooked now."

So often when tint is added to an un-tinted product it throws the balance off or something. It's never quite the same. IDK, maybe I'm a hyper lip freak.) Anyway, it's the same! Still amazing. The tint is extremely light, don't expect much, it's just a hint. A hint of tint. This and Bite agave lip mask are the only two lip products I'll ever need (though not the only ones I'll ever want.)

And I love the white matte packaging!  Because the pink is so sheer, it really won't do anything to change or enhance your lip color.  Sometimes, I like a quick swipe/dab on my lips to moisturize and prime before lipstick application.   It's not heavy yet still very moisturizing.  Will repurchase!"

I got fed up and decided to splurge and get this product and Iu2019m so happy I did. My lips have felt plush and soft. Normally after a date with my boyfriend my lips feel dry and uncomfortable from all the making out, but using this that wasnu2019t the case. This product claims to finish the appearance of lines, but it wasnu2019t something I expected to see - I mean Iu2019m 22 - how big a different could it make? Apparently a huge one. I applied a matte lipstick yesterday and noticed that not only did it apply smoothly, but my lips looked so... unrealistically perfect. Almost like Iu2019d gotten lip filler. It genuinely looked like something off of Instagram. I purchased the tinted version, and while I normally love lipstick, this gives you the healthiest pick tint. Itu2019s gorgeous for those days you wanna look natural. A little cream blush, concealer and mascara and I think I look like a natural beauty. I canu2019t say enough about this product and will defintetly repurchase it when my tube runs out."

The color reminds me of that look of freshly scrubbed lips - like a little pink and full. It's not overpowering - it's just a hint of pink to brighten up the face.

If my flaky lips (winter, dehydration and iron deficiency are no joke) had a heart, it would have been jackhammering with nervous excitement. And then it would have exploded with delight upon buying the full size and discovering the excellent things about this: it glides on nicely, gets around easily with a screw cap to keep anything from getting in or out, and builds well with other occlusives to keep everything nice and smooth. Personally, I go for the SPF free version as I have other lip products with higher SPF strength to layer with but you do you.

Recently, I saw a picture fresh posted on their instagram about Meghan Markle using specifically this lip balm and it looked exactly like lip gloss! I've been into the glossy look, but it's hard finding something that is hydrating and glossy looking at the same time. I'm so glad I was able to come across that picture. The moment I saw it, I knew I had to get it and I've been using it since! It's such a hydrating lip balm and so moisturizing. Especially since it's the winter time and we all know how chapped our lips can be. Better yet, it smells amazing! Definitely my favorite lip balm."

It absolutely does both of those things for me. And when my lips get extra dry in the cold months I dab a bit of this on and seal with the bite agave lip mask to wake up to super soft lips"

I was a bit worried when I opened it and smelled a strong orange extract scent, given it's a skin irritant, but I thought I'd try it anyway, because I'd used lime-flavored lip balms without issue before. I used it for about a week, and my lips got worse: they went from a bit dry sometimes to actually chapped and peeling a little in the center of my bottom lip. I went back to my old nighttime lip balm (Carenel Lip Sleeping Mask) to see what would happen, and sure enough, my lips promptly returned to normal. Seeing how many great reviews this has, it's clear not everyone reacts as poorly as I do to orange extract, but if your lips are on the sensitive side, I'd suggest an unfragranced lip balm (or at least one without citrus oils)."

I have had flaky peeling lips for as long as I can remember. Here is what I did to fix it: After brushing your teeth you can also gently brush your lips(skip brushing lips if your lips have cracks/sores, it will still work but take longer to see change). You don't need a fancy lip scrub, this act alone softens and prepares your lips. Now, after all of that, pat dry your lips and apply chapstick immediately to seal in moisture. Do this for a while and you will have better lip days ahead. Applying chapstick without any kind of moisture will just make it sit on top of the cracked skin- but then you'll just have expensive lip salve. Anyway, I hope this helps my fellow luscious lipped beauts!"

It has a thin consistency that genuinely moisturizes your lips so that you don't have to reapply all day. It even works well to break down hard to take off liquid lipsticks. Just one swipe over the liquid lip and it easily comes off with a tissue.  Real talk though, I've been buying this product religiously for the last two years but have decided to stop buying this product until Fresh fixes the packaging. Once you get down to the bottom there is a TON of product left in the bottom plastic part. You are forced to either waste it or scoop it out with a qtip or cosmetic spatula. For the price and with so many other excellent lip balms on the market it is no longer worth it to me.  Also if you do buy this, be careful about keeping it in your car on a hot day.

So, I used this for a while, and even repurchased when I ran out. As with most Fresh products, I loved the scent, and the emphasis on feel-good, natural ingredients. The thing is, I don't think it helped much. First, I personally don't really like the texture: once on the lips, it is very thin and slippery, and I feel it exacerbates my lips' texture, instead of smoothing them like some other balms do. It also doesn't stay in place well if you tend to purse your lips. Second, it is very soft, melts easily, and a tube doesn't last long if you like to reapply lip balm several times in a day. Third, I feel this product sits on the lips more than it absorbs and treats; it's like I have dry lips under a slippery top layer. The time when I feel it did the most good is when I wore it overnight; my lips were softer the next morning. Of course, YMMV, but overall I feel like for severely chapped lips there are better, cheaper options out there. Sorry Fresh."

This is definitely pricey, but I find it to last considerably long, as I mostly  use it in the AM while getting ready. It makes a great balm to hydrate your lips prior to lipstick application as it really sinks in and will stay with you (most especially for under matte/liquid lips). For the cost i don't always carry this with me and prefer to alternate with another less pricey balm. However, I do think its worth the price to at least try once. It's also on the softer side so id skip carrying it in warmer climates /months."

I noticed after i put on a generous amount on my lips - approximately 40 minuets later my lips were dry and flaking from just sitting at my desk. I've never had a lip-balm do that to my lips before - so i returned it.   There were some pros about it though: It isn't highly scented, it doesn't leave a greasy or sticky feeling on your lips, which was nice.

I tried everything to get them back to their normal, soft selves. I drank loads of extra water in case I was just dehydrated. No change. I tried 2-3 different kinds of lip balms for a week each. No change. Nothing was working and my lips were painfully cracking and peeling.  I bought this and the lip polish and here I am a week later and my lips are almost completely back to normal! I used the scrub twice and used the lip treatment every day, multiple times a day. My lips are no longer cracking, and the old cracks are healing. I still don't know what caused it, I'm just so glad this seems to have made it stop!  I love this product and will be telling everyone I know about it. It's got a sweet, fruity smell and a nice, smooth texture that almost feels like Vaseline or something but not sticky like Vaseline is. It's a little more of an oily feel. It adds and retains moisture and lasts a pretty decent amount of time, unlike other brands that I felt like I was reapplying every 10-15 minutes. It's a little softer that most lip balms, so you want to be a little gentle with it when putting it on.  The tube is great quality, too. It's a sturdy metal tube that you screw on rather than popping it on and off. This ensures that it doesn't easily pop off when bouncing around the bottom of my purse.  Worth every dollar!!!"

I got this as a sample but will purchase it. I got the stick and the pot, no color and a color to try. The color needs to be more sheer - I don't like the way the color builds with each application. I don't like sticking my finger in a product to use it and the stick has some engineering problems that need to be solved.

I love this stuff. It's totally worth the money if you are having issues with dry lips."

Very hefty price tag, but for it being the only one that works for me, i'll buy it again."

I like to use this product at night before I go to sleep and when I wake up in the morning my lips are not only soft,  they feel plump, and I just can't give this enough stars it's an amazing product and I definitely recommend it if you have dry or chapped lips.    Also I have to recommend this to you if you are a liquid lipstick wearer.  We all know how Matte liquid lipsticks can really dry out the lips and give them a very raisin kind of texture. Using this balm after removing your liquid lipstick will help to restore your lips and reduce the amount of damage that those drying liquid lipsticks can cause ."

If anyone is taking Accutane (or any generic form), this is a life saver. I used a different product, from Sephora also, when on a lower dose but I wish I'd bitten the bullet and tried this sooner. It's worth the cost. Trust me. It's gentle and works like a charm."

I swear by it and assure the more budget conscious people I recommend it to that it is well worth the money, especially if they're like me and can't stand the feeling of their own cracked, peeling lips. It glides on smoothly and doesn't feel like a greasy film on your lips, and rarely turns to gunk in the corners of your mouth like some other lip moisturizers. It has a lovely smell, too, like the rest of Fresh's lip products. One of those items I always carry with me."

I didn't want to like it because of the price, but once I ran out of my deluxe sample, I realized nothing else came close :(  Just don't let it melt!  I keep mine in a mini fridge since I only use it overnight, but I've heard of people carrying it in their pocket or leaving it in a vehicle and having it melt.

Especially considering the price.  The texture is super smooth and melty (I wouldn't recommend keeping it in your pocket). And the smell and taste are sweet and somewhat lemony. Not unpleasant. It's a nice enough product, but I wouldn't buy it again or recommend it."

I recently tried the Dior Addict Lip Glow (which made my lips peel), so I had to apply this, and they immediately felt much better & more moisturized.

I used this in combination with the Fresh lip scrub and serum for seriously luscious, smooth and young lips. It's worth the $25 and for $2.50 more, better than the basic formula.

For a lack of better words, here's my take... Whatever ingredient they are using in the regular lip treatments with pigment that proves to be beneficial for lips... is MEGA CONCENTRATED in the advanced therapy lip treatment. It's almost as if the moisturizing granules are finer in this product, which makes the balm absorb into your lips instantly.  I love the colored lip treatments as well, but this is the serious, get-down-to-business sister of that product; no BS, no flair, just pure moisture and healing.  Really lives up to the name advanced therapy."

The container is sturdy- I've never had issues with it unscrewing in my bags or breaking. The only issue I've ever had with it is that it melts very easily due to how moisturizing it is.

I'm Canadian, and if it can beat an Albertan winter, you know it's the real deal! It does such a good job moisturizing that I don't have to reapply it constantly like other lip balms, which makes me feel better about the price, since it'll last longer. Sometimes I'll even put this on my lips pre-lipstick as a lip treatment, since I wear a lot of liquid lipsticks. Even just leaving it on for 10 minutes it'll do its job. The packaging is super sturdy, so I don't feel worried throwing it in my bag. Other lip balms the cap always falls off in my bag and gets dirty, this cap screws on so that's not an issue. I really can't see any flaws with this product, it's definitely the best lip balm I've ever used. It's so soft and creamy. Even my boyfriend noticed a difference in how soft my lips have been since I started using this. For something I just bought on a whim, I'm so so pleased with this. I wish I had something bad to say, but I don't! It's worth the price. I'll definitely buy this again once my current tube runs out."

I can tell a difference in the way my lips look; they're a supple and never flaky. I no longer have very pigmented lips either - just a nice, sheer pink. Love!! One of my favorite things about this chapstick is that it does it's job without leaving lips shiny/glossy. It's not matte, but it definitely doesn't leave your lips looking wet. The product really lasts, too. I find myself re-applying it less often than other chapsticks, which is nice. I know the price is a big deterrent for purchasing the product, but it works so, so well.

I've used two tubes consecutively of Advanced Therapy and I haven't seen an improvement. The only relief I get is when the product is physically on my lips. It's far too expensive for the short time relief it provides.  My sister used the same Advanced Therapy a few years ago and said it is different than how it is now. The ingredients may not have changed but the quality and proportions may have. Whatever it is, I find longer lasting relief from using raw coconut oil and Shea butter. That's too disappointing because the ingredients in Advanced Therapy was very promising."

My only gripe is the product is that it's so soft in the tube that as you apply it, the product will move and rub against the sides from the pressure of your lips and get a ring from where it touches against the tube opening marring the product. It's not a big enough gripe to dock a point off but it's something to note that this stuff is very soft and I can imagine if you rotated it out high enough while applying that you might just break the tip off so I'm careful to not treat it like my lipsticks by having it up too high and only have enough exposed at the top to apply when needed."

What I cannot stand about this is that it BREAKS in the packaging. It's in my purse all the time and it's not like I drop my purse or leave it in the car for it to melt, but both of the smaller versions of this product have sorta broken INSIDE the packaging.

Thirdly, applying the lip balm on the lips is like a dream! It honestly feels like I'm applying a warm butter on my lips that melts right away. I'm addicted to applying it because it's that amazing! But the reason I gave it three starts, and the reason I'm disappointed, is because I've been using this every night before bed for two months now, And my lips are still incredibly dry, and peeling every day still.

I use it under pencil for a nice, natural finish that lasts all day long without looking too glossy or being uncomfortably dry.  As an added bonus, it's moisturized the skin right above my lip, too, which tends to get a little dry and flakey in winter.  I don't see this as an expensive product, perhaps because it works so well with such a small amount of product applied. And because it doesn't make me react or make my skin burn or swell.

It feels good on your lips when you first put it on, but then 5 minutes later, your lips feel dry. It only lasted me about 2-3 weeks.. maybe because I had to keep reapplying because my lips kept feeling dryer and dryer. By the end of the tube, my lips had started to PEEL! I'm not blaming the product for that, it could be the weather, but it definitely did not make them better. I also just read the details on Sephora and found out it's supposed to be anti-aging and plump and smooth your lip area as well - definitely didn't do any of that either.  Don't waste your money!"

Nothing happened. Yes, this is more moisturizing than my usual night time balm (Burt's Bees beeswax lip balm) but the end results are still the same. Perhaps it's because I've literally just turned 15. Maybe this treatment will actually make a difference on aged or damaged lips. I'll use this mini up, but I won't be repurchasing.

In Cleveland, it gets very cold, and this product is excellent at keeping my lips soft and beautiful 24/7. I am a true believer in this product, and the company in general, for making quality one of their main priorities. The only thing I do wish could be changed, is the amount that is given. I bought the Fresh Sugar Lip Treatment SPF 15 in August, and I am already running low.

Fresh Sugar Advanced Lip Treatment is expensive in my opinion, as I finished using it in less than a month.

I have chronically dry lips and the regular one was the only balm that previously helped them. This one has made a major impact in only a few days! My lips are so soft. Silky. They haven't peeled or been flaky since I started using this (a common occurrence for me - even in warm months). This balm does everything it claims to. My lips look more plump...younger and fresher. My friend asked what lip color I am wearing yesterday...and I didn't have anything on but this. I think it is improving the natural color of my lips, as well. I've started using this in conjunction with their Serum and my lips look and feel better than ever. Both are definitely worth the cost."

I recomed this product to anyone who wants natural looking, baby - soft, plump and hydrated lips without any hassel...simply apply 2 times a day, a thin layer is all that's needed , and forget about it.

I use this after I exfoliate my lips and I tell you if I use this every night before bed I don't have any chapping or discomfort through an entire 12 hour work day.

I have some slight discoloration (lighter coloring) on the inner part of my upper lip and this product appears to be correcting this issue! I wish I had taken before and after pictures.

However, if you are thinking that this is going to be the end-all-be-all of lip balms, you'd be wrong. Smith's Rosebud Balm is actually cheaper, and better, if you're the type who NEEDS lip balm."

I'm not sure why that happened, but I ended up getting great results, and believe me, it is HARD for me to get nice, silky, smooth lips, and I've tried tons of other products.  Having said all that, I'm still not sure if I will re-purchase because the product does run out very quickly, I've already gone through half the tube and it is really expensive, so $28 a month may be a bit too much to spend on lip balm."

The only problem with this overall great product is that it melts really easily, I live in a relatively warm area and walking around town with it in my purse would lead to melting. This was in about 80-100 degree weather in which there is no humidity. I was covered inside of a beige purse, it wasn't like it was laying out in the sun. I have extremely flaky and dry lips. Besides practically medicated lip balms that I have to put on every 15 minutes this nothing had ever worked before this product. This product 100% changed that . It only needed to be applied every hour for me although I obviously wanted to apply it more because it tasted so good. After using my sample size for a month I had nearly perfect lips.

My lips were incredibly dry and cracked at the time, so it wasn't an instant miracle when I tried it, but it did provide more relief that I had gotten from chapstick, so I purchased both items.  Can I just tell you that I am amazed by these products! I've used the Sugar Lip Polish 3 times in the past 3 weeks, and I use the Sugar Advanced Therapy lip balm daily. My lips are AMAZING!

After being recommended this product in store, I purchased it knowing that Sephora provides it's customers an industry leading return policy.  I immediately noted the extreme softness of the product, it applied with a silky smooth feeling, wasn't too tacky or greasy. It tasted good, and stayed on even after licking my lips and eating/drinking.

Let me start off by saying that I think this is a good product, but it is certainly not my holy grail lip balm.  Pros: - The tube is well constructed, solid, and feels very sturdy. - It moisturises my lips. - Doesn't feel greasy or sticky. - It has a pleasant smell and taste (a very light lemon scent and taste).  Cons: - I have to keep reapplying it (even after not eating, drinking, or licking my lips). My lips are not dry or chapped at all to begin with, so I'm not sure why I seem to have this issue. It does moisturise my lips in the little time that it lasts, but no better than some much cheaper lip balms that I've tried. - The price. At $28 CAD, its really pricey. Given how many times I have to reapply it, I will go through this product fairly quickly.  Overall, I think its just your average lip balm. I will not be repurchasing this. I'm not blown away by its performance. Having tried many others, my favourites are still the lip balms by Burt's Bees and Jack Black. In my opinion, they perform much better and are not nearly as expensive.  I hope your experience with this product is better than mine."

I tried EVERYTHING, and after a month, my lips were still peeling and dry, and the irritation had spread to my skin at the corner of my lips. I put an intensive healing cream on my lips, which began to heal them. However, I was using a lip balm with lanolin in it, and it was not allowing my lips to heal properly. I got this in the Fresh Skin Savers kit during the 20% off sale at Sephora, and it is AMAZING. Love it. It is very luxurious feeling. The reason for only 4 stars is the price. Very high. It looks like Fresh puts this in with lots of kits and gift sets though, so I'll likely grab one of those up and get it again!"

The chapped symptoms disappear immediately after the first few applications, and my lips are fuller after about 10 days of use, 3-4 times a day. I apply a thick layer in the morning after I have eaten breakfast & brushed my teeth, a quick swipe once or twice mid-day, and a final generous coat just before going to sleep (again, after brushing my teeth).  I live in San Diego, which can get very, very dry during fall and winter. I am so glad I found this product just in time for all this dry weather... and the holiday photos, haha. I'm 24 and usually do not wear any lip gloss or lipstick, but having my lips finally healed has given me the confidence to finally start looking into trying some out :)  Buying this is hands down the best thing I have ever done for my lips. Yes, it is expensive, but so is blowing through 21984129 tubes of Burt's Bees or other generics. I am noticing I actually use the Sugar treatment *less* after awhile because my lips are healing (not getting addicted to the product). I am looking forward to keeping this as part of my regular beauty regimen."

I literally applied only twice today and WOW my lips looks so luscious. I thought and in fact knew this would be just another regular lip balm but i had to try heard so many good reviews. Honestly, I am throwing away all my cheap and even not so cheap ones. this one is a WINNER!!!! MY LIPS LOOKED SO FULL too!!!! i did moistorize well good before i sleep but i did that all my life. THIS ONE REALLY IS EFFEctive!!! and stays and protects!!!! I LOVEEEEEE WILL CONTINUE BUYING FOREVER. I didn't experience any mushing or lip treatment breaking just apply lightly. don't press hard. it is delicate but so effective.!!!!! totally recommend and totally in love!!!!"

This Advanced Therapy is worth the price when you add up all of the chap sticks you buy at other places yet never finish the tube, these are the only lip balm/treatment product that I've EVER finished and repurchased! I usually use this one in the morning under lipstick and at night before bed. I have definitely noticed that my lips look fuller, the wrinkles that most people have on their lips have smoothed down nicely and recently I got a lip piercing that I couldn't use any lip product that wasn't natural (a vertical labret). This not only kept me from having terrible chapping during the healing process but actually aided in the speed of healing! I will continue to purchase the Fresh Sugar lip products, they are definitely second to none :) Highly recommended!!"

Big thing to note: Maybe 1/5th of the product is in the base, so once you've used it to the point where you can't apply it as normal, use a makeup brush to scoop out the rest, or you'll waste a lot of product (and money).

I left mine in my purse for a moment in the car, when I came back it was melted into an unusable goo that I couldn't twist up to use anymore. Tho, its great that it didn't leak and explode all over my purse on its way out.

With high prices come high expectations. This delivers on every front. It's just so pleasant in areas where others are not. It glides on effortlessly and evenly, it smells nice without being remotely perfumey, it has a subtle lemony flavor (like other Fresh Sugar products), and it just plain works. Also, it does not contain SPF, which is important to me as I am very sensitive. Any lip product with SPF ultimately dries my lips out, thus rendering that product useless as a balm. I also really like the packaging - it's a white, metal lipstick tube with a bottom that screws on and off for added security. No putting your fingers into a messy tub or trying to spread balm evenly with a squeeze-tube applicator. Just apply like lipstick and wait for the magic. It really softens and moisturizes more than any other balm I've tried (and I have a drawer full that range from drugstore to high-end). Also, the texture is perfect. Not at all heavy or waxy, but like a layer of silk on the lips. It melts in, but still leaves your lips feeling moisturized and not like you need to reapply. It works well under lipstick and on its own. I guess they know what this balm is worth. I really did not want to fall in love with a $25 lip balm, but it happened. You've been warned."
