The third day I used it- applied it at night and woke up in the morning with a dark scar right on my face. My skin is sensitive but I never had a dark scar like that which looks like it is permanent. You need to be careful with this product if you have sensitive skin prone to scars. This product is meant for those skin types though so I am extremely frustrated now that I have that new spot on my face which people notice"

I like it was hurting so bad I couldn't even open it. it was burning and burning and itching and burning and holy moly and then turns out it was fine after all. but I even woke up this morning and I still was burning a little bit. I will admit it does give My face, some instant brightness or whatever, but it's definitely not worth it for the expensive price. I would not recommend this. Oh and it smells very strong like acidity like vinegar type."

The only thing is that I don't use much so I am worried about this being clean and going rancid before I finish it like my old HG Herbivore -- hence 1 star docked."

The transformative power of this serum is evident; it has not only softened my skin but also improved its texture remarkably. I second all the reviews saying that a little bit goes a long way! I've had my current full size for almost a year, which does make the price point more economical. I couldn't recommend it more for anyone seeking a skincare staple that delivers on its promises without irritation."

Iu2019ve religiously purchased these two products and also gifted them because they work so incredibly well. Unlike countless other products Iu2019ve purchased, these give me fresh, glowing, anti-aging results that more than justify the costs. I also find it impressive that a few pumps is more than plenty to treat my face, neck and decollete. Iu2019m doing my Sunday night Luna + GG mask as I write this review because I need to add more to my basket. I purchase once a year and use them every other night and GG most mornings to prep my face for makeupu2014thatu2019s how little I use to get awesome results!GG is so moisturizing I rarely wear moisturizer overtop except in dry winter months. This is the best and most gentle regular exfoliating treatment Iu2019ve ever triedu2014love it!"

Itu2019s disappointing how expensive the product is, but during the sale I purchased the largest size. It comes in a glass bottle instead of the deceiving tiny plastic container that the smaller sizes come in. The serum does have a tingly effect but it doesnu2019t bother my sensitive skin.

The Good Genes was the first SR product I tried. While I admit I am not a person who stares at my pores or discoloration, I know this stuff works. I can feel it in my skin texture and how it feels 24/7. No little dry patches that call our for rough exfoliation, no dead skin cells bunching up under tinted moisturizer.

            "review_text": "When it comes to Alpha Hydroxy Acids my skin prefers Lactic over Glycolic any day, as it's gentler, and this formula containing Lactic plus Licorice and a host of botanicals is good stuff! I try not to use anything containing AHA's during the daytime as I'm never convinced I've reapplied my SPF sufficiently to protect against the strong Florida sun. For that reason I use it on a night time only. The texture of Good Genes is light and would suit most skin types I'd imagine, other than possibly sensitive. Having an oilier skin type myself, I find I usually don't need to use a moisturizer once I've applied this as it hydrates sufficiently on its own. Results-wise: I found my skin tone generally brighter within a week of starting use and also it feels much smoother - definitely down to the Lactic Acid. It does contain silicones, however they are thankfully much further down the ingredients list then most silicone-containing products. I came across concerns in other reviews about the 'essential oils' in the formulation so I did a spot of detective work... of the 2 oils in here, Meadowfoam Seed Oil is a non-photo toxic carrier oil and Lemongrass oil is an essential oil, although not a photo toxic one either, and therefore no reason for concern. I have tried the 'Glycolic' version of 'Good Genes' too, which I purchased in the UK but found it to be too strong, the Lactic acid formulation we have here in the states suits me much better.   ~ My Sephora Top 7 must-have list ~  (My top 7 must-have beauty products of all time, focusing mainly on my purchases at Sephora)  1.

I personally feel like I'm starting to look it faster and faster these days. I was looking for a product to help smooth fine lines and wrinkles, and of course slow the clock down as much as possible.   Due to the rave reviews I have read about Sunday Riley, especially the Luna, I was excited to try all of her products. Around Christmas I purchased 2 of the go to bed with me sets. I felt like this was a good cost effective measure to get a real test run on the whole system (cleanser, essence, A+, 5 star, Luna, Good Genes and Ice).   $200 later and a few months, I'm here to report that I'm not impressed. I'm not sure what the hype is about. I didn't see any improvement from the A+, 5 star, Luna, Ice, or Good Genes. Maybe it is just not right for my skin but I honestly think whether it was right for me or not, there should have been some effect or minor improvement. My only other complaint is about the Luna, it doesn't soak in, you go to bed slimy.   On the other hand, the two products I didn't expect to really care about but ended up really liking are the essence (Pink Drink) and the cleanser (Ceramic Slip). Still, I don't expect I will be purchasing them. It's a consideration in the future. Right now I'm over Sunday Riley and will continue my search for my skincare unicorn."
