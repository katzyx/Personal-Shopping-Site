The sample size was a tiny bottle, perfect for travel so I decided to throw it into my toiletry bag while packing for a trip.  After washing my hair and using this product just one time, my hair felt amazing & shiny, not weighing it down or feeling clumpy like some other products. I love it so much, I'm going to order a full size!     To give some idea about my hair condition: I have thick, slightly wavy, just past shoulder-length color treated hair (highlights), dark brown hair with blondish highlights and regular touchups at the roots.  About twice per year I get my highlights redone.  My hair has gotten drier from color treatments and some of the products I was using seemed to weight my hair down, and with my workouts 5 times per week, i use dry shampoo, and doing my best not to do a full wash/blow dry/heat treatment more than once per week.  Despite all of that, still some dryness."

            "review_text": "So I bought this because it protects hair up to 450 degrees and I got tired of trying heat protecting sprays and other serums because the products are either to heavy or not as heat protecting as I want.  Its been AMAZING and will be a repeat purchase until I die. However, this product should be used post shower with a styling tool or blow-dry to get the results you expect. This won't do much if you don't apply the correct amount of serum per your hair density and hair type. I have LONG, THICK, WAVY hair and I noticed that after the shower, if I apply one dropper to 6 sections of hair, my hair can go literally 5 days without a wash because my hair stays perfect. If you pair this with a blowout, you hair will look perfect for a few days without the damage or salon costs.  Since using this product, my hair: rarely ever dry - stays shiny and protected for multiple days its less tangled protects my hair when I heat blowdry seen less split ends.   This serum isn't going to magically fix your hair if your hair if your hair has major problems, however with good application, it can mitigate damage while protecting the hair state you currently have.  cons/problems to consider:  1. the more hair you have, the more you need to use and 45 dollars can be a lot of money if buying on a regular basis. 2. The dropper can be annoying because to get the full amount you need to squeeze it twice 3. this is a long, skinny, glass cylinder - if you knock over this thing, she will roll and might break - please be mindful.  Would rate this a 4.5/5 because of cons, but since it really works for me I'm bumping it to  a 5/5. Feel free to give this a buy - just to try out.  xoxo babes, hope this review helps!"

I tried this out for two months and it does absolutely nothing. I tried to use it on its own, mixed with leave-in conditioner, and as part of my hair mask but it doesn't seem to do anything. The packaging is pretty, but it's not functional and my dropper broke towards the end of two months leaving glass in the container. I've never hated a product this much. Given how much it costs and how little you get, I would honestly stay far away from it. There are much better hair products on the market that are way cheaper. Would not recommend."

I blow dry my hair every time I wash it and I've never been able to have same day non-frizzy hair until now. I also live in a wet climate which my hair doesn't love. Now, I can wash and blow dry my hair when it's raining out and it's literally not a problem in terms of frizz.
