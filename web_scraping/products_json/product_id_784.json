    "how_to_use": "Suggested Usage:.-Like perfume or eau de toilette, cologne is a fragrance designed to be worn on the skin..-Spritz generously onto your wrists, neck, and pulse points\u2014your body heat will help to diffuse the scent as the day goes on..-After applying your cologne, avoid rubbing or dabbing skin. This breaks down the fragrance, causing it to wear off more quickly.  .-If you prefer placing fragrance on your wrists, be sure to reapply after frequent handwashing, as this tends to rinse off the scent. .-Replace your fragrance after 12 months. Expired perfumes more than a year old lose the integrity of the original scent.",

I\u2019ve always been a heavy fan of myrrh & tonka. I\u2019m glad I did purchase this. The bottles are cute and mini. Great for keeping in my purse and I am now a fan of all 3 fragrances so I WILL be purchasing full bottles of the other 2"

I enjoyed 2 of the 3 fragrances. The one that I was not a fan of was due to the fact I felt like it was a masculine fragrance. I honestly pawned it off in my fiance. He loves it, and it smells divine on him. I'm just glad it was a win-win for everyone, and the additional fragrance didn't get thrown to the wayside"

            "review_text": "I bought this set the other day as I've been seeking out some longer last, cold-weather fragrances. I like Jo Malone fragrances, but always think they don't last long enough. So far, I've worn the Scarlett Poppy, and it is wonderfully floral and sweet. The other two are more floral/woodsy and sweet/smokey. All would be great unisex fragrances. I only sprayed once on each inner elbow and once behind my neck/hair. It wasn't overpowering and lasted a good deal of time. The perfumer behind Myrrh & Tonka and Scarlett Poppy also concocted NEST's Lychee Rose, BDK's Gris Charnel, and Snif Rose Era. Longevity is good; 6+ hours."
