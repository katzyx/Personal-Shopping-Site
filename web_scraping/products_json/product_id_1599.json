This was my first time seeing the new refillable packaging. I am so disappointed! Iu2019ve always viewed Tatcha as a more prestigious brand with excellent products and luxurious like packaging. Unfortunately, I canu2019t say the same about this new container. Itu2019s lightweight and looks awful. Thereu2019s plastic ridges all around the rim which accentuates the cheaper material. Thereu2019s even a picture and writing talking about the refill permanently on the container making it look way worse. If I didnu2019t know about this change, I wouldu2019ve been 100% convinced that someone swapped my product out and I received a counterfeit one. If youu2019re new to this product, you have no idea what you missed out on. Thankfully, I can swap the moisturizer out of this container to my older version. I understand the need to help the environment, but this was clearly an opportunity to cheapen their cost while disguising it as a positive change."

After back-and-forth with several associates and being gaslighted into believing that I ordered a product I never bought that apparently and very conveniently disappeared from the website, they told me to leave a review instead of solving the problem like any other company would.  Unlike them I do have receipts, so beware this can happen."

I tried it for a week to make sure my face didn't break out like some reviewers had mentioned, and it was so incredible that I ordered the largest size and have been using it ever since. I'll definitely keep purchasing, because even my Clarins cream wasn't cutting it anymore. Since I started menopause, my normal type skin has been so dry, especially under my eyes, no matter how much water I drink or how well I take care of my skin. I didn't know this brand, but my colleague who really knows face cream brands told me afterwards that this is one of the best she knows, and she's right. It's a steep price but it's worth it if you need super moisturizing cream that leaves your skin dewy and soft. Normally I wouldn't waste it on the neck and du00e9colletu00e9 region either, but it really makes my 53-year old skin look supple and young. The cream is so soft and creamy that it's like a spa experience in a little pot, I feel spoiled."

The cream straight from the brand is amazing but this review is not going to be about the efficacy of the product. It's going to be about the fact that I bought the cream from Sephora and had it shipped to me only to find out that the packaging is nothing like the product from Tatcha, which makes me realize that Sephora is a big faker! I don't know where they got this from but it most certainly is NOT Tatcha!! The jar is much smaller and more to the point much lighter, meaning it looks and feels exceedingly FAKE! it doesn't have its normal expiration stamp on the bottom nor does it have the fold out ticket where you can read info on the product either. The jar pretty much feels like a Dewy skin cream from Temu and it is infuriating! The worst part is that I can't even return it nor get a refund because I do not live in a country that has access to Sephora, so you can imagine how hard it was for me to acquire it! I've gotten this cream quite a few times over the years so I know exactly how the product is supposed to be like, I also got another Tatcha cream from Amazon that is very clearly from Tatcha and comparing the two, who are supposed to have the same jars despite being different creams, makes it very clear that something is very wrong! I never knew that Sephora would be producing and selling fake products NOT from the brands themselves! it certainly does not make me want to be a Sephora customer anymore, and I've been one now for almost 5 years!! In the pictures you can clearly see that the jars are very different in sizes and the ticket on the back is not close to being the same, the Dewy one even has some number stamp on it which very obviously proves that it's a fake! I was going to put more pictures, including ones where you could see the fold off ticket on the real jar, that you can't see on the fake Dewy jar but apparently you can only put 2 pictures with your review, for some reason!"

            "review_text": "From research based upon the brand and product from a Licensed Esthetician perspective While Tatcha is widely praised for its luxurious skincare products inspired by Japanese beauty rituals, there are a few reasons why some people might find the brand unsuitable for their needs:  Price Point: One of the primary criticisms of Tatcha is its high cost. Many of its products are significantly more expensive than other skincare brands, making it less accessible to the average consumer. Some users feel that the pricing does not always justify the results, especially when comparable products exist at a lower price point.  Fragrance: Tatcha products often contain fragrance, which can be an irritant for sensitive skin. Though the brand uses natural fragrances, even these can sometimes cause reactions, particularly for those with skin conditions like eczema or rosacea.  Minimal Active Ingredients: Some critics argue that Tatcha's products focus more on luxury and sensory experience than on potent, scientifically proven active ingredients like retinol or high percentages of vitamin C. This could make Tatcha products less effective for individuals seeking targeted skincare solutions for concerns like aging, acne, or hyperpigmentation.  Over-Hyped Marketing: Tatcha has a significant celebrity following and substantial marketing that emphasizes luxury and tradition. Some users believe that the brand is overhyped and that the actual efficacy of the products does not always match the lofty claims made by the brand's marketing efforts.  Heavy Emollients: Some Tatcha products contain heavier oils and emollients, which may not be suitable for people with oily or acne-prone skin, as these ingredients can be comedogenic for certain skin types.  While Tatcha may be a great fit for some, itu2019s important to evaluate whether the formulations and price align with your individual skincare needs."

I just think that decision was tone deaf on their actual customer base. Any time I'd get a sample size or if there was a super sale on the 1.7 I would literally do the math and if it was a better price I'd buy it THEN TRANSFER it to my 2.5oz jar. I LIKE THE BIG JARS. I think this kinda stuff is a poor attempt at trying to look eco friendly but in reality it's STILL NOT WHAT WE WANT and you're creating MORE plastic by putting in the smaller size. Like I said, nobody who has used this cream for the last 3+ years is buying 1.7 jars anymore. If I did buy a refill pod, I'd be transferring it to my 2.5oz jar anyway so WHY not make the refill pod in a 2.5?!"

Instead, my skin broke out in little red bumps, and I developed dry, flaky patches on my cheeks and the outer corners of my mouth.  I was in denial at first, thinking it couldnu2019t be this cream that had worked so well for me in the past. However, the evidence became undeniable as my skin condition worsened. Iu2019m now left with dark spots where the dry patches were, and Iu2019m struggling to heal my skin and restore it to its former state.  This experience has severely impacted my self-confidence. It's incredibly disappointing to see such a drastic negative change from a product that used to be a staple in my skincare routine.

And can we take a moment for the packaging? It's like they bottled up a piece of heaven in that beautiful purple jar. It makes my skincare shelf look so fancy, I almost feel bad hiding it away in my bathroom! ud83dude02  But wait, there's more!

I had high hopes because I've heard so much about it, but even with proper skin prep that includes exfoliating, vitamin C, etc. I felt that very little of this product actually absorbed into my skin. I have normal skin tending to dry at its worst so I had hoped it would feel weightless and soak in as the product description suggests. It felt like a mask and throughout the day, with no other moisturizer application, I found that my skin felt sticky or dewy as the name does suggest. I continued using this product for a month and tried different application techniques also, but still felt like the product sat on my skin and wiped off all benefits by the end of the day. While this was not the outcome I hoped for, this is not to say that the 'dewy' look might be what others hoped for, just not what I wanted in a daily moisturizer.  Some positives about the product are cute packaging and I really appreciate the application stick for getting the product out of the container."

The applicator that comes with it is super helpful when applying to minimize waste, I just scoop a pea sized amount and then dab a little to each quadrant of my face then rub in. I have combination skin and I find that this is lightweight enough that it doesn't make me oily in my T zone, just making my skin feel dewy and soft, while also being strong enough for my dry patches. I also like that the fragrance is quite subtle. I don't regularly break out (just some hormonal spots) and I find that this doesn't give me pimples. 4/5 stars instead of 5/5 because the price point is a bit high."

However, for this moisturizer I only had to put on very little and I still felt the hydration.  After a couple of days, I started to notice that my skin was feeling softer and I did notice some dewiness to my face.  I hadn't realized it was a dewy skin cream at first.  The mini size lasted me about two weeks since I didn't need much product. A small amount really does work and I feel better hydration that my other moisturizer.  I did buy the value size, and I feel that this will last me a year if not more.  There is no need to add more as I already feel it working and hydrating.  I would recommend this product!"

A little goes a very long way so the product does last longer than other moisturizers. I have very sensitive, dry, eczema prone skin, and I have autoimmune conditions affecting my skin. This doesn't irritate it at all, and it's often messaged in support forums as somehow very soothing despite containing fragrance, normally a huge no no for the sensitive skin girlies. I notice immediate improvement after using. Love the effect in combination with the rice wash."

This moisturizer just never went into my skin. And lastly, I got dryness around my chin and would peel. This wasnu2019t the moisturizer for me!

This cream is not geal, like I'm used to, and it's reach and creamy, but not at all heavy. I finally have hydrated skin that doesn't flake in the middle of winter in NYC! And the plumping effect works! I'm 29 and recently started noticing small changes in my skin (aka aging). I developed thick wrinkles on my forehead and started using retinol serum. Combined with this cream my wrinkles are all smoothed out, I'm sure no one except me can see them now. Cheeks also look better, generally skin is less dull. Will continue using."

Iu2019ve never been good at having loyalty to any one product because I love trying new things but tatcha was my exception, it made my skin noticeably better. I was getting compliments on my skin! I purchsed a new container maybe 6 months ago and slowly started to develop dermatitis. I was using TRET at the time so I assumed it was that, never even considering it could be my tatcha moisturizer. I removed all harsh products from my skin care including the tret, even going as far as not using cleanser to wash my face, to no avail, my skin was getting worse not better. Finally this past week I decided to stop using my tatcha and only use cerve on my face a lo and behold after nearly 6 months of red inflamed, flaky and embarrassing skin my skins finally getting better and seems to be healing. I donu2019t think itu2019s a coincidence that my healing came after I stopped using this product. I really really want to believe there was some error in the batch or perhaps a formula change as Iu2019ve seen other reviews with similar stories.

Tatcha, I am so disappointed because I am thinking of switching to another brand even tho I loved this one. I hope you change it back to the old formula."

I buy a mix of professional grade skincare and Sephora products, as I feel most off-the-shelf products don't have the power I need. That said- if I could pick one product to put in everyone's Sephora basket, it would be this one. It does have a scent, but I've come to look forward to it. I use it layered with other products, both in the morning and at night. It never pills up or sits on the surface- it moisturizes deeply. I prefer this cream to much more expensive options, and I'm so reassured by Tatcha's continued commitment to clean beauty. This cream immediately evens out my sensitive spots and hyperpigmentation, and keeps my skin dewy all day. If I could afford to bathe in this, I would."

I have so much of it left because I only use it on an everyday basis in the winter months because my skin gets incredibly dry. I tried so many lotions before The Dewy in hopes of not having to have dry, tight, flaking skin patches constantly in the winter. This is the first lotion that moisturizes my face all day long and into the evening and completely gets rid of any flaking skin & the tight feeling. Oh, and a little goes a LONG way with this one. I love the lotion spoon it comes with because it helps prolong the lotions shelf life by not having to contaminate it with whatever residues & possible bacteria your fingertips put into the lotion, but also it's so awesome for making sure you don't overuse. All you need is a tiny amount for each area of your face. Too oily for day use & under makeup, though. Also it doesn't need to be as expensive as it is."

I could not be happier with this. I eyed it for years and just could not get over the price point for some reason even though two of my other favorite face creams are a lot more expensive than this so when I finally realized that there was a mini - I just couldn't say no to missing out anymore. To be fair, when people complain about the size of this mini, I just don't get it - it lasted me almost three months and that was using a decent sized dollop in the morning and night. This is a heavier formula (mid-weight range I would say) that means you do not have to add an excessive amount and this is coming from someone with the most intense dry facial skin at times. This has a light fragrance that can be found with all of Tatcha's products so I would recommend trying to smell a sample if you are sensitive to this area of a product. I feel smoothed out after applying without the tacky feeling and it also does not make me feel oily or mess with my other skin prep that I do before putting on a full face of makeup. I have about two days worth left in my container and I will be putting a full size in my cart today to purchase."

Everytime I try a tatcha product it gives me cysts which is rare. Not sure why, seems to be very pore clogging. Yes I also tried the blue moisturizer as well on multiple occasions-Its a shame as this product made me glow, just very bumpy and swollen.

This Tatcha moisturizer has a similar creaminess, but the fragrance is STRONG. 2 - When I've been out in the sun, or have irritation on my skin (I'd classify as semi-sensitive), this burns.

I have extremely dry skin and moisturize frequently. I typically use this during the day. It lasted me 5-6 months. I used another moisturizer at night.  I first tried Tatcha a while back, but did not see the hype. Even when I had acne-prone skin, the water cream wasn't really worth the price tag. I would say this is a better product than the water cream IMO.  If you find the product getting a little tacky/hard to spread, you should mix it with a ceramide toner/essence/whatever to help spread it out."

I usually don't care for scents, but the light lavender smell is so pleasant and pretty. I give my friends facials so they can get the experience and a free massage from the homie. lol.

However, after 2 or so days of using this I noticed I was breaking out on my forehead and I ignored it thinking it was something else in my skincare routine. Then after I noticed the break out on my forehead a day later I began to break out on my cheek and got a couple big pimples on my cheeks, chin, forehead, etc.  After trying to find out what was breaking me out I realized it was most likely this product after reading other reviews. I took it out of my skincare routine and my breakouts were gone within the week. This product broke so many other people out. It's definitely not worth your money if you have sensitive skin. My skin is dry and sensitive, so I thought this would help with my dry spots, and yes it did moisterize my face but I can get the same effect with a cheaper and better moisturizer that won't break me out. I also wore this throughout the day and I thought I was sweating. Nope. It was the moisturizer. I would touch my face and see just dewy residue on my hands that I couldnt wipe away. It also made me feel like I was sweating and had a somewhat nasty feel when I was outside for a while. Waste of money."

This magical skin cream was at the top of my price budget list. I do have to say I did try a sample months ago, from an online order, but after it was gone, I went back to my usual because it was cheaper.  Nearing the end of my regular moisturizer & tired of the flaky patches, I decided to give this a shot, it's worth every penny and last so much longer than my old one which was the same amount QTY wise, but I had to use three times the amount. A little of this cream goes a very long way, it's creamy, without being heavy, absorbs well, yet leaves my skin feeling very hydrated all day long. My foundation applies flawlessly over it, without pilling and without flaky patches showing up once I've applied foundation on my skin & it's settled, which was a huge problem with my other long time moisturizer. There is nothing like feeling great going out the door only to realize, your make-up is flaking off. This no longer happens, because with THIS - my skin is hydrated, ALL DAY! It's the one this I changed from my whole routine.  I'm turning 50 and while I've been very lucky to not have a lot of wrinkles for my age. As I mentioned, I do have combo skin, not a lot of breakouts, normal skin in most areas but those scaly dry skin patches and redness have vanished within days of using this cream.   I love reading everyone's reviews, but I rarely see reviews for woman my own age and up - so I hope you ladies 49 and up, give this product a try if you are having similar issues."

Then, shortly into using this product, I started to develop an acne-like rash that would not go away no matter what I did. I had never struggled with acne before and my skin looked terrible so I was concerned. I went to the dermatologist and was diagnosed with perioral dermatitis. The doctor said this can be caused by certain moisturizers. I emailed tatcha and was told it might not work for every skin type but it was dermatologist tested so I thought maybe my skin was just too sensitive for it. I gave the rest of the product to my friend since I could no longer use it, and shortly after he developed periocular dermatitis. It was so strange that the same condition happened to both of us within months and the only connection we can make is this moisturizer. Itu2019s also strange because this condition happens mostly in women and he is a man. We had to get on antibiotics and use a prescription cream and it was such a pain to get rid of. I DO NOT recommend this product. There are so many amazing and clean products out there and this is not one of them. If you want moisturizer thatu2019s good for your skin look into La Rouche Posay or Cera Ve."

A little goes a very long way, and I'd recommend emulsifying the product before use by warming it in your hand and rubbing it before applying so that it isn't quite so thick and pore clogging.

The product doesn't sit on the skin and remain greasy but seems to absorb well. I like that the fragrance is mild and seems mainly natural. You can smell the thyme extract. The ingredients seem quite unique, which I like. I haven't been using this long or consistently enough to say if I'd buy it but I think it's pretty good. I think the pH of the cleanser was a little higher than ideal. I'd be curious to check the pH of the cream.  I typically go for the skin care gift at my birthday and last year was laniege-a brand I wasn't impressed by and wouldn't purchase from. Tacha impressed me more and I think it's great that Sephora has this program as it would be quite difficult to make good choices otherwise. Ingredient lists are also very insightful."

I switched over to using beef tallow balm from VanMan Company about a month ago and it has done absolute wonders for my face. If you have acne prone skin, combination, or just dry skin I highly recommend looking into VanMan Company because itu2019s all clean products and my skin looks great. No breakouts, no dry patches, my acne scars are starting to disappear and you definitely get your moneys worth."

I have extremely dry skin and use this when I wake up after applying night time healing products. In the past, most moisturizers have dried me out or irritated my skin when applied. But, his cream gives me a very hydrated looking finish and does not irritate me at all. In addition, I have had no breakouts or additional pimples due to this cream. 100% recommend!"

I re-purchased this moisturizer and it's so sticky. The consistency is different. It does not hydrate my skin at all, in fact it feels just like a cheap lightweight moisturizer. This is really disappointing and I hope it gets fixed soon. I have seen complaints about these expensive brands hiking up their prices but cheapening their formula, and I now believe it. Something is definitely not right here."

I, however, noticed that while this works well by itself, I can not use it with other products as it starts pilling. Including after the Rice wash cleanser. So I use this as a morning moisturizer and the cleanser at night with my Hyaluronic acid serum. I did purchase the Gratitude size on Tatcha's website. I have yet to use that as I still have my sample so I am curious to see if there is a difference in formula between both sizes like people are saying.

I had same problem when I gave it a try because I did not want to waste that money. Thats where my second complaint comes in. $22 for not even half an oz is ridiculously overpriced. It would be better not to even get involved with this skincare line because you have to pay out the rear to keep up with your skincare routine. Definatly not worth the price or the hype."

It delivered results, especially given the cold, dry weather where I live. My skin stays soft but not overly oily all day, but it also doesn't give me that tacky, there's-stuff-on-my-face feeling. Reason 2: it is fragranced but it's not strong, I don't find I can smell it after it's applied. If you have sensitive skin keep that in mind. Reason 3: I used it under the IT cosmetics CC cream and also with a smashbox concealer and did not experience any pilling. I find you can also put supergoop unseen sunscreen on top of it and it won't pill at all, so I think this moisturizer just doesn't have much silicone/dimethicone if any. Overall, this is probably the best moisturizer I've tried so far, which is unfortunate because she is expensive expensive (imo). That said, a little does go a long way, so if you do invest in this cream, you shouldn't need to rebuy every month; maybe every six months at most."

I bought more for me and plan to buy some for my mom and sister-in-law for Christmas."

This is exactly what happens with this moisturizer: I look greasy and oily, but have more dry than oily skin. I feel like I have to rub it in a few times after I applied, like a bad body lotion. I was afraid it would break me out with how heavy it feels, but it hasn't. Those with oily skin, I would stay away."

I got this cream for my birthday gift in the trial size, I have been using it for about two weeks so far and I am sooo in LOVE! I want to try all the Tatcha products now!!!!!! My husband and I also both love everything with Japanese ingredients in them, and Japanese culture so that's a plus. Even though the products are pricey I really believe they are worth it and I got the go ahead from my husband to purchase every product in the line! It will be a lot of money and I'm worried about the price but this cream has made my face so soft and silky!! I have dry skin lately and its been a lifesaver!!!!! and such a time saver!!!"

I LOVED the glowy finish on this moisturizer but noticed after a couple of days that my skin was getting really dry while using this product. I tried coupling this moisturizer with a heavier serum/face oil, but no luck. After a week of use, I had a couple of flaky, dry spots on my face and had to relinquish this to neck and hand moisturizer. If you have less dry skin, I could see this as being a great option. Cruelty free status is a bonus but the combination of cost, plastic packaging, and no u201csticking poweru201d to this moisturizer means that it wonu2019t join my permanent line up."

I HAD to apply this product twice, & I don't really see how this is for dry skin as it wasn't all that moisturizing. I have normal skin with combo T Zone & my T zone was drier than usual.. I also have sensitive skin and I had NO problems using this cream. I would give it a try if your on the fence but wouldn't add to my routine."

Once I got the full size it felt a little thinner than what the sample size felt like (creamy) , and when I put it on after washing my face with the rice wash face cleanser or my clinique acne wash, it made my skin feel itchy and not as hydrated as it should be, along with it felt irritated and within a few hours my skin was incredibly oily. My skin also seems to dry out overnight when i wake up in the morning after using it. Will be returning. I wish it worked out better. Ill be sticking to my shiseido benifiance cream"

I tried two drug store brands and didnu2019t like the results. I upped my price range and found a product that I still use as a back up but it wasnu2019t my u2018itu2019.  I decided to visit Sephora and was overwhelmed by all of the skincare products. I honestly chose Tacha because of the display. It looked luxurious and classy. There were two formulas that i was interested in but the Dewy cream costs less.  I donu2019t use any specific facial wash or serums. My simple face routine is the Tacha Dewy cream along with Olehenriksen banana eye cream. These products have completely turned my skin around. I get compliments on my skin all the time. Iu2019m even accused of wearing foundation on the days Iu2019m not wearing any.  NOW, when you first put the cream on, it looks greasy aka u2018dewyu2019. But donu2019t fret. It melts into the skin leaving a soft healthy hydrated glow. A little goes a long way.  I was too excited when I found out it was this year's birthday gift. The sample consistency is not the same as the jar you purchase but i have gotten the same exact results. The full size cream has a thinner velvety consistency. The sample size was more of a balm texture.  I feel like i found my u2018itu2019 product. I have no desire to try anything new."

At it's price point I was expecting a lot more, but I honestly don't see much of a positive difference. *I have pretty normal skin that can get dry patches if my eczema is flaring up or if it's cold outside but I also lean combo in the summer.* I tried to use only the dewy skin cream twice a day (with cleansing and toning) but I found it was too drying to use at night so I opted to use it during the day with a heavier cream at night because it was causing my skin to peel around my nose and forehead, as well as cause more dryness overall. I only got one or two pimples while using this, but that may have been for hormonal reasons. The most effective way to apply this (for me) was by cleansing and toning, then waiting a few minutes and wetting my hands with water to apply about a dime sized amount to my face by pressing it in. That was the only way I could actually get this to sink in, probably from the HA in it. I really can't justify the price point but I feel this product may be much better for people with very oily/combo skin, and there is a light citrusy fragrance but nothing overpowering so if you're sensitive to fragrance it's not too heavy especially if you like citrus scents like me (lol). Overall, not my cup of tea."

But when I looked into it, the complaints were from women who had acne issues. This is NOT a good moisturizer for acne prone skin.  However, it is AMAZING FOR DRY SKIN.  I have always been complimented for my beautiful skin, but that's because I have always taken care of it. For years I used Chanel and LaMer products. At about age 45, I started using Clarins Double Serum (which I *still* swear by).  After trying a sample of Tatcha's The Dewy Skin Cream, I realized that it worked just as well, but cost a fraction of what Chanel's Le Lift or La Mer's Creme de la Mer. I switched and haven't looked back. I'm nearly 60 and I still have people compliment me on my beautiful skin and who are shocked when they hear my age. I have a simple routine: removing my eye makeup with Lancome's Bi-facil, rinsing my face with water and a washcloth (and occasionally using micellar water), drying it and adding a small dollop of Clarin's Double Serum, and in winter, following with this Tatcha moisturizer.   My skin is reactive, tending to Rosaceae. I am very pale (Irish descent) and burn easily (followed by freckles). I also tend to have dry skin."

I first got the $25 travel set as a trial pack, and WOW did it have more product in it than I thought it would. The two tiny containers lasted me 3 weeks. More than enough time to see how my skin would handle the new skincare routine. I wash and moisturize my face twice a day and Iu2019ve seen a tremendous improvement to my skin. I would have bright red breakouts on my chin, all over my jaw, cheeks, in between my eyebrows, my forehead and hairline. I have had a pimple maybe once in the past few weeks now? I do have scarring and some discoloration from years of picking at my poor skinu2014so I will be looking for a spot treatment for any pop-up zits and dark spots, BUT! I love this stuff. A little goes a long way and itu2019ll last you forever. The moisturizer smells good, has a nice feeling, dries quickly and has your skin feelings so incredibly soft. I was worried since this is a u201cdewyu201d moisturizer but Iu2019m less oily after using this moisturizer than if I used an oil-free or gel based one as I have in the past. Nourishing and moisturizing without leaving your skin feeling oily or greasy. Iu2019m just so happy I finally found something that worked! Totally worth the money, I buy this stuff maybe once every 2 or 3 months? Yes, it will last you that long. I just wanted to share in case someone also struggling with combo-oily, acne-prone skin was feeling iffy based on the reviews. Try the travel size! Your skin deserves it. <3"

My skin has changed in the past five years from oily combination screen to dry rosacea break outs and some fine lines. I tried the cleanser from this line with the combination of this moisturizer but found the cleanser stripped moisturizer from my skin so for me it was not a good combination.  My skin was just ok but didnu2019t feel great and felt dry.   I really loved this moisturizer though and knew there must be a cleanser  that is milder but yet soothing for my acne rosacea skin that would be complimentary with this moisturizer.  I lucked out as after experimenting using  CeraVe SA cleanser and the Tatcha Dewy Skin Cream moisturizer found it was a winning combination. Must be the ceramides & salicylic acid in the cleanser that keeps the skin blemish free. The Tatcha moisturizer works beautifully after I cleanse my skin as it gives the bonus moisturizing plumping properties. My husband complimented my skin and and that made me feel so good that it is noticeable.  Iu2019m happy as my skin feels healthy and youthful again."

I've also tried Clinique dramatically hydrating jelly and cerave which seems to help somewhat. With this cream being my last resort, I've tried it and it just soaked into my skin and my skin felt incredibility hydrating. It has been months since my skin felt completely hydrated. It does leave a super dewy look. A little really does go a long way. I feel like too much can contribute to pore clogging which I haven't experienced.  It looks well under my skin tint moisturizer but 1st allow this to settled into your skin before make up application. The reason why I removed a star is because I am not a fan of jar packing (although the packing is absolutely stunning), I do not like the the last 5 irritating ingredients at the bottom of list (listed on the packaging and tatcha website) which are: alcohol, fragrance, citral, limonene, and linalool. Although these ingredients do not irritated my skin personally, but overtime with repeated usage, I do not know what kind of affects this will have on my skin.  The fragrance is light and has a spa like smell. It is not overpowering and it do not linger. However the facial wash is quite strong. I've purchased this full size and will continue to use until otherwise my skin dislikes it."

This is probably one of the most hydrating things I've used on my face, but it's not hugely irritating and fairly creamy (not heavy) for the amount of hydration it gives you.   I have very sensitive skin and this brand doesn't bother my skin.   The two products that seem to be the winners for my skin are this and Sulwhasoo's anti-aging First Care Serum.   I use the Tatcha oil Cleanser to take off my makeup, the Sulwhasoo serum after, and then this as my moisturizer.   The first picture is 6 hours after I put on my makeup with this moisturizer underneath and I used the Dewy Mist just for fun- I am not sure I even needed to use the Mist. The second picture is with my makeup off and after going thru my cleansing routine.   If you think these are good results and you're around my age, I'd try this.   P.S.   If you double cleanse and have sensitive skin like I do, be mindful. The oil cleanser is great, but I have noticed that double cleansing can be highly irritating- just my opinion with my own skin sensitivity and likely the age of my skin. If I just use the routine I listed above? Perfect."

It felt like it was clogging my pores. I do have combination skin, most the time it is on the dryer side. After one day use, I broke out terribly, and the last time I had even one pimple was a least 3 years ago. I definitely like the water cream by tatcha more and I pair that with the dewy serum and it has the same effect without all the grease. Will be returning :("

Been using this just at night for about 6 months and have noticed significant improvement in my skin.  It's smoother, more glow and radiance, and plumping up.  I can wear a bare face now and look like I have perfect skin.  Don't be discouraged by the reviews about acne.  Acne is caused by estrogenic drinks like coffee and grains which mess with your hormones, not skincare!!  clean up your diet for beautiful skin and keep it that way with tatcha"

CONS +INCREDIBLE ARTIFICIAL SMELL. It's so overwhelming, and can be a bit irritating to the face and nose! +O.K moisturizing. You can find so much better results. +Insanely Overpriced!   If you want to pay for an overpriced product and get mediocre results, then this is for you.  ALTERNATIVE: Try the SERENE lac 10 moisturizer for night time. You'll wake up feeling like a different person, I kid you not. skin feels gooey and elasticky, feels amazing. similar price point for more product and MUCH better / noticeable results from the FIRST try. it's a professional product so Im not sure if it's available for everyone but if you can get your hands on it, dont hesitate. note: You cannot go into the sun with it on your face. it's really for night time / morning and wash off before being exposed to the sun.   I have sensitive skin / rosacea."

I've been attracted to serums and lighter creams (my go-to was Philosophy anti-wrinkle miracle worker). I was apprehensive about this product because it is thicker and I tend to have oily skin, especially in my T zone. I have been using this nearly every day since early Feb (still lots left in my trial jar) and my skin has never looked and felt better. It is positively glowing! I have not had any breakouts like thick I have in the past with thick lotions, and didn't have any skin issues during my monthly cycle which can sometimes result in a small breakout. I tend to have rosy cheeks and don't like going out without at least foundation on to even out my skin tone. After using this for over a month, I don't even need foundation! This is the only change I have made in my skincare routine. It is dewy and leaves a glow. It does leave a shine, but it doesn't feel greasy to me."

Oily skin? controlled. Acne? not irritated. The only downfall is the price, but I will def purchase a full size one if it meant I had the perfect moisturizer for me."

I also end up adding a drop of facial oil to my moisturizer before applying. Honestly since using this moisturizer my skin has gotten worse , more acne than I've had in years, Nothing else in my skincare routine has changed. Maybe this moisturizer would be good for me once i n a while but not a go to, so i wouldn't recommend it. many people like it, so it's not to say this isn't a good one. like i said, i liked the sample. but my skin then was clear and good overall."

It applies very smoothly and feels like silk. It is a heavier cream that takes a while to absorb, but it doesn't feel that heavy on the face. I was really shocked to see how thick it is, but it feels so silky like thick whipped cream. It adds a really nice glow to my face too.

I recommended the other one to my brother which also improved his oily skin. It easily absorbs into the skin and doesn't make it feel too heavy. sometimes I get small cuts in my face due to dryness and the moisturizer does not cause burning. However it can be irritating for me sometimes, it's mostly due to the scent. After my skin calms down from a reaction though, it's completely fine again. It definitely was the least negative reactive moisturizer I've used.  Purchased the 75 ml size this year in April and still have enough for the rest of this year. I'm sure the 50ml is perfect amount to use for almost an entire year (although it probably depends on how much you need and cover your face)"

Seriously, made all the difference in how my skin looked with makeup! I was getting so frustrated not being able to find the right moisturizer for my dry skin. I highly recommend this moisturizer if you find your skin is looking really dull and dry under makeup. It also gives a really nice plumping effect, but unfortunately that's only temporary. This is my first time purchasing from Tatcha and I will definitely be buying more products from them moving forward. It is pricey, but you seriously get what you pay for."

For people who have reactive dry skin, try a product with toleriane or toleridine in it : Laroche-Posay or Bioderma. You can use it daily, alterne it with the dewy cream. Tatcha alone reduces the pain, the pulling sensation and irritation that my face has by it's own, but I do use both and see a major difference.   A little bit goes A LONG WAY.

However, as I finished up the jar, I didn't feel like it did anything special for my skin. It didn't cause it to break out but for the price of the full size jar, I would have liked for it to have helped clear my skin up, or make it look more glowy, or SOMETHING. It didn't. I will be keep hunting for my HG moisturizer. I will say it is thick so if you're someone looking for a basic but nice and thick moisturizer, this would be the product for you. I give it three stars because it did feel nice going on but because I wouldn't say it plumps or really hydrates (it just moisturizes), it doesn't warrant anything more."

I wouldn't recommend this to anyone with dry skin since it won't make a big enough difference to the skin's health for the price.

After, I experienced issues that made me miss my pre-cancer skin.  Radiation brought on serious dryness issues and sensitivity and GVHD breakouts took away any hope of stability between the dryness bouts. I have been dedicated to using only Arbonne products for years, but suddenly, nothing was helping. I was going through cycles of horrible painful and itchy cystic breakouts, immediately followed by a mass peeling event. This lasted for the more than two years after transplant. After changing which Arbonne line I was using multiple times, to no avail, I decided it might be an intolerance to a common ingredient as it happened with all products, not just one.  I bought this magic cream based on the reviews alone, and I'm never buying another.  Within 24 hours the peeling had stopped and hasn't returned.  I haven't had a single GVHD breakout.  I go bare-skinned during the day now with confidence, when I NEVER left the house without at least a CC cream in the past - including before cancer.  This cream will always be in my routine now."

Iu2019ve used this every night for two months and I probably have another month left however I noticed the texture of the cream looks different than when I first got it. It looks more watery and less whipped in the jar now but still applies and wears the same.. it probably changed texture because itu2019s exposed to air every time I open it which is why I prefer a tube or airless pump. For the price Iu2019m not thrilled, I will stick to other moisturizers that donu2019t have perfume because it made my face more red as well.

The moisture lasts ALL DAY and ALL NIGHT long. You can wear it under makeup and on its own.

My skin feels so soft, it is plumping up like crazy! My under eye hallows are almost completely gone and my smile lines have decreased insanely much. My entire complexion as a whole is just better and more youthful looking.  This is very thick and may not be suitable for oily people or acne prone skin, due to just how hydrating it is.

A little goes a long way & surprisingly it doesnu2019t have an overpowering smell that triggers my very sensitive scent allergies. Iu2019m in my 30u2019s now & have been using anti aging skincare since I was in my early teens - premature aging isnu2019t something Iu2019ve ever wanted. They say the skin gets drier & duller as we age (which is why I added this to my nighttime routine) & itu2019s been doing pretty well now for almost a year - in terms of keeping my skin moisturized. Dryness isnu2019t an issue for me, but dullness can be if I slack for a few days (covid lazy lul). Anyway, I highly recommend at least trying this out. The price tag is high, but I believe the shelf life is 12mo (?) so really itu2019s not expensive once a year if you think about it."

And thatu2019s using it twice a day. The size of a pearl like they suggest (okay, okay, maybe my u201cpearl sizeu201d is more like freshwater pearl sized).  So, if you buy it. And youu2019re disappointed because your skin flip flops between oily, dry, combo, and acne...but youu2019re drier than Death Valley in the middle of summer, it makes a nice lightweight moisturizer for everywhere else."

My skin feels soft and plump.  However, if I use too much, I will break out because my skin already has enough oil (anything of too much can be bad at times). So, I only need dime size and it works. Fortunately, this product will last me two months because of how little I need to use it on a daily bases.  In the past, I have used so many moisturizers from drug store to high end brands and they all had terrible effects on me. Some caused severe break outs, others made my skin itch and caused uneven texture (the little red bumps) or left an ugly residue on my face. Other times the smell of the products would give me headaches. I tried tons and all left me feeling miserable about my skin.  I keep coming back to this product. It's beautifully packaged. The texture of the creme is lovely. It blends well with other products such as face washes ( biossance, first aid beauty) and makeup. I will be looking into other Tatcha products.

Even during the winter months, when Iu2019d get SUPER DRY skin without using this moisturizer, this was still too heavy of a moisturizer. So much that I had to alternate every other day to a lighter one.   For me, regardless of how Iu2019d incorporate this moisturizer into my previous beauty routine, it really didnu2019t agree with my combination, hormonal cystic acne prone skin. I trialed an entire 1.7 oz and had daily cystic breakouts throughout the entire time I was trialing this.  Now, Iu2019m using CeraVe PM Moisturizer with Niacinamide to fade all my previously earned acne scars and control oil. For me, the CereVe PM works like a dream and Iu2019ve been using it for 3 weeks now with no breakouts!  Bottomline, everyone has their own unique skincare needs.

I have really dry skin so at first it didnu2019t bother me. BUT THEN I noticed depending on which sunscreen/primer combo I use after this moisturizer, it always pills !!!!! ALWAYS!  It was hard for me to find a  Combination of my products that works well with this. Considering the price (for even the small size!!), youu2019d expect having no issues at all with this. But nope. I do still use it at night sometimes on days when Iu2019m feeling extra dry but I have completely stopped using this as a daytime moisturizer because itu2019s just too heavy, doesnu2019t absorb well into my skin, and doesnu2019t always interact well with my other products.

My face rejected it, and to be quite honest there are other moisturizers out there that do a way better job at moisturizing than this. The fragrance was too overpowering to start, big no no for sensitive skin. Consistency was good but left a slight hot feeling to my face after applied. Other reasons for a low score, it didnu2019t sink in well enough and my face didnu2019t feel as hydrated compared to other moisturizers Iu2019ve used. My acne was also not a fan. I would say if you are looking for dewy completion go with using a hyaluronic acid under your fav moisturizer, let it sink in, then pump in some more hyaluronic acid  to your moisturizer, mix apply to face and then either spray the dewy spray or pat and press a light weight oil on your face."

Anything you apply over it will slide around or come off in patches because of this.  I ended up using it at night and was still unimpressed with the moisturizing properties.

It doesnu2019t feel like I have a thick cream on or anything like that. Just literal oil. Itu2019s strange. And it unfortunately didnu2019t seem to absorb even my dry areas.   If your skin is at all oily, anything other than super dry actually, I would probably give this a pass. Or buy the sample size like I did to try it out first."

I donu2019t do Botox Iu2019m not against it but itu2019s just not my thing. I have done chemical peels Which has been helpful but are quite expensive and require a lot of prep no working out not get a massage at least a week before and after. So using this product along with the oil in the cleansing oil I have to say itu2019s my new favorite thing. Of course I love the scent of hyacinth. Yes oil is a little pricey. Itu2019s on par with some of the high-end products. But with the 15% off and Iu2019m about to get 20% off I decided to splurge.I always was a believer in you get what you pay for and when you invest in your skin which is the largest organ if your body and you take care of it you will see the results.

I started with a sample size, liked how it felt and have since used 3 containers of this stuff. I love it. The texture is almost exactly the same as the CeraVe cream you can get almost anywhere, but this feels like it stays on your skin a lot longer. It has a very soft scent to it, I don't know if it's an added fragrance or just how the product smells, but it's nearly unnoticeable and personally I find it pleasant.  Pros; Very hydrating. You can layer just about anything under it and it won't pill up. It's thick and perfect to use before bed. My skin is very sensitive and this hasn't given me any issues. It's not sticky, and it doesn't really dry down in the sense that it feels like it keeps my skin hydrated until I wash my face in the morning again. Unlike the Indigo cream, it doesn't leave any sort of color cast despite the purple color of the lotion. I'm pretty fair so the Indigo cream makes me look blue, but this doesn't change my skin color at all.  Cons; It doesn't sit well under makeup for me. It pills a little bit if I put anything drying over it like powder or sunscreen, so I actually don't use this is the morning if I plan on using any sort of foundation (I don't use foundation often so this isn't a problem for me, but I felt it was worth mentioning. If I do plan on foundation, I actually use their water cream.) Another is the price point, I really recommend buying the little sample size to test out first to see if it's for you. A little goes a long way, their sample size lasted me about 5 days of using it day and night, but it's still about $25 if I remember it correctly. The packaging it also deceiving, and the container takes up a lot of space."

Normally I prefer this, as I have used cerave cream & other thick moisturizers in the past, but this product felt unbearably heavy on my skin. The scent was very noticeable too in my opinion, and I typically do not have a problem with fragrances in my skincare. Although I think it would work well for people who truly love a heavy feeling cream, I would stay away and opt for other moisturizers meant for dry skin."

At first i thought it was because of my sunscreen (that I have used with this in the past) so I tried without sunscreen and it still happened. I tried without a drop of oil (my skin is dehydrated so I find that helps) and it still happened. Maybe I got a bad batch or something, but I will likely not purchase this again since at that price, it should be perfect.

It makes your skin feel like it took a drink of water and makes it look...dewy! But in a natural hydrated way, no shimmer in this!  A little goes a long way and the little gold spoon helps get just the right amount. The packaging also makes me feel so bougie, its luxurious and feels like a treat every time I use it. (lol) I've tried many moisturizers but i always come back to tatcha!  If you have dry skin just treat yourself and try this! You will not be disappointed."

Mixing squalane and cosmetic oils into my moisturizer helped a bit, but didn't solve the problem. I use this rich moisturizer twice a day, and I am finally happy with how my face feels! This face cream is non-oily, yet so nourishing. I think I finally found the perfect cream for my dry, sensitive skin."

It has helped the dry skin on my cheeks & around my mouth (p.s. I am 25, I use it in combo with their enzymatic exfoliant and rice wash - I have good things to say about these products). Why I am rating 'The Dewy Skin Cream' lower is because I purchased it exactly a year to date, I have used it sparingly due to price and because I didn't need such a rich moisturizer in the humidity of summer 2020! I store the product in my bedroom away from sunlight, I seal it tightly each time but have noticed the product EVAPORATES. I have lost HALF the container in the time I have owned it and so over the past few months of this fall/winter I have tried to use it up. I started noticing around the 3-4 month mark that it was going quickly but I was most disappointed with it not being due to use. I still recommended this product  but TATCHA please fix the packaging so we can get all the content we purchase. If you purchase it you may need to use it quickly and if you used it generously daily, my estimation is it would last you around 6 months. Thanks for reading!"

Itu2019s important to listen to your own skin and my skin definitely liked this product. Itu2019s the only moisturizer that kept my skin soft and hydrated all day long. With other moisturizers, I would have to reapply during the day because my skin was dying of thirst. I donu2019t have that problem now because this product is great at keeping my skin happy.  Also, a little goes a long way! At first, my skin looked too shiny because I was accidentally applying too much. This was because that was exactly what I had to do with the other moisturizers. After I figured out what the right amount was, my skin looked great!   So why didnu2019t I give it 5 stars? Truth be told, I think this is wayyyy to expensive for a moisturizer. In fact, if I end up finding another moisturizer that makes my skin happy like this and is cheaper, I will definitely switch over. As good as this product is, I do think that $68 is a lot.   If the price works for you though, I still highly recommend it!"

A little goes quite a long way!   There is a light, fresh, almost milky like scent, that instantly disappeared.   I use lactic acids and retinoids daily and this product helped keep my skin soft and minimized dryness. The cream played well with my current skin care routine.   Did work well with daytime makeup, if you use the cream sparingly. Looks dewy and gorgeous on bare skin.   I have not used this cream as long as I have my normal products, so I cannot vouch for the long term benefits, but I will update. I have favorite night cream (which also has algae), but found this cream much more hydrating, if it performs as well as my other, it may knock it out of my line up, at least in the winter.   My husband has oily skin and large pores, but still likes this cream when applied at night. I thought it really plumped his skin. Probably not good for day time oily skin.   #Tatcha #DewySkin #Hydrating #Cream #Clean #CrueltyFree"

Iu2019m prone to red, painful, dry patches on my face. I used to put oil AND a moisturizer on in the morning, but by noon, my nose and forehead would look like a snake shedding its skin. Not a good look especially with makeup on.. I randomly added a sample of this moisturizer to my cart when purchasing a lipstick. I had super low expectations because Iu2019ve tried it all.. I was genuinely shocked when I put it on and immediately had to buy the biggest size. My skin has never been this moisturized for the entire day. Iu2019ve also never seen my skin be dewy. Ever. Only crusty and dusty. This moisturizer is a game changer. It has a very gentle scent, not overpowering and doesnu2019t irritate my sensitive skin. Itu2019s not oily and doesnu2019t make you look greasy. Start with a tiny bit and give it time to absorb before putting on makeup (comes with a spatula attached to the lid). I would probably not recommend it for oily or normal skin as I could see it being too heavy. But if your skin is parched and flaky, you will try it once and throw your money at this product for the rest of your life. I promise."

I don't find the fragrance pleasing and would prefer a cream that is unscented. (3) It leaves a residue on your face - hence marketed as a dewy skin cream. I prefer Biossance's Squalane & Omega Repair Cream also sold here on Sephora as a deep moisturizer (unscented) for a cream that is also dewy. The packaging is much less jazzy but I consider it to be the better cream of the two.  BOTTOM-LINE: Heavily fragranced purple cream in very pretty packaging, that leaves a reside (dewy). Competent cream but there are better IMO.  3.5 stars out of 5."

I was totally blown away by this moisturizer and bought a holiday set with a full size and two other products. My dry patches are instantly soothed when applied and my face feels amazing. It is a bit heavy for daily use but I love it when my skin needs a bit more. I also really enjoy using this as a night time moisturizer."

However, after about two weeks of regular use Iu2019ve realized that the issue of product pilling on my face Iu2019ve been noticing recently is 100% caused by this product. It isnu2019t incredibly moisturizing for me, and that seems to be because the product sits on the top of my skin and doesnu2019t sink in. I can wear it at night but I cannot wear it under makeup because it pills on application. I have been applying it after cleansing and a simple serum, with SPF over top. With other moisturizers Iu2019ve never had this issue, so it will not be a repurchase for me."

Coworkers asked me if I was unwell.  I actually had to find a deep cleanser (rather than my normal gentle/moisturizing one) to get it all off.  I used it consistently for 2 weeks hoping my skin would adjust....then came the breakouts.  Score - teenage skin all over again!

Under makeup and topped with primer it performs beautifully as well, no pilling when combined with other brands of skincare. Sure the price tag is high but if used properly it will last, remember more is not always better but a waste of product.

I tried the water cream and it wasn't hydrating enough. I have Combo skin with dry patches, and thought this would be a great staple for my winter routine. Unfortunately it just did not work. It's been over 3 hours since applying and it still hasn't sunk into my skin and has made it overly oily and tacky (I used a very small amount   - little goes a long way). This cream is meant for someone with very dry dry dry skin. I would not recommend this for normal, oily or combo skin, or for summer use. It smells lovely and love the purple. I think I will try the silk cream to see if that balances things out. If you have dry skin, I recommend this product."

I also suffer with adult acne, and this does not clog my pores, nor does it make me break out. I highly recommend this product, and I will continue buying more tatcha products in the future."

No irritation or breakouts, although the moisturizer might be a bit too heavy for someone with acne prone skin.

I do find it to be slightly over priced but like I said so far the moisturizer is living up to the other high rank reviews. Iu2019ll decide by the end of the jar if it will be a repurchase."

            "review_text": "This lovely texture and packaging belong to the one and only the Tatcha Dewy Skin Cream! I've been hearing people rave and rave about this product for quite a long time, and it definitely had my interest especially because I have a dry skin type and tend to love anything that claims to be dewy. However, when I investigated further and discovered that the price tag on this guy is $68 (for a pretty standard size of 1.7 oz!), I definitely started to second guess whether I really *needed* to give this product a try or not. I gave it some time and consideration, but found myself always coming back to it and constantly adding and removing it from my Sephora cart, so eventually I just decided to go ahead and finally splurge on this pricey moisturizer to find out what all the hype was about. And I must say I've been pleasantly surprised! I was a lil worried that the word 'dewy' was in the product's name solely for marketing purposes and that it wouldn't translate to being actually dewy-looking, especially on my dry skin. But I was mistaken! This moisturizer is luxuriously moisturizing and definitely does its name justice in the dewy department. And, luckily, the seemingly mediocre 1.7oz of product you get actually goes a long way because you truly only need to use a very, very small amount of this moisturizer to reap its benefits. I find myself using about half of the amount of product I'd typically use with most moisturizers when I use this particular product. Which leads me to my next topic, which would be whether or not I think the Tatcha Dewy Skin Cream is worth its high price: to that I say that, honestly, it depends! If you have a drier skin type, tend to love any product that claims to be 'dewy,' and can appreciate the bougie details like the luxe packaging and subtle but refined scent of Tatcha products, then I think it's definitely worth it to look deeper into the idea of purchasing this moisturizer to give a try for yourself! If not, then it might not be for you!"

I like using it at night as a good occlusive over skin care products but it also works well under more natural/matte fuller coverage foundations. You can really feel the silicone and the fragrance is definitely strong which is why I didnu2019t love it initially but neither have bothered my skin.

After a day of usage I suddenly started breaking out. At first I assumed it was stress. So I tested it out. I stopped using it, and realized that my pimples are clearing out. Few days later after that my skin improved a little, I tested the product out again. I made the biggest mistake!!!!! This brand damaged my skin. Now my skin is a disaster.

Pros: The packaging, down to the container and the box you open it with- is beautiful and shows thoughtfulness. A little bit goes a long way. I have dry sensitive skin, and this product did not break me out nearly as much as other new products that I try. Leaves the skin feeling baby soft- even in winter months.  Enjoyable subtle scent.  leaves behind a dewy, 6 hour glow.  Tightens skins. Works fantastic overnight and during the day. I feel pretty when I wear this.  Cons:  The stick feels cheap. The packaging should be biodegradable or returnable (it is reusable) because recycling is not good enough to make an environmental difference.  Does not work well for targeting areas, due to the dewiness of the cream, the difference between bare skin and product application is noticeable.  It is not weightless. I notice that it sits on my skin during the day- like a light filmy texture.   This is a luxury product through and through, my product lasted 6 months with consistent application. I don't find this product practical, however, it's a nice pick-me-up or gift if you're like me and sometimes uses objects to fill the void in your life."

Now by no means is this a free pass to skimp on sleep, but the fact that it is powerful enough to counteract the effects of my sleep deprivation is astonishing. Never before have I used a cream that made my skin show such visible improvement (with or without adequate sleep). All my friends have noticed the change since I started using it, and have shared their glowing (pun-intended) praise. If youu2019re looking for a dupe for this product to circumvent paying the hefty price, Iu2019m sorry, but you just wonu2019t find one. This stuff is the real deal and well worth the cost.

But after two weeks of use, I noticed I was getting a few pimples. I never break out anymore so I thought it was maybe a weird hormone thing. I also noticed I that my skin was getting very pink on my cheeks and nose and that after applying Iu2019d get itchy. This is the only new product Iu2019ve used so it must be causing it. Then I went back to the reviews and read the 1-2 star ones. I wish I had read them before buying. Reviews stated exactly what Iu2019m experiencing. I also learned it has dimethicone and myristyl mysristate as major ingredients. I never would have bought it knowing that. Both of these will cause irritation and breakouts. I falsely assumed because itu2019s a u201ccleanu201d product it wouldnu2019t have these.

The cream does make your skin look dewy and glow. However, the glow could be interpreted as your skin looking greasy especially around the T-Zone area. The product does makes your skin feel greasy as well and it does not fully absorb. If you put it on one day without wearing makeup, the next day if you put water on your face the cream is still on the top of your face. I 100% would not recommend this product."

I wish I didn't love it as much as I do because of the price, but as another reviewer noted, it is the epitome of  luxury self-care.  It effectively moisturizes both the oily and drier areas of my skin, applies and is absorbed like a dream, the light fragrance is pleasant, not overpowering, and doesn't irritate my sensitive skin.  I apply this at night, and also occasionally before make-up if my skin feels dry.  No issue applying make up on this.  Leaves skin with a naturally radiant finish!  I look forward to using this product daily!!!"

My skin also used to be acne prone but Iu2019ll maybe get 1 or 2 pimples every two months now. My skin was feeling particularly dry the day I used this. I love The Water Cream so I figured this could be a better option during the winter months. I used a very small amount and it felt like Iu2019d slathered my face in Vaseline. After only a few hours, I noticed 2 or 3 cystic zits pop up and it clogged my pores. Nothing else was different about my skincare routine that day aside from this. It just felt gross. Iu2019m glad that I tried this before spending my money on it."

            "review_text": "So I suffer from eczema and dry skin, specifically in the top right side of of my face. When I first tried this, I had already run out of my past holy grail moisturizer (due to the pandemic), so my skin was dry and cracking in some parts and I was relying on hydrocortisone. I have been using a hyaluronic acid serum underneath my moisturizer so I used that first and my skin soaked it up. I used tatcha right street and immediately my son loved it! I was super scared that where my skin was kinda cracked it would burn like crazy, and instead it felt like it calmed it down. My skin did feel dewy and plump, which it super hard to come by, because some moisturizers feel oily out watery, but this one feels thick and it goes on smooth. When I first opened it I was afraid of the fragrance and feared for my skin, but it honestly did not effect me in any way. I put Supergoopu2019s sunscreen unseen on top before going out in the morning and they mixed well! Even when I did sweat a bit (bc of Texas heat) I didnu2019t feel oily or sticky, my skin just felt normal and still very plump. Immediately from the start you could see a difference in my dry patch of eczema. You couldnu2019t see the flakyness (in fact it shedded off painlessly) and where I had small abrasions it did not burn at all!! Do I think you should get this if you have oily skin? Probably not, simply because you might not like there dewy feel on top of that. I have super sensitive skin that breaks out almost immediately after using something that my skin doesnu2019t like and so far I donu2019t see anything wrong. Stuff with a fragrance usually makes me break out, but after seeing all the hype about this product, it got me curious to try it. I will say that the product does kinda sit on your face for a while, which has never happened to me because my skin usually soaks it all up, but I feel like thatu2019s what itu2019s supposed to do in order to provide the right hydration. All in all, I LOVE this product!"

While I can't definitively identify the cream as the cause, I have experienced a mild breakout along the jaw and a looming, mid-face pimple (from someone who may get 2u20133 per year, at best). I planned to use this product in the morning to take advantage of its cosmetic effects (and preferring something more technical for sleep), but I have little desire wear it in any mix of heat or humidity, especially with sunscreen layered on. If used at night product, I'd suggest a generous time allowance for absorption before potentially touching face to pillow. I'll try mixing sparingly with my preferred creams to make the texture palatable and maintain some of the effect, but Dewy Skin Cream is off the repurchase list.

All in all, I give this 3 stars as a very average moisturizer."

            "review_text": "First, I am a 25 year old woman with combination skin. My face gets slightly oily in my T zone in the warmer months and then leans more towards dry in the cooler months.   TLDR: This cream did not work for my skin but my mother who has dull, dry skin loves it. She says it makes her skin feel nice and natural.   I received a travel size of this in a set, and it didn't really work for my skin. I currently also have the water cream, and my skin seems to like that much better. Compared to the water cream, this cream is much thicker and doesn't spread as well. The water cream spreads more like a light gel moisturizer, which I prefer, while this cream is heavy and doesn't quite absorb or spread easily. I put this on at night after cleansing with the purple gentle rice polish (which I do recommend the rice polishes btw) and it felt sticky on my skin. In the morning, my skin did feel moisturized but my face was shiny, as if it didn't really absorb. And to be honest, it feels really gross on my skin and makes me want to wash my face immediately. I will say this didn't break me out or irritate my skin though.   Before I realized I didn't like this cream, I had ordered a jar for my mom for mother's day. She is over 60 and describes her skin as dull, dry, and sensitive. Also, she is allergic to most fragrances and pretty much everything else on the planet. She loved this cream and said it was really moisturizing. Between this cream and the purple gentle rice polish, she says, a lot of that stuff (even good stuff) leaves my skin feeling unnatural  - sometimes tight and dry from cleansers and moisturizers tend to feel like they're definitely there. These products left my skin feeling nice and natural. So far, my mother has not experienced any irritation etc.   So with that, I will say this cream did not work for me but worked well for my mom. If you have dryer, sensitive skin, it's worth trying the travel size (I project the travel size will last 1+ months)."

I do feel it's a bit too thick for daytime (under makeup specifically) so I keep using the water cream in the morning and together they've been the perfect duo. I love how this one soaks into the skin & just keeps the moisture there all night, it's never oily.. just plump & hydrated.

I starting using a bit of one of my facial oils with it as the thick consistency stops it from gliding easily and it makes it all the more glowy. It sits nicely under makeup."

So long story short, I tried the water cream when it was all the rage, it worked ok at first, but the smell started to get to me (I was fine before but I started hating the scent for some reason) and I started breaking out when I was halfway through the jar. Iu2019ve used a fair amount of Tatcha products, love the rice polish and the cleansers. So few years later I decided to try Tatcha again and I bought a mini size of this cream. I used it in conjunction with a sample size of tatchas vitamin c serum.. my face was instantly transformed, I was starting to develop premature signs of aging and lines, Iu2019m close to 30 by the way. The lines were smoother out, my face felt much better and hydrated and sunspots were actually brightening up. Iu2019ll rave about the vitamin c serum in another review. Also forgot to mention Iu2019m also using this in conjunction with the Tatcha essence /SKII essence depending on which one I reach for. But no reactions to this cream, my skin loves it compared to the water cream. And I feel a lot more hydrated and happy with this one as well. Recently repurchased a full size since I can see myself using this longer term than I initially thought."

I have to say that this product is absolutely amazing for spoiling yourself. Something that turns me off of tatcha products is the heavy amount of fragrance, however I think itu2019s alright to splurge on this because it really is a relaxing and luxurious experience. The product feels amazing in the skin itu2019s thick and rich it smells like citrus.

Over the past month, I've been getting consistent results; however, when I apply my skin sometimes seems bumper, especially around my nose. It appears to clog my pores, and sometimes my face gets a bit heated and pink. When I wake up, though, my skin looks bright and healthy and my skin texture is more even. Not sure what is causing the reaction as it is brief and only happens upon initial application. Overall, would recommend, but maybe not to someone with sensitive or acne-prone skin as the consistency is a bit thick compared to moisturizers I've enjoyed in the past."

For a year I've been rotating this moisturizer with Kate Somerville's ExfoliKate Glow Moisturizer depending on what my skin feels like and if I had to choose between the two...so tough, but I ran out of this and am missing it (hence re-order jar #3). ExfoliKate's Glow absorbs quicker and is a little lighter. This is a little heavier/denser of a moisturizer BUT I LOVE IT. A little goes a long, long way hence you can be generous with it and let your neck drink it up, too. Still good to wear under MU, just give yourself a few minutes if you can pre MU application. If you have to rush and can't wait the few minutes (brush your teeth), not a big deal. My IT Cosmetics CC cream layers and wears really well on top of this. Also to note, I just got Tatcha's Water Cream using my rouge points not long ago and it's no comparison to this. Too light for my oily yet dry/thirsty skin. The Dewy Skin Cream hasn't clogged my pores (coming from someone who used to have cystic acne at one point) and it's just pure heaven. Packaging is beautiful. Smell is lovely, too. Enjoy!"

Cons: once it dries and I want to put make up on it just touch my face, it pills slightly. And since I need a decent amount of this cream to fully quench my very dry skin, it does pill a decent amount once I try to apply any makeup or even touch my face. For this reason u use this only at night and will continue to as this product is rare in the way it actually moisturizes my skin. Do not recommend for anyone with oily skin."

It feels sticky, and even when I used it as a night cream, I still woke up in the morning like that. Itu2019s almost as if it made my skin oilier overnight!  Even though it doesnu2019t work for me, I still love the look and feel of the cream - just not on me. The packaging is beautiful, and unboxing it feels magical. I wish SO MUCH that it worked for me, but sadly it just doesnu2019t. I will be exchanging it for the Water Cream...fingers crossed that it is better."

If you're hesitant about this because of the price, I recommend going into a local Sephora (if you have one) to get a trial size. For me, the price is absolutely worth it - although it only lasts me around 3 months. For the past couple of months I have been on the hunt trying to find a comparable creamd absolutely nothing changes my skin like this (I have tried drunk elephant, Josie Maran, Charlotte tilbury, philosophy, drugstore brands, etc...) If I could only have one skin care item it would be this. I will continue to buy this despite the price. If you're unsure - do it !!!

This cream is excellent for holding that moisturized (dewy) look.  I use the dewy cream underneath the tatcha pore refining SPF.  Sometimes I add a little highlight on top and go foundation less or I can throw on a little primer and add a few drops of foundation on top as well.  I love makeup, but use a dime size amount of foundation.  Not sure how this would work underneath a heavy application of makeup."

I spent thousands of dollars on big name, expensive creams in hopes that I would have celebrity skin while walking down the aisle such as La Mer, Dr. Barbara Sturm, etc. They all broke me out, every single one. I was angry. I finally threw in the towel and received a sample for this and the essence from Tatcha. WOW. I kid you not - Within 1 use not only has my skin had this incredible plump, hydrated appearance, but within a week I've noticed a dramatic difference in my skin. More youthfulness, glow, less acne and flare-ups, smaller pores. It looks like I had a hydrafacial for the past 2 weeks straight. When I ran out of the sample I've never been so quick to purchase something in my life. At first I was nervous to use because of the purple/synthetic appearance, but switching to other lotions makes my skin mad. This purple goodness is what my skin craves and needs. I feel so confident for my wedding day skin thanks to this amazing product!!!! I definitely recommend to any bridge looking for a slightly more affordable end of the luxury spectrum face cream. PS - I definitely recommend the essence with it as well."

The finish is definitely dewy and some may just want to use this as a night cream but I love the hydration so much Iu2019ll be using this day and night. I love that there is HA in this formula.  I do use a serum with HA underneath on my problem spots but itu2019s really unnecessary for normal skin. Stays hydrated all day and night. I wake up with soft skin for the most part except for my patchy eczema spots which is normal for me but once I apply this over my serum I have flake free skin for hours. Would recommend for winter use and definitely worth the money. I love the attached applicator/spatula. Hardly smells and no irritation."

I was prepared to become a fan of all things tatcha. but the truth is, after doing a ton of research, the price point cannot be justified and it's just overall an ok product but definitely not worth the money. there are tons of products out there to try so dont settle on this one. yes it felt great going on despite a slightly tacky residue it left behind but the moisturized feeling didn't last nearly as long as several other moisturizers I've tried, such as the Lotus night cream, for instance. or Kiehls ultra. also, I don't have sensitive skin but this caused my skin to fuss a bit- there was definitely an adjustment period that's for sure. the other major detractor for me was how heavy this felt and how greasy it made me look and feel for hours on end. yuck. definitely does NOT play nice under makeup. made everything slide around and also seemed to interact with some of my products causing further irritation and the need to adjust my routine to accommodate it. ugh. more trouble than it's worth in more ways than one. so your research on this product and the tatcha line in general to decide if its money you think will be well spent for you or not, dont just fall into the hype because this could very well be an expensive mistake."

Perhaps this product would help those with oily skin, but I doubt it. My skin seemed dryer than a desert just minutes after applying."

I used this for over a month hoping that my skin would get through the adjustment period and love it.  Unfortunately that just didn't happen for me.  Pros are that it is very rich and moisturizing.  Cons are the risk of breaking out for the acne prone/sensitive skin women out there, and the scent (too perfumy/floral for me).  BTW, I now use YTP moisturizers (Glow @ night and Adaptogen during day -- love!)."

My skin gets dry in the winter, and I introduced retinol, but since using the Tatcha Dewy Skin Cream, I have no dry feeling all day long. Scent, color, texture on application are amazing.   Con: This product does not play nice underneath others. At first, I though the problem was the Tatcha Pearl, which has an interesting texture and takes some work to blend correctly, but it is the Dewy Cream that is a problem. No matter what goes atop this cream, it pills. It is not a good base for foundation or even a sunscreen bb team. Even a spray sunscreen pills over this. I tried applying less, and giving it more time to soak in, but it kind of sits atop my skin too much.  I'm using it now as a night cream and for my neck and decollete. So, while it is still useful, it doesn't help with a dewy skin look if make-up is a part of your day."

I was actually PRAYING I wouldn't like this when I got a sample size to try, because after all it IS pricey. But sadly it IS worth the money... at least the mini size. I say that because I only plan on using this under makeup when I want to look my best. So I can justify spending the $20 on that (even though it's still pricey for how little you get). But I already have been using Tatcha's tinted eye cream for over a year, so I HAD to try this too and I'm glad I did! Also, I've tried their water cream and while it's not good for dry skin most of the year, it works really well under makeup on a super hot day!! So yeah, Tatcha is worth the hype."

I apply it at night because it doesn't absorb fully, but my skin looks so beautiful the next day. I get so many compliments now!"

These two products are heavy and sticky especially serum. I can only use it night time because it will make me oily shine if I used daytime. My sister in law in her 20s cannot even use it at night time which will make her oily shine next day. It doesnu2019t make me breakout nor allergy. I donu2019t feel the firm power claimed by serum.

It keeps my skin plump and moisturized all day long without causing breakouts. Over the past four months Iu2019ve noticed a significant difference in the visible health of my skin too. Less is more with this product for those of us with oily skin. I do have to dab at my T zone to remove shine throughout the day but thatu2019s personally no big deal for me as I wear minimal makeup. I also tried Tatchau2019s Water Cream moisturizer; itu2019s recommended for oily skin and I found that it does not moisturize as well as this one (I had to double the amount of product) but it greatly reduces shine.

It helped diminish a lot of my acne scars along with improving my overall complexion. These days I feel so much more confident in my bare skin thanks to a combination of tatcha skin care. I generally do not leave reviews, but as someone who has struggled with skin issues and knowing there are many people out there with the same condition I feel it is my duty to spread the word.

I love how thereu2019s a tiny spoon on the top of the lid to scoop out about a pea size amount. That whole amount covers my face and neck. I have combo skin that is very sensitive and acne prone and this cream does wonders for penetrating moisture into my skin without causing me any issues. Which is close to impossible to find for me. Iu2019ve tried SO many products that just never work. My sensitivity either reacts, causes my acne to flair up, or it just doesnu2019t moisturizer enough. The Tatcha Dewey skin cream will forever be my go to from now on!!! I use it every night after my acne regimen, and it leaves my skin still moisturizer and Dewey for the next day. If I could give this 10 stars, I would!"

I am in my 40u2019s w normal to dry skin and hoped this would help w Wisconsin winter skin. I know it was free but the rehabbing of my skin wasnu2019t and it just makes you wonder how many these companies test these products on bc my skin never breaks out.

Usually it takes a couple weeks before breaking out. I tried it again twice more (weeks apart) thinking maybe it wasn't this cream... both times large blemishes the very next day. It is very pretty in the jar, and even though I normally use Fresh Black Tea Corset Cream (which is very heavy) this felt way too thick and product pilled very badly when I touched my face hours after applying it.

You literally canu2019t wear make up on top of it because it will come off your face in little balls. Itu2019s so weird. Iu2019ve kept it just to wear at night a few times a week, but itu2019s incredibly expensive to only be able to use at night a few times a week. I ended up having to order the DE one again for the day time, and by the way the formula feels almost identical. If youu2019re deciding between the two, or even this one and another one, go with the alternative. Sadly this is just not worth it."

Anyways, thought itu2019d be amazing, but it did not play nice with my other products, all of which are clean/organic.  After a process of elimination, research, and reapplying my entire skincare regimen multiple times, I believe the pilling issue is due to the Dimethicone in the Dewy Creme, which is high up on the ingredients list and widely considered a not u201ccleanu201d ingredient. This does not absorb into skin, sits on top to give a smoothing effect.  Will never purchase."
