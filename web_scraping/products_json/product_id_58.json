I used to never wear foundation because I found it too harsh and would opt for a bb cream, but this is something I will use every time I wear makeup!

Most of my 30s have been punctuated by me trying new foundations for my changing skin, and failing miserably. This one, however, is the closest I have found to an amazing option -- it's not perfect, because it doesn't last as long as I'd like it to, and I have to be careful about how much I use because my skin has a much smaller margin of error now that I'm a little older (boo).  That said, I know if I put this on, it will look good. The shade range is great, I love that it doesn't have a smell, and it doesn't make my skin have a reaction. I still have yet to find the best way too apply it so it looks smooth, but that's a me problem. Yes, it is expensive, but if you have sensitive skin that is easily irritated or turns red/is otherwise reactive, I recommend this one. I also appreciate that they make the small mini sizes as it makes the product more accessible.   Generally speaking, this is the best option I've found in YEARS, but it's not QUITE 5-stars. If it lasted longer and looked a little smoother, then we'd be there. But, I do recommend it and have been very happy with it on my extremely finicky skin."

This basically looks like a very yellowish shade. I think I could be persuaded to keep this foundation if the color matched the description. It does make my skin feel a little taut. But essentially, no one can top Estee Lauder's Double Wear when it comes to a matte foundation. Estee also delivers cool tones like Fresco or Pebble As much as I want to try and have tried the latest and best products today, I tend to revert back to Estee for foundation because I simply cannot get the right shade and I really do hate yellow.

I learned of this foundation via a couple of foil packet samples. As soon as I applied the sample stuff I was like, What is this wizardry on my fingers and face? My skin turns almost 100% flawless for the first time in a long time! I was just messing around and 'playing' with some of my items had just received in a Sephora order that day. So, I hadn't really prepped my skin well or anything, so I thought to myself imagine if I had cleansed, exfoliated, and probably moisturized prior to application of the foundation??? So, I quickly got online and ordered a full-size and travel-size bottle for myself. Yes, it's expensive compared to the loads of other foundations out there, including other luxury lower priced options, but THIS is THE STUFF!!! I also then went to the Armani Beauty website and got another backup bottle during their sale for 25% off. That's how much i love this stuff and now I'm going to tell you why: • silky, liquid texture can be applied with fingers, sponge or brush with excellent results  • medium buildable coverage • leaves a natural, realistic skin-like finish • blends super easily  • a little bit of product goes a long way • large shade range  I hope this review helps someone in some way. I very highly recommend this foundation for all skin types. I also recommend getting a travel size bottle if you're not sure quite yet. Good luck!!"

I have textured skin (a few wrinkles, some small bumps), it’s a bit on the combo side mostly dry… I LOVE this. First off it’s a watery formula that sets pretty quickly the finish is more on the matte side but not drying to the skin. I usually don’t wear any primers, I prep my skin with 2-3 products and this did well with that. After hours it looks so pretty and soft. I thought it would accentuate my flaws but it didn’t. It’s buildable. I bought this online and have to say finding a color match was a bit confusing. The shades seem a little out of order, and some of the product photos labeled my shade a different shade. I’m a true neutral tone and light-light medium, I got the 4.5 but I could have gone with the 5 which is light neutral especially now that summers over, the cold sucks any color from my face. When it’s wet it’s a bit lighter than when it sets. So keep that in mind."

I have been trying to make this work for over a month and it just isn't it. First off the positive things, the texture is thin and watery and fills like nothing when you put it on. It also looks very nice when you have one single layer on for about an hour. Now onto the negative things, first off the smell. This stuff is HEAVILY fragranced and it doesn't die down on the smell as you wear it. It also does not give buildable coverage whatsoever. The more you put on the cakier it will look ESPECIALLY if you have any kind of lines for it to settle into. I never even thought I had fine lines or wrinkles until this foundation did me the disservice of crawling into EVERY blemish/imperfection on my skin. The other thing I HATE about this foundation is how it transfers EVERYWHERE. This stuff will not stay in place no matter what powder/setting spray combo I have tried. I just really hate almost everything about this and it has the AUDACITY to come in at a $70 pricetag??!! DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS GARBAGE"

I said I wanted something that I couldn’t feel on my face, that looks like skin, that is good for someone with a very oily tzone and that won’t transfer. I was a bit skeptical because it says it’s hydrating but I love it. The shade match is great and it literally looks like skin. I would say this is more of a light coverage foundation which is what I was looking for but if you like more coverage this probably isn’t for you as you’d need a lot of it to really build it up and I’m not sure that it could be more than a medium coverage foundation.

I would also only recommend this for oily skin since it clings to dry patches easily, would not recommend for anyone with dry/combo skin.

It is very light weight though and it does blend super easy. Overall I feel you could get more band for your buck with other skin tints."

After the first two hours the coverage faded and the transfer was ridiculous. After the end of my shift I could see all of my acne scars and it looked patchy and shiny. As someone with dry skin I never experienced  looking shiny/oily until I used this. I tried again a second day with the UD setting spray which helped but at the end of the day had the same problem.

I was so surprised to find that the shade matched my skin tone exactly!  I ended up buying it online and have since bought extras during the Armani Black Friday sale.

Oh how wrong I was and I could kick myself… It’s a medium coverage satin finish that looks beautiful both in person, in natural lighting, dreaded car mirror lighting, and in photographs. For me it does last a solid 10 hours and when I do get oilier towards the end it doesn’t separate or fade unevenly. I do set with hourglass powder in some areas, (nose, nasolabial folds and very center of the face where I tend to show wear the most) and set with urban decay all nighter extra glow and sometimes kyrolan setting spray if I really need it to be locked in for 12ish hours. The true test is my blush, contour and bronzer still hold strong by the end of the night. So if you’ve been holding off, don’t make my mistake because I’m on my third bottle and have no interest in trying another foundation. For reference, 3.8 is a perfect match for my natural skin tone and 6 matches very well to my fake tan bondi sands aero ultra dark foam."

I love It as it is and hope to god they never reformulante the foundation  it’s sincerely the holy grail of foundations. We try others but always come back!"

I wear this with the milk hydrogrip primer, armani concealer, armani luminous setting powder, and charlotte tilbury seetting spray and it pretty much lasts me all day.   I will say though about 6-7 hours in, I can start to FEEL the makeup on my face. Up until that point it doesnt feel like I have make up on, but around 3-4pm on a workday, I want to just wipe my face off.  Overall its a good product, I love how it looks on me.

I measure every foundation sample I've tried against it, and they all come up short.   *I do have one nitpicky complaint regarding the description of my shade, #2. When shade #1.5 was added to range a few years ago, Armani Beauty changed the description of shade #2 from fair, neutral, to fair, peach. Shade #1.5 is described as fair, neutral, however, it is deeper and far peachier than #2 (which BTW, per Armani Beauty, did NOT change in color). While shade #2 could be a touch lighter for me, it is by far the best match in a formula I love, and is truly a fair shade, with neutral undertones. FWIW, I have tried samples of the uber-pricey La Mer, and more reasonably priced Pat McGrath foundations. Their formulas are lovely, however, their lightest shades have pink undertones (pretty common), so they're a no-go for me.  incorrect descriptor aside, Luminous Silk is a wonderful foundation! I often get compliments, and I'm asked, what if any foundation I'm wearing (e.g. your skin looks so good, are you wearing foundation?). It plays nicely with my Tatcha skincare and sunscreen (Silken Sunscreen the original one in the tube), as well as with both silk primers and it holds up well on my combination-oily skin. I prefer a light coverage, so I apply it with a damp Beauty Blender, and will often buff it out after application with a brush. I add a few dots of concealer where extra coverage might be needed. LS is totally buildable for those who prefer fuller overall coverage, but I like to keep it on the lighter side  As for cost, it's not cheap, but it's worth it. And, if you can catch a Sephora or other retailer sale event/promotion, or buy directly from Armani Beauty during their sale events (often 30% or 40% off with code!), you can often get it for much less $."

Nope, I'm the demographic who is stuck in both the aging (lines, wrinkles, dullness) and hormonal (menopause, acne) AND the dryness and sensitivity that comes with skin care interventions targeted at our range.  I can no longer pull off 24-hour wear or matte foundations (unless the Crypt Keeper becomes a trend). Heavy perfumed makeup is an instant hard no. I have tried pretty much every sub-$65 foundation in all finishes, both high end and drugstore. And promptly returned them, given it away, or chucked it. I agree it's wasteful. It's also hard on your self-esteem.  I received a sample of an even more expensive foundation, and it wasn't quite right, but it was *almost* right. Which led me to thinking maybe this one *could* have a following for a reason other than its brand name. So, I broke down and tried it, and had fully expected to be disappointed.  I WAS SO WRONG.  This is, hands down, one of the most beautiful foundations ever made. It's not juicy dewy fake or heavy; you just look healthy and polished. The coverage is just enough, but it doesn't cover everything and I still need to camo any hormonal breakouts. The trade off is the rest of my skin looks fabulous.  For the most part, it doesn't settle into my lines and wrinkles. But, full disclosure, it will sometimes crease in my horizontal forehead line, yet it is super easy to tap/buff out. Ladies, look. At some point we're going to have to acknowledge that unless we have full-blown plastic surgery + Botox (which is fine if that's your choice), there is no magic solution. There is the best at what it does with tolerable trade offs. THIS IS THAT THING. Colour match is perfect.  It took a bit to find the right sunscreen/primer combo, but after that, smooth sailing. Try it and give it a fair go. It's truly stunning, and will last a good while, so it's got some added value for money!"

I use argan oil on my face before applying, which works well for me. I have also tried the Tatcha moisturizer as a base and thought it looked great. This foundation has gotten me several compliments from strangers and friends. It helps make my skin look soft and hydrated, and people would ask if I am actually wearing foundation!

I found my shade and it was perfect match, however, after even an hour or so, it oxidized.   After wearing it a few days, and trying a few different primers (the Armani one included), I've discovered this just isn't the foundation for me. It feels like it melts off my face within a few hours and all you see is shine. Because of this, it also wasn't a great buildable foundation. It didn't do much to cover up my mild breakouts and rosacea. I imagine it would be great if you're looking for light coverage and have dry to normal skin.   I'm giving it two stars because hopefully, in the summer, the light coverage and the shade it turns when it oxidizes might be a perfect fit."

I had been using It Cosmetics Your Skin but Better for several years. The shade 20.5 was a good match for my fair, cool/neutral skin. It wasn't heavy, applied easily and I am all for easy. However, lately my skin is really starting to show all those years without sunscreen, the 25 years of smoking before I quit 5 years ago, the laxity that comes with aging and...yay! deeper wrinkles. I just wasn't looking GOOD anymore. I started to panic a little. I started looking tired and washed out and felt ugly and old. I could see the freckles turning into age spots and melasma and I was making FREQUENT trips to Sephora looking for the right foundation to go with my new skincare regimen (and I have been using a sunscreen faithfully under my makeup ever since ELF came out with their moisturizing sunscreen). I was watching a lot of YouTube and reading reviews after reviews.  Somewhere along the way I started seeing a repeat for mature skin and the Armani Silk foundation.  I had already exchanged foundations so many times at Sephora; God love them for their patience.  So I went back yet again, and got a color match but they were out of stock with my color at all 3 nearby stores. So I ordered online and took another chance. I about DIED from joy when I took some selfies and compared them to the one from a couple of days ago. (Sorry, I could only upload 2 pics). This in my kitchen with overhead fluorescent can lights, at night! No primer, no filters, just moisturizer and beauty blender applied foundation. There is no smell that I could detect.  It feels like there is nothing on my skin. (No greasy looking transfer to my phone either). It took 2 pumps that come out about the size of a dime to do my full face. Yes - I can feel the money spend with that second pump, but the payoff is so worth it.  It builds nicely, and evenly without texture."

This foundation changed everything- of course the one w the price tag, but it is so beyond worth it. A dab goes so far and another dab will give you full coverage. It lasts all day and I mean all day (I work 12 hours shifts often)- no creases, apparent transferring, and my fine lines and pores have always been an issue. With one swipe my pores are filled in, skin smooth and radiant, and it doesnt even seem to need powder although I always use. I am so beyond happy to find this, if anyone struggles with combo skin and finding their shade and have given up, save up to give this a try!!!! I wish I had tried this sooner, hoping this helps. One thing I will say is I got the wrong shade- Im a very very pale neutral undertone, chantilly from nars is my perfect shade, and I got 1.5 but 2 seems to be more of a true neutral undertone.

My advice is to go UP 2 shades or 3 even from your normal shade range. The shades seem lighter compared to similar shade descriptions for other brands.

Because it's definitely on the border of matte and satin.  Wear: Poor performance overall. I am not a sweaty or oily person and it broke down and looked patchy and cakey after a few hours.

I pumped it on my fingers and immediately thought alright it’s too dark — I rubbed it in just with fingers and it disappeared but in the best way possible. Evening out my skin tone at once. I even got compliments at the office on Day 1 — and someone on teams asked if I was doing something different. I’m somewhere between fair and light so can never get color right — either too dark or too light but this worked for me."

It is a beautiful foundation but for the price it should wear longer. Another thing I loved was that it did not have a strong fragrance to it, I can’t stand when other foundations have a  floral fragrance to it because why? I don’t want my skin to break out even more. I don’t have perfect skin so this was perfect for an everyday medium coverage. People with flawless skin can get away with it being as full coverage. It has pros and cons but in the end I had to return."

I had just bought the Milk Hydrogrip primer and was having the worst time using it with every foundation I currently had, so I finally bought this one and realized I’d been missing out! the coverage is buildable, and it just looks really nice and like your skin, while also being able to attain good coverage. it is scented as well, just fyi, but the scent is really pleasant and faint once applied, imo."

However, it doesn’t hold up well beyond a few hours of wear, and it settled in my fine lines and emphasized my pores. Not at all what I would expect from such an expensive product.

I take amazing care of my skin at 30 years old and have minimal fine lines, but this foundation showed every pore, texture, you name it, it made it worst. Also on top of it all I got a massive breakout from this foundation. Sad its not the same as it once was."

The color match is spot on so that makes me want to love it… Unfortunately, it’s feeling a little heavy on my face as I’m wearing it throughout the day. I know it says oil free but I’m still feeling quite oily. I tested this out with the milk hydrogrip primer underneath and the dior powder-no-powder on top to set. I love that they have so many shades in the mini size, most brands only offer about 4-5 shades in a mini. Overall, not my favorite but not my least favorite! I would say coverage is medium-buildable."

In store it looked OK, but when I got home, all I saw in the mirror was every rough texture and line magnified. And this was AFTER an excellent primer had been applied before the foundation. Just to check my sanity, I looked at my skin after I washed it off later this evening. My skin looks MUCH better WITHOUT the foundation. So I guess the trade off is: you can even out discoloration BUT you will see exaggerated texture. I have a little discoloration, but covering that with this product makes my skin texture issues EVEN MORE prominent. So, if your goal is even color for a distant photo or something or if you want even color and have perfect/smooth texture, then this product might be for you. If you have ANY texture issues (dryness, flakes, large pores, wrinkles, fine lines, etc.) then forget this product and save your money. It only exaggerates bad texture. On a side note, I am very disappointed with several independent beauty product review sites that tout this product. Will be returning my unopened product."

Blended beautifully and was easy to obtain a light even layer. I have combo skin with some faint acne scarring and this gave skin-like medium coverage. Has a lovely satin/glow finish without being shiny or oily. Ended up doing some yard work where I got sweaty, wore a hat, and had a gaiter over the lower half of my face. Removed these after hours of work to find that my skin still looked fresh with no creasing, smudging, and with very little transfer to the gaiter touching my face.

I wanted it to work based on other positive reviews I have seen on this product so I tried different application/setting techniques and with each it failed to meet my expectations. I will say my expectations were high given the price point and reviews from others. A few hours into wear this product melts right off. There is a lot of transfer (onto mask) even with a setting spray. The finish did look skin-like, however, it looked more like a bad skin day (redness/uneven) than a flawless skin day for me. A foundation that actually gives me a flawless, blurred, even, skin-like, and long-lasting wear is the Urban Decay Stay Naked Foundation. I will be going back to that foundation. It gives the finish (at least for me) I think I was hoping for/expecting from this product with no irritation/breakouts and with a lower price tag."

The shade 3.5 was perfect. I tried it and wasn’t even sure where I applied it because it’s so similar to my skin tone. It’s the first time I don’t have to mix foundations in order to get the perfect shade. Also, I love it the texture. It really feels like skin. I have such high expectations for this."

I have always used Power Fabric foundation because it covers my redness and blemishes flawlessly.  However, my skin has cleared up so much in the last 6 months that I felt like I needed something lighter.  I have heard rave reviews about this foundation so I decided that since I already loved Armani power fabric so much I would give this a try.  Honestly it looks terrible on my skin.  I have tried multiple primers and setting powders to see if it would make a difference and it still looks awful on me.  My pores are very visible and look magnified with this.  I even tried a pore clearing mask and a pore minimizer because I wanted to love this, but it just doesn’t go with my skin :(   I’m not going to entirely give up on it just yet because I feel like there has to be something out there that will make it work, but until I find it I think I will stick with my power fabric."

It's best applied with a brush in very light layers (I use the It Cosmetics Heavenly Luxe Complexion Perfection brush). It really doesn't work well with a beauty blender, but when buffed into the skin it's absolutely gorgeous; it has the most beautiful, natural finish I've ever seen in a foundation. And the longevity is amazing, virtually no transfer to a mask. I have a nearly impossible skin tone to match - everything either looks too pink or too yellow on me. The shade 2 fair peach is PERFECT. If you have neutral skin that doesn't seem to match anything, try the peach undertone. My old go-to was the original formula of the Makeup Forever Ultra HD, but the new formulation has ruined it for me. This is even better and I hope it never gets discontinued. Totally worth the splurge."

I’d say this is a true medium coverage foundation, so if you are looking for a full coverage, I’d recommend Estée Lauder 24 hour foundation, that is a good one for full coverage. Anyhow, I love how this foundation feels on my skin, it really does feel like silk and I’m not even exaggerating, the name is perfect for it! I pair it with my tarte ultra creamy shape tape concealer and just tried pairing it with my new hourglass airbrush concealer this morning and I have to say both pair very well with this foundation! I think I’d like to try and get the Armani concealer next and see how that looks together since it’s recommended to use together. I feel so beautiful when I wear this foundation and I just cannot get over how well the shade matches my skin! When I do a full face make up look this weekend I will post another review with a picture so you guys can see this amazing-ness that I am speaking about… so stay tuned!"

That being said, I don’t have a lot to cover so I like that this foundation isn’t heavy but it absolutely doesn’t cover anything. It looks like it’s just sitting on top of your skin and starts to separate 30 minutes after application. Also, it sinks into lines I didn’t even know I had at 27 years old. Returned."

It feels like you have nothing on. Great color selection-the color for me was a perfect match. I’m usually olive skinned but I’m the palest I’ve ever been.  It is light to medium coverage. Light with one layer, medium with two. Definitely need concealer if you have any blemishes or discoloration. The bad- within a half hour it started to sink into lines I never knew I had (I’m 27) and some areas of the skin didn’t pick up the foundation very nicely so it looks patchy. I used a primer and a beauty blender and still. I think for how expensive this foundation is I was expecting a lot more out of it. Very sad"

This foundation was a bit different for me though. This looks like my skin but even in tone. It minimized my redness and lightened my dark spots and did NOT settle into my pores. The first time I wore it, I did not put powder on because I wanted to see how it'd wear throughout the day on its own. It stayed matte for many hours, and I didn't have any issues with shine on my nose, which is shocking because I have oily skin on my nose, chin, forehead, and cheeks directly under my eyes. It was like a soft matte; it glows like your skin. I highly recommend this foundation.

It holds well and for my skin it works better after cleansing and moisturizing, then leaving that to absorb, then applying. Otherwise it can look a bit greasy.

I bought it to be photographed in.The good things about this: it has a lovely finish; fresh and smooth, and the shade 6.0, Medium Olive, is a match for my difficult to match skin. It does look great in photos, but not necessarily better than my other foundations. I am extremely disappointed in the wear-time of Luminous Silk. I’m spoiled, because my go-to foundation for years has been Estée Lauder Double Wear (Tawny). But, frankly, I get better wear (and coverage) from Clinique Even Better Clinical Serum, and NARS Sheer Glow (the foundation most similar to Armani for me) lasts longer than Luminous Silk, and has a more radiant finish!  I feel like I’m missing something…this foundation is iconic…but, in my opinion, it’s way, way overpriced. I need to use concealer with this and it’s the first time in my life I’ve ever used concealer. I find the finish of Double Wear to be more beautiful on my skin. People compliment my skin all the time when I use it. In a month of using Armani the closest I’ve had to a compliment is someone told me I looked tired one day. Since this foundation is so lauded, I expected it to be something with exceptional performance and appearance.  On my skin it doesn’t hold a candle to Double Wear. For “radiant” foundation NARS Sheer Glow is more beautiful on me, and for “natural”, I prefer Clinique Even Better serum. For perfect skin, Double Wear can’t be beat. I had to try this, and I’m glad I did. I’m also glad I honestly prefer other foundations. This is overpriced, and something in it makes me break out when I use it daily."

I recently decided to go on a mission to find permanent makeup staples because I was sick of trying stuff and wasting money instead of having my go-to’s and sticking with that. I kept seeing great reviews for this so I watched a bunch of YouTube videos and read all the website reviews and I must say I am not disappointed at all. Not only is it the perfect shade (so rare) but it goes on so beautifully and lasts forever. I use the milk hydro grip spray and it makes it go even further. I’m a barista and a large part of my job are long shifts but also appearance (get them tips girl) and this stuff lasts through my 12 hour shifts AND when I check the mirror SURE I look gross after all that time, I still look great. It’s pricey but I can move some stuff around to make sure I keep this in my bag."

I did have a hard time finding my shade but once I found that I was good. About to buy my winter shade during the sale! I tried other foundations that match me better and found I don’t like anything as much as I like this. I wish it was cheaper but it’s my new holy grail."

When you hold the two bottles side by side you would expect the same undertone, just a lighter color but they are obviously different. The 6 shows a bit green and the 3.5 is orange compared to it.  I had to return it and switch to a Light Golden 4 which I will probably just mix with the 6."

I loved elf’s BB cream because it was enough to cover/blend dark spots and acne scars, but also let my real skin shine through a bit. I also like moisturized/dewy VS. Matte. Now that my favorite bb cream is never in stock, I asked for a rec from a friend and she suggested this one. Needless to say, it’s a big price jump. But I do really love this! Coverage is just what I want, I still spot conceal any stubborn acne but it covers any scars or pigmentation. It stays all day (ALL DAY), and blends without any lines or oxidation. You do need to moisturize well or use something dewy (glossier futuredew for me) to really get that glow, but it definitely isn’t harshe matte by itself. Picking a shade was tough Online because I’m not used to so many undertone options. I’m pretty fair, couldn’t decide my undertone, so I went to store for shade matching. Even though I could probably get away with a few different shades, matching in store with the matching technology confirmed the one I was leaning toward. And a little goes a LONG way with this foundation, so I think it will last a long time. I’ll be buying again!"

			"review_text": "This foundation creates a very beautiful natural finish no matter what I use for application: Fenty Precision Makeup Sponge, or fingers, doesn't matter. I prefer a very light coverage application, so I cannot say how this would hold up if I needed fuller coverage. It's just barely scented, and inoffensively. It sits well by itself or with a setting powder over it (I use MAC Blot). I tend towards oilier, so the powder helps it last a lot longer. Even without powder, it doesn't clog my pores, nor does it look like it's separating throughout the day (in fact it looks surprisingly glowy after some oil starts appearing by early afternoon). It does start moving and collecting around the nose once the oiliness sets in late day, but no foundation is impervious to that.  I would highly recommend this to anyone with normal, combination, or oily skin. I'm fairly on top of exfoliation, so I cannot say if this has ever clung to dry patches (though I find that no foundation holds up if you have dry skin, so I would be amazed if this was an exception).  Application goes on very smoothly. This is NOT a thick formula, nor does it run like a watery tint. It's more moist than MAC or NARS Foundations, in my experience, but not quite a hydrating lotion. It doesn't tend to dry before I'm finished applying, and I live in a very dry climate.  I have not worn this during a hot sweaty humid summer yet, so I cannot review for that climate. Currently it is a crisp and dry autumn, and it's holding up well throughout day and evening wear."

I have very dry skin due to the climate and was also told to avoid anything matte from settling into my pores, fine lines, and any scarring and and that this type of foundation would be better suited for my skin. I liked the finish and it made my skin look more even, however I felt like it made any scarring look more prominent due to the dewy sheen it left, I used Mineral Fusion powder sunscreen over it and that solved the issue to a degree. This also turned out to not be enough coverage for me since I have hyperpigmentation and found it rather sheer despite trying to build up the coverage by reapplying a few times and it did not have any staying power for me, so I ended up returning it. I’m sure this would look really amazing on good skin and/or skin with minor damage. So far the Clinique Even Better Makeup (not the newest serum one) is the only one I found that blurs imperfections and makes scarring less noticeable."

They are so beautiful and last all day. Sometimes I like to wear liquids, but I can never find the perfect match or one that doesn't break me out. I got a sample of this with Sephora's complexion sample offer, so I tried this one in 5.5. Before I got my correct shade, 5.5 appeared full coverage. I could pull it off, but once my acne scars clear up, it'll be fine using my match which is 5.1. It does state this being medium coverage, though, and I would agree. I was looking at the Power Fabric before I chose this one. Both have some mixed reviews, so I went with this one because I was able to try it first. Plus, this honestly looked a lot more on the matte side than luminous which I am super happy about. I have no doubt I'd love the Power Fabric, but The Neo Nude isn't that great as it doesn't last all day like this one. I can put this on in the early morning, no powder over it, and when I go to take my makeup off late at night, it still looks the same. I am very impressed. I have a semi-oily forehead in the summer, otherwise my skin is pretty normal. I've only applied this with my fingers, and I can't believe how perfect it looks. Also, you can't put too much on either! I wanted to test it, so I opened up another sample, and I kept layering and layering and it seriously remained the same. It was like magic, I had no idea where all the product was going haha, and I hate to think of that going into my skin.. This is foolproof: you can't put too little or too much, so you don't have to worry about it getting cakey. Highly recommend!"

			"review_text": "Pros: Absolutely beautiful finish that made my skin look glowy and radiant without looking sweaty. Amazing lasting power, stayed on all day without budging. Didn't settle into fine lines too much.  Cons: It's difficult to apply evenly, has a tendency to build up coverage very quickly, so you have to spend a lot of time blending it out to get it to look even. I would say it clings to dry patches slightly and emphasizes pores a little bit (not a lot, just slightly more than some foundations I've used). It definitely takes a lot of work to perfect the application of this foundation when compared to sheer/buildable formulas.   Another thing to note is that it's somewhat difficult to find your best match with this foundation since the shade numbering system isn't very intuitive (some shades are darker than shades with a higher number)"

Not sure when these changes took place, but I’ll definitely need to go in and get colour matched again. It’s a very forgiving foundation and even though this new shade name change is off from my previous one, I have been able to make it work this summer, more so than any of the other foundations I own. I also love that this product smells like summer in a bottle. It is pricey, but I’d rather have one foundation that does what I need it to, than a collection of them that do a semi-okay job.

Previously, I was using Nars sheer glow and I found it would give me really aggressive flash back in photos, it was far more oily - to the point that, my normally somewhat dry skin would be greasy and my makeup would always look gross by the end of the day. I’ve tried a decent number of other foundations (Dior face and body, Fenty pro filt’r hydrating foundation, Gucci Fluide De Beauté  - to name a few) and nothing, I mean literally NOTHING makes my skin look the way luminous silk does. If you’re someone with cooler undertones - this ones for you. I have olive, medium, cool tone skin... and what my quest for the perfect foundation has taught me, is that most companies, while they have a cool, neutral and warm option in most shades. The cool colours are still too orange or will oxidize by the end of the day, leaving you with a completely different color face (I can’t tell you how much I love leaving for work, only to realize halfway through the day that I’ve morphed into a jersey shore reject). Luminous silk is the only foundation that TRULY matches my skin. It blends seamlessly, you don’t require a lot of product to get a beautiful full face (for every day use, I’ll usually use about half a pump and if I’m going full glam, I’ll use 2), it’s super easy to build up if you want it to be more full coverage and the finish is juuuust gorgeous. I’ve never seen my skin look more radiant, even, glowing and still look like MY skin. If you’re at all thinking about purchasing this product - pull the trigger! Trust me, you will not regret it!"

It provides a youthful glow and doesn’t irritate or break my skin out. I absolutely love it!!!  It’s not full coverage, but covers well.  I can have oily spots and this doesn’t cause issues with that. I wish I could have all the money back I wasted on foundations over the years, but I am so happy I tried this.  On my third full-sized bottle and will never use anything else."

I had heard it takes a while to find the one you fall head over heels for ;), but gosh, I wasn't expecting this....  It's such a beautiful foundation. Feels super lightweight, and spreads so easily. It doesn't dry on the face super quick, and it has the most natural finish without compromising coverage. I don't have blemishes or textured skin, but I do struggle with an uneven tone, and this works wonders. It plays well with all my other products, and I appreciate that it fades slightly by the end of the day. It's resilient enough that it stays put during/after my daily gym visit, so I'm happy.   Obviously the price is a drawback, but I w/e, it got me out of my rut. Will definitely be repurchasing."

I’m sure it wouldn’t have worked for me back then, but i love it now!! (I was all about full coverage and matte foundations back then bc of my skin’s condition and oiliness, but now my skin has evened out a lot - still have freckles/melasma and skin has become more dry combo). This foundation is a true medium coverage, but lightly veils my freckles which I’m now ok with. Otherwise, it enhances my skin well. I use my sunscreen/tatcha silk liquid primer underneath and they work quite well together. This foundation definitely isn’t budge proof with mask on and an extra muggy hot day in TX, but otherwise it wears great and doesn’t become oily or slide off my face! Also really impressed with how great it looks in photos. Not sure how to describe it - skin looks smooth and has a healthy subtle glow. For more glow that’s still fairly natural, I layer my hourglass ambient lighting powder in ethereal over this. Started off with the wrong color #5, then went down to 4.5 which matched pretty close to my neck. Never feels cakey or looks heavy, just looks pretty close to skin for me. This and the dior forever glow are my favorites. Definitely will repurchase the Armani silk again!!"

First, the color is the best matching foundation I've ever used. Ever. That alone was worth the price tag.  At 53 I'm trying to find a more natural finish than my ELDW can provide, and this is it.  A little goes a long way here and yet the coverage is perfect for not looking overdone. I'm a solid medium to full coverage gal, yet this one gives me a bit more sheer that doesn't leave me unhappy. It covers what I need covered and doesn't show what I don't want showing.  The Cor match is so good I had to look in my 10x mirror to convince myself I had product on my face. First time user I matched by the description given here.  Light is too light, I'm not quite medium, and light medium neutral was my correct guess.  I used a damp blender and would wear this out to a fancy event without worry.  It's not a long wear foundation but gets me through my day.  I've had to realize that long wears just don't work well over 50. Because I bought the small one this isn't my daily driver, but I'm buying the full size because I love it that much.  It's similar to The Ordinary Serum Foundation, which I also love, but this color match is the selling point here for me.  Love it."

I read one reviewer compare it to a tinted moisturizer in coverage and I would say this is pretty accurate. Shade 3 is almost too light for me, and it oxidizes a bit. I wear Nars tinted moisturizer in Finland, and Estee Lauder Double Wear 1N1.

I don't have any major things to cover, but it didn't minimize even the minor thigs, like cheek redness. It sits on the surface of the skin - no matter brush application, beauty blender (best), or fingertips, you can still see it sitting on the skin. Plus, any dry patches or large pores it accentuates. The wear is not great either - after half a day, it has settled into lines, even using a primer. My GloSkin pressed base makes my skin look so much better & is not noticeable on the skin. For the price point and all the awards, relly shocked how much I dislike this foundation. Soo bummed. Was looking for a beautiful foundation, but I don't look forward to wearing this at all.

It lasts all day and doesn’t feel like I’m wearing a foundation. Super pretty super sad it’s so expensive. Will most likely repurchase"

Now that I'm 30, though, I don't wear any makeup at all at work (as I work in healthcare, and it's just really not worth it), so I've been having fun dolling myself up a little more on the weekends. I wanted to try foundation again but didn't want anything heavy, I just basically wanted it barely there. I read many critical reviews of this, and while I almost always base my purchases from reviews, here the reviews were complaining about it being too sheer, bare, and lacking coverage...and other, positive, reviews saying how beautiful it wears...so I was like, Aha! That's the one for me! And maybe I'm biased because I don't like liquid foundation, anyway, but I absolutely love this foundation. It is hands-down the best liquid foundation I have ever used. Please Armani never stop making this, because I will keep making it forever. Also, I am a very pale white redhead, and the shade posted for this review is the PERFECT shade for me. It looks just like my actual skin, only perfectly luminous and poreless. I apply it with a Foundation brush, and it's perfect. Highly, highly, highly recommend to my fellow foundation-haters. Other folks may find the formula too sheer and lacking, but it's an A+ in my book."

I applied with both a sponge and a brush. (I also applied to my neck and it came out super un-even) I didn't even make it till lunch time before this foundation had separated like crazy everywhere. I do not have oily skin in the slightest and use an amazing primer that holds up with several other foundations.

Definitely not mask proof either as it came off with my mask.

This is light coverage and I don’t recommend people with really dry skin to use this. Skin glows after applying this foundation and I’ve repurchased this twice. I only apply a thin layer and am not looking for high coverage. If you apply a really thick layer I find that it tends to get streaky and  makes you look like oily (then you try to use a Kleenex to blotch out the oil look and foundation comes off). In my opinion, I think this foundation is best used as a thin layer, then add your concealer and light powder + setting spray to set the foundation in place."

The coverage is very very light, not even close to its claims of a medium coverage. To build up the coverage you need to use quite a bit of product. It also is not meshing with skin too well (I tried it with both beauty blender and various foundation brushes and even fingers after moisturizing and priming) and it doesn't blur pores.  It does have a nice finish right after you apply it but it doesn't last through the day. Overall I felt underwhelmed as it is a pricey item and you would expect that it would at least cover better than a tinted moisturizer but it doesn't. I think for normal/ combination skin with imperfections like acne scarring or pigmentation the best way to use it is with a medium/full coverage liquid concealer and set it with powder to make it last through the day. Not a good stand alone foundation, probably best for normal skin with no imperfections."

I like to either blend with my finger tips or my BH Cosmetics No. 2 brush from the Nazanin Kavari set (fluffier foundation brush).

I can see why famous makeup artists love this foundation. It's light, it covers, it gives a satin matte glow, and concealer does the rest. I'd say that most people who are fans of this just need to even their skin tone. It's not a mask of coverage. If you have any texture, acne, etc. you might not love it. I can tell a good skin care routine is required! This is the my skin is looking pretty good, but I want to perfect it foundation."

If you’re into the no makeup look, but do want to cover your various bags, spots, and wrinkles, this is the foundation for you.  Well done Armani."

I then went and did 30 mins of HIIT cardio and WOW. The foundation stayed on and still looked amazing!!! I sweat A LOT so this was shocking.  3) it gives the most amazing natural glow.  The foundation looking great after my workout without my normal makeup prep is what got me with this one. I’m sure it’s going to look even more amazing with my makeup prep. I seriously recommend this. I know it’s on the pricier side but it is totally worth it. I have combo/oily skin so I know the struggles of looking greasy but I just didn’t get that with this.

I was so excited to finally try this infamously beloved product, which so many celebrities use, which so many make up artists swear by, and which has unilaterally wonderful reviews, but those hopes came crashing down with the first pump.   I tried three application techniques on a prepped and clean face.   1. This has a REPULSIVE chemical smell. I checked my makeup brushes to make sure it wasn’t them... nope, it’s a chemical, plasticy, nasty unhealthy smell that made me fear for putting it on my face.  2. The coverage was light but not really buildable. I like light coverage, but you can get $6 light coverage serum foundation from the Ordinary with better quality. Nothing was radiant or buildable about this compared to something like Lancôme Teint Idole or full-covering like Tarte’s Foundcealer.  3. The texture bothers me the most  .... I want to wash my face because it feels so nasty and sticky! 30 minutes later and it hasn’t set yet!! I’m afraid to put more makeup on top because it feels so grimy and I don’t want to clog my pores. It feels like bad heavy drugstore makeup. Without the coverage!.  4. It doesn’t apply well over acne scarring or uneven texture! It looks nice on the smooth skin... but I could get that from a less expensive foundation! 5.The only thing I don’t know is longevity. I will leave it on for a couple hours to see, but it feels so gross in the meantime.  If I wanted a basic foundation that did a basic job, this would work. It’s not the worst. But this is pathetically low quality for the price point, the hype, the tacky texture, DID I MENTION THE SMELL?? ... I expected something silky and radiant and delightful, and this is none of those. The hype of this is only branding...  go with the Ordinary or Lancôme or Tarte for a better price, and steer clear of this waste of money and resources!!!!"

As for my oily spots, a little bit of powder helps set the foundation in. Then I end it with a spray of rose water and it all evens out nicely. I am overall happy with this product. I gave it four stars instead of five because towards the afternoon I feel like I need to touch up. I can start to see my acne scars, and a uneven skin tone. Also the price is a bit painful."

I’ve heard amazing things about this foundation but was hesitant to try it given my past foundation experience.. I received a sample of this in another Sephora order and instantly fell in love. It’s expensive, yes, but worth it. I only use about a pump and it looks natural while still providing coverage. You can certainly add more to build up your coverage but I prefer a lighter foundation - almost like a tinted moisturizer. It’s super easy to blend out and have had no problem with it. I also have extremely sensitive skin and have had absolutely no problem. If my sensitive skin can handle it, it can handle anyone’s!! I once had an allergic reaction and hives from the perfume a store used on a shirt I bought there."

My face has an uneven tone and a few acne scars but isn’t that bad to where I need superior coverage. I prefer medium but buildable to full, if needed. This is extremely light foundation. I had to use so much just to get good coverage and even then it was barely medium coverage. There is no way that expensive foundation will last a month. I use foundation almost everyday and the amount I have to use, will deplete it fast. Once it dried, it was really nice and looked so natural. It is definitely a beautiful foundation and it matched really well to my skin tone. It was a little light but still blended pretty well. Definitely luminous to where it’s transferable. Even with setting powder, it transferred to my shirt. I always place my face on my shoulder just to see if it would transfer and it did. I returned it, not only because I don’t want it to transfer onto my SO shirt but also, it’s too expensive to keep buying if I have to use so much. FYI: I am fair, neutral warm color and 4 was pretty spot on. I applied with brush and blender. Both looked good but blender needed way more product to give me enough coverage. I prefer brush application. My face is dry and it didn’t bring out any dry patches. It was a nice dewy and luminous foundation."

I’ve put off buying this for so long and finally caved and did it and I’m so glad I did! It looks so beautiful, like skin but better. I have hyperpigmentation like I said and I find that one layer covers just fine. I did add a little more on my cheeks to see if you could build it and you can. I don’t find that it’s glowy by any means, more of a satin natural finish on myself at least. I’ve used so many foundations and never one that made my skin look this good. Seriously, buy this!!"

If you are looking for a matte look- this is not your foundation. But if you like a bit of glow- try the mini version or invest full size. It’s expensive - but the quality shows why.

My skin really does feel and look like beautiful glowy skin that’s all natural when I’m wearing this. I work long days & this product hasn’t given me any issues with flakiness or smearing/melting off like some of the other reviews mention. I do use Milk’s ‘Hydro Grip Primer’ underneath & mist my buffing brush with ‘All Nighter Setting Spray’ before applying, though, to make sure that doesn’t happen with any foundation I’d wear.

It's luminous without being shiny, and made my skin look natural and glowey.  It takes about 2 pumps of product to cover my face, so I bet this bottle will last a couple of months.  Oh! also: I have a huge problem with my laugh lines creasing with most foundations, this one did not have that problem at all.  I didn't see it settle into any fine lines.  It smells like baby powder, which is a plus for me.  The bad: I have peach fuzz on my face, and this is one of those foundations that, if not applied correctly, will enhance the visibility of that.  I have to work the foundation in a bit more, and that problem is mostly resolved.     Another issue is that my match from the Sephora Color Match thing wasn't great.  My other favorite foundation is in shade BR40, and the equivalent for this foundation is 5.1.  The real life color is lighter than the photograph, and is a bit too light and on the cool side for my skin tone, but nothing some bronzer can't fix."

As a makeup artist, I like a foundation that applies easily and blends quickly and this does just that. It blends into the skin so well and looks like skin. It feels light and never heavy or cakey. Even after doing several layers, I never find it to be cakey looking. The coverage is medium, but buildable to a more full-medium coverage but I don't think it can get to full coverage. Its easy to play around with how much coverage you want without over doing it. I can even get a very light coverage if used with a damp sponge. There's a light scent which is pleasant and not overpowering at all, I only smell it when first applied and then it fades quickly. I never had any problem with breakouts while using this and I'm very acne prone and have perioral dermatitis that is triggered by a lot of products. It makes my skin look smooth and airbrushed and I have very textured skin so that's saying a LOT. I also have VERY oily skin and with a powder and setting spray I can get 8-hours of wear out of this easily. It does tend to crease in my smile lines but everything does that on me and I chalk it up to my slightly oily sunscreen I use underneath this product. I always get compliments when I wear this, my skin looks smooth and silky and I just adore the way it blends with my skin, almost like a bb cream. Its perfect for all skin types, my sister uses it and has very dry skin and its moisturizing and doesn't cling to dry patches. Try this out, you will not be disappointed.

But I suffer from dry skin due to hormones, and I found it didn’t sit nicely, no matter how I applied it. Sometimes my skin was good for a day, and it looked great. Or while my skin was moist (god I hate that word) it made my foundation look flawless...till a few hours later. Unfortunety it also made me break out. During quarantine I changed up my routine and stopped wearing this makeup. Put it on again for the first time ever, and boom, acne a few hours later. My skin was clear this morning. So, if you don’t have dry and sensitive skin, this probably will make you look so so good. It does a decent job covering blemishes, and really does go on flawless...when you have good skin to begin with."

I’ve found that the Dior Forever Skin Glow is a much better medium coverage foundation for my skin and it’s $12 cheaper. It’s a good foundation and better than most that I’ve tried.

Btw I do not. When I take the Sephora tests for skin product recos I could check every box except acne. Finally at 40 that cleared. So there’s evidence some faint evidence of prior issues. My pores are big. I’ve got one on my nose so big it looks like I used to have a nose ring. Anyways...this is the most expensive by volume there’s a reason for it. It’s absolutely the best. Sometimes I have to layer in spots because it’s not really full coverage by I like the result. I have tried pretty much all the luxury and mid range brands. Nothing compares to this. I also wear NARS sometimes but it’s very heavy and has that mask like quality that works great for a FULL face look with heavy eye makeup but I don’t like it for every day.

It also doesn’t make me breakout, it’s breathable. The packaging isn’t messy either. I use half a pump on a normal day and a full pump for heavier make up — a little goes a long way. If you’ve found yourself going heavy on foundation, this one will make you go lighter because it just looks so nice — and you’ll learn to love your skin again. It can accomplish dewy but also matte with the right powder."

I wore 6.5 for years, although admittedly it was always a bit 'off'...a bit too dark maybe? A bit too...something lol. But I wore it anyway because I ADORE this formula and everything about the foundation. Then, I decided to purchase shade 5.75 thinking it would be a better match--no dice. Still too much pink in the undertone.   Last week, I was bored, *thank u isolation*, so i decided to purchase a new LS...I decided, after studying EVERY shade swatch image and video available on the internet, to try shade 6 *blindly*. Well, big mistake. It is far too green for my undertone to handle, and once applied, my skin looks literally grey. It's horrific.  NARS Radiant creamy concealer in 'Macadamia' is my perfect shade match. I rarely wear foundation, so i dont really have another reference. I'm not sure why I can't find a match in LS... Maybe I have to go directly to Armani, since their website offers waaaay more shade options than Sephora.   If anyone reads this, and cares to help me with a shade recommendation, I would love that so much."

This will not make your skin look like silk, or make it luminous.  For over 60 bucks, if you don't get the shade right with the undertone, it will wash you out, and than you will rather have to use it, throw it away, or hope you can return it.  It is definitely more on the matte side.  So if you don't like a matte look at all, don't purchase it.  I also thought it made me look ashy, and I have cool undertones to my skin. Again, for the hype, I think there are other products that are better for cheaper, or even ones that have a similar price point that make you not looked washed out and like death.  Very disappointed.  If you like a flatter, more matte look, than it may be worth a try.  Definitely get a sample and wear it before you spend over 60 bucks on it."

The foundation does oxidize though, which I believe all do. The foundation gives a beautiful healthy, vibrant finish. I'm a guy and I wear it every day and most people cannot tell that I'm wearing foundation and compliment my skin, but I guess how natural it applies would depend on how you choose to apply it and how much of it you apply.

So I use the smallest amount of tint to help in giving me a smoother finish like a primer for example but with a bit of tint.  In trying this particular foundation I love that it feels weightless and doesn’t look like I’m wearing foundation. It’s closest to a tint-like but with a little more coverage. Now I only apply minimal. Face looks Smooth, blush applies smoother and gives a dewy look to skin. I don’t think I would necessarily like it for summer though because my T zone can get a bit olily."

I absolutely love this foundation, I'll try my best to keep it concise:  -I have acne prone, combo skin, acne scarring ... hasn't triggered any breakouts -Wears super well with my go-to primer: Bobbi Brown Face Base, also works great with the Hourglass Mineral Veil primer -The color has NEVER betrayed me, my shade has NEVER oxidized. Make an effort to match your undertone, and it's soo worth it. -Looks great in the sun!!!! (the most scrutinizing lighting lol) -This foundation dries down to a natural satin-ey glow finish when you first apply it. As the day goes on (of course your natural oils are gonna peek through) BUT with this foundation, I go from satin to a forgiving Glossier model dew -Not full coverage, but she DOES work with you if you need more coverage. -Wear time: she holds up in the New Orleans heat just fine. I am fairly active at work and she behaves. Set her with some translucent powder on those long n hot days tho. -ACNE TIPS: Girl, same. The way that I apply it is: primer (wait for it to set), conceal the blemishes (wait for that to dry down for max coverage), and THEN do my first layer of foundation with a damp Beauty Blender. If blemishes are still peeking through, I grab a mini concealer brush and apply the foundation *only to those spots after letting it dry down a little. This way you get that non-cakey, good makeup day look and it all blends together <3"

I usually use a beauty blender to apply, but I've previously used a dense buffing brush (best option IMO), and even a brush really meant to be used for powders. Rating: 4.5/5   Coverage/texture: To preface, I have normal skin eering on dry side, I have hardly any breakouts and am in my mid-20's so I really don't need anything more than light coverage. For me, this is a full face but realize if you have skin issues, you may need more than this. However, it's definitely buildable, and looks great under any powders. I don't feel it creases all that much, but I need a setting powder under eyes with this. Rating: 4.5/5  Color/tone: They have a great shade range for people with similar skin tone as myself. I don't find it oxidizes or changes color throughout the day. Rating: 5/5  PRICE: I really like this foundation, but I bring it down to a 4 overall because it's expensive, and there are other foundations for far less cost that will do a comparable job. Nothing about this particular foundation really wows me enough to justify it for $65 before tax.  Like, it's good, it's fine, but would get a 5/5 at $45."

Use a damp beauty blender and apply all over the face, let it dry for 1-2 minutes then go in with a SECOND coat over the areas that you need more coverage (for me, my chin).

I also used benefit hydrating porefessional  as my primer It was an OK finish. I paired it with my huda beauty concealer... right away i noticed that it all started to look HEAVY.  I always set my makeup with powder and finish with setting spray.  By the end of the day this had settled into all my pores, and  my pores looked white and shiny .

At first, it feels like it doesn't have any coverage, but throughout the day I would look at myself and think my skin looked incredible. Not cakey, luminous, and just overall fresh and youthful. It seems to wear really nicely over longer periods of time, maybe a bit greasy for oily people. I think it photographs well. I would also like to say I have very sensitive and acne prone skin, and wearing this 2-3 days in a row did not clog my pores like some other foundations do (like Dior).   Now, I haven't found anything quite like it at a lower price point, but a part of me thinks this totally does not need to be 80$CAD and I'm certain there's another foundation out there that is similar (and if it's not, please makeup gods make one because I cannot love and keep purchasing this foundation)."

I’ve always been a full coverage girl and I’ve tried almost every big name foundation on the market, but I got so sick of how heavy even the most “lightweight” full coverage foundation looked on my face after a few hours. I tried lighter coverage foundations but all were designed for people with already awesome skin. I have moderate adult acne/oily/combination skin, so I wasn’t sure this product would work for me. Boy was I wrong!  First selling point: the color match is the MOST perfect I’ve ever had. The color itself plus the fact that it blends seamlessly into your skin makes it the perfect match.  Next selling point: it is so VERSATILE. You can wear a light coverage like a skin tint over your moisturizer, or build it up to a higher, customized coverage for a more full-faced look.  I will concede; the price is hefty for the fluid ounce size, but if you’re used to dishing out the usual $40-ish for other cult classic foundations on the market, I’d say this is definitely worth the extra $$."

I've always used setting powder, but I realized it made my skin look dry so I wanted to try a foundation that wouldn't require setting with powder. This fits the bill. It's matte enough so I can use it without a setting powder, yet still gives a nice glow and seems to reflect light as if I have a very light dusting of highlighter.  Its coverage is buildable but for the most part, it is 'light coverage' IMO. If you have flaws, they will show but that's ok and normal! As much as we like perfect skin, no skin is really perfect and the more you try to hide, the thicker and more unnatural your makeup gets. This foundation may not have thick coverage, but it more than makes up it by making skin look beautiful and natural."

I was excited to try my sample so when I got home I washed and exfoliated my face, put moisturizer on and primer. Then I used my foundation brush to apply it. I found the product to be on the dry side and it wasn’t going on evenly. It left blotches in certain parts of my face. I waited about a minute to see if it would even out once it settled and it didn’t. I’m disappointed because the color matched perfectly with my skin, but the texture wasn’t smooth and didn’t provide the silky skin coverage I was looking for. For those that want to try it out, go to the store first and ask for a sample size before splurging."

The first time I used this I used too faced major hangover rx primer, and my pores looked huge and overall the application just didn’t look good at all. Then I tried the elf poreless putty primer and while it applied much better by the end of the day the foundation had broken up and was all but came off of my cheeks. I set it how I usually do with Laura mercier translucent powder and morphe setting spray. I plan to keep working with it to see if I can figure out if it’s something I’m doing that’s making it look awful or if it’s just not for me. But as of right now I plan on returning it."

What I love most is that it is so light weight that I almost forget I am wearing makeup on my face at the end of the night (until I look in the mirror and see how flawless it looks). I do wish it had just a TAD more coverage, like my pro longwear did, and it is really pricey... but i just can't find anything else to replace my beloved pro longwear. In all, this one is beautiful, I just wish it was a little less pricey and had a tad more coverage but i'll just sub more concealer for now and hope MAC brings back my old fave. Will definitely keep using this in the meantime though."

I have tried every foundation Sheer,full coverage,powder,cream,liquid you name it and I’ve tried it..From the Tom Ford(love it though) to L’Oréal Pro Glo and nothing compares to this foundation. It is the perfect consistency to go from the look of perfect skin or to add another layer or two to achieve the most natural skin like full coverage you have ever seen. It is the only foundation that has ever stayed on my nose(I apply with my fingertips in super thin layers on my nose and around my lip and Cupid’s bow. It works best with a stippling brush and then a light go over with my beauty blender. It stays in place well when applying my cream products(although I prefer to under paint my face and let my cream products shine through) It gives you a perfect canvas to work with. Also I don’t use a heavy setting powder just the Charlotte Tilbury finishing powder works perfect. In fact sometimes I just use my UD all-nighter and I’m good to go. If you are struggling with the price just do it, you will save money in the end because it takes such a small amount. I ended a two year and an ungodly amount of money foundation hunt when almost by accident I found this beauty. I would recommend getting shade matched as they have a wide range of colors and undertones. I would have never picked something that said w/rosy undertones.  Go now to your nearest Sephora and grab the bottle that’s going to have you living your best makeup life..."

The color is an exact match, and it is the only foundation that doesn’t make my eyes water. I wasn’t a huge fan of makeup before this foundation because I could never find the right foundation so I’d just go natural, but after having discovered this, I experiment with different looks a lot more.

First, it's easy to apply an even layer. I use a beauty blender and two pumps. It looks great after I apply it, and coverage is medium and not cakey. I do have to pair it with concealer, though, for my problem areas. I use Hourglass Veil mineral primer before applying.  A few hours into wearing it (probably 4), however, it starts to look really splotchy and uneven. It begins to seep into my pores! It also moves extremely easily even after being set with Laura Mercier setting powder, and I have to be careful not to touch my skin with anything or I'll have a handful of makeup. Keep in my mind that my skin is pretty oily, so people with dry or combo skin might not have this issue at all.  It also has a fragrance, and it broke me out. I'm still recovering from this now!

I was using Urban Decay Weightless Naked Foundation for years before they discontinued it. Their new formula is awful. This started the dreaded search for a new foundation. I have literally tried almost all imaginable. They either made me break out, were too heavy, were too cakey looking, too matte, did not come in the right color choices, too thick, could feel them on my skin, looked like a face of makeup vs simply enhancing my own skin, etc. etc. I had honestly finally given into just using a tinted moisturizer calling it close enough but not really satisfied. I was in a Los Angeles Sephora with a friend waiting, and I walked  by this foundation. I knew it wouldn't work, either, but while waiting I started playing around with some of the colors. I found two that were close, and it felt relatively good on my skin, but I still just noted the colors and moved along my way. Especially after I had seen the price. For a couple of months, I thought about ordering it and giving it a try. I finally did, and I am so glad I did! It is perfect. It is light, but buildable, stays on all day over my primer, matches my skin perfectily, feels like nothing on my skin and does not break out my skin. I have blonde hair, green eyes, and fair skin. I get a lot of redness from having such sensitive skin. I feel this foundation does run a little on the light side. I ended up in a 5, and it is perfect. I highly recommend it. The price is not my favorite, but I am really in love with the foundation!"

I know a lot of the other 1 star reviews are from people who weren’t happy and did not work out for them and I understand. I was amongst that last year when I purchased this foundation only to return it. Reason being.. I didn’t buy the perfect shade match. I decided to give lumionous silk another shot with the help of a Sephora associate who was wearing the foundation at that very moment and we happened to have the same skin shade. She told me to try 3.5 and wow.. perfect match. I’ve never had so many compliments on my skin by random people. Keep it mind that this is not a full cover foundation. This is new medium to buildable. I don’t suggest this for ones who have textured skin and especially acne prone skin. This would of been almost perfect and I had to deduct one star reason being ... Fragrance! Fragrance in cosmetics can be very sensitizing or co-sensitizing. I believe a lot of the “broke me out “ reviews is from this very culprit in the foundation. The fragrance doesn’t affect me in a sense it will break me out but I notice sinus issues when I first apply it. Some fragrances in cosmetics induce an allergic rhinitis for me but luckily the scent wears our Throughout the day the day for me. I wish Armani can formulate this foundation with out FRAGRANCE! It would of been a true 5 stars !"

Despite being on the medium-tan side, my undertones are pink/peachy rather than olive/golden.  In saying that, most foundations are either far too light and wash me out, or too yellow and make my skin appear sallow.  When looking at the shades I saw 6.25: medium-tan with peachy undertones.  It matches PERFECTLY!!!  It also doesn’t have that “heavy” makeup feel that makes you want to wash your face."

Pros:  -doesn’t settle into my fine lines on my forehead -amazing buildable medium coverage -looks like skin -doesn’t emphasize texture -doesn’t separate around my nose -lasted 15 HOURS and the worst I needed was a piece of tissue to blot my nose (summer in Kansas turns my dry/normal skin to combo around my nose) still looked amazing.

It’s extremely lightweight but still somehow covers my super red face. Its kind of runny because it’s sooo light. I do have to build a few layers to get the kind of coverage I want for my discoloration. It does give a VERY natural look. My skin isn’t greasy or super dry , so right in the middle and it does not cause my skin to become dry or greasy even after a 10 hour day. Overall I like it but I don’t think it beats my $40 IT CC foundation. It doesn’t give me the shiny look that I’m going for when I say luminous. It does have lots of colors which I like because I can find my exact undertone and shade! I recommend trying a sample before you buy. It’s still a good foundation overall."

That, and it smelled like sunscreen. So I was skeptical. Still, I applied it carefully, with my fingers - a little goes a long way for medium coverage! Coverage can be built to full with dappling / stippling. But the impact hit me when I went outside and sat in my car: it was truly flawless coverage. It didn't even look like makeup - it looked like my skin! This stuff might actually be better than the Givenchy Teint Couture Everwear, and I really liked that stuff! I wore the shade 2, and it ran just the right amount of warm on me (usually I'm Fair Warm) that it matched perfectly. And since I don't actually wear foundation that often, I can get by with a mini of this. I will definitely consider purchasing a mini in 2 when the time comes."

The shades are all over the place and I found throughout my search for my perfect match that a few shades worked for me, which was interesting. So keep in mind that it does not follow the typical shade scale you see with other brands in my experience.  The product itself is divine!! Lightweight, but buildable for more coverage if needed. It evens out my rosacea areas and gives me that natural glow that I typically need to get from other products to use with my foundation.  As I like light coverage, a little goes a long way for me which helps me justify the high price tag along with it’s amazing finish.  Overall, Love the product...hate the price. But I justify it because of my low use due to lightweight coverage. Typically to get that luminous look you need a second or even third product to get those results so 1 product vs 2 or 3 offsets that cost. So in the end you get what you pay for which is an amazing product that I will buy again."

It stays put all day and looks fresh after hours of wear! My skin has a healthy glow that doesn’t look like a sheen of oil. It is fuller coverage without being heavy. I find it applies well both a beauty sponge and a brush. The shade range is very wide, and I recommend narrowing down your shades of interest online before testing in store to make things go smoother and be less overwhelming. One note: it’s important to avoid any moisturizing or heavy primer as it can cause it to break up. I find that some of my traditional primers don’t pair well with this particular foundation. It’s pricey, but to me, it’s worth the splurge."

I had to buy two different shades to and mix them to match my skin tone and it just wasn't worth it. Since then, I've gone back to my inexpensive L'Oreal True Match foundation and I love it even more. In my opinion, it does a much better job for a fraction of the price."

I was so excited to purchase this and indulge in such an expensive foundation. I finally got it and loved how smooth it went on my skin. Yes it is soft and yes it is luminous. After about an hour the foundation broke up around my nose, chin, and forehead. It is not in any way long lasting and looks only decent when used with a foundation brush. On top of it, I break out in those areas whenever I use it. If you are on a budget or unsure about this foundation I would not recommend this at all. There are so many other products that do the same thing and are guaranteed to last you throughout the day. I think it’s useless and not a good staple to have in ur routine. I gave it 3 stars for texture, packaging, and immediate look when applying. Do not be fooled by this though. I rarely write reviews but please read the lower ratings on products carefully and take them into consideration. :(!!"

Although this foundation didn't cause any additional breakouts, which is a rare feat, it did separate very badly and made my face look like an oily mess. After two hours of having this foundation on my face, my T-zone would look oily to the point where the US would want to invade it. I also noticed that patches of my skin would often break through the foundation and that the foundation moved easily, even though I rarely touch my face and regularly use a setting powder. For $64, the patchiness and oily mess this foundation gave me made it not worth the money. I could see how the foundation could look lovely on dry/normal skin, but it is not a good fit for ladies with combination/oily skin, as the oil easily breaks through the foundation and the foundation moves very easily. I've had much better experiences with foundations that were a fraction of the cost."

I use a good blurring primer and setting spray or powder which both help. I wouldn't recommend using a glow-effect primer with this, I found it made me look shiny. If you're looking for a less glowy foundation with similar wearability that won't break you out, MAKE Beauty has a wonderful foundation that's at a slightly lower price point that had been my go-to for years. I think this will be my new foundation for full-face makeup days. For background, I prefer a more natural look and focus more on skin-care than makeup so I spend a bit more and do a lot of research before trying new makeup items."

All other foundations I’ve tried up to this point either make me break out, are super drying, or both and I’ve had to return them. I have normal to dry skin and have some acne scarring, but nothing too dark or deep that’s too hard to cover up. My biggest issue with foundation is that I would get dry patches, but this foundation doesn’t do that at all to me. I’d say this foundation is more of a light to definitely buildable medium coverage. It’s like a second skin, I don’t find it to be heavy or really “feel” like I’m wearing a ton of make up. I don’t find that it slips off throughout the day, but I also don’t have oily skin so I’m not sure how that would work for those that do have oily skin. Shade 5 was a perfect color match for me, but I went in store and was shade matched, which is I would suggest doing especially for such an expensive foundation. If you’re hesitant in buying such an expensive foundation, I would go in store and get shade matched, and then buy the smaller size online (I don’t think they sell the smaller size in store, but I could be wrong). Or ask for a sample in your shade! Overall this has quickly become my favorite foundation and I would suggest everyone to give it a go! If you don’t end up liking it Sephora always accepts returns in a reasonable time frame and usage of a product, a policy which I have unfortunately had to take advantage of for multiple other foundations which I haven’t liked."

After some bad experience with ELDW I came back to my all time favourite G. Armani. I used to love their Lasting Silk foundation but now I’m a huge fan of the Luminous Silk. Such an easy application (I use Sephora brush #47, recommended by Sephora SA) and stays on all day. It’s not settling into fine lines or pores, it’s not cakey or too drying. You really get that beautiful luminosity and glow, without liking too shiny. I call it healthy glow. If you are looking for a matte foundation, this isn’t for you. Also if you are too oily, I would try something else. My summer shade is 5.25 and it matches my skin tone perfectly - not too pink, orange or yellow. And this foundation never breaks me out. I highly recommend it."

Don't get me wrong, it's a good foundation.... but does it make my face look like luminous silk? No way. I was applying with a sponge and actually bought a brush specifically for this because reviews kept saying a brush was better. It made no difference whatsoever, so there's more money I'll never see again!  I will say that when I put my ambient hourglass lighting powder on top, the effect is wonderful. But the lighting powder looks almost as good on my bare skin as on this makeup, so for a regular work day I have quit applying foundation altogether.  I now have a ton of this left and only use it for a special night out.  For over-the-top prices I expect over-the-top results, and this just doesn't deliver."

I was a tinted moisturizer girl before this - but this foundation is so natural looking and feeling that I don’t see why I shouldn’t wear this one all the time. I live in a hot and humid climate where wearing a base of any kind is generally uncomfortable - but not with this one! I would go so far as to say that this is the greatest foundation of all time. I am so stoked on it. I had purchased my first color online which turned out to to be a little too light - so this morning I went into the Sephora in Waikiki to color match and exchange. And I just want to shout out to the lovely lady with glowing skin and luscious curly hair who helped me out while my 2 year old was crying. I loved the tip she gave me about using my fingers instead of a brush - that’s my favorite way to apply foundation anyways. I tried that in lieu of my high density flat kabuki brush and I feel the product “bonded” with my skin much better. Anyways - BUY THIS FOUNDATION YOU WONT REGRET IT. oh and the reason I discovered it in the first place is because I read that this is the foundation the MUA for Game of Thrones used on all the characters. It’s so natural and perfect. I am clearly in love with it."

If I want more coverage, I’ll use a foundation brush that is angled with a flat top head. I’ll glide it on and then stipple a bit on my T zone area for extra coverage. It looks naturally radiant and gives more coverage. On a day where my skin is looking really good and my skincare routine has been on point....I will use a sponge to apply. It gives a lighter coverage but evens everything out and my skin looks lit and natural. This foundation can be whatever you need depending on how you choose the application and that’s AMAZING!

They coverage is buidable which is both a good and bad thing. It’s very natural which many people may like, but if you want a medium coverage to cover pimples, imperfections etc., you need to apply two layers, so be aware of that and consider that before you buy this foundation because it is quite pricy."

			"review_text": "Okay lets chat about this lil treasure right here. I'm one of those people that depends solely on reviews for survival but never leaves them myself, however this has been my glow-to (ha) foundation for 5 years now, and I figured I owed it a review. First, the texture is beautiful. Silky, creamy, velvety, blends like a damn dream. I have light-medium olive skin, and in the winter I look like a sickly jaundiced child from the Civil War era, and in the summer I look like like a coconut husk, and I am able to stick with the same shade during both seasons because it truly melts into the skin without leaving any weird splotches or demarcations. I have pretty oily skin, and while I will say it is a dewy finish, as long as you top with setting powder (Fenty or Laura Mercier are my go-to's) you'll be good even if you have an olive oil factory living underneath your epidermis like me.  So tips and tricks I've learned during my 5 year relationship with this foundation: If you're using cream contour/color correcting, do it first and then apply this with a damp beauty blender or a dense buffing brush. If you use a flat foundation brush you're booking yourself a 1 way ticket to streak city. I like applying my cream highlight underneath as well (currently using Milks Holographic stick thing) and then foundation, concealer, set with powder, and then all my other powder products (blush, more highlighter (lol) bronzer, etc).  USE. A. PRIMER. A silicone one. No they wont clog your pores as long as you use a light gel moisturizer underneath as a barrier. I promise. I use the Sol No Poreblem primer and its dope. If you don't use a primer, it will separate on your nose halfway through the day. Its buildable, blendable, it can be dewy or matte, no shimmer, and it doesn't oxidize. Like, at all.  Also, Sephora doesnt carry it in the store, but go to Saks, get yourself color matched, and then buy your shade on Sephora online for samples and points."

Not to heavy or light. Very natural looking. Does not sink into my pores. Even though it is pricey I will never go back. The only con is the smell of the foundation is a bit chemical."

It has set the bar that high. It blended into my skin like Giorgio Armani custom made it just for me. I have never seen a foundation blend into the skin so well. There isn't even the slightest line of demarcation! It looks just like skin I couldn't tell the difference between where it was and where I knew it wasn't. The finish is absolutely beautiful its your skin but better! It has a light medium coverage that builds on itself beautifully to your desired coverage. Of course I wish it was cheaper or came with more but this is now my holy grail special foundation. Now with all that being said I do also want to point out I have combo-oily skin. I have been using tretinoin for the past 9 months my skin is pretty good at this point and I don't get as oily as I once did. I am in love! I have the power fabric arriving today and cant wait to test it out. <3 Armani"

Make-up can feel really bothersome, and even though I love it, I REALLY hate the feeling of foundation. MUFE HD was the closest I've come to not really feeling it and getting the coverage I wanted. In slinks the luminous silk foundation...it feels like nothing is there. After 16 hours! My sensory issues with foundation are alleviated, and y'all don't know how much that seemingly small thing impacts my life! It makes a huge difference. I cried because I was so happy to finally find a product like this!  My main complaint is that I do have to use more than I use of MUFE HD to get the coverage I want. I think this might be because the formula is thinner overall.   I can't recommend it enough. It's definitely a luxury product, but it's something I'll be willing to spring for because of how it feels and the difference it makes in my comfort level."

I'm OK with this bc it softens/blurs out my skin and I look more even toned.  it's not oil controlling so my t zone does get greasy but blotting and powder always helps.

It blends in seamlessly, provides a light, dewy finish, and lasts all day with primer, a touch of powder, and setting spray. Is it worth the price? I suppose that is relative, depending upon one's budget and priorities. I think it is, but I am also glad that my shade is available in the smaller, less expensive bottle, since a little goes a long way and I don't do a full face every day.

Shade 4.5 appeared more light-to-medium with warm/yellow undertones and the BB cream on me is more fair-to-light with neutral undertones. Understanding these are different solutions, which will show up differently on varying skin tones, this is more of a review for Sephora's Shade Finder feature than the Luminous Silk Foundation itself. Not an exact match, or even a similar/close one. I am sure the foundation itself is as luxurious as everyone makes it out to be, but now I am forced to go into the over-crowded Sephora store to find my match and exchange my current one.

It is very lightweight, almost having a watery feel to it. that made me nervous as I have imperfections I struggle to cover (And still look natural). don't let the consistency of it fool you, it's buildable. It takes me only 2 pumps to build to full coverage but the amazing thing is it looks natural, like a second glowing skin! It doesn't cake or patch up. It is the easiest foundation I've ever applied with my beauty blender. And it truly lasts all day. And if you have oily skin (like me) and worry about the luminous part of it, dont! it's the only foundation that I've tried that is able to give a healthy, pretty glow without it ever looking oily or just gross.  All in all, I will gladly pay the hefty price tag for this foundation over and over again. it's that good! just a warning: the shade depicted in the product picture (of it in the bottle) appears darker in my opinion than it actually is. I wear 1W2 Sand in Estee Lauder and 2.5 in UD All Nighter and got shade 4 in this. It's perfect for my fall/winter tone but for summer I will shade up 1-2 spots."

I recommend people to take many samples and do a full wear test in natural sunlight. When I sampled this foundation based on my usual foundation color and undertone, it dried down orange. Love the foundation but gotta knock off a star for terrible shade range and oxidizing. Color description isn’t super accurate.  Pro tip: if your closest Sephora doesn’t carry Armani beauty like mine, go to nearest Nordstrom to try it out. You can even get samples! I know that’s bad but Sephora’s beauty insider sale gives you a better price :/ capitalism am I right?"

This with the waleda skin food or the tatcha dewy skin cream underneath makes my dry skin look dewy and glowy. It lasts all day on my face and fades off nicely without looking patchy or cakey. My only gripe with this is the shade range. I have light skin with olive undertones, and I always struggle to find a shade that matches my skin. 4 is the closest I was able to get. If you have more medium skin with olive undertones, shade 6 is very olive but way too dark for me. If you're able to shell out the $$$ and mix two shades, try mixing 4 and 6 and you will get an perfect match for light olive skin."

This foundation is absolutely BEAUTIFUL. It's so light on the skin, feels like you have nothing on, yet.. still gives you the most beautiful coverage. I consider it a full/medium coverage.. because I build mine up to be more full but if you're into lesser coverage I still think you could love just a light layer.

I finally decided to just go for it and bought a bottle and I have to say, I was pretty disappointed. I’ll start with the pros/less negative parts; the coverage was ok, nothing amazing. It was moderately buildable and the finish wasn’t too glossy or matte, it was nicely in-between. I have combination skin, dry cheeks and a T-zone that tends to get oily so my biggest con was that it enhanced the dryness on my cheeks making it way more noticeable! It also started to break away and get cakey around my T-zone after a couple of hours. It also didn’t cover any blemishes or dark circles very well, even when I built it. Overall it was ok, but it wasn’t anything special. I can get the same results from much cheaper foundations (or BB creams), maybe even drugstore products, and that’s the problem. For this price, I expect my foundation to DELIVER and this one did not and for that reason, I decided to return it."

I’ve tried other brands throughout the years but haven’t found anything else better. It glides on beautifullly and provides light to medium coverage depending on how you apply although I find it works best with a brush. Works well with my combination skin where I’m drier on the cheeks and have slight shine on my nose and forehead. The result is a flawless skin and slight luminous glow that’s not shiny but more like you’re glowing from good health—a lit from within look. I already have good skin where people come up to me to compliment my skin but I use this foundation when I want a more polished look. It’s not a no-makeup look foundation (for that I use the GA Face Fabric foundation or Tom Ford powder foundation). This looks especially beautiful with either MUFF or It Cosmetics HD powder (if you’re not going to be in front of flash camera). Highly recommend! Totally worth it."

There is a 100% noticeable difference between these two batches. I may try and find the exact batch on the box soon, becuase the second one is not right at all. The first batch was easy to layer, as the second is almost sheer and takes forever to build up. I've noticed it's started to break me out also right as i began using the second batch. It also seems to irritate the areas that breakout. This second batch is almost like an entirely different foundation, even the shade on my face is a tad more pale than the first and i'm a homebody that stays one color, i dont tan unless it's fake. I'll definitely buy the product again however, because the first batch was undoubtedly flawless and lovely, but i'll definitely exchange for another bottle if i notice something odd. (note i did buy the exact shade and everything, not entirely sure as to what went wrong, but things happen :), dont let this scare you from buying the product, but if you use this foundation regularly and notice a difference, dont let your $ go to waste and just exchange for a better batch)"

I've always had trouble finding my shade and this one works perfectly, I also hate when I feel like I'm wearing foundation so this ticked off another one of my boxes. It has a natural finish so if you want something more full coverage this wouldn't be the best unless you want to pack it on but if you do have oily/dry patches it will look so off. Also it does not OXIDIZE which is huge because as a coloured person foundation tends to look orange on me at the end of the day i.e.MAC foundation look disastrous on me, I'd say I have a warm to neutral skin tone. I like to say I'm the forgotten shade in the makeup industry. The only reason I am not giving it a 5 star is because I can be a tough critic when it comes to my skin so when it comes to days when I have those acne eruptions it doesn't do much to cover them :( the white head comes poking out the foundation. Other than that I love this and I'm glad that Sephora is now carrying the full range because I use to buy it a Holt Renfrew (Canadian dept store) to purchase it."

So many pros to list:  -applies easily with a brush or sponge -flawless even coverage, about medium -layers well over sunscreen (Farmacy) and primer (Tatcha) -long wearing, 10+ hours if not more -does not settle into fine lines or pores -photographs beautifully, day or night  -perfect for mature skin, not too heavy but provides enough coverage for radiant flawless skin -so many compliments on my skin when I wear this, also hands down my husband’s favorite -loved by so many makeup artists, celebrities, and influencers for a reason   If you have mature combination skin and have not tried this foundation yet, I definitely recommend trying. I’m in love!! My only regret is that I did not try sooner. Better late than never. :)"

The packaging is pretty but will make it oxidize over time, I've had to exchange it a few times for new bottles. It's important to note that the coverage is absolutely medium and requires careful building as to not look cakey. I recommend applying it with the Marc Jacobs 'The Face II - Sculpting Foundation Brush No. 2' for higher coverage, and with a beauty blender for a more natural look. Use it with Guerlain's 'Météorites Primer Perfecting Pearls' for a soft glow in matte or radiant finish. It will enhance redness in acne if you do not colour correct beforehand."

Pros: This foundation is light to touch, soft matte finish, and does a fair job on evening my skin tone. Does not make my skin look overly cakey.   Cons: It does not cover my redness completely. I do need to build up coverage on blemish spots and even then it’s not total coverage. Foundation does cling a little bit to some areas around nose.

Even if u add another layer, it still maintains a beautiful finish. However after a couple of hours, I find it does become a little oily, but it still looks natural. No flashbacks. Yes, the price is high, but it’s totally worth it!!!!"

			"review_text": "To start, I think this foundation is good but since it doesn't meet all my wants/needs, I think it could be better given the $64 price tag.   My skin is dry in winter but I use moisturizing face lotions before applying makeup so my face gets oilier throughout the day. I don't own silicone based primers so I don't wear primers with this foundation. I prefer a light-medium coverage for my foundation and I find that this foundation works best for medium-full coverage. Too little product and the foundation is separating on my oily spots at the end of the day. Too much product and it looks like I'm wearing a mask.   I'm Asian and my skintone is light-medium and shade 4 is too light and 6 is too dark. 4's undertone matches me better (cool olive). Because the foundation is lighter than me, it does look a little white/gray when I wear it. To counter this, I put bronzer on the places where I'm naturally darker. This is a lot more work than I'm used to or like to do and I didn't want to buy #6 because that would mean I spent $128 for foundation that matches me...   Shade matching aside, I'm in love with how this foundation looks when it's dried down. It looks like skin and even when it's heavier it doesn't look cakey and dry. I have noticed though that on my undereye, it doesn't play well with my setting powder. Throughout the day, it settles into fine lines and looks dry but only on the undereye area, the rest of my face looks perfectly fine.   I think this foundation is worth it if you can find a shade that matches you perfectly. I do not think it's worth spending $128 on two bottles just to mix your shade. I don't mix this foundation with any of my other foundations because this (Armani) is primarily silicone based and all my other foundations are water based. Water and silicone don't mix well. I'm still keeping this foundation because my sensitive and acne-prone winter skin can tolerate it and that's more important to me."

It is now the end of the day and this foundation is still going strong! It has not set into lines and wrinkles or gotten cakey. I am pretty impressed! I have not used a foundation as good as this one before.....and I've tried LOTS of different brands from MUFE, Too Faced, Lancôme, etc. This one is BY FAR the best!  I am pretty fair and what I love about this foundation is that it does not oxidize. (Hard to find, for sure!) Not to mention this shade matches my skin tone perfectly. Granted, I am not a fan of the high price tag, but I'll pay it because in my opinion, it's worth it to FINALLY have a foundation that does everything it claims it will."

I love the natural radiant finish, I love how it wears, my skin just looks hydrated and gorgeous.    I will say it is not transfer free.  So setting powder is a must.  However if you have dry skin like me, don't over powder.  Just a light dusting in your trouble areas.  I use Hourglass sewing powder or the YSL radiant finishing powder.  Both keep me from looking cakey on top of  this gorgeous foundation.   Yes, it's a bit more pricey than  some but it's a dream.  I love it.  I have some backup foundations that work but this is my favorite."

I usually avoid setting with too much powder, but I’ve found by the end of the day no matter how much primer, powder and setting spray I’ve put on, my nose is exposed. This wouldn’t be a big deal, but I have redness throughout my skin so it ends up with a Rudolph effect that’s not cute. I carried it around for touch-ups because I was determined to make this work, but honestly I shouldn’t have to at this price point and supposed quality ingredients.

(Laneige,FAB,Dior,Marc Jacobs,Too Faced,Giorgio Armani), all samples that I took home and tried on different  days.  Each one had a different effect on my skin.  Everyday, I would use my Clarisonic for my face, toner, essence, serum, moisturizer,spf then primer (tatcha canvas).  Then use one of the foundation samples then bronzer.  I have dry/combination skin.  This foundation did not feel dry on my skin nor did it make my t-zone shinny in the midday or so.  It will give you a really nice natural finish throughout the day, at least for me.  I do think with my skin type, you really have to make sure that your skin is moisturized.  This was the only foundation (out of the six) that did not give me a shinny t-zone or dry skin patches or foundation settling between your fine lines.  I do think you should try as many samples foundation (including this one) so you can find that is right for your skin."

I don't have to blot as often as I would if it was another foundation and most importantly of all, I look like me.                                                                                   I have learned, however, that when I apply my matte finish water-based moisturizer from Shiseido, I apply the moisturizer while my face is still wet and then apply the foundation.  Turned out to be great.  The only complaint I really have is by 2:00, (applied at 7:30 a.m.) the foundation does seem to disappear, so that's why I gave it four stars instead of five."

I've never seen my skin look so pretty for hours and hours.  Let's just say this foundation made my face look as pretty as I'd always hoped it could be!  Yes, it is pricey, but I decided it was worth it.  I won't be using it as an everyday makeup, but I have other less expensive foundations that work okay for just running to the store and such.  I will be using this for times when I want to be sure my face looks youthful (like on dates!)."

I would prefer a full coverage foundation but Luminous Silk is the only hydrating foundation that dries to a natural, satiny finish.  If you have dry skin but hate dewy foundations that move around your face and never set, give Luminous Silk a try.    My only complaints are that I'm not crazy about the fragrance (although it's tolerable and not reeking of cheap perfume like Huda Faux Filter) and the shades could be better.  4 is supposed to be my shade but it doesn't have quite enough yellow for me and the next shade up is too dark so I have to mix in a little of my L'Oreal Pro Glo since I'm not about to pay $64 for another bottle of Luminous Silk just for mixing."

I'd say it's a light coverage that can be built up and still looks great when layered.  The texture is fairly thin, and blends easily.  It lives up to the name... luminous finish, but doesn't look greasy.  The only negative thing about it is that you only get 1 fl oz for $64, and because I sometimes need to use a little extra to make up for the lighter coverage I don't think it will last long enough for me to just overlook the price.  The appearance and performance of Luminous Silk are what make me want to say that it's worth the price tag.  I definitely recommend this and would totally buy it again!"

I can’t rave enough about it. The only thing that would make it perfect is if it were a little bit fuller coverage, as I have to use 3 pumps to cover the entirety of my face to the coverage I like. That’s only when I’m going for full coverage though. The finish is more of a satin finish on my skin personally, which I like because I can make myself look more dewy with highlight.

I am always looking for a good foundation to battle my oily t-zone. I found this offered a light, natural coverage. I honestly prefer a more buildable or full coverage, so this was a somewhat of a disappointment. I also found that by mid-day, the foundation had oxidized.  I am curious if a lighter shade might have helped, as the 7.75 was slightly too dark for me. I doubt I will be purchasing this as I need more coverage and prefer more of a matte finish."

Literally finishes as second skin, I even got all my friends on this foundation. Recently I repurchased the bottle and the payoff is lighter, I noticed I looked lighter in my pictures too. I also use very minimal product on my face to give it a natural finish, but something is just off. I exchanged in store for a new bottle thinking I might have recieved a bad batch, new bottle did the same thing. Finally I compared product from my old bottle with product from the new one, I see a significant difference between the two. Emailed sephora customer service about it, they recommended that I buy another shade and mix it. Hmmm one bottle is already pricey enough...??? Also I did try shade 6, 5.25, 5.5 to see if they matched better. They didn’t. Heads up to anyone repurchasing this product, keep your old bottle around and compare the swatches."

			"review_text": "I’ve been waiting for this gem to come to my local Sephora and finally won the prize.  Applied with a brush, with a 1/2 pump for each side of the face, this foundation blends flawlessly.  It’s been a long time since I’ve used foundation, preferring a tinted moisturizer, or lighter coverage, but needed something else for more coverage.  No other foundation worked.  Certainly this is buildable, but I don’t think using a sponge applicator works best, though it’s fine for further blending out.  I have oily skin in the summer and combination in the cooler months.  I used this over Coola matte mineral sunscreen and it disposed of the slight cast, while the matte “primer” toned down the luminous quality in the warmer months.  I believe a primer is absolutely necessary for this, or any other foundation.  Without one, it applied ok on me, but it’s longevity was much shorter.  Otherwise, longevity was a solid six hours in the warmer temps, 8 hours in cooler temps.  I didn’t notice any oxidation, but had my normal T zone issue after a while.  Depending on your skin type, you may need to lightly powder if you also use a powder blush.  Liquid blush went directly over the foundation, but I haven’t the knack with it.  Overall, the foundation really was luminous, not shiny and the color selection available assures nearly everyone that a match exists.    I will comment that, as much as I appreciate the skin matching efforts that the ladies at Sephora made, the color matched to me, 3.5, was too yellow in sunlight.  I returned for a neutral undertone, 4.5, and am happy.  The moral of that story, I suppose, is to check the tested shade in several kinds of light before committing to it."

I’ve tried drugstore brands. If a YouTuber, or instagram makeup guru recommended it, I’d try it. There was always somethings little “off” about everything I tried. Either it oxidized on my face, settled into fine lines, not enough coverage, too much coverage, sat on top of my skin, broke me out, or it was too fragranced.  I always shyed away from the Armani despite its fantastic reviews because of the price. Sometimes you do get what you pay for bc this foundation is perfection! I cannot see it on my face, I cannot feel it in my face, I cannot smell it on my face, and my face looks flawless!  I tried it both with primer, without primer, with moisturizer, without moisturizer, and with moisturizer and primer, and it came out flawless every time. Even after hours of wear it does not oxidize, settle or get funky. I don’t set it either.  I used the Sephora shade finder online and matched it to a foundation shade that suits me that I already own. I highly suggest buying this in your perfectly matched shade, you will be glad you did. I find it light enough and comfortable enough to wear everyday, but enough coverage to go glam."

			"review_text": "To briefly describe what I love about this foundation— a gorgeous satin finish that mimics Photoshop and beauty filters, a light breathable texture that leaves my dry to normal skin feeling fresh and never cakey, and a shade range that thoughtfully includes an olive undertoned 6 that is perfect for my summer-tanned skin. I like mixing it with the lightest neutral yellow- based 3 as my complexion gets paler through the colder months. Though this foundation doesn't boast longwear, I don't really mind because it wears off evenly and my skin still looks great at the end of the day, albeit with less coverage. I suppose the only thing I don't love is the price, but I've paid for foundations ranging from dirt cheap to more expensive than this (I know, I'm crazy) and I can't say that anything comes even close— this is truly in a tier of its own.  I'll even be the first to admit... whenever a beauty guru or YouTube influencer claims this foundation is overhyped, I lose faith in their other recommendations. Yes, I do realize it's unrealistic to expect a product to be a one-size-fit-all, as we all have varying skin types and personal preferences. But my reasoning is if this foundation really didn't work for someone (with an exception to negative reactions from ingredients), I can safely assume they either have very different skin concerns or an incompatible makeup style to mine. If you are on the market for an amazing medium coverage foundation, not quite matte and not quite dewy, but 100% your skin but better, I wholeheartedly urge you to give this a go. Get a couple samples of shades that you think would match you since the numbering system can be confusing at first. But the hassle? Worth it. Bottom line, Luminous Silk is everything I've ever wanted in a holy grail foundation and more. I would literally be devastated if Armani ever discontinued this. Luckily for me, lots of people seem to love this just as much as I do so I don't imagine I'll ever be without it!"

I have been trying out a lot of foundations recently and this one is amazing. I find that this foundation looks best when applied with a brush and buffed into the skin. It is a medium coverage but buildable to full if desired. It doesn’t look cakey or flat on the skin. It has a nice satin finish and is indeed luminous. It gives the skin a healthy glow, it doesn’t look at all oily or greasy though. It lasts well throughout the day, not separating, fading or transferring. It lasts well through heat, humidity and sweat also which is a bonus if you live in a hot climate! I love how this looks and feels on my skin. The only downside is the price, it is $64 USD. However, if you have the money to invest in this product I would highly recommend it! It lives up to its reputation."

The best part is that you don’t need to apply too much because it has very good coverage and it blends in so well.

But this foundation is the ONLY one out of the tons I've tried that doesn't do that. And this is the only foundation that I dont need to set and yet still looks beautiful at the end of my 15 hour day. So.. I can ditch putting powder on my dry skin and not end up with a dry mess on my face at the end of the day. Worth the splurge! I've never spent over $50 on a foundation so I don't suggest this without knowing it's expensive. Coverage is on the medium side, I have light/medium skin with a few acne scars."

And the Sephora staff always wants to match me with such yellow colors in store. I picked this one out and they tested it on me and were so surprised that it was perfect with my pink undertones. Haha. Anyway, I love that it's lightweight and lasts the whole work day - perfect for humid Houston. It just evens out my skin tone and makes it look like my skin is so nice!

I’d stay away from this if you have oily skin, which I do, but I still give it 5 stars because it’s amazing for what it is!"

			"review_text": "I want to start by saying thank you to Giorgio Armani and influenced her for allowing me to participate and this review campaign. Well I was given this product to review my opinions are my own. I must say straight from the gate I love the complexity of this Foundation the color is unlike something I've ever seen with my particular undertone there only a few Brands I can go to without having to adjust the formula more cool or less warm. But this Foundation was the perfect match to my undertone. If you take this foundation and you spray it with a bit of water you see the green pigment. My particular golden tone has green and this Foundation caters to that. Whoever formulated these colors really understand skin. Next let's talk about how this Foundation looks on the skin the skin just looks like skin it's amazing it Blends well with a brush or a beauty blender and I made sure to try this product several times before I gave her review I received this product last week but I wanted to make sure I did my due diligence working this product. I found this product to be a team player she works well with other products and does what she supposed to do. The first day I tried I wouldn't for a sheer coverage a coverage that I prefer I don't have too much discoloration and the small discoloration I do have I can touch conceal but I like for my skin to radiate. The second time I used to starvation I bulked up the coverage with two drops instead of one like the first day. Also if you need to lightly rehydrate Andre blend if you need to adjust for your personal skin tone this Foundation is very forgiving in that manner. When I look for a foundation I look for performance color ease of use and longevity. This Foundation satisfies all of those requirements. I'm not a full coverage girl so I'm not particularly looking for full coverage but you most certainly build the coverage with this Foundation. This will be my new go-to now that prescriptives custom blend is no longer in the mall"

It’s lightweight, but builds nicely so you can customize your look daily. It blends out nicely and leaves a nice, dewy finish.  It’s not really matte, but also not greasy looking. Very natural which is what I live for! I normally use 3-4 pumps of my MAC foundation, but with this formula it takes 1.5-2 pumps AT MOST for a full coverage. It will take even less on a minimal makeup kind of day. Don’t let the price scare you... it’s definitely worth the price and you will get plenty of uses out of the bottle!!"

I have dry/normal skin and I get oily very rarely, but dryness is my main concern so I typically go for dewy, hydrating foundations. This foundation did not disappoint and lived up to its name “luminous silk.” I got the color 11.75 and used a buffing brush to apply it. I loved how it glided effortlessly on my skin and felt so light — I hate the feeling of a foundation choking my skin. The coverage was pretty great and buildable too. I have one or two acne scars that need a little extra attention, and this mostly covered them (I supplemented the remaining coverage with my concealer). I also noticed that this has a light, pleasant smell that I’m not used to in foundations. I personally am not opposed to fragrance in things so I enjoy it and definitely prefer it to the chemical smell I sometimes get in other foundations. I love this product and can’t say enough good things and love that I can rock it for work or a night out. — This foundation was sent to me for review."

I mixed it with a little of my BECCA Backlight primer and it was gorgeous and light coverage for running errands as well.  There’s a slight scent like most high-end foundations, but it dissipated quickly and wasn’t overpowering.  I also have very sensitive skin and it didn’t break me out.

It provides great coverage & if you need a little more on certain areas you can build & layer without it looking to caked. Personally having dry, combination skin it really leaves a natural dewy look. Just light and sheer enough, light to medium coverage.• It retails to $64 standard size of 30 ml, also comes in a travel size of $42 in 18 ml. • I highly recommend this product, I definitely see myself purchasing it!  #influenster #giorgioarmani #giorgioarmanibeauty #makeup #sephora #armanibeauty #complimentary #free #reviews #sheerfoundation #makeupreview #luminoussilkfoundation #influenstervoxbox #voxbox #luxuryproducts #highend #luxeathome"

			"review_text": "Let me start off but stating I did get the wrong color! I should have gotten 6.5 but instead I got 8.75. ALSO, I did receive this product for FREE from influenster for testing purposes but all opinions are my own! And this is my honest opinion:...  The smell reminds me of sunscreen but I’m not sure if it has spf in it. I don’t see it say it on the box or anything. The formula is very liquidity but kinda hard to work with. Since it has a velvety finish, I feel like it starts to dry quick and is hard to blend with beauty blender. Also, this is definitely a sheer TO medium coverage. It is very sheer and light weight. If you want a medium coverage, I suggest letting first coat dry COMPLETELY and the. Apply second. You get 1 go oz. Averge size even though bottle seems small. This has a lot of pros and cons. Doesn’t help that I got the wrong shade as well. But when it does finally dry it has this powdery velvety finish with BEAUTIFUL luminous reflected specks. This seems perfect for oily skin! If you want to glow but not look oily I. The process. Great concept and formula idea, however; like I said be before this is patchy.  I would recommend applying powder on afterwards because it can still feel a little sticky even after it dries. I’m torn on this foundation. I love the velvet finish with luminosity. And I love light weight foundation that feels like you have nothing on but hate the patchy and mild sticky feeling. I’m going to try again but maybe with my correct color and see how I feel towards it.  I would recommend this to someone who is skilled with make up and who can really blend."

Other than that, blends super well and does not leave you with a greasy/oily finish but instead with a nice glow. Medium coverage, as some imperfections still shine through after two layers, which I like. Nice smell too."

I just need a couple more drops to build to an even medium coverage and then use concealer to cover/blend out my acne marks.   Formula is incredibly lightweight and pigmented!

I personally love this foundation because I like to go for a more natural look and this foundation makes it look like I am not wearing makeup. It really does a great job at the no makeup, makeup look because numerous people have asked me if I was even wearing foundation.  This foundation is definitely not full-coverage, but it is buildable. When I want more coverage in certain areas I will apply more foundation. This is a great foundation for covering up acne scars and discoloration of the skin, allowing you to have that flawless finish. The reason why this foundation looks so much like your natural skin is because it is not hiding your skin completely. Parts of my natural features on my face comes through which is what I love. It enhances what is there, but doesn't completely get rid of it. Also, this is my first time posting, but I had to because this foundation is literally amazing. It is definitely one of the more expensive foundations, but it does last! (My other favorite foundation I was using before this was Too Faced Born This Way Foundation-definitely more coverage, but another amazing foundation that gives you a flawless face, and it is a cheaper alternative)"

It's a perfect match for my very pale skin. It makes my skin look better than natural- like, naturally airbrushed. I apply it by spreading it out on my face with a flat brush and blending it in with a Beauty Blender. I feel like that uses the smallest amount of product to give the perfect amount of coverage.  This foundation is definitely a light to a light-medium coverage. It's great for evening out the skin tone and giving you a healthy glow. I consider it a My Skin But (Way) Better foundation.   Sometimes it does cling to flakiness/dry spots/healing acne, but with a good primer (MUFE's Step 1 Smoothing Primer is a good one), and/or a good moisturizer as a base, this issue is greatly improved.  I've tried quite a few foundations, but I always go back to this one. The way it looks on camera, the lightweight feel. that really gorgeous and sheer airbrushed look is like nothing else out there and I definitely consider it worth the money."

I like that it offers medium, buildable coverage, is good for most skin types, has a natural finish, and the full size comes in a pump bottle (yay!).  I have used it several times now. There’s a slight scent to it (mentioned in case that bothers you). I applied with a brush, with minimal effort. It dries really fast and does feel weightless and uniquely silk-like, which feels luxurious. In building up the coverage, it did get cake-y around my nose (so use less there). I didn’t need a setting powder at all, which is amazing. It looks so good, I considered buying the mini.   However, it doesn’t wear well through my typical work day. True, it’s humid here in Honolulu, but I can usually get away with using a blotting paper mid-day to sop up excess oil in my t-zone. But I needed TWO and my forehead still looked greasy, highlighting my poor texture there. This is a dealbreaker. I’m willing to spend more on foundation that will make me look good 30 days a month, through good skin days and hormonal acne.  In conclusion, this is an excellent foundation but it might not work for people with oily skin."

It separated on my face after a few hours (my nose area was terrible), as well as was very shiny, even with setting powder. The transfer was terrible. This foundation is said to not settle into fine lines/wrinkles. This is not true, if anything, this foundation made my forehead wrinkles look even worst.

			"review_text": "I got a sample of this in shades 3.5 and 6. This made my skin look flawless. I love the natural look of the Power Fabric when prepped properly, and this did not disappoint. It looks totally natural. Probably the only foundation I've tried that doesn't sink into fine lines and makes my skin look better.  My only complaint is the shade range; I'm about an NC25ish, with true olive (green/gray) undertones.  Shade 4.5 matches me pretty ok in Power Fabric, but there is no equivalent in the Luminous Silk.  Shade 6 comes close, but it's too dark.  Shade 4 has similar undertones, but it's too light. Shade 3.5 is deeper than 4.5, but not as deep as 6 and has warm, kinda peachy undertones, which doesn't jive with my olive undertones(it shows up orange or pink on my muted,grayish skin).   I usually settle with golden or yellow undertones, but I feel like all the shades that could match me in this foundation are too pink. The rest are too dark.  I mixed 3.5 and 6 when I got samples and it was almost a match. I think I am going to get shade 4 and just use bronzer or something.  I really wish brands, especially high end brands, would start bringing out light and light-medium shades with olive undertones, or at least golden. Not everybody is yellow,peach,or pink.  Kind of a fail for the price point and such a disappointment as the formula is absolutely flawless. I've read about supposed dupes but nothing lives up to this.  If you can find your shade or an ok shade that you could settle with and have more dry skin/want a more dewy, but not oily, natural look, try this. It's gorgeous.  It lasts all day and actually looks better throughout the day. Crappy shade range aside, I adore this and it's going to be my new HG if shade 4 is workable."

It looked good throughout the evening I wore it, but started to separate slightly around the 5-hour mark, like a typical foundation on normal/combo skin. The coverage was plenty for my needs/taste, I would say it is medium (of course depending on how much and how you apply, I used a sponge). It didn't particularly highlight pores and texture, but it didn't minimize them either. All in all there was nothing bad about this foundation, but for me personally there are plenty of other products on the market for $20-$50 less that perform equally well. It actually performed very similarly to my go-to K-beauty BB cream (which usually sells for $13), just with a bit more coverage. It goes a long way, so it's not a bad investment if you love it, but it just didn't live up to the hype on my skin. Since I'm trying to avoid liquid foundation altogether right now due to clogged pores, it'll probably be going back."

It’s definitely expensive but I don’t see myself going back to any foundation and any other full coverage foundation just looks cakey to me now. Love love love."

I have very fair, cool toned, DRY and sensitive skin with a tiny bit of redness. Though the name implies it has a dewy or “luminous” finish to it, the people I have seen really loving on it have preferred the matte look and had mostly normal or combo skin. I got over it and decided to just get it.  I think this foundation is wonderful. I have never had a foundation match my skin so well without having to mix 2 or even 3 shades together. I am a 3.75. It doesn’t cling to any of my dry spots (which was my biggest fear) it doesn’t appear to sit on top of the skin, rather it looks LIKE my own skin with a beautiful luminous finish. Like I said I’m dry so I’m not big on caking on the powder. I just lightly set my face with powder at the end of my makeup routine. No baking. This foundation still doesn’t slip around or get eaten up even though I don’t cake on the powder. This foundation is also very long wearing as long as you properly set it. Good for long days or photography. For extra coverage in those situations (and to set it even more) you can go in with the powder foundation version of this over top the liquid foundation. It also plays well with most of my other foundations and concealers. Fantastic! I have only one complaint and it’s not even really a problem with the foundation itself but the PRICE. WHEW! In my opinion though I would repurchase this as I don’t wear it as my “every day” foundation. I stick to my L’Oréal Pro Glow foundation for day to day and my Armani for special occasions, when I want to look extra snatched and when I need my makeup to last all day/night. Great foundation! I recommend!"

A little goes a long way, and I only use maybe 2 small pumps for my entire face. I find it best to apply in VERY thin layers by dabbing a few dots on my face, PUSHING it into the skin using some type of dense flat top buff brush (I use the KA Angled Foundation Brush or a Chanel foundation brush   Sigma F80 combo), and then adding an extra dot for additional coverage only where needed. I've noticed that when too much product is used, or it's just painted on the skin instead of pressed in, it looks cake-y and unflattering.   It's a perfect color match if you're somewhere in the 3y07, 3y08, 3y09 color range (medium to tan skin with yellow, olive undertones). I don't normally go for peachy undertone products but in this case it helps to counteract redness.   Also, it holds up well throughout the day, I usually only have to dab away oil once during the day, and most importantly, it doesn't clog my freaking pores!"

Yet I look flawless and glowing especially in the first 2 hours. And then it starts to go weird on me, floating and separating in this weepy way that reflects the sadness in my heart. Maybe it's great for a night out, but I don't collect foundations; I need a multitasker. Sorry, Luminous Silk, it was amazing while it lasted (literally)."

If you have very dry skin and sometimes find foundations causing your skin to flake by the end of the day, id say stay away."

Yes, it is buildable, but I had to build it on 2 times to cover my scars, conceal, and do touch-ups. ALSO, the colors are terrible. Everything is too yellow or too gray,  only an outer space alien would wear these colors. So gross. Overall, beautiful finish, great for dry skin, horrible color range and coverage is moderate, Plus, i got a few breakouts with this, but not severe breakouts (like MUFE HD or Born This Way).

It stays put, makes my skin look creamy and dewy but not oily. It's medium to full coverage, which is what I like for when I am doing a full face of makeup. Despite the fact that I was matched at 3 Armani counters, this color was selected when I went into Sephora and let them color match me for all foundations. Every makeup artist at Armani had me in either 5.0 (winter shade) or 5.25 (summer shade). Well it's only spring right now, but this 4.25 is the best match ever! So not only am I writing to say how much I love the foundation (wrong or right color!) but I HIGHLY encourage everyone to let Sephora use that color match gun on your skin to get your true shade match. Shout out to the Sephora team in Burlingame, CA for convincing me to do this. You guys ROCK."

I am glowing! It gives a natural soft look. I’ve been wearing Hourglass veil primer underneath and lightly set with LM. My skin is combination with an oily nose that nothing seems to control for more than 4 or 5 hours. But I noticed this foundation keeps the oil away. I prep, prime, and set the same way for every foundation but this one lasts all day without getting slick! It works best with a beauty blender and layered, instead of one thick coat. It just melts into my skin. The price tag is a little high, and my local Sephora doesn’t carry it, which is why I took the star off. But I love it otherwise and will definitely repurchase!!"

I could not blow my nose or wipe my mouth without wiping off all the foundation from that area even before my oils came through. I then began placing baby powder after my primer and before my foundation on my oily areas. I set the foundation with the Laura Mercier translucent powder applied with a beauty blender after the foundation application and it has changed everything! I love it! For my oily skin this has helped. If I am going to be gone for a long amount of time (more than 12 hours) I use the urban decay all nighter setting spray. I love this foundation and the look it gives my skin. Other products blend perfectly with this foundation. By setting it with the Laura mercier powder on the beauty blender it prevents transfer when I blow my nose, but there is still some transfer.

I always receive compliments when wearing it. It is definitely worth it my only wish is we got more bang for our buck meaning more oz. But this is the only foundation I have ever repurchased. It gives me a radiant dewy but not oily looking but natural finish. & The color match is perfect but go into the store and try it first because it is tricky finding the perfect shade & recently more shades were added!!"

			"review_text": "I am a doublewear fan through and through, but I wanted something lighter and more radiant to wear at my upcoming wedding. My color IQ stated I should purchase shade 4.5 (which was too dark for my winter skin). I ended up purchasing shade 2 (still too light; I plan on purchasing 4.5 to mix into it in the near future). I wanted to try Luminous Silk (LS) due to the claim that it does not crease, and that it covers skin issues seamlessly. I have tried almost every foundation sold at Sephora, and I must admit, LS is one of my top 10. I have combination skin with acne (oily forehead, dry patches everywhere else). I also have VERY deep creases in my forehead (that all other foundations seem to highlight more). I tested this foundation for 12 hours. It was applied with a damp beauty blender, on top of Bobbi Brown vitamin enriched primer, and finished with UD setting spray. PROS to LS: 1.This is one of the only foundations that does not excessively crease in my forehead wrinkles/smile lines. 2. The finish of this foundation is gorgeous! It literally looks like skin. 3. I did not feel like I had foundation on; it’s so light and breathable. 4. It applied and blended with ease; no streaks or patches on dry skin areas, no breakage on oily skin areas.  5. The packaging is gorgeous AND the foundation has a pump!  6. Although some did transfer, the foundation still looked present/intact at the end of the day. CONS: 1. Price, not accessible to everyone.  2. The shade range is less than satisfactory. LS did not have a true match for my skin tone (2 was too light and a bit too neutral. The only other shades available that slightly matched were very yellow, not golden like my undertone). 3. I used Laura Mercer translucent powder to bake on my oily areas on top of LS. The powder did cause my forehead creases to stand out a bit more. 4. LS will transfer. Not terribly, but it does move. 5. This is not a full-coverage foundation. It did not cover my acne (2 layers)."

I took it off 30 minutes later so I could go to bed. BIG MISTAKE!!! The next morning I put it on and I was feeling myself, lol. When I got to work I had meetings all morning. After my meetings, about 3 hours after application, I went to the restroom. I looked in the mirror and was MORTIFIED. It was broken up all over my face; it looked HORRIBLE. I was so embarrassed that I immediately took it off, in the restroom, at work and just went natural the rest of the day. Going natural was not a good look because I am pretty red.   I did not understand why this happened. I was determined to make it work so I waited until the weekend and experimented with it. It did the same thing on Saturday and Sunday. This foundation DID NOT look good on me; at all.   DISCLAIMER***This foundation seemed really watery. Maybe I got a defective one??? I don't know, but the one I recieved was HORRIBLE. It is going to be returned tomorrow."

I'm dryer than a desert and normally get dry flaky patches on my nose after the FOUR HOUR mark. BUT, I WAS FINE ALL DAY.

This is my review for dry skin, slightly acne prone slightly texture skin.  The colour on my skin was wack, I have light skin with rosy undertones but this looked like white out on my face.The next shade with my proper undertone was for medium skin.   Foundation blends pretty good but come on its medium coverage, how thick can it be if its mostly water, alcohol denant and cyclopentasiloxane  Coverage was disappointing if im using a 70$ foundation i want it to cover at least some of my redness and dont want to have to use multiple layers.  The finish is what threw me for the biggest loop, i know some brand like Nars will have foundation names that suggest quite dewy but are more mate or satin but this was medium coverage marketed as luminous so i thought it would have a bit more of a wet look. nope looked quite powdery and drying on the skin  Price is expected for a prestige brand but the value isn't there because of the need to build. The packaging is vanity candy though,it just says i'm boujee  Overall i'm disappointed and quite surprised because of all the hype, would probably work best for someone who uses a brush for their foundation ( I used hands and brush and brush looks best ) I'd be wary to us with a sponge because its watery and again this is $70 foundation that needs to be build a bit so you'd want all the coverage you can get. I'd suggest this for someone with more normalized oil levels which already has quite smooth skin and little acne and discoloration. The BEST way i got this to work is by mixing some facial oil in to counteract the mattifying effect, spot conceal redness and imperfections with a concealer either before or after and stipple on a layer concentrating on center of face."

I looked high and low for a product with said qualities, and finally, I tried this foundation. The first time I put it on, I literally looked in the mirror and said, “Oh, my goodness.” I couldn’t believe how beautiful this product left my skin looking. My flaws were covered, but my skin still looked like skin, rather than a mask. My skin was hydrated and glowing. The rest of my makeup, both cream and powder products, sat on top of this foundation beautifully.   I see why this foundation has such a positive reputation. My favorite way to apply this product is with a Beauty Blender (BB) because it leaves a flawless, airbrushed look. It takes me 2-3 pumps to cover my face and neck. Yes, the product is thin and the BB soaks up some of the product, so you may prefer to use your fingers or a brush, which also work well. This product builds beautifully into a medium coverage foundation, so don’t be afraid to apply a second layer. The finish is in between dewy and satin, and can be adjusted based on the type of primer you use and whether or not you use a setting powder. With a primer (I use BECCA’s purple primer or Josie Maran’s Finishing Balm), this foundation lasts me eight hours or more. My concealer, bronzer, and highlighter all look lovely on top of this foundation. There is a slight chemical/makeup smell, but it goes away shortly after applying.   This product is expensive, yes, but to me, it is worth the splurge since it is so hard for me to find a foundation that I really like and that matches my skin tone. I am a NC37 (medium with yellow undertones) and shade 6.5 matches me perfectly."

			"review_text": "I had such a difficult time figuring out my correct shade, so I really hope this helps someone not have the same troubles!!  lol  If you are an NC25 then you might want to try this first in the 3.5 shade.  I received a sample in 5.5 and loved the finish and texture, but knew it was too dark (like the type of dark where you know you could wear it in the summer but can't pull off in the winter).  So I made my purchase in #5 without testing it first.  #5 is definitely too neutral and light for an NC25.  In fact, it's almost pinkish or perhaps just too beige.  I never tried 4.5, 5.75, or 6, but I've heard 5.75 is darker than 6 and that 6 is for NC30 olive skin.  So, just to organize it:  3.5= NC25 4.5= maybe a more neutral NC25 ?? 5= beige NC20 5.5= somewhere between NC30 and NC35 5.75= maybe NC35 ?? 6= NC30 olive  As far as the foundation itself, I love it.  I have combo-dry skin with acne scars and I think this does a great job blurring acne scars/ acne pits aka pock marks.  It's not a miracle, but I think it does a good job.  You will need to set with a powder, but the finish is very skin like and natural.  Dry skin will love this.    Those with oily skin might want to sample before purchasing."

I love my Hourglass Vanish, and my MUFE HD, but my hand will immediately gravitate to Armani.   What it did - Covered all my redness, and truly did look “luminous”, and natural. Usually I need to go in with concealer around some of my breakouts, didn’t have to with this foundation. Didn’t set it, and I still looked bomb during the end of the night. (Maybe because I’m not oily). My mother even liked it, and she usually hates my foundations LOL.   What it didn’t do - Didn’t look cakey, cling onto my dryness, no patchiness, bring out some of my bumpy texture, harsh smile lines/forehead lines/between the brow lines, move around with the rest of my products, transfer onto people.  TRUE this is a bit pricey... but we spend god knows how much on our skin care, and eyeshadow palettes that sometimes just sit there. So why not spend an extra few bucks on a foundation that is seriously a god send. - Just pay your rent first! LOL."

It doesn't matter what type of foundation I use-powder, liquid, cream-my base will be sliding off my face by the end of the day. I've always bought matte or long lasting formulas to delay the inevitable, but what I find is that many of those type of formulas end up looking heavy. I've begun trying luminous formulas to achieve a more skin-like finish. Now that I've tried this, I'm not going back.  Do I get shiny? Yes. But that would happen with any foundation (it's been a long road to acceptance). The difference is that this foundation makes my skin look SO good. I have redness along my cheeks and nose, it evens out those areas effortlessly. It leaves a satin finish that looks like you're not wearing anything, just soft, glowing skin.  I have to use a loose powder to set (Laura Mercier, Kat Von D and Ben Nye all work well), and I do have to blot later in the day. It gets me through the workday, but if I'm heading out after work, I definitely need to touch up. That's not bad, considering how oily my skin is.  I have light medium olive skin. In general, it's difficult to find foundations to match my undertone. Armani foundations lean more pink to neutral. I use shade 6.0. It has a golden undertone compared to the other shades, but I wish they could make it just a smidge more yellow, because it does lean neutral. I'm being nit picky, because the shade works, most can't tell that the undertone is slightly off. That's the other thing! My coworkers thought I had stopped using foundation, they thought I had perfect skin. The biggest con is the cost. It is expensive, and I danced around the thought of buying it for a year. I got a couple samples to find the right shade. Then I waited for one of the VIB sales to purchase. But this is worth every penny, I would buy it at full price."

My big beef is that shade 5 is WAY too light and shade 5.5 is WAY too dark.  I'll make the 5 work because I'm not spending $120 mixing shades when I don't wear foundation more than once a week.  I have yellow/olive undertones and the undertone is fine.  It feels soft without feeling slippery.  I def don't get a shine from it and I don't set it with powder."

I initially discovered it when I was trying out foundations to wear on my wedding day (I did my own makeup). I normally like a medium-full coverage foundation and this is the first foundation that has given me the type of coverage I like while still looking skin-like and natural. It doesn’t completely cover a couple spots of pigmentation(scarring) that I have on my face but I don’t mind it because of how gorgeous it looks on the skin. It has such a pretty finish, not “dewy” but it’s definitely radiant- in a very non-artificial way. I have nothing bad to say about this foundation, it’s incredible. I don’t have nice skin by any stretch of the imagination- I have a LOT of scarring and pigmentation and sometimes active spots & acne, but when I find a product that makes people stop and compliment me on my skin, I take notice! I can’t stand how expensive it is compared to other foundations I use, but the price won’t stop me from buying it. It’s the best I’ve ever used!"

I did some research online for the best foundation for dry skin and came across this Giorgio Armani foundation. Shade (8) matches my skin perfectly and it spreads nicely with my beauty blender. Just one pump covers my whole face lightly and leaves a silky, dewy finish. If I need a bit more coverage, two pumps will do it. This foundation is well worth the price. I highly recommend it."

At first I thought it was the primer I use (YSL Touch eclait) so I switched to another primer but it didn’t matter because with either primer the foundation took longer than I’m willing to spend to smooth it out. If you don’t mind taking a bit longer with your makeup then go for it but if your morning makeup routine needs to be complete in 30 minutes then keep looking. I felt like for the price I paid it should work with any primer. I’m sticking to my other cheaper foundations that apply better and look better."

It doesn't dry out my skin (or at least it doesn't worsen patches that are already dry), it's decently glowy/dewy-ish, and it has very noticeably good coverage without feeling like you dumped a bucket of paint on your face (in fact, it doesn't feel like you're wearing much foundation at all).

I love the dewy, lively finish that it gives me. It makes my skin look so fresh and awake. I find that the shades are true to the description. I will say that I gave it four stars because it claims to be very easy to build up from a medium to a fuller coverage foundation, and no matter how much I apply, I do not find it to be particularly full coverage. However, a very minor complaint, and I use concealer to cover the areas that need a little bit more love (under eye, around my nose, chin).

The Armani is very similar to tarte but it's a little more high end.  This foundation I would put around the light to medium spectrum for coverage. It is buildable depending on how much you use, and I use it for more medium coverage. I have some texture and discolouration issues with my skin, and luminous silk gives me enough coverage while keeping my skin natural looking.  The formula is very thin and dries in an average time so no need to do your face in sections. I place it in dots around my face and blend with a beauty blender. The only thing I will say is if you have breakouts it won't cover but you can go on with concealer to touch up those spots. The packaging is glass which is what I would expect for this price point."

I have super dry skin and do layers of moisturizers and serums day & night  just to stay hydrated so finding a foundation that looks like natural skin after 2hrs has been near impossible. A few BB creams on the market work but they lack the coverage I sometimes want for covering red areas around nose and chin. I wouldn't say this is hydrating and you could skin moisturizer but it's certainly not drying at all. This foundation is beautiful, looks natural like skin - it doesn't settle in pores and it doesn't get cakey. I apply using a wet BeautyBlender but have also used the Sigma F80 on days my skin is a wee more hydrated than usual. I was mixing it with tinted moisturizer at first but have been wearing Luminous Silk on its own and I am constantly having people ask how I have such an even complexion and they don't believe me when I say I have foundation on. They right there makes this a win!"

Because I have an oily tzone, I was scared that it wouldn't work out, but I feel like this foundation really gets better throughout the day. It doesn't look shiny or greasy, and I actually found that my semi oily skin gave it a nice dewy glow. This lasted for my 13 hour school to work day and I only had to minimally blot every 4-5 hours. It doesn't feel like I'm wearing a medium coverage foundation, and didn't look cakey when I built it up to cover the acne scarring on my cheeks. Overall, I'm super impressed with this foundation and if you have the money to splurge, DO IT.

It applies smoothly and feels weightless, provides good coverage, keeps my mildly oily t-zone in order with minimal morning powder, and has a beautiful satin finish that emanates health. It's not too oily or too tacky and sets to a natural feel relatively quickly—I find a flat foundation brush and short, quick strokes works perfectly over a liquid, brightening primer (tried another day with a mix of oil-based highlight and silicone hydrating primer with less luck). The shades can be difficult to match online (and the product difficult to locate outside of urban areas), so I recommend the shade match tool on the Armani site."

I was wary of the reviews that said the foundation would slide off and not last since it is so luminous but that was not the case for me.

			"review_text": "This foundation has been deemed holy grails by many people regardless of their skin type. I have dry skin and the promised radiant finish had me intrigued. After trying this foundation, it has amazing qualities that I love. But it's not the best foundation for me for a couple of reasons.  I wear Shade #4, which is light with golden undertones. This was the best colour match I could find from reviews and comparisons to other foundations I wear. #4 is a tad too light and not yellow enough for me, but it can still work with something mixed in. In the picture below, I mixed in Cover FX Custom Drops in G30 to warm it up. I'm about an NC20-25 for reference.  The finish of the foundation is supposed to be radiant and silky. I agree that it is silky, but not as radiant and luminous as I thought. The finish is not dewy, it's more of satin finish and matte in my dry areas (nose and cheeks). I was able to achieve my preferred dewy look with a hydrating primer and setting spray. But, what is strange is that the foundation gets really shiny throughout the day. I love when foundations turn dewy after it warms up on the skin, but this was too much for me in the short period I wore it. The foundation felt tacky after 4 hours, so expect to blot if you have oily skin.  Even though the foundation starts off with a satin finish, it doesn't emphasize any dry areas. My nose is always a problem area, and it didn't look gross after application. The product sits great on the skin, I won't deny that. After I blotted and powdered, it still looked great.  I think this foundation would be better suited for normal skin. If not, you'll have to maintain it throughout the day which might not be suitable for people. It's not my favourite foundation mostly because I don't have the best colour match, and the amount of maintenance I have to do when the foundation is $68 CAD is definitely a con. I do like the foundation, I just have a true holy grail foundation I prefer more."

			"review_text": "So i read and read through MANY reviews for months on this fab foundation and being that im not much of a matte chick,and all ab the dew/lumi look,you'd think i would have tired before i did..It wasn't even the price that stopped me,it was the review's that said not buildable or sheer,but medium buildable at most. I have freckles that i see most girls are faking now(???) but personally i don't like mine and it takes a high coverage or buildable foundation to cover SOO,my HG has been MUFEs HD stick foundation Y445(the stick i find more dewy than actual foundation) so after reviewing this and earning a badge on Influenster for the many girls asking me ab MUFE stick,someone pm'd me ab the Armani swearing id love it which got me here. Yes i know this is a long review but worth it-i ordered this baby and the SECOND i got it i went straight to put it on..id just ordered a new brush as well w no intentions on using with this so let me shorten up by saying i used with Sephora#47 foundation brush,Tartes Airbrush Bamboo foundation brush,fingertips AND a BB(i hate BBs) and it truly amazes me how much difference in coverage you CAN get just from choosing the right tool!!! If i had tried Armanis Lumi with JUST a BB or reg.brush(did NOT like covergae w BB and 47 did ok,js not as GREAT as the airbrush brush) i still would have given 5 stars so it wouldn't affect the actual foundation review, i hate when ppl do this bc its not always the foundation,sometimes its just using the right tool. In this/my case using with Tartes Airbrush Bamboo foundation brush gave me not only the dew,but a flawless face! The BB ate this bc it is sheer and soaked right up and although my 47 Sephora brush worked well too,my point is you gotta use this foundation with diff tools til you find what meets your goals but all in all Armani Luminous is definitely luminous,and although sheer,it absolutely CAN be as buildable as you'd like using the right tool.I also want to add for the many saying they wouldn't use for all day,my secret that has earned me a spot in a certain magazine (coming out October! yes im excited as i should be ;))is taking Bare Minerals original powder foundation and after Armani dries,take your powder brush,dip and tap off most then very lightly in circular motions add/buff onto the spots your worried about..works like a setting powder but won't take away that Armani Glow we buy this for..  I would suggest testing your color with a sample first before ordering simply bc i bought the #7 and it looks darker online than it came.im a Y445 in MUFE.(i never buy foundation online unless i know my color,that was my stupidity. LOL)..other than that if your looking for a subtle glow to a dewyER glow,w/o packing down your face with tons of product,you will love this and to those who ask if this gives that KimK glow? Yes it absolutely does give that glow,but not hers,embrace YOURS!!! Just remember,if your a BB girl and expecting more coverage,your better off with a brush sweetie! xXxXx"

I don't think it will cover up new acne or recent break out scars. It's very light weight, and covers up any redness or irritation you might have on your skin. However, in terms of coverage for pores, not as good as the Dior foundations.  This foundation does have a pleasant scent and it is really moisturizing. I wouldn't call this long lasting, so if you are planning to go out door in a hot summer day where you know you will sweat than this might not be such a good idea.

Prior to this, my favorite is MUFE, so if you like MUFE, I'd recommend testing this one out. I've brought this to CMs and the artists never had to use a boatload of pumps to cover my face, one and a half pumps was more than enough to cover my face using a brush. A beauty blender with this gives a great finish, BUT it might eat a little of the product. I use it with a beauty blender anyways. Highly recommend this!"

I use a moisturizer with SPF 100 and Giorgio Armani primer and it still doesn't become patchy, rather it lasts all day. I get sheer coverage and an even tone using a foundation brush & one pump. It's great for a natural, 'not wearing makeup look,' as my freckles show, but my skin tone becomes more even and healthier looking. I use a concealer in a few places. For more coverage, I use more foundation to hide the freckles, but I don't think it could ever be 'full coverage' makeup. In my opinion, it is not 'luminous,' drying, 'shiny' or moisturizing. I doubt it will completely hide every flaw, especially rosacea, without concealer. But if you like foundation that makes your skin look healthy and the color even, without shouting wearing makeup, this maybe for you. I guessed the color number the first time (4.5) because it was an online purchase. I wasn't sure I liked it, so I went to the store  and was told I needed 4.75. What a huge difference! If you aren't bowled over, you might have the wrong color. I mix a little Fluid Sheer with Luminous Silk foundation when I want a 'light from within' appearance."

I have combo skin and this sticks to my dry patches and sits on my skin weird, almost like it has a texture..which is odd for me because my skin is usually smooth and even in texture when bare. The shade is okay but I'm not blown away. Coverage is meh. It's more sheer to medium than I would like and no SPF living in Texas should have stopped me from buying it in the first place. I will absolutely be returning this and going back to my Rainforest of the Sea Water foundation with SPF 15."

I always heard others rave about this foundation, but I never purchased it before because (1) I have oily skin and the luminous name of it made me a little hesitant to buy it since I have oily skin. (2) the foundation is very expensive. I typically bought foundations within the $40-$50 price range, but I decided to splurge a little more for this foundation and give it a try. It has been the best decision I have made! The color range is amazing and it seriously looks like your own skin, you can't tell you are wearing foundation. The finish is luminous but it's so beautiful, as someone that has oily skin I've never tried a foundation that made my skin look radiant/healthy glow like this foundation. I do have acne-prone skin and ever since I used this foundation I have noticed that my skin texture has decreased and my skin is getting so much better! It also lasts a very long time and looks great! The coverage is a medium, but can definitely build up to full coverage. I just absolutely love this foundation and recommend it to others!! Yes, it may be expensive but trust me it is worth every single penny. I have never tried a foundation that I loved so much like this one! I will definitely be saving up to repurchase this again as it will be my go to foundation from now on. Please give it a try! I promise you won't be disappointed! Especially for my girls out there with oily skin that want a luminous look but don't want to look TOO oily this is perfect for you!"

I've never had a foundation do that to me. To confirm it was the foundation I tried it again the next day with a lighter moisturizer in advance and a more hydrating primer. I had the same exact thing happen. It was so bad that the skin around my nose and chin started to peel and I had irritation bumps all over my face. I'm just really baffled. I don't really want to knock the foundation too hard as I've seen the way it's supposed to look. My only thought is that the smaller bottles may not sell as quickly and maybe it was just an old bottle? Either way, I'm not saying don't purchase as I know it can be a lovely foundation, just test it out first if you have sensitive skin."

I suffered from pretty bad acne, and although most of my breakouts are gone, I have lots of redness left on my skin.

It literally has the exact finish of skin, not dewy or matte just radiant to where it looks like I have beautiful skin. I do use concealer on my hyperpigmentation to help coverage there because this definitely doesn't conceal them on its own.

I've been using it for about a year and a half now.   Before I found Luminous Silk, I had been bouncing around between Tarte and several other brands, and not feeling content with my foundation. I am very fair, with yellow undertones... so it's ridiculous difficult to find a company that makes a shade that matches well. Everything is either orange or pink for very fair tones. Nothing neutral or more yellow. On top of that, I am very very sensitive. I usually break out to anything other than the very natural brands... even then, they add oils or talc in their products that make me breakout. I am also combination/oily skin... but not too bad with the oil.   My cousins all wear Luminous Silk, and bought me a bottle in shade 2 for a bday gift, swearing that it would work for me... since they have very similar skin.   First, it matched perfectly... like it disappeared into my skin. (Halle-freaking-lujah)  Second, it was the perfect coverage... looked like medium coverage (I have freckles and still like them, I like coverage, just not so much that they totally disappear), and it was very natural looking. People were thinking I didn't have any on, but my skin looked much more even. Third, it had such a lovely texture. Doesn't melt off, doesn't settle into fine lines or creases, and it has a mild Luminous touch to it, hence the name.  I do wear primer and set it with a delicate powder after.  Fourth, I have never broken out from wearing it. I can tell it has higher-quality ingredients in it, because my sensitive skin has no issues with it.  I will continue to keep ordering Luminous Silk, despite the higher ticket price. For my skin and makeup desires, it's perfect. Not sure anything can top this product. I hope they never change or re-formulate it."

I use becca matte primer and i dont know if that is why or not but it seems to kind of just sit on top of my face instead of blending into my skin.  The formula is a little more watery than i expected it to be especially for something with so much coverage.  Not a complaint, just an observation.  I did deduct one star just because as another review stated it does oxidize after a couple hours.  I have the 5.5 and it matches my skin perfectly when i put it on but gets a little dark and just.. off colored, and doesn't match as well.  It isn't a big enough deal that i felt the need to return and get a shade lighter (plus summer is almost upon us so chances are my face will tan up a little anyway) but if i needed to reorder again i would probably go with a shade lighter.

I give it five stars because it is what it says it is, a lightweight, high end foundation that leaves a flawless finish.   It's definitely shear coverage at the start, but you can build it to medium.  I use concealer underneath to get to full coverage.  This foundation has a way of gliding over things like acne and scars, but if you have dry patches, you will need a very smoothing primer because it does tend to highlight those.    It doesn't settle into lines and lasts pretty much all day with minimal touch up.  Even if you get oily, this foundation has a way of looking good no matter what.   Worth the money and definitely a good choice for a special occasion."

First of all my skin type is combination/oily and this foundation looks good ALLLL day, literally no hesitation, Second my skin is very acne-prone and this covers my blemishes nicely, by that I mean, even if you have an active or healing blemish this foundation just glides right over it no patchiness or flakes. Oh and the coverage is amazing it's not super full coverage but it is a true medium to buildable full coverage, and let me just say its impossible for this foundation to look cakey so fear not. I love that you can use it with a brush or a beauty blender and it'll be flawless either way. The best part to me is the finish... the finish is just so beautiful. It is not dewy at all it just looks like healthy skin, truly a your skin but WAY better finish. I really can't say enough good things about this foundation all that is left to say is dont be skeptical. If you want a high end foundation this is it. It WILL always be my holy grail foundation it is well worth every penny. Last point I have to make If you're someone who has an oily skin type please don't worry this is one of the rare foundations that actually works on dry skin, combination skin, and oily skin. You. Will. Love. It. One of the best makeup purchases I've ever bought and I am on my 3rd bottle and don't worry each bottle lasts about 8 months to a year for me that's because I reserve this foundation only for special occasions such as date nights. birthdays, New Years etc. etc. So clearly I've been using this foundation for years, I'm only writing a review now because I'm about to buy the Giorgio Armani Luminous Silk powder and thought I may as well let everyone know how much of a great buy this foundation is. I know this review was long but I hope if nothing else it was helpful!"

I did not realize this until I underwent research on the skin problems I was facing, the dermatologists and medical spas I waa going to. The real change I needed was with the foundation I was using.   This Georgio Armani foundation has truly been a positive change in my regimen. Without any exaggeration, it has also improved my mental outlook because it has helped me get my skin (with and without makeup) looking amazing. Firstly, the formulation is immaculate (and ladies you do not need a thick formula to give you coverage). It features this incredible blurring technology and luminescence.  The consistency of the foundation is on the thinner side and only requires a small amount of application. The research done on colour matching by the GO team has been amazing and it is literally like a second skin without stickiness, without feeling like you're truly wearing coverage.  My skin actally glows more throughout the day. Who would have that a foundation can do this?   My skin has improved each day with a regular routine of using high quality products.  I feel confident, my skin is clear, I am happy and Georgio Armani has gained a huge advocate for this product.    I am officially obsessed!"

I honestly didn't expect to like this because I REALLY dislike the Loreal Lumi foundation as it just sits on my skin. But I had to try this because shade 6 is one of the few true olive shades on the market. The only downside to this foundation is that it wears off after about 4-5 hours for me. If I set it with a powder then maybe it would last longer, but powders tend to make my face look pink for some reason so I really avoid them.  I know there are a lot of great foundations for people that are less expensive, but seriously no foundations are really very olive. So if you're like me and really need that green undertone then I recommend investing in this guy."

Normally I hate this type of finish, I am all about dewy and glowy finish because of my dry skin. In addition foundations need to cover rosacea and blend with multiple freckles on my fair skin. This foundation addresses all these problems, blends with my fair neck, builds up over my rosacea and blends with my freckles without making them appear gray! For ladies with dry skin: It is semi mate yet not drying, which often has been my experience with that type of finish. Generally I cannot pull off anything other than dewy/shiny finish for more than two hours even with lots of skin prepping. At the end of the day (even up to 13-14 hours) my tiny wrinkles are not emphasized, and my face does not looks like a dry paper. Granted LSF wears of somewhat, but I still have remnants of the foundation when I clean my face at night. I would describe the coverage as medium at application to light at the end of the day. It is buildable, great plus as my rosacea is worse on the left side of my face.  Applied best with sponge."

But a good primer is necessary with this product or its impact will not be felt. I saw the huge difference with and without a primer. Without a primer the foundation feels like it's eaten up by the skin. I had to apply so much more to see any coverage. Once I applied smashbox's primer, I used a lot less foundation and it spread on smoothly with my fingers.   This foundation is high quality but it is very expensive. If budget is not an issue I would recommend it. Otherwise I would go with Toofaced foundation (thicker coverage) or Makeup Forever HD (heavier coverage too but not as thick as Toofaced)."

If my skin is pretty balanced to dry, this foundation looks great on me with little to no effort. I like how quickly I can apply it and not get streaks or uneven coverage. It's lightweight, non-irritating to my sensitive skin, and the scent is mild but pretty. I end up with a not perfect complexion, but very pretty and soft.   However, if I don't make sure my moisturizer is COMPLETELY absorbed into my skin, or if I use a heavier moisturizer for my winter dry skin, this slides all around my face, sinks into every pore and crease, and actually turns LIGHTER than my skin tone. It actually turns lighter and more grayish pink than my neck, which is bizarre, since I have mild rosacea, and my face is always red and blotchy while my neck is a pale yellow and pink. It also does not seem to give me a medium coverage unless I apply two layers.   I'm truly on the fence regarding the product. I feel like it is a bit tricky to use in terms of hey, is it going to look amazing today because my skin is dry enough, or is it going to look horrendous because my skin was too dry and I needed to moisturize heavily. Considering it also seems a bit drying, I don't know that it makes a good winter foundation, which is what I am looking for, but can I wear it in the spring knowing I may be sweating at times? Seems like a pricey gamble, but I'm tempted to take it because the finish IS so pretty.   Finally, getting a perfect match can be tricky. The numbers for the colors are all wacky, with five being my match (I usually am at about a 3 in the winter), and I was matched with a neutral undertone, which usually turns me gray. I noticed if I apply one layer, this match is perfect, but two layers DO turn me gray. My impression after a week of use is that I'd like to purchase it, but only after I find a better all purpose, every day foundation for winter."

I get oily no matter what products I use but of all the dewy foundations I've used, this gives me the best wear throughout the day. It looks like skin and it doesn't break me out. I am extremely acne prone so that's essential.   I use shade 9 in summer and mix shade 8 (too light) with custom cover drops (N70) in winter. Love it! I prefer this formula to literally every other foundation I've tried because it makes my skin look so good and not too makeup-y. The coverage is sheer to medium. I don't find it very buildable past that but I don't mind, that's what concealer is for. (nars tahoe/cadiz; mac nc44/45)"

I have combination skin, a little bit more on the oily side I guess. This foundation not only feels soooo smooth going on it actually makes my face softer and I feel I'm not wearing nothing on my face. I was scared to try it because I heard if u have oily skin it doesn't look good but no they are wrong. My face looked beautiful all day and night and I even had men compliment my skin on my face that has never happened to me before. And this foundation stays on forever  anyways if u have been debating whether or not to get this, DO IT ITS WORTH THE MONEY <3"

And since then, I've been on the search for a full coverage foundation/cc cream   concealer that didn't make me look and feel like a walking cake. I've tried it all. To get a good amount of coverage, I've had to sacrifice a significant amount of time, foundation, and a natural look--- so my acne scars would disappear but the trade-off was that my face would be cakey and by the end of the day, thick and oily. I didn't really believe the hype when I heard about this foundation. But it does do what it claims to do. When I wore  this foundation out for the first time, I received so many compliments on how much better my skin looked and how much it's improved. My face was dewy, (seemingly) clear, and light--- as opposed to my usual oily then dry then back to oily, (kind of) clear, cakey skin. It's expensive for foundation, but it's worth it because you don't even need to put on so much. If I had to pick a downside to this foundation, it'd be that it enhances the fine lines underneath my eyes when I smile. That and also, I can't seem to find the perfect color yet. I currently wear 5.75, but I'm looking for something more yellow toned. Suggestions would be appreciated!"

It offers great coverage from medium-sheer to medium-full, and a single layer can be built upon without a cakey or unnatural finish. When wearing it, it's undetectable and produces the look of radiant skin free of imperfections. While there is a reasonable volume of foundation in a single bottle, the Luminous Silk foundation still has a high price point. I find that while it doesn't aggravate any skin issues, it doesn't improve the underlying quality of my skin per se. Still on the fence as to whether or not I wish to use this on a daily basis, given this fact and the price point. However, if you want a quality foundation, this product certainly lives up to the acclaim behind the Armani Beauty name.  Compared to the Maestro foundation, I would 9/10 times recommend one goes with this formulation. While initially considering Maestro, I found that this product offers a buildable coverage that the Maestro line lacks (i.e. is more versatile). Unless you are specifically looking for a tinted moisturizer effect and nothing more, Luminous Silk is the best option in the Armani foundation range.  Note that, for porcelain/fair skin tones, the '3' shade is in fact lighter than '2.' 2 has a bit of an unfortunate orange cast, and for the fairest of skin, I would recommend that you purchase the 3 instead."

A minor con is that It's not very long-wearing because it was easily rubbed off when I blew my nose. However, it did stay on the rest of my face. I like how there is an expiration date on the bottom.  I highly recommend this foundation IF you have the money to splurge but I would not recommend it if you have oily skin.

I use a brush as the beauty blender sponge tends to suck up the product. I use this with the Hourglass primer and it goes well together. The foundation lasted all day... amazing.

Secondly, when you put this foundation on, it actually looks like your own SKIN but a photoshopped airbrushed version of it (in a good way). It just smooths over and melts into the skin flawlessly. The ONLY complaint I have, is that I do get oily after a couple of hours of wear and need to blot, (but that's with every foundation I wear. I never prime either, as it creates a barrier between skin and product). You do have to set this foundation with a powder, or it will come off. It does transfer SLIGHTLY.

The product is very silky and easy to blend with a sponge, brush, or your fingers, but I always use the sponge. It can be allowed to settle, and added to for a fuller coverage, and it builds beautifully. I follow this up with a creamy concealer and usually set the whole face with powder, as I do with every foundation, and it lasts for most of the day.

If you've got pretty great skin but want to take it to a next-level silkiness and glow, then this is for you. My skin isn't like that, though! I have a lot of pigmentation (post-inflammation, sun damage, plus melasma), but I still like it because it gives me something between au naturel and full-on, I'm-definitely-wearing-foundation makeup (for that I rely on Makeup Forever's HD Invisible Cover foundation). You can still see my spots underneath, but they're lighter and I love the finish of this foundation: lightweight, luminous, and natural.

It feels great on the skin, not sticky or tacky, and just melts into your skin and looks radiant.  I don’t know what magic they put in this but I’m a customer for life.

I'm light skinned warm tone and I used number 4 which was not the perfect match at all, way too orange but the only one that was close from the light shades. As for dry skin it was fine it didn't create the tightening feeling and that the reason why I bought it mostly because my skin was suffering from dryness. Now coverage, I would say light medium side and building up for my skin it made me  more orange in those areas applied or would crease badly and the other thing I hated was how it would show pores on my nose and yes I did use a primer. The only reason I gave two stars its because of texture I loved how smooth it felt when you put it on your face and easy to apply it, very pleasing and I liked the light smell to it. I also hoped it had glow to it like a beautiful dewy glow. It feels like it should since it says silky but no glow anywhere in my face.

Anyone remember that crying kimoji tweet where Kim kardashian freaked out by the news that this foundation would be discontinued, this gives a nice coverage, especially in my T zone area. It does not cover my acne scars but I have darker pigmentation than most. I remember trying this when I was younger when I acneic oily skin. I didn't like it as much (and I used maybe a bottle or two?) and continued searching for foundation. Now that I am older and have become drier/combo T zone I like this a lot. Even my derm loves this foundation.   But the con of this besides it not being able to cover scars? The color matching- I can not make sense of the numbering. I am darker than Kim K and I liked 5.5. She mixes 7 and 9... a youtuber that I normally wear the same foundation color as was too pink on me... The 6.25. Another blogger likes the 7.5.... From what I've seen, if you want a bit of pink, go for a number that has .25. If you are like me and are olive/yellow tone, stick with a .5 number. I will try the 6.5 to see if that matches me better. If you want something a tad more luminous try the new ysl foundation."

Amore Pacific CC compact also not my cup of tea.  After Giorgio Armani: This is the best foundation ever! I don't feel like wearing makeup at all! You can still see some of my hormonal pimples on my forehead ( I used NARS creamy concealer to cover them) but other than that IT LOOKS REALLY NATURAL AND SKIN-LIKE. Exactly what I'm looking in foundation. Now I know why I avoid wearing foundation for almost one and a half year, it is because those foundations that I used have a very thick consistency and they masked my skin couldn't breathe and I can't wait to wipe my face off! I got mine in the shade 6. Not all people will love this foundation but for those who love natural/minimal makeup would definitely love this.

I have tried and finished bottles of foundation from many different companies, and Giorgio Armani's Luminous Silk foundation is the first (and hopefully last) foundation that has ever broken me out. I am prone to getting pimples, so the first FOUR TIMES I got pimples from switching to this new foundation, I blamed it on my skin/hormones. Eventually, I realized during the weeks I go without foundation, I have next to zero pimples, and the day immediately after me wearing the foundation, as if there were some timer, a new pimple pops up without fail. It barely covers any of my pimples, unless I layer it on 3 times -- by then it would look horrible and cakey. It does not control oiliness, and in fact exacerbate it. I'd have it on for maximum 3 hours, my forehead and nose starts getting extremely shiny -- EVEN WITH MATTIFYING POWDER. Too bad I missed the 30 day period window because I waited too long to try this on, or else I would have returned it in a heartbeat. It exacerbates break outs, oiliness, and does not cover pimples, only adds more texture."

I also have a hard time finding a good shade for my medium, yellow golden skintone (hard to explain). I find myself needing to exfoliate more to get rid of flaky dry skin and I wear lots of moisturizer. I bought this foundation in number 6. When I swatched this on my face and neck it literally disappeared it was a perfect match. I wore this with a little bit of primer just on my T Zone and it looks and sits so beautiful on my skin. I didn't even set it just to truly test it and it did not crease or ball up with my dry skin, it also gives me a healthy glow and does not feel like I am wearing anything. The coverage is sheer to medium which is perfect for me since I've never had acne and I just have very little redness around my nose. I can see how this foundation is not for everyone but it works wonders with dry skin. In my opinion this foundation is worth every dollar and I only have to use very little to get perfect skin blending with my beautyblender. If you have dry skin ask for a sample, you will love this!"

Not to say that I use drugstore makeup (on my face) or anything, because I have learned from experience that you get what you pay for, but the $62 price tag on this was really hard for me to swallow. I only decided to try it out (they don't have this in my local Sephora for me to get a sample) because I had the 15% off coupon and I figured that would be the best time to give in and splurge just to see what everyone was raving about. Well now I'm hooked. See, I had been using the Clinique Beyond Perfecting foundation and I was in love with it. It lasted all day and controlled my oil which was the only foundation I could find that would do that AND was affordable. I had tried this and really liked it, but I thought the Clinique foundation was the answer because of its price. Then my face started to break out horribly and I couldn't figure out why. I tried switching up my skincare, changing my daily routine, nothing worked. Then I remembered around the time that my issues started was after I'd been using the Clinique for a few days. I decided to try wearing this very expensive Luminous Silk foundation for a week, going back to my normal skincare routine, as well. Low and behold, after about three days my acne slowly started to diminish. This Giorgio Armani wears beautifully and it lasts ALL DAY. My oil does not come through, and my skin responds well to it - no breakouts or irritation. I do set it with Laura Mercier translucent powder. I put my foundation on at around 6:30 in the morning and by about 6:00 in the evening, it still looks great, with ZERO touch ups throughout the day. I'm sorry for the lengthy review, ladies, but if you're on the fence about this one because of the price, it is worth every penny. Buy it!"

Also very hard to layer if you want to build more coverage.  I tried it with a couple of different primers and none really changed my opinion.   For the record, my skin is fairly dry and I was looking for something lightweight with a luminous finish.  It is lightweight, but not in a good way, as it didn't really melt into my skin the way a good foundation does."

It's thin and light weight, yet the coverage is perfect for someone who doesn't have major blemishes. My skin is combination leaning toward oily, but Armani foundations (both Luminous Silk and Maestro) have never given me any pimples or skin clogging. Just wonderful. My skin does get a bit oily toward the later half of the day, but my foundation looks flawless again as soon as I dab the excess oil away. So the stuff is pretty long lasting. Depends on the moisturizer I use underneath, the finish ranges from matte to a semi-matte with a subtle sheen, which is very healthy looking. My makeup always applies so easily on top of this. The foundation infuses so well with the skin that it is not really detectable, and it never cakes up. Great product and super worthy. HOWEVER, IF YOU ARE PREGNANT: Unfortunately this product contains both methylparaben and butylparaben. UGH!!! Why? Methylparaben is not that huge of a problem, but butylparaben might increase the chance of birth defects :( I'm extremely disappointed to find out about the ingredients because now I have to stay away from this wonderful product until the baby is born. I would so have given this foundation a 10 stars otherwise. But it is just NOT COOL for such a high end product to contain potentially harmful substance :("

I know a lot of commenters mentioned the lighter coverage and I would have to disagree. Foundation should enhance not cover entirely, and you can always place some corrector/concealer over the spots that need it while using this product.

I heard this was the 'gold standard' of foundations and thought I'd try it. Time to get 'serious about skincare' and all that. I've always had oily skin but not acne prone so using moisturizers was detrimental as well as acne or oil control products. If you can be oily-normal, that was me. Now I'm beginning to dry up a little via age so I've hit 'Combination' skin. Back to my review: Long story short, It's the gold standard. I used Sephora's color IQ business ONLINE and punched in my previous brand's foundation and concealer colors and received my number of 1R07, showing me my Geo Armani luminous silk foundation color match of 5.25 --- I hit go, got it, and yep, it was a perfect match to my skin color. No mall trip, no people, two thumbs up. Held up to to my dry AND oily areas, zero product 'feel' on my face, and held up well after 8 hours, not perfect, but better than any other foundation I've ever used. Underneath i had Lancome Genifique and a daily moisturizer w/ SPF 20.

Once you figure out your shade, though, this is an amazing light/mid-weight foundation. Lasts all day, looks totally natural, and doesn't feel heavy or clog pores at all. A bottle lasts forever -- I use mine 5 days a week and have been going strong for more than 6 month, with still more left to go. Highly recommend!"

It was a dream to apply and wear on my super dry skin. My search for the perfect foundation was over. I immediately ordered the full size product but what I received was Disappointment. The full size product's formula is much thinner than the sample and offers light coverage at best. Had the product matched the sample I would have rated this foundation 5 stars instead of 3. Even so, Armani Luminous Silk Foundation deserves high praise for the right skin type, perhaps normal to slightly dry. It absolutely applies like silk and on a less than very dry skin, I'm certain it will give the radiant look we gals crave. But, fair warning....the end result is light coverage. Yes, the foundation is buildable but if you need medium coverage, the amount of product needed to achieve that look is cost prohibitive for most."

While she was right, that it is buildable, I feel like I have to use half the bottle to get any coverage. I was having to use it sparingly because if I used it everyday I would've run out way to soon and I'm not about to spend 62 dollars on foundation constantly! I have oily skin and some invented texture on my forehead so I think this foundation is better for people with really great skin."

I have dry skin, although my nose can get a little shiny (not oily) at the end of every day. I use the Nivea shave balm as my primer with my MUFE correcting primer for redness, I apply the foundation and set with MAC mineralize skin finish powder. PERFECTION!!!!!!"

I know its not a full coverage foundation but to even apply it takes me about 3-4 pumps just to cover my face, and that doesn't hide any imperfections. It also creases pretty easily and doesn't smell that great (I know thats not what I'm paying for but it smells chemically and I don't like it) Also, half way through the day even after using setting spray it was starting to settle in lines and rub off.   The only positives I have about this are that it was not too oily and I am really happy with the shade- it matches really nicely to my skin without turning orange through the day.  Overall- not worth the money in my opinion."
