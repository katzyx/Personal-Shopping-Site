I know some have said that when they bought rollers of different stones or sizes, that they've received one with chips in it, or poor quality metal that breaks. I recommend going with this one for the couple extra $$. It's beautiful, doesn't have one chip in it, nice and smooth, rolls easily but not too loose, without and squeaking or noise that would denote cheap quality, and the metal part is very sturdy! Its VERY well crafted! I don't see myself needing to replace this one for a long time. Plus, it comes with a 1 yr warranty! I'm glad I didn't buy a cheaper one to save a couple bucks. This one is beautiful!"

I like to use it on a clean face, immediately following cleansing with no additional product on. They recommend to use with an oil or serum to assist with glide of the roller, but I find that it works fine without an aid too. My only complaint is the roller has more cracks/scratches in the stone that I am used to. My rose quartz roller arrived with no issue, but this amethyst one had several cracks and scratches in it. That could be because this product is made by hand. Mount Lai makes all their rollers from hand and warn of imperfections, so maybe my roller is just showing natural imperfections? Or maybe the stone is harder to cut than jade and rose quartz? Not sure. In any case, the product still rolls nicely on the skin. I don't feel the grooves or knicks/cuts as it slides and rolls on my face. I do feel this helps with de-puffing my eyes too. An unexpected side effect is that it just makes me feel calm as I use it. It is a nice tool to distress yourself in the evening. I recommend buying it."

I use it with a facial oil at night, large side on cheeks, neck, and forehead, small side under eyes and on chin.  I chose amethyst because its my birth stone, and I charged it under a full moon (if you're into that you can definitely feel its energy) before I started using it and recharge once a month."

I find it easy to use, light and really does help with facial tension and puffiness. I wouldn't expect it to do any miracles , but it is a nice little luxury to help with facial tension/puffiness.  I opted for the full size as I agree with other reviews -it is nice to have the larger roller-the mini side is really for just under the eye area."

It's sturdy so I'm not worried about breaking it, comes in a lovely little case, and feels so luxurious. I use mine either between serums or after I've applied them all (typically 3-4) and, even if I use it between each serum, the roller stays quite cool. I love that it's little because I can really get around my nose and undereyes. I love how this helps my serums skin into my skin.

If you are hoping for the full experience I would opt for a full size roller as it is a little small (and I am considered petite). Absolutely beautiful though--love the amethyst!"

I  was looking at the same item (different company) on another beauty company website and it was $70! So I thought Id order from Sephora. Im so glad I did! Its not cheap feeling at all. It comes in a cute satin-lined storage box, rolls smoothly and Im not concerned about breaking it even if I apply pressure. The main purpose of me buying this was not to smooth out my skin, but to help relieve some sinus pressure from my severe allergies. I just got the roller so Ill have to report back after I use it for a while."

Great for relieving stress and relaxing face muscles. If you chill it, it feels sooo refreshing on your face. I love using it on my under eyes; it helps the area feel more firm and make the bag line less prominent (or at least it feels like it does)! Also it's a great activity to do on the side to rid mental stress (who needs a fidget spinner)."

At first, she was a little bit suspicious about this jade roller and worried if it was worth the money. But now, we both believe it is worth a try! tbh It's not gonna magically change your face and your skin instantly, but as long as you try it consistently, you will see a difference for sure."

When I saw this amethyst one I was immediately drawn to it. Yes its a little more pricey then the jade or rose quartz and it does the same thing that they do (so if you want to save 10-15 get one of them). Its super pretty and feels really cool on the skin. Its a great step to add of your really into skincare as it helps get products deeper into the skin. This is easy to use and feels super relaxing"
