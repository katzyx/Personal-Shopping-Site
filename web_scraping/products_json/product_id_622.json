The powder gel formula, created with a high pearl concentration, has a luminous glow subtle enough to look natural - you wonu2019t find micro-glitter here - yet, the wearer appears lit from within. The smooth, buildable formula doesnu2019t enhance or create texture; it applies evenly and quite naturally.  The packaging is true to the Gucci branding and luxury status. Though itu2019s priced higher than other highlighters, in this case, the cost is truly reflective of the quality. A little goes a long way."

            "review_text": "I received this product for free in exchange for review, and I think it might be my favorite highlighter that hasnu2019t been discontinued, but Iu2019m somewhat surprised to say that because Iu2019d passed over purchasing it after seeing reviews (which were good, but not consistent with what I look for so I think this has a lot of versatility).   Personally when I use highlight I want everything to look like my skin rather than stand out as makeup. To achieve this result, given that I have light-medium skin with a very pink undertone, I look for a light/medium depth with a pink/peach color, no noticeable shimmer and low opacity. Originally looking at this product the color and lack of shimmer looked on point, but I thought it might be a bit too deep (looked medium+) and I questioned the opacity for personal use since many reviewers who want a u201chighlighter you can see from spaceu201d were singing its praise. Upon use I found that color-wise shade 04 was great for what Iu2019m looking for, similar Doll Dynasty from Hindash (which is a bit lighter on both sides of the shift) or Pat McGrathu2019s Divine Rose in pink packaging (though the Gucci leans a bit more reddish bronze than pink on the non-gold end of the shift). The depth was in fact a medium, maybe medium+ by my estimate, but I didnu2019t see an off shift with light use on my skin. When it comes to opacity, where I feel this really shines, you have the ability to apply the product very naturally with a light hand or build it up for a high opacity look. There are also no noticeable sparkle particles in the formula, though you can make it very metallic with a high-opacity application. Lastly thereu2019s no noticeable scent I could pick up from application and the compact feels very solid.  I think the Chanelu2019s discontinued Reve de Camelia is still my personal favorite, but only because itu2019s so light on the skin (with none of Gucciu2019s versatility to build up shine/opacity). That said, of currently available formulas, Iu2019d pick and recommend Gucci."

I received shade u201cOpal Pink 04u201d and itu2019s a very pretty color that could work for light-medium skin tones.   Overall the formula is great, it feels very buttery and works well with other products (cream + powder products) that I use. It has a natural yet flattering finish - this is not an overpowering, blinding highlighter and it does not accentuate your imperfections. This is almost a better version of what the Becca highlighters were back in the day.   I usually apply this after applying my cream blush, and spraying my face with some Mac Fix+.  I love this for the days when Iu2019m not going for a full beat but still want my skin to have a healthy glow - Iu2019m obsessed to say the least, and already bought 2 more shades!!"

It will accentuate exactly what you need but everyone who has ever used a highlighter will question if you have a highlighter on or if your skin is simply that beautiful and you are standing on the perfect place where the light is shining right on the top of your cheeks or collarbones. It is very finely milled and feels silky. Stays on as long as you need. The packaging looks gorgeous and will be beautiful later on only as a mirror. I have the color 01 Sunrise gold. I think the name is slightly misleading because the highlighter is definitely more pink than gold (although you can get pink sunrises).

Comparing just the packaging of this highlighter next to my Dior highlighter, I would have assumed this one to be less than half the price of Dior, but it actually costs more. I collect tons of Dior, Chanel, Tom Ford and a little Hermes beauty so I was really excited to try my first Gucci beauty product but I am definitely disappointed. Based on this experience I donu2019t think Iu2019ll try any more of their products - at least not without seeing the quality in person first."

The packaging is luxurious and sleek, reflecting the high-end nature of the brand. The formula is finely milled, which allows it to blend seamlessly onto the skin without emphasizing texture.  The glow it provides is luminous and natural, perfect for achieving that lit-from-within look. Itu2019s buildable, so you can go for a subtle sheen or a more intense highlight depending on the occasion. I also appreciate the shade range, which caters to a variety of skin tones.  The only reason Iu2019m giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is the price. While the quality is undeniable, itu2019s definitely an investment piece. Additionally, I found that it fades slightly after a few hours, so touch-ups may be necessary for longer wear.  Overall, itu2019s a beautiful product that delivers a sophisticated glow. If you're willing to splurge, this highlighter is worth adding to your collection."

I have freckles and I want to show them as much as possible so I skip foundation very often. For my needs, this highlighter works wonderfully as it is subtle and very natural. I choose the number 3, which is a warm highlighter, as it seemed the most appropriate for my skin tone. The pictures have no filter and the only makeup I am wearing is mascara and this highlighter, so I hope you can see clearly how this shade looks on my skin tone. I only used it lightly but it is not very pigmented, which I like but might be a problem for those who are looking for something more dramatic. That said, it is buildable. The packaging is cute and light so it wonu2019t make your makeup bag heavy either."

While the compact looks cute, it feels very cheap in your hands and does not live up to the luxury you would expect based on the Gucci label or the price point. And the highlighter itself is more like frosted eyeshadow in my opinion. Itu2019s less shimmer and more glitter, so instead of a nice glowy highlight you get a sparkle that looks textured all on its own.

It may be what it is in the formula, that allows us to get such a subtle natural glow , you get from a freshly cleaned face. So trust the process with this formula.

When I opened it up, I was greeted by the GUCCI sparkling in the Highlighter that just carried that high end feel.   The texture of the powder was ethereal and light both on your fingers and on your face. But it definitely gave that definition in all the right places, especially the cheekbones. It definitely elevated my makeup game.   The only downside is it felt like I really had to put on for it to shimmer the way I wanted to, but it just depends on your skin."

I finally gave up and ordered the highlighter online to have it shipped waited some more and after finally receiving it today all my hopes let down yet again as my highlighter arrived damaged   It looks like its melting out of the pan and the compact itself looks tempered with as it had finger prints all over it .

As someone who's dangerously close to checking the 55 & up category box, I'm looking for smooth, glowy and incandescent in a highlighter, and I don't want glitter, sparkle or anything that is going to accentuate the texture that comes with skin that has matured untouched by the needle or scalpel. Gucci has created a magical highlighter that does just that for me. I chose the Opal Pink shade as it looked most flattering for my fair skin and it is neutral enough to go with almost any other makeup I'm wearing (i.e. it's not that pink, more a smokey rosy pink that looks like an extension of a natural blush if that makes sense). I absolutely love this stuff! It smooths out my skin, gives my cheekbones a lift and adds a credible but glamorous light to my skin. Prior to buying the Gucci, my favorite highlighter was Pat McGrath in the platinum shade. It also has all the incredible attributes of lifting, smoothing and accentuating BUT it broke during shipping every time I purchased it, which was very disheartening and just a hassle to deal with. Plus this shade from Gucci is something Mother Pat would never (or at least hasn't thus far, and her most creative era seems sadly behind her if the PML releases of late are any indicator). The compact is gorgeous too, a dreamy pink and gold handful of luxury. So, would I repurchase? Oh my yes. I don't think I'm going to need to as I see this one compact lasting me a very long time, but yes, I'd buy again even at full price (bought during the savings event). Worth every penny to me!"

I hated the color when I saw it, but it's actually pretty subtle on your skin (unless you pack it on) and adds a nice touch to your makeup. It's a combo of lilac/pink and suitable for my pale skin. It has zero smell and doesn't have any fall out in the compact or on your face. I still think I'd prefer a different color though."

I like this texture because itu2019s not crumbled not from brush or from fingers due the applying but lies on the skin very evenly. My experience. This highlighter doesnu2019t work equally well for all my face parts, because I have sensitive and combined skin and on the dry parts (under the eyebrow or on my eyelid) it lies and looks perfect. But for my cheekbone it doesnu2019t work well, unfortunately. Because oily skin on this part of my face absorbs radiance very quickly no matter how much amount of highlighter I applied.

Have you ever had a component so difficult to open that you accidentally dig your nail into trying to pry the packaging open? I have, and not just with one component either. That is wear the luxury beauty aspect comes in, Gucci thought this through. The lip to open this product is the best I've ever tried by far, and Ive tried ALL the top cosmetics lines, and have never fallen in love such a specific thing on a product, but seriously the lip to open this makes it so easy. I have family with limited ability to use there hands (arthritis, and hand trembles among others)  and when I showed them this I was so happy that they each went and bought a color of their own choosing due to how much they absolutely love the component, it's worth it trust me!!!  As for the actual product inside, it was very subpar. It was marketed as a gel powder hybrid but it just fell flat on so many different levels. It did not give up any kind of beautiful shine, just bland metallic blotchy patchy mediocrity. Just absolutely disappointed me as I love a lot from the Gucci brand and have yet to come up across a product that I didn't absolutely love. So not even liking or enjoying this product inside was quite a shock to me as they are one of my favorite brands. Not worth the price, I think this needs to be reformulated. Please swatch before buying."

At this point, my face had been wearing makeup all day, and when I got home and received the gift from Influenster, I opened it immediately to try it outu2014I just couldnu2019t wait. Since it was 11 p.m., the lighting in my room wasn't ideal, so whatever you see in the video, you should multiply it by three to get an accurate idea. It reflects light beautifully and adheres well without needing much powder. In summary, this product is totally worth it. I love it so much and will repurchase when I run out. For those of you with fair Asian skin, I think warm gold is the perfect shade."

The texture is buttery and smooth and picks up and applies with no effort.  The Gucci liquid highlighter is so much more subtle and elegant and luxuriously packaged (though still a bit warm-toned in the only shade).  I don't know why that never got much interest, but it's the one I'd pick over this.  This compact also feels light and flimsy, not at all in keeping with other items in the line.

I appreciate that it's not overly purple or pastel, making it a versatile option for various makeup looks. The highlighter stays in place well throughout the day, without fading or transferring. The packaging is luxurious and sturdy, with a convenient mirror for on-the-go touch-ups. If you're looking for a high-quality highlighter that delivers a subtle, shimmery glow, the Gucci Lilac Glow Highlighter is definitely worth considering."

Iu2019m just gonna say itu2019s okay. Itu2019s very sheer, the color is supposed be sunrise gold so i was expecting a warm gold, but it is very much pink. I donu2019t seeing it being very blend-able because itu2019s almost translucent with a shine of pink. The packaging is very cute, no scent, the texture is nice. But the quality for being a Gucci product is unfortunately not what I expected. And I was super stoked to get to try this. Iu2019ll continue to try it a few more time to see if I like it but so far 6 out of 10. Now looking at photos of all the options  I def wanted to get warm glow. The packaging is super cute, and the little mirror makes it nice as well."

I chose the shade 03 Warm gold because my skin is medium with warm undertone and I think gold highlighters are the best for me. Indeed this shade is perfect for my skin tone. The formula is very silky and is long lasting. I like the natural look and not super bold highlighter so I think this is a product I highly recommend."

The consistency of the formula feels like you're not wearing anything at all, and it's like impossible to put too much on. It doesn't cake, it doesn't clump, and it looks very, very natural. It is a very subtle highlight and definitely buildable. I feel like this is a product that will last a long time, and it doesn't have any kind of smell to it or anything. I have pretty oily skin. The problem I often have with highlighters is that it makes my skin look shiny or oily. This doesn't give me any kind of a shiny look to face just a natural Glow.  I definitely recommend this. It's hard to find beauty products that are original or unlike anything else and it is definitely a new kind of product."

The color itself is nice but I had a bronze color which I felt was too dark dark for me.   It applied into my skin nicely and it was just ok. Not something i'd probably do for everyday wearing, maybe if I was going to an event.  Now, the thing I didn't like..... the packaging. As you can see in my pics, the product was all broken and stuck to each side of the palette. There is nothing that is covering the product to keep this from happening and this is why I only gave it 4 stars.

Sometimes I open the case just so I can shut it again. The snap that it produces is sooo satisfying!! Apropos of the highlighter, I received mine in the shade sunrise gold. She's this rlly pretty pearly white w the most beautiful opalescent lilac shift when swatched. Nothing at all like the gold that the name suggests lol. I wish my camera was able to better pick up the purples in this shade cuz she's rlly not as rosy or metallic as she looks here either. It does not do the colors in this enough justice imho. For the best payoff I strongly recommend applying the highlighter w ur fingers instead of w a brush. Mb it's bc of the powder gel formula but for whatever reason I didn't have much success picking up the product w the brush. You'll want to use ur fingers anyway to experience just how soft and plush this unique formula is. Srsly it's like running ur hand thru crushed velvet !"

Even once I placed it back in the pan, it doesnu2019t fill the pan. So perhaps it shrunk & that caused it to fall out? So overallu2026bad presentation. Very unimpressed that a product from Gucci would look like that upon opening, not what one would expect. The color itself is beautiful. I am pale, and this shade looks perfect. Itu2019s truly a natural glow, not too much sparkle/shimmer."

I feel like itu2019s beautiful but the glitter particles are too pronounced for my taste, making it less versatile for everyday wear. The scent is subtle, nothing much.

I can't really make out the scent as much so I can't speak for that. Other than that I would recommend this product as it works amazingly."

This little compact of magic is like having a disco ball for your face u2014 and I mean that in the best possible way.  First off, let's talk about the packaging. It's Gucci, so obviously, itu2019s fancy. But this compact is giving me all the vintage-glam vibes, like something your fabulously eccentric aunt would pull out at a holiday dinner while dropping pearls of wisdom and casually mentioning her time in Paris.   Now, onto the highlighter itself. When I first saw the shade Frosted Lilac, I thought, Is this going to make me look like a pastel alien? Spoiler alert: It does, but like, in a *good* way. The color is this dreamy, iridescent lilac that somehow manages to look both subtle and extra all at once. How does it do that? I have no idea. Gucci might actually have a wizard on their payroll.  Application-wise, it glides on smoother than a TikTok influencer's transition. One swipe, and BAM u2014 you're glowing like you just got back from a vacation on the sun (but without the sunburn or awkward tan lines). And the best part? It doesnu2019t leave that weird, chunky glitter effect. You know, the one that makes it look like you let a toddler do your makeup? Yeah, this is more of a I woke up like this because I am an ethereal goddess situation.  Wear time? All day, baby. I wore this to a party last night, and by the end, I was still shining brighter than everyone elseu2019s future. It didnu2019t budge, and thatu2019s saying a lot because I danced like my life depended on it.   So, should you buy the Gucci Glow Highlighter in Frosted Lilac? Uh, yes! If you want to light up every room you walk into and get stopped on the street by people asking, OMG, what highlighter are you wearing? this is your new best friend. Just be prepared to say, Oh, this? Itu2019s Gucci. And watch their jaws drop."

Sometimes I open the case just so I can shut it again. The snap that it produces is sooo satisfying!! Apropos of the highlighter, I received mine in the shade sunrise gold. She's this rlly pretty pearly white w the most beautiful opalescent lilac shift when swatched. Nothing at all like the gold that the name suggests lol. I wish my camera was able to better pick up the purples in this shade cuz she's rlly not as rosy or metallic as she looks here either. It does not do the colors in this enough justice imho. For the best payoff I strongly recommend applying the highlighter w ur fingers instead of w a brush. Mb it's bc of the powder gel formula but for whatever reason I didn't have much success picking up the product w the brush. You'll want to use ur fingers anyway to experience just how soft and plush this unique formula is. Srsly it's like running ur hand thru crushed velvet !"

In my one photo I compared a swatch to Rose Inc Opalescent (top swatch) and Benefit Cookie (middle swatch) so you can see how much cooler it is. It also doesnt pull too purple on the skin which I appreciate, it makes it easier to use with multiple blush shades. The formula is lovely, the pigment is tightly packed but easy to get onto a brush. There is zero fallout. In the second pic I posted, I applied it with a squirrel hair highlighter brush over Nars Sin blush. I know theres lots of highlighters out there to choose from but this one really is lovely and I recommend it."

It is so beautiful and blends extremely well! I believe the shade I received u201csunrise goldu201d can be used on a wide variety of skin tones. Iu2019m on the more pale side and gold colored highlighter usually looks very obvious but with this Gucci highlighter it looks as natural as a highlighter could possibly look which I love because natural looking makeup for me is best! I added a swatch to show the natural, subtle glow this illuminating powder gives!"

Although it looks white in color it shows up fluorescent on the skin in person, giving a pink/purplish hue which is perfect for a light summer makeup look. There are three shades and I couldu2019ve chosen a deeper tone but nevertheless itu2019s noticeable in person and thatu2019s the highlight of this product! The texture is smooth and buildable on the skin. I used a blush brush to apply the product to the cheekbones. It was amazing! I give this gel to powder highlighter two thumbs up!"
