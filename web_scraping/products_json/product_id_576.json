Makeup keeps getting more expensive and the brands make the packaging and formulas cheaper. Thereu2019s also slightly less product than there used to be (you can check for yourself). These brands will keep doing these as long as we allow them so I really think itu2019s important to talk about these points and not dismissing their greed!"
