The last being the Reboot.  I didn't even know they were discontinuing it until i went to reorder the other day. So this Hydra Glow is taking its place. Schlepped into Sephora thinking I should get a good color match, being as I've used the same shade since forever. Nope. Not even close. In fact, NONE of the shades seemed appropriate. I'm donE with MUFE, which really makes me sad becasue they HAD (past tense) really great foundations. Why they keep messing with it is beyond me. This new one is just a hard no."

It helped a lot, but I still had to add way to many layers for coverage) 2.This product also had too much glow, so it made me look like I'd been sweating at the gym for hours.  3.I had to use a setting powder to hold it in place bc of all the layers and to dull down the oiliness. After about an hour of wear, all that shine was breaking through the powder again. Overall, trying to make this product work was exhausting.

I personally love an airbrushed full coverage look, so if youu2019re like me you will be building the crap out of this foundation, that is, if you prefer a more dewy fresh look and opt to not set with any powders and just a setting/fixing spray it looks great. Setting this foundation with powders completely defeats the purpose of the Hydra-glo formulation which is interesting since my other u201cradiantu201d and u201cglowu201d foundations are able to withstand even a mattifying setting powder. Great makeup-skincare hybrid although there are more longwearing u201cglowu201d foundations on the market."

I have neutral light-medium skin. Iu2019ve tried both the 1N14 (light skin) and the 2N22 (light-medium skin). The 1N14 is slightly light (I look just a bit ashy) when I first put it on, but dries darker. The 2N22 is waaayyy too dark. I look like I put on self-tanner. In both, I end up with a very pronounced line along my jaw. In the 1N14, it might only be because of the orangyness of it, not that it is too dark.

I didn't realize the ok foundations were actually garbage until this one reminded me how good my skin once was. My skin is now clear and smooth again. Coverage is light so if that's not your jam, don't bother with this. There is no offensive fragrance. It's on the more runny side which is fine - the urban decay was too. It blends easily and looks very hydrating.  I would suggest if you like a lighter coverage, more natural look and something that won't irritate extremely sensitive skin, give this a go. I am beyond thankful I did and will absolutely hunt down whoever discontinues it. This is the holy grail after YEARS of trying to find something!!"

It is so easy to apply with a brush or beauty blender and it blends beautifully with cream of powder products. I LOVE the vibrant glow (not shimmery) that it gives my skin and I actually get compliments on how beautiful my skin is, since I've been wearing it. I like a really natural finish that covers my sun damage but doesn't crease or dry out my skin. This is it!   It is definitely buildable for those who like more full coverage however, If you are someone that prefers a matte finish, you are probably not going to like this unless you powder it afterwards. I find it to be very adaptable, meaning I can powder down the finish and then add just a touch of glow with a finish spray or I can leave it on the dewier side.   I've tried other MUF foundations and none of them kept me coming back. I really hope MUF keeps this one in their line-up as I'm a fan for life!"

I thought it wouldn't affect me because it isn't an essential oil but I was wrong. If you have sensitive skin and especially if you're sensitive to essential oils like me then maybe skip this one. The photo is from the morning after I used it so it's going to take a few days to heal up.  I gave it two stars for the performance. I love the MUFE HD skin foundation but I have dehydrated skin so I thought a hydrating option would be great for really dry days but I didn't like this one. It didn't sit well on my skin at all, even right after applying. It didn't get very dry, but it broke up super quickly on my nose and wore off pretty badly on my nose and chin. Also I used Huda loose powder under my eyes and it really emphasized the texture on my nose and near my eyes where the powder touched this foundation. It wasn't the worst but also not very good. I would have given it a second chance to see if I could find a good way to work with it with the second half of my sample, but since it burned my face I won't try it again. I never had these kind of issues with the HD skin formula and I find it very easy going, I can use it with pretty much any skin prep and primer."

Although the color match isn't perfect, it does brighten my complexion better than other foundations I've tried. With proper setting powder, I can achieve long-lasting wear of 10-12 hours, but without it, I've noticed some separation around my chin area after about 6 hours."

I did see that halfway down on the ingredient deck is coconut fruit extract - another ingredient that my dry skin does not tolerate well.  The shade was excellent and if you like a dewy glow, this for sure has it, it's lovely - but it's going back for the afore mentioned reasons.   For foundation, I will stick to my beloved NARS.

This has gone on beautifully, and for a glowy, hydrating foundation, it has stayed together on my face and has been very long-lasting. No excessive breaking up of the product has happened. It has worked fine with my mostly oily skin, but I did set my undereyes with a fine setting powder (Flower Knows) and the periphery of my face with the Huda Beauty loose powder. If you're not sure about this, get a sample and just try this as I think you might be surprised at how well this performs for such a dewy/glowy foundation! This is so pretty! Great job MUFE!"

Itu2019s one Iu2019d recommend for anyone but many have mentioned if you have oily skin it can accentuate oiliness. You can still have a nice glow without much powder but, if you are super oily, Iu2019d pay down with a nice setting powder that isnu2019t too heavy.

According to the site, I should be 3N40 in this dewy one. It is waaaaaay too light! Another reviewer who is the same shade as me mentioned this in their review too and she was completely right. I tried the next neutral shade up and it is way too dark. I wish they would come out with more shade ranges for those of us that are neutral and between tan and deep (including in the matte formula too).

COVERAGE: Good coverage, not too heavy but hides dark spots relatively well.   DURABILITY: Lasts a pretty long time but I find it can get oily and and makes my pores more noticeable.   FEEL: Not as heavy as a high coverage foundation but heavier than I would have liked. I think I would prefer a more easily spreadable, more sheer formula. This is a bit thick and if you put on too much at once it can get sticky and hard to blend in.   SHADE SELECTION: Love the color options. I got matched in the store and found it suited me perfectly. I went for my neck/chest color since itu2019s a little lighter than my face.   OVERALL: Not bad and I can see this meeting some peoples needs. For me however, I felt it was uncomfortable to wear and the oily finish and increased visibility of my pores made me feel self conscious wearing it.

I agree with the medium, buildable coverage claims, and I have a great shade match in 1R02.   Sadly, this contains lemon fruit extract as the second ingredient AND also contains a high amount of fragrance.  It smells strongly like cleaning product, I cannot believe they pumped this foundation with that much fragrance. MUFE please do better for those of us with sensitive skin. We don't need fragrance in foundation!  I received this in PR but these are my honest feelings."

One layer provides light coverage but it can easily be built up to medium coverage while still looking natural.  I would describe the finish as satin on my dry skin- not fully dewy yet not matte.  It can be applied with either a brush or sponge, but I prefer using a sponge because it distributes the foundation more evenly and avoids any streaks.  I got the shade 1R02 which leans more warm and peachy than rosy, but it still blends in well on my fair cool skin.  Even after six hours of wear, it doesnu2019t separate or cling to dry patches.  However, it does transfer unless it is set with powder."

On the skin, it has a very light sensation. It improves the appearance of my skin and can be worn on a regular basis or for special occasions. And the choice of shades is incredible."

Not cakey, even one little bit, and doesnu2019t settle into lines. And it is quite long wearing; I do have to touch up with a little powder after several hours, but thatu2019s normal for me.

The foundation delivered a radiant, healthy glow that made my complexion look brighter and more vibrant.

The texture of the HD Skin Hydra Glow Foundation is luxurious and lightweight, making it a dream to apply. It effortlessly glided onto my skin, and I found it to be incredibly blendable. Whether using a brush, sponge, or fingertips, the foundation seamlessly merged with my skin, creating a smooth and even canvas. What stood out to me was the ease of use u2013 perfect for both makeup enthusiasts and those who prefer a quick and easy application."

It is very lightweight and is more of a satin finish on my skin so I donu2019t need much powder, if any, to adjust shine and set.  It wears well over the day and I donu2019t see any settling into pores or fine lines.  For someone who hasnu2019t used a true foundation in probably over a decade this might bring me back to the foundation fold!"

It didn't make my face oily but I used a setting spray afterwards, and  put  a matte setting spray in my purse in case it got oily.  It took about 6 hours to get some oil on around my nose area and I just sprayed my face with he matte spray  because I still had things to do before going home. But for the most part, during the week when I wore and tested it, it didn't make my face oily because I didn't wear it for 10+ hours. It held on till the end of the day. I do think it oxidizes a bit, not much but maybe the next shade down, so be aware.  It didn't break me out or give me blemishes. Overall I liked it and will continue to use it."

The texture is thick and the scent is light and pleasing. The coverage is medium-buildable, so I used a light concealer on my acne spots and then covered with this foundation and it blended very well. While I tried to match to my skin-tone, I did find this specific shade was a little too orange for me in person - I volley between neutral and cool undertones, and I probably should have chosen to go with neutral for this specific foundation. It's still blendable enough that I can make it match well once I've blended it into my skin. This foundation is great for the winter especially and I recommend it for my combo or dry skin gals!"

The foundation texture is somewhat runny.  Two pumps of foundation applied with a synthetic bristle foundation brush gives me a single layer coverage. This light layer gave me skin tint results that I loved for quick errand days: natural glow, even-complexion but I can still see my freckles and hyperpigmented areas. The foundation feels lightweight and dries to diffused glow-dewy finish. Three to four pumps provide medium to fuller coverage that covered up my freckles and hyperpigmentation with that latter amount providing a completely even complexion. My skin still feels like it can breathe and looks smooth. The finish is lightweight, dewy and radiant. Without a primer and touchup, the foundation wear-time was three hours. This foundation is not transfer-proof. I just used a light dusting of setting powder, and I was good to go. The foundation didn't break me out, and there isn't a perfume or heavy fragrance that I can detect."

I prefer this to something overly matte though. I appreciate the skincare properties to this and that it is a multitasking product. I think this is perfect for the gym, a walk in the park, coffee date, or any day when you want a more natural u201cyour skin but betteru201d makeup look. This lasts all day for me with just powder touch ups in my t zone at the end of my shift. Blends seamlessly into the skin and works well underneath my blush, contour, and bronzer products.

I used Sephorau2019s help with finding my shade match online and it was a perfect match for me. I also like that if I wanted to add any powder to mattify certain areas, it didnu2019t cake up or have noticeable build up. I really love this foundation.

Disclaimer: I received this product in exchange for my honest review.  First and foremost, what sets this foundation apart is its radiant finish that doesn't cross the line into greasy or overly glittery territory, a common issue with many glow foundations. It strikes the perfect balance, giving a luminous glow without compromising on a natural look.  As someone with acne-prone, sensitive skin, and a fair share of texture and dark spots from old acne scars and stress, finding the right foundation is often a challenge. The Hydra Glow foundation, however, offers impeccable coverage without accentuating my skin's texture or pores. It's a true lifesaver for those minimal makeup days and equally stunning for a full glam look.  What impressed me the most is its ability to provide full coverage without the heaviness typical of other full coverage foundations. Despite having scars, this foundation feels lightweight and allows my skin to breathe. It seamlessly blends in, leaving my skin looking flawless, but more importantly, feeling comfortable.  I appreciate that it works effortlessly with both a brush and a sponge, offering versatility in application. No smudging or patchiness, just a smooth, even application that lasts throughout the day.  In conclusion, the Make Up Forever Hydra Glow Skin Care Foundation is a game-changer for those with acne, sensitivity, and textured skin like mine. It has become my go-to for achieving that my skin but better look, making it almost perfect. If you're on the lookout for a foundation that provides excellent coverage, a radiant finish, and feels weightless on the skin, this one's a must-try."

It has a dewy texture that illuminates my skin. I think my skin looks smoother and younger-looking with this foundation on. It covers amazingly while still being buildable. I love that it's a skincare-based formula. It makes me want to wear it more because I know it's helping to improve my skin the more I wear it.

This foundation not only offers excellent coverage but also provides nourishing skincare benefits that leave my skin looking radiant and hydrated. First and foremost, the coverage of this foundation is impressive. It effortlessly blurs imperfections, evens out skin tone, and gives a natural-looking finish. Whether I have blemishes, redness, or dark spots, this foundation has proven to be reliable in providing a flawless complexion without feeling heavy or cakey. One of the standout features of this product is the inclusion of hyaluronic acid. As someone with dry skin, I appreciate the hydrating properties this ingredient offers. The foundation glides on smoothly and never accentuates dry patches or fine lines. Instead, it leaves my skin feeling supple, plump, and refreshed throughout the day. The hyaluronic acid truly works wonders in providing a healthy, dewy glow that lasts. I also appreciate the lightweight formula of this foundation. It feels comfortable on the skin and allows for buildable coverage without ever looking or feeling overdone. I can easily achieve a natural, everyday look or amp it up for a more glamorous occasion without any hassle. Moreover, the longevity of this foundation is impressive. It stays put throughout the day, maintaining its fresh appearance without any significant fading or creasing. Even in humid weather or during long hours, it stands the test of time, which is a major plus for someone like me who is always on the go. The packaging is sleek and practical, featuring a pump dispenser that allows for easy and hygienic application. It also helps control the amount of product, preventing wastage. In terms of drawbacks, the only minor issue I encountered was the price as it falls into the higher price range. However, I certainly recommend it!"
