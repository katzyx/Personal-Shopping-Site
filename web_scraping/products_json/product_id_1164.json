These are not even close to having the high end feel, the creaminess/smoothness or the color payoff as the Audacious formula. They do not wear well at all, so I would suggest a lip primer before use to try and extend the logevity. I'm pretty disappointed in this launch overall. I had high hopes but it's just meh, like most of the other reformulations on the market. I fear beauty brands have cheapened and lowered standards within the past couple years and now NARS falls victim, sadly. Be vigilant with your spending & research. Do not fall for the free or influencer (I despise that word) reviews. It's 98% BS to get more products or they're working directly with the companies. Read ingredients, compare them to drugstore or more affordable products and I think you'd be surprised. These higher end names used to mean higher end products, luxe and worth the cost, but not anymore."
