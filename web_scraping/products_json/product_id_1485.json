I feel itu2019s overpowering, & distracting from both salt air & peach fields. This hair & body mist is just perfection. The wood is just barely there. You get much more juicy peach. Iu2019m in LOVE!! $30 is a little pricey, cause you do have to reapply like most body/hair mists. But Iu2019ll see how long these last me. My favorite way to wear these is do the vanilla sky body mist, let it dry. Then do twice as much peach fields, as you did the vanilla. Have to apply vanilla first though, or it will drown out the delicate peach scent. This is a WINNER Skylar. Iu2019m thinking about subscribing to them again. Iu2019d love to see a salt air body/hair mist. Iu2019m hoping it will be deliciously aquatic, yet light on the wood."
