My life had turned into a nightmare with constant flakes making my head look dirty, as if I never washed it. Large flakes of skin were concentrated at the front of my scalp, and nothing helped. The itchiness was unbearable, and I couldn't stop scratching.  Since incorporating this product into my routine, I've breathed a sigh of relief. This product, along with the massager and shampoo from the same line, has worked miracles. I still shudder when I think about how my scalp used to be. My confidence has returned.  For maintenance, I use this series once every week or two. I love that texture includes tiny granules that effectively clean the scalp without getting tangled in my hairu2014a big plus for those with easily tangled hair.  In addition to its effectiveness, the product has one of the cleanest ingredient lists Iu2019ve seen. Yes, you might lose some weak, already broken hairs while washing, but Iu2019m willing to sacrifice that to keep my scalp in a clean, healthy state."

It works well, but I donu2019t follow the instructions on the bottle because when I used this after shampoo it left a residue on my scalp and it got very greasy. Instead, I use it before shampoo to make sure I can clean it from my scalp. I usually hop in the shower to wet my hair, put the mask on, and then get out of the shower for 10-20 minutes to let it sit. Then I get back in the shower and shampoo and condition with Nutrifol. I am very oily so I am currently more interested in scalp masks with AHA/BHA but I will always have this mask on hand."

After the first time using the product it felt like I was a new person because I already did not feel like I had to scratch my head once for a whole week. I use it once per week until I won't be needed it more than once a month. I don't know what's in this but it s a lifesaver and I truly understand why people are raving about it.

I have now found out from my new hair stylist I have oily scalp but dry hair, so that requires very different care from going in with this mask for my case.  You need to be aware of your hair and scalp condition before trying this. I was close to completely destroying my hair because I thought the charcoal shampoo feels great, so this must suit my hair needs too. WRONG. I only used the shampoo sometimes along side this, so it was not a case of over exfoliating my scalp, it is simply a case of mislabeling making me feel for way too long this could not possibly be the reason my hair became like literal straw and a frizzy mess when I have pin straight silky hair.  I finally realised this was the problem when I didn't touch this for a long time after travelling a lot all summer, and my hair had recovered over a few months, and a salon treatment at ULTA. Then the one time I washed my hair with this, my hair went back to the messy frizz & I panicked and used the repair mask by this brand that IMMEDIATELY rescued my hair next wash. So please, provide accurate labelling as it can be the difference between picking the right product or destroying your hair using the same brand's products."

I follow the instructions and apply after shampooing. It is most effective for me when I part my hair, apply to the scalp in sections and massage it in. At this time, I also like to apply a moisturizing mask to the ends and wait out the 10 minutes. This combination ensures that my scalp is relieved and the rest of my hair is moisturized and shiny.

For years off and on I've had problems with flaking, oiliness, dry patches, crusty/scabby patches, build up -- this line clears it all up. Other clarifying shampoos/masks work for me, but only for one issue one at a time, nothing seemed to handle all of it at once until I tried this line. This whole line is now essential to my weekly routine and has made my scalp/hair so much better, less itchy, oil controlled, no weird crusts/scabs, etc. So thankful this exists. If you're on the fence, grab the very affordable trial version that has all the products in it, you'll get 2-3 uses to see how it goes for you."

It's no longer on their site or anywhere their products are sold except at Beauty Bay, and the value box has already replaced the conditioner! They pulled this on me out of left field, giving me no time to grab it from their site (luckily like I said Beauty Bay still sells it). This is a mediocre replacement to the conditioner!

I have been using the super moisture shampoo and charcoal scrub for years now, and my head loves them! This new product is a win, adding this to my hair washing routine has been great! I only wash my hair once a week, so there is always build up. This has improved my itchy sculp and reduced the dandruff. I'm hoping with warmer weather it will completely go away. There are few things I would improve on the packaging. 1)instead of twist on cap, I would prefer cap that pops up. There is nothing worse than trying to figure out these caps while wet in the shower. 2) thinner dispenser end, to apply directly to the scalp. Now I put it into my hands first then try to apply to the scalp while balancing the tube and cap. I will definitely recommend and repurchase!"

The first time I used it I put it on during the whole shower and it was so hydrating that my hair actually felt greasy- total user error but impressed that it could hydrate it that well. I put it on for the last 5 or so minutes of my shower and it is awesome. It smells like spearmint but doesnu2019t linger once your hair is dry. As someone with seborrhea dermatitis, I found this really helpful for the itching and burning I experienced during flare-ups. The only downfall is it does take a lot of product to cover your scalp. I wash my hair 2-3 times a week and anticipate this will last me about 2 or so months. Very worth it for me though!"

Will continue to use it throughout the summer for chlorine buildup and general upkeep from days at the beach. Definitely give this a try if you need to calm and detoxify your scalp. Need to try with the shampoo as well and see if it provides even better results."

Especially the part of my hair dyed blonde. My scalp was itchy and flaky! After one use of Briogeo Charcoal + Tea Tree Cooling Hydration Mask my scalp doesnu2019t itch anymore and the flakiness decreased dramatically. Applying this mask felt as if my scalp when to a spa to get a facial. I can feel the refreshing and cleansing sensation from the charcoal and tea tree oil. The refreshing sensation of the tea tree oil lasted for at least an hour after rinsing off. NO JOKE! I decided to let me hair air dry and my hair dried off with less freeze. If you have a dry and itchy scalp, this Briogeo mask is for you. Worth every penny!"

I was a little hesitant that putting a mask directly on my scalp was going to weigh my hair down but this did not do that! My scalp feels like it is actually free from any sort of buildup. I use the Living Proof PhD dry shampoo on my scalp every other day, so I feel like a weekly cleanse of the scalp is needed! I don't suffer from a dry scalp but I definitely needed the nourishment. Part of the reason I did buy this was for the cooling sensation but unfortunately, I did not experience this like I had hoped. I do, however, experience the cooling sensation with the shampoo. So I will continue to use them both together. I wish it were 8 ounces like all the other Briogeo masks but I will probably be using this once a week, so it should last me a little while."

A great refreshing scent suitable for AM or PM use with the touch of relaxation. I like to use it after the Scalp Revival Charcoal + Coconut Oil Micro-Exfoliating Scalp Scrub Shampoo. Massage into scalp & leave it on for 5-10 mins. Rinse & condition.  It doesnu2019t make my scalp oilier or speeds up the time for a rewash. It does have a minimal tingly feeling that I look forward to. My hair is softer and scalp is healthier after a few uses. Less irritated, more hydrated and way less flakey. The best part is there is way less active breakout there now!"

I was honestly so impressed just after one use! I like to start my shower off with the Briogeo Scalp Revival exfoliating shampoo and give my scalp a good scrub, and then apply this mask. Itu2019s really easy due to the squeeze tube. I massage it in, then tie my hair up and do the rest of my showering while I let it sit on my head for several minutes.

I've only started to wash my hair every other day since last March and I tell you, they say your hair gets use to it after a month. Everyone is different and for me, NOPE. It's been 11 months since I've started washing every other day and my hair still isn't use to it. The change in routine has caused my scalp to be itchier and in the past 2 months, I've started to have dandruff in my hair. It's really discouraging right?!  My first impression of this mask is just WOW. I've only tried it once and so far, I've noticed my scalp isn't as flakey. This is the first time in months I've been able to go an extra day without religiously washing. My scalp isn't as itchy and I'm excited to continue this hair care journey! "

            "review_text": "Hey Beauties!   I wanted to share this fabulous new product that #BriogeoGiftedMe!   Do you suffer from a dry flaky scalp? Let's be honest this is the time of year that it happens. And of course, with this years harsh winter I've been suffering terribly.   @Briogeo thinks you should treat your scalp as you would your skin with a scalp-care routine.  Just like you exfoliate and hydrate with a skincare routine, you need to do the same with your scalp.   Here are three Key Benefits as to why.   It increases scalp hydration and restores vital moisture post-exfoliation.  Soothes, nourishes, and detoxifies scalp.  Clean and naturally derived, formulated 6-free, and made with their proprietary NOVA Complex that fortifies, nourishes and protect.  Key Ingredients:  Binchotan Charcoal~ Detoxifies the scalp and draws out impurities that clog the hair follicle or that cause buildup on the scalp.  Tea Tree, Peppermint and Spearmint Oils~ Provides a cooling effect to the scalp and reduces itchiness, irritation, flakiness.  Hydration Complex~ Hyaluronic acid and aloe vera balance hydration to prevent future dryness and flakiness.   I absolutely adore how this feels and smells. My scalp feels so good when I use this. I've noticed the dryness is gone and so are those awful flakes! Not too mention the annoying itch. Another win by @Briogeo!  You can grab this fabulous mask at @Sephora!

I leave it on for 10 mins in the shower and you instantly feel a refreshing cooling sensation. The best part is, even after you wash it off and get out of the shower, you still feel the refreshing cooling sensation for a few minutes after the fact. My hair is on the thinner side and pretty oily. This has really helped to get all my dry shampoo residue out, as well as control my oil to get more days between washes. It also smells fantastic!"
