            "review_text": "While I LOVED my airwrap when it worked, and I cared for it, quite literally, meticulously following all available instructions from Dyson, however, despite my great care for my machine, it has decided that it will no longer turn on. it was working perfectly yesterday, but when I went to go use it this morning, it simply refuses to turn on and flashes as if I need to clean the filter, even though I just did two days ago, have only used it once since then, and in general I have kept up with its upkeep, so it in no way is an issue with he filter. I have no clue what happened, it worked fine yesterday, I put it away in its box, I took it back out today's and its nothing more than a paperweight.  I am shocked anything at this price point that has been cared for correctly, with fairly light use, would break in such short time. Dyson has been little help so far, and their customer support hours are basically the same as most doctors, so good luck getting your device issues dealt with in a timely manner if you work a 9-5.   Overall, even if they choose to honour their warranty, I am wholly unimpressed and beyond shocked that their product is so shoddily built. I wash the filter weekly and wash my attachments every three weeks, I store everything in the case it came in including the dryer when it is not in use. The cord still has the original bends in it from when I first took it out of its packaging because I have always put it back the same way, the little computing box on the cord hasn't even had its plastic film taken off of it from when it was brand new. I genuinely cannot think of a single thing I could have done to take better care of this machine, I'm just disappointed that I didn't listen to all the reviews I read before purchasing that warned me about the low quality of the product, and I'm even more disappointed they were right. I will never in my life purchase another Dyson product after this."

I've visited a Dyson Demo store to get professional tips, used various hair products to try and keep the style, watched endless videos for tips/tricks, and I've followed all recommendations on how to use the Air Wrap. Still, my hair doesn't keep its style longer than 30 minutes.  Don't get me wrong, my hair looks AMAZING right after using it (especially the round brush - gives a beautiful salon blow out look). The issue is that it doesn't hold no matter what I do. For someone who's gone above and beyond to ensure I'm using the machine properly and using various types of hair products, there's no point in me keeping this machine if the style won't hold in my hair for longer than 30 minutes.   Such an incredible disappointment. I've sent mine in to Dyson to get it exchanged for a new one, hopefully my replacement machine somehow works better."

And the curls didnu2019t hold. At all. Even with product. My natural curls look nicer and hold better.  The reason Iu2019m giving it a three star is because I thought the brush attachment was as fine. But ultimately, it took WAY too long to do my thin, fine hair with this. It would be faster (and cheaper) to just blow dry and then use a curling wand."

Personally, I found it to be a learning curve but got a hang of using the different attachments after a few uses. After showering I always use the blowdryer and round brush attachments to blowdry my wavy hair straight. I either leave it or keep some dampness to my hair to follow with the airwrap barrel attachment. Iu2019ve experimented with both barrels, varying levels of dampness, different hair products but unfortunately canu2019t get the curls to hold. They always fall to a loose wave and definitely donu2019t hold to the next day. All in all itu2019s a convenient all-in-one tool that I use regularly, but it may be an adjustment for some and you may not get the magical results youu2019d expect at the price point."

Ok so first   of all, I was really septic about these drying tools, even if it is a Dyson, because I had the Revlon brush, and it traumatised me! It ripped my hair so and at the top of my head, so I told myself never again.  The Dyson has the same type of brush to dry your hair ( the round one) but the difference is crazy! It did not pull my hair like the other one did, it left it less frizzy, way softer, and I can just feel there is no breakage!   So it works super good on my curly hair!!  I also curled my hair with the long attachment, it did not stay all day, but it gave me a blowout look for the rest of the day!   Iu2019m a twins mom, so this really saves me time !!  Thank you Dyson"

I used it and it dried my hair in less than 5 minutes and was glossy and smooth looking, not frizzy with fly aways like my old blow dryer. This airwrap is so nice as it gives you a salon blow out look, was also able to achieve nice delicate curls. Not sure about a tight big curl yet but it is a learning curve going from a regular curler to this. The packaging is amazing as all Dyson products are and comes with a beautiful case and many attachments. The airwrap is light weight, swivels on the cord and easy to get the swing of. I would recommend this product to my friends and family!"

J'ai utilise l'embout pour friser et puis j'ai applique du hairspray. Malheureusement, apres seulement 15 minutes les boucles etaient completement defaites. Je ne desirais pas necessairement avoir un reel effet boucle, seulement de la texture et du volume ou un effet blowout. Toutefois, pour 800$, u00e7a ne vaut pas la peine pour mon type de cheveux. Voir l'image pour le resultat 2 heures apres le coiffage. Je crois par contre que u00e7a peut-u00eatre un tres bon outil pour d'autres types de cheveux plus textures et qui tiennent mieux les boucles."

The Airwrap comes with many attachments that works as all in 1 machine.!My favourite is the firm smoothing brush and smooth dyer. It makes my hair smoother, no more fly aways, no fizz. The dyer can dry my hair under 5 mins. I love using it to dry my hair and style it after showering. My hair has never looked better. It is shiny, smoother and healthy looking. The Airwrap is an innovative products that is worth every penny. Thank you #Influenster and #Dyson for sending me this Dyson Airwrap in exchange for my honest review.

More volume, bouncier and while the learning curve is real, it hasn't been prohibitive for me, an absolute hair novice.

It was sold out for a while so i tried some other products and what I've noticed is compared to it's cheaper competitors... 1. Dries your hair faster 2. Volume stays 3. If you're using the curling attachments, you can still use it on try hair - i've used it, slept, and used it the following morning for touch ups... looks just as good 4.  curls last."

The curling barrels did not work well for me as they just curled the ends and then the ends fell quite easily. The air wrap means I could not easy do the top half then the bottom half like I would with a heat tool. They should come up with an extra long barrel.  My sister has the same hair type but shorter and it works well for her. I wouldnu2019t justify the price for just the hair brush accessories so I returned it."
