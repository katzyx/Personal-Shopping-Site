            "review_text": "This is one of many in the Maker line that I am drawn into. I have sampled them all and overall Lover is my absolute favorite, but Stag has me smelling myself over and over. Its top notes are of a Smokey woody warmth scent that will dissipate into a softer and welcoming skin scent. Itu2019s COZY and nostalgic for me because it reminds me of a deodorant my mom would use (soft and dry) but in a very very good way. It makes you want to snuggle in, like a soft warm blanket from the dryer in winter. Itu2019s beautiful!"

To be frank, I originally thought Iu2019d prefer u201cFireu201d by the maker, but Stag takes the cake. Itu2019s sophisticated and unique. Definitely a statement!"

            "review_text": "Stag opens with a bold declaration of smoky leather, immediately drawing you into its enchanting realm. As the journey progresses, a mesmerizing blend of woods emerges, captivating the senses with its hypnotic allure. What truly sets Stag apart is its intoxicating agarwood note, lingering gracefully into the dry down, leaving a lasting impression that defies time itself. Remarkably, its wear time extends well beyond 14 hours, a testament to its enduring quality. Surprisingly, despite initial skepticism based on its notes, Stag emerges as a perfect 10, a fragrance I would wholeheartedly gift to a significant other. In every essence, Stag is not just a scent, but an unforgettable experience. These are my honest thoughts as a Sephora Beauty Insider Community Ambassador."

I should have sprayed a small amount outside, but I sprayed it on my arm. I had to wash it off because it ended up making me feel sick because of the scent. It's especially disappointing because of the price point. I don't recommend this perfume."

Itu2019s a perfect blend if warm, sweet from the leather, and a little spicy. I wear this around the house and even to bed. I get that the unisex thing isnu2019t for everyone, but this is incredibly sexy if thatu2019s more youu2019re thing."
