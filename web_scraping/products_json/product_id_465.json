And frankly, it is very strange using a fragrance free lip balm since I have only used fragranced lip products for majority of my life. However, I do realize that fragrances are not optimal for baby skin that's sensitive and I love that. But it is pretty strange when you smell it and there's no scent. My daughter loved the fact that it's chubby and fit right into her hand and often asked for this product. In terms of hydration for your lips, I do find that there are other products that are more hydrating (like an overnight lip mask) but it does the trick for hydrated kids."

I loved the colors and the packaging its really pretty and inviting.  I applied this on my 1.5 year old son who has sensitive and dry lips. It keeps my baby's lips well hydrated and moisturized. It didn't irritate his skin at all. I used it on my lips as well and it hydrated and soften my dry lips. Best thing of this product is that It's fragrance-free and mostly derived from plant-based ingredients.  It's made with sunflower oil and grapeseeds oil.My first time trying this product but wonu2019t be my last! I would definitely recommend to kids and adults. No more dry lips  #freeproduct"

I tried this on myself and I found that it hydrated well. There is sort of an oily taste when applied from the ingredients in the product. Overall, this hydrated the lips well but like all other lip balms, it needs to be reapplied after awhile."
