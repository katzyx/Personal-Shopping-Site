From the moment I applied it, I could feel its soft and silky texture sinking into my skin, leaving it feeling unbelievably soft and smooth. One of the most impressive aspects of this cream is how it tackled my fine lines. Over time, I noticed a significant reduction in the appearance of my pesky wrinkles, giving my skin a more youthful and revitalized look. The benefits of using this moisturizer went beyond just surface-level improvements. Not only did it provide immediate hydration, but its long-term effects left my skin looking smoother and more radiant than ever before. Plus, knowing that it's formulated by La Mer gave me added confidence in its efficacy. Its ability to deliver visible results, from smoother skin to removing fine lines, makes it worth every penny. If you're looking for a moisturizer that truly lives up to its promises, I highly recommend giving this one a try."

I really enjoyed this product and I would give it a 5/5 but I feel like the price is a bit steep, so for that reason I gave this product a 4/5. My skin feels nice and plump after use but I def think more affordable face creams can do the same job. Would I buy it occasionally if I want to spoil myself? yes!! But def not a staple for financial reasons."

My skin has never been better for sure! It has a fresh scent and creamy consistency.

Now for the product itself: It smells, looks and feels just like your granny\s Olay moisturizer. I actually cannot get over the scent. So powdery and yuck. The cream itself is thick and took forever to absorb into my skin. I used it as a night cream and it was fine. But again, $14 Olay would do the same job for you. There is nothing whatsoever revolutionary or groundbreaking about this moisturizer! These reviewers should be ashamed carrying on that it is \u201cthe best,\u201d etc. Certainly not. I\m willing to bet that perhaps one person in all of these reviews purchased the full sized product. Ludicrous price. I wouldn\t buy even if I was a billionaire.

I have a very large disposable income but even I can't justify spending this much on a moisturizer. Would I recommend to a friend? Yes and no. The product truly is amazing but the price is just not worth it. I would actually feel guilty buying such an expensive product that only lasts so long, and this is coming from someone that literally spends thousands a year on fine jewelry for myself but that at least feels rare. This is just a moisturizer that can be replaced easily. I will not be buying. I feel like it should be a 1/3 or 1/4 of the price that it is. If the largest size was $150-$200 instead of nearly $600 I would be more inclined to purchase this product. This price is actually kinda disgusting."

Plus, it has a lovely fresh scent that's not overpowering at all, which is always a bonus. Ultimately, I think this cream is a must-have for anyone looking to achieve beautiful, healthy-looking skin. It's definitely become a staple in my skincare routine, and I would recommend it without hesitation! The only thing is, it is quite expensive, but for self care and confidence i think its worth it.

Even after the first use, I could already see and feel a difference with the firmness of my skin especially on my cheeks and forehead. This moisturizer has a light weight texture to it which is good because it doesn\t feel heavy or greasy on your face. My face tends to stay very dry regardless of the season of the year and this moisturizer instantly made it feel so much better. My skin is very sensitive but the little fragrance this moisturizer has in it didn\t disrupt my skin barrier. It actually has such a nice clean spa-like scent to it, and wish i could wear it as a perfume. Overall, this moisturizer is top notch, a little goes a long way, and leaves your skin feeling smoother and refreshed without leaving any film texture on your face! Highly recommend giving it a try!"
