But I also can\u2019t think of anything cheaper as a dupe so maybe for that reason it is worth a heartier price tag.

From the moment I applied it, I could feel its soft and silky texture sinking into my skin, leaving it feeling unbelievably soft and smooth. One of the most impressive aspects of this cream is how it tackled my fine lines. Over time, I noticed a significant reduction in the appearance of my pesky wrinkles, giving my skin a more youthful and revitalized look. The benefits of using this moisturizer went beyond just surface-level improvements. Not only did it provide immediate hydration, but its long-term effects left my skin looking smoother and more radiant than ever before. Plus, knowing that it's formulated by La Mer gave me added confidence in its efficacy. Its ability to deliver visible results, from smoother skin to removing fine lines, makes it worth every penny. If you're looking for a moisturizer that truly lives up to its promises, I highly recommend giving this one a try."

I just started using it, so I am not sure about the effects for wrinkles yet but overall I am happy with it. Also, it has a baby powder/cotton smell if anyone cares about the scent."

The cream itself is thick and took forever to absorb into my skin. I used it as a night cream and it was fine. But again, $14 Olay would do the same job for you. There is nothing whatsoever revolutionary or groundbreaking about this moisturizer! These reviewers should be ashamed carrying on that it is \u201cthe best,\u201d etc. Certainly not.

I have a very large disposable income but even I can't justify spending this much on a moisturizer. Would I recommend to a friend? Yes and no. The product truly is amazing but the price is just not worth it. I would actually feel guilty buying such an expensive product that only lasts so long, and this is coming from someone that literally spends thousands a year on fine jewelry for myself but that at least feels rare. This is just a moisturizer that can be replaced easily. I will not be buying. I feel like it should be a 1/3 or 1/4 of the price that it is. If the largest size was $150-$200 instead of nearly $600 I would be more inclined to purchase this product. This price is actually kinda disgusting."

Yes, La Mer makes fancy-fancy luxury skincare so I was thrilled to have the opportunity to try it out.  I used what I could for as long as I could, and a little definitely goes a long way, and I definitely love it. My skin felt softer and looked radiant. Plus, it kept my skin comfortable and hydrated all day long without feeling greasy or heavy. One of the best things about this moisturizer is that I was able to wear makeup over it without any issues. It didn't pill or cause my makeup to smudge or slide around.  Overall, if you have the money to spare to spend on a luxury skincare product like this, I highly recommend it. It's a splurge, but it's worth it for the amazing results. Thank you, La Mer, for giving me the opportunity to try this incredible product!"

Even after the first use, I could already see and feel a difference with the firmness of my skin especially on my cheeks and forehead. This moisturizer has a light weight texture to it which is good because it doesn\u2019t feel heavy or greasy on your face. My face tends to stay very dry regardless of the season of the year and this moisturizer instantly made it feel so much better. My skin is very sensitive but the little fragrance this moisturizer has in it didn\u2019t disrupt my skin barrier. It actually has such a nice clean spa-like scent to it, and wish i could wear it as a perfume.

A little goes a long way, and it is a good expensive moisturizer! I would absolutely love to own a full-size or the whole routine one day. I think that's the only way to properly review La Mer as a brand. *This was a sample, and it's gifted by La Mer."

You don\u2019t need a regular amount of the product to cover your entire face. It also absorbs easily and doesn\u2019t leave a greasy finish. It also made my skin softer than usual. The scent is nice but I personally prefer products that used on mud face to have a less strong scent for my sensitive nose. Overall this is such a pleasant face cream to try!"
