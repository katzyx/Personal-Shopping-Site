This serum is a very thin, non-greasy fluid that easily glides over the skin, and it absorbs so well and quickly that it's just crazy! I truly was amazed by this product for this reason. My skin drank it up like a sponge, and once it dried, I couldn't tell that it was on my skin at all. It has no scent to it, which is very important to me as I am sensitive to fragrance. Immediately after application, I really did notice that my skin looked smoother and softer, and it felt softer, too. I have yet to see what the long-term effects will be like, but so far, after two weeks of use, it has made quite a good impression on me and I think my skin is really going to benefit from its hydration and smoothing effects in the long run.  *Product received for free from Grown Alchemist in exchange for an honest review #grownalchemist #thisisbutterly"

First and foremost, let's talk about the results. This serum lives up to its name. Upon application, it immediately starts to work its magic, leaving my skin feeling incredibly smooth and velvety. The fine lines and wrinkles that used to plague my complexion seem to vanish into thin air, replaced by a youthful radiance that I haven't seen in years. I've noticed a significant improvement in the overall texture and tone of my skin since incorporating this serum into my daily regimen.  One of the things I love most about Grown Alchemist products is their commitment to clean and natural ingredients, and this serum is no exception. Packed with potent botanical extracts and bioactive peptides, it not only delivers visible results but also nourishes and rejuvenates the skin from within. I appreciate knowing that I'm treating my skin to the best nature has to offer, without any harmful additives or chemicals.  Another standout feature of this serum is its lightweight and fast-absorbing formula. Unlike some serums that leave a greasy or sticky residue behind, this one sinks effortlessly into the skin, providing an instant burst of hydration without any heaviness. It's the perfect base for makeup, allowing for seamless application and a dewy, luminous finish that lasts all day.  In terms of packaging and presentation, Grown Alchemist once again hits the mark. The sleek and minimalist design not only looks chic on my vanity but also reflects the brand's commitment to simplicity and elegance. Plus, the pump dispenser ensures that I can easily control the amount of product I use, minimizing waste and maximizing efficiency."

Not only does it boast a luxurious texture that feels amazing on the skin, but it also delivers on its promise of instant smoothing. You can tell the serum consists of only high-quality ingredients right from the moment it touches your fingers.  The standout ingredient in this serum, in my humble opinion, is the Triple Weight Hyaluronic Acid. This complex of three different hyaluronic acids works together to moisturize the deep, medium, and surface skin levels, making it a powerful inclusion.  After just a few uses, I noticed a visible improvement in the texture and appearance of my skin. It feels rejuvenated and looks bright.  Additionally, the serum is vegan ud83dudc07, gluten-free, and the packaging is recyclable u267bufe0f.  Lately, I've had the pleasure of trying out various Grown Alchemist products, and I must say, everything I've tried has been a winner"

I need to add more than 3 drops, maybe 5 drops for it to spread smoothly. I didnu2019t experience any instant smoothing, but I did feel some hydration.

The formula of this serum is very simply and straight-forward, and itu2019s even ceritfied organic, certified toxic-free, and EWG verified (a huge green flag). I used this in the evenings before applying my regular moisturizer. It contains Hyaluronan molecules, which are meant to impart intense hydration to your skin. I tried using it in the mornings before applying my makeup, but found that my foundation and concealer just didnu2019t mix well with this, so I stuck to evenings only. Come morning, my face did look plumper and smoother. I didnu2019t notice any dramatic improvement to my fine lines and early signs of wrinkles, but it seemed like there was a bit of softening taking place. Most of all, my skin is incredibly dehydrated, so I was interested to see how this fixed the issue. In combination with my regular moisturizer and used religiously each night, my face really did look a lot more hydrated and generally just healthier after continued use of this. While a bottle of the serum is only 25mL, a little goes a long way in spreading across your face. Also worth nothing, if youu2019re expecting or hoping for a flowery scent, this wonu2019t be for you. Itu2019s by and large a fragrance-free formula, with its scent best described as being clinical-neutral. This makes it ideal for those with sensitive skin and noses, who canu2019t handle anything overwhelming.   - Product received for free from Grown Alchemist in exchange for an honest review."

The serum also reduced redness and inflammation, leaving my complexion looking more even and radiant.   I would highly recommend this serum to anyone looking for a high quality anti-aging serum or just a serum to help smooth out their skin complexion and add more radiance.

My skin always felt hydrated, I would like to think this helped with the barrier of my skin and kept the moisture in, which is perfect for the current dry winter months. I really enjoyed it!  It's a little pricy, and there's probably more affordable alternatives that produce similar results, but this was very luxe and I enjoyed it, especially the packaging. I only gave it four stars for the amount of product to how much it costs. Effective though!"

Use this serum together with the cream. I put a small amount of serum on the prepared skin, I did not see a conflict with other cosmetics. The serum fits perfectly on the skin, does not create a greenhouse effect. I want to note that during use, my skin tightened a little. There was no peeling, in general, my skin reacted perfectly. I liked this serum, it works but gradually, without stressing the skin. The tool is far from budget, but I liked this bottle. The serum improves the appearance of the skin, works with minor problems. It nicely fills wrinkles, as if smoothing them out. I can't say that I got the result using only one serum, it's a complex care. I recommend the serum!"

Scent: I appreciated the light, natural scent of the serum, which made the application a pleasant experience. My main issue with this product is the size of the sample. It was so small that I could only use it for a few days, which made it difficult to assess its long-term effects on my skin.

I was fortunate enough to receive a sample of this product for free, and I've been using it for about two weeks now.  The packaging is sleek and minimalist, which I appreciate for its simplicity and practicality. The gel formula is fantastic, with a smooth and lightweight texture that's easy to apply and lathers up just the right amount.   One of the standout features of this cleanser is its effectiveness in removing impurities and makeup without leaving my skin feeling overly dry or tight. It's especially suitable for sensitive skin like mine, as it doesn't exacerbate any sensitivity issues.  What truly sets this product apart is its ingredient list. Grown Alchemist uses clean and natural ingredients, including soothing botanical extracts like chamomile, bergamot, and willow bark. The formula is also free from harsh chemicals and sulfates.  In conclusion, the Grown Alchemist Gentle Gel Facial Cleanser has exceeded my expectations. It combines a minimalist design with a gentle yet effective formula, making it suitable for daily use. Whether you have sensitive skin or simply prefer clean and natural skincare, this cleanser is definitely worth trying out. I can easily see myself purchasing the full-size product in the future."

Smooth yes, but behind that, it need to be insert in our daily routine to give its full effect. Globally it's a great product to have near us, but it's not a Life saver for my skin."

The serum goes on smoothly and feels very lightweight on my skin, which is great because I don't like products that feel heavy or greasy. It also has a nice, subtle scent that isn't overpowering.  But what really impressed me was how quickly the serum worked to smooth out my skin. I have some fine lines and wrinkles around my eyes and mouth, and I noticed a significant improvement in their appearance within just a few minutes of applying the serum. My skin looked smoother, plumper, and more youthful, which was exactly what I was hoping for.  Overall, I would definitely recommend this instant smoothing serum to anyone who wants to improve the appearance of their skin quickly and easily. It's a great product that delivers real results, and I'll definitely be using it again in the future!"
