This is my 3rd flat iron from GHD that I have bought in a 8-year-period, and each one of them just randomly stopped working (yes, the famous red light with an annoying beeping sound). Interesting! 900$ thrown down the drain in 8 years, the nerve this freaking company has, they are scamming everyone and laughing all the way to the bank. Their customer service is a joke, you can never get someone to answer the phone, you only get standard replies via email and would only get some sort of help if you are still under warranty. I seriously cannot believe they are stealing from people like that! Yes, the tools are great while they work, but if your purchase one, be aware that you will most likely have to repurchase one as soon as your warranty is up! Yikes. Terrible they deserve a major lawsuit!"

It worked great on mine as well, which is already mostly straight but doesn't respond to heat like at all. It does get super super hot. My only complaint is I wish the heat were adjustable, but then I guess the high heat is what makes it work so well. Definitely would buy again and highly recommend!"

You will hear a beep when you plug it in and then another beep when it is ready for use. I usually do not like big straighteners but this one is very nice. Makes straighten my hair so much faster! I literally only need one slow pass and I'm done. Of course I have baby hairs which I was afraid this would be to big to catch but it did a great job. My hair looked shiny,(think the ceramic plates are to be thanked for that) very straight, and really helps with the frizz. My hair stayed straight for 3 days! Could have lasted longer but 3 days is my max going with out washing my hair. I must also mention this does not have the option to change the heat setting, it heats up to 365u00b0. But I feel that is a perfect heat setting for my hair and does not burn or cause split ends. Also my hair does not get caught between the plates and get pulled. Which is great because ouch! Overall I like it and I have tried to curl my hair with it but I seem to just get tight curls. I need more practice to get the loose curls I want. Ooh also you do get a silicone heat protector cover for straightener which is plus so you can store it when its hot."

            "review_text": "I recently had the chance to try out the ghd Max Styler - 2 Wide Plate Flat Iron, provided as a sample in exchange for an honest review. I'm thrilled to share that my experience with this product was nothing short of exceptional! As someone who's been loyal to a 1-inch Chi straightener for years, I was skeptical about trying a new flat iron, but the ghd Max Styler completely changed that.  From the moment I picked up the Max Styler, I was struck by how lightweight and efficient it is. While I had concerns about using 2-inch plates instead of my usual 1-inch, those worries quickly faded. The iron's larger plates didn't compromise comfort or ease of use in the slightest. In fact, I found that it sped up my hairstyling routine considerably and cut my styling time in half!  My hair, which tends to be curly and coarse, usually demands multiple passes to achieve the desired straightness or curls. However, this iron swiftly straightened and even created beautiful beach waves with ease. I was particularly delighted to find that my beach waves turned out stunningly well with the 2-inch plates.  One of the most remarkable outcomes was how my hair appeared post-styling. Despite my hair being bleached, dry, and prone to frizz, I was amazed by the immediate transformation. The iron not only straightened and styled my hair but also left it looking incredibly shiny and healthy with no need for excessive styling products. Longevity is another area where this flat iron truly shines. The results remained stunning even on the following days, adding to the overall value of the product.  If I had to identify a downside, it would be the lack of adjustable temperature settings. The flat iron is limited to an 'on' or 'off' mode, but considering it reaches a maximum temperature of 375*F, this didn't present an issue for me. Less heat is always a better choice for hair health!"

I have thick, curly hair and it usually takes me an hour - this time it took me 40 minutes. 2) My hair is dry and dull; I noticed right away that my hair looked super shiny afterwards and I had no need to use extra product in my hair to make it look shiny. 3) I was outside after straightening it for hours. From day, when it was extremely hot, until late at night. Usually, my hair would end up frizzy and wavy in this situation. But at the end of the night, my hair was still straight! These were all of the highlights for me. Two other things to note are that I thought it would be uncomfortable or more difficult using 2 inch plates (I usually use 1 inch) but it wasn't either of those things. And I also love that the straightener has a max temp limit of 375deg. - less heat is always better."

Less complicated is better, for me. I definitely felt like this worked beautifully on my fine, wavy hair - I just have a ton of it. I did feel like this sped up the time, though perhaps not significantly enough that I would purchase this simply for that. I would recommend it because it's easy to hold, easy to use, and my hair definitely held the texture much longer than with my old flat iron. I woke up the next day, still with smooth and sleek hair. This is a great product,  and I would recommend to a friend. Pics show my hair texture before and after."

I think this styler helped to really smooth out my hair and reduce the frizz. I also like that it has a swivel cord so it lessens chances of things getting tangled up. It makes it easier to use.

This straighter has pushed my old one to the corner with one use. I used to have to go over certain sections of my hair to completely straighten it. This straighter takes one swipe for silky, smooth, and straight hair. With my old straightener, my hair would only stay straight for 2 days, then start to become frizzy. When I used the GHD straightener, my hair lasted for a full week without restraightening. The single temp feature on this straightener is great, as it doesnu2019t make you wonder if you are using the right temperature for your hair. It also does not snag and swipes very smoothly. The straightener does fee a bit cheap for the price as itu2019s exterior is plastic, but it is great to hold ergonomically. Turns on with a single button and heats up quickly. The wire has a swivel which works great and does not tangle. It does not have a lock setting to keep the plates closed, instead it comes with a silicone cover, which I prefer. No longer will I have to wait for straightener to cool down before storing! All in all, this straighter is a great product. This straightener is better for my hair in terms of styling and reducing damage."

My chi takes longer to straightener/curl because of the smaller plates but mostly because it loses heat halfway through a job and takes a while to heat back up whereas the ghd stays consistently at 365 degrees getting the job done faster. The wider plates means less passes for me. It barely takes 30 seconds for the jingle to play indicating it is at 365 degrees. This straightener tames my frizz & leaves a nice shine. I see people complaining about the 1 temp setting which is 1 major difference from my chi that goes up to 420 degrees but that does not matter when the chi doesnu2019t stay at that heat level consistently. You may think that 365 degrees is not enough but Iu2019m telling you that it is really hot! It straightens and curls with ease. I like the feel of the grip and the long cord. The little cover is great for storing it while still hot but you may want to buy 1 with a heat matt if youu2019re worried about counter tops. You wonu2019t be disappointed with this purchase!"

This straightener smooths even my hair to sleek straight perfection in 1/2 the time as my other straightener with a 1u2019 plate.  Iu2019ve gone literally 75. - 100 passes to 25 to achieve the look I am looking for.  I am able to use a higher heat also with this styler safely with its dual-zone technology.  What used to take me 45 + minutes is now down to 20 thanks to this styler.  You can even use it to create gentle waves or curls with ease.  I would definitely recommend this styler to anyone that straightens their hair.  You two will love the sleek smooth style that you get in 1/2 the time.  I did receive this product complimentary for testing purposes #Influenster"

Once I plugged it in, it warmed up within 30 seconds so you donu2019t have to waste a lot of time waiting for it to heat up. I loved that the power button was on the inner side where the plates are so you donu2019t accidentally turn it off while using. The 2 inch plates were wide and smooth and allowed me to straighten my hair quickly. My blonde, straight hair was smoothed within minutes.  The downside of this straightener is that there is no temperature adjustment. That is my only downfall to the iron. Other than that, everything is perfect about it!"

I was more than happy to test this flat iron because of those issues with my hair, and wow, am I impressed! So easy to use, heats up right away, and works just as quickly.

I have had multiple professional stylists tell me that my hair is difficult. I have lived on flat irons for the past 20 years. I have tried multiple and penny hundreds of dollars on different flat irons always to go back to my original Chi iron from 2010. When it finally died this year I was heartbroken and the new replacement Chi didnu2019t work like my OG. Then this magical Vox Box came into my life. To make a long over- dramatic story short this flat iron is the best thing I have even used on my hair.  I love how there is no temperature control. You just turn it on and go. I love the wide plates for more area coverage. I love how smoothly the hair glides through and never snags the plates. I love everything about it. But most importantly I love how smooth, straight, and frizz free it makes my hair. And it stays that way for days. I have been stopped by strangers telling me how good my hair looks and asking what flat iron I use. I will sing the praises of this flat iron forever. It is the first flat iron that I have ever tried that actually leaves my hair looking healthier after use. It is amazing and I am absolutely not just saying that because I received it free for review. I look forward to many happy years together."

It does heat up pretty quick which is nice but temp is set to 365 and canu2019t be adjusted. It straightened my curly hair nicely without burning it and I like that the cord is extra long.

My only complaint is that with how wide it is, it's impossible to get it close to the scalp. So it does leave some bumps. Still even with that flaw, it's my favorite flat iron ever because of how fast it is."

I didnu2019t think I could love a flat iron more until I tried the GHD gold plated styler. The plates are bigger (2u201d) so it covers more surface area, quicker. The edges are slightly beveled and thatu2019s for giving the roots some volume.  I was skeptical that 375 degrees would be sufficient enough amount of heat, as I typically keep my settings on high. The heat level worked like a charm and literally glides through your hair. I typically can get away with just one pass.

You plug it in, power it on, grab a section of your hair, and itu2019s literally ready to go. There is no waiting to style!

First of all let me start off by saying that my hair resembles that of a tumbleweed. It's super thick, crazy dry from all of the damage I've done to it and it's also extremely coarse. So I will admit that I was more than just skeptical when I received this flat iron in the mail. I figured it was going to be just like all of the other ones I've tried in the past that just did a so-so job. I knew the minute that I opened up the box and took out the iron that this was going to be a game changer for me. It's super sleek and it's not heavy or clunky and it has a power button on the inside of the handle instead of some stupid dial or knob and when I tell you that this thing was fully heated and ready to go in no time that's exactly what I mean. It was insane how fast it took to pre-heat and my hair felt so sleek and straight and it took half the time than my other irons! I couldn't stop touching my hair all day at work, it was unreal because it didn't feel like my hair at all. Oh my gosh it was so gorgeous! This bad boy also has a super long cord that doesn't tangle up on you too. It also comes with a silicone rubbery type glove that you put on the end of the iron to keep it closed once you're finished using it. Great little touch in my opinion. So I will DEFINITELY recommend this product to all of my friends, family and co-workers. I'm 100% satisfied with this amazing flatiron!!"

I decided to just quickly go over the ponytail, rather than taking it down and straightening all of my hair. It took less than 5 minutes to do the ponytail! There is absolutely no tugging or pulling with this styler at all. It is amazing! I also love that there is nothing but a power button. It's literally foolproof...you simply turn it on. The temperature stays so stable, and when I did my whole head for the first time, it took 18 minutes. I'm sure it will take less time as I use it more. The sleeve that it comes with to protect it and the surrounding surfaces is excellent, too. I can't think of anything that I would want them to change about this product. The picture I'm including is from the first time I used it. You can see how frizzy my hair was from the humidity along with how straight it got (it contains no styling products at all and it was still perfectly straight a couple of days later).

I love that it is larger plates, so I can do more hair at a time.  The fact that it stays at a constant temperature of 365 is great so that it doesnu2019t damage my hair. If it had higher settings, I would end up using the higher settings which would cause more damage.   I love how it heats up in 30 seconds and beeps to tell me itu2019s ready!  This straighter works better than my CHI.  My daughter also used it and she has super long hair and loved it.  She said it made her styling so much quicker.  The bigger plates, consistent temp and the auto shut off make this a great straightener!!!"

I have used straighteners for probably close to 20 years now. Most people donu2019t even realize that I have naturally curly hair since I always straighten it. Iu2019ve used several brands (CHI, FHI, Sedu, Hot tools, etc) in the past. I actually purchased the 1u201d inch GHD platinum styler a couple of months ago and really liked it. I was really excited to receive the GHD Max Wide Plate styler to test out. So far I have really liked it. The plates are definitely wider so straightening my hair is a lot quicker! I would agree it takes about 1/2 as much time compared to when I use the 1u201d straighteners. I would say it takes less than 10 minutes to straighten my hair. My hair remains straight for a couple of days so I do not have to worry about having to re-straightening often. The straightener itself is very sleek. It heats up super fast. It beeps to let you know when it is ready to use. The straightener stays hot. I feel like it does a good job of distributing the heat evenly (I donu2019t get those straightening creases). Iu2019ve used it after blow drying my hair and air drying my hair. The straightener works well for either scenario. I do recommend using a heat protectant with it but I also recommend that when using any straightener. Iu2019ve only tried to straighten my hair with this straightener so Iu2019m not honestly sure how it would work when trying to add waves. I prefer to use a curling iron when adding curls or waves to my hair anyways so I wouldnu2019t generally use a straightener for that purpose. I would definitely recommend this styler to a friend."

            "review_text": "For starters, I received the ghd Max Professional Wide Plate Styler for the purposes of testing and review. So as a hairstylist, Iu2019ve faithfully used ghd hair tools throughout my career, so this review is based not only on the ghd Max Professional Wide Plate Styler: itu2019s based on years of experience with the quality and brand itself. Ghd products are exponentially superior to other quality flat irons of its kind. Just for the sake of variety, I have tried other flat irons that are less expensive , but in this case, itu2019s true; you get what you pay for. While ghd has only gotten better throughout the years, their competitors seemed to have gotten worse, as far as quality, that is. The others try to u201cjazz upu201d the items with crazy colors and fancy packaging , while ghd maintains the u201cgold standardu201d of producing an amazing and quality product, without all the outer bells and whistles. This is, in my opinion, due to superior and grade u201cAu201d materials all day, everyday. No need for neon colors or celebrity sponsors. The iron sells itself. With an extra long cord and swivel movements it makes straightening your hair a breeze. With 70% larger ceramic plates, the iron is kept at the optimal temperature of 365u00b0 . No more extreme heat. And no more damage with related use. With a cool temperature tip, it makes beach styling waves effortlessly without burning the tips of your fingers, as I have in the past with other brands. As a professional hair stylist, Iu2019m used to paying top dollar for quality hair appliances . So I understand why, as a typical everyday consumer the price tag of $219 + plus tax can be quite expensive. And while it is, you will never find an iron quite like it. While you may have to repurchase a cheaper brand iron two, maybe three times; youu2019ll only need one ghd. For reference, I have long curly and frizzy hair, so I love the larger size. It gets the job done quickly and easily with just one pass. Auto sleep mode after 30 min. Worth every penny!"

It has a slight wave to it too. When I received this, I tried it the very next day and really loved it. Itu2019s very sleek looking and I appreciated that it came with a plate cover so you can throw it in your luggage etc when you travel. Itu2019s has a pretty long cord so youu2019re not committed to one particular spot if youu2019re a multitasker like myself. I also like that it has a little chime so you know itu2019s plugged in and that itu2019s heating up. Itu2019s super fast at heating up. Now for how it performs. I absolutely love it! Since the plates are 2u201d you can get your hair done a lot faster. For my hair length/type it takes me about 5 mins from start to finish. I typically straighten my hair but I also tried creating beach waves with it and they looked awesome. Just took a little longer but probably bc I still need to get used to it. Iu2019m also a fan of the fact that it sets itself to heat at 385 degrees. My hair doesnu2019t feel crunchy like with others Iu2019ve tried. My hair feels smooth and even almost healthier. I know itu2019s the flat iron bc Iu2019ve needed toner in my hair for months and feels pretty rough with my other flat iron. All in all, Iu2019d definitely recommend! GHD makes some pretty great products (I own a hairdryer too)."

And this didnu2019t do it for me. I could feel my hair being pulled and snagged (worst sound ever) even when I barely clamped down on the plates. (For a beautiful buttery-smooth silent glide, Iu2019ve never found better than my T3 SinglePass straightener.) Also a little odd that you have no control over the temp. Itu2019s a one-temp only straightener, which means if I want to straighten my baby hairs and edges, I have to fry them at a  whopping 365 degrees! So those are the pros and cons.

I straightened my whole head remarkably quickly and my hair was still shiny and wasnu2019t sprouting a bunch of broken ends throughout. The only issue I had was that it has one temperature setting. I donu2019t love this because Iu2019m wary of heat damage and always want to use the least amount possible. However, ghd indicates the heat is the perfect amount. I balked at this initially, but after a day outside near the ocean and in Southern California mist, my hair was still straight and minimally frizzy. I was shocked. I didnu2019t use anti humidity spray or anything after flat ironingu2026and it lasted. That is atypical for my hair, so I am inclined to think ghd knows what they are talking about regarding the temperature. For my hair anxiety, I would still prefer the option, but it is not a deal breaker."

This flat iron is perfect for my needs and type of hair that I have. I took pictures of my hair before (was braided all day) and after I used the iron. took me less than 10 min. it's very targeted product, and I appreciate clarity in the description. so if you have damaged or thin hair stay clear. there is only one temp setting and it's pretty hot, so heat protecting product is a must. I like clean and fool proof design, one button with light indicator and sound warnings. Really like finish of it too, it's grippy and feels nice to the touch, and finger print resistant. Unit is not too heavy, so combined with wide plates you should be done in no time before arms get tired. Love silicone sheath as well. Added bonus is if you have bearded partner this iron is perfect for mask beard"

As soon as it's plugged into a power source it gives a little chime telling you there's power, you have to turn the power button on and it beeps telling you its on as well as lights up. It takes a few Seconds and its HOT! Love that there is no wait time.  I was worried that I couldn't adjust the temperature myself and had to put blind faith that it wouldn't be too hot and fry or damage my hair, but It glides through my hair effortlessly. There was no scorching and once through was enough with my hair to get it perfectly straight. Which isn't easy to do. I have long wavy hair and it worked marvelously. I even got it to curl my hair. It makes beautiful waves that held all day. I love the fact it comes with an auto shut off I dont need to worry about that when I leave if I remembered to unplug it bc I often times don't!"

They are smooth with high gloss coating to enhance shine. Design is very sleek with curved edges , which allows me to create smooth style or loose waves. It heats up in thirty seconds and also switches off after thirty minutes of non-use. Temperature is already pre-set to 365F, which provides safe hair heat for every hair type. I always had frizzy hair, and it usually takes a couple of passes with my CHI, but not with GHD. I just need one, and my hair feels silky and frizz free. There is no damage, and my hairstyle last till next wash. I received this GHD styler from Influenster and GHD for free, in exchange for my honest opinion, and this is my honest opinion. Thank you for this wonderful opportunity."

This flat iron definitely did the job.  I was able to flat iron in 15 - 20 minutes.  I have long thick wavy/curly hair so it can sometimes take a long time to get it as straight and smooth as I want it.  I also didnu2019t blow dry my hair straight first because I really wanted to see how well it worked.  I was able to straighten thick sections of my hair with one pass.  I was so happy with the results.  I love that it heats up in seconds and also that I didnu2019t have to adjust the temp.  The flat iron I normally use requires me to adjust to temp to about 420 to get my hair as smooth as I like it. I would definitely recommend for someone who had thick wavy/curly hair!"

I let my hair air dry and didnu2019t use any styling or shine enhancing hair products.   Typically it takes 30-40 minutes to straighten my thick, wavy hair. The ghd Max took just 11 minutes! No lie, I timed how long I used it. I got a full on sleek look in about 1/3 the time! I only needed to go through each section of hair 1-2 times as opposed to the 4-5 times I usually take. Less straightening time means less hair damage.   Iu2019ve used a lot of straightening devices over the past 19 years. None impressed meu2026 until now. I love the ghd Max and I wonder where this device has been all my life. Iu2019ll never waste 30+ minutes again trying to achieve a gorgeous, sleek u2018do.  Iu2019m attaching two pics. One is of me with air dried hair and no styling product except a heat spray. The next one is of me 11 minutes later with shiny, smooth hair thanks to the ghd Max.   I received this product to review.

I did take some time to watch YouTube videos of different ways I could use the flat iron- straightening, obviously, but also ribbon curls, waves, adding volume at roots. This flat iron is VERY easy to use. There's only one heat setting, which is great. It heats up quickly and the outside doesn't get too hot. I'm a mom and I felt safe having this product around. Some other heat tools feel like they would be very easy to accidentally burn yourself on.   I decided to try the flat iron out for straightening and a few waves before a Zoom call for work. During the conference call, three coworkers dmed me to tell me how nice my hair looked. This has never happened. It's true. When you use the straightening, your hair is very shiny. My hair is medium thick and just a bit wavy. I was able to get done in about 10 minutes. The iron heats up quickly, so you could really get ready fast with this.   As a challenge, I decided to try straightening my husband's very thick and curly hair. I did half his head in about 10 minutes. I think it I went over it again, it would be very smooth and shiny. I truly didn't think this would be as easy to use and straighten hair like his so easily. Final verdict: if you want people to compliment your hair, if you want a very versatile tool that is easy to use, try this flat iron!"

I found that this product worked miracle on my hair. My hair is very sensitive to styling tools and get freezy instantly. This styler is very gentle, is not super hot but made my hair feel like silk. It also heats up almost instantly and comes with a sleeve to put in after styling is complete. It is also very lightweight what makes styling super easy and enjoyable. Love it!"

I have medium length, fine hair so I was a little worried about this since it says its better suited for long and thick hair. But I actually really like this iron!! It wasnu2019t too hot for my hair, and styled it perfectly smooth without drying it out. The plates didnu2019t catch or snag on any of my hair either so shedding was minimal when I used it. The rounded edges are really great for curling, which is how I normally use a flat iron anyway. I would say itu2019s definitely worth the price tag!"

I like the GHD better. It also comes with a silicone cover that slide over the end to protect from the heat after you have finished. Thank you for letting me try this for my honest review."

Plus, it's too thick to really be able to easily get close to your scalp so, unless you're ready to dedicate some REAL time and effort, you end up with a bump in your hair. My hair is fine and not really long, it's right under my shoulders, but still the length of the plates is too short to get very much at all so I have to go over less at a time, which of course means more times in total. For over $200, you're flat iron should be easy to use and as quickly as you need it to.  I tried this one ghd gold max bcz of the 5 star reviews and bcz I was salty that my Babyliss stopped working after only 2 years (my previous one is 10 years old and still works great but I gave it to my daughter) but it was about $40 less than this one and way better. Guess I'll have to go back."
