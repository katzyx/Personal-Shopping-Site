    "about": "Fragrance Family:Florals.Scent Type:Warm Florals.Key Notes:Mandarin, Ylang-Ylang, Vanilla.Fragrance Description:A fresh, floral explosion of femininity, this radiant reinvention of the iconic Good Girl scent reveals the multifaceted nature of modern womanhood with a double dose of sensual vanilla and exotic ylang-ylang..About the Bottle:This fragrance is housed in a delicate pastel-pink stiletto..About the Fragrance:Inspired by powdery blush, this 100 percent vegan perfume contrasts the sensuality of two different vanilla extracts with the romanticism of a peony heart note. The vanilla and ylang-ylang it contains are each sustainably sourced.",
    "ingredients": "Alcohol Denat., Parfum (Fragrance), Aqua (Water), Hydroxycitronellal, Limonene, Benzyl Salicylate, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Linalool, Hexyl Cinnamal, Citral, Alcohol, Tris(Tetramethylhydroxypiperidinol) Citrate, Coumarin, Benzyl Benzoate, Benzyl Alcohol, Ci 14700 (Red 4), Ci 60730 (Ext. Violet 2).",
    "how_to_use": "Suggested Usage:.-Fragrance is intensified by the warmth of your own body. Apply in the creases of your knees and elbows for a longer-lasting, stronger scent.&nbsp;.-After applying, avoid rubbing or dabbing skin. This breaks down the fragrance, causing it to wear off more quickly.&nbsp;.-If you prefer placing fragrance on your wrists, be sure to reapply after frequent handwashing, as this tends to rinse off the scent.&nbsp;.-Replace fragrance after 12 months. Expired perfumes more than a year old lose the integrity of the original scent...Eau de Toilette or Eau de Parfum?: .The difference lies in the volume of perfume oil. While EDT contains five to nine percent, EDP contains more, usually eight to 14 percent. EDPs, therefore, last longer and smell more intense.",

            "review_text": "I am so picky about perfumes and I can not stand most of them. I have been on the lookout for my signature scent forever, and I found it in this. This is the first time I bought the full size of any perfume because even the ones I can tolerate I don't like enough to really commit to. Every time I have shared this with a friend they love it and go buy it for themselves immediately. To me, it smells like a bubble bath at the beginning. Specifically like the strawberry bubble bath for kids that came by the gallons we all used but way more subtle and less artificial. When it dries down, it smells a little more gourmand and vanilla. One thing I don't like about a lot of the most famous perfumes is how sharp and overpowering they are. This is soft, feminine, and powdery and the floral is very subtle and bright, not at all grandma-like. Personally, I didn't think it lasted very long as I couldn't smell it after about an hour or two, and this was my only disappointment with the product. However, people always tell me I smell good and ask what I am wearing long after I think the scent has worn off so perhaps you just become nose blind to it. Lastly, this packaging is the cutest I have seen and I love the color. I think it's so fitting that the one perfume I like looks like this!"

Because of where the spray nozzle/button is, when youu2019re spraying youu2019re applying pressure to the heel so I feel like one day itu2019ll just snap off.

This reinterpretation is definitely more sensual than her most popular Good Girl scent. The top notes of Bergamot and Bitter Almond really shine through when you first spray it. As it develops it starts to reveal a bit of Peony and Ylang-Ylang, and when it settles you can smell the base notes of Vanilla, but not in a sweet way. To me, it definitely gives more of a mature, warm, floral scent. Itu2019s a very wearable perfume for any age group. My daughter who is in her 20u2019s has been stealing it, and my mother who is in her 60u2019s also quite enjoys it! Iu2019ve been wearing it to work most days, and while the scent does fade a bit throughout the day I can definitely still smell it at the end of my work day. You can expect it to last at least 7 hours. The iconic Caroline Herrera perfume bottles are gorgeous! The packaging definitely accentuates the luxurious aspect of this perfume experience. The high heel stiletto bottle fades into a light, soft pink color that fits with the name of this perfume perfectly. It is a bit on the pricier side coming in at 175$ Canadian for a 50ml bottle, but it is so worth it! Highly recommend!"

Floral but not overpowering and a little bit sweet but subtle. I only use one spray and it lasts all day I love that I get wafts of it throughout the day, reminding me of how pretty the scent is. I do not feel like it's overpowering and like I can't go into shared spaces without affecting someone with scent sensitivities. One tip for the 30ml version, you have to remove the stiletto part to get to the sprayer, I was terrified I would break it the first time and its so cute I would be so sad. Twist it don't try to pull it off! Overall absolutely love and highly recommend!"

Carolina Herrera Good Girl Blush Eau de Parfum is the newest addition to the Good Girl fragrance collection from this powerhouse. It comes in the most gorgeous packaging I've ever encountered: a perfectly pink stiletto bottle that's not only beautiful but also a functional addition to any desktop. You could even use it as a phone test just for fun.    The fragrance itself is a romantic take on the original Good Girl scent. It's got a fresh, floral, peony-vanilla combo. The peony is quite clearly the star although the other notes help to elevate everything including a double dose of vanilla, two forms of ylang-ylang and upcycled rosewater. It's delicate and feminine. Plus I find even with the smallest spray that the fragrance lasts hours and isn't overpowering. I absolutely loved it and the amount of compliments I receive while wearing this perfume is unprecedented.   Thanks Influenster for sending me this little gem.   Fragrance Family = Floral Key Notes = Top - bergamot mandarin Middle - ylang ylang Base - vanilla absolute tonka bean"

The stiletto shape design is so New York vibes with a cute pink, edgy black and elegant gold colour pops. The heel coming off to reveal the sprayer is a great touch. The scent is very floral and powdery like when you first apply. I find it lasts on the skin until the end of the day but it wears off to a vanilla like note by the end of the day, no longer floral like as when first applied. It's a scent I can wear everyday as a fresh girly flowery scent. I would not use this as a night scent for myself but as a day only scent. I would not buy this again but I do enjoy it!! I like flowery scents but this was almost a tad too much floral, but it was still nice."

Also, the top note of almond oil really is not something I appreciate. The flowery aspect of the perfume is not so bad, however, it certainly is more of a peony scent (not my favourite when it comes to a perfume). I found the perfume to be medium lasting, and I did not feel anything special while wearing it. There are better options out there."

I actually love the design of the perfume bottles. The iconic stiletto bottle is feminine and playful. I have to admit I did not love the fact that ( on the 30 ml sized bottle at least)  the entire stiletto heel must be removed to spray the perfume. The bottle cannot stand without the heel, and I found the heel portion difficult to remove. Not a big deal, just awkward. Perfume smells different on everyone, so I always test it on my skin, AND my clothes. I actually preferred this scent on my skin, over my clothes. This scent, to me, had a very citrusy, almost bitter opening note, then I got strong floral, then finally a sweet powdery drydown with a hint of vanilla.  I love the final scent. I did notice that it does not last long on my skin. Though this will not be the scent I reach for over and over, it is very pretty and I really enjoyed wearing this fragrance.

However one spray is more than enough and found it rather strong.

When I first sprayed it, I was getting hints of floral. The scent is very light and beautiful. I wouldn't call it overpowering at all. I really like how it smells. I wasn't expecting it to rank as high as my favorite perfume, but it is up there.  I found that the scent had a decent amount of staying power, but by the 10th hour, I couldn't really smell it anymore.  Overall I am very impressed with this perfume, and I will be purchasing it again in the future."

This fragrance has great staying power, not cloying at all at first spray and my husband, who rarely comments on perfume, complimented this one.  Automatic win, lol!  The only little annoyance with this one was the bottle itself - the capu2019s fit was very tight and I was sure I was going to end up breaking the thing before the first spray.  If someone was new to the Good Girl and Bad Girl bottles, they would be quite confused on how to exactly get the top off.  Very minor issue though, would recommend this fragrance no problem."

The perfume itself smells really good and is a nice everyday scent that I would wear all year round (maybe more suited for spring/summer but who cares). My husband describes it as sweet, but more mature than typical candy sugary teenager scents. It smells floral with a sweet background. Very, very nice."

I love the pink/black/gold colour combo and the high heeled shoe for a bottle is just genius. It's nice to have something fun and different on the shelf instead of just a regular bottle. It was a little tough at first to get the lid off, I was afraid that I might snap the heel but once I got it off it was smooth sailing the next few times.  I do not have a nose like my husband who can pick out every note in a fragrance. I found the flower scent to be overpowering for my taste and wish that it had been a little softer. I find when you first apply it is too much but after about 45 minutes its a more bearable scent. I had hoped for something a little more unique with all the scents in it but find it very generic smelling and not something that stands out for me. If you like flowery, strong and fairly long lasting this one is for you.  I see myself wearing it more in the warmer months of the year and will use over time but not something that I would rush out and buy again when it is gone."

The warmth of the vanilla really makes this a great cozy scent for the colder months. This perfume has nailed making floral fit in a warm cozy way.

The perfume dries down into a lovely powdery scent of peony, roses and ylang ylang. I can smell some bitter almond and bergamot as well which are the top notes of this perfume. The perfume sprays on strong, but the scent becomes very subtle within 2-3 hours. I think that it makes a great perfume for springtime. The one thing I don't like about it that the fragrance is not unique, it smells very similar to another perfume I owned."

I can put it on in the morning and in the evening you can still smell it. I've gotten many compliments from people on this perfume. My husband who has an allergy and a sensitivity to many perfumes is okay with this one. I always give him the bottle to smell before I even put a perfume on. And this one doesn't bother him at all.

A lot of people have been comparing this to a u201cshampoou201d it u201csoapyu201d smell.  It does remind me of the OUAI detoxifying shampoo but thatu2019s not a bad thing.

Good Girl Blush is a powerful and feminine sweet fragrance. One spray is all it takes for your senses to be immersed in the floral aroma, and one look at the exquisite high heeled bottle will give your confidence and femininity an immediate boost.  The scent is long lasting and can be overwhelming if overdone. Personally I see it more fit for an evening out or special occasion, as opposed to everyday use, as it is quite powerful.  CH Good Girl Blush is definitely a signature scent that leaves a sultry aromatic trail of beauty, elegance and confidence."

Even when I'm done, I plan to keep the bottle for decoration. Just too beautiful to throw out. Like far away and you can recognize it by its distinct packaging. My only fear was knocking it over and breaking the bottle.  My fav scent is anything floral. So was very happy to receive this. It's labelled as a floral scent that is a mix of vanilla, mandarin, and ylang-ylang. Found it to be a captivating nice sweet powdery floral & vanilla scent. It lasted the whole day. By the day of a long day, some of it wore off but was able to still detect a faint scent lingering.

I may not look like a woman who should even try to walk a mile in those shoes but everyone thinks this scent suits me & smells great on me.  I make good money working in a shop using tools all day, wearing sweatpants and a sweater that are tattered and stained, with a bit of makeup on. After applying it for a long 10 hour work day, I canu2019t smell it but my boyfriend can still detect it, finding it clings to my clothes more than my skin. I wish I could smell it for longer than a couple hours on myself.

I immediately get hit with a burst of delicious mouthwatering fruity citrus which are the notable notes of Bergamot and Mandarin Oranges.  After about 15 minutes in, it dries down into this lovely powdery bouquet of flowers:   Peony, Exotic Ylang-Ylang and Rose water with a yummy creamy background of Vanilla throughout.  The perfume is housed in an exquisite Pastel-Pink Stiletto Heel symbolizing female empowerment. The bottle is quite striking and eye-catching making it a memorable gift for that beauty lover in your life who loves luxury fragrances. Overall, I truly enjoyed this perfume! It made me feel beautiful and well put together.  The projection was great and I got a solid 6 hours of wear time before having to reapply.

The scents are VERY powerful, one spritz is enough to give a long lasting impression. If you donu2019t like strong scents then these might not be for you. To me it delivers a floral scent. Definitely leaves a statement of femininity, it gives me the Elle Woods vibe. Overall itu2019s been a great addition to my collection, but one Iu2019d reach for in a girls night out. Recommended."

This is marketed as a warm floral inspired by powdery blush, this 100 percent vegan perfume contrasts the sensuality of two different vanilla extracts, peony,vanilla and ylang-ylang.  When I smell this, it reminds me of a sophisticated modern powdery floral. I absolutely love the scent, its unique. I get the powdery florals and the dry down is definitely more vanilla. A little goes a long way with this one and it lasts ALL DAY.   I feel like this would be a perfect night out fragrance. It's sexy without being overly floral and it's not fruity. I love the softness that envelopes the floral notes."

First impressions, the bottle is probably one of the coolest looking bottles I've ever seen. The gold stiletto, pastel pink sole, is not only sexy, but it is sophisticated sitting on my dresser. The mixed notes of mandarin, ylang ylang and vanilla bring such warmth reminding me of candy and flowers.If you spray too much, it is quite strong, however once it settles its quite beautiful. I did notice however that the smell on my skin didn't last the entire day, it did last longer on my clothes, but that was ok as many places these days try to remain scent free. Normally I don't gravitate to vanilla and prefer only floral scents, however this is perfect for a transitional period from summer to winter."

If it were a colour, the pink of the bottle is a perfect depiction. It's hard for me to think back this far but it almost reminds me of a sophisticated exclamation! for those of you in my age group!  It is a nice perfume with a lasting scent. If you like Candy by Prada or Les Belles de Ricci you will love this. That said, this bottle was a gift from Influenster for an honest review so honestly... This would not be a perfume I would choose for myself. The scent profile isn't my preference. Also, I really really don't like the name Good Girl. I feel it's a patronizing and infantilizing term especially for anyone who is out of the girl age bracket. I also think the contrast of the name vs. the stiletto shape of the packaging suggested that the term is being using in a sexualize manner. Wear this wile you're watching or reading 50 Shades. If someone asked what I was wearing, I'd hesitate to truthfully reply because telling someone I'm wearing Good Girl is to me, cringey.  I also think we need to hold these brands and manufacturers accountable for the manufacturing. This bottle has a LOT of plastic parts; plastic parts which are not recyclable. I know so many of you comment on how beautiful some packaging is (and I agree!) but it's wasteful."

This is definitely an unapologetic fluorescent scent, with only traces of an underlining bitter almond and tonka bean. The bottle is a pink stiletto heel that is meant to be slightly provocative but also amusing and lighthearted. Itu2019s certainly a fun design and works well if purchased as a gift.  Good Girl Blush has a gentle medley of vanilla and ylang-ylang. Itu2019s a sophisticated blend but with a youthful, fun residue. As the day progressed, I noticed a stronger scent of peony popping through. I feel this is a good scent to wear for cocktail hour or brunch with friends, more aligned to a daytime wear than evening."

Itu2019s very unique and unlike any other perfume I have had (and Iu2019ve had A LOT!)  The scent is amazing - I was worried the vanilla might be too much as I donu2019t love strong vanilla scents but this is so light and it blends well with the floral notes.

This scent is great for every day, a summer heat date night, or a job interview. With this scent be sure to know that almost everyone will be asking what youu2019re wearing- its that good !   The signature Carolina shoe design and soft pink colour scheme is quintessential making this perfume an excellent gift choice for your mom or girlfriend. Do not hesitate on this one ladies - shes a keeper !"

There is no powdery smell which can happen with some vanillas and I hate that so Iu2019m glad it dosent have that itu2019s just perfect  will definitely be putting this into my fragrance rotation and using it lots also I will be recommending this to any and off of my friends since it smells so divine  and lasts all day"

At first glance the colour and glass bottle is really nice and feminine, would make a fantastic gift for someone. The button to spray is plastic and a bit cheap but it does the job and hasnu2019t given me any issue. Unfortunately this fragrance does not smell good on me at all. Being in my early 30s this just smells a bit old and powdery, yet very sweet with vanilla hints. I get no mandarin or ylang-ylang notes from this which I was most excited for. Iu2019m not sure if this smells bad with my skin chemistry or itu2019s just too powdery(and a bit spicy) but Iu2019m bummed it didnu2019t work out for me as I was so excited for it. My mom tried it on, and although it smelled much better on her, she did not like it at all, nor did my dad or boyfriend. Thank you Influenster, Sephora and Carolina Herrera for the opportunity to try this!"

My concern is that when I spray it, my hand will accidentally break the heal off because of where you have to squeeze so be careful. I give it 4/5.

I was wrong, it does!!  The opening is a little powdery, sweet with the first hints of floral. It only takes a minute to settle before the peony and tonka make their appearance. Its subtle at first, then very quickly bold. As it develops on my skin, the other notes become obvious and turns this perfume into a beautiful, sophisticated, womanly dream. The dying breaths of it are a creamy, warm scent with only slight sweetness.   This perfume lasts a LONG time on me - i can still smell it the next day. Spray it on after a shower and moisturizer and it will lock it in. This is the kind of perfume that performs well on heat points. If you need a comparison, think floral Prada Candy"

I find itu2019s quite strong at the outset, not unpleasant but instantly reminds me of the cash area at a Victoria Secret store, just too much all at once and cloyingly sweet. I generally gravitate towards sweeter scents but itu2019s just way too much for me and it was overpowering. That being said after a while and as it gets more faint it is nice. It is certainly long lasting but the initial is just too much."

It has some floral as well as some fruity/citrus notes in it as well. A few sprays are all you need and it will stay with you all day. The bottle though not very ergonomically designed, and a bit confusing to use, is most definitely an eye catcher. It looks gorgeous on my dresser and is a great addition to my perfume collection.

It's a very sweet, powdery, floral perfume that smells very luxurious. I recieved a lot of compliments while wearing this! I feel it was pretty long lasting, it does get a bit softer over time but by the end of the day my boyfriend said he could still really smell it on me.

Despite my allergies and sensitivities, I love perfume, the way a scent can invoke feelings and memories is incredible, so I was thrilled to receive this VoxBox and give this scent a try!  This Good Girl Blush is intended to be a lighter version of the original, featuring notes of bergamot (which I adore), citrus (mandarin orange), peony, ylang-ylang, rose water, vanilla, and tonka bean. I was excited by the notes in this perfume, these notes can be easily identified in the scent when on.   I will say while the bottle looks beautiful and fun, I wasnu2019t the biggest fan of the mechanics of it. Iu2019m a spray the perfume in front of you and walk through the mist kind of person and where the trigger is for the bottle doesnu2019t really allow for a simple hold on the bottle, you have to kind of hold it sideways and turned a touch. It still works but itu2019s not my favourite bottle design from a functionality standpoint.   The trouble with this was that while this is a lighter version to the original after you spray it on the rest of the house also now smells like the perfume making it difficult to differentiate the scent on me directly. The scent is lovely overall but honestly not my favourite one. I didnu2019t have any negative interactions with my body chemistry or my allergies, itu2019s just a bit too much of a scent for me, itu2019s strong. Now it does dissipate as time goes on but overall Iu2019m personally just not the biggest fan.   If you enjoy the original then you will likely fully enjoy the Blush as well. If you havenu2019t tried it, I would recommend getting a sample first before buying a whole bottle.  So in summary, I am grateful to receive this perfume and give it a try. Good Girl Blush is a lovely scent, itu2019s just not my overall favourite in my collection. Would I recommend you give it a try yes, itu2019s lovely and may just be your fav!"

It has a lasting staying power on your body and if you are someone like me who sometimes gets headaches from strong scents you donu2019t need to worry!  Also if you are looking for a bit of glam the bottle is one of my favorites! Really stands out  in the bathroom!  100 percent recommend!!"

What eye catching and original packaging! This perfume is advertised as fresh, floral, powdery and feminine. All of these descriptions ring true. When I used it, I love the smell. A little goes a long way and it has serious staying power and lasts a long time. The scent notes are that of vanilla and peony. It also contains ylang ylang and upcycled rosewater. All in all I really enjoyed this perfume and would definately recommend because as they say, It's good to be bad."

The initial floral scent is noticeable for a few hours after applying, and I definitely could pick up on the vanilla notes 7-8 hours later. I think this would also make a wonderful gift for someone, not only for its delicate floral scent, but also the pastel pink stiletto bottle would look beautiful on anyone's vanity.

It has easily become one of my top 3 scents of the year and I will continue to enjoy it throughout this and my next several years. The bottle is sleek, elegant, and a great nod to to the feminine notes found in the actual perfume. I could never wear heels, but having this one in my bag at all times I can tell will significantly increase my confidence. Small note, the button to activate the perfume spray function can be a bit challenging for stiffer fingers or someone struggling with fine motor strength.

The bottle is like a sheer-yet-frosted blush pink and protects the perfume from sunlight. The scent is like a floral powder, but it's very light and not like old-woman powdery smell. The peony heart after dry-down is incredibly beautiful and compliments the other notes. For scent duration I found one spray lasted the whole day. I sprayed at 6:30AM and by 7PM a family member said they could still smell it on me. As long lasting as it is I noticed I couldn't really smell it after 4 hours - this isn't a bad thing necessarily, but it could lead to feeling of needing to spray more. Don't fall for it! One spray is more than enough."

It's flowery, but sweet at the same time and just so pretty. I think this is very versatile and can be used to go out or just a normal day around the house. I also love the millennial pink color of the bottle, it's a must have collectible bottle! I feel like this is most deff a crowd pleasing scent. You can buy this as a gift and know that the person will more than likely like it. It's not as scandalous and loud as the original GG, but maintains some of the og DNA. Cannot go wrong with this one!"

The Good Girl Blush Eau de Parfum comes in a stunning pastel-pink stiletto glass bottle and has a floral scent, both of which exude elegance. The bottle itself is so beautiful, and would look gorgeous on any vanity. The nozzle on the bottle does spray well, and allows for an even spritz.   The notes of the fragrance include mandarin, peony, rose, ylang-ylang and vanilla. The first ingredient on the list is alcohol, and it definitely is very alcohol forward when you first spray it. However, as the alcohol smell dissipates, you're left with a lovely sweet floral scent. It is a very youthful scent, but I think women of all ages can appreciate it. The perfume is supposed to become more intensified with the warmth of your body, and thus, really is meant to be sprayed directly on the skin. I find that when I spray it in the creases of my elbows and behind my ears, the scent lasts all day on me - I have tested it, and it lasts more than 12 hours. However, if I just spritz it on my clothes, the scent fades fairly quickly."

I would definitely purchase a large bottle of this when I run out of the others. I do not, however, think you need to have multiple versions of this at the same time since they are so very similar.

Itu2019s a soft vanilla floral with a tiny hint of spice ( which I could have done without). I also found that it smells very similar to a Justin Bieber perfume I used to use years ago.

I sprayed it on myself and my jacket and even after a full day of wearing it at work, the scent was still going strong. the next day I rewore my jacket, the smell was still there!

This one is sweet, but less sweet than itu2019s predecessors. To me, this is a powdery floral on a bed of not quite gourmand vanilla. More like the vanilla of a lotion. Iu2019m not exactly sure what peony smells like, but I do get a bit of a chalky floral so I imagine thatu2019s the peony. I can also smell rose, but itu2019s not prominent, more of an accent. Overall I feel like this works best for daytime, and can probably work well in any season. Although it may feel heavy in the hottest days due to the sweetness and the powdery aspect. Definitely smell before buying, liking the other good girls does not necessarily mean you will like this. And if you donu2019t like powdery fragrances, chances are pretty low that you will like this. To my nose itu2019s very different, and has a weirdness to it thatu2019s proving addictive."
